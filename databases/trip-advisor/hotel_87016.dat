<Content>Perfect for those new to Hawaii I have stayed at this hotel a total of 32 nights in the last year. I will say on the plus side that this is a great hotel for those new to Hawaii or those looking for a great place to stay without having to see the rest of Oahu. For those Gold and Diamond Hilton member beware. You can't get a room upgrade unless you pay about $40 extra a night. And an upgrade isn't really an upgrade. It just means you may be on the right side of the building to see fire works.. I was on the side that had to hear the noise from the from paid celebrations all night long. Not only couldn't I be moved without paying (as a Diamond member); when I tried to transfer to te Embassy Suites they threatened to fine me $ for leaving early. This was not satisfactory. I think if you are coming to Hawaii for the first time this is a good place. If you are a frequent visitor for business try the Embassy Suites.

<Content>A Nice Resort All in all, the Hilton is a good place to stay in Honolulu. It faces the best beach in Honolulu (although as others have mentioned, Waikiki beach is a bit over-rated, better beaches are on the North Shore of Oahu or on other islands). The hotel is very crowded and not for those who are looking to get away from it all; on the other hand, there is lots going on and if you are looking for a place where you can relax and not leave the premises (if you don't want to) it's good for that--the shopping arcade on the premises is very convenient. Check-in can be a hassle, with long lines. (Note, if you are staying in the Kalia Tower or the Ali'i Tower bypass the main check-in as these two towers have their own check-in desk). Each of the towers has its own pros and cons--rooms are fairly standard in each of the towers (slightly nicer in the Ali'i Tower). I was in the Rainbow Tower which is the closest to the beach (reason I chose it). But I've stayed in some of the others on prior visits and they are all pretty good.Some of the pros  --Rooms were very comfortable and well maintained (beds, towels, etc.). Housekeeping was excellent throughout the stay. --Great location on Waikiki Beach. --Self-contained resort...don't need to leave the premises if you don't want to (e.g., Japanese restaurant, pizza place, noodle house, steakhouse, convenience stores, etc. all on premises). --Staff were very friendly and pleasant.Some of the cons would be: --Pools are too crowded. The main pool, known as the super pool was probably sufficient in its day, but as they have added more towers it is now very crowded....if you don't claim a lounge chair by 9am you probably won't get one. The chairs are also very close together. --Internet access: Very expensive in the room (I paid $68 for 5 days access; alternatively, it is $15.95 plus tax per day). Judging by the # of people with laptops in the lobby areas, I think there may be free wireless access in the lobbies....but not in the rooms.  --Overall cost....yes, this is an expensive place. Internet access (as noted above) is expensive. Food is also very expensive--$14 for a hamburger at the pool, $10 for a footlong hot dog ($14 with all the works), etc. Most alcoholic drinks $12, soft drinks $5. It adds up very quickly. Also, if you want a chaise lounge ($15 per day) or umbrella ($35 per day) on the beach it becomes very expensive...I wish they offered some sort of discount for the 2nd, 3rd, etc. day rentals as $50 per day for a lounge and umbrella is a bit much for an extended stay. --Breakfast lines are very long (think of a Las Vegas buffet). Several of the restaurants were closed (Grand Dragon and Bali by the Sea due to the economy, Tropics Bar  Grill will reopen in April '09 after being remodeled). Wish they would lower the prices a bit (for food and beach rental) but I did enjoy my stay and will return.The HHV is family friendly. I would definitely recommend it to most, but if you are looking for a very quiet, serene type of get-away the HHV isn't for you.

<Content>Nice but bring plenty of money Beautiful place. Plenty of places to eat and shop on grounds and very nice rooms. We stayed in Tapa tower and were very happy with the rooms. The Gym is great as is the spa. The beach is nice but very crowded. They charge you for everything here!!! Want to use the gym $12.00. Want to use the shower at the gym? $18.00. Want to use a chair on the beach or a lounge? $25.00. Want to use a boogie board? $20.00. Want to use a kayak or a tricycle or pedal boat on the lagoon? $25.0 - $50.00. The staff is rude at the rentals and they don't take names if you are waiting to use something. That leads to you having to wait right by the stand the whole time, or you lose your spot. Guests start fighting over the rentals. Run very poorly and the nickle and diming is uncalled for as the place is very expensive.The restauarants and shops are very pricey. A soda is more than $5.00Do yourself a favor. Never eat breakfast on grounds. Very expensive. Walk out across the street. There is a 24 hour diner with excellent breakfasts that are very cheap. Cheaper than on the mainland.All in all a very nice place, but they need to be a bit kinder to the guests when it comes to charging for everything. The staff said everyone complains about it, and that they also agreed it is ridiculous.

<Content>hated this hotel The conference I attended was terrific. However, the outrageous unnecessary expenses make this a poor hotel choice in my opinion. Internet usage, for example, costs $16.00 per day, and you have no choice!!! Using the fitness center costs $13.00 per day. This is AFTER you have spent a great deal for each room. 3 minutes away you can stay at the Hawaiian Prince which has an ocean view for each room, is also beautiful, and has a more mellow and helpful atmosphere.

<Content>Crazy busy place. If you want lots of action, nightlife and shopping this is a great spot. Waikiki isn't a good Hawaii beach. It is dirty, very crowded and the water is cloudy. If you want excellent shopping and chain restaurants than this is the place. Besides that I'd say go to the Hilton on the Big Island for pristine beaches, great snorkeling, Hawaiian culture and endless outdoor activities.

<Content>diasppointed Hilton I am a Hilton Honors and Hiltion Grand Vacation Club ownerHilton prides itself on tremendous hospitality. Every other Hilton hotel I have stayed at gave great service and was most accommodating. Internet always FREE.We received no customer service or help to resolve issues at Hilton Hawaiian Village - Kalia Tower.Long lines/ delays at check inNo in-room coffeemakersHilton Honors and Hilton Grand Vacation Club Owners received no special treatment or perks.Reservation was confirmed for an ocean view room in the Tapa Tower. Was in the Kalia Tower - no view except of parking lot.No complimentary internet access - paid $68 for 5 days internet use - power outage for 17 hours unable to use internet during power outage and internet acccess cutoff early (received only 3-1/2 days internet use) - a total rip off :(Power outage was for 17 hours other towers provided flashlights in their rooms - no flashlights in our tower.Kalia tower was the last to receive power - we called to report we were still without power when all other towers and shops had power restored 2-1/2 hours earlier. Power came back on after we called within 10 minutes.Although, it was nice water hot/cold  toilets worked and one elevator worked in Kalia tower

<Content>It's gotten cheaper -- in more ways than one This was the seventh of the last eight Christmases at the Hilton Hawaiian Village's upscale Ali'i Tower. It was more economical, but the service plain and simply wasn't what it has been in previous years.The room itself was fine and scenic. I asked in advance for an upgrade to Ocean View Ali'i from Partial Ocean View Ali'i, and it was waiting on arrival. Also asked for a quiet room, and it was that, too. Room itself was fine, and the view of the Pacific from the 12th Floor for a retireee rate of $269 a night plus tax, including free hors d'oerves poolside each night, and (with my Hilton Gold membership) free continental breakfast, was in my opinion a good bargain. Also got a complimentary fresh fruit amenity plate on arrival.The price had dropped twice since I booked it in March -- Hilton didn't tell me this, but when I saw it on their website I rebooked it each time. Considering the category -- Ocean View Honolulu Beach Resort at Christmas -- I have no complaints about price.So, what's the problem?Mainly, housekeeping and service. Specifically, little things that were omitted. When you read this list, it will seem petty, but remember, the Ali'i Tower is supposed to be the upscale tower of the Hilton (Ali'i means elite in Hawaiian). Earlier this decade they used to have a fancy-white-uniform doorman at the tower door, and they serviced rooms three times daily (that was overkill, I admit -- even a bother-- but it shows how seriously they USED to take service. But now, no doorman, once-a-day housekeeping, and, my gripes: *No laundry/dry clean bags in the holder provided for them. *No ice bag liners for the ice buckets two nights out of five. *TV remote that wouldn't work, and when I called Guest Service Hotline rang so long it went to a recording. Finally got a human to take the TV trouble call, but then no one showed up and I had to call again. *Forgot to leave regular coffee packets the last day, only decaf.*Hilton bedside chocolates only one night out of five.*Poolside continental breakfast had now gone over $20 for those who weren't Gold members, the fresh-produce quality seemed to have declined, and they had switched to disposable plates and dishes, and plastic utensils.Is it still a decent hotel? Yes.Is it a good bargain? It certainly can be if you book carefully, and keep checking back. Sure was for me.Is it the luxury deluxe tower it used to be? Absolutely not.

<Content>Just ok I came here with a friend since she had some Hilton Points to use. How can anyone complain about Hawaii? The stay was OK. we were in what they considered the nice tower but we looked at a garage roof...it was a strain to see the beach. I don't prefer this environment because tourists don't want to leave! there is so much more to see and experience here. Too many of the same shops, and those cookies they leave you aren't so hot. But besides that, the location is a bit out of the way and you sit forever in traffic to get to it. walking isn't convienient to get down into the heart of Waikiki. The beach however, is great in front of the Hilton, hardly any coral, although each time I go back to the beach it seems to change. no matter where I stay I end up walking down the beach until I reach the strip by the Hilton. It's just not as crowded. But staying here, probably wouldn't do it again unless I got an amazing deal. I hardly spend time in a room anyhow. There is just so much to see and do. 8th time there will be a charm, and my goodness I still haven't done all there is to do.

<Content>Stuck up! We were so looking forward to going there! We'd travelled to New York and Las Vegas and Hawaii was our third and final destination on our honeymoon. Our journey leaving Las Vegas came to a halt when the airline we were due to travel on went bust! So after a long wait and long flight I was very excited to be arriving at our hotel! When we got there the guy behind the reception was VERY rude and patronising to us. Ok, we did not look our best as we'd been travelling for ages but he was so rude to us. Only when he saw that we had booked one of the nicest suites for our stay, he then couldn't do enough for us.Once we reached our room I was very disappointed. Although it was large-it was nothing special at all. The bed was uncomfortable and there was no great luxury to it. The rest of the hotel however was very nice with Flamingos and parrots and lovely restaurants! We finished our honeymoon by staying at the Wikiki Beach Hotel (which we had previously decided to book so we could access the other side of wikiki) I must say I loved it there and if I do ever go back to Hawaii- The Wikiki beach hotel will be my first choice as the Hilton was over priced for what it was.

<Content>Great Resort! GREAT RESORT, ESPECIALLY IN WAIKIKINever visiting Hawaii before, I was quite excited about coming especially since we were supposedly staying on a world class beach right? Think again. Before making our reservation at the Hawaiian Hilton, I was dancing back and forth deciding which resort to stay at. WE ARE SO LUCKY I made the right choice! Let me say, that my first impression of Hiltons Hawaiian Village, our first morning, was absolute paradise!After a day or so, we took a walk all the way down the Waikiki strip and viewed every hotel on the beach. The only hotels that were worth anything were the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the Military Hotel directly next door. Of course many of these hotels looked nice from the shopping front entrance of their property and were located in a very nice shopping and restaurant strip BUT their backyards were purely crap. Yeah, they looked alright from the front of their building but seriously lacked any bit of beachfront esthetics. Tiny, tiny, beach areas and yes of course, crowded due to lack of space. Most of them had very unattractive backyard grounds and pool areas, with the exception of a few who at least had like a nice looking dining area facing the ocean. The public beach areas of Waikiki were still not fabulous, but much better than what the strip hotels offered as a鈥?beach area鈥? We are a military family and we could have stayed at The Hale Koa but because of my husbands rank, it cost us the same to stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village because we got a great deal through Hilton package vacation deals on their website.  Although the Hale Koa still had much more beautiful grounds than the other hotels it still didn鈥檛 come close to what the Hilton Hawaiian Village looked like but it鈥檚 a great value and a very nice hotel for certain lower ranks of the military. It had many other features that were amazing however鈥?br/>The Hilton Hawaiian Village is quite kid friendly for kids who are 5 or over. Our child is 4 and a small 4 year old and wasn鈥檛 quite tall enough to really have a good time in the pools that all seemed to be 3鈥? to 4 feet deep. Lucky for us, due to the convenient location next door to the military hotel, we were able to present our military Ids and take our son the wonderful kiddie pool at the Hale Koa!How fortunate to have had access to their great pool that was only 1 陆 鈥渄eep and so many kids were delighted in there. The age limit was 6 years old so he made lots of friends close to his age and had a great time!Another option was to take our son to the lagoon. A totally renovated awesome ocean fed lagoon that could compare very much like a pool but it鈥檚 technically a beach. Read more below about this feature.On Our last two days I insisted that we purchase a good float jacket for our son and we enjoy the pools here at the resort. Bummer for our son but he had enough time in the kiddie pool next door. He really wasn鈥檛 crazy about this but we had to take turns because the pools here were sooooooooooo nice that it was a shame to have to go anywhere else. It was convenient for us to stay here and still be able to make use of the military facilities next door like the PX, restaurants and reasonable parking. We are not Hilton reward members so we had to pay premium prices to park, eat and use the workout room. PROS of staying at the Hilton Hawaiian VillageGorgeous grounds! Come see for yourself!Kid friendly and adult friendly at the same time. Several bird exhibits with elegant landscaping. Calm 鈥渂ay like鈥?beach and lagoonShopping and lots of it!Very comfy feather like beds! Restaurants: Lots of different eating establishments on the property and many pool and beach side convenient quick menus. Pools galore! 3 pools open to all guests but stay in the 鈥淎LI Tower鈥?and you gain access to an additional private pool and Jacuzzi on the second floor overlooking the resort. Awesome lagoon for the kids!Let鈥檚 talk about the pros!ENVIORMENT: As mentioned before, there is no comparison with the landscaped and property grounds beauty from any other hotel on the strip. Impossible to compare because there is none!You feel like you are in a tropical paradise here. Lots and various bird exhibits set in a very animal friendly environment and just very tastefully done. Staff was constantly caring for the gardens, koi ponds and even mopping outside areas! Great customer service everywhere on the resort. Staffs from the reception desk to the janitorial workers were always very friendly and courteous at all times. My husband turned to me one day and said 鈥渆veryone is just so happy here!鈥?br/>SHOPPING: If you truly don鈥檛 want to leave the resort鈥?anything you will need is here including a United States postal office! Shopping and eating galore!If you can get a deal staying in the Ali tower, you gain access to a private pool on the second floor with a private Jacuzzi and eating area. ABC stores on premises.EATING: When we stayed here their was construction going on so some of the buffets normally offered like at the Lanai restaurant were closed. They looked impressive but for us, we didn鈥檛 get to try it out. Bummer it looked like they had a lot of cultural foods too which would have been neat to try.At the Tapa Caf茅 which is right below the Tapa tower, they had a variety of buffet options for breakfast only however, their most expensive buffet had EVERYTHING! I鈥檓 not a very hungry breakfast person however but it pretty much was like eating breakfast and lunch selections so I would say if you鈥檙e a football player and require a huge calorie intake, this is the best value for your money which cost something like $23.00 per person. Keep in mind that they had less expensive breakfast options for those with smaller appetites. Down by the pools and the beach front, they had a great continental breakfast buffet with great selections for $15.00 and a great view! I wasn鈥檛 crazy about their lunch/dinner menu for the moneys worth but the breakfast buffet was quite reasonable and available until 10:00 am. I did like the outdoor seating with a nice atmosphere.I personally preferred to venture off down the strip to find a restaurant to eat at. We ate at a few restaurants on the resort but they were quite spendy and not as tasty for the price as some of the other restaurants away from the resort. The malls within a mile or so away had great restaurants at more mainstream prices. For those of you not wanting to leave the resort, there were many many smaller restaurants on the resort that had more reasonable prices. KID FRIENDLY H20 ACTION!Very h20 friendly for the kids at quite reasonable prices. Beach and Water gear for the kids was very reasonable at many convenience shops here at the resort. ABC stores were the best! They will even blow up the ducky rings and other various flotation devices for the kids free of charge. Very h20 friendly for the kids at quite reasonable prices which was a nice.Beach and lagoon here at this resort perfect for very little ones.The lagoon has a nice smooth shallow entry for young ones but it will still get deep in parts so use caution. (5 ft) Smooth sailing here in the lagoon and in the beach area of the resort. No harsh waves whatsoever just smooth bay like water. As mentioned before, the kid pool here isn鈥檛 quite shallow enough for 3-4 year olds BUT it is heated to a very nice temperature and your toddler can still go in with an approved floatation device. (Lifeguards are specific to which types are not allowed so check with them first)The lagoon is awesome for little ones. It鈥檚 very pretty and scenic but you have to rent a chair if you want one here. Smooth white groomed sand beach area and it鈥檚 just gorgeous. Are you a runner? Nice running track around the lagoon too; 3 times around equals a mile! (According to the towel attendant).CONSWireless no and Ethernet cable short! Expensive too! 10.00 for an hour or 68.00 for 5 days!No laundry facilities (unless you reside in the timeshares)No Jacuzzi (except if you stay in alli tower)Local phone calls 1.50 eachWell, that is all I have to say folks! Feel free to email me for any suggestions or questions. acker19@yahoo.com

<Content>Magnificent as always My husband and I do the Honolulu Marathon each year and like to stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village because of its proximity to the starting line, and is within a nice walk from the finish line.We book the Ali'i tower for its views and private pool (I know, I know, Waikiki is right there and we stay in the Ali'i tower for the POOL?). The Ali'i tower also has its own check in desk, which allows you to bypass the lines at the general reception desk.From start to finish, folks at this hotel have been so gracious and the service to all their guests has been nothing short of personable and genuine. Rita at the front desk of the Ali'i tower was so sweet. We booked a room rate called 'Best Available', which means you pay a low price, but they choose where to put you. It can be a gamble, but on this visit, it paid off. Rita told us our scheduled room wasn't available, as it was still being cleaned. But she said there was a room that was ready but it was one floor down and three doors over. She then said that in her personal opinion, she thought we should wait for the original room, as it had a superior view. I was tired from the travel and wanted to get to a room to relax, but after she said that, my husband and I chose to wait for the original room. So we went and ate. Rita called my cell phone to let us know when the room was ready (which was less than an hour later) and I was very glad we waited. We were given room 1309 - it's an 'ocean view' room, but it was better than the 'ocean front' we've stayed in before!! With a framed view of Diamond Head in the distance, a gorgeous view of Waikiki Beach and great views of Fort DeRussy below; I couldn't have asked for a better room to be in! Their rooms are quite comfortable and spacious. With a king size Hilton Heavenly bed and a sitting area to boot, you can't ask for much more. The bathroom dressing area has a small fridge that we used to store water and snacks, and their room safe is free of charge. It's large enough to store a laptop, should you decide to bring one.Their bathroom products are CrabtreeEvalyn La Source shampoos, conditioners, bath gels, etc. I love those products. They are replaced every day. We bought extra Kona coffee and sweetener to enjoy in our room, and housekeeping picked up on the fact that we don't drink decaf, so she removed the decaf packets and supplied us with double the amount of regular coffee. How perceptive! She also left extra condiment packets, seeing that we would need more creamer. :)The restaurants we ate at were mostly CJ's Deli and Round Table Pizza. CJ's Deli has great Loco Moco, although they don't put beans in it. For $15, it's quite a good meal. I highly recommend it if you haven't had Loco Moco before (get the traditional Loco Moco, not the meatloaf Loco Moco for an authentic Hawaiian experience). Round Table pizza is 'okay' if you want some pie, but it's so-so, though their Caesar dressing is classic; made with anchovies or anchovy paste.The weather this visit was not very good! We were on Oahu Dec 11th through the 15th and it rained most days, so we didn't get too much beach time or pool time. But we still enjoyed it. After all it's Hawaii, so how bad can it be, right?BTW: Tropics Beach Bar and Grill in the Ali'i tower is under construction for remodeling, and is due to open April 2009. So no appetizers by the Ali'i Tower pool, and no awesome breakfast. However, I highly recommend the restaurant in the Tapa Tower for American breakfast buffet. It's full of good eats and if you leave hungry, it's your fault. Hah!I highly, highly recommend this hotel for anyone that hasn't been to Hawaii; you're in the middle of a great spot on Waikiki, great views, great food nearby, great service with a smile ... you can't go wrong with this hotel. -Jen

<Content>Nice, but busy I earned a trip to this resort through work. My husband and I were very excited as neither of us had been to Hawaii and we decided to take our 3 kids with us. Once in a lifetime trip, right? Well, the staff was very friendly and the facilities and rooms were nice. Nothing special. What caught me the most was how busy it was and the price. Thank goodness for the 24 hour coffee shop around the corner that offered reasonable meals. I would not stay here again, but since I did not pay for it, what the heck!

<Content>If you are a nitpick, then don't travel. This place is cool. Out of 1000 reviews, I think I read 800 of them regarding this place. I almost changed my reservation because of the few bad ones. I am glad I didn't. I am simply amazed at some of the unfounded comments about HHV and the expectation level of some of these people. So I felt compelled to debunk them. First of all, I am a Hilton Diamond member and have travelled the world. Some paid, some free on points. I have always been treated with respect at Hilton properties whether I paid or not. I have had very few issues at any Hilton property. That being said, I expect very little when I travel and plan for the worst. I have never written a review of a hotel because I feel they contain far too many personal preferences to create a valid, central view.For reference, I am not the type of person to crawl around on the floor and look for missing carpet fibers or sniff the walls to see how fresh the paint is. I expect some noise, it's a HOTEL full of people. I expect that hotels, especially tropical resorts, to have some level of wear and tear due to the climate and the volume of guests. I expect hotel staff to be tired of overly demanding people so I tend to commiserate with them, not berate them. I am not a food snob. I do not live to eat nor does food define my persona. I do not pick places to go based on their selection of restaurants. Perhaps my palate is unrefined. Or perhaps, it's just that I am not a pretentious person. For instance, I drink wine that I enjoy, not to find the subtle tones of oak or a wild berry finish. The common theme of my review is cost - I try not to be cheap, but in these times, stretching a dollar means a lot and I think it's important to know what you're getting into. Besides, you won't find another beachfront hotel in Waikiki that is any different. Here we go;1. For Gold and Diamond members - I'm not sure why someone said they were scolded for taking milk out of the executive lounge - there isn't one there. No big deal, few Hilton resort-type properties have one. I have been to many good executive lounges and more than a few not-so-good ones. Not having one is no issue here, especially when the views are so good and it is much more enjoyable to sit on your balcony with your favorite drink. I bought drinks and snacks and put them in the fridge in my room. If you don't have a room with a view, create one and sit on the beach with your favorite drink. Rating - N/A2. True - breakfast lines were somewhat long - especially around 9am. By that I mean 20 minutes, NOT an hour as reported. So either get up earlier or go later - they're open til 11am. I had a breakfast coupon so the continental buffet at HHV was free (normally $20). Upgrading to the hot buffet ($29) was obviously around $10. You can save a lot of money if you don't have a breakfast coupon by going across the street to the diner. I ate a few lunches at the diner and the food was good - but it is a diner. If you are a food snob, then don't go to it. I didn't see any parsley on the plate and there isn't a sommelier. Rating 8 out of 10 for the horrendous 20 minute wait.3. Yes, food is VERY expensive at HHV. Again, there are many restaurants within a few blocks (at most) and you can find cheaper food very easily. If you are catatonically lazy and don't want to walk a block or two, then expect $20 cheeseburgers and $30 pizza at HHV. I find that ridiculous, but maybe my inferior palate is missing the fusion of the pizza cheese or something. Rating 2 out of 10. That much for food is criminal. But, you have choices so I gave them a 2.4. Never had trouble getting a beach towel. Never. Ever. True, the pool chairs are right next to each other and they fill up quickly, get there early. You have to crawl in from the end, there is no room on the side. But then the complaint would be there weren't enough chairs if they removed some for space. Again, Waikiki beach is steps away and there is plenty of room. And yes, as one person complained, staff does help to control children when their parents are incapable of being a parent. I find that incredibly refreshing. I guess it does take a village to raise a kid - if you're a bad parent. Rating 10 out of 10. NO, an 11 out of 10 for having the guts to handle unruly kids and keep the resort atmosphere for all.5. Check-in times were normal. check-out times were just as normal. Maybe a few minutes? However, if you wait until a busload of people get dropped off and then get in line behind them - your check in experience will probably be a little sluggish. Call me crazy. Or worse, get behind a certain tourist from a certain country who wants to debate their bill line-item by line- item and not want to pay tax. Not the hotel's fault. Rating 9 out of 10.6. Go to Ala Moana Center - they have a Long's Drugs and you can buy things like drinks and snacks more cheaply than the ABC Stores nearby. You can maybe walk if you are ambitious- or take the trolley or bus. If you have a car, the parking is easy and free.The ABC Store off-site of HHV is slightly cheaper than the one on-site and a good option. Rating N/A.7. Staff wasn't rude overall. Yea there were a couple of minor incidents, but I shrugged them off to Hawaiian cultural differences. The day I can look in the mirror and say I haven't had my share of moments is when I can be critical of others. Give them a break, they have to deal with people- and I kid you not - who demand they answer why the water in the ocean was cloudy (it had rained that day and there was minor run-off. Very minor. I could still see the bottom of the ocean from 8-10 feet.). Another complained about Honolulu traffic. How that is the resort's fault still baffles me. If you want some fun, hang out in the lobby and listen to what the hotel guests ask or request of the staff. And then decide how long YOU could maintain a pleasant demeanor. Yes, it's their job - but it's their job to help, not be a slave. Besides, the day it rained they offered us a free umbrella to use - without us asking. Rating 8 out of 10.8. I suppose that the hotel room decor could be considered a little dated. I only noticed because of the numerous comments on here about it. I didn't find it dirty, unsafe or hazardous so I'm not sure what dated truly means. I guess that they don't have granite countertops? Do you change your carpet and furniture bi-annually? They were re-doing two rooms on our floor and the workers let me look in. One version had hard wood floors and the other had a mixture of carpet and tile. But beware - if you think it's expensive now, wait until all the rooms are re-done. Who do you think is paying for the opulence? Rating 8 out of 10.9. Ah yes, speaking of cost - someone complained the place is too expensive. I paid $200/night at HHV. When I returned, I paid the same amount at a Hampton Inn in Maryland. Maryland...Hawaii...big difference, same price. Hilton lists their properties in Honolulu as category 6's with one exception - Doubltree that is listed as a 5. That means they're the most expensive and cost the most points if you redeem for a free night. Could it be - just maybe - that you're paying that much because it's Hawaii and an in-demand destination and not - oh I don't know - as in demand as Orangeburg, South Carolina?! No, the hotel rooms aren't opulent, they're reflective of a resort. But I doubt you'll come home with the plague because the carpet wasn't changed after the last guest. Rating 8 out of 10.10. Another one said this place has a bad beach. Huh? It's at the end of Waikiki! I guess that means the entire beach is bad? I will say that the sand (on the entire beach) was more grainy than I had thought and became painful to walk on for a distance. I live at a beach so I'm used to it, but this was unusually grainy. But that isn't an indictment about the beach at all, just an observation. Rating 10 out of 10.11. Don't simultaneously complain about construction work and also about dated rooms. You can't undate a room without construction. I didn't hear the workers three rooms down and they tore out the entire room all day, every day. I heard some noise outside and some people 25 floors down at the beach. I also heard the ocean, some birds, the wind and some boat horns. They are also re-doing a couple of restaurants. Again, the complaint would be the dated restuarants if they left them as-is. So what, sound travels. Give me the Nobel prize for figuring that out. Rating 9 out of 10.12. Based on my honors level, I was upgraded to an ocean view. No, not every room or every tower has an ocean view. If that's what you want, then pay the higher charge for an ocean view. It's listed plainly on the web site as to what type of room you are getting when you click on it. There is no secrecy about it. Rating 10 out of 10.13. Someone said you need an armed guard to escort you around. I am not even responding to that it's so ridiculous. Rating 11 out of 10.14. I parked my own car because I know valet service takes longer and I like to be in control of my own time and destiny. If you think you will have a personal valet that will deliver your car in nanoseconds, then park it yourself and save the self-imposed frustration. It isn't that big of a deal to do it yourself. Rating 5 out of 10 due to cost factor. $24 a day to park is too steep.15. HHV doesn't nickel and dime you to death, they dollar you to death. Parking, internet, in-room safe, food...but show me a Hilton that doesn't. If you want free parking and internet, stay at a Hampton....or a Holiday Inn. Rating 7 out of 10.16. Get the coupon books at the fornt desk, they may help a little depending on your buying wants and needs.17. Speak Japanese and be very aware that you are really in east Tokyo. Rating 0 out of 10.Some will argue I was there during the 'off-season. Maybe. But the Honolulu marathon was going on that week and there were 30,000 people for it. Plus there were numerous conventions around. It seemed slammed to me. I think the place was cool. It has lots of shops - and some bargains if you look. Overall, some prices on some items in the shops are cheaper than stores around the island. There are a few restaurants closeby (Outback, the 24hr diner, McDonalds, Red Lobster, Subway, etc.) and more down Kalakaua Avenue. Go to the International Marketplace for trinkets and tee's - the best deals are the vendors in the back of that massive area. It's about a 20 minute walk without window shopping. Along Kalakaua Avenue are the fancy stores (Coach, Burberry, Polo, Tiffany, etc.). The trolley system is easy to figure out, it's color coded based on what you want to do (shopping, dining, etc). Hilo Hatties has their own shuttle to their main store on Nimitz Hwy. it's a great place for souvenirs too.When I go back, I'm staying at HHV. It's on the beach, easy to get to, fairly decent location on Waikiki (albeit the end) and has beautiful grounds. You can stay here on a budget, you just have to work at it a little. It's worth the effort for the views and the convienence. Don't listen to the bad reviews, having been there, I have no idea what those people are referring to. If they are truly that picky, they need to stay home.

<Content>Not as good as it could be We stayed here at the end of our Island excursions, saving the resort feel for the last leg of our travels. As Honors members of Hilton and other fine hotels, we have come to assume a certain level of quality and service; these standards were not reflected at this location.For example check in proved to be a much larger ordeal than any of the other Hiltons we stayed at on other trips. When we inquired about changing our breakfast reservation the desk attendant informed us that it was too late and I quote her here, You snooze you lose, you should have changed your reservation before arrival. She did not bother to inform us that the restaurant in the Rainbow tower was closed for renovation and that there would be hour long lines for our included breakfast.Additionally, the so called spa treatments are over priced sales pitches. I am a bodyworker and have travelled extensively and received body work from many hands and of many disciplines. People should not be fooled into thinking this is a legitamate spa. I booked the Around the World massage for 80 minutes at a rate of $200. This was by far the worst massage I have ever had and requested the practictioner stop before the time was up. There was no reflexology, no shiatsu and no other methods despite the listing in the spa menue of services In fairness the young woman simply did not know how to do anything outside of Swedish.We were billed for the full amount of service and I am not pleased. Additionally pool towels are hard to come by and over all service at this hotel is not what we have received at other Hilton hotels. We found the staff to be rude, unaccomodating and uninterested in hospitality.Honestly I felt like we had booked a stay at a large mall and will not visit this hotel again.

<Author>HawaiianIslands
<Content>Not the same due to a change in management I have stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village 3-4 times a year for the past few years. Up until recently it had always been a great hotel due to its location, rooms, and service. Earlier this year changes were noted during a stay at the Kalia Tower, for instance some of the extra bathroom amenities. When asking the maid about it she went onto explain that a change in management had ocurred and there were many cutbacks. Another change was the elimination of the executive lounge that served breakfast and snacks at the Kalia Tower. Another employee that we knew from previous visits confirmed that cost cutting changes had been made by management. On this last visit while staying at the Alii Tower requests were made to change the sheets using the change the sheets request card located on the night stand. Each time the card was put out on the bed the sheets were not changed. There was a stain in the top left corner of the sheets and each time we came back to the room it was evident the sheets had not been replaced as requested. Upon entering the room hair from the previous guest was found in the bathtub and toilet area. Not sure if the maids just have too many rooms to clean now and need to cut corners to keep up.I would definitely return to the hotel but hope these little things are corrected.

<Content>dont waste your money on Hawaii Hotel property is nice, rooms are ok but the service is HORRIBLE. Everyone here is rude and unfriendly. We travel alot and are extremely disappointed by our first trip to Hawaii. There is no schedule for when restaurants and bars open. If you ask an employee a question they seem annoyed. We called room service to order a pizza and we were told we could not order pizza (even though it was on the menu) because it was raining so they could not guarantee that our order would correct when it arrived. WHAT? Are we on candid camera here? Taxi drivers wont even acknowledge female customers unless a man is present. No wonder the economy is bad here. The only people that come are the ones that dont know there are much better places to visit. Save your money and the long flight. Go to the bahamas instead. They treat you much better and are happy that you are there to visit!

<Content>Nice Hotel - Great Views- Stayed here for 4 nights. Checked in on 11/28 and departed on 12/02. This place is huge. We took a shuttle from the airport. Other reviews were right. It is a LONG walk from the airport shuttle drop off area to the front desk. My husband and I got our luggage together and started walking - THEN one of the bellmen at the shuttle drop off asked if we needed help. We declined.....Check in was easy - I am Gold and my husband is Diamond Hilton Honors so we had a quick check in; however, there was a long line to check in if you weren't. Our room was on the 35th floor in the Tapa Tower. We had a beautiful ocean view. We got a free continental breakfast each morning. We enjoyed that perk. The servers in the breakfast restaurant were very prompt and friendly. We did the time share presentation and was given a voucher for the hotel. We opted to use the voucher (+ a few more $$$) to get a couples massage in the spa. The spa is nice with steam sauna, hot tubs, etc. the massage was great!!! The rooms were large and the beds were very comfortable. Walls were a bit thin and we could hear our neighbors next door. The ABC Store was great for snacks, drinks, etc. Pool was nice. It was not crowded when we were there. The hotel is a good 10 - 15 min walk to the main part of Waikiki. This was a nice hotel, but I would probably not stay here again on another trip to Honolulu. It is just too big and is not close to a many restaurants and shops (except those on property).

<Content>Great Hotel I was wary of this hotel due to all the negative comments but we had a great stay here. I found the staff friendly. We were upgraded to an ocean view room and was pleased to see we had a balcony. The fridge in the bathroom was a good idea - we could enjoy a cold beer bought from the ABC store watching the sunset from the balcony.  There was some contruction noise but we were notified regarding this from our travel agent. We used the small Spa swimming pool and there were always plenty of sunbeds.  We mostly ate out in the evening - lots of places on Lewers Street - highly recommend P.F Chang's.

<Content>Review for the Business Traveler The Hilton Hawaiin Village is a great hotel for the business traveler. It's in a good location nearby the main roads, and a short walk down the beach/road to some great restaurants. The cost of eating and drinking at the hotel itself is the equivalent of a major mainland city like NY or DC ($10 drinks). Rooms conveniently have internet access (not sure if that is typical for all Waikiki hotels). For those nights you come back from work and are too tired to venture out into Waikiki, the hotel is very self-serving. As other travelers mentioned, it truly is a village. ABC (convenience) store, coffee shop, ice cream store, many other shops, etc. provide things to do when you don't want to sit in your hotel room but also don't want to go big after a day on the job.

<Content>Big is not always beautiful Firstly I should explain two things. I am a Diamond Card holder with the Hilton Group which enables me to receive upgrades on rooms. Secondly my wife and I are well travelled and neither of us will see 50 years old again.This resort is big. Too big to cope with the numbers of people staying in the 5 towers (each a hotel ) which comprises this resort . Another tower is being constructed for Vacation Club subscribers. The 'village' also includes about 50 shops and restaurants, which provides some on site fun, but the main 'high street' is only a 10 minute walk away and is amazing in its size and quality of shops.Our room was great. On the 34th floor out of 35 and with a nice balcony with a sea view. The room is a good size but is not well insulated. The door mechanisms are so robust that you have to slam the door to close it. You will hear doors slamming shut at least 3 rooms either side of you. If there are boisterous people above you you will hear then through the ceiling.You will need to be sharp to get a seat around the pool. There are not enough sunbeds and each one is butted against the one next to it so there is no privacy and, frankly, you have to be careful if the person next to you suddenly flattens the sunbed as fingers could be hurt. The beach is not part of the Hilton village so you will need to hire sunbeds for the beach at about 10 pounds a day. Reed mats can be bought cheaply at the on site supermarket.The breakfast arrangements are awful and you will find yourself queuing for up to 20 minutes to be seated for breakfast. Not a good start to the day, but an opportunity for one person to queue and the other to reserve a sunbed.There is no Executive lounge (for the information of cardholders).Entertainment is provided several times a week, always at a cost.This resort came at the end of a week in Hong Kong and 2 weeks in Sydney and we were lucky with the weather. It provided a warm and relatively attractive recuperation after 3 weeks of non stop activity and sightseeing. It ticked many of the boxes needed but the aforementioned deficiencies mean that I would not go there again.

<Content>A beautiful, well maintained hotel My wife, and I, stayed at the HHV for 8 days. Believe me, when they call this place a village, it is. The grounds are immaculate, with beautiful flowers, birds, coi fish, and my favorites, the penguins.We stayed in the rainbow tower, 30th fl., and had 2 balconies, one overlooking the beach, and the ocean, and the other, overlooking the lagoon, and downtown. The queen sized bed, was comfortable, and there was plenty of room. My only complaint about the room, was the refridgerator was too small.The super pool was nice, and we never had a problem finding chairs to lay on. You have to try the poolside grill. The cheeseburgers were delicious, and the hot dog, had to be more than a foot long. The chili that they put on the hot dog, tasted like home made.We rented a car, from Advantage, which only cost $189, for the time that we were there. It's very easy to get around. A good map will get you anywhere that you want to go. We drove up to the North shore, to watch the surfing championships, and to stop at Masumoto's, for shaved ice, which is worth the trip.We went to Pearl Harbor, around 11:00, and had no problem getting in. They move you through fairly quickly. You watch a 10-15 minute movie, and then take a Navy shuttle out to the Memorial. It was a very moving experience, and I couldn't believe how everyone was so quiet. It really showed respect to our hero's who are entombed in the USS Arizona, which just lyes 6 feet under you.We also toured the mighty Batteleship USS Missouri. Take the tour with a guide, it's worth the extra cost.We were disappointed with the Spirit of Honolulu, dinner cruise. We were supposed to get filet, and lobster, instead, the lobster was replaced with crab claws. I wouldn't recommend the Atlantis submarine, either. It cost us over $200, and you couldn't see hardley anything. The things that they take you to see are artificial (reefs). The ship, and plane, were purchased, and sunk, to make reefs. Go para-sailing, it's more fun, along with being cheaper.The ABC store is the place to purchase your basic goodies. They have everything that will suit your needs.For breakfast, there is a nice restaurant, that's also open 24 hours a day, about a block to the left, after you go out of the main entrance.We had a wonderful time, and would definately stay here again.

<Content>Great Location, some issues.... Booked two rooms at govt rate. Booked for 19-22 although we were arriving from Korea on the 20th to ensure a room at 0700 on the 20th.Arrived and I had no room. They then said I could get a room but I'd have to move at noon. I thought this was unacceptable since I had paid for a room beginning the night before. I asked for an upgraded room if I had to move. I was then magically given a room. I figured it would be bottom of the barrel and I was right. It was in the Diamond tower which I think it one of the oldest. It was bare bones, but decent.The location, ammentities, and shops were great! I used the Mandara Spa, pool, and gym. Pricey, but nice.Checkout was insane. There were so many ppl standing there and the system was down. Not effecient at all.Would probably try this place again, not too sure.

<Content>noisy time Just got back from 3 weeks in the states of which 7 nights were at this hotel , upon arrival got upgraded from the Diamond tower to the ali tower free of charge which was very good , The biggest issue was the construction work going on directly below the pool at the ali tower and this could be heard all over the resort and it will be going on well into 2009 so beware if you like peace and quiet you will not get it here , I agree with others ref cost of food and drinks it was very pricey but in true British style we found the harbour pub just past the lagoon and this place was cheap , we spent a full afternoon in it with plenty food and drinks and the bill was 40 dollars , Also note in the ali tower you get free snacks between 17:00 hrs and 19:00 hrs which were nice , this hotel does have a very good beachfront location just remember the building work .

<Content>Depends on what youu pay for this hotel This hotel may be worth staying in depending on what you have to pay for it. We had two rooms for 4 nights, booked on Priceline for $200/night each. We were upgraded to the Rainbow Tower on the water at no additional cost. The tower you are in is very important, since only a few have a decent water view and many are back away from the water with no water view. We had a very nice view looking out on a marina with the ocean and coast beyond. The grounds and common areas are actually very nice with lush landscaping. The resort is set up as a number of high-rise towers with the pools and landscaping between. There is also quite a number of shops and restaurants in a village type atmosphere. My reason for not rating the resort higher are two. First, the rooms are very dated, and two, the resort tends to try to get every last dollar out of you by charging you for everything they can. The furniture in our rooms was very dated and more like what you would find in an older Holiday Inn and not a luxury resort. While the bathrooms had been redone, they left the old sinks and faucets, which are very dated. The 3 sinks even had rust around the drains they had been there so long. The hotel had no chairs to use on the beach unless you paid an unreasonable fee to use them. The resort is actually very attractive and in a nice location, an easy walk to the shopping at Waikiki but in a nice quieter area. If you can get a very reasonable price, the Hilton may be worth considering. If you are not getting a decent discount I would stay elsewhere in a place that had more up to date rooms.

<Content>It was a great vacation at HHV! We just got back from a 3-night stay (thursday - sunday) at HHV. Honestly I had my doubts before we got there, since the latest reviews (a week before our arrival there) were kind of negative. BUT... it was such an awesome experience staying at HHV. We booked the package from Costco, and we had ocean-front room on the 15th floor in the Rainbow tower. beautiful, beautiful view, day or night. Also, after 7 pm, there is live music from the bar on the beach. We took our daughter with us and she was a bit jet-lagged, so after she fell asleep at 8 pm, my hubby and I just sat on the balcony sipping coffee and enjoying the music and the sound of the wave from the ocean... totally relaxing. oh.. the maid service was great too. We usually tip about $5 everyday, and the lady was so nice to leave us extra coffee or towels if we requested them. the food was above average too. Some reviewers said the price was high, which might be a bit true for room service, because i noticed they charged $6 per person in addition to the usual fee charged for room service at other hotels. We ordered breakfast twice and it was $70 each time for my hubby and me (i.e., American breakfast, $27, Pancakes $19, then the rest of the cost goes to the service charge and tax and $6 per person order, and something else). If you eat at other places on site, then the price seems pretty much the same as other hotels in Waikiki. btw, the noodle shop on site has very yummy food and the price is about $10 per soup (or for one order of fried rice or curry beef combo). we dined there a lot since i fell in love with their chicken/veggie noodle soup (this one, the noodles are made of some kind of soybeans and the waitress called it 'clear noodle soup').This is our 3rd visit to the area, and I think HHV is the best hotel among all the three we have stayed (Marriott couldn't hold a candle to HHV -- we stayed there two years ago. the beach across the street of Marriott is rocky and narrow, service also wasn't as great, and not much for kids to play with there). At HHV, the beach is wide and nice and soft, and there are lagoon, koi, duck, penguin ponds. On top of that, fireworks on Fridays. My daughter totally loved everything, and HHV is truly a great resort for family vactions. All in all, HHV is more than what I expected... the check-in wasn't bad and the staff was nice (really nice). the property is big yet it doesn't feel exhausting at all to walk around. remember to get the rainbow tower (it is close to everything, beach, rainbow blazar, the main desk, etc.)... and if you can, get the oceanfront at the rainbow tower -- the view and the music (plus fireworks display which is right there)... is worth every penny -- we had a great time there and we will def stay there again next time. (last note... it was slow when we were there. i was prepared to wait in lines, but didn't see any... the taxi driver said it hadn't been as crowded as before, so maybe it is time to go:) ).

<Content>Overall Happy, hard to get food I've stayed here twice, but one thing stuck me this last trip...They don't offer room service after 10:00PM. All the hotel bar's close pretty early. I mean, it's not too much to ask to get a hamburger at 10:30PM. Any other Hilton I've stayed at offers room service at 10:30, most still are serving at that time in the bars. For hotel of that size not to offer meals at that time of night is just wrong. It's made worse by the size, you have to walk several blocks just to find food.My first time here, they upgraded me to a suite, it was an awesome room. The second time I was was here I also had a nice room.It's defanitely a nice hotel, great views, excellent location, I was otherwise happy except for the inability to get food after 10:00 PM

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian Village -- good points and a few disappointments I stayed in the Rainbow Tower which was a nice tower. I stayed at this property for 17 days. The location and property as a whole was indeed beautiful. It was clean and enjoyed the view of the Lagoon from my balcony -- sunsets are incredible. I did have a few issues with room service (quality of food) which were quickly resolved by management after phoning them. I did have some issues with my room (noise level of housekeeping storage room next to my room) which were not resolved by management and that was a disappointment. On the down side, many of the lounges and restaurants were closed. I do feel that too many of them were closed at the same time which was disappointing.

<Content>Nice Hotel We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in the Ali Tower for two nights. The location of this hotel was great. It has a lovely pool, is situated right on the beach and also has its own lagoon. There are 2 starbucks on the hotel grounds, but the coffee is more expensive than the other starbucks down the road. They have a waterfall, ponds with fish and also a display with real penguins. It is a very busy hotel and a lot of people, families moving around so if you are after a romantic getaway or honeymoon I think you would be disappointed.Our hotel room in the ali tower was ordinary. The bed was comfortable, the room clean but nothing to rave about. We had a balcony with a partial ocean view that was nice. It wasn't cheap though. The staff were helpful  friendly. When we arrived the computers were down and we had to wait for about half an hour to check in  they upgraded our room because of the inconvience, so we appreciated that. This hotel is within good walking distance to the main shopping area in Waikiki  only a trolley ride away from the Ala Moana Shopping Centre.

<Content>It'sa Hilton We stayed here for three nights in May 2007. Travelled to pick up some of the sights and had limited time in the complex itself, although, if you wanted to, you could easily spend your whole day within the hotel. You can walk and the grounds are very attractively laid out and beautifully maintained. The staff were very professional and efficient.We can understand the pervious comments regarding prices for restaurants etc in the hotel. However, when on hoilday we tend not to eat in the hotel anyway and usually find it easier for us to eat on the go. While the car park is not a great walking distance from the main reception, it seems a bit mean to make a daily charge for this.Overall this hotel has a very grand, almost palacial feel to it, and guests are made very welcome and therefore not uncomfortable in the 'luxurious' surroundings. We regret not having more time to fully enjoy all the hotel had to offer in our short stay and would like to come back one day!

<Content>Another fabulous vacation at the HHV! We spent two weeks at the HHV in July of 2008. This was our third trip to the islands and our second stay at the HHV. Despite having a party of seven, including three seniors and two small children, we had a fabulous time. We stayed in the Alii Tower, which really is worth the extra money. The staff was spendid. We never encountered a single rude employee anywhere. Just the opposite, actually. The rooms were clean and well-appointed. Since we traveled with several Hawaii first-timers, we opted for ocean view rooms and that's exactly what we got. Our window had a stunning view of Diamondhead, downtown Waikiki and the ocean. On our previously trip, our Alii Tower room was directly facing the ocean. We loved that as well, but I think this was even better. Basically, the view from our room was like a postcard.Many of the complaints voiced here are valid, but as long as you know these things before you book at the HHV you won't suffer from sticker shock. Yes, the on site restaurants are pricey. The beach chairs were $30 a day. With a little effort you can save a ton of money. Skip the breakfast buffet at the HHV and walk across the street to the small family restaurant on the corner. Great food, speedy service, great location. Skip the $30 beach chairs and stop at Walmart. Pick up beach chairs for $15 a piece and keep them in your room during your stay. When it's time to leave just donate them to another family just arriving. You've saved yourself a bunch of money and helped someone else out, too. The ABC store in the Village is a godsend. We stopped several time a day for fresh fruit, cereal, milk, munchies and sodas. The prices were MUCH better than the hotel's. Be sure to save your receipts. After checkout stop by and get your free gift. We ended up with a t-shirt and mug.A big compaint often mentioned is the timeshare pitches. Strong pressure is too strong a word in my opinion. If you ignore them they're easy to miss. On the other hand, if you've got a couple hours to spare (closer to three, actually), you can score some cool stuff. I'm a Hilton Honors member and they offered me 20,000 HH points for just listening to the spiel. Since we were staying for two weeks we found the time. 20,000 points is nothing to sneeze at. If you don't want the points, they'll give you a $125 credit at the hotels restaurants. At HHV prices, that amounts to a nice meal for two.Around the site, the pools were beautiful. The Super Pool chairs fill quickly in the morning, so be prepared to stake one out at 8AM or so. One thing we did notice was they were tagging unoccupied chairs. After 45 minutes or so of non-use they were cleared for someone else. That's cool. If you stay in the Alii Tower you'll have you're own pool on the second floor. Way less crowded, and a hot tub for the adults.The beach in fromt of the hotel is the best in Waikiki. It never got too crowded. Lots and lots of families. Be sure to check out the fireworks on Friday nights. They launch from the sandbar between the Lagoon and the ocean.During our stay, they started an on-site Luau on the lawn between the Lagoon and Rainbow Towers. We wanted a Luau on our vacation and since we had two small children, we opted to try it out. Being on site was nice. Within minutes we were back in our rooms. Since it was a new Luau there were no discounts or coupon offered. That's probably changed by now. We did enjoy the food and the entertainment.I was a bit concerned about the ongoing construction. There was nothing to worry about concerning the new Grand Waikikian Tower, as it was mostly complete. However, they were painting and refurbishing our side of the Alii Tower while we were there, so we had a couple ropes hanging over the balcony for a few days. Not too bad of a distraction. I chalk it up to bad luck on our part.We all really loved our stay and would go back again in a heartbeat.Maybe someday...

<Content>Awesome Place to Stay!!! We loved this place so much we are going back in a few weeks. I do not know why the other reviews give this resort such a bad rap! The staff were very nice and the check in was easy. We were given a room we did not book and within 15 minutes we were in the right room on the 31st floor of the Rainbow Tower. Whenever we needed anything it was taken care of right away. The room was nice and the views were awesome. Of course the food is a little pricey but you are in Hawaii and at a resort!!! I've stayed at a lot of upscale hotels in other cities and the food is always expensive. I guess these other people in the reviews never travel or are used to staying at Best Westerns! I live in Orlando and have paid more for food at Disney than in Hawaii! A good place to get breakfast off property is the Wailana across the street. The property is beautiful and there are a lot of shops and restaraunts in the village. It was nice to be right on the beach and they clean it every morning. You shouldn't go expecting to be waited on hand and foot like you are at the Waldorf. Just go and do your own thing and have a good time. The hotel is centrally located but out of the hustle of central waikiki. Within walking distance to the Ala Moana Mall. Great place to shop. Rent a car for more independence.

<Content>Good stay Having just arrived from the East Coast of the US, we were so jet-lagged that we only enjoyed the pool and the beach briefly before we moved on to Lanai. We were given an upgrade to the Ali'i tower, which is right on the ocean and also has it's own pool, a plus because the regular pool is a mob scene. The beach is great, soft white sand and plenty of it, an easy swimming beach also.Lots of choices for shopping and dining, I see why people would stay here for a week. My drawback is the construction that was going on in the Ali'i Tower, apparently they are doing work on all the balconies and that is definitely a drawback for people trying to enjoy the main pool.

<Content>OK - But overwhelming After staying at a quiet resort on Kauai, this was very overwhelming. It's like a little city within a big city. We actually got lost a couple times. There are 6 hotel towers! Staff was not terribly friendly and not very helpful. The location is okay, but the Sheraton resorts are much more centrally located as this hotel is way at the end of the strip of hotels on Waikiki. The standard rooms are small, no complementary coffee ($1.99) for the little packets in the room. Our room had hair still in the bathroom that needed to be cleaned and there was stuff underneath the bed from the prior guests. Obviously, cleaning problems. Although it is large, this is somewhat nice as there are a lot of tropical and exotic birds and fish in various gardens/habitats. Although we did not take a tour anywhere, the benefit is that most tours depart from here and then pick up at other resorts. But it's a short walk from the Sheraton or Royal Hawaiian.

<Content>Decent Stay....Below Expectations Overall Let's start from the top....Checking in was a less than desirerable experience. I was picked up at the airport by a shuttle and when we got to the hotel I was dropped off at the furthest point from the actual reception desk. I was offered help with my bags but I refused thinking that the desk was very close. Not the case....it was a long walk with my suitcase and 2 bags. When I finally made it to my room I was very impressed with the size and quality of the bathroom and the fact that I was on the 14th floor of the Alii Tower. Although not much of a ocean view it was wonderful to be up that high an see the surroundings. The private bar, pool, and hot tub were great in the tower.The bellhops were very helpful in getting taxis and information on where to go for a decent time in the evening. The housekeeping staff was very suspect considering that when I arrived back from a 9 hour day at the conference my room had been left ajar ever since they were done cleaning. As I opened the door I was happy to see my laptop still staring me in the face so I assumed nothing else was missing. That was mistake that could have turned into a much bigger problem if someone else had noticed that the door was open all day. I did notify the desk within the tower and they apologized.Location is great....kind of away from the city life because you are right on the beach. The location is unbeatable.Eating and shopping in the area was fun but it was soooo expensive. I do recommend two places...the ABC Store located right onsite. Stock up on stuff to keep in the fridge. Also, if you like sushi there is a great Japanese restaurant right next to the ABC store. The best sushi I have ever had.If I was going on vacation I would probably not chose this hotel but it was fine for a convention/business trip.

The rooms were out dated and the customer service was very poor. The staff wasn't as helpful as other resort properties. The grounds and beach are nice and a great location but honestly I would never stay again unless I was using my Hilton Honors points and not paying.I

<Content>poor Have recently returned from a week's stay at the HHV for what was the second part of our honeymoon. The week before, we stayed at and got married at the Wynn in Vegas. This was an unforgettable week with everything from start to finish superb. Firstly,as I had previously read, we were picked up at the airport and dropped off at the furthest possible point from the check in desk. It is hotel policy not to allow you to be dropped off within the drive thru opposite reception. There was no concierge within site and you had to carry your bags yourself for a ten minute walk. Once there, there was no real queue. We were congratulated on our wedding and told we would be given a special room.We had already upgraded to a deluxe ocean view room. Given our key quite quickly and made our way, again with no offer of help with baggage. Our room was 1607 in the Rainbow tower and was a twin room with a side ocean view! Not exactly a honeymoon room. We called down to reception, expressed our dissatisfaction, and after being kept on hold for 15 minutes, were told we would be moved to a corner deluxe room at no extra cost and to wait for a porter to come with new keys and help with baggage. 30 minutes later, no sign of anyone. We walked to the room with our luggage and waited outside the room. I phoned reception from a house phone, explained the situation and was put through to security who shouted that I should not have called them as it had nothing to do with them! 30 minutes later we got into our room, overlooking a building site of the new time share! Again we complained and were offered dinner for 2 at the buffet! being told we had already been upgraded and what more did we want.The hotel is very large,old and unfriendly. Staff do not want to know you, none of the remembering your name and smiling. Also,my wife who is 29 was asked for id every time she asked for a drink,from the same bar staff, and the most stupid thing is that it is only 1 drink per person. When I went to the bar and ordered a beer and wine,they would not serve me untill they saw my wife, who was sunbathing. When she came over, they made her go to her room to get id!The pool was overcrowded, even closed 1 day at 4pm for a conference. Basically, this is an overpriced holiday camp for Japenese tourists.If you are wanting a relaxed picturesque honeymoon or quiet holiday, do not go here.

<Content>Stay in another hotel Check-in was terrible. Don't trust what they promise or suggest on the phone...it won't happen. We were told our Hilton Honors points were worthless here... etc. etc. etc. All employees except the cleaning people were in a terrible mood. Not one Aloha... or thank you. Bad experience. Conrad Hilton would never tolerate his guests being treated so badly. Much less expensive hotels with much better experience.

<Content>didn't meet my expectation We stayed at Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu .........Service is awful.........and everything is so expensive at this hotel..........for a breakfast you spend arm and a leg so you can emagine a price of burger for lunch. my advice there is ABC store on site that is open till midnight buy whatever you need and leave it in your fridge for breakfast. request one cofee maker if you don't have it in your room............. there are lots of choices for lunch and dinner around walking distance.Porters just look at you while your are struggling to take your luggage with your two children and do not even help..........rooms are specious, and clean and maids work hard to keep them clean........landscaping was beautifulbeach is rocky and there are jelly fish in the water, so be careful.when you have seen caribean beach this is nothing. it is too developed for my liking....buildings everywhere........we did Catamaran tour thru American Express travel it was worth it.........my kids really wanted to do Submarine so one of us took them but too expensive for the stuff that you see, it is all artificially done underwater, two ship rack and an airplane and some piramid.......you see some fish and sea turtle around fish rack, turtles were the only amazing thing, they are huge.........we didn't see any dolphines or sharks...........you might as well go snorkling and you see it beautifully......and save tonnes of money.kids visited aqarium and zoo that they enjoyed............

<Content>Sadly, I probably won't return. My family stayed at the HHV from August 22nd through September 1st (a 9 night stay). This is my sixth stay at the hotel and sadly the spirit of aloha and service is gone. Several months before our stay Hilton was bought out by a private investment firm (Blackstone) and they are in the process of cutting all the extras they can to make the hotel look profitable in order to sell it again. Many of the staff members who greeted me in the past had been laid off or simply forced out. All of the concierges are being changed to timeshare staff so don't expect any real help in activity planning as it's all about the sales pitch. This has always been my favorite Hilton and everywhere I went the staff was overworked, unhappy and afraid of losing their jobs. Several of them spoke candidly to me about what was going on at the property. Operators at the hotel twice told me a restaurant on the property was open (and listed as open on my breakfast vouchers) and we walked over only to find it was closed for the entire day because they didn't want to staff it. The line to use breakfast vouchers (I am a Hilton Diamond member) at the Rainbow Lanai was a fifteen minute wait just to put your name in to wait for a table. We waited 30 minutes each day to be seated despite trying to go at different or earlier times each morning. After seeing what was going on we simply chose to eat our meals off property and walked a few hundred feet up the beach to rent umbrellas, chairs and kayaks at half the price Hilton was charging and from much nicer concession operators. The room we had in the Rainbow Tower was breathtaking and it was adequately cleaned each day, but once we left the room, the magic was gone. If you are planning a stay at the Alii Tower, be aware the doorman is gone and the concierges are slowing being canned or forced to sell timeshares. The decline in service is evident everywhere. If you get a great price go, but otherwise wait till improvements are made!

<Content>BIG prices for this big place My initial impression of this property was amazement( particularly after carrying my 40 lb. suitcase to the tower). An absolutely beautiful setting. I was attending a very large gathering of world class scientists, as a guest of one of the scientists. Pre-registration was to happen the day before the event started. However, there were no signs nor information. We finally found a reader board that read preregistration will be held in the Paradise Lounge. Maps of the property showed no Paradise Lounge. When we went to the information center the people there didn't know where the Paradise Lounge was either. The first day of the conference about 150 people showed up for the presentation only to find the room would hold 50 or so. With a couple of thousand people presenting their work the sound equipment seemed to feel the stress, several mics simply didn't function.The 5th night of the conference we attended a luau, for which we were charged $39. There were few places to sit. Finally we found two chairs together after we asked folks to move over. The chairs were so close together that the legs touched...and your shoulders touched the people on either side of you. The free drinks that were to be there were gone. The food arrived family style. Our server told us, as each item was served, you take only one piece and pass it down. (if you took more than one there was not enough food to go around) The entertainment was seen by those sitting very close to it. Those of us sitting away from that area of lawn saw heads of the performers only. I was disappointed to see a very similar presentation the next night at the King's Jubilee. Friday night guests are asked (if they want a chair) to pay $20 to attend the jubilee. We found a rock to sit on! And were told that we were not allowed that barricades would soon be erected and we must leave.Our room didn't have any info on local points of interest...ONLY points within the compound. Nothing about the local bus schedule nor about the free shuttle service. And no shuttle to and from the airport!The room was fine(only a few dust bunnies on the louvered doors). However, I found it to be rather odd to not have a top sheet, only a duvet cover that matches the bottom sheet. We were upgraded to the Ali'i Tower, with a private pool and spa, a hospitality room, and several other perks. No mention was EVER made of where these were located. And there were no signs telling where these perks were to be found. It felt as if one was forced to ask for all info...none volunteered.$12 mai tais! The diner across the street has GOOD ones for $3.25!I felt as if it is ONLY about the buck at this resort! Disappointment is what I feel from an experience that should have been Nirvana!Aloha,Judith

<Content>Remodel on Rainbow Tower My wife and I stayed in the Rainbow Tower. There were fantastic views from our corner room but the refurbishment of the air conditioners was noisy during the day. Some bathrooms were being remodeled also. This was pitched to us as a modest update to the rooms. Granted, they weren't tearing out walls with jackhammers but it was quite a distraction nonetheless. I like HHV and have stayed there before but will not return until there are zero updates going on.

<Content>Conrad would be disappointed I travel weekly with my business and as a result stay in many different hotels across the country. I have always judged the hotels by their customer service and I must admit HHV rates near the bottom of my list. The people I came in contact with (especially at the front desk during check-in) were incredibly lazy and made me feel like they were doing me a favor by simply speaking to me. I stayed there for 4 nights: 3 were billed to my credit card and the last night was from my points. By the way I am a Hilton Diamond member. It took the better part of 20 minutes to convince the clerk that I was NOT going to change rooms after 3 nights and that she should do whatever she needed to do to ensure I had the same room throughout my stay. I have combined reward points many times in the past and have never had any problems staying in the same room. I was also disappointed that the staff was not very helpful with dinner recommendations, activities, or even directions. I asked severalstaff members and it was like the entire place just started working there. I truly felt that they simply didn't care about my needs. Granted I am from the mainland, but they should realize that they have their job BECAUSE OF, not IN SPITE OF the tourists. Remember HHV, we don't complain, we just NEVER return. I don't think Conrad Hilton had this in mind when he built the HHV.

<Content>OK Hotel....But Not For Me Stayed at the HHV for 6 days in October. Moved from the Moana Surfrider. Liked the Moana better, although both offered different things, so it depends on what your looking for in a hotel.The HHV is at the end of the strip, so it's about a 10-minute walk to the Shopping District of Waikiki. You can cut through the park located across the street to get to the shopping district faster.Upon check in, there was no line (luckily) but the check in staff was unfriendly, no smiles, and had no answers about their own hotel! I found the concierge was more informative ( friendly), which astounds me because the check-in staff sees more people than the concierge. But, I digress.........The Super pool is bigger than any other on Waikiki, but I have seen bigger pools on other islands. But, for Waikiki, the pool was great. The beach is the biggest on Waikiki also. But, they charge $50-$60.00 for two beach chairs and an umbrella. Moana's are free to guests staying at their hotel. The staff at the restaurants and bars are also unfriendly. Housekeeping said, Good Morning every time we saw them.We stayed in the Rainbow Tower, ocean view. Nice, typical room. Needs updating, but suited me. Tiles in bathroom had somel mold spots, but nothing to complain to mgmt about. I think you're paying more for the beautiful grounds, than for your room. The grounds of the HHV are absolutely beautiful, with Coi Ponds, Pine Trees, talking parrotts, waterfalls, etc. Gorgeous!The air conditioning in your room will NOT stay on if the sliding glass door to go onto your balcony is left open. There is a sensor that shuts the A/C off upon opening. So, no listening to those waves crashing at night.The pool is open til 10pm. Warm enough to swim until then too! The beach has a spot-light on it, so swimming in the ocean at night is also possible. There are no waves, and the waters are very calm on their side. The Moana has a VERY small beach, and its very crowded. But....there are many waves, which I like. Who doesnt want to swim out and ride a wave into shore? But, if you have kids, the HHV has a much calmer, bigger beach. The HHV also had lots of entertainment. Singers come on usualy around 4-5pm, and sing near the 3-bar areas typically til around 10-11pm. The music is just OK, but its something to listen too while your drinking your Mai Tai.Would I stay here again? Maybe....but as a 2nd choice only.

<Content>You'd be impressed My wife  I stayed at the HHV 2 wks ago. We are owners @ a Hilton Grand Vacation Club property in Orlando  traded points for 7 days at the HHV resort, staying in the Kalia Tower. The HHV is a 22-acre resort with about every amenity you can think of. Our unit had a huge living/dining room, full kitchen, nice size bath, large king bdrm, and 2 lanai balconies. The HHV is on the north end of Waikiki, in my opinion the best part of Waikiki beach, certainly the widest beach. Waikiki Beach gets pretty narrow farther south where other hotel complexes are situated. HHV offers beach/pool towels free, free poolside chairs, but you have to pay for renting lounge chairs  umbrellas for the beach. ($15 for lounge chair for a day) HHV has numerous restaurants, bars (including 2 beach/pool side), lots of shops, even an ABC Store onsite. Don't be concerned that you are not in the center of Waikiki beach, as we walked the length of the beach with no problem one morning, and walked parts of it more than once. I guess it to be about 1-1/2 miles in length from one end to the other.  Parking is expensive so we opted not to rent a car; figured we'd spend most of the week around Waikiki. Did rent a car one day at the Hertz kiosk in the Tapa Tower (one of the 4 or 5 towers in the HHV complex, also just a short walk from the Kalia Tower). I don't think it was overly expensive (about $95 for the day for a Mustang convertible) considering we were in a resort  on vacation  we didn't have the high parking fees for a week rental. Drove the island  had a blast. We also took bus to Paradise Cove one evening for their luau. There are trolleys  city buses to get around. The best deal was hopping on board the FREE trolley offered by Hilo Hatties. Although its primary intent was to take you to their store (beyond Ala Moana shopping center), it ran pretty much the length of Waikiki beach and past many of the other Waikiki shopping  eating districts, and you could jump on  off when you pleased. (The day we left HI, though, I read that Hilo Hattie's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, so they may be discontinuing their free trolley, but it's worth checking out if you go.) Food in HI is expensive, even if you buy it and cook yourself. If you were local, maybe you would know the cheaper stores, but groceries in stores near Waikiki is expensive. We generally ate 1 meal a day at restaurants in HHV as well as in other places on the beach, and it was costly, but what the heck, it was vacation! For a cheaper alternative check out local places. We ate once at a place across the street from the HHV, a local diner-type place, (Wahaini's or something like that?)  it was good food. We also had lunch at Giovanni's on the north shore, excellent shrimp, but don't get turned off by the looks of the place. It's a white box truck type like you'd see at a county fair. But a local couple recommended it to us and it was very good.Some comments say they heard lots of noise as the newest HHV tower is being built, but we didn't, but then it is almost complete. The only negatives I can think of for HHV is that our particular lanai, although we had two of them, were quite small, crowded if you put both lanai chairs on them. I think the check-in/out staff could have been friendlier, but they were quite efficient, as we had our room key within 2-3 minutes of arrival. The lounge chairs around the main pool were a bit crowded.Plusses, besides all the shopping  dining options included: the very friendly and helpful concierge desk, the beautiful property landscaping with lots of water falls and decorative ponds, choice of several pools, very responsive housekeeping staff, being right on the beach, quiet solitude of the HHV lagoon, and the proximity to all the things inside the HHV. I'd recommend HHV to anyone.

<Content>Heavy Construction Work We stayed at this hotel for 3 days at the beginning of October. We had booked it through NWA Lifestyle vacations.We had booked a room at the Ali Tower which is suppose to be the Executive floor of all the towers. Unfortunately NWA did not advise us before booking that the hotel (not only the Ali Tower!) is under refurbishment.As soon we checked in and we arrived on our floor (7th floor) we could see that some of the rooms were under refurbishment. The doors were open, the corridor was covered with plastic, furniture was removed etc. Our room was fine and we had a beautiful sea view. Unfortunately the next morning at 9:00 hrs the drilling started which continued until 17:00 hrs in the afternoon. We tried to move rooms but there was no way to escape the noise. We were told that the hotel is changing all the balconies of the Ali Tower which will take approx. 1 year! Even when we suggested moving to another tower, they advised us that there is other work going on at the other towers and we would face the same problem.The hotel itself is very nice. As far as we could see it was the only hotel on Waikiki Beach which had a proper beach. Restaurant facilities where great and it's location was wonderful.I wish we could have stayed at this hotel but unfortunately the construction work was too disturbing. Our tour operator moved us to a new hotel after 3 days.

<Content>Downhill Slide since Blackstone Purchased this Hotel As a Hilton Diamond member who travels frequently for work I spend over 100 days a year in hotel rooms. Most of those nights are at Hilton Properties. I have to tell you that since this hotel was purchased by the Blackstone Group last year, the quality and value of the accommodations has diminished greatly. The perks and room upgrades normally available to Hilton Honors Members are no longer available. Here is a list of things you need to budget if you plan on staying there:-Want to park your car? $29/Day-Want to use the Internet $17/Day-Want a hot breakfast $27 ($11 Diamond Members)-Want to use the workout gym? $20/day-Want a newspaper? Too bad. They are no longer delivered to the rooms are not available on Sundays. -Want to check out a mere one day early after spending three weeks and $4K at the hotel. Nope鈥hat too will also cost you a $100 early departure fee plus tax. The bottom line is鈥he Hilton Hawaiian Village will nickel and dime you to death. This is one of few Hilton's that is solely owned by Blackstone and you can tell by the way it managed. I was treated like a 3rd Class citizen by the Front Desk Manager during my (3) week stay at the Tapa Tower in September.With overall tourism down 15% in Hawaii, there are deals to be had elsewhere. If you are booking a room on Hilton hotel points, I would recommend the Embassy Suites or the Hilton Prince Kuhio. There is one very nice thing about the Hawaiian Village. The pools, entertainment and garden area are great. They are all very enjoyable but you DON鈥漈 need to be a guest to use them. My advice鈥tay somewhere else, grab some cold drinks from the ABC Store (located within the hotel grounds) and enjoy the pools and the entertainment.

<Content>Mixed Bag Stayed at the village from October 4 - 10. Grounds are beautiful, the staff is great, but if at all possible, stay away from the Diamond Head Tower. The rooms are run down. I had to get someone to come in and work on the air conditioning, shower head was falling off, etc.. I was at a conference and had many people tell me that they started in Diamond Head and asked to be moved. I got in too late and was stuck. Upside was, I wasn't in my room that much. Plenty of restaurants to choose from and shopping galore. Just be ready to spend a lot on both. Prices are obviously higher in Hawaii but these prices are high just because of the property. Walk down the street and you will find the same thing for a lot less. Find the ABC store. It will keep you in reasonably prices supplies while you are there. The Roundtable pizza is pricey but worth it. The deli prices will scare you.Rent a car and drive all around the island. If you are going to Pearl Harbor, get up early and be there by 7:15. It gets very busy. Touring the Missouri is well worth it.Knowing that I can get away from the resort dining prices by walking down the street, and if I could be guaranteed that I would not have to stay in the Diamond Head tower again, I would consider returning.

<Content>Extremely Disappointed! We stayed at this hotel for 8 nights in Sep/Oct 08. When we entered the hotel we were very impressed with it. Looks beautiful - lots of beautiful flowers/birds/walkways/facilities etc so we thought we were in for a great stay. But when we got to our room we were extremely disappointed. There were 4 of us - 2 adults and 2 young children. The room was tiny (this was a suite with 2 double beds). The bathroom was disgusting and so small you could only fit one person in it. The room looked as though it had not been updated since the hotel commenced operation. There were no coffee making facilities, no glasses, no room service menu, no brochures of things to do in Oahu. This was the Diamond Head Tower and we did have a fairly nice view - that was the only good thing about the room.The staff at the hotel were very unfriendly and not helpful at all. Because the hotel is so large, staff members seemed to know only about their particular area and were not very knowlegable about the whole hotel. We had spent the previous week on The Big Island and the difference in the service and atmosphere of these two islands was astounding. I would never go back to Oahu and never stay at this hotel again.The one saving grace it had was plenty of shops downstairs and nice grounds. But the beach had shells/rocks on the bottom which was very disappointing.

<Content>fabolous stay My husband and I booked 5 nts at HHV through hotwire(which we've never used before)and were extremely pleased.Upon arrival we were upgraded to an oceanview room in the Kalia tower.Although it's the farthest tower from the beach,it has an excercise facilty,starbucks and did'nt see any children coming or going.We've traveled around the world staying at 5 star resorts,and decided for a wedding we attended to try something out of our comfort zone.The pool areas are great,and the stretch of beach although crowded,does'nt have a billion tourists walking through.We did'nt eat on the property as there are many other fabulous restaurants in the area.Roy's offers a great meal.The mais tais at the pool or bars there are fabulous.Our room was spic and span.Loved our time and can without a doubt reccommend it.

<Content>Overpriced and in Need of Refurbishing We stayed at the HHV for 5 nights to celebrate our 10th anniversay - we were booked into the Ali'i Tower originally at the AAA rate for $300/night plus taxes (about $35/night). This is supposedly their elite tower with extras - however, it was anything but. The room was very worn and shabby, stained carpet, torn wallpaper, grimy bathroom tile - and our partial ocean view could only be seen from the edge of the balcony. When I spoke to one of the managers, I was told that this was a standard and aceptable description. I was offered another room with a better view for an extra $40/night, but when I inspected it, it was in the same deteriorating condition as the first.We accepted the room and then I called the front desk that evening to request a change to the Kalia Tower - according to their website, an oceanview room was available for a AAA rate of only $220. The manager changed our reservations (without the $100 cancelation/change fee the first manager insisted I would have to pay) and the next day we were thrilled to move to a beautiful room (and building - all apparently recently rennovated) with a full ocean view. I highly recommend this tower if you are going to stay at the HHV.We will not return however - overall it was not a very enjoyable experience. The price of food was ridiculous - $9 for a mango smoothie - only 12oz! The Italian restaurant onsite was unbelievable - we ordered an entree of veal scallopine that the menu says will feed 2 or more - when we saw it we burst out laughing. It was one very small pice of veal - no more than 2 or 3 oz - that had been cut into 4 very tiny pieces - nothing with it - and the cost was $32! The waiter felt sorry for us - this was our big anniversary dinner - and brought us a plate of really good pasta, thankfully. Our advice is to eat offsite - The Hulu Grill was wonderful with tables overlooking the beach - and the Top of Waikiki revolving restaurant was one of the best places we have eaten anywhere! The prices at each restaurant were reasonable for Hawaii, the portions ample, and the food fresh and fabulous - and both were Hawaii casual in dress.Most importantly, the staff at the HHW was indifferent for the most part. There was no attempt to make the guests feel welcome or special - when we first checked in, I mentioned that this was a very special anniversary for us, and the desk manager (who was helping out with the long line) said Everyone says that - I guess all of you think that's the way to get an upgrade. I said that's not why I had said that - but then asked if there were upgrades available for HHonors members - he looked at my card and laughed and said - You're only Blue - that's very common and not worth much. Hard to believe this person was a HIlton management representative - BUT, after speaking with a few Honolulu locals, we learned that the HHV had been sold to an investment group by the Hilton Family last year, and that they just lease the name. They said that many of the senior managers had been fired and other staff reduced - and that there was a cost cutting program in place. This was readily apparent - the enitre Village was showing its wear and the prices were much too high for the value. The Village was such a disappointment - unlike our 5 night stay at the HIlton Waikiki Prince Kuhio - see our review for that terrific hotel!

<Content>Fabulous Hawaii We have just returned and I couldnt wait to sing the praises of the Hilton Hawaiian Village, wasnt sure what to expect as had read a few reviews before we left. We decided to judge it for ourselves and we were delighted with what we found. It really is like a small town on the beach, if money is no object you dont need to leave the place!! The grounds are lovely with a selection of birds,even penguins! The restaurants on sight are very good but a little expensive. It was our anniversary so we booked the Bali by the Sea and the atmosphere and the food were excellent.We ate at the Japanese restaurant a couple of times that was good too and more reasonably priced. Being British its the tipping thing that can be abit tiresome. The hotel is a short stroll to the main shopping centre of waikiki with many restaurants and bars to choose from. We had our breakfast at the IHOP most days, bought sandwiches from the ABC onsite for a picnic lunch on the beach and mostly went down town for dinner. Our favourite was just across the road from our tower(Kalia) called 'Singha Thai' we loved it and there was even some Thai dancers to watch while you enjoyed your dinner. The rooms are well appointed and have a fridge so you can stock up on your favourite tipple and there was an icemachine(Free) in the hallway. Would definately go back if given the chance. There was abit of building work going on but it didnt bother us at all.

<Content>nice surroundings but hotel far too big. we arrived at night and was dropped off outside by our bus. we had to ask 2 people where reception was. this place is a maze of shops! our room was very big and we had a lovely big bed, the only downside was that the aircon was a bit noisy. it overlooked the garden area and chapel, which seemed to have a conveyer belt of couples going through it!!! but was a lovely view. the maid dervice was very good, we had a smelly shower curtain, but as soon as we complained they were changing it within the hour. there is a safe in the room, but the hotel charge you for using it, so you have to use the hotel safety deposit boxes, which are free, but its a pain not having all your money etc nearby!!!we only ate at the hotel once, breakfast on our first day. DONT DO IT. food was great, but so expensive. there are so many places on the hotel doorstep that do breakfast, lunch or dinner, sometimes all 3!!!! you will save yourself so much money. pools are lovely, no complaints there, and you are entitled to beach or pool towels which is good.the beach is lovely, all be it shipped in from molokai!!!!! the sunbeds are a rip off to hire everyday, we bought 2 lilo's for $4 and used them instead!!!we did a few trips on this island and would highly reccomend hanauma bay for snorkelling and the north shore shark adventures for an excellent shark cage experience. i was not scared for one second and had the best time.i would also reccomend hiring a car whilst here, we didn't and although we got around very easily and cheaply on The Bus, we couldn't really go and explore the hidden gems of the island.

<Content>Best pool and beach frontage in Honolulu Spent 5 nights at the Hilton and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. There are 2 public pools and although I was there during the schoold holidays, didnt have to battle for a deck chair in the morning. The beach frontage is excellent and the hotel is an easy 10min walk in to the central shops and 10min walk to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre. I would certainly return to this hotel again, though I would try to avoid school holidays!I didnt eat in the hotel but ate at Ala Moana a couple of times (they have several restaurant options) and The Cheesecake Factory in the centre is certainly the most popular option for tourists (but warning..everything comes in LARGE size so you can easily share everything with 2 people!)

<Content>Paradise at it's best! We arrived Sept 19 for a 4 night stay after travelling throughout Alaska and Florida for a few weeks, on our way home to Australia.This was our 3rd stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and it will not be our last.We had originally booked a City View room in the Kalia Tower, on our arrival at 4pm in the afternoon at the resort we arrived at the Kalia Tower to check in, there was no waiting at all. The delightful clerk advised us as we had been there already a few times before that they would like to offer an upgrade to an Ocean View Room in the Rainbow Tower. We arrived to our room a few minutes later to room R1608.It was a lovely and spacious room, with awesome views and a king bed.The check in staff and the bell man was a delight and very friendly and helpful.Infact all the staff we dealt with throughout the resort were friendly and courteous.Many reviewers complain that the resort is too big and too far away from everything and is expensive.Well those who post such negative reviews obviously don' travel much or don't appreciate the spaciousness of the HHV and how being on prime ocean front realestate is a treat.So you have to walk 10 minutes to get to the main strip, so whats wrong with that, a little walk is great to walk off that big dinner etc.Atleast when you stay at the HHV you can't look across from your room and see into other hotels which down on the strip area they are so close together and you have a hike to the beach.HHV is awesome and I will not stay anywhere else when I am in Honolulu.We had no trouble getting a sun lounge around the super pool at any time, the food and cocktails were not expensive at all, infact the cocktails at Tropics were a bargain. $9 for a huge frozen mai tai or lime margarita, it was equal to 3 large drinks and boy it knocked my socks off that I had to go and take a nap.Do yourself a favour and stay at the HHV.

<Content>OK but Pricey!! The Hilton Hawaiian Village is an okay hotel. The rooms were a good size, the decor was a little outdated. A fresh coat of paint and some new furniture would do wonders for the place. For the $$ the hotel charges, I expected it to be a little more updated.The best part of the hotel is the shops within the resort. Easy and convenient for last minute souvenirs. The ABC Store is the best place for breakfast,lunch, snacks  drinks. The hotel food can get pricey. The location of the hotel is great. Its an easy walk to the shopping district and restaurants if you don't want to eat within the hotel complex. There's plenty of buses that stop right in front of the hotel and the beach bus is 2 blocks away. Waikiki Beach is adjacent to the hotel so that was good. Now for the bad, the line to check in was very long. The walk from the bus area to the front desk is about a 10 minute walk. Not fun with luggage and kids.We were at the Alli tower and there is a private pool/fitness area for guests of that tower. No one bothered to mentioned that there is an extra charge to use those amenities. The pool was small for the # of guests the hotel has. There's never lounge chairs open unless you get there early or really late in the afternoon.Renting a beach chair and umbrella for the beach is costly. You're better off getting a beach mat at the ABC store for $2 bucks. Even better,when you check in, the hotel gives you a coupon book, there's a coupon in there for a free beach mat if you spend a certain amount at ABC. Do that and save yourself the $. After your stay, just throw it away.

<Content>Nice, but expensive, expected a little better We went to Honolulu in May for a conference. This hotel was very busy because of the conference. Our first room was on the top floor of the Tapa tower and it was beautiful and spacious. Though it was a little farther from the beach, the view was still lovely. The following morning after we arrived, we noticed our electricity was not functioning properly (the lights would not work at all in the bathroom and worked intermittently in the main part of the room). We called to have the electricity checked and no one came until we called a second time that afternoon. They told us we had to move because it was a major electrical short. They moved us to the rainbow tower, which was closer to the ocean, but the room was not as spacious or as updated. The water barely came out of the shower head and poured into the tub from the faucet part. We decided not to complain because we didn't want to have to repack everything for another move (we had a 2 and 4 year old along). They did send us a cookie plate with about a dozen cookies with an apology card for the trouble of having to move. We didn't really like the second room compared to the first, and when we told them, they did not offer to upgrade for us.From the rave reviews on this site, I expected better customer service. I'm sure our scenario is not the norm, however. Overall it was clean, our second room was a little noisy (for 2 kids), but it really depends what you are looking for (whether you'll be in the room during the day for naps, etc). I think I would not be happy if I had to pay the price and we didn't get reimbursed for our stay because of the conference. I am giving this a 3 as if I did pay, which is more my honest opinion of the experience.

<Content>Mixed feelings about my stay Overall a pleasant stay, but my what a busy place. Lots of families and travelers like ourselves. If you are a people watcher, this is a great place. We checked in after 8pm, so no wait. The clerk was a bit tired and cranky but so were we, since out plane was late. Otherwise, the staff is friendly and they really keep the place clean and neat. You have to get to the pool at 8:30am, opening, to get the place you want. The chaise lounges are comfortable, but jammed together. Seems since they took out the pool at one of the towers, the super pool gets a whole lot more use. I noticed the table we used each day was never cleaned. Same ketchup stain there for a week, which I thought odd, since there are cleaning people everywhere. The room was pleasant and the beds comfortable. The beach is excellent but the rental for 2 lounges and an umbrella cost $60 a day. THAT IS MORE THAN MY MORTGAGE PAYMENT. Also, unless you are going to be renting beach toys everyday and visiting the Spa daily, DO NOT BUY THE PARADISE PASS. That is the biggest rip off yet. We bought it and really lost money for sure. Also, one sheet says Mai Tais on day of arrival only but the one you get to use each day, says Mai Tais on ....any day. Not a big thing but should be consistent in their message.

<Content>Great Resort Some of the previous reviews need to be put into perspective. HHV is a very clean, well laid out resort with over 90 shops, several restaurants, and a very convinient ABC store on the premises with very resonable prices for anything from milk to snacks and sandwiches and a very good variety of alcoholic beverages. There are many ways to avoid the high priced restaurants. Some of the restaruants have good prices or early bird specials. If you can't find one in your budget, there are many within walking distance in front of the hotel. Some priced lower, some not. That said, I find it amazing how some dwell on the avoidable negatives. It's a resort on the very best real estate on Waikiki Beach, For that, a premium is deserved. Overall, we found the resort very well run and a bit like disneyland in the respect it felt majical in its intesting and detailed design of its shopping areas. Checking in was not a problem. There are other options for checking in such as their self-help kiosk, a line just for HiltonHonors members, and even online check-in and self-help kisoks at the airport. So those that complain about long waits, are obviously in need of getting with the times. We checked in the HH line and waited maybe 5 minutes. It was a breeze. The room we received for a $40 a night upgrade charge was a beachfront rainbow tower room. It was the best! Lucky for us it wasn't crowded. The views were incredible. HHV has the best beach as it is much deeper and far less crowded then near the Duke statue resorts further down. It's an easy walk to downtown Waikiki either on the beach or off and in my opinion located in the best area close to vast parks and lots of shops and restaurants. This resort is well worth the price of the rooms. Yes, the food and drink can be expensive, but it's there for those that want it, or as I stated, there are options to save if you aren't lazy and walk over to their ABC store. You can get a throw away ice chest and load up for the beach on the cheap. The employees were pleasant and there is a good vibe about the place. We went in Sept, and it was slow compared to the summer months and that makes for a more pleasant experience. In a nutshell, if you want premium real estate on the beach, this place has it and for that expect to spend some money or stay off the beach in a cheaper hotel and walk hundreds of yards to the beach. We felt the rates were in line for one of the most visited areas in the world on the most famous beach in the world. No complaints here.

<Content>Tourist Trap What a waste of money for awful service. I booked my wedding here - The coordinator was unreachable at the best of times and I'm not even sure what she did in the end. The staff were totally clueless about everything - and also patched me through to the wrong extensions on more then one occasion.The wedding itself - let's see - the minister was awesome, the photographer was awesome... That's it. No chairs, no alter - we signed our marriage license on a binder...The room was small and overpriced. The safe cost money - the internet cost money - room service was insanely overpriced - even for room service. Read the fine print. It cost 1.50 to receive phone calls, even room to room.They told us they upgraded us to a honeymoon sweet - which they did not. I guess they forgot they said that?They like you to also arrive on your first night through the service door area because they don't like the buses (even the little ones) to come near the front door. (So after a six hour flight we got to haul our bags - no bell service here - from the back of the hotel at 1 am to the front - a good ten minute walk)There was ONE good restaurant in the whole area - if you walk out to the main street you can find better food without the resort price. I have been to Honolulu many times. I have stayed in crap hotels, and received far better service, free safes, free incoming calls, free internet, and breakfast. All within a walk to the beach.I guess I took away two good things - the layout was very pretty - but its hard to mess that up in Hawaii. And the Bali by the Sea restaurant gave me an EXCELLENT experience. That is all.

<Content>It certainly is a village! Six hotel towers with it's own little community of shopping and restaurants, and several swimming pools. We waited over an hour just to check in -- even on the Hilton Honors line! Due to a problem we experienced at another Hilton hotel in Napa, CA, we got a sweet upgrade to a 1-bedroom suite in the Tapa Tower. The lady at the reservations desk said this room typically goes for $1k+ per night. The view was great -- we had 2 lanais on the 15th floor with an amazing 180 degree view of the ocean and part of city. They provided Crabtree  Evelyn toiletries which was nice. The space was huge with a living room area, dining area, wet bar, large bedroom, 1-1/2 baths. Unfortunately, the suite is old and rundown, and can use some major redecorating. Honestly, I wouldn't have paid good money for this suite. The resort itself is beautiful. But lots of children! The beach entry was very rocky so we found ourselves making our way south toward's Duke 's where the sand was nice and soft. And oh, one celebrity sighting -- we saw Tony Soprano in the hotel lobby (James Gandolfini). Self parking is $24; Valet is $29.During our 2007 visit, we stayed at the Waikiki Marriott Resort which for us was definitely a more comfortable stay.Suggestions for delicious meals: Blue White Shrimp truck on Kuhio Rd., Side Street Inn, Ono Hawaiian Food and Fresh Kahuku Shrimp over at North Shore

<Content>Loved it but don't walk back from downtown late at night! Stayed 6 nights in the Tapa tower with our two early twenties sons (2 rooms). Ours had an ocean view that was just beautiful and room itself very large. Beach was fabulous - food average. Our trip was upsetting as one night (late) my sons were walking back to the hotel from the main downtown area when they were attacked by a group of local kids right in front of 2 so-called security guards who did nothing. Luckily only a black eye was sustained as my kids ran. I have since heard numerous stories of trouble such as this. I wish I had been warned and I would have had them take a cab and or not be walking so late. Beware!

<Content>Nice enough but lacked a certain something! We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights and for me that was long enough. The rooms themselves were great. We stayed in the Tapa Tower and had masses of space, a large closet and 'kitchen' area and a reasonably small bathroom and balcony just enough for two. It was all clean and serviced daily (although often forgot to restock the coffee/tea!!). The drinks were very expensive from the bars as you would expect I guess. Also, the bars shut quite early at this resort. The beach here is less crowded and wider than further down towards Waikiki proper which is good and the lagoon is a nice addition. The pools were very disappointing. Nothig super about the super pool I'm afriad! I had a bad experience with one of the assistants in the Guest Welcome Centre who failed to answer my question and when I asked her again walked off in the other direction!!Overall, a pleasant enough stay but if I was to go back to Waikiki I would try somewhere else.

<Content>Horrible We booked 2 oceanview rooms. When we arrived, we stood in line 45 minutes at Reservations only to finally be told they had given our rooms to a group that decided to extend their stay. The manager said they'd find us accomodations in another hotel and the Hilton would foot the bill for the entire stay. She lied. Our first nite we stayed in a 2 star hotel with views of a parking lot and a public housing apartment bldg. Rest of stay was in nice hotel but no ocean view. The Hilton charged our credit card for 2 oceanview rooms for 5 nights at the Hilton!!! Each time I called the mgr, she says Oh, yes we're going to issue you the credit!. It's been 4 weeks now and guess what....no credit. Expedia.com sided with the Hilton. Said because we did get accomodations, we should pay. We didn't ask for a free stay, the mgr volunteered it. Additionally, we were charged for oceanview, but didn't get it. Expedia won't post my review on their site. They only post the great ones, apparently. You don't get the truth when dealing with the .com agents.

<Content>Good! My husband and I went per 4 days.He had a conference and we were really disappointed about the distance between the hotel and the Conference Center (they said it was close! ).However the place is gorgeous, there are a lot of shops and restaurant..I loved the one on the beach..(good simple pizza!!).They give you free towel and there is the possibility to rent everything you can need on the beach..The sea in front of the hotel is great and warm.The room was really clean, big and with the security box. There is also a very nice staff: I left my i-pod inside the security box, and, after 3 days from the check out, I call the hotel and they found it and give it back!..Very nice!The hula lesson is nice, but to do just once.

<Content>What a wonderful place!! Since we are Hilton Diamond Members, we earned enough points to stay 7 nights 8 days. This is a huge hotel. They have about 3,000 rooms in 5 towers and were completely sold out the week we were there. As we arrived, check in was quick. The parking is in its own structure, so drop the luggage off at the front desk unless you like hauling luggage. It is a long walk from the parking garage to the room carrying a lot of luggage. The parking garage is located next to the shops in the middle of the Hilton Village. Parking was pricey, $29 for valet and $24 for self parking per night, but I think all the hotels are in the same price range for parking. We were upgraded to the Rainbow Tower with an Ocean Front and Lagoon view. The view was beautiful. The room is a little dated, but nice and clean and a good size. The bed was super comfy. It had a little refrigerator for drinks that you can pick up at the ABC store. My only complaint was the shower. The shower pressure was horrible. They have low flow shower heads. We had relatives stay in the Tapa Tower and the room was nice, the building is newer than the Rainbow Tower and they did not have a problem with the shower. The 鈥淪uper鈥?pool is big and perfect for kids. They also have a kid鈥檚 pool next to the super pool. The pool is open from 8:30 a.m. 鈥?10 p.m., which I didn鈥檛 understand why they didn鈥檛 open up earlier. They did have lifeguards for the pools. If you want a seat, get there around 8:20 and wait to put your stuff down, or you鈥檒l be waiting for people to leave. The grounds were beautiful. Make sure to visit the penguins鈥?exhibit. They also have exotic birds on the grounds and flamingos. You always saw someone cleaning or walking the grounds, so if you needed anything, someone was always there to ask. We ate at the Rainbow Lanai for breakfast and they were fast. We had complimentary continental breakfasts, but upgraded our breakfast for $10. Good deal. We also ate at the All you can eat crab dinner. We were disappointed in the buffet. They show Alaskan crab on the picture, but they only had snow crab. So check the buffet out first to see if it is worth the money. We ate at the Kobe restaurant within walking distance from the hotel and that was good, my son who is 4 actually was entertained by the chefs, but didn鈥檛 eat much. He kept asking me where the bacon was in his fried rice. I guess he is used to our cooking?After walking around the grounds, I can see why they call it the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It has everything you need, but we did venture off to try different things. We went parasailing up in Hawaii Kai with Sea Breeze Water sports and it was great 鈥?we had friends that had a Entertainment guide so it cost us about $67 for the 2 of us! We also tried the Hawaiian Waters Adventure Park and it was great for the kids. Get the tickets at Costco $25 for adults and $18 for kids. Oh and if you like to try new things, try Giovanni鈥檚 shrimp truck up in Kahuku. Yummy! $12 a plate - Bring wet naps and a sharpie if you can鈥?There was a long line, but Oh so worth it! We had the shrimp scampi and my son had the garlic hotdog that was dipped it in the garlic oil and it was gone within minutes. Matsimoto鈥檚 is good too up in Hale鈥檌wa, if you like shaved ice. There is a long line, but definitely worth it. The cost is only $2.00 for a large shave ice, more if you want to add extra items. We all shared one and it was good.I have to say for a free stay, it was well worth it! We didn鈥檛 go to any timeshare meetings or introductions, we actually just vacationed! What a nice thing to be able to do in such a beautiful place鈥?The only regret, we didn鈥檛 stay longer.

<Content>Liked the Ali'i tower and the resort We had booked the Ali'i tower after reading reviews on TA. Fortunately we checked the rates a week or so before leaving and were able to secure a better rate than our original booking. We booked a partial ocean view and a garden view for the week. When we checked in our rooms were not ready (not what you want to hear after 20 hours travelling) but they did not take long and we were given adjoining rooms (both partial ocean views) which overlooked the main pool area and the Friday night entertainment. The check in lady was very nice and other than checking out we had very little interaction with staff, who seemed pleasant and accomodating. I had a problem signing up with the in room internet and we ended up getting charged twice but that was sorted prior to check out. We were not aware of where there were any evening hors d'hoevres and did not need or get the turn down service but that was fine. The hotel complex is large but not that overpriced for getting snacks or souvenirs (ABC store and Whalers are fine for this). There is plenty on the site that you don't need to leave but we did venture out on several occasions. Taxis are readily available from the main lobby and I found them cheaper than those outside the hotel. Hertz booth was handy but very busy even at 6.20am!The fireworks was spectacular on Friday night.We ate breakfast most days at Wailana coffee House across the road, which was the same price for full breakfast as the coffees from Starbucks and a croissant. The Ali'i pool was a good plus as it was small and intimate. We used the gym too, which is situated next to the pool. We asked if there was self service laundry facilities in the complex but were told that we could use the laundry bags but they were overpriced for doing a whole weeks clothes so we went along to the laundry on Ena Road and were around $25 to have this done for us and ready in 4 hours to collect. We paid for 1 shirt to be dry cleaned at the hotel and it cost $9.50 and took a day and a half to return to us.The Outback and Red Lobster are a very short walk as is Tony Roma's in the other direction. You can walk to the shops at Alana Moana. There is a Bubba Gumps there to eat as well.One thing that I noticed about Hawaii was how clean and tidy everything was compared to most places I have visited. Tourism this year was a bit down according to those we spoke to.We thought the grounds were very pretty and we would certainly recommend it to others.

<Content>nice beachfront location and propery, but amenities way overpriced RAINBOW TOWER - Great location. Tower is closest one to the pool and beach. Room was typical size with small counter and refrigerator and safe. Clean and comfortable beds, but they are only doubles and not queens. Rooms appeared recently refurbished. The worst part was the elevators. Only five elevators in this tower and the wait can be 10+ mins for one to come (especially going down in the morning or before dinner). In the lobby there were many times when there were 50-60 people waiting.Originally booked with Hilton Honors points into a Garden View Tapa Tower room but upgraded on check in to a Ocean Front Rainbow Tower room with a view of the beach and Diamond Head. Staff at other Waikiki hotels much better - everyone here seemed as if you were bothering them.GROUNDS - The grounds were well maintained with lots of shopping and animals to see. On site restaurants were way overpriced and not very good, with the exception of Benihana. There are not too many dining options within walking distance that is any good. Coupon book that the front desk gives out saved a little. Walking to the heart of Waikiki (International Marketplace and the surrounding areas) is quite a long walk in the hot sun. If you want to leave the village, plan on walking a lot. ABC Store is on the property, which I didn't know in advance. Save money there instead of buying everything overpriced through Hilton.POOL - Hard to find seating anytime after 9am or before 5pm. Especially if you need more than 2-3 lounges together. You would expect a larger pool for such a huge resort.BEACH - The beach is great with gentle waves. Hotel guests can rent a umbrella and two lounge chairs for something like $60. Tube rental was $10 or you can go to the ABC Store at the hotel and buy one for $3. Not very crowded compared to other beaches at Waikiki. Towels are free.ACTIVITES - If you don't book the lei making, hula lessons, or other family activities as soon as they make the sign up sheet available, you will be out of luck.CHECKIN - Very very very slow. Hilton Honors line was no better.TRANSPORTATION - $34 taxi van to the airport. Concierge recommended that over the $9 shuttle service they normally recommend that takes way longer.

<Content>Love it and hate it We had two rooms for 10 nights with our family of four (kids 19 and 21). The hotel is a machine...but a well run machine. If the guests all disappeared, it would take the staff several days to notice. There is no sense of hospitality or personal attention, but you can't expect it in a resort of this size. The elevators in the Rainbow Tower will drive you crazy - they need about 3 more. Your younger kids will love the place. There are a lot of good reasons to stay here, but if you are looking for serenity or relaxation, forget it.

<Content>Large, but Lovely We booked our stay at the Hilton through the Hilton Honors Program. 1 of our nights was free. The other nights were about $200 each. We were in the Kalia tower which is closest to the road, but newly renovated. Our room was clean and well appointed with a king size bed and a sitting area with a loveseat that pulled out into a twin bed. Our view was lovely we could see the ocean and what I guess you might call downtown Honolulu. The Spa was in our building so we had a pool in our building on the 4th floor by the spa, but it was really cold. The super pool was a bit of a hike. Our building also had its own check in and concierge which is nice. I liked this resort because the location is excellent. There was a Starbucks in our building. Benihana was 10ft away, and if you don't want to eat ridiculously priced food you can walk across the street to the Wailana Coffe House. The breakfast there is excellent and the other meals are fine. A solid alternative to eating $50+ meals everynight. Around the corner from the Coffee House was Eggs n Things which also had a fantastic breakfast..The Hilton is also close to the shops and Marketplace. Honestly after driving around Wakiki I thought we had one of the best locations on the beach. If I come back to Honolulu I will most definitely stay here again.I've heard some people complain that the resort is too large, but I tend to like mega resorts and I thought everything was super convenient here. I actually found our resort in Maui to be more spread out and more crowded.

<Content>This was a very nice resort I am a diamond member and have stayed at many Hilton properties over the last 10 years, and I find it hard to believe some people say negative things about this resort. It is not as luxurious as the Hilton Cabo or Cancun, but it is very nice.I stayed for 6 nights on a Hilton GLON award (7-24-08). I was upgraded to the rainbow tower room 2113. It had 2 balconies that overlooked the ocean and diamond head. We could watch the fireworks from our room! The room was twice the normal size with 2 bathrooms and a King bed with a sleeper sofa. There was not a divider in the room. The bed was great and the room was clean. It had a small wet bar and a small refrig. I received free continental breakfast every morning (diamond member perk)for the family of 4. I never upgraded for 10.00/5.00 child. The food was enough to fill you up. The pineapple was great as well as the psuedo krispie kreem donuts. The pool was a little small, but not overcrowded. Lots of shade. The beach was very nice, but the chairs and umbrellas are a rip off. The lagoon is nice, but never swam in it. The resort is very nice looking with lots of animals all over the place. Make sure you see the penguins! Ate dinner at the steak house using an entertainment card (28.00 value). It was good. Walked to the cheesecake factory. Got right in if you go for an early dinner. ABC store on location has ok sandwiches and decent prices on all kinds of things like pop and water. Much cheaper than expected. It did not feel too crowded and I was very happy with my stay. All the employees were genuinly nice and friendly. I would go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>Best Fourth of July Fireworks Show Ever While not a hotel I would chose for just my husband and I, the Hilton Hawaiian Village was just the thing for our four children. Pools, flora, fauna, penguins, and, of course, the beach!Service was great, rooms (adjoining) were fine-really like the refrigerators. Prices of food very steep, but if this surprises you than you haven't done your homework. ABC store great for munchies and juices. We flew in July 1 and figured we'd stay on Waikiki for 4th of July and the Fireworks show that we could view from our lagoon view room in the Rainbow Tower was the best that I have seen in my 40 years. Actually got chills!Activities (lei making etc) were non-existent the week we were there-perhaps bc it was 4th of July week. Beach to the left is good, to the right, rocky. Walk a bit to Fort De Russy for more sandy shore.Overall, a very fun time was had by us.

<Content>Pleasant Stay I left my Waikiki Beach hotel to move to the HHV for the last four nights of my stay in Hawaii. I was crestfallen to see how big the place was, but I was soon quite happy with the decision. I went to check in quite early, hoping they would have a room at 9 a.m. so I could move my luggage from the other hotel. I was surprised to find they did have a room! I moved into the Kahlia Tower (sp?) where I enjoyed a lovely view of the mountains and the park below. The room was really beautiful- lovely dark wook furnishings, quality linens. The bathroom also appeared to be recently refurbished. I was a little disappointed to hear street traffic from my balcony, but it was not loud enough to bother me at night. Kahlia Tower had its own lobby with checkout desk, porters, a Starbucks, and a fitness room. I am sure there were other amenities I've forgotten. There were far more Japanese in the hotel than you can imagine- I heard more Japanese than English. Everyone was polite and tolerant of language differences.As large as the HHV was, it was not as noisy as Waikiki Beach. The beach itself and the pools were crowded, but remained fairly quiet. I loved the little manmade laguna on the side of the Rainbow Tower. The jogging paths around it were an excellent idea.I was a little surprised to find the toiletries included only shampoo and conditioner, with one bar of soap. I asked for lotion and shower gel but none was left, so they either do not provide them, or were out.The beaches and pools had everything you could possibly need for a day in the sun. There were also plenty of restaurants, of all types, although the prices were high. There was shopping ranging from ABC (convenience) store to Louis Vuitton. There was even a post office in the business center. You would not have to leave HHV if you did not want to- everything you need is there. HHV is an easy walk (10 min) to the Ala Moana Shopping Center, although there is also a bus right out front if you don't feel like walking in the sun. It was a lovely walk across the Ala Wai canal.Because of my own mistake, I had two separate reservations for this hotel, so I ended up moving to Rainbow Tower. I was glad I did as there was absolutely no street noise at all. I had a view of the laguna, the ocean, and the marina. The room was older, and not quite as nicely finished, but still quite nice. This room had a wet bar with a refrigerator- great addition. Making the move was painless- the bell staff took care of luggage for me- I didn't even have to be in the room to accept it.I highly recommend this hotel because of its location. It is an easy walk/bus/trolley ride to the center of the Waikiki Beach activitiy, without the street noise. Although it is HUGE, service is clearly stressed and I felt well taken care of.

<Content>Beautiful location but some facilites not as good as they used to be Having enjoyed our time at this location so much a number of years ago, we decided to return for a one week stay. This time we were disappointed to see that some things were not as luxurious. Although set in a beautiful location, The hotel doesn't seem quite as luxurious as it used to be. However, the staff were fantastic. Only informed that the Ali Tower was having building work done when we checked in and were assigned a room on top of a building site. It would have been nice if they had sent an e-mail to inform guests before they arrive.Staff were very good and re-assigned us a room when we spoke with them. The rooms are a lovely size, and very clean but in need of redecoration. Little luxuries such as slippers were nowhere to be found and a chocolate on the pillow (as they advertise) did not exist until the last night,. There was no evidence of turndown service.The pool in the Ali Tower was lovely, but a limited number of parasols.  The are a variety of restuarants on site. All are expensive but the quality of food and service at Bali by The Sea, and the Italian Restaurant are great. We also visited the Steak House, but would not recommend it. Food was expensive, but of a very poor quality and service was no where near as good as that offered in the other restaurants. Although expensive, the breakfast at the Rainbow Tower was wonderful and the staff were very friendly. There are a range of shops, so no need to wander too far and having the beach so close is a definite bonus.The taxi service they recommend for collection from the airport was great. Very punctual and offered lots of information about the local area

<Content>Loved this hotel Stayed at this hotel for a week in May 2007 after our cruise around Hawaii. We stayed in the Ali Tower which is fab, you have a separate pool for this part of the hotel on the roof overlooking the main pools. We enjoyed the nibbles before dinner (from 5 pm - 7 pm for Ali Tower guests only). Our room was lovely and clean, spacious and maids would leave flowers and chocolates each evening on your pillow. Staff are lovely and you're greeted with a garland!Hotel is amazing - lots of little shops to wander to. You walk out of the hotel and you are on Waikiki beach - which is fab. I would recommend this hotel to anybody. Hawaii is absolutely gorgeous and this is the perfect place to stay. The cruise was amazing too, great way to see all the islands. We hired a car for the week we stayed in the hotel, but to be honest you don't really need it - maybe one or two days if you want to travel out.

<Content>Blue Hawaii fun in the sun! I had read so many reviews about this property - so many unhappy people saying it wasnt worth it - but I can say all the bad are totally set aside once you sit by the pool and soak in the sun!Same deal as everyone else - wrong room at check in - but we refused what was given and had it amended. Loved our Hilton Honors membership as it got us free breakfast daily which was continental only and although basic could be upgraded to hot meals. Had a high room in the Rainbow Tower building with Diamond Head View which I booked and paid extra in advance to secure. Was worth the $$ as nothing like waking up in the morning and looking out at the beautiful scenery. I would sit out there and read my book while waiting for the rest to wake up. Rooms are tired but are fine and clean. Bathroom could do with a revamp. The services at the hotel are amazing! You dont need to venture far for anything as everything is there. The beach is gorgeous - only hotel with such a large beachfront in Waikiki. There was so much activity for the kids - hula dancing - ukelele lessons - lei making - they had a ball. We bought some sand toys and off they went. Rented paddle cycles which they had fun on in the lagoon. Evening entertainment by the pool every night. Dont feel you need to buy the big Friday night show package. You can see it for free by standing behind the ropes. We bought the seat with the cocktail - but would have been just as happy seeing it from another position. could have also watched the show from our room balcony. Fireworks made it special!The animal life is also amazing. They have penguins!! The village shops are great - lunch by the pool fun - dinners were average. Great bookstore - also a second hand one. Suggest reading something written by a local. There is always something to see or do - or just relax by the pool. Was a much needed rest after a long trip on the mainland. I highly recommend it for some serious RR - especially for families. We will be back!

<Content>Ok but nothing to write home about We might have been spoiled by the Four Seasons in Maui. When we island hopped to Oahu we stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian. There were ALOT of people which made checking in long and crowded. We stayed on the 26th floor with a nice city/ocean view. The room size was smaller compared to Four Seasons and the Waikiki Prince but clean. Our stay was overall average. I'd like to try a different hotel on our next visit to Waikiki.

<Content>Overhyped in Waikiki I stayed at the HHV for 8 nights from July 19th to July 26th. My wife , two kids, ages 7 and 9 stayed in the Ali'i tower. I picked this tower b/c it seemed like it had the best amenities, and on this count I think it did.A number of people have noted the lines at check in. I can attest that I saw lines of weary travelers at times from 11pm to 8AM. The Ali'i tower has its own check in so I did not have to deal with this. One suggestion is to sign up for the Hilton Honers program, as there is this is free and there is a seperate, MUCH shorter line for check in.As to the room, it was of good size and we looked out over the courtyard/pool, with an ocean view looking over the railing. The room was of above average size, and there was a mini fridge and two sinks/vanities. The bedding was above average. One quirk was that though they no longer have a mini-bar, the cabinet for the minibar acts as a stand for the coffee maker, but we could have used an actual cabinet for more storage. Facing the pool, I was subjected to the evening entertainment from the Tapa bar. Most nights they had a lounge act playing till 1100. Now normally I stay up later than this, but if you want to go to sleep to get up early to do something, the music may keep you up. It did for me. Also complaining to the management (twice) did not elicit any help.The Ali'i tower has its own pool and hot tub on the 2nd floor and a happy hour with some free appetizers from 5-7pm. This was a nice amenity.As to the resort as a whole, the Ali'i tower and Rainbow tower are the closest to the beach if this is important to you. I found this very convenient. My family and I snorkled and swam at thie beach on several occasions and there was a small amount of fish near the dock. Towels are free, but as noted by some, chair rentals are 15 each and umbrellas are 20 or 25 dollars I believe.We did not use the main pool that much, but it is quite spacious. Towels and chairs were plentiful. I think the key is not to be afraid to ask if someone has abandoned their towels and saved the chairs the whole day and remove them.The village is designed to keep you on property. There is nothing wrong with this, but things arent cheap. Breakfast for a family of 4 can easily run 50-60 dollars. Meanwhile across the street is a popular breakfast spot, where you can eat for half that amount.Another annoyance I had with the property was parking. 25 dollars a day for self and 29 for valet. Are you kidding me? At least they didn't tack on the ubiquitous resort fee.Don't get me wrong, there is nothing horrible about the hlton. The grounds are well kept. The room I stayed in was clean and well maintained. The pool and beach are clean and easily accessible. It just wasn't that special a place to spend a week in paradise.

<Content>Stay away YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTEDAs a seasoned and well traveled person, I don't mind spending a lot of money on high quailty travel. From the minute my family and I arrived at the resort I wanted to leave. Since check-in is 3 pm and we didn't arrive to the resort until 7:30 pm I didn't expect any problems - WRONG! Our room was not ready until after 10 pm. We didn't get the room catogory or floor level that I requested when I made my reservation 7 months earlier. The staff is rude and unaccomdating. The food is horrible and extremely over-priced. This hotel is a nickle and dime hotel - they charge for everything  it's all expensive- fitness room, business center, in-room safe deposit boxes, beach chairs, etc - be prepared. The beach is ok at best. You will be continually harassed to take a 90 minute tour of the vacation club they are building every time you ask a simple question - when you say no they will look at you like you are crazy. Not for the Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton crowd

<Content>Don't let the pictures fool you! Don't let the pictures fool you! My family checked into this hotel for our four-day vacation stay after waiting in line for almost an hour. When we finally got to our room, we were very disappointed with the old outdated one bedroom suite located in the Diamond Head Tower. It had poorly patched up walls and doors. The bathroom was very small and, the so called kitchen area looked unsanitary with the busted out countertop screen. Moreover, we were even more disgusted the next day after seeing a cock roach crawling along the wall in our suite. We requested a room change, but wasn't able to get one until the next day. Not only did we not rest well after seeing this, but we lost almost a full day of our vacation waiting around the next day for the hotel to place us in another room. Finally, we were placed in a One Room accommodation, but had paid in advance for a One Bedroom Suite. When we asked for an adjustment for the price difference between these two rooms, we were informed by the manager on duty that the second room we were placed in was also a suite, although it didn't have the separate bedroom which we specifically requested in order to comfortably accommodate our family. We have stayed in many hotels over the years, and can't believe that the Hilton sells the second room they placed us in as a suite. While it was nicer and more comfortable than the first room, it was truly just a typical hotel room with a view.In addition, to our issues with the accommodations, the hotel really needs to put more effort into training their staff on customer service skills. Guests pay a lot of money for their vacations and should be appreciated for choosing this hotel over the many other hotels in the area. Instead, we were made to feel at times that we were bothering the staff and/or interrupting them from something more important than their customers. My family and I were really looking forward to our vacation in Hawaii, but we left the Hilton Hawaiin Village feeling unsatisfied, not rested, and frustrated. I apologized to my family for choosing this hotel over all the others...Unfortunately, I let the pictures fool me!!!

<Content>The perfect honeymoon Myself and my wife went to the Hilton Hawaiian Village for our honeymoon.We were greated by a friendly receptionist who upgraded us to a ocean view in the Rainbow tower. Which provided a perfect view of the July the 4th fireworksThe room was perfect with 2 balconies.The resort itself is very big but tastefully done so you do not feel you are in such big surroundings.The beach and lagoon were lovely and relaxing with great views of Waikiki Beach and the harbourAll the staff were friendly and informative giving some good ideas on places to visit and drinks to sample!!We could not fault the resort even when it was busy over the 4th July weekend.We would definetly reccomend the Luao at the hotel and for a nice romantic meal Sergios restaurant

<Content>Nice hotel, but not for honeymooners. Let me preface by saying we came here after spending six fantastic nights at the Westin Maui for our honeymoon, and we found the two resorts to be very different. First, the good:The hotel and the grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The grounds were clean, lots of animals, tons of shops (you can pretty much buy anything you may have forgotten right there on the resort), Lappert's Ice Cream is awesome, too! Our room also had a fantastic view of Diamond Head and the ocean. You can also walk into Waikiki, but since the Hilton is on the end of the beach, some people may think the walk is too long (it's about a 15 minute walk onto the main street, Kalakaua Ave). We didn't mind the walk, but if you don't like walking long distances to shop or get something to eat, you may want to take this into consideration and stay somewhere that's located on Kalakaua like the Moana Surfrider.You can organize any and all activities right there on the resort, too. The concierge and the American Express office can book anything, so that was convenient. They will also recommend activities. We went to Pearl Harbor (a must), walked to the Waikiki Aquarium, and did the Oahu Ghost Tour (cheesy). We also went to Paradise Cove for the luau which was ok--a bit corny in the beginning, but the dancing and singing was great!I can't really comment on the restaurants, since the only one we tried was Tropics right on the beach for lunch. It was ok, nothing special, so don't expect too much.Ok, now the bad: When we arrived on Sunday afternoon, we were irritated to find there was a huge line in the lobby for check in, and not enough people working to move guests along quickly. We waited for about 20-30 minutes in line. When we finally got to the front, we asked an employee if this line was normal. She said there were two conventions at the hotel that week and the resort was completely full. This made me think, Well, you obviously knew these conventions were booked, so why weren't more people scheduled to work at the front desk today? It was especially annoying because we had just come from a frustrating and stressful situation at the Maui airport (we almost missed our flight), and all we wanted to do was check in and relax. So much for that.There are also kids everywhere. We assumed this would be the case, given it is the summer, but we hoped the HHV would have some sort of adult pool/area like the Westin did. Nope. We hardly spent any time in the pool because we didn't like constantly being splashed by kids doing cannonballs, and the main pool is also astoundingly small for such a huge resort. We had to put our towels on the grass (?!?!?!) because there were no chairs left. If you don't get down to the pool by 9:00 a.m., forget about getting a chair. Same thing with beach umbrellas. So much for sleeping in! There are a couple other pools, but one pool (in the A'ali tower) is only for guests staying in that particular tower.Our room was very nice...except for the bathroom. The bathroom was extremely pinchy, the showerhead was set way too low (we're both tall) so that we had to crouch in the shower. I also noticed mold in the tile and the sink was rusty. Of course, the state of a hotel's bathroom is not going to ruin our honeymoon. I just thought it was odd that such a nice hotel room had such a crappy bathroom.One more thing you may want to do: buy or bring inflatable pool toys. I looked into renting a simple inner tube to float around in for the day, but it was $10!! I was not about to spend $10 to float around on a stupid inner tube for an hour or so that I could have just bought at the dollar store.So while the HHV is a nice resort, I would recommend it more for families, and definitely not for honeymooners! We should have stayed at the Moana Surfrider (Westin) or the W. If you're thinking about staying here for your honeymoon, don't. Find someplace that's smaller, more intimate, with less children and/or an adults-only area or pool.

<Content>Honeymoon in Hawaii... The Hilton Hawaiian Village on Oahu is the biggest resort I've ever stayed at, encompassing 3000 rooms, 3 pools, a lagoon, beach front property, and a complete shopping center with everything for a Louis Vutton store to an ABC Store (Oahu natives will know what that is, an island version of Wal Mart with higher prices). The pros, it's located just a bit down Wakiki, which does mean more walking, but it also allows you easy access to Ala Moana Shopping center and close access to H1 which will take you all over the island. Being so big, you could concievably never leave the resort for food, shopping and the like, but lets be honest, it's Hawaii, who wants to be cooped up in their resort the whole time. The rooms are large with decent amenties, they are in the middle of a remodel like most Hiltons with upgrades to flat screen TVs and heavenly showers. The Mandara Spa at the hotel is a very nice bright spot. Friendly and well trained staff, good amenties. It's not too overpriced for a hotel spa and definitely worth it. I don't usually notice housekeeping services unless they don't do a good job, but this staff was quick to turn around rooms and always had the rooms spic and span. Now the cons in no particular order. Don't be fooled by Ocean View offers, I am a Diamond member with Hilton and I was upgraded to an ocean view room which was really a view of a bay. Which is fine, but don't tell me it's an ocean view room. This hotel is a haven for families because it's so big so there's kids everywhere, at the pool, at the restaurants, and at the beach. Which when you're there as a couple can be taxing after the fifth game of Marco Polo breaks out . The prices at the hotel restaurants/shops are very high. You can't get a burger, fries and beer for under $24 with tip. Which I think is a bit high, even for Hawaii. The hotel is a bit under staffed, twice I called the front desk to have the phone ring for over 2 minutes while finally giving up and the valet takes forever and they don't have call down service so you have to come down and wait. Overall, I had an average stay, a little on the expensive side, but the property is very well maintained, location is good, and the rooms were clean and nice sized.

<Content>Amazing Experience with outstanding customer service! Our family just returned from a wonderful 8 day stay in the Lagoon Tower. Our party of 7 included 3 teens (18, 15 and 12) and 4 adults ranging from 40-60 years of age. We all felt that this was the nicest destination resort we have ever been to and would return there in a heartbeat.The previous reviewer ran into some customer service issues so I would like to take a moment and praise the staff. They were always friendly and very helpful to our family. We chose a late flight home and inquired about storing our luggage. The staff not only arranged that for us but also offered us a courtesy room so we could change and shower from our last day at the beach before we flew home that night. A lot has been said about the prices here so I want to state that both of these services were at no additional cost and the staff took care of everything.Is the place expensive? It's the Hilton. Need I say more? However, we did find value in some of the services they offered. By using our time share to stay in the Lagoon Tower we were able to have breakfast and lunch in the suite and only eat out for dinner. There are also no shortage of places to eat up and down Ala Moana Blvd, all within walking distances. I have to admit, I about fell over in my chair when I saw the $10 price tag for a Mai Tai but we quickly learned that they made the best, and might I say by far the most potent, of any we had on the island. We could get them cheaper next door at the Military resort but they were only $3.50 cheaper and not nearly as good or potent. The resort does have a cyclical pulse to it that you might consider when planning your trip. Thursday-Sunday is chaos as people check in and out. On Saturday, our tower alone had 163 rooms vacate and then fill back up. We arrived on a Tuesday and left on a Tuesday and had no lines to speak up and very relaxed staff. The bottom line for us is we loved the grounds, the rooms and the staff. It was a wonderful experience.

<Content>Ill suited for the crowds A huge resort on Waikiki Beach that has failed to update its facilities to accommodate the # of people. Also, problems with customer service. Using a +/- scale, here's how it adds up: We stayed 3 nights.1. Check in -- 40 minute wait in line (-2)2. Reservations -- Reservations had wrong # of people in our  party, eventhough confirmed twice. Wanted to charge us an  extra $50/Night for the 3rd person. The mgr was  requested to resolve the issue. (-1)3. Telephone Svc -- Accidently called security, mistaking the #'s  on the Hilton Map as telephone extensions. Security guard  rude on the phone and not willing to help us get the correct #  (-1)4. Pools -- Only two pools for the thousands of people there (-2)5. Cleanliness of room  customer service of housekeeper (+2)6. Elevator/Stairwells -- Waited 10 minutes on the 15th floor  waiting for an elevator that wasn't overly full. Decided to walk  down stairs only to find alarmed doors at the bottom. Went to  a phone and called security, (same rude security person)  who told us to go on out and he would re-set alarm. (-2)7. Condo pitch - Professional and low pressure. Received  $100 Hilton bucks. (+3)8. Bell Captain -- Requested that a call be made to our  transportation company back to the airport. The individual at  the transportation desk where all of the shuttles came in,  sighed, had to interrupt his crossword puzzle and seemed  put off by the request. (-1)Total: minus 4

<Content>Great trip- very quiet week This is third time I have stayed at the HHV. I was there the third full week in May. I don't know if it was that specific week, but the property was really quiet.I was in the Rainbow tower on the 22nd floor facing the marina- beautiful view. At first I was disappointed that I wasn't on the beach view side, but I ended up thinking I probably had the better view and the quieter side.The room was pretty basic. There was a small balcony, a small rather dated bathroom, and a table and chair. The odd thing was that there was not even a leisurely, comfy chair to sit in. I was there for work, so that actually mattered to me when I had to read through files at night. The positive- steps from the sand.This is crazy, but another reviewer is right when she pointed out that they do not put top sheets on the beds. Very odd. I requested a top sheet from housekeeping and it was on the bed the next day. As always the staff was very friendly, but there were definately some quirks this trip. First- the sheet thing. Amenities were hit or miss. They gave me my free breakfast certificates, and told me I could use them at Tropics and the Tapa Cafe- standard. The the Tapa Cafe hostess told me they weren't offering the free buffet because they were slow and that I could only use the vouchers at Tropics (which is very limited and opened later than I needed to leave most days). A snippy server at Tropics confirmed that I could only use the vouchers there. About halfway through the week, I found out from a colleague that the vouchers were being honored at the Rainbow Lanai, right in my building, and which has a terrific buffet. This was very disappointing to me because either the staff is not communicating at all or I was intentionally misled.Also, the towel guy at the beach was really rude. But I may be cranky too if I was a towel guy, so what the heck.Now that I've vented over the oddities of this trip, there were some very positive aspects. The Rainbow tower is actually very convenient to the parking garage. The front desk staff was fabulous. The folks at the American Express stations who help set up excursions were wonderful. A gentleman there managed to get me a plane ticket and great tour of the Island of Hawaii with only one day's notice.As one traveler noted, this is a hotel that can substitue for seeing the real Hawaii if you want to stay in a sheltered, uncomplicated environment. But you can certainly access the rest of Hawaii if you so choose. There are tours around the island, tours of the National monuments, rental cars available so you can do your own exploring, trips to swim with sharks, trips to other islands, transportation to Luau's. You can walk to the International Marketplace, the Zoo, the Aquarium, boutique shopping and great restaurants. The bus and various trolleys stop at the property. So I really don't know what the complaint about this being fake Hawaii is all about.Additionally, if you just want to chill on the property, you can shop, eat at great restaurants, order huge ice cream concoctions, enjoy the best section of the Waikiki Beach, snorkel, Kayak in the lagoon, take a mini submarine ride, ejoy great pools, great bars and great music, hit the spa, etc. There really is somethng here for everyone.The lines at registration can be long, but that is because busses and shuttles arrive with a bazillion guests who need to check in all at once. Try the zip check in if you made your reservations on line and are already familiar with the property. There is also a separate line for Hilton HHonors members. Or you could splurge on a taxi from the airport and not arrive with the bazillion other people.If you do get a taxi from the Hilton, be assured they use the best, cleanest taxis in the city. On my return trip to the airport, the attendant hailed me a stretch limo for the same fare as a regular taxi. Yes- that was fate or karma or serendipity, but it can happen.Also, for most airlines, you can check in and print your ticket at a kiosk in the main lobby.

<Content>Great Place to Stay! We just got back from a week's stay the the Hilton. What a lovely place to stay! I had read a lot of reviews before booking this hotel. I agree with most of them. The Hilton is huge, but that's okay! The grounds were just beautiful. We liked seeing the penguins and other types of wildlife.  We had an oceanfront/Diamond Head view room in the Rainbow Tower. For us, that was the only way to go. We enjoyed looking at the ocean and enjoying a cup of coffee on the balcony in the mornings. We stayed in room 2013. It was large, with a king size bed and two bathrooms! Our original room was a standard-sized room with two double beds. (I don't understand why hotels are going to double beds - too small!). This room was not what we paid for and was moved immediately. Our new room (2013) was quite lovely. I agree with all that has been written about the restaurants on the property. Way too expensive and not very good. A short walk will take you to PF Chaings, Cheesecake Factory, YardHouse, etc. The pools are really my only complaint. Some guests reserve chairs by the pool really early in the morning by placing towels on the chairs. By 9:00, you're out of luck trying to find a chair by the pool! The resort needs to put a stop to that practice. Another complaint that doesn't have anything to do with the Hilton, but you should be aware of, is was when we walked into town to eat each day, we were accosted by people handing out fliers to restaurants and shows. That was really annoying. You couldn't enjoy a pleasant walk or window shopping without a flier being shoved in your hands.The Hilton is right next door to the military hotel, the Hale Koa. It has a lovey, lush park ( Fort DeRussy ) that is great to walk through when you're walking downtown to eat. Very pretty.Enjoy your stay!

<Content>Great view - it's the only great thing though! Stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Vacation Village for 2 nights at the end of a 3 and a half week trip to New Zealand and Fiji (also both Hiltons).This was our second time to Hawaii and we arrived after an 11 hour flight from Auckland at around 10.30pm and had used a shuttle to take us to the hotel. The shuttle dropped us the 鈥渂us and shuttle鈥?stop not the front of the building but we were unaware of this as the shuttle stop is dark and not signposted. So we have 3 large suitcases and hand luggage to get to check in and not one staff member in sight. There were however the bell stand luggage trolleys so we decided to help ourselves as no one else is going to!! We later found out there is a phone here to call for assistance 鈥?but like I said its dark and you can鈥檛 see the phone!This place is huge, think Disneyworld in Hawaii! So after quite a walk (approx 3 or 4 mins) to the front desk and nearly losing the luggage off the trolley at one point only to be helped by another guest, not one of the 3 staff that walked past us, we eventually found the front desk to check in where one of the bell hops was quite rude about us borrowing a trolley for the luggage and told us we shouldn鈥檛 have done it! At check in we met another rude member of staff, who really looked like she had better things to do than serve us and barely grunted at us. My husband is a Hilton Honors Diamond VIP member and as we had paid almost $750 for a 2 night stay we were expecting the usual room upgrade. However, when she did manage to speak the front desk lady told us we weren鈥檛 getting an upgrade just breakfast. So we called a manager over who said we are being upgraded and off we head to our room 鈥?with assistance this time. The lobby area is very pretty with a large open air area decorated with tropical plants and a small seating area and views through the center of the resort over a pond to the pool and beach beyond.We booked to stay in the Rainbow tower in a room facing Diamond Head. The views were stunning and the room very large, I鈥檓 guessing double the size of the usual room as we had 2 balconies. However, the room was extremely dated, I would guess it was last decorated sometime in the late 80鈥檚 or early 90鈥檚, and the furniture worn, scratched and clearly in need of replacement. The sink faucet and drain were brown and rusted and the shower barely spluttered a trickle. It did however have the Hilton Serenity bed which are the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in! There were also 2 bathrooms, a bar area with a mini bar and plenty of closet space. The TV鈥檚 have been updated to Plasma and it does turn so you can view it either in bed or the sitting area. However, the room is so large with a 4 seat dining table in the center that viewing the TV from either the bed or the seating area wasn鈥檛 easy as it was so far away! The room had not been cleaned that well either with smears over the large mirror and glass doors and dust on the bedside cabinets.After our long flight we were hungry and usually in large hotels there is a limited room service menu available 24 hours. Not here, we just caught the soon to be closing ABC store a couple of minutes walk away to get a sandwich and a drink, otherwise we weren鈥檛 getting anything.The view from the room was really its selling point, all the way down Waikiki to Diamond Head and backwards to the rest of the resort. I can only assume they are upgrading some of the rooms as the two next to us had tape over their entrances and construction dust and the hammering that woke us up kind of gave it away too. Obviously its morning and you want to take a shower only there is no shower gel. As I said this was my third Hilton on the trip and they all have shower gel and as we had been traveling for 3 weeks and with current luggage and liquid restrictions flying we hadn鈥檛 brought any of our own. So we called the front desk and asked for shower gel, slippers and robes as these were missing too. After a 10 minute conversation trying to make someone understand we EVENTUALLY got slippers and robes but were told it was hotel policy not to provide shower gel and they had provided all that was required!! So a shower with soap it is. Frankly I was astounded that such a large resort decides not to give a simple thing like shower gel!!! We also asked for bathroom scales to check the weight of our luggage again we were told they didn鈥檛 have any. We later found out that we were lied to as we booked a day room to shower before we left and were directed to a room in another tower which lo and behold had shower gel and bathroom scales, clearly it was too much trouble to get them for us in the Rainbow tower.The resort is really beautifully landscaped with a lot of tropical planting and pools with fountains and filled with fish and many different birds. I did see the penguins and flamingos, now on a personal stand point I don鈥檛 agree with them being kept there as the area was smelly and didn鈥檛 appear well cared for (I live in Orlando and have visited Sea world hundreds of times, I know what they should look and smell like!) and there are also many parrots around the property chained to their posts and open for people and kids to throw things and torment them - and I saw some kids doing this 鈥?so don鈥檛 feel its appropriate for them to be there. It seems the main interest is how much Hilton can make from tourists having their pictures taken with them.Our departing flight the next day wasn鈥檛 until 10pm so we called to arrange a late check out. Again as Hilton Honors members this isn鈥檛 usually a problem. We were told that was arranged and we could check out at 12 noon 鈥?a whole hour later than normal! We were however told we could use the day spa for $8.00 and book a day room to shower in before we left. So we agreed to do this and booked the day room. This however was also a joke. We made our way to the Mandara Spa where we duly paid our $8 and the staff there don鈥檛 seem to have a clue what they are doing and messed around chatting rather than dealing with guests. So we both changed only to find out all facilities are gender specific and we would have to spend the afternoon apart. To top this off a corporate group of ladies had come in and I couldn鈥檛 sit down anywhere let alone get in the tiny full hot tub or even tinier steam room. So we got a refund and left and spent our last afternoon in Starbucks rather than the spa. Had we known this was the case we would have arranged to do another tour.We had complimentary breakfast that can be taken in various locations. The first morning we chose the caf茅 in the adjacent building. Waste of time it was a few cold bagels, cereal and coffee and juice. Not good even for free. The next morning we went to the Rainbow caf茅 and had breakfast and it was delicious a completely different experience. We had also used this caf茅 the previous evening for dinner and again had good service and a nice buffet 鈥?with unlimited crab legs if you like them! It鈥檚 more expensive than the mainland but not overly so and we were expecting this.We used the American Express desk to book a tour; they were reasonably helpful if a little disinterested in you as a person but it was nice and convenient being on site.The beach is of course lovely and there are plenty of sunbeds and a water sports center with surfing lessons. Like I said this place is BUSY, if you are looking for peace and quiet this is not the resort for you, but there is a good variety of eating places/bars and things to do.There are a huge range of shops on site, from high end designers to small souvenir shops, so all tastes should be catered for. The 鈥渧illage鈥?area is good with a good selection of stores and alternative places to eat. The ABC store was especially popular with pretty much everything you could need.In view of our experience on our first morning I asked at the front desk for a customer comment card. They didn鈥檛 have any. So there is a 鈥渕anager鈥?desk in the lobby and was directed to them, after a couple of minutes the 鈥渕anager鈥?decided I was worthy of speaking to and gave me a card which I promptly filled in with my disappointments and that I would be posting a review on tripadvisor and handed the card back to her. Did we hear anything in response to this? A big fat NO. Check out was easy 鈥?only thing that was 鈥?and a great thing they do have are terminals in the lobby with direct links to the major airlines to enable you to check in for your flight online and print your boarding passes.Overall a large, very impersonal resort with equally impersonal, unfriendly staff. Good central location with lots of shops and restaurants on your doorstep and easy access for tours and the airport and great views of Diamond Head and of course the wonderful beach. However, out of date rooms, poorly serviced and overpriced even by Hawaii standards.

<Author>TiredTraveler28195
<Content>Should have listened to the negative reviewers here... Everything stated in the earlier negative reviews was 110% accurate, right down to the outdated decor in the rooms. This may be the largest hotel (compound!) on Waikiki's gold coast, but it is far from the best in terms of service. First - the lack of service. For a place that boasts its world renowned so called aloha spirit, and for the prices you pay to stay here, the staff should be knocking themselves out and doing back flips to make you feel like a valued guest. Instead, upon arriving, you will be herded like cattle into the main lobby check-in, where you will be summarily ignored until the desk agent deigns to speak to you - and only when he or she is good and ready, and THEN only in the haughtiest of tones. Yes, this includes us Hilton Honors members - while we waited in a separate line for HH'ers, the wait time was no less and the service no better. In fact, it might have been worse, because you expect more from the Honors Desk. Nonetheless, after being herded into the check-in area (read: zoo) and made to wait a l-o-n-g time to get your key from staffers who clearly hate their jobs (perhaps a career change to the post office or motor vehicle dept. might be in order for some of these people), you are then given half-hearted directions to your tower. And by half-hearted, I mean, here's a map accompanied by a pointing finger and a dimissing next! yelled out in your face. And yes, we stayed in an upgraded tower - so again, this is not a question of sour grapes - admittedly, however, it is not untoward that one would want to feel welcome at *the* most expensive hotel on the strip after flying 15 hours. Then, as you shuffle off to your room, you will be further summarily ignored by all the other staffers wandering the grounds. Even at the Holiday Inn, staff greets guests with a smile or even simple hello. Once arriving at your room - after waiting 10 mins. for an elevator - you can be treated to an outdated suite or room that smells like smoke, despite it being a non-smoking room, a dirty bathroom with a tub that doesn't drain, and walls so thin you can almost hear your neighbor breathing. You may wish to then go down to the overcrowded pools or beach area, where you can basically plan on remortgaging your house if you want to take part in any beach amenity they offer - nothing is free or included at this hotel, right down to the beach chairs. Best bet if you do stay here: take your rental car to other beaches on the island, stopping at an ABC Store on the way for your beach needs. You'll save $$ and be treated to much more beautiful surroundings elsewhere, i.e. down the Pali Highway to some of those beaches. In any event - the pros of this hotel are its location, which is central/close to the strip; the 22 acres of shops/etc.; and its family-oriented themes/amenities...drawbacks are 1.) first and foremost, the staff - what is WITH these people??! and 2.) the fact that it does not deliver what it promises. 22 acres of shops and beachfront and 7 different towers sound really great - except the fantasy outlives the reality. I would recommend instead the Westin, Marriott Resort or any other of the high end resorts down on the strip. They aren't as big or as exciting as the grand Hilton, but what they lack in substance they more than make up for in service - something the Hilton could learn from.

<Content>Love this place I loved this place! We were here for a week as part of our Honeymoon before going to the Hilton Waikoloa on Hawaii Big Island, you can see my review on that place because this hotel was a hundred times better despite them both being Hiltons. We stayed in The Alii tower and I would highly recommend getting a suite in this tower, the rooms were fantastic! the view was amazing on to Waikiki beach, we didn't have a balcony because we were on the top floor but you could still open the double sliding windows and take in the scenery. Also there is a private pool for people in the Tower. The staff were great, really helpful and well presented. The room service was good in terms of cleanliness though it could have done with the cleaners coming in a little more often? Food wise there was a great selection of bars and restaurants and if you didn't like them thereis a trolley bus that goes regularly to take you into town. The only thing I would say is that the bars on site were a bit of a disappointment, no real selection of cocktails or drinks and it was the same selection in all of the bars.I would highly recommend this place, also if you are looking for excursions go to Allied T Pro in the foyer, we dealt with a lovely lovely lady called Mary (ask for her!) and she was excellent, we did some great excurisons and they were really well priced.

<Content>Great for Families Stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village from June 22-28, 2008 with my family and we had a blast. Our room was a little small but the view was magnificent. We were on the 25th floor and could see the beach and Diamond Head on a distance. We also watched the Friday night fireworks from our room. It was our first time to see them so close, you could feel the heat.One more thing we love about this hotel is the beach area it wasn't as crowded as Waikiki and felt a little safe away from the beach bums.

<Content>A great family stay. Our family spent 4 nights here before a cruise and were very satisfied. The check in during the mid-afternoon rush was lengthy - about 20 minutes and the parking garage was jammed We were booked in the Rainbow Tower and were upgraded to a Diamond Head view room without even asking. The balcony and the view from it were wonderful, especially for the Friday night fireworks. The room itself was spacious and seemed relatively new with very comfortable beds. The bathroom seemed to be a little more dated - some rust spots around access panels - and was all in one room, which makes 4 people getting ready in the morning take a little longer. The refrigerator is always a plus when traveling with the family. The huge complex itself was wonderful with shopping, pools, restaurants, wildlife, and the beach all on site without crossing any roads. There was no whirlpool/hot tub in the main pool complex, which I thought was rather strange. The parking is pricey ($22/day), but we had a great rate on a car which made it work for us. We ended up eating most meals at the restaurants nearby as the onsite places were very pricey. Check the room rates often as the AAA rate dropped twice from the time of our original booking until our stay.

<Content>The Best Ever! My husband was returning from deployment and I wanted to surprise him with a relaxing vacation to Hawaii. The entire process from the extremely helpful Hilton Reservations Agent to check-out was perfect. We stayed on the 11th floor of the Diamond Head Tower. The view of the ocean and the mountains was spectacular. The staff was very friendly and offered great tips about where to eat and places to visit while on Oahu. We are Hilton Honors members so our check in and check out process was very easy and quick. The property is very well maintained, the gardens are beautiful. We are already planning our trip back next year. This has become one of our favorites.

<Content>Nice location near shops, restaurants, and the beach We used points to stay here for one night, and had a decent stay. The rooms were nice, although they are old, and could use a new a/c system. The ones they have only go Lo/Med/Hi, and you have it running all day/night, and cannot control the temperature. Views of the ocean were amazing! Shops within the hotel complex were great, and open late for tourists. The pool was cool, but could've been bigger, as it seemed crowded. The breakfast buffet vouchers I got as a Hilton Diamond member were GREAT. Really GREAT! Get there early, and you will have some of the best (and worst for you) doughnuts and pastries, HOT from the oven. I mean, we thought they got them for a Hawaiian Krispy Kreme. Yummmmm. Tons of fresh fruits, cereals, Japanese cool stuff, oatmeal, and more. Our kids liked this hotel as well!

<Content>Good stay at the Hilton. My family and I came back last week from a stay at the Hilton. We were there for 6 nights and had a wonderful time. The check-in was quick but it was probably because we came at night on a weekday. I did see long check-in lines at times in the afternoon. It took us longer to check-out than to check-in. Eating and shopping at the 'village' is expensive so it's best to go out. The ABC store is a good place to buy milk, snacks and some souvernirs. There is another ABC store around the corner from the Hilton where we found good and inexpensive T-shirts to buy. It's best to eat breakfast at the Wailana Coffe House across the street from the Hotel. We would eat a late breakfast there and since the portions were large, we would skip lunch and wait for dinner. If you need a car, rent them from Dollar.com at least a day before you leave to Honolulu. I would rent the cheapest car from them since many times they would upgrade you anyway for the same price. We got upgraded in Oahu and when we took a day trip to Maui. We found the Hilton employees to be very friendly for the most part. I think the Hilton is a good place to stay at if you have kids. Not sure if I would stay there if I just went with the wife and wanted to avoid being in a place with kids running around. The beds at the Hilton were very comfortable and we got upgrade to a room at the Rainbow tower overlooking the beach. We all slept very well while there. I miss Hawaii and the Hilton already.

<Content>Great place for families with teens Stayed 7 nights at the HH Village. It was very easy to get to from the airport and is right in the heart of Waikiki. Had a wonderful time. There was a lot to do at the resort itself, including shopping, a bookstore, Starbucks, restaurants, and instant access to a wonderful beach. We roomed in the Rainbow Tower and it was definitely worth the extra money to have a room right over the beach. Our room had a little frig and sink area - great for doing meals or snacks in the room. There is plenty of parking (although it was an extra $20/day for self-parking). I recommend having your own car for getting around, as there is a city bus service but I think it's used more by locals than by tourists. Get hold of a good highway map in advance - or rent a GPS with your rental car - as the highway exit configurations can send you off in directions you hadn't planned to go.There is an ABC store on the HH Village premises for snacks, breakfast food, sandwiches, etc. It's very popular. You are also easy walking distance to an Outback Steakhouse, Red Lobster, Cheeseburger-Cheeseburger, and a great coffee house across Ala Moana that's open 24/7 and has wonderful breakfasts.

<Content>Great place to stay in Waikiki I stayed in the Kalia Tower. All in all, I enjoyed my stay here and would recommend it to others. The rooms are clean, modern and well equipped; there is a variety of different types and styles of restaurants on the property (Round Table Pizza, Japanese restaurant, Starbucks); a decent pool area (sometimes hard to get a free lounge chair) and easy access to Ala Moana.

<Content>NIce, but be careful with your dining choices Couple of things-Hotel and grounds are very nice. Stayed in Alii Tower Oceanfront room while my brother stayed in Kalia Tower Ocena View- i thought both rooms were fine but not sure the Alii is worth the 100+ premium over the lesser towers. One tip for booking-check the rate with Costco even if it includes a rental car. I was shocked that Costco offered me the same room with a rental car for approx $600 per week less than the best deal I was able to find when booking the room and car seperate. My biggest problem with the hotel is the overpriced and mediocore hotel dining-avoid the buffets-$35 for some of the worst overcooked food I have ever had. The privately operated dining options on the grounds such as Benihana and the NY Deli are significantly better in quality but still high in cost. Your best bet is to go 5-10 minutes off the grounds to the nearby Outback, Island Burger, or Cheesecake Factory-same quality as back home and prices not nearly as inflated-I actually thought the Cheesecake prices looked very comparable to the prices I find at my local one

<Content>A High-Rise Monstrosity Stayed here as part of a large business meeting group . We had a large suite overlooking the beach, with a large sitting room, dining room table, 2 bathrooms, etc, but the rooms furnishings, wall-coverings, etc were all extremely dated. Didn't really interact with the hotel staff much, but wouldn't really recommend this place based on the age and condition of the property. If you want an old hotel that could be in beachfront Ft Lauderdale, you can save yourself the time in a plane and go the Fl. If you want to experience Hawaii, pick another spot on this (or preferably another) island.

<Content>few complaints i enjoyed a very nice stay at the HHV. the PROs are many: large, clean rooms that are well-appointed. long, wide, marble vanity in the bathroom and even includes a drawer. our room had two small refrigerators. one was obviously supposed to be a minibar, but it was empty. there is a long, wide work desk and plenty of bureau and closet space. the grounds are stunning. the on-side restaurants are plentiful and varied, as are the shops. the parking garage is large and well-designed with easy in-and-out using your room keycard. nice towels, nice beds. some decent entertainment in the lovely outdoor lounge areas. pretty much a self-contained resort that is a looong walk away from the hustle-and-bustle of the primary waikiki area. easy egress right off ala moana blvd.now the CONs: nickled-and-dimed a bit. ten bucks a day for a wired internet connection seems petty. wireless is supposed to be free in the lounge areas, but i couldn't log onto the one time i lugged my laptop downstairs. self-parking is $22 per day. the gym costs extra. the conceirge desks--there are several--is rather useless. i asked about a fairly new restaurant in waikiki--they had never heard of it, but it turns out it is in a sister Hilton property a mile away and has already graced the local magazine cover. a loooong walk away from the primary waikiki area (which is also a PRO). all in all, though, i had a great stay and would certainly return.

<Content>Best in Waikiki I personally do not like Waikiki. Honolulu in general is a bit dated...The decor has not changed or progressed for the better. In fact, the whole city still hasn't changed much since Hawaiian Five -O period. However, because there is a direct flight from where we live, we choose to go there every year whenever we need some sun and beach. That being said, out of all the hotels in Waikiki, I believe Hilton Hawaiian Village is the most updated. The room is very clean and not claustrophobic. The services at Mandara spa is one of the best I've experienced. The restaurants are on the spendy side, but you could always leave the village and eat elsewhere. As for the rude Hawaiian staff, I found the poor attitude elsewhere in Hawaii as well.

<Content>Perfect in paradise! We stayed at the HIlton Hawaiian Village for a week in the middle of June. We all loved the resort. We stayed in the Ali'i tower. Rooms were clean and comfortable and the private pool was nice. We selected the Ali'i tower because we thought the other buildings would be too far from the super pool. Rainbow Tower is the same distance to the pool. The beach was beaufiful. Too cloudy to snorkel there. The lagoon was nothing special. There's no need to leave the resort once you check in. The only downside is that food and drinks are extremely high priced even by Hawaii standards. The breakfast buffett was very plentiful- lots of selection.  We tried to sign up for the lei making and ukele lessons but they were already booked up for the week once we checked in. that was a bit disheartening So, try to book early. They have a very limited number of spaces available- not enough given the number of people that stay at the resort.  The tropical penguins were adorable. Try to get to one of the feeding times- they will allow you to pet them.A Catholic Mass and also an inter-denominational church service are available on Sunday. The Hilton has thought of everything- really no need to leave the resort.  We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Best Value - they treat you like royalty! Our most wonderful experience was at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The view from our room was spectacular.The interesting things-to-do are endless here. You don't even have to leave the property to experience something new every day. The staff here are trained to treat guests with the utmost respect and do everything in their power to make your stay exceptional. To make our stay even more pleasant, the restaurant located in the building where we were staying, provided complimentary breakfast each morning.Wow, I didn't want to leave.I HIGHLY recommend this property. It is the very best that Hawaii has to offer all tourists.

<Content>Hated The Hilton Hawaiian Village Dont Come Here!I've been to Hawaii a total of 10 times over the past 20 years, and this place is by far the worst place I've ever been to--anywhere (not only Hawaii!!). Just to let you know, I am NOT affiliated with any travel agency, hotel or service. I am a person who does a lot of traveling and enjoys going to tropical locations for vacations. This place is awful. First, it is 4 huge towers. Only one is on the beach. The others are set back. They claim to have ocean views, but you really have views of other towers. If you stick your neck out far enough from the balcony, you get a glimmer of the ocean. The four towers completely shadow the pool--the pool does not get sunshine after noon! I go to Hawaii to enjoy the ocean and the sun, and there isn't any by the pool. The service is arrogant. The hostess(es) in the restaurants couldn't care less if you are there. The beach attendants are worse. I asked for a beach towel and the attendent wouldn't give it to me, claiming they weren't open yet (even though the towels were there, attendants were there, and it was nearly 9 AM, when they are supposed to open at 8:30; the attendant told me they were on Hilton time, which meant that they would open when they felt like it). I went to the men鈥檚 room one afternoon and the Janitor was in there cleaning. After washing my hands, I noticed that there weren't any hand towels. I asked him for some, and he told me they were out. This is a 2000 room hotel and they are out of hand towels? I called up house keeping to send me some pillows, and it took 3 hours. They arrived at midnight, after I was asleep for an hour. I put a do not disturb sign on my door, and so, they called my telephone to ask if they can come in (after all---they wouldn't want to knock on my door, since I had the sign up! Instead, they figured that they could telephone me and that somehow wouldn't disturb me!)I get the impression that the employees truly don't care about working there. They have no pride in their work whatsoever. The location doesn't help. The hotel is near downtown Waikiki and the traffic in and around the place is awful. It takes 30 minutes to get away from the hotel to drive anywhere. One day, I drove around the island to look for other sites that I might consider for future stays. I would stay away from any hotel on Waikiki. It simply is far too congested. The traffic is like downtown New York, Tokyo or LA. It is just bad. I did find two places on Oahu that looked good; the Marriott Ihilani (NOT the Marriott in Waikiki) and the Resort at Turtle Bay. I have not stayed at either place, but they have nice beaches, friendly staff and are full resorts, so that you can get anything you want. I stayed a half-day at both places, just lounging on their beaches and eating their food. I think that the prices are similar (or lower) and you are better off at these places than the Hilton. Unless you have a strong desire to spend a lot of money and get frustrated, I'd recommend staying away from this place.

<Content>Really Enjoyed Staying Here! My friend and I wanted a resort to stay in while we were in Honolulu for a week. We found the Hilton Hawaiian Village a great place to stay for a week. There is alot to see and take advantage of at the resort. It is a little pricey, but it is worth it. We found it to be a easy location to find in Honolulu, the pool and beach were fantastic, and the restaurants on the property were very good-expensive, but good.I found the hotel to be very clean, staff is accommodating and friendly. They have opened a new tower and are pushing the time shares, but just ignore that and have a good time. The spa is amazing!

<Content>Kalia Tower is a great place to stay! My husband and I stayed at the HHV for one week while we were on Oahu. We loved it! Here is what you need to know: Waikiki is very touristy and this hotel/resort is no exception. There are a lot of people and there is a lot of activity. So, if densely populated resorts are not your thing and you would rather be in a tent cooking your dinner over an open flame, the HHV is not for you. However, if you enjoy getting out and doing things but having a beautiful, spacious, clean, quiet space with a comfy king size bed to fall into at the end of the day, the Kalia Tower is for you. Plus, the HHV has beatufiful grounds, several shops and restaruants, and it is within walking distance of many more restaurants and much more shopping.The Kalia Tower is beautiful, clean, and QUIET. They have their own check in desk at the tower, so we did not experience the long, rude check in process that some of the other reviewers complained about. (However, to be honest, we did walk by the main check in counter a couple of different times and the line was long and the lobby crowded). When we were in our suite we could hear nothing from the outside. It was awesome! We slept like babies every single night. We had a suite with a full kitchen and living area, and it was the perfect home base for us on Oahu. We rented a car so that we would not have to spend all of our time at the resort/at Waikiki. Our suite at the Kalia Tower was always a great place to come home to because it was so nice and quiet. There is also a smaller pool in the Kalia Tower, so you don't have to leave the tower to go sun yourself. The pool is much smaller and intimate then the big super pool at the resort. However, we were very disappointed that there was no pool bar at our pool. If you like a cocktail or a snack while sunning yourself, no dice at the Kaila Tower. FOOD: There are a ton of chain restaurants in Waikiki---don't be a slave to them!!!!!!!! You don't have to! Eat lunch for the sushi at Todai which is right across the street from the HHV. Ask the concierge where the Chart House is and eat dinner there; it is within walking distance. Go to dinner at the Hau Tree at Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel on Waikiki---very romantic! Aaron's at the top of the Ala Moana Hotel is delicious with an amazing view of Honolulu! Both Aaron's and the Hau Tree are either a very cheap cab ride or a short drive from the HHV. Do go to Duke's on Waikiki. While it is a popular tourist spot, it is a really cool place and the food is good. Since we had a suite with a full kitchen, we ate breakfast in every morning and we ate lunch on our lanai a couple of times. We ate only one time at the HHV resort--at the beachside place. The view of the ocean was fantastic, the food mediocre, and the waitress rude. GO: To the North Shore. It is so beautiful and it is a world away from the busy Waikiki. Eat at Halewia Joe's and/or at Giovanni's shrimp truck while at the North Shore. Have some shaved ice. GO: if you are in the hunt for souveniers and gifts, it is worth getting up early and heading to the swap meet (Weds and Sats) at Aloha Stadium. Much better prices than in the shops on the island. GO: If you have never been to Pearl Harbor, you must put this at the top of your list. GO: Hike Diamond Head. It is a good climb and the views are amazing. I know there are a ton of other places, restaraunts, and things to do on Oahu. These are just some of the things we had time for in our one week. But no matter what you do, the Kalia Tower at HHV is an awesome place to call home while you are on the island!

<Content>A theme hotel for families with children My wife and I stayed six nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and determined that this hotel would be great for families with children. But we do not have children. The hotel offers an opportunity to spend every dollar you've saved for your vacation and more. The nickeled and dimed posts are accurate. Expensive but very mediocre food and drinks. We ultimately decided not to eat in the hotel, except for at a few of the restaurants in the Village section of the property. They have a decent Japanese restaurant, noodle shop, and ... well, that's about it. The hotel dinner buffet was disappointing. At $25 or so (which is on the low side for a dinner buffet on Waikiki), I didn't expect much and got about, if not a little under, what I expected. The breakfast buffet, though, was shameful. $25 for a poor spread without any of the custom omlette, waffle bar, or meat stations that one generally expects for that price. Just eggs in a tub, meat in a tub, etc. And if you order coffee or juice, be prepared to pay around $3/each for those orders in addition to the $25 breakfast charge. My wife and I found that we could walk down to Duke's Canoe Club, a restaurant on the beach -- a half mile or so walk down Waikiki in the morning -- and get all of the services one expects at a breakfast buffet for under $14 each. The hotel was decently furnished, but a little dated, and didn't seem like much of a value for the $350/night we were paying. The beach area is nice compared to the other hotels. The pools are nice, but very crowded with chairs and understaffed by waiters. And be prepared for the $9 so-so drinks. And you can't take that drink you just bought on the beach (or at least you're not supposed to). The hotel offers many accomodations for the beach bum -- chairs, umbrellas, floats, etc., but at a posterior puckering price.Overall, this is a theme hotel, for those who either don't want to take the effort to see the real Hawaii and are content to have a manufactured version at their doorstep (like a Vegas hotel), or those families with small children who need a hotel where they can experience a Hawaiian feel without having to leave the hotel property much. If you're after the real Hawaii, you'll be able to find it no matter where you stay by venturing out on day trips. See Chinatown. See the north shore. See Pearl Harbor. Eat at the places your guidebook advises you to eat. But its a bit of a waste of money to pay for this hotel only to need to escape from it on a daily basis. Its an expensive place to use as your base to come sleep at night. For families with kids, go for it. For older persons who are limited in ability to do long walks or frequent travel, go for it. For young people, singles, DINKS, or business travelers, you'll probably feel like this hotel was designed with someone other than you in mind.

<Content>Disappointed We were staying one eve. in the Hawaiian Village moving from Okinawa Japan back to US. My husband is in the military and we wanted to stay in Hale koa, the hotel beside the village; however it was booked and I thought it's only 1 night --We should stay somewhere nice, so we booked at Hawaiian village. We ended up spending most of our time at the military hotel as the food was so much cheaper and it was so much more quiet--The bed we slept on didn't have sheets--maybe that's the new thing now I don't know. It took the bell hop 45min to bring luggage up. The lady at the checkin was rude. and it took over an hr since it was so busy . I felt bad for all the hardworking middle class folks that thought this was nice--because maybe they've never experienced anything really nice or perhaps we just got the chort end of the stick that day/night.

<Content>Tropics among the high rises Let me start by saying that we have stayed at this property probably between 8 and 10 times. I will start with why we select this hotel. Honolulu is a concrete jungle and although there are palm trees everywhere, you never feel like you are in the tropics until you come to the Hilton. The entire property is Hawaii at its best, palm trees swaying, tropical fish and birds, and beautiful florals. The beach is huge and uncrowded. On a busy day, you can still find plenty of sand space and room in the ocean. The hotel has very calm waves that are great if you are a non-swimmer or have small children. We always stay in the Rainbow Tower because of the proximity to the shoreline. The odd number rooms all face Diamond Head and are preferred over the marina view rooms (although those rooms get the sunset). You really can't lose if you are in the Rainbow Tower. Rooms also have refrigerators which is a huge plus. You can stock up on your favorite items and avoid the high prices at the bar and convenience stores. The location of the Hilton is perfect for us. There is the village that is nice to stroll through and of course there is an ABC store for necessities. Additionally, it is an easy walk to the heart of Waikiki, yet you are a world away from the hustle and bustle of Kalakaua Ave. Shuttle buses are available to the Ala Moana Mall and Waikiki. You can easily stay at the Hilton and not need a car.Now for the things that the Hilton can improve on. The property is getting old and beginning to show wear and tear in the rooms. The carpets aren't as fresh as they used to be, the furniture is dated and worn and the bathroom fixtures need updating. New management has taken over the property and they are really pushing the time share aspect. It used to be that you got two waters per day in your room. Now you get two waters per stay and you need to collect them from the time share (oh excuse me, vacation ownership) desk. If you are annoyed by time share pitches, skip the two 8 oz. water bottles. You won't even miss them. I really think the hotel needs a face lift. The other major properties in Waikiki are renovating (Moana Surfrider, The Royal Hawaiian, The Outrigger Reef, and the Sheraton to name a few) and if the Hilton wants to remain a premier property, they should follow suit. Eventually, it will hurt their return business.I have stayed at other properties on Oahu, but we keep coming back to the Hilton. For the most part, the property is great and the positives out weigh the negatives. If you are in Honolulu and want peace and quiet, this is the place to be. If you can overlook the wear in the rooms, you will not be disappointed. FYI, I cannot speak to the food at the hotel as we have only eaten breakfast at the Rainbow Lanai. It is an excellent buffet and has a large assortment of food. We get the meal included with our room, so I am not sure if it would be worth the full cost everyday. Unfortunately, I have an aversion to hotel food when it comes to dinners and opt for other favorites such as Duke's, Hula Grill, Chart House and the Yard House.

<Content>Lovely grounds! Very nice! We stayed here one night on our way to Australia.The hotel is lovely with beautiful grounds. It is large!! It takes you quite a while to get from place to place!We booked a corner oceanfront room in the Rainbow Tower which had a lovely view. The room was good size but the bathroom was very small. It was nice but nothing out of the ordinary except for the view.The hotel is in a nice location if you want to stay in Waikiki. You can walk along the ocean to the other hotels and restaurants.We had a very nice breakfast in Tapa Cafe which was the only full restaurant open early. It was a perfect choice for a stop over!

<Content>Hilton Large But Gorgeous  Hilton Hawaiian Village is size/capacity of some towns, but yet it manages to be personal and efficient! Want to first thank HHV for making our 30th wedding anv'y/family reunion a memorable week by upgrading us to beautiful suite in Tapa Tower and promptly taking care of every request! We were greeted with congratulations note and fruit platter in our room.Upon arrival bell staff asked if we were checking in, which tower and would we like baggage service and parking. Quickly emptied our vehicle and gave us ticket explaining to give to front desk, they would handle the rest. Luggage was immediately waiting for us with very friendly bellman by time we reached our room! By way, open air check-in foyer is large with sweeping views of Super Pool onto Waikiki Beach, with lush gardens, waterfall, koi river, huge fresh floral arrangements (found all around resort), couches and chairs, bar to right and tropical birds, welcome to Hawaii and Hilton Hawaiian Village!!!Highly recommend anyone staying at HHV to join the Hilton Honors Program which provides many benefits for their members. Some immediate benefits for HHonors members is their own check-in line upon arrival! Honors front desk knows exactly what complimentary items members should receive ie breakfast coupons, upgrades, coupon booklet, etc. and moves their line quickly and efficiently. Do recommend contacting HHV at least week prior to arrival to request specific tower and/or upgrade. There are 5 towers (6th being finished), Rainbow Tower and Ali'i Tower (has it's own fitness center and private pool only accessed by Ali'i guests) are directly on Waikiki Beach with fabulous views down beach to Diamond Head, Super Pool or harbor/lagoon side. Lagoon Tower which is all timeshare placed other side of Rainbow Tower (toward harbor) right behind the newly redone lagoon area with views of lagoon, harbor, Waikiki Beach and resort. Hilton is building Waikikian Tower which will be all timeshare as well, placed back from Lagoon Tower (toward harbor). Diamond Head Tower is behind Ali'i Tower, with Tapa Tower back further with views inbetween Rainbow and Ali'i Tower to beach/ocean, Super Pool, resort, harbor and moutain/city. Back further from Tapa Tower is Kalia Tower with views between Rainbow and Lagoon Tower. Kalia Tower is part timeshare, but has resort fitness center and Mandara Spa. Hilton has very cleverly spread placement of their towers with their individual pools and restaurants, within their meticulously manicured gardens, flowing koi river, waterfalls, penquin habitat, shopping areas, restaurants, entertainment/bars, beach and lagoon to optimise every possible view from room's balconies and windows! HHV never seems to be overcrowded because of it's spreadout layout and so many varied areas.Benihana in village is both delicious and entertaining, also found prices reasonable based on other restaurant tabs in downtown area. Bali By The Sea is magical evening with sunset and exceptional pacific rim food. Rainbow breakfast every morning with omelet station and variety of food was excellent. We upgraded our HHonors free breakfast coupons to hot breakfast late morning, for more of brunch, skipping lunch. Open air beach restaurant at Ali'i Tower was quick good food with great tropical drinks and relaxing beach/ocean views with tropcial breezes. Don't miss treating yourself to ice cream store on corner across from foyer/check-in lobby! ABC store near Benihana is great for stocking up your room's refrig and inexpensive quick snacks. In the evening there is free live entertainment to be found at inviting bar areas. Don't miss the Hula show and fireworks every Friday night around the Super Pool! Romantic walks around the grounds, lagoon and Waikiki Beach in evening with torches glowing make for perfect end of each vacation day.Beachwalk shopping area has great shopping, restaurants and bars with entertainment. Ala Moana Shopping Ctr is unbelievable shopping and dining experience. Don't forget to rent vehicle and tour the island of Oahu with it's historical area of Pearl Harbor. Drive East (Leeward Side): hike up Diamond Head (paved/stairs, bring water, sunscreen  camera), snorkel at Hanauma Bay, visit Sandy Beach and if you would like some hiking on paved path with more spectacular views hike up to Makapu'u Lighthouse (again bring water etc). Can drive around top island to North Shore with countless beaches and views. Or drive directly to North shore to Turtle Bay and Waimea Falls Park area another day. The manmade Ko Olina lagoons and beaches on West (Wai'anae Side) are good for families as well as couples. The island of Oahu is rich with natural beauty as well as city life!Highly recommend purchase and use of Oahu Revealed/The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki  Beyond guidebook. We found it to be accurate and essential with directions, reviews and suggestions!HHV is very centrally located for touring Oahu and enjoying downtown areas. It's also very convenient from Honolulu Airport. We hope you try HHV and find it as unforgettable of a vacation experience as we did.

<Content>FANTASTIC! Right on the beach with a great pool This was a fantastic hotel. I knew it would be since it was a Hilton and the list of amenities is endless. This was my first trip to Hawaii. We booked the Hilton for only one night as we were boarding a cruise ship the next day. As we pulled up to the front of the hotel, there were cute tiki torches all lit up to greet us. Our room was perfect with a great view overlooking the huge pool and beach. The hotel is right on Waikiki Beach and there were lots of people out enjoying the beach. My only complaint is that it's a very kid friendly hotel. Lots of kids in the water hogging up your pool space. Oh, well. I would definitely stay here again. Overall it was fabulous!

<Content>Excellent choice for families We stayed at the Diamond Head tower with a view of the ocean. It was a very comfortable, quiet room with a beautiful view. Our two children, ages 9 and 11, had a blast at the resort, taking surfing lessons, hanging out at the beach, and exploring the resort which is quite large. They got a kick out of the resort's animal residents, the tropical penguins, flamingoes, parrots, and more. The resort staff are extremely helpful--they showed us how to get to where we wanted to go. Public transportation is a breeze, whether by city bus or trolley. The only drawback: the high prices. This wasn't just the resort--Hawaii in general is very costly, partly due to high gas prices (since they have to fly so much into the islands from elsewhere). You have to be prepared to spend more than you ever thought possible! Compared with this vacation, Disney World was downright affordable (we went there last year, in May '07). But it was a spectacular experience, and well worth the high price. I highly recommend this resort.

<Content>A very comfortable resort We just returned from six nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We had a great time! The place is huge, clean, and very well maintained. Everything we experienced was top quality, the carp ponds and birds are outstanding. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is that I felt nickel and dimed at times. Some of the conceirges seemed more interested in selling me timeshares than giving me information, but others were very helpful. Something like $30 to rent an umbrella for the day (we bought one for $19 at the ABC store, it was smaller and we had to rig it up ourselves, but it worked), and $15 per beach chair for the beach seemed excessive to me for guests of the over $300/night rooms. Things like no free internet, $4 muffins, $3.50 sodas, and $25 for a chair at the friday night parade all added up quick. And the place is so huge it was inconvenient to get off the grounds to eat.On the other hand the place is so huge that you never have to leave, and once you stop worrying about the constant outflow of money, it's a very nice, clean, safe place to spend relaxing time with the family at the beach or pool by day, or walking the torchlit grounds at night, or just sitting on our balcony in the rainbow tower looking out at diamond head and down at the beach. Everyone told us Waikiki was a terrible beach, but the beach by the hotel was wide enough that we easily found a nice spot, and the reef and jetty there made it calm enough for kids to swim. We did walk down to central waikiki and it the beach was much narrower with more people and crashing surf, I wouldn't have wanted to lay on the beach there, but the hilton beach was relaxing, albeit crowded, but hey, it's waikiki.The polynesian parade was fun, you can sign up your small kids to lead in with the parade, and they get to sit up front without the $25 charge for poolside seating, my five year old daughter loved being in the parade. The hula and firedancers were entertaining if contrived, and the fireworks were nice.Is the Hilton Hawaiian Village at Waikiki the most touristy spot on the planet? Perhaps. Does it cost $50 every time you turn around? Definitely. But if you can embrace your inner tourist and enjoy it for what it is, you'll have a great time. I will return, but probably for 3 or 4 nights next time on my way to (or from) more off the beaten path locales.

<Content>The Best Place to Stay in Waikiki I have tried every beach front hotel in Waikiki and none of them can compare to Hilton Hawaiian Village. It has the widest stretch of beach. If you look at an aerial view of Waikiki Beach, you will be amazed at how large the beach is. Plus is always uncrowded. The hotel grounds are beautiful with ponds, waterfalls, lush foilage and lots of wildlife...even a pond of African penguins. They are so cute. They have a little one named Baby Mana that they even have a stuffed animal that you can get when you just eat 5 meals at the hotel. We got several of them for the kids and they were thrilled. I really don't know why so many of hte reviews say that the food is so expensive at the resort. It is simply not true. The resort has a variety of places to eat. We counted 18 different places to eat and they ranged from a beautiful beach front restaurant called the Bali by the Sea (the food and views are excellent). If you've never tasted island pacific rim cooking, you have to try the food at Bali by the Sea. They have two more ocean front restaurants that are very affordable: a steak and seafood restaurant and a coffee shop type restaurant called Rainbow Lanai. Other restaurants include Benihana, Sergios Italian Restaurant, Roundtable Pizza, a deli, a Japanese restaurant, a beach cafe and others. Here's another tip: the hotel has great kids meals (very large) and only cost $7.50 and they give they a cute toy with it. The kids wanted to go back everyday. We did most days but also went to other restaurants at the hotel and outside. Don't forget to use the great coupon book that they give you at the front desk. it has great discounts at all the restaurants and the 80 shops at the hotel. The best things about the resort are these:1) It is on the largest, uncrowded beach 2) It has the largest ocean front pool and there are about five other pools that you can use all over the resort. They are also building another pool with water slides. All of the other hotels in Waikiki have postage stamp sized pools.3) There is a huge ocean fed lagoon at the hotel that you can kayak in or ride watertoys in. It is fabulous for little kids and only 5 feet deep. We had so much fun there.4) Beautiful grounds5) Very nice staff that are always willing to help. We have made some great friends there. There's a waitress named Kacie at the Hau tree bar that sings when she speaks. She is a sweetie pie. 6) Safe. The hotel is actually a resort on 22 acres and is set apart from the crowded busy side of Waikiki. It's fun to go to that side, but it is nice to come back to the quiet Hilton Hawaiian Village. 7) there is so much to do at the resort. They have a great chldren's program that my kids just love. 8) Rooms are nice (Hilton does a good job)9) Stay on a Friday night. There is a great Hawaiain hula show with fire dancers that takes place at the pool. It is cheap. Only $25 per person and includes a free Mai Tai or soft drink.. The best thing is that it ends with a huge fireworks show over the beach. We were amazed. It was beautiful and it happens every Friday night right there. If you don't want to go to the show, you can watch the fireworks from the beach or from your guest room.I would highly recommend this resort because it is clean, safe, fun and great value. Remember, you're going on vacation and you're going to spend money. I found that the hotel went out of its ways to make it possible for families to have a great afflordable vacations. You can't go wrong with this place!!! You will love it.

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian Village, a great property The family and I just returned from a 7 day stay in the Hilton Hawaiian Village and we had a great time. The wife and I were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary and decided to stay at the village because we were going to have over 12 people in total with 4 children under 11 and thought this would be a great place to spend our 7 days. While the Village is a great property there were a few proplems. We stayed in the newer Kalia tower the newest of the 4 towers on the property and we had an ocean view. The room was average size, a little small for the amount of money the hotel charges, but the view is probably the reason for the rate. A plus about the room is that there was a little mini fridge in the room which would play a major role in our stay. We had 2 doubles in the room which were very comfortable. There was a standard 32 inch TV in the room with many cable channels. But again for the money that was charged there should definately be a flat screen in the room. But that is a minor issue. In the room were also a wet bar, a safe (which you can use for a minor fee) a writing desk and a recliner. High speed internet was also available for a small fee. The bathroom was a good size with a bath and shower. In our tower itself there was a spa and pool on level 4 and a Starbucks and a store selling those miniture guitars that are so popluar in Hawaii in the lobby.  The grounds at the Hawaiian Village were beautiful and big! To get from one part of the property to the other it took a little walking but at least you had a lot of eye candy to look at while you were walking. There were flamingos, penguins, parrots, many types of birds all walking around on the property. Also many different types of flowers, trees, and other plant life. I definately had the feel of being in Hawaii just by walking around the resort. My wife and mother loved the fact that there were over 90 different types of shops on the hotel grounds. So any time we had to walk across the grounds for any reason it gave them an excuss to just look. The only drawback with the grounds that I can think of is the traffic. Because there are a lot of people in the Village there are cars that constantly come and go out of the property. So you always have to be careful that you watch were you go when you cross the street within the property when you go to the other side of the Village. Within the property there are many different resturants serving a variety of foods. There was an Italian resturant, a Japanese steakhouse were they cook the food right in front of you, Bar and Grills, and even a Round Table Pizza. You could also find on the property an Ice Cream parlor, a Hot Dog place and a buffet resturant that was open to the outside private beach. If you decide to eat at the resturants, however, make sure that you bring plenty of cash because they are not cheap. Each resturant is at least 2 times as much as the same type of resturant would on the mainland. Even Round Table and the Ice Cream parlor were much higher then normal. But, I guess that is the price you pay for being in Hawaii. Many of our dinners were spent outside of the resort (luau, dinner cruise and others) so we didn't have to spend the high prices. When we did want lunch we went down to the ABC store right on the property and bought lunch meat, bread chips and sodas and used the fridge in our room. We saved a lot of money doing that. Not that we were being cheap, but i just couldn't see myself spending $30.00 for a kids lunch that they probably would even finish. On the property there were many places to swim. There was the swimming pool hot tub on the 4th floor of our tower. They were a little small so we were only there 1 time. We spent much more time at the Super Pool, private beach and lagoon on the property. Every time we went to the Super Pool we had a good time. We always had chairs to sit our stuff on, there never seemed to be a lot of people there, and the pool was so big we could splash around a little. The lagoon was lovely. Again not a lot of people when we went so we could spread our stuff out of the beach and have a good time. We rented a paddle boat and went around the lagoon which the kids loved. The only drawback with the lagoon and also the beach was you had to rent beach chairs. I felt for the amount you pay for everything they could at least let us use the beach chairs for no charge.  Overall we had a great time at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. They have everything you can think of right on the property and the service was great as well. If a person wanted to they can stay right on the resort and never leave; I wouldn't recommend it because there is so much to do on the island, but you could. The only problems I had with the resort is the size of the room for the money, the price of the resturants and you get nickel and dimed for things that could've been included. But with that said, if your looking for a hotel for the family I would recommend the Hilton Hawaiian Resort.

<Content>Family friendly oceanfront in Waikiki The *only* reason we stay in Waikiki is because I want to be near the ocean when I come to Hawaii and we are visiting our family in Honolulu. We spend as little time in Waikiki as possible outside of the hotel, taking drives to North Shore or other areas far from the concrete jungle of Waikiki and eating and shopping away from tourist areas. Even the large Ala Moana shopping center is better ambience than Waikiki, unless you are on the beach! When you don't feel creative for a meal, either walk to the coffee shop across the street from the hotel (prepare for a line) or drive to any Zippy's--and on your way back from Zippy's stop at the grocery store for some drinks and snacks to have in the room instead of paying $4 for a coke and $7 for a beer.Since Hilton Hawaiian Village is away from the heart of Waikiki, the beach isn't too crowded and it's a mix of hotel guests and a few locals. The pools are perfectly nice, not fantastic. Hilton will give you all the towels you need, which is a very nice convenience. We have only been here slightly off season (like April after Spring Break), other reviews have said the quality of their vacation goes down when the village is more crowded. The kids love the pools, the beach, the animals, and walking around the shops.We stayed in a Diamond Head Tower suite. The suites are on floors 14-17. Floor 16 allows smoking on the balconies, the hotel advises not staying on Floor 17 because you are above the smokers. Floor 14 has longer balconies, which we ended up not using because we spent practically all our hotel spare time at the beach or pool. You enter the suite in the bedroom, then past the bathroom there is a living room and the balcony.The view from the suites is enough to know you are on the ocean, but not that special. The best thing about the suites is really having that extra room, especially if one or both of you is awake while the kids are sleeping.

<Content>Love the HHV!!!!!!! This is my second time staying at this hotel. The first time I stayed in the Tapa Tower for about a week and had a lovely, but average, Hilton room. It was very clean and the view was nice. But I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to stay in Tapa again. On the plus side, it was relatively close to the parking garage- which I had to use each day to get my car to get to my work site. The bad- the elevators were always crowded.This past trip I stayed in the Diamond Head tower for 16 nights. I was there for work again, but brought my boyfriend with me as he had just returned from Iraq and had terminal leave. By this time I was a Diamond member and they upgraded me from a regular room in Tapa to a one bedroom, ocean front suite with a separate living room and huge balcony. It was wonderful. We could choose whether to go out in the hotel for a drink or just relax on that balcony in our own little (beautiful) world.Beyond the room, I have to say that the staff was excellent. The housekeeping staff was frinedly and did a fantastic job. The reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful. When my boyfriend lost the waterproof container with his room key and credit card even the manager on duty got involved- calling everywhere she could think of to help us.Here's a funny tip that remained true throughout both trips- the mai tais and tropical itches suck at the Tapa Bar, but they are wonderful at the Shell bar and in the little restaurant on the beach. We had no complaints about the restaurants or shops and found the American Express travel desk representatives very helpful in booking trips.In a nutshell, the HHV is clean, has great views, good service, and is its own self contained village.

<Content>Nice stay at the Hilton Just returned from business trip and a 6 night stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort. If you are looking for a resort like feel this is your place. After hearing stories about checkin- I was pleasantly surprised. It took 10 minutes and I quickly got my partial ocean view room which was quite lovely and clean. All the rooms have balconies and offer pretty nice views. The prices in the resort were affordable for regarding snacks,etc. The breakfast/lunch prices were overpriced.Pros and cons of location:A bit out of the way from the Beachwalk- restaurant row in Waikiki - about a 10-15 minute walk. However, what you gain is pretty much the quietest strip of beach in Waikiki. Not only is it a pretty large beach compared to other hotels down the strip it is also pretty calm water and not full of large crowds.Restaurant Recommendations:Roy's on Lewer Street is pricey but is a must go! We took trips into Chinatown (about $14 cab ride from hotel) and recommend the restaurant, Indigo.Other suggestions:Take the time and rent a car and explore the island- any beach on the island would be well worth it and in addition recommend the hike to the Maunawili Falls

<Content>Rent a Condo or House instead We stayed four days at the Hilton Hawaiian Village to celebrate our 18th Wedding Anniversary. We had an ocean view room which was nice and comfortable but nothing special. The resort has many amenities, plenty of shops and restaurants, but if you鈥檙e on a budget this is not the place to stay. The beach was really crowded, so we were happy to have a rental car to get out of there. Self parking will cost you $22.00 per day, but it will be more cost effective than eating at the resort, since the food is mediocre and extremely expensive. The island is beautiful, once you get out of the Honolulu area with all the mega resorts and traffic congestion. The hotel stuff were not very friendly, we found it very strange that they never bothered to ask about our stay when checking out and most of them look like they were chewing on a lemon. We do a lot of travelling and we are always willing to try new places, but if we ever visit Oahu again we will either rent a condo or a house. If you don't mind big crows, noise and a prefab experience go for it

<Content>Great Stay Aloha , my wife and I stayed in the Lagoon Tower which is part of the Hilton Grand Vacation Club 4/20-25. Took a shuttle from airport for $18 rather than the $35+ for a cab and also got a free tour from our driver cousin john who pointed out stuff to us on the way. We were one of the first stops so the ride was about 30 minutes from the airport.  Check in was a breeze and our room was ready when we arrived at around 1pm. Our one bedroom came with a separate living room, full kitchen and balcony with a table and four chairs, which over looked the marina next door (which cousin john said is where the minnow took off on it's three hour tour). Very nice view especially sunsets, howvere it's also the side that most of the construction is taking place so from 6:30 am to 4:30 pm it was very nosiey. So if that bothers you ask for a even number room .  As mentioned before prices our very high even for Honolulu, paid $11 for a pina colada and $4 for a scoop of ice cream. However there are coupon books availble with discounts for just about every store and resturant at HHV. and the ABC store is a must for snacks ect. However if you can't find anything to do there you aren't looking hard enough , from every kind of water adventure to ukeleli lessons. The walk from the hotel to waikiki is about 30 minutes which you can navigate either by sand or street.  If you rent a car from hertz at the hotel you get 1 day free parking which is $21 per day self park. A mustang convertable cost us $100 per day which included taxes. By the way sales tax is only 4%. All in all the property is very nice with plenty to activities both in and around the complex. We ate at Hatsuhana's several times as it had reasonable lunch specials (try the Loco Moco) and the rainbow lanai , which i thought was pricey from the quality , but the service was excellent. We even ate at Roundtable Pizza after all how much rice can one eat! Best advise I can give is just enjoy your self in paradise and take pleanty of sun screen . Aloha

<Content>Beautiful family friendly resort We had a wonderful stay at the HHV for one week. It's a great family resort with beautiful, lush grounds and plenty of animals/birds/fish on site to keep our kids fascinated, especially getting to feed them is a bonus. Although it's a little walk away from the busy downtown Waikiki, we love the fact that HHV is a little away from all the peole and tall buildings downtown and it feels more relaxing and lay-back. Comparing to the nice 4/5 star hotels right in downtown Waikiki, we love the HHV much more because of the wide beach access and the bigger and more numerous pools we have at HHV. The local transit, the Bus, is very easy to access and it's just outside the HHV if you want to take the bus to the gigantic Ala Moana Shopping Mall. The down side of the HHV resort is the expensive restaurants, although the Benne Hanna Japanese restaurant is a great deal for lunch with tasty food cooked right in front of you with the skilled Japanese chef doing a very fun show, which our kids loved...don't forget to use the discount coupon in the coupon book inside your hotel room. We would stay at the HHV again next time we go back to Waikiki.

<Content>the place to be This is where the action is! Loved the nightly crab leg buffet at the Rainbow. The staff was helpful, and the atmosphere was awesome! Great fireworks on Friday night. Awesome for kids, as there are tons of animals. Don't be suprised the service anywhere in Hawaii is less than steller, but its because they are alledgedly a union and do not fear for their jobs??.. Get used to begging for refills anywhere that is not super pricey. Make sure to take a day trip to maui, and rent a car to explore the north shores, as we would have left honolulu missing out on so much!

<Content>Loved it I booked a Deluxe Ocean Front Room in Rainbow Tower for 4 nights as part of our honeymoon. Room was not high up (only on the 7th floor) but view was amazing, straight down Waikiki beach to the Diamond Head in the distance.Room itself was average balcony was good sized though. Main pool was fantastic, I did have a pool side massage which was also good. We grabbed a take away from one of the restaurants on property; the variety is fantastic, one night and settled on our balcony for the Friday fireworks.Over all a very good stay, whilst the Hilton wasn't our favourite hotel of the trip, Oahu was our favourite place! I recommend you hire a car and explore the sights of a truly amazing island.

<Content>Ali'i Tower - not up to expectations the Ali'i were royalty. At the Ali'i Tower, you'll experience superior luxury, subtle elegance and personalized services fit for kings and queens (Quote from Hilton Website)A case for misrepresentation I feel. Don't get me wrong I liked this hotel but our experience in general was the same as any other hotel in terms of service ... I certainly didn't feel like a queen! Just one of many ... :)This hotel is huge! We self-parked - easy. Check-In was smooth but the staff could have been friendlier ... the woman at the counter spent what about 10 minutes typing on the computer without saying a word to us ... not exactly a warm welcome. Our room wasn't ready so we went to the Ali'i Tower pool for lunch ... service was very very slow and my deli turkey sandwich wasn't well presented (basically a burger role with a mass of deli turkey shoved in the middle).Pool area was is smallish with comfy pool beds - there is a sign up saying that the beds are allocated on arrival and that you can't reserve them by leaving towels on them at the crack of dawn. A good idea we thought but it wasn't enforced (maybe they only do this in the busy season). Pool was fairly small but adequate for a quick dip to cool off. There is a hot tub too.Our room was on the 11 Floor and overlooked the main pool with a slight sea view (we had a good view of the Aloha Friday King's Jubilee  Fireworks). Room nothing to write home about ... average hotel room ... no complaints.We didn't eat dinners at the hotel (we had hoped to eat at the Village Steak Restaurant but it was closed). We got complimentary breakfast in the Tropics Cafe - bagels, banana bread, donuts, yogurts, fruit selection, juice - adequate for our needs.The hotel's main pool is larger (but cold) but the thing that put us off is the crammed in sun loungers - the hotel has put far too many in for people to be comfortable - unless you want to get up close and personal with a total stranger.The beach is steps away from the hotel and was nice. We also used the Lagoon - I didn't like this area as much.The hotel is a ten minute walk from busy shopping area (high end shops mixed with average joe's price range) and a number of restaurants. We enjoyed the stroll through the park over to the shops each evening. Overall this hotel is large with lots of people milling around but it does what it says on the tin and is a great location for Waikiki. Staff could be a bit friendlier and service in the Ali'i Tower needs to improve a lot before it's king and queen standard. I would still choose this tower though simply for the use of the Ali'i pool.

<Content>Great Stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village We just returned from a fantastic stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in a nice place in Hawaii. The room was very large and comfortable. There is a small bar fridge in the room that you can buy cold drinks/water and keep in there. The hotel is lovely and clean. We were upgraded to a room in the rainbow tower which is the one closest to the beach. Some of the other towers are a little further back, but I would stay in any of them. We were there in April, I think this might have been a less busy time in Waikiki, but there were plenty of pool lounge chairs available at any time of day. The beach right out in front of the hotel has plenty of room (unlike the main part of Waikiki beach which is very busy and constantly has people walking by you.) The ocean was very enjoyable but we did walk down the beach sometimes and went in the water in front of the Royal Hawaiian (the pink hotel) and found that when we went in the water the sand was much softer than at our part of the beach. Not a big deal at all, but it was nice some days to have that soft sand in between your toes!!! As I said, this part down by the pink hotel is VERY busy so I always enjoyed going back to the more quiet part of the beach in front of the Hilton. On Friday nights at around 7:30-8:00 they have a little show and fireworks display which was kind of fun to see.  Our flight didn't leave until 9pm but we had to check out at 11am. We gave our suitcases to the bellhop and were able to put all our valuables (wallet, passports, jewelry etc) in the safety deposit box at the front desk. This was great because we didn't have to worry about our bag getting stolen at the beach with all of our valuables in it while we were in the ocean.  As far as restaurants in Waikiki, we really enjoyed Dukes and the cheesecake factory. If you are going to either of these, I suggest you make a reservation for both as they are very busy. We only waited 5 minutes with a reservation and the couple beside us said they were told it would be about a 50 minute wait. If you are looking for a quiet romantic spot to have drinks and appetizers at night I highly recommend the patio at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.  Hope any of this helps and have a wonderful time!

<Content>Vegas-sized hotel in Hawaii We spent a 4 day spring break here early this month on a somewhat last minute package through Pleasant Holidays. Although this was our first stay here, I had explored the grounds on a prior HI visit. Unlike outer islands with their large resort properties, space is at a premium in Waikiki--most hotels are like urban hotels excepts with better views. I chose HHV because it has the most acreage and has a larger beach than central Waikiki, a larger main pool, a lagoon, plus lots of shops and restaurants.This is probably the largest hotel in Waikiki--3000 or so rooms in 5 towers, plus a time share tower and another one being built. It's like a Las Vegas hotel, except everything is real and outdoors, and there's no casino, but there are flamingos, penguins and koi. Needless to say, the place is quite crowded. Public areas, however, are well landscaped and maintained. HHV has its own ABC and Louis Vuitton stores and post office. It's not the place for peace and quiet or solitude, but neither is Waikiki in general.The beauty of Oahu is that is has the bustling metropolis of Honolulu with its shopping, dining, nightlife, culture and Pearl Harbor, plus the north, east and west shores with their myriads of quiet, scenic beaches, surfing and outer island feel.The check-in area always had a line--you can save time if your a HHonors member. Our rooms were in the Diamond Head Tower--the least expensive, shortest, oldest tower. I felt lucky we were able to even see the ocean from the lanai. The rooms were quite basic, housekeeping average. There was a small fridge and a coffeemaker, but no coffee pot.  Service on the whole was not too friendly--it's as if the employees are numbed by the large number of guests. We mostly ate off-site because the hotel's restaurants are on the expensive side, and we like to go where the locals go.The beach, while large, is quite coarse in areas, and an offshore breaker means minimal waves--too calm for some. The main pool was large by Waikiki standards but not particularly fancy. The only jacuzzi was at the smaller Kalia Tower pool. The hotel is on the western edge of Waikiki, which is an easy 10 minute walk away along the beach. The Ala Moana mall is a longer walk in the other direction.All in all, a good choice for Waikiki because there's a lot of activities for kids and adults. Just don't expect a highly personal experience (the upgraded Alii Tower may be different). I would recommend renting a car for at least part of the trip to easily access Pearl Harbor, Diamond Head, and the North Shore.My favorite hotel in Waikiki remains the Halekulani with its superior service and calm, quiet grounds. It is more expensive, however, and the beach there is almost nonexistent.

<Content>Rip-off Central Simply put, they rip you off, bad. Parking is $22.50 per day, for hotel guests. Visitors pay $84 per day. A Cheeseburger and Coke costs $35. To work out once, costs $14. Internet costs $10 an hour. Wetbar is empty. Breakfast not included. Enjoy!The parking fee's alone justify a 1 star review. The arrogance required for the hotel staff to have sat down at some point... and agreed that its okay to charge visitors $84 per day... and hotel guests $22 per day... tells me that they are intentionally taking advantage. Parking isn't the only problem...The $22 cheeseburger is met with an additional 17% service fee. On top of that they charge a $6.00 .... per person.... cover charge. On top of that they charge sales tax. By the time they were done, my cheeseburger with coke cost $35.00. Thank goodness I hid my girlfriend under the bed. My burger would have cost $41. Oh wait, it did cost $41... because I tipped the lady. Because she told me the hotel, in its infinite greed, does not give them the 17% service fee. Its part of the whopping $7.00 per hour they pay her. At age 45. Nice.There are no complimentary water bottles in the room. There's a wetbar (and mini fridge) but its completely empty. If you have a rental car, they force you to park in their parking garage at $22 a day. There is nowhere else to park. They have a fitness center, but they charge you $14 per visit to use it. There is nowhere else to work out. They have internet through the television, but it costs $10 an hour. They have no Wifi. Haha!The room does not come with breakfast. Nothing is included. The cheeseburger took over an hour to make. The delivery person told me they have 3,000 rooms and only one small kitchen. She said they once charged a room of 10 people an additional $60 cover charge for their food. The elevator roars like its about to fall apart. The door on the inside is a dark, stale, rusting steel sheet. The beds are amazing. You will sleep like a baby, but only if you aren't under anyone else. Three kids in the room above, jumping up and down kept me awake. Front desk staff acted annoyed, as other reviews here reveal. Changed rooms and ended up with a sliding glass door that creeked every time the wind blew. Four star hotel? Slept with the door open to avoid its movement and noise due to the wind. On its own merits, this hotel might warrant a 3 star rating. However, the crappy elevators, the rickety sliding doors, and the thin floors all show a general lack of attention to detail. A lack of attention that the hotel has no excuse for, given the outlandish fee's they charge for everything. If this place were plated in gold, I would give it a 3 star review despite all the extra charges. But... it's not.

<Content>Terrible Experience This is a terrible hotel. It takes forever to get the check-in done. They placed me to a worst room ever! It was right in front of the elevator, which made a huge noise. The staff at the check-in was rude and impatient most of the times. The breakfast was overpriced, with very low quality food. The room is very old, which could be rated at 3 star at best. This is one of my worst experience ever in a Hilton hotel. If you want to pay the same price, stay in Hilton Price Kuhio. The location is not as prime as the HHV, however, the facilities and services are definitely 10 times better! The only good thing about the HHV is that it has a lot of flamingos, penguins, and ducks. But you can just stay in other hotel and visit it as a zoo for fun one day.

<Content>Great Stay, Great Service, Great Room and Great Hotel We stayed on the property using H.H. points. We were a bit concerned because of some of the reviews and the way they apparently treated others using frequent stay points however, our stay was just great. We were there for nine great days. The hotel upgraded our room to a 25th floor, corner room with a great view of the ocean, beach, and Waikiki strip.The people were friendly, courteous, and couldn't help us enough. We didn't leave until 9:00 P.M. our last day and they gave us another room so that we could shower and get ready for the air port. The food was phenomenal at the resort but a bit pricey as is all the food on the island.I really can't say enough good things about our stay. I would recommend this to hotel to anyone, it has the best beach on Waikiki and the best amenities. We had the kids with us on the trip and they were so happy it was a great trip.Kudos to the staff for keeping up a great hotel. The rooms are clean and well cared for each day!Thanks Hilton Staff!

<Content>Lovely hotel in beautiful Hawaii Stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village from April 1st to April 7th, 2008. We chose it for the locaton and because it had the largest pool around. It is huge and is a city unto itself. If you like to shop at high-end stores, then this is the place for you. There are thousands of guests at this hotel at any one time, and it is very busy and crowded. Our hotel room was clean and well appointed. The beds were comfy and it was no problem getting extra pillows. One problem: the birds were overly friendly and came right inside the room. It was amusing for a day or so, until they decided to poop all over the lanai. We were upgraded to an ocean view room at no extra charge. We could definately see the ocean, however, we could also see the parking garage, the sidewalk, and the other tall buildings. The walk to the pool and the beach was lengthy, so be sure you are ready to parade around the grounds in your wet swim suit. Took a drive around the Island, which is a good idea so you do not think that this entire island is paved. Yes, there are some remote and wild areas out there beyond Waikiki Beach!

<Content>Not a bad place- just not our thing..... Greetings!Stayed at HHV w/my spouse (we are in our early 30's) and my parents (early 50's) for a week at the end of March. We stayed in the Tapa tower (26 floor) and they they Alii tower (8th floor).I knew from the get go- from reading the helpful advice on this site- that this place was a zoo-- but I was there for a conference which was headquartered there w/a decent room rate, so this was the easiest place to stay. Although the grounds are quite nice, this place was waaaaay too crowded for us. We actually considered checking out and moving to the Marriott out of town, but didn't want to pay the early check out. We all agreed that we would never consider staying here again, unless you had a few small kids in tow or something. We basically left every day (all day) in our rental car to enjoy the beauty of the island, and hang out its other amazing beaches (FAR better then Waikiki). I feel quite sad for people who don't leave this mega resort-- as they see such a small slice of Oahu!Pros--Location on Waikiki- some people find it removed, but I enjoyed it much more then the downtown area that was swarming with tourist traffic and a ton of shopping.-The rooms were fine, and pretty quiet which was surprising considering the volume of people there. (Not 4 star by any means though)-The ABC store on property --cheap alcohol, snacks, t-shirts, etc.-Pretty grounds, very friendly staff.Cons--Too crowded. Main pool had stadium seating of pool chairs 5 rows DEEP to the pool! Yuk! We only used the Alii pool- and it too was smashed and crowded.-The beach. I admit, we are beach snobs...but the beach in that area (and most of Waikiki from what we heard) is VERY rocky. The water is clear and calm, but we much preferred the soft sand of every other beach on the island-The food on site was not good. Typical bad overpriced resort fare- after trying 3 places for 2 lunches and a dinner we gave up and went to many great places offsite.-Because we live in the NYC area- we didn't find the prices in Hawaii to be bad at all---but the HHV charges just got SILLY- example- eggs benedict $21, a nature tour of the property $25 per person, room services charges crazy prices plus a $6 per person set up fee, 17% gratut., and of course tax. (So you eggs benedict would be $30)...I could go on and on.....($22 parking....)Thanks to the great advice here- we had some of our beach cocktails down at the military hotel next door ($4 as opposed to the HHV's $9 for a mixed drink)-- and got some cheap food there as well ($3.75 for a burger at lunch as opposed to the HHV's $13 burger). We also took advantage of the beach chair and umbrella rental right past that hotel-- 1/2 the price of the HHV ($60 per day!)We had excellent dinners at the Ocean House, and Singha (sp?) the Thai place--great dinners at the Shorebird and Dukes-- good (and cheap) breakfasts at the Wailea Coffee Shop-- and awesome lunches at Teddys Burgers and a little sushi joint in the same plaza.Again- we will return, but we won't be staying at the HHV!

<Content>Impressive Grounds This Hilton property is very impressive and huge. There is heaps to do, shops, loads of pools, boarders onto the beach, bars resturants, free live shows by the pool - it has everything. Staff and Service: I found to be top notch, staff actually looked like they enjoyed working there. Everyone was helpful and friendly and all request were met. Room: Alright, I guess not as good as I had hoped for which I find often happens under the Hilton name. However it was clean and comfortable with everything I needed. I also expected it to be bigger.I probably wouldn't stay here again as there are just better options for singles, under 30's etc for the same price. However this would be a perfect property for familys and older travellers.

<Content>Disappointed by the service The Hilton Hawaiian Village is a lovely property in a central location. We were there for a conference and planned to stay following the close of the conference for vacation. We stayed in the Alii tower.The positives:Everything available onsiteLovely exterior propertyThe housekeeping staffBeautiful beach (but crowded)Bell staffThe negatives:Front desk staff at Alii towerAtypical charges (there is a charge to use the room safe)Rooms are adequate only; not 3 or 4 star levelSelf parking (due to the size of the resort)I contacted the hotel directly to make reservations; assuming this would create less room for error. I was assured I would receive an oceanview room (not partial oceanview) with 2 double beds. On check-in, we were assigned a partial oceanview room directly across from the elevator. We informed the front desk staff person that we were assured an oceanview room and she was less than accomodating, emphasizing the excellent rate we had received for the room because of the conference and informing us how fortunate we were to be there for that rate. We were traveling with children, ages 2 and 6. I specifically asked not to be placed near any ice machines or elevators. Our partial oceanview room had no view of the ocean, unless you leaned over the balcony and twisted yourself virtually in-half. After sitting around and waiting for someone to help us, we eventually ended up in an oceanview room with king bed (we were told a king bed was all we could have).We decided to leave this hotel as soon as the conference ended. Front desk staff ignored us when we walked by (holding their own conversations). We were particularly disappointed because thie Alii tower was supposed to be the HIlton's best tower.Because we left early we were supposed to pay a $100 cancellation fee, however we did get the management to waive the fee. We were particularly disappointed overall because my spouse is a Hilton Honors members and has been loyal to the hotel for business travel. This is a good hotel for persons who like lots of activity (or congestion depending on how you interpret it). The penguins, flora, and grounds are lovely. There are many shops and restaurants to choose from. For context, we typically stay in Four Seasons (e.g., Great Exuma, Nevis), Ritz Carlton (e.g., Palm Beach, Amelia Island), Rosewood Resorts (St. John) for personal travel so we have high expectations. Hilton Hawaiian does not remotely compare (we did not expect it to; but we did expect better than it provided). It is a 3 star property at best. We left and went to the JW Marriott Ihilani -- WONDERFUL! If you want rest, helpful staff, attention to detail -- go to JW Marriott.

<Content>No Cost Parking Options!! Just returned from 10 days at the HHV and since I gained valuable information from these reviews I thought I'd add one important one I never read. The daily parking charges are very high and I actively sought alternatives. I found a great one. Behind the large lagoon type swimming pool, directly behind the Rainbow Tower on the ocean side, there is a large parking lot that beach goers, employees, and those in-the-know use daily at no charge. We parked out there every evening and had no problems whatsoever. Depending on which Tower you are staying at, the walk to your room is probably closer from there then the costly parking lot. This saved us almost $200 in fees.Use it and save!!!

<Content>Great Place We loved this property! The only downside was the lengthy line at check-in. After traveling for most of the day, we were dying to get to our room, and it took nearly an hour to get our keys. The facility has many food choices. The pool was wonderful and the lagoon was very nice. The room size was adequate, but the view was breathtaking from the high floors of the Rainbow Tower. If you stay there, go to Eggs n'things for breakfast a few blocks away. Outstanding! and it helps with the budget. The kids loved the birds and fish and penguins --a great place for families.

<Content>Great location We just had a one night stay (after our 1 week stay on the Big Island) before our long flight home to Chicago. This place is busy! We arrived on Friday 3/28/08. I am really glad our stay was on the night thay have the weekly Kings Jubilee Celebration.If I had known how nice the show was I would have saved some money but seeing that free show instead of a luau.Fireworks after show can be seen from the SuperPool where the show is held, the beach or from our ocean view room! Lynn at the front desk was very friendly and made us feel very welcome there. Our room was clean and no housekeeping problems. Beautiful view from the 24th floor of the Rainbow Tower. Rooms with odd numbers have a view of the ocean, Diamond Head and Waikiki. Lots of shopping on site. Would recommend this hotel if you don't mind lots of excitement, people and walking on your trip. If you are looking for peace, quiet and seclusion on your Hawaiian vacation this place is not for you.

<Content>Overated and overpiced! Staff (except for a few exceptions) were rude and could care less about the guests. Concierge always acted bothered when we asked questions and rushed through the answers, tour/activities desk the same, and the front desk and guest services were completely unhelpful. It took forever to check in - we had just spent 15 hours traveling - and all we wanted to do was take a shower but there was no shower curtain! We called guest services who said someone would be right there. A maid showed up about 30 minutes later, handed me the shower curtain, and took off fast so as not to have to do anything else. I had to teeter on the edge of the bath tub to put it up - INSANITY, but i could have cared less at the time because it was 5 am my time and I wasn't about to wait another 30 minutes for someone else. The bed was right next to the door so we were woken up every night by hall noise, and we were two doors away from the ice machine (and people were getting ice at all hours of the night). But I should note we saw other rooms, which were set up differently. ALL food and drink at this establishment is overpriced! Bad food and extremely expensive. Breakfast was $26 per person, hot dogs at the casual restaurant on the beach were $11, all drinks $4, and even the other restaurants on site were awful and overpriced (like the Italian restaurant). Not an easy walk to other restaurants, have to cab it every where. There is a trolley stop by the hotel which can take you several places though. And a bus stop too. And there are a few convenience stores on site, but crowded and expensive.Also, we think there might have been bed bugs as we both ended up with unexplained rashes. I see other people have said the same thing. There are several towers there and we stayed in the Tapa tower.Beach was ok, we ended up driving to much nicer ones though.They messed up on our bill and tried to brush us off about it. I kept at it until it was corrected, then when we checked out there was another problem with our bill. The whole thing was a mess.The one thing we liked was the flamingos, parrots, penquins, ducks, and other birds they have on site.Bottom line - stay somewhere else!!!

<Content>Generally good experience In general, the Hilton Hawaiian Village is an impressive property. The grounds are beautiful, with koi ponds, exotic birds, and even warm climate penguins on the property. Great beachfront location. Staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Shuttle service (for a fee, various companies) from the hotel makes it easy to get around to area attractions. The conference center and the Ala Moana shopping center are within reasonable walking distance. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Bedding was very comfortable though different from what I'm used to...no top sheet but a sheet/duvet combo that was a nice weight and seemed to regulate tempature well. Sheets and towels were of good quality and ample supply. Stayed in the Rainbow Tower which has great views of Waikiki Beach. Room had a wet bar area with sink, counter space, and a small fridge. Coffee maker utilizes a coffee pod system, with 10% kona coffee blends provided. We made a run to Wal Mart (by the Ala Moana Center) for bagels, cream cheese, water, juice etc to keep in the fridge during our stay. Expect to pay higer prices on the resort for food and souveniers. The ABC store (food, drinks, sundries) had more reasonable prices however than some of the other locations. Stayed here as part of a conference and got great rates. I'd stay here again but not sure that the regular rates are within my budget. We did run into a problem during check in. We needed to charge the room to a different card than the one we used to hold the initial reservation. Though we were told that would be no problem, the charges were applied to the wrong card and resulted in a negative balance on our debit card. Fortunately the manager on duty was very helpful in rectifying the mistake and even comped a room night for our troubles. Also, we asked for a king room but got a double. We were told it was because we were with a conference but other attendees booked via the conference rate and were given king rooms.

<Content>No aloha in the service department Maybe it was just a busy time of year, right after Christmas and before New Year's, that the hotel attendants had a lot on their minds, but I didn't think it should've deterred from their responsibility to make guests feel welcome. I've traveled quite a bit and stayed at various deluxe and luxury hotels in Hawaii and Hilton hotels throughout the country and this one situated in Waikiki was not up to par. When we drove up to valet our car, there were 6 attendants just standing around and talking amongst each other when there were 3 cars in line to valet. After several minutes, I had to approach one attendant to help us. In other deluxe hotels, the valet attendants would be opening the passenger door as soon as the driver puts the gears on park. Then we were told tostand in line to register where we waited for 30 minutes to get our room and in the mean time, the bell boy was no where to be found. We went ahead to our room and waited another 30 minutes for our luggages to be sent up. After waiting in the long registry line, we were told that the partial ocean view room we requested were all booked and offered us a garden view which I promptly declined. We were then given an upgrade to an ocean view room for the price of the original room we requested.Our room overlooked the beautiful new man made lagoon which opened up on the day we arrived. My 2 young boys were quite excited to swim to the man made rock island with a waterfall in the middle of this lagoon. When they touched the bottom, instead of feeling the anticipated grainy sandy feeling, they felt a squishy, clay- like, muddy consistency which brought about a cloudy film in the water. It seemed unsanitary so we left for the beach about 50 yards away. There were positives: beautiful grounds with South African penguins, flamingos, parrots. The many shops and dining were all within the hotel premises. Many lounges with live music and entertainment. It's very close to the zoo, aquarium, and the biggest shopping mall in the Pacific, Ala Moana shopping center. Another positive is it's location- at the edge of Waikiki; not in the hustle and bustle section. Our room had a magnificent view and was a good size with a refrigerator.I would recommend making reservations at Hilton Hawaiian village during off peak season when it's not so crowded because despite the unfortunate service we encountered, it does have a lot to offer, especially families with kids.

<Content>Tapa Tower - 35th Floor - Loved It! Stayed at the Tapa Tower on the top floor, 35 floors up! We were treated very very well by the hotel front desk staff and the chambermaid. Each morning we received a newspaper at our door and fresh coffee.The resort is a bit out of the way, closer to the marina area of Waikiki and the Ola Moana Shopping Centre. We liked the fact that it was at the far end of the hotel strip. The resort is huge - and the shopping area in the resort is great. There's an ABC store right in the resort, very handy for all the sundries we needed.

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian Village We have stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village 4-5 times (both in the Lagoon Tower and Rainbow Tower) and have been very impressed with the location, accommodations and staff every time. One of the best things about the village is that you do not need a rental car since most of the tours pick up right at the village. However, if you want to drive around the island, you can rent a car right at the village. There are numerous restaurants (each one we have visited has been excellent) and shops in the village and the spa is great!

<Content>Not good at all! My husband and I stayed here for Valentine's week and were not happy at all with our stay. The room was unclean. Housekeeping was awful and NEVER cleaned anything. We put a pizza box in the trash which housekeeping REMOVED from the trash and placed on our bed. Our dirty glasses were not replaced and were actually flipped over on the tray for reuse. Coffee and coffee cups were NEVER replaced, even after complaining we could not get this done 100%. No trash was ever picked up- and we are neat people.The bathroom was filthy. I complained and it was marginally cleaned. At least the hair and crud was wiped off the toilet. It was a mess. Yes I did complain to mgmt who really did not care beyond an apology.The bed had no topsheet which I complained about. The housekeeper told me if I wanted a topsheet she would need to remove the comforter! I said I wanted to keep the comforter so she told me to put the sheet on myself. I am not kidding.The elevators took forever,sometimes 10 minutes in the morning, and there were no stairs we could take.We tried the Sushi place and wound up walking out when we were totally ignored for 15 minutes after being seated. Noone ever waited on us.We did much better venturing off the grounds and finding local restaraunts.We travel a lot and have never had such a letdown as this resort. Stay elsewhere!

<Content>Definitely give this place a go! For some reason, I was really surprised at what a fantastic hotel this was! The staff were very friendly considering the number of guests that they would attend to each day! The lobby is busy 24/7 and still manage to keep a smile on thier faces. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower (highly recommend) on the 27th floor with the most spectacular view of Waikiki, looking all the way down to Diamond Head) and is right on the beach. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable, and well above our expectations, considering what we had paid to stay there! I have paid far more to stay in other hotels in Waikiki that I would not stay at ever again. Shop around online.Of the many hotels that I have stayed at in Waikiki, I would without question, return back to the Hilton Village. There are lots of restaurants (Benihana's) and bars to choose from, with quick and easy access to the beach. Of course, plenty of ABC shops too!! haha! It is quite an enjoyable walk into downtown - about 10 minute walk, if that. There is always plenty happening! The only thing that I did not like was the Grand Vacation Time Share guys hassling you - they call you in your room, leave notes in your room.... go to the concerierge to ask a question and you get Have you heard about out Hilton Grand Vacation plan? - ENOUGH! I didn't go there to buy [-] Time Share! The other small thing was that the airport bus dropped us off in the bus area and wsa no where near where the lobby was. I thought of older and less fit travellers with bags, it is a long walk and no one there to assist you. I really enjoyed my stay there - good for just about any type of traveller.

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian is Beautiful and Spacious but..... We stay there during our Spring Break for 1 week. Hilton Hawaiian is at the far end and the beginning of the Waikiki Beach. Depending what you are looking for, it is quiet and relaxing when you stroll along Waikiki Beach. But if you are young and looking for excitement, then you should stay closer in the middle of Waikiki Beach where all the young people hang around such as Hyatt, Marriott. Expensive food in Hilton but there are many restaurants along Waikiki Beach that offer better price and don't forget to use the coupons!Go to ABC store for everything. I am very disappointed that Hilton does not have a warm pool or a hot tub. My children were freezing and reluctant to go for swimming. Otherwise, the weather is great there.

<Content>"Don't Bother With This Hotel!" If you have never been to Hawaii before, I do not recommend you stay here!I totally agree with 鈥楴ever Again鈥? I have been to Oahu over 20 times and have always wanted to stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Well, I finally got my chance when I received a special offer to check out their time share. At check-in, after waiting a long time in a long line, I found the staff was very indifferent and not friendly. They barely look at you and hardly give you eye contact. They could have cared less if I was there at all! The property is so big, it seemed only like a convention hotel 鈥?moving the guests in and out like cattle.The first room they gave me was very average and over-looked the roof of the shops. Even though I requested a non-smoking room, when I first walked in it smelled of smoke so I immediately had my room changed. They just gave me another very average room, also with no view at all. No apologies or mentioning any kind of better room. They didn鈥檛 seem to care that I was a prospect for purchasing one of their time shares.If you self-park, it is a mile to your room. And, if you want to walk to the center of Waikiki, you have a nice little hike ahead of you. The hotel is at the very beginning of Waikiki. There is nothing near the hotel to walk to - only the Wailana Coffee House across the street (which by-the-way has excellent food) or the Kobe Japanese Steak House with the little bears in front.I had a voucher for The Bali Hai restaurant. Otherwise I wouldn鈥檛 have eaten there because it was overpriced. But it was lovely. I had complained at the NY Deli, but the owner was in and he was very nice. The shops are over priced, as well. Other reviewers said there is an ABC store on the hotel grounds, but there are about 30 ABC鈥檚 in Waikiki alone!The smaller swimming pool is tiny and the big pool is just average.There are other better hotels in Waikiki, I can鈥檛 understand why the Hilton Hawaiian Village gets such rave reviews. It seems to me that some reviewers had never been to Hawaii before and this is their first impression of it, so they think the hotel is wonderful. If you want a great hotel, I suggest the Moana Surfrider, the Royal Hawaiian, the Outrigger or the Outrigger Reef. They are all in the price range of the Hilton. The Kahala Hotel is also a wonderful hotel, but it's around the other side of Diamond Head. If you really want something special and romantic, the only hotel to stay in is the Halekulani. In my opinion, it is the most grand and elegant hotel in Waikiki with superb service and a friendly, accommodating staff (no, I am not an employee, just a big fan!).Don鈥檛 bother with the Hilton Hawaiian Village.

<Content>Torture Nice room, but picked up bed bugs at this hotel. Once home, it was devastating. Extremely bad bites over my body, much money spent to exterminate these things and a complete disruption of my life. I will never stay at a hotel, whether it is the Ritz-Carlton or Hotel 6, without inspecting every corner of that bed and associated area. Of course, the Hilton is denying this, though they have been implicated in this problem earlier. Avoid the Hilton chain, but educate yourself and check other hotels with care.

<Content>more like a city than a village Ok...I live in hawaii...and its been a few years since I went to Honolulu...I got a outstanding rate which is why I stayed there I was even upgraded to the Rainbow tower. and am not a Hilton points member and over looked the boat harbor..which is the best location for restauraunts and pool access There is no smoking in the rooms or anywhere on the entire Hilton grounds and it is enforcedRoom had a small bath, nice bed...and a 30  flat screen sterioTo say it is a village is misleading as I dont know many villages anywhere that are comprised of 30 to 40 story buildings in all there are 4 with one 40 story tower ( condos) under construction and a 6 story parking garage and a shopping mall in every building plus the Rainbow Bazzar...a huge collection of non hilton shops and restauraunts....which I will ge to later.The majority of hotels and buildings in the area all run well over 30 storiesIt reminded me of New York or down town San Francisco...if they had palms.It has a big metropolitan city feel....with a tiny touch of Hawaii...very tiny. it can take 20 min to walk one way across the grounds and will take over an hour to walk around....huge.2 of the towers are concierige towers and have their own private pool....which were the same size as mine at home......Living in Kona... it was funny to realize that with 5000+ rooms and who knows how many condos...and staff( 600 in just housekeeping) ther there were more people in tha hilton than in the town of Kailua Kona and Keauhou together. well over 15,000Traffic was 24 -7 parking costs $22 a day self park and $29 valet It is not a place to get away from the world... I took a cab...$30 fron the airport. Roberts shuttle $9 pp.The pool was a rather normal pool...that was packed from 8 am to 6pm when it closed. ..with ever size shape and age andnationality .... I thought Icaught a glimpse of Osama Bin laden talking to Hitler.... it was that diverse .The grounds were manicured and totaly clean, the staff excellent and efficient and plesant... the beach ....marginal the water somewhat mirky and the kids lagoon...was beautiful but nothing more than a sand bottom swimming pool.. it was mirky as well.Everything...is for sale....or rent....for a price. Itr is very easy to spend double your room.. $80 for 2 for a simple breakfast coffee 2 eggs, a meat, hash browns and toast.... The buffet was about $30 pp..... Dinner Buffet runs about $35 per person 18 kids...thats any living breathing kid under 12. The restauraunts all start alacarte at 35 to 50 a plate.....I talked to several guests ant they told me that dinner ran them arounf $200 a night. with drinks. Speaking of drinks my wife and I had 4 frozen maitais and 5 pot stickers and 4 spring rolls for about $60. at a beach bar. SInce My credit card has only a mid range 5 figure credit, I did not order room service..... (and the mini bar require a written contrat....with payment terms and a down payment min.)Here are some room service prices I took for fun: ( inclludes tax ans service charges)14 chicken pizza...$47......Mai Tahi for one...$20.521/2 a chicken with fries..$33.Cheess burger with fries...$31.NY steak.... $57.Bottled water r soft drink $5.Pancakes (3)$28.Case of beer ( 24) budwiser... $133.......So I went looking and found this fantastic place in the Rainbow Bazzar......CJ's a classiic NY style deli-dinner meets hawaii....It had a fun happy staff, was family run not a chain....and prices 60% lower than the Hilton.....portions so huge you could not finish. We had breakfast for 2...huge the works...home made hash. 8 oz of it..3 eggs, toast, coffee, hash browns.. sliced tomators, tip tax... for under $35....... Dinner was the same... we ended eating 90%of all our meals there......it was exceptional in every respect.Over all felt sorry for people who, the staff told me never left the hotel for a week..... They also related that our own Hilton on the island of Hawaii was their favorite......total different feel .Check out was a breeze and everything went smooth..... only caution is food..... go to CJ's

<Author>SouthCarolinaCynic
<Content>Mixed Opinion We are currently at the Hotel in the Diamond Head Tower. The rooms are reasonable in terms of size and cleanliness. We have adjoining rooms with a door between them which is a good way to go when travelling with teenagers.The resort is pleasant with a variety of pools and a nice beach. My 13 year old son was shocked to find there was no arcade.Prices are very high. It was $14 the other day for chicken tenders and fries. Don't even consider room service unless you have a seven figure income. Parking is $22/day for self park and $26/day for valet. We took the valet but found they won't let you call down to get the car ready. You have to actually come to the valet stand before they will get your car. They usually have it within a couple fo minutes though. I have never understood why inexpensve hotels can offer internet access for free but expensive places charge for it. I paid $65 for 5 days access, about as fas as dial up. There are dozens of stores and places to eat on the property which is actually pretty nice. If you want to charge something to your room account though they have to physically call the hotel to approve the charge. It is extremely inefficient.The hotel services are average. I have called the guest services hotline a few times. Two of those times no one ever answerred. I just got put in to that endless loop of recordings saying how important my call was. When I did get through they were pleasant and helpful.IThe primary purpose of the concierge desk, as far as can tell, is to try to get people to sign up for the time share sales pitch.If you don't mind the price of the food, it isn't bad.

<Content>Never Again My recent experience at the Hilton Hawaiin Village has left me cold on any future booking with the Hilton resort chain.Upon arriving, after a long overseas trip, I was confronted with a long wait at check in, after having to carry my own bags as the bellmen were too busy chatiing with each other. The check in clerk was hopeless. Either very under trained or plain incompetent. Could not find my reservation, could not find a room, and had to check with her supervisor several times. I asked for a early check in, at 10:00 am (check in is at 2;00pm)and they insisted on charging me a full nights stay, even though she admitted they were only at 70% capacity. I was so tired I paid very reluctantly. I am a hilton honours member since 1982.The hotel itself is unremarkable, and I have stayed at some of the best resorts around the world, and I have difficulty understanding why some rank this resort highly, other than they may not have had many other experiences.The location is right at the end of the beach, not the best in my opinion. This is a large resort with a huge amount of people, so if you are looking for an intimate holiday forget. Get in line with a cast of thousands for everything. And as another reviewer has commented don't try to get a drink after 11:00pm, all bars are closed, including the beach bar that closes at 8:30PM! . Room service told me to walk down to the local liqour vendor if I wanted a beer after 11:00.The rooms a typically Hiltonesque. Comfortable and reasonably modern, but no wow factor which you might expect at a resort. Balcony was very dirty. The pools are very small compared to most hotels of this size, and the beach really over crowded. Forget about the romantic sunsets, unless you don't mind a view across a breakwater and parking lot. Surfing is hard here as well due to the long paddle required to get to the break and shallow coral, making it dangerous for beginers.The restaurants are completely uninspiring, for the exception of Bali which we enjoyed a good but overpriced meal, with no resembalance to the cusine of its name sake island. The Italian restaurant is a utter disappointment, the New York Deli very average. The main restaurant where you are herded for breakfast, and then oversold on the unbelievable buffet at $28 was a disaster. Lack of variety, presentation and importantly quality. The onsite shopping gallery is very overpriced and a tourist trap. Save time and money and grab a cab to the premium DFO about a $50 cab ride away.I found most of the staff uninterested, and not particularily friendly, except for a couple of the girls in the beach bar. Maybe they were happy because they were off at 8:30 every night!!!When I checked out of the hotel I again was met by rude and disinterested staff. When I suggested her politley that an improvement in attitude might improve customer retention. I was instructed to go see the duty manager he might listen. He doesn't need to now as I won't be back. In summary, I truly see little redeeming qualities in this Hilton property, and believe there are infinatelyy better choices available for discerning travellers. Spend your money elsewhere, you will be glad.

<Content>A 'True' Review After reading many reviews on this campus, my wife and I are ready to give it to you straight... This hotel campus is awesome for starters. We'll give you the do's and don'ts. The plush tower is the Ali'i; however, they don't participate in the Hilton Honors program so don't expect to get upgraded to this tower. What makes this tower so fantastic are the following: Very nice wooden pool side chairs with pillows. Fitted towels for the pillows on the lounge chairs All the towels you would ever need while sunbathingThe pool is located on the second floor and has a nice whirlpool as well as a fantastic view of the beach and ocean. The very nice fitness center right off the pool complete with free weights and cardio machines. The pool side bar is where you can enjoy your breakfast, lunch, and 5 p.m. complimentary snacks. The staff is fabulous. This is a private pool and is only for people staying in the Ali'i tower and their guests. The Rainbow Tower is the second best tower in our opinion due to the fabulous view. You can use your points here and we recommend trying to get a dual balcony room over looking the ocean/lagoon or ocean/pool. We stayed in R2800 after leaving the Ali'i and used our points. The view can't be described it was so beautiful. We awoke each morning to a beautiful rainbow. The elevator ride can take a little time but you're in a big hotel and it happens. The other 4 towers: Kalia, Tapa, Diamond head and Lagoon (time shares) are dealers choice. Kalia is nice as far as having in our opinion the best pool. The super pool located by the ocean gets very crowded and the chairs are touching one another. Kids love it but if you want a little privacy go to the 4th floor pool at the Kalia tower. Nice water fall and not real populated. The fitness center located here (4th floor) is awesome. Large windows with a balcony that face Diamond Head and the facility has everything you would want. The Spa is also located in this tower. Gold and Diamond members can use the fitness center at no charge. Tapa tower from what we were told by people we met is not the tower to stay in if you want a beautiful romantic view. There is a pool located by the Tapa tower that is also not too heavily populated and is a nice area to relax. Diamond Head if you're on the side facing Diamond Head gives you a nice view, other than that not too much. Let's now address where to eat and shop on the Hilton Campus. We never left except to drive to North Shore, which we'll address later. GO TO THE ABC store on campus to purchase your drinks, booze, snacks, suntan lotion, etc..... KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS... They give you a gift when you leave based on what you spent. We received 2 very nice coffee mugs for our $257.00. Prices are very reasonable and after you purchase a view drinks at the bar (cokes, etc) you'll understand. There is a Starbucks located on the 1st floor of the Kalia tower. This is the fastest Starbucks we've ever been to; however, Lappert's located directly across from the main check in area has fabulous coffee and ice cream. They also give you a card and after 10 purchases (ice cream or coffee) you'll recieve one free. There Kaui Pie coffee is to die for. Pricing for the specialty coffee is the same as Starbuck's but you can't get the Kaui Pie and you at least get one free after 10 purchases. There is also another grocery type store located in the shopping area by the Diamond Head Tower, they have a nice selection with good pricing as well. Don't do the Rainbow Lanai dinner buffet. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL..... Use your coupon books that you get at check in. They have great deals at all the shops on campus. 10% off to free items. When you go to claim your free gift on the scratch off card with the penguin, be ready for a time share pitch.. You'll have to go to a sales pitch but it's worth it. Listen, it's not for everyone but we may end up doing it. Plus you get $100 hilton honor bucks that can be used at several shops. This campus is not cheap or inexpensive, remember your going to Hawaii.. But, if you take time to check everything out you'll find that you can have a blast and not have to spend $80.00 per meal. Use the coupon's they offer from food, car rental, clothing and coffee it saves you money. If you're going to sun yourself on the beach you can rent lounge chairs and umbrellas or just use the Free towels they have. (remember to ask for 2 per person.) Get a car and tour the island. North Shore was cool and we recommend going to the Turtle Bay Resort for breakfast or lunch. It's a cool get away and a nice location right on the ocean. We used Hertz (Tapa Tower) and if you book on-line you get a discount plus your coupon book has a $5.00 off voucher. The staff was awesome, we felt like everyone wanted us at the hotel and we will be back next year. Here is a sample of what we spent per day: (2 people)Breakfast: Free for Gold/Diamond members (get voucher at check in)Lunch: $14 to $45 depending what you want . Bar/Grill(awesome hot dog shop in Rainbow tower)Dinner: $40-$115 We used a Limo service to pick us up and take us back to the airport. We used ABC Limo Service: [-]Email: [-] Melvin Kim (owner) picked us up and we highly recommend using him. He waited for us over 45 minutes due to our flight getting in late. We walked up to baggage claim and there he was... He told us to be ready at 2:00p.m. for our ride back to the airport and he was very promptly on time with refreshments during our drive. FIRST CLASS!!!!We hope this helps, we used this site to pick this destination and read some great comments and also read the complainers... In a nut shell. For a beautiful fun filled trip this is your hotel for couples or the whole family!! Aloha Kev and Jen

<Content>Great experience again My wife and I just returned from our trip to Hawaii where we stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. This was my second time at this hotel and my wife's first and we were both impressed. The rooms were clean and well-maintained throughout the five days we stayed there. The hotel complex has anything you could possibly want there: convience store, various other stores, restaurants, etc, although prices for all items have the typical Waikiki premium associated with them. The restuarants that were actually part of the hotel, particularly the Rainbow Lanai, served some really good food for breakfast and dinner (didn't try lunch there).The thing that I like the most about the Hilton Hawaiian Village was its location. Located at the beginning of Waikiki (the part closest to the airport/downtown Honolulu), it is easier to access than other hotels since you don't have to deal with all of the traffic congestion associated some of the other hotels, like Outrigger and the Royal Hawaiian. Also, there is a little less traffic on the beach, making for a much more enjoyable experience. All in all, I would definately recommend staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for your next trip!

<Content>Great Family Destination It always surprises me when I look at previous reviews. It's amazing how travelers can have such different experiences at the same resort.Our family stayed at the HHV March 9th - 14th. We booked a gardenview in the Ali'i tower and were upgraded to an oceanview room during check-in. The process was smooth, there were no issues with our room type and there was no wait. The Ali-i tower was perfect for our family as it was close to the beach, had it's own fitness room, and overlooked the pool. We loved everything about this resort - the beachwalk, on-site restaurants, shopping and the wildlife. We found it to be relaxing and fun - I was able to read by the pool and the kids found lot's of other children to play with on the beach.The superpool was colder than I expected and the lifeguards do a good job keeping the area calm - they do not allow sport balls or inflatables in the main pool so most of the activity occurs at the adjacent beach. There was no problem finding a lounge chair, maybe because most of the pool area is in the shade until mid-morning. In late afternoon, there is great local music at the Tropics bar which is outside and overlooks the beach area. Most afternoons were spent there or at the Ali'i pool where you could enjoy appetizers and look out over the beach.The resort if off the main strip and it takes about 15 minutes to walk to a more central area. We normally walked to dinner and then cabbed it home (in hindsight, we probably should have done the opposite!). At departure, we were able to schedule time in the hospitality room so we could clean up before heading out - this is rare as most hotels do not let you pre-schedule this room. Housekeeping was great and left lot's of chocolate and bottled water at turn down.Other Pros:beachfront, no wait for cabs, ABC, Starbucks and bookstore on site, backs to the beachwalk path, quick poolside bar sericeCons: The Ali'i fitness area needs to be a bit cooler- it gets too hot. Also, the Hertz office on-site needs more flexible hours and additional staff during the morning rush.This resort was perfect for our family and we will return

<Content>Very Disappointed I have just returned from this Hotel and the experience was very disappointing.As a resort I would expect that they would have bars and restaurants open late. The latest bar closes at 10pm and it was impossible to get dinner past 8pm at night.The rooms were comfortable but they are extremely noisy from slamming doors and elevators.Most of the staff were helpfull but had no suggestions on what to do after the 8pm cut-off for dinner.On the morning of check out there was no hot water for a shower and the wake up call asked for was not done.

<Content>Worst Experience in Years We were a group of businessmen staying at this Hotel for 4 days for various business meetings. We had travelled from various parts of the world but mainly from the USA and Australia. Everything is bad about this hotel. We booked and extra night as we were not arriving untill 6am the following morning. On arrival they had cancelled all our rooms as no Shows even though they had been advised of the early booking of the rooms and the reason why. The check in staff are so poorly trained one of our party took 40mins to check in even thought we were all Hilton Club members. In addition to this the staff are rude. My room was OK but I had a dripping toilet for the 4 days I was there. I kept expecting housekeeping to report it each day and yet it was never fixed. Wake up calls came through on times different to what I ordered. You can not get a drink in the hotel after 11pm at night as all bars and restaurants are closed. Ridiculous for a so called resort. On the Sunday evening half the restaurants are closed so it was difficult to get a meal. My balcony was never cleaned during my visit. We were all charged different rates and our rooms were spread out on various floors in different buildings. This whole terrible experience will make me reconsider ever using a Hilton Hotel again and I would not recomend this Hotel to anyone either for business or pleasure. It is a poor value for money proposition

<Content>Can"t Wait to Go Back Just returned to Canada and miss the surf and beach at the Hilton already. I am writing this review because I research trip advisor routinely for all the trips that we take and I find the reviews informative. I always evaluate the tips and use the information at our destinations to find the best excursion, restaurants, shopping, etc. Hope this review assists you in making your decision about the Hilton in Oahu.The hotel complex is massive and amazing. We were truly delighted to be there and enjoyed the facility. STaff are friendly, helpful, and there is a lot to enjoy. The problem is cramming everything in before you have to return home. We loved the exotic wildlife, the waterfalls, the shopping, the floral gardens, the entertainment that is on site.and the tours that were arranged for us by the staff. In addition, great location to take city busses, or walk to Waikki beach. The bus stop is just out front of the property. We used the tour desk on site to book tours and they were excellent. We went to the Arizonza Memorial 4 hour tour which gave us a tour of the city and the Punchbowl Cemetary. Tour guides were friendly and informative. If you have the opportunity go with cousin Paul, he was amazing with the ALoha tour group. ,Did the whale watching tour with ATlantis which included the lunch. It was OK. if you have not seen whales before. We have ,so it was not a huge exciting trip but well worth it for 62 dollars each which included a nice buffet lunch. Kids on board loved the action and we enjoyed the view of the hotels from the water. Whale sitings are guarenteed or your money is returned. Also rented a convertable to tour the entire island on one day, and that was amazing to say the least. DO IT and you will not regret signing up for a bus tour . We stopped many times, saw the whales, the surfers on the north shore, Visited the pine apple plant, a few bars and some shopping along the way completed the day. Having our own transportation made it so easy to pick and choose where we wanted to stop and sight see and how long we wanted to stay at one particular spot was up to us and not a tour operator. Car cost 55 dollars with Hertz for 24 hours and we booked it on site. It was a deal for the day because we took it as is, and not cleaned. It was still emaculate and ready to go, with our bathing suits packed and a few snacks we were on our way. What a day!WEather was fantastic, lots of sun by the pool and beach, and lots of entertainment to choose from. The tropic bar was our pick every day from 3 p.m.on into early evening. Local talent was great. The Friday evening show was exceptional, the lei making classes were fun, we even did the timeshare tour and were not hassled when we declined. Check out the deal if you sign up. It worked really well for us. HIgh end and low end shopping if you want is within walking distance and particularly at night along Lewers street is fun. Hotel room was very large complete with alll the amenities you could wish for. If you needed anything extra just ask and you shall receive immediately. Be patient with housekeeping if you want your room cleaned before noon, as it is a large facility but it always get done.Being Canadians we took our own TIm HOrtons coffee and filters and it worked each morning for us on our balcony. We quickly figured out how to make a two cup individual cup coffee maker work to our advantage. The hotel supplies individual cup servings of Kona coffee that just don't cut it when we are used to our own Tims Brew. If you choose there is a STar Bucks on site in one of the buildings that on some days we went to just to sit by the many waterfall areas. What a way to enjoy a cup of coffee. We stayed in the Diamond Head building overlooking the garden and one of the five pools. It was great. WAlked every morning along the beach with our coffee thermos cups and watched the most incredible sunrises and sunsets in the evening were even more breathtaking. The beach front is unparalled by any other hotel along the strip. It is clean, safe ( police regularly patrolling) and groomed each morning for a new day. Ladies, dress is from casual to very upscale. REstaurants are the same so be prepared. SHopping on site is very expensive for clothing, just as are all Hilton sites tend to be.THe ABC store on site , however offered reasonably priced food to go, liquor, souveniers, etc. WE used the coupon books to our advantage and you receive those upon check in. EAting on site is expensive but you can modify. Yogurt, bananas, sandwiches in our mini fridge worked for lite meals and snacks. We often shared a breakfast at the restaurant kiddy corner to the resort in the mornings and we were happy campers. Servings are large and prices are less than half you would pay on site. On site the Brfst buffet starts at 17 US, coffee is 4 US, alcoholic drinks are always 10 US or more. Many late afternoons we shared tacos for two at the Tropic BAr for 10 US and we loved it as we listened to the entertainment. Take along a thermos cup and fill it from your room if you wish or during the day take a cooler bag and ice to where you wish to enjoy the sun, beach and or pool . It is a tip I picked up on trip advisor and used a lot during our stay. Room service ....... well we were tired after a 17 hour treck through the sky from Canada, so we did it because we knew what jet lag was going to do to us in the next few hours.Two sandwiches with water only were 54 US. Be prepared for that. Dinner for two at the restaurants will be 150 t0 200 US, without alcohol. You can eat off site very well and inexpensively if you look. for it in the main district along Kalia street and Kelawana street.. Happy hours work with half price appetisers too! Don't let the high cost of meals deter you from this hotel. It is well worth it to stay there and eat off site. Our visit to Oahu was fantastic because we stayed there and explored the island at our pace using what the hotel could offer us for enjoyment, relaxation, car rentals and tours. You won't be disappointed, so enjoy your vacation. We will definately return and would recommend this hotel to any age group.

<Content>Good pre-cruise hotel We stayed in the Ali'i tower for two nights before our cruise and really enjoyed it. Particularly the free use of the exercise facility as well as the separate pool with very comfortable beach chairs. Was much more relaxing than the main pool area and still had access to the beach. Room was clean and quiet, with a quasi-ocean view if we leaned over pretty far on our deck. Good space in the bathroom with the sink and closet separated from the shower and the toilet. Had no problems with housekeeping or other staff, and easily got a late checkout so we could head right to our cruise ship when it was available for embarkation. I enjoyed the overall layout of the resort, many of the hotel entrances were integrated with bars and shops so you couldn't tell you were surrounded by 5,000 rooms. Agree with some of the posters that the food choices at the resort leave something to be desired and are a little pricey, even for Honolulu. Had dinner at Bali By the Sea one night and ate at the pool restaurant for lunch, but otherwise ventured off property for the rest of our meals. Really enjoyed Duke's down by the Outrigger for dinner, and had both breakfasts at the Eggs  Things a couple blocks away from the hotel. Location was convenient to the main shopping areas, and within walking distance of Diamondhead if you were motivated - we took the bus there and walked along the shops back. Overall was a good prep for the cruise, and would recommend it to other travelers.

<Content>Great View, Clean Rooms, Great Staff Very good hotel! Great room view, clean and quiet room, and great staff. I stayed for almost 2 weeks and was very impressed. Room was a little older but was stylish and very clean. On site food and drink is a little pricey but other resturants and the rest of Waikiki are only a short walk away. The grounds are exotic and beatifully maintained. I will certainly stay again.I have been traveling to Honolulu for business for almost a decade and have stayed at several of the hotels. Hilton Hawaiian Village is my favorite palce to stay.

<Content>very good experience We just recently came back from a 13 nights stay at the HHV. A very good experience overall. We had problems however at check in. We had checked in in advance earlier in the day via internet on the Hilton site being hilton honnors members. We had been assigned a room with King size bed in the Rainbow tower oceanview and 32nd floor which sounded fantastic. Upon our arrival on the property around 9 pm she wanted to give us a room with two beds.. this was our first wedding anniversary and 13 nights in two beds.. could not do. It was very frustrating since we had reserved months in advance a king size bed and had been assigned a much better room on the web site earlier in the same day. She managed to find us a king size bed in another tower but we really did not appreciate the treatment and it took her a long time to find something else. She never really explained who had gotten my room or if it was available or not.The rest of our stay was very pleasant. The hotel is big and very busy but it is the best section of the beach in Waikiki by far and it does not feel too crowded on the beach. The fact that it almost never rains in Waikiki beach (20 inch per year) compared to other beaches and the rest of Oahu ( up to 200 inches per year..) is to take into account and can make up for it being more busy then elsewhere. The umbrellas and chairs rented by the company on the beach is a major rip off (60 US each day..) but at least you don't worry about having to rush there early morning to reserve one to be sure to get some shade in the day since if you are willing to pay there are always some available.The hotel has really made an effort to integrate Hawaiian culture in the decorations which are quite impressive everywhere on the resort. You also get cultural activities like Lei making, Hula dance classe and Ukulele lessons opportunities almost every day on site which is very nice. The resort is very impressive with well laid out lush vegetation and nice animals of varous kinds which makes it quite unique in its kind. /They had a show every night around 6 pm of hula dancing which was quite fun and on Fridays it is longer with fireworks. Some live music at different places on the resort starting at 4 pm every night is also very good. They light up the property at night by torch and they do a ceremony of this lighting every night at the beginning of the show.We really appreciated to have in the resort many boutiques of all price ranges from the ABC store to get cheap snacks and things to L Vutton accessories. It was pleasant to stroll the boutiques at night and it was not more expensive here then elsewhere in town. The proximity of Ala Moana shopping center at a few blocks was also nice. The Borders music and book shop of Ala Moana shopping center has an amazing selection of Hawaiian music if of interest to you. The restaurant were also varied and very good. We tried most of them. Some things are overpriced like the tropical drinks which cost almost $10 each but the location of the bars being directly on the beach kind of made us feel it was ok for them to ask that much. It was possible to eat for a reasonable price at other meals without being too expensive.You do feel a little pressure to go visit their timeshare being built next door and they take every opportunity to invite you, I think they should avoid doing that too much..Rooms were very nice but our room was an adjoining one and we were woken up some nights by our neighbors coming in late. The rooms were kept clean and the view on Diamond head and the rest of Waikiki really makes it worth your money to get a ocean view room. Luggage handling and every other services were very good.We did many private tours with a local company Hina adventures who do eco tours and historical tours. We booked hiking and a tour of the monarchy and archeology and we do recommend their service very much it was just great. We also really enjoyed our day at the Polynesian cultural center where we got super ambassador tickets and this really gets you the vip treatment with reserved seats everywhere including in the shade when everybody else in under the blazing sun and also a private guide even only if you are a group of two which is really nice. The submarine Atlantis is ok but not the highlight of our trip since there are not that many reefs in Hawaii, the ones being there are artificial and there are not that many fishes. But we did see some giant turtles so it was worth going but not the best.

<Content>Good Trip In the heart of downtown Honolulu. Property is tropical  lovely. Enjoyed seeing the parrots  other birds plus penguin exhibit was neat. Rooms were very good but wouldn't consider them exceptional.Shopping on the property was high end - Louis Vuitton, Chanel, etc. Car rental kiosk on property is convenient. Several open air restaurants  bars; good choices for eating both casual  upscale. Loved the Asian restaurant.Tour options are good -- favorite was visiting the USS Arizona Memorial. Very moving.Beach was just so-so. Small pebbles made lying on a towel uncomfortable. We rented a car and visited several other Oahu beaches that we found much nicer.Spa was good...but layout was a bit strange. After you check-in and change into robes, you must get on an elevator to get to the treatment rooms. I didn't enjoy the co-ed elevator ride - not relaxing.If you have children, this would be a good spot for them. The hotel had programs to keep them entertained and they all seemed to be enjoying themselves. We were NOT traveling with children...so sometimes it got noisy, wet elevators  noise in the hallways but not too unpleasant.Travel time/time difference from the East Coast is the biggest handicap for me returning. For the money  time - I'm heading back to the Bahamas. But if I'm ever back in Honolulu, I would likely stay here again.

<Content>Loved the view My husband and I booked the Hilton Hawaiin Village standard room for 8 nights through my corporate travel agent for $239/night more than a month ago. I was on business and my husband was tagging along. When we arrived at check in around 3 pm, we were told the hotel was oversold and they were taking volunteers to be relocated at the Embassy Suites. For the inconvience, they offered to pay for 1/2 of the stay, or 4 nights. Well, the Embassy Suites is where I often stay for business and because I was on expenses, I was not interested, least of all in Hawaii. We were told it was still voluntary at this point. Well, the desk clerk started typing away at his computer, and then suddenly disappeared for about 10 minutes in the back room! We knew they were going to send us to the Embassy Suites anyway. My husband reached into his bag and slapped his TRIPADIVSOR.COM baseball cap on his head. Soon, another desk clerk came by to let us know that the desk clerk was still working on a room for us. She asked if my husband worked for Trip Advisor. He was a little vague, and said that we traveled often and blogged about sites. Next thing you know, they magically appeared with a corner room in the Rainbow Tower, 5th Floor. We had a view of the sunset on one balcony and Diamond Head on another. The view was great, although they start dragging the beach in front of hotel around 4 am. I like to sleep with windows open, but not an option with the early morning noise. The firework show on Friday night was right below our window and was spectacular. The other thing I didn't appreciate was that when we checked out, the desk clerk inquired as to how many days we used our in room safe and then were charged for the use. I don't recall seeing that this was an additional charge. Still, I paid for one day internet usage, and was able to continue to use for the entire week at no extra charge. By the way, the TripAdvisor.com baseball cap is now affectionately called the MAGIC HAT by my husband. He swears we get better service when he wears it. Thank you Trip Advisor

<Content>Great hotel, room and beach We stayed in the Ali'i tower 3rd floor with partial ocean view. Positives:The room over looks a beautiful public park and partial view of the ocean. The room itself was very clean, the beds had nice crisp sheets with mattresses that were vey close to my own. The room really was great, no complaints at all. The maids cleaned just enough not to disrupt your personal belongings. There is a outdoor pool, hot tub, exercise room and a lounging area on the second floor of the tower. Free appatizers every night between 5-7pm(finger food). There is a couple of large pools outside at ground level with a huge lounging area as well. The beach directly out front is kinda busy, but if you walk a couple hundred feet it turns to a public beach which is not as busy. The sand is nice and not too much coral or other obstacles to walk over. Take a stroll down the public beach and hit a food stand under the first condo/hotel called Wakiki Pizzaria? ( I think) Great food and good value. Subway is also there and a few other good ones. The hotel and grounds are on it's own at one end of Wakikii beach so it is definetly much quieter than all the rest that are side by side. You can walk or take a city bus practically anywhere on the island. If you walk to the International Market don't buy the first thing you see because, almost every vendor sells the exact same thing and some do barter very very low. My wife and I felt very safe every where we went.Negatives:There is lots of shopping and resteraunts around the hotel grounds, but most are a little expensive for my tastes.Overall 9/10

<Content>Enjoyed our honeymoon at the Hilton Hawaiian Village! My husband and I stayed at the HHV for the second stop on our two week honeymoon in June 2007. He is a Diamond Hilton Honors member so we were able to cash in some points for a week free and it was well worth it! The grounds are AMAZING with the wildlife (I loved the African penguins) and it was nice to have a small little city within the hotel grounds. We enjoyed browsing the shops and buying souviners and admiring all the beautiful ponds and landscaping. The beach was pretty good - except you need to rent a chair which is a little much in my opinion. The location of the HHV is great - within walking distance of some great restaurants (there's an excellent Thai restaurant right on the corner near the main entrance to the HHV). All of our meals, although pricey (what isn't in Hawaii?) were really good - no complaints about the food and we had some wonderful dinners in the resort restaurants. I loved the breakfast each morning - very, very good!My one big complaint was how compact the main pool was - the chairs are on top of one another and you have to get down there early to get a good seat with total sun. We ended up spending more time at the smaller pool near the hot dog place as it was quieter and more relaxing.If I were to return to Oahu, I would absolutely stay at the HHV again. It was clean, with beautiful grounds, nice staff, and local to many other attractions. In general, however, I'd probably try and stay on the North Shore as it is less of a city than Waikiki and more of what I consider relaxing. It all depends on what you're looking for and we were happy having things to do and see at the HHV.

<Content>Fantastic Resort! Loved it! My husband and I stayed here Feb 9 - 16, 2008 and we had an amazing trip! The stay started off with a bit of a wrinkle... we booked through a travel agent, paid for a full ocean view room. Our agent requested a king size bed for us, but when we checked in, we were booked to a room with 2 double beds. When I mentioned that my agent had requested a king size bed, after quite a bit of searching on the desk clerk's part, a room was located for us, and we were upgraded to the Rainbow tower.. however... when we got to our room... we were on the wrong side of the hotel for our full ocean view! I immediately called the front desk to complain and will give this advice.. when you have a complaint, remember to be polite! I read on this website before leaving that if you were rude to them, they did NOTHING for you, so I nicely explained that though I appreciated the upgrade to the Rainbow tower, I didn't get the view that I had paid for. At first they tried to sell me on the Rainbow tower to prevent having to move me, but I didn't relent, so I was put on a waiting list for the next morning since there were no more roms with king beds available. The next day were received a room on the 23rd floor of the Tapa tower facing the ocean and Diamond Head... we LOVED it!! They even let us view the room first and decide which one we liked better before packing and moving our stuff... wow! Very Accomodating!!We felt that the Tapa tower was a better tower than the rainbow because it was a bit back from the beach and less noisy, it had express elevators for the higher floors (the rainbow did not) and it had it's own pool and bar which were NEVER as busy as the Superpool and bar were. No matter what time of day, we were able to get a seat at the Tapa pool, though the pool stays fairly shaded until after 1:00 pm. I recommend the Tapa over Rainbow anyday!!Other things you should know:CAR RENTAL - There is a Hertz on site... don't use it! It's twice the price of any other rental company and they don't offer free parking even though the lot is on their property! We rented from the airport which was by far the cheapest deal (dollar rent a car, book ahead of time on the internet, it's cheaper!), and self parking was $22 per day, though you have to valet on your arrival, prior to check in. Just tell the front desk you only want valet for one day.LATE CHECKOUTS - This service, the hotel doesn't offer, but they do have a service called Hospitality rooms. The day before you leave, call the front desk and make a reservation for a hospitality room.. it's basically a regular hotel room stocked with towels and soap and you get 20 mins per person to use the room to shower and change before you head to the airport. Also, you are still allowed to use all of the hotels services until 7:00 pm the day you checkout.FOOD AND DRINK - These things can seem pricey, but it ain't Mexico! If you've been to Vegas, the prices are about the same... and we found the onsite restaurants to be no more, or less expensive than the restaurants downtown. In addition, there was a huge variety of restaurants onsite to choose from , and downtown is only a 15 minute walk with even more selection!IN ROOM INTERNET - The TV feature is terrible!! It's $8.95 for an hour and extremely slow! The options say you can check your home e-mail... you can't! The good thing is, the front desk gave us a credit when we complained, and even the assistant manager of the hotel didn't recommend the service.SPA - We went in and asked for a price list... they didn't have one...??? In addition, they tried to sign us up for the Time Share presentation in there!! ?? If you want a massage, I recommend booking at the Superpool massage station, no sales pitch, prices are the same, and the massage was great! One final footnote - be prepared for the Time Share sales pitch, we just ignored them and didn't sign up. You get $100 in Hilton bucks to spend in the resort, but we couldn't be bothered.Other than the few minor glitches, which can be expected on any trip, we absolutley LOVED this resort and highly recommend it. The staff were extrememly accomodating and friendly, and the roons were clean and beautiful.. ocean view or not! Have fun!

<Content>Fabulous Time at The Hawaiian Hilton Village My wife and I just returned home from the most wonderful 2 weeks that one could ask for. The staff and the Resort itself were second to none and it simply couldn't have been any better. We were upgraded to the Ali'i Tower with out even asking for an upgrade, certainly cannot complain about the check-in staff. We found all of the staff that we encountered to be wonderful and certainly they knew how to spread the Aloha. We were more than pleased by this beautiful resort and we would certainly recommend it to anyone. There are so many great restaurants in Waikiki Beach that you don't have to worry about the cost of dinning out. There are so many positive things about the Village that I found it hard to imagine that anyone would not enjoy staying there. We have travelled extensively and stayed in many 5 Star resorts and this was certainly one of the best. Don't let the negative reviews scare you away from the Hawaii Hilton Village, you must experience it for yourself as we did and you will find the best beach area and a first class hotel will make for a fantastic holiday. ALOHA

<Content>Large and Busy I stayed here for a week on while traveling on business. Overall I was happy with the hotel especially from a business traveler standpoint. The rooms were clean, comfortable and quiet. When I did have time to relax having the option of two pools and/or the beach was great. The pools were very crowded and there was little space between each lounge chair. These areas were packed with people making it tough to find a chair. In the hotels defense my stay was during Pro Bowl week.If you are looking for a quiet vacation site or property, I would recommend looking elsewhere, as this whole area is pretty busy and loud.

<Content>Great stay! Beautiful hotel! Beautiful location! My husband and I stayed for 3 nights in the Rainbow Tower. Our room had an ocean view. The room was beautifully decorated. The weather was gorgeous and sunny. It is a full-service property. I was tired and was there to relax. I loved the fact that I didn't need to leave the property for anything. The property is lushly landscaped. You feel like you are in a tropical garden. There are palm trees, waterfalls, tropical fish, turtles, penguins, birds, etc. There are several pools. The main pool is the Super Pool. We had a balcony and basically slept with the doors open, because we loved it so much. We had the breakfast buffet each morning downstairs in the Rainbow Tower. My husband is a Hilton Honors club member; hence we received a great discount on the price of the breakfast buffet. We also had lunch and dinner at the property (Hanajuban Noodle Shop, CJ's New York Style Delicatessen, Lappert's Ice Cream, Tropics Bar and Beach Caf茅). Some of the restaurants have Early Dinner Specials (i.e. Benahana). We spent each day on the beach or exploring the property. We did venture down the beach to the Outrigger Reef Hotel to have dinner at the Shorebird one night. We remembered it from a previous visit to Waikiki and enjoyed it. On my next stay, I plan to spend several hours (if not an entire day) at the Ala Moana Shopping Center.

<Content>For the business traveler overpriced, noisy, and crowded I am a Hilton Diamond HHonors member and recently stayed in the Ali'i Tower on a business trip to Honolulu as I have for over ten years. Sadly, I plan to not return to the Hilton Hawaiian Village, but shift to the Hilton Prince Kuhio.For the rates one is charged to stay in the Ali'i Tower - presumably the best lodging offered, one would expect a higher level of guest service and certainly a better stay experience. Unfortunately, both were lacking from the time I checked in right through my stay.Making my reservation using the Hilton Family website was effortless as is always the case.The only way I can desribe checkin is the word bedlam. The valet parking ($28 a night) personnel were overwhelmed and cars were backed up for a 20 minute wait. After leaving my car, I went directly to the Ali'i Tower, which touts its separate check in facilities. Unfortunately, the check-in counter was innundated with groups of guests. Checking in involved a wait of almost 30 minutes and I was disappointed to find no automated check-in kiosk.The greatest disappointment of my stay was my room. I had requested a quiet room. As an aside, at the Ali'i Tower, you can reserve - and of course pay for - one of three room types (full coean view, partial ocean view, or garden view). Frankly, the only way you'll see the Pacific Ocean if you're in a partial ocean view room is if you're an acrobat and hang over the balcony. If you want a view of the ocean, plan on paying $100 or more per night. Otherwise, save your money and content yourself with a view of the pool or a view of the wedding chapel. When I arrived at my room on the 6th floor, I found that I had been assigned a connecting room, a room with a single key-locked door separating two guest rooms. The result is like having no door at all between rooms. The desk staff claimed that no other rooms were available in the building and that, in essence, I was stuck with what I had been assigned. A family with two or three very, very young children were in the connecting room and the noise throughout the night kept me from getting much sleep. My adivce to you is that if you're assigned a connecting room you refuse to accept the room and seek a replacement room.The simple truth is that a stay at this property is a process to (a) separate as much money from you as possible and (b) incessantly market the Hilton Grand Vacation Club to you. DIning prices (let alone room service prices) are obscene, even by resort standards. I agree with others who have recommended that you buy food and beverages at the nearby ABC stores and/or dine off-property. Frankly, if you are staying here with your family, my advice to you is this: if you have a rental car and a Costco membership card, stop at the Costco that's just off the Nimitz on the way in from the airport (right across the parking lot from the Dole Cannery). Stock up on pretty much anything you'll need (the Costco even sells hard liquoir!!!) before going on to the hotel. All the rooms have small fridges with a tiny freezer.The HIlton Village is crowded with conventioneers, grumpy families, and an almost endless stream of wedding parties. If you want a quiet island vacation, the Hawaiian Village is not for you.

<Content>Don't stay here if you want to get away from it all! We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for a conference that was being held at the local convention center. What a zoo this place is! It's absolutely huge with just about anything anyone would want, but if you really want to get away from it all--DO NOT STAY HERE!! From the pools at the base of the hotel towers with people partying into the night, to the price of everything, aka: $15 to rent one lounge chair, $30 to rent an umbrella for the day. That's $60 for the two of us and we have not even bought a drink yet! Hey, I don't wanna buy your stuff - just use it for the day! Oh, and want a cup of coffee? The urns of coffee in hotel lobbies that usually is complimentary--try $4 - YIKES! Hey, can't you get a Starbucks for the same price? The best days of our trip to Oahu were spent in a $59 dollar-per-day red convertible - hawaiian music playing on the radio driving around the island-the North Shore, the shrimp trucks on the east side, Banzai Beach. and the beauty of the Pali look-out. The locals with ice cold coconut milk stands and freshly cut pineapple. THOSE will be my favorite memories--NOT the overpriced, 3000 room Hilton.

<Content>Beautiful, but just not for me I have stayed at The Village numerous times for long visits. Even as a repeat guest and Diamond Hilton Honors member (if you don't know what this means, join Hilton Honors and find out -it's great!), I find that my treatment at this hotel varies. My first trip, last year, was wonderful. I received an upgraded room with a lovely partial ocean view. Subsequent trips ping-ponged between good and ok. My last trip was horrible. I was treated extremely rudely on check in, given a sub-par room (the lady claimed there were no better ones, but others in my party were given much better rooms even though they are not frequent guests), harassed when my husband stayed with me for two nights (which is supposed to be free for hilton honors members), and treated horribly both times I tried to eat on the premises. One waitress at the Tapa Bar ignored us for twenty minutes while she chatted with the bar-tender - and then told us that the bar was closed! As I walked away from the bar, I heard the bar-tender offer another patron a drink. As a general rule, the food at the Village is over-priced, not that great, and totally unavailable after about 9PM - but it's a walk to the main part of Waikiki. They were even rude when I tried to leave my luggage at the Bell desk while I went to get my car at check out. I was not feeling the aloha.As a business traveler, I also find The Village a bit crowded. The pool area is busy and exposed, there is no hot tub, and it's not relaxing. To be fair, the Village is lovely - the pools, flora, fauna, and view are all beautiful. There is live music every night and it is right on a gorgeous stretch of beach and a lagoon - but I can't help but feel that I'm in a mall every time I stay there. It is so crowded - and a little like Disneyland. The amenities are just not what I'm used to when I travel for business. They simply do not cater to executive travelers. Everything feels like it is costing them extra effort - from charging a meal to my room at one of the over-priced and sub-par restaurants to the little details that make my constant life on the road bearable, like picking up my dry-cleaning, or rectifying an incorrect room charge. I find this very strange, since the only reason they are not empty like many other Waikiki hotels is the fact that they host so many conventions and business travelers.I guess the bottom line is - it is beautiful, but it's not for me.

<Content>One of my favorites!! I have stayed at this property many times over the years. I enjoy the grounds and the amenities. I just stayed in the renovated Tapa Tower. Nicely remodeled. The TVs were older though. Nice view and balcony. I have stayed in every tower at this property. Of course Alii is the best but Tapa and Kalia are nice. I like Tapa because it is closer to pools and main hotel area. Having all those shops and restaurants so close is convenient. But, if you like being in the heart of the Waikiki action this is not the property for you. It is a long walk to the Waikiki beach and shops. It is a shorter walk to Ala Moana Center. I like being isolated as I feel there is less crowded feel to the beach.

<Content>Our Hawaiian Paradise We recently stayed 5 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian village. It was by far our best experience of all of the hotels that we have stayed in. (Sheraton Waikiki, Waikiki Marriott, The Hyatt, Ala Moana Hotel, Marriott Koolina, The Prince) We were in the lagoon tower. When we first arrived, we unloaded our luggage and I asked for self parking. I hate to wait for the valet to retrieve my car. I was told parking would be difficult and some have even gotten lost, perhaps this was their effort to get me to valet park. I told the attendant that I was pretty smart and I think I can find the garage. I found a parking spot which wound up being just outside of the entrance to our tower. Our room was amazing. It overlooked the lagoon as well as the ocean. We were able to watch the evening entertainment they had for special events on the lawn. We were close to the beach as well as the walking path along the beach. The restaurants and shopping inside the village were real convenient. Our room had an oversize lanai with large sliding glass doors. When left open, it just added more space to our living area. We left thinking that this is the place where we want to come back to.

<Content>Great location We stayed at the HHV for only two nights before a cruise and really enjoyed it. We found the service to be excellent, always a smile on everyone's face and a real willingness to help. We were upgraded to an ocean view room and the room itself was very clean and the bed was comfy. (We stayed in the Kahlia tower that I think was the most recent to be renovated so that could be why it was so nice). We did a spa treatment for my boyfriend's birthday, the spa was gorgeous and very relaxing. Only one problem, they gave us our robes to change into and when I was done changing I came out and the woman told me to go back into the changing area and wait until she called me-a lovely area with magazines, coffee, etc. so I didn't mind waiting. After about a half hour she came and got me and brought me down to the massage room area where my bf told me that our masseuse had been waiting for us the entire time and everyone had been looking for me.....???The pools were REALLY cold, one of the days there was only one person in the super pool. The prices are outrageous for drinks so try to stay away from the hotel bars. The location is probably the best part of the hotel, the beach is right outside and downtown Waikiki is within walking distance. A short cab ride away is Diamond Head, the zoo, and the aquarium (the zoo and aquarium are right across from each other and we actually walked back to the hotel from them through downtown Waikiki).The hotel is really expensive and there is nothing included with the price. The only restaurant that we ate at (besides the little beach bar) was the Village Steakhouse which was excellent, the service and food were well worth it. There is a 24 hour diner right across the street from HHV which is cheap and good, we went for breakfast and the night that we got in at midnightish. All in all, kids will have a blast with the beach and the pools. The grounds are beautiful and there are penguins, fish, and birds. It is a really beautiful place but not many perks for your money. But I would definately return!

<Content>Excellent. We stayed here on Honeymoon in March 2007.A very impressive complex, right on wakiki beach.A typical American resort hotel, clean , excellent food with great service. Lots of different restaurants to choose from, also several bars serving almost any sort of drink you could want!The room (in Diamond Head Tower) was large and modern with a view along the beach from the balcony. A minor problem with the plumbing was fixed within 20 minutes.No doubt this is an expensive hotel, but we were spoiling ourselves and felt it was well worth it.

<Content>3 star experience and 5 star prices From check in, and throughout my stay, it was clear that the staff and service levels were significantly substandard for a 5 star resort.Upon arrival I was confronted with 2 long queues for check in, with no signage and no staff direction. Having finally determined which queue to join by other patrons, I then had to wait 45 minutes before being served by a clearly grumpy attendant (although I can sympathise as she was very overworked). Given that a conference was on and it was known that there would be a high volume of check ins that day, I'm surprised that more staff were not put on to deal with the workload.Despite requesting an early check in, I was required to wait until 3:30pm to get access to my room, at which time, despite having checked my suitcase with the bell boy 4 hours earlier, it sat sitting on the sidewalk next to the concierge desk.When finally given my smoke free room, I was disappointed to find that the room reeked of smoke - right through the bedding, and all soft furnishings. Even as I was attempting to get another room booked, the bell hop was only concerned with getting a tip, not helping to resolve the issue. This that's not my job mentality was rife throughout the entire staff.The facilities in the room were woefully lacking, with no mini-bar, no robe, and very basic toiletries provided (no body wash, no moisturizer, no cotton buds or cotton balls).The location was quite good, although a little too far from the main Waikiki strip if you wanted to eat out of your room (you'd need to walk over 1km to get to the resto area).There are many other luxury resorts in the Waikiki area, many with lower room rates, that I would recommend over the Hilton.

<Content>Go With An Open Mind. My partner and I just returned from an eight night HHonors award as a HHonors Diamond member. A lot has been said about this property - both for and against. Here's my two cents: it's clearly not for everyone. Like any hotel anywhere, a traveler needs to perform due diligence and research all options. It's a very large hotel that has to cater to a wide selection of guests. Are there better options such as time-shares, house rentals, other locations like the North Shore? That's for you to decide. Are there less expensive options? Once again - only you can decide. But for a full-service, beach-front Waikiki hotel, you're going to behard pressed to find this amount sheer activities, shopping, and dining in one place. Overall, we were impressed with the cleanliness of the resort, and the attitude of the staff. The FB options were no more expensive than any other Waikiki beach front resort. And that is very important aspect to remember: sure, you can eat at the Waialana Coffee House around the corner for $10 - but you can't at any other Waikiki beach front resort.We e-mailed the GM one week prior asking for best available upgrade. Response received approx. 48 hours later from Front Desk manager assuring top level treatment (Rainbow Tower, corner king). Also guaranteed usual Diamond/Gold Breakfast Coupons, and gave us access to Ali'i Tower Oceanview Terrace Pool, and evening pupus. There is a small gym located there as well. So right off the start - on an award - we were offered everything we wanted.Arrived approximately 830PM from Mainland. Reception area pleasantly uncrowded. First room offered was 8th floor Rainbow Tower Corner King. We were not impressed. Yes, it was beachfront, and it had two balconies - and it was exactly what we had been promised. But it was just a standard room. And not very high up. Second offer was for 14th floor Rainbow Tower Executive King facing the lagoon - but we couldn't occupy it until the next day. Not happy about that. Third time was a charm for us. 20th Floor Tapa Tower 1 bedroom Suite - directly facing the Super Pool and the Beach. The room was newly renovated: entrance hall, living room, wet bar, dining room, 1/2 bath, large king bedroom, dressing area with sink, and full bath - with window sidelight in the tub. Two balconies: one facing the Super Pool/Beach, the other facing the City. For our purposes, we were very happy. We also asked for and received free internet access for our entire stay. Maid service was excellent - especially with a small tip.Breakfast every morning at Tapa Cafe since Rainbow was closed. It was always busy, but never more than a 5 minute wait. We had the option of using the Diamond/Gold card at Tropics or at Ali'i, but Tapa was by far the best. Upgrade at Tapa is currently $10. Ate one meal at Golden Dragon and enjoyed it. It is closing permanently sometime around the first of February. Ate twice at Hatsuhana, and twice at Tropics. All good, and service was great.The Executive Lounge in the Kalia Tower is permanently closed. I guess the reason we got the access to the Ali'i was because we complained about that.The evening pupus at the Oceanview Terrace at Ali'i were very nice: two hot appetizers, and a large cheese/vegetable/fruit display. Nice place to watch the sun set. Mixed tropical drinks run about $9.We did the HGVC spiel because we wanted the $150 HHV Vouchers which came in handy for meals. I would rate the pressure level as medium. If you can spare the 1.5 hours and don't mind it - I would recommend it. If you don't want the $150 HHV Vouchers you can get 30,000 HHonors points.Lagoon is open, clean, and waterfall is running. Of all the pools, we thought Ali'i was by far the best. If you can get the access, do it. All the pools were cold. One attendant at Ali'i told us that they had stopped heating the pools.For approximately $8, you can get a day pass at Mandara Spa in the Kalia Tower which allows you use their japanese style hot-tub, steam room, sauna - but no spa services.Asked for a very late check out (5PM) on our day of departure - no problem. Used one of the Hospitality Rooms in the Diamond Head Tower for 45 minutes prior to departure for no charge. Shuttle back to airport then back to Mainland.We got a lot of extra perks for being HHonors Diamond members, but putting that point aside, we still thought it was an enjoyable vacation and would recommend it again. Feel free to contact me if you have further questions.

<Content>Nightmare We booked this hotel through Costco Travel. We have a 2 year old so we made sure that we had a crib reserved and put on our confirmation. When we arrived, the hotel told us they dont have cribs any more because of the liability. They tried to give us a pack n play to use that had blood on it. They also said there would be no noise because they are not doing renovation like the rest of Waikiki. They however didnt tell us the hotel next door to them is, and the noise is horrible. The hotel is very tired looking. We ended up moving to the Kahala and was very pleased even though that is being renovated also.

<Content>Not bad for a Convention Site Just returned from a weeks stay. Purpose of the trip was to exhibit at a convention on the property. The hotel convention halls were very clean and the staff helped out. Needed extra hangers for my display, called bell desk and bell man brought the hangers right to my booth within 10 minutes. Stayed in a garden view room in the Tapa Tower. Had very good view of the pool. Room was cleaned on a daily basis. In the evening I could hear the nightly entertainment from the balcony outside my room, but when I closed the balcony door I could not hear noise. The food in the convention hall was very good. It was provided by the hotel. Fresh fruit and fresh sandwich wraps. From other reviews on the site I did go to the all you can eat pancakes at the coffee shop across the street. At $5.75 for two eggs, two pieces of bacon and endless pancakes this might be the best deal on the island. Did not have much time for the beach, but I did take a stroll on it and it was very clean. Would go back with my family.

<Content>What You Expect, Minus A Little Aloha My family wrapped up 11 nights on Maui and Oahu with a two-night stay using Hilton HHonors points.Check-in was relatively brisk, though the bellhop taking our bags out of the car was a bit brusque.The room and view were fine, as was the free breakfast we were entitled to. Though this is an immense hotel, it's eminently possible to find places where you're not amidst teeming crowds. Overall, we found the pools, food and amenities to be what we expected or more.The only exception was with the valet parking, which cost $26 a day. It used to be a dollar less, but for your convenience added a dollar to include a tip.However, the first time I retrieved my car and didn't slip the attendant a dollar, I was given a dirty look. To avoid that, I gave the next guy a George Washington the following day. Upon returning home, I wrote to the hotel's general manager, who explained that the extra dollar was negotiated into the valets' contract because many people weren't tipping. All well and good, except when they try to guilt you into effectively double-tipping.The GM agreed that was not acceptable, and I'd be curious to see if it's been policed more aggressively. Overall, though, this was a nice stay if you positively, absolutely have to be on Waikiki.If you don't, I'd recommend renting a house or condo a little out of the city in a place like Kaneohe, just 20 minutes or so from downtown.We did that the first four nights and got a beautiful house at the top of a hill for just $160 a night, and got to experience Hawaii amid the locals rather than tourists for some nice slices of life. You can save a lot of money and get a more-authentic island experience at the same time. Pretty good deal in my book. Vrbo.com has an ample selection of listings.

<Content>Highly Recommended!!! This is a gorgeous property. There are multiple towers, we were in the Kalia Tower on the executive floor which was very nice (we were upgraded for free!). The rooms were exceptional with Crabtree and Evelyn bath products, spacious balconies, and attention paid to detail. Included with executive status is continental breakfast from 8-10 am each morning with a nice selection of fruit, pastries, cereals and an afternoon tea starting at 4pm with snacks (quiche, cookies, veggies, etc). The pools are nice and there is a lagoon as well. The property is on the beach and in the midst of high-end shops. A short 10-15 min walk gets you to Waikiki Beach. There are many restaurant options in the hotel vicinity, though, so you can consider this a complete resort with pool, shopping, spa, and restaurants all on the premises. Aquacylces, kayaks can be rented on the property as well. We had a great vacation here and would recommend it to anyone......

<Content>Subpar standards due to buyout this past year!!!! BEWARE!!!! For those who have visited Hiltons in the past, please beware! I am currently a diamond VIP for hilton and i must say i was very dissappointed with the standards at this hotel. However, i will point out the wins and opps separately to be fair.Wins:Huge village, lots of shopping, nice weekend evening shows with fireworks, very nice beach which is not too packed, great view of Diamond head from the beach as well. Pool and scenery is great and there are nice animals within the village including penguins, turtles, birds, and fish....Staff were also very friendly overall within the restaurants and shops and the front desk as well..Opps:1. Room Standards - extremely subpar. Our first room was at the diamond tower and the room had a horrible smell coming from the bathroom...the sink was somewhat clogged which caused alot of odor to permeate through the room. The closet door was broken, only 3 pillows were given for a king size bed, NO lotion as an amenity? (i get lotion even at a motel 6....) and as a diamond member, they forgot to provide me with two bottles of water...the worst was that they had a welcome letter since i was a diamond member stating that there would be two bottles in the room...address these concerns to front desk manager Jin, and he gave us an upgrade to the Rainbow tower which gave us a wonderful view but still, the amenities and room itself were average at best. 2. Food - Breakfast was standard, however, as a diamond member, you only get free continental breakfast....other food was subpar as well...we tried some japanese noodles which was awful, we had a buffet one night which did not match to what the pictures looked like....prices were extremely high3. HHONORS priveleges - no more exec lounge due to buyout, no access to gym unless you pay, no complimentary ANYTHING...besides a continental breakfast....Overall, b/c the hotel was so big and busy, i did not feel the personal attention i usually get at a smaller resort...for a honeymoon, they did not do one special thing for us. If i did not complain, i would have settled for an awful room. I suggest anyone who stays here to go out to eat. Several nice places and some hole in the wall places if you go out to eat. Better quality and prices. Yes, everyone says hawaii is expensive, but like NYC, you can always find a good deal if you look hard enough...if you choose to stay as just a tourist, then tourist prices is what you'll pay...Island itself has alot of shopping, hiking tours are great...try out Oahu Nature Tours....staff is really friendly. North shore was sometime to see, and get some sun on the beach!Feel free to let me know if you have any other questions...

<Content>Beautiful Hotel My Husband  I took our 3 year old son there and had a great time. The hotel  it's grounds are lovely, and very well maintained! The rooms are small, pretty and very clean and the beds  bedding were very comfortable! The location cant be beat! The beach is so beautiful, and not so crowded in front of the Hilton as in many other places. The pool is nice, but it is very hard to get a lounge chair because people always leave their towels on them. They hand out towels by the pool but, there are no towel bins to put them in when you are done, so many of the towels that are reserving the chairs are actually from people that aren't even swimming any more. Even without chairs, we really enjoyed this resort! We would come back!

<Content>Million Dollar View The Hilton Hawaiian Village (HHV) is a huge resort right on Waikiki Beach that does not feel like one. The open air lobby sets the tone -- informal, lush plantings, talking parrot, lots of water splashing in fountains, a view through to the large pool and the Pacific beyond. We arrived late from the mainland and our room was not ready, so they comped us a couple drinks and after 15 minutes led us to room 1203 in the Rainbow Tower. What a suprise -- a fabulous view over Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head that was worth the wait. For folks who normally end up looking at the air conditioners or dumpster, it was a revelation. The room itself was fine -- nice linens, excellent bed, AC worked. The Rainbow Tower is a landmark that is 40 years old, so some of the other towers are much newer, but the location is ideal -- right on the beach, close to the shopping village, lobby and parking structure. HHV is close enough to the rest of Waikiki that a 10-15 minute walk puts you high on the hog in shopping heaven. Our only quibbles were the $15+ per day they charged for internet access and the $20/day they charged for self-parking. We would definitely stay at the HHV again.

<Content>Loved the Hilton Just returned from a seven day trip (Jan. 12-19). What a perfect hotel. We stayed in Rainbow tower, Room 2500 (25 represents the 25th floor). I strongly encourage everyone to stay in the Rainbow Tower. I think it has the best views of all the towers. Rooms ending in 00 or 01 are the corner units facing the ocean. Any odd numbers are great rooms as well, as they face down Waiikiki towards Diamond head. The even rooms face towards downtown, but you still have a partial ocean view. The hotel made this trip. Waikiki is very, very busy beach and Hilton has the best location at the end of the beach. It gives you a very expansive portion of beach (we had plenty of room), unlike other hotels that have literally no, or less than 10 yards of beach. Plus, you can easily walk down to Dukes (overrated in my opinion) or the Royal Hawaaainn (you HAVE to go here for Mai Tai's...simply the best on the island). Also recomend HY's Steak house and Michel's at the colony surf for two of the best dinners i have had. Hy's was one of the best steak places I have been, and it had the best ceasar salad. Table side cooking is great for some items. Michel's is the perfect place to have a 6pm reservation, as you get the sunset. The hotel looks out on the ocean (other end of Waikkiki). Also recomend the hike up Diamond Head, the visit to Pearl Harbor, and a nice drive around the island and visit to the North Shore. We hit diamond head early a.m (7) and it was fine. You have to get to Pearl Harbor early (we got there around 645) to beat the busses which show up b/t 645 and 7. We were back to hotel by 945 and had the whole day. Should get a car so you can drive as you want - we put over 500 miles on it adn still were on the beach everyday. Its great to drive to dinner, and you are not at the mercy of the bus, especially diamond head, pearl harbor, etc... Worth a day trip around the island - spend some time on North Shore (Cholo's mexican was great for lunch) and spend some time at beaches on east/southeastern side of island. Any questions, please feel free to shoot me an email.

<Content>Hooray for Hilton We stayed here from 23rd December to 29th December 2007, and WOW!!! what a winter wonderland, the perfect Christmas location!!! The hotel stands on the widest stretch of Waikiki beach in the perfect setting.The resort is huge with many places to eat, and many enticing shops. The large pool has a wonderful bar serving many delicious cocktails with or without alcohol. It can be expensive to eat here every day, but a 10 minute walk brings you to the main stretch along the beach, with many cheaper bars and restaurants.We stayed in the Tapa Tower, with brilliant views of Diamond Head [volcano], and city, and a partial ocean view. The room was huge, as we were upgraded. We have a 13 year old daughter who thoroughly enjoyed turtle watching whilst on a pedalo in the amazing clear waters of Waikiki. This hotel really does have it all, and never feels overcrowded as it is so vast. Also the people are helpfull and friendly this really added to our enjoyment of our stay here. Checkin is very fast especially if you are a Hilton Honours card member as they have their own checkin desk.This was a truly fabulous hotel, and we will hopefully return as soon as possible.

<Content>Ho Hum at the Hilton My husband and I stayed at Ali'i Tower for 5 nights this January. I was immediately disappointed when we first walked into our room, as they are slightly outdated (even with the flatscreen TV). I laughed at the miniture TV mounted to the bathroom counter... I think it was from 1988. The rooms are good sized with large bathrooms and seperate dressing towers. I can't believe they actually charge $3.50 a day for the in-room safe (even in the Ali'i Tower). The maid service was on the ball, however, and we had great twice-daily service.However, the place did grow on me over the days we were there. The 5-7pm hot and cold appetizers were a nice touch (complimentry). The drinks are strong (should be for $9.75)... try their Mai Tais or Tropical Itch. We did enjoy the nightly live music and sunsets from our room (room #1026 overlooking the superpool and if you walk out on the deck and look left, the ocean). The Ali'i tower pool is small, but not very crowded and has the best lounge chairs if you're a layer. They're teak with large cushions (vs the vinyl chairs around the super pool which are crammed in).We heeded the warning and did not eat much at the Hilton property. Yes, the food and drinks are very expensive (think $14.95 for a burger). We bought quite a bit of snacks at the ABC store on site. We had a great dinner at Kobe Japenese Steak House which borders the Hilton property (think Benihana but its independent and been there 27 years... or was it 37?). We also had a great dinner at Nobu which is a 15 minute walk.Considering everything else on Waikiki, this is a resort with multiple pools, a great beach, and easy access to the stores/restaurants/front desk/etc from your room. However, the resort is large and very mixed and just not on par with the other Hilton's we have stayed at (our favorite is the Hilton Los Cabos so far).

<Content>Alii Tower is better but still not up to snuff The hotel is nice overall. The resort is huge. It is both a blessing and a curse for it to be so large. There are many options, but it lulls you into not leaving. The Alii Tower rooms were nice and pretty good size. The dressing area and separate bathroom areas were very nice. I was disappointed that despite this upgraded section of the hotel that there was no lei greeting, and no doorman. We had our 9 month old with us so we had a stroller and the doors were always closed, so it was just a pain to open it every time to go in. For an upgraded section of the hotel, I was a bit disappointed with the lack of such details. The Alii Tower pool deck is fine with nice chairs. The breakfast was very disappointing, even though it was included with our room. There are no hot dishes for your $15.25. I think this is good option for the price, but it is unexceptional. I would recommend skipping the very expensive dining options at the hotel. They seem ok, but not worth the price. Nobu is about a 10 minute walk down the boardwalk across from the Halekulani. Roy's is also next to Nobu. You'll spend less than at the Golden Dragon or Bali by the Sea, and the quality is so much better. There is a Thai restaurant at the corner of Ala Moana and Kalia that is quite good with live dancing. It's a bit expensive, but still better than Benihana at the hotel.

<Content>Not worth the price! I've stayed at the Hawaiian Village before and the grounds are what brought me back, but i was sorely disappointed after my last visit. I stayed from December 27th-Jan 2nd then went to stay in Maui for 5 more days. When we first got to the Hilton we tried checking in at 1:40 pm, i had been up since 4 am pacific time and desperately wanted to change. I was told the check in time was 2 pm and a room wasnt ready also i was told to leave my number and i would be called as soon as it was ready. At 3:25 i got tired of waiting for a phone call and stood in 2 seperate lines and finally was given my room key. The room was a disappointment. i was being charged $525/night for a room with one pen in the whole room (i looked), and not so much as a complimentary water. Above that the restroom was questionable. The toilet seat was peeling and when i tried to take a shower the drain backed up and i was ankle deep in water. I stayed at the Diamond Head Tower and on New Years night couldnt find my room key so i tried to find a desk to get another, i was sent from tower to tower because the computers were down, it was a real waste of time. All in all for that much I expected better service and anemities. The grounds are still gorgeous but i'd really reconsider staying somewhere else and just visiting

<Content>Awesome We stayed here for 14 nights on honeymoon and I wasn't disappointed with my choice of hotel.This Hilton is huge, like it says, it鈥檚 a village with about 4 hotel towers surrounding the inner circle of restaurants, swimming pools, shops etc... But it鈥檚 not packed in and you鈥檙e not overlooking anyone. Check-in was fast and friendly. The room was lovely with stunning views from our balcony of the resort and beach! The room was of a good size and the bathroom spacious and clean!Each tower has its own spa facilities and pools, but you can go to the others, but it鈥檚 a 5 min trek to get there and not really worth it you would be better off going to the beach which is fantastic.This hotel is friendly and welcoming, with excellent service, the only disappointment really was the cost of the food in the resort - it was good food don't get me wrong, but its cheaper to eat at one of the restaurants outside of the complex.If you can go on a sunset dinner cruise, you won鈥檛 be sorry鈥?/p>

<Content>It was OK Our family traveled to Honolulu for 2 weeks during Christmas and reserved 3 rooms for 17 nights at the HHV. To be brief, it was ok......but that is about it. We would not stay there again, but it was nice.We found the rooms to be clean, and well maintained. We were promised one upgrade since we were renting 3 rooms for so long (and because we are Hilton Gold Members) , but there were none available. This was disappointing. The manager and the reception staff are adequate, but not overly friendly or helpful.The pools are VERY crowded, and it is nearly impossible to find a lounge chair by the pool. The thing that we could not believe is that the pool and ocean front bars all close before 9pm. The only places open to get a during have really bad live music 7 nights a week.If you are planning a trip in the very near future, please be aware that most of the restaurants are closed for renovations. They knocked power out to our building and we had to walk up to the 31st floor for a full day.....and the managers did not apologize. We had Christmas dinner at Bali By The Sea restaurant, $150 per person. The service was fair, and the food was not very good. The Chinese restaurant was great, but they are closing very soon....which is sad. I had read so many reviews that were complaining about the prices of everything....and it was really not as bad as I expected. The drink prices were all about $10, but most all of the other places on the beach are much cheaper. They are about $5 at Dukes. The ABC store is very nice, and reasonably priced.The lagoon opened when we were there, and it is a nice addition. It offers swimming and other water sports, and there is a nice sandy beach.Things not to miss.....A Lava Flow Drink (from Duke's)The King's Jubilee Show at the hotel....very nice and only $10Snorkeling the Coral Reef right outside of the HotelA Helicopter tour of the island (THIS WAS GREAT!)And if you are interested in the Pearl Harbor tours, check out Home of the Brave tour. It gets to Pearl Harbor earlier in the morning. If you get there after 9am, there is a 3-5 hour wait.....but get there by 7am and walk right in.

<Content>Absolutely fantastic! My new husband and I had the opportunity to stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for our honeymoon from January 5th through the 12th of this year. I must say, after reading some of the reviews on this resort, I was extremely anxious to arrive to either confirm or deny the comments of other travelers. I am happy to report that our stay at the resort was met with pure optimism and an amazing experience.We arrived at the Hilton late in the evening on a Saturday after a long flight from New Jersey. My parents are Hilton Grand Vacation Club members, and were gracious enough to give us their timeshare for our honeymoon as a wedding present. Therefore, we stayed in the Lagoon Tower. When we got off the shuttle, our bags were taken immediately to our hotel room without hesitation nor pressure to be tipped. We were guided to our tower and immediately checked in without any problems. I had heard on this site that the resort was currently under construction in certain areas, which is true. However, we were lucky to be placed in a room on the 14th floor facing the lagoon and the ocean. We had a fantastic view from our room, where we were able to see almost the entire resort as well as the water. The room was very clean, as well as the balcony. My only complaint concerning the room was the bathroom, where I was expecting a separate tub and shower after staying in other 1 bedroom condos through Hilton in the past. However, this is not a necessity.The places to eat in the resort can be very expensive. However, with the location of the Hilton being in the midst of Waikiki, dining options are endless outside of the resort. I would recommend dining at Bali at the Sea in the Hilton, due to the quality of both the service as well as the food. It isn't cheap, but if you go at 6pm Monday through Thursday, ask for the Sunset Dinner Special, where you receive a special menu with dining entrees at a reduced price. As for the resort itself, it has absolute character and appeal. I found it to be absolutely beautiful, whether you were at the beach or on the sidewalk on Kalia Rd. The service was fantastic. We were always greeted whether we were arriving or leaving our tower in the resort. Questions were always addressed on the spot and handled accordingly. I would definitely recommend this resort for couples despite past reviews saying it is more family oriented. Vacations are what you make out of them. Yes, there were families with small children at the resort during our stay, but in no way did it hinder our awesome experience.If you're looking for an active honeymoon full of activity as well as relaxation, the Hilton Hawaiian Village will provide just that.

<Content>Expensive, but Superior Resort The Hilton Hawaiian Village on Wakiki Beach is a sure-fire way to have a superb Hawaiian experience. There is a reason why this is the top-grossing property in the Hilton Family of Hotels. A meticulous, well-run, family resort right on Wakiki Beach, this property boasts exotic birds and wildlife, numerous shops and restaurants, an immaculate beach, a number of swimming pools, adult and children's activities, fireworks on Fridays, tour services, and a hospitable staff that will make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. Be prepared, the hotel and food are not cheap, so plan accordingly. Beachside hamburgers at Tropics Cafe for a family of four will give you a tab of over $60.00. That said, you can book this hotel in confidence that you will have a truly memorable stay at a superior resort.

<Content>Needs Updating We chose the Hilton Hawaii Village resort for our honeymoon as it look gorgeous in all the brochures. On arrival the Hilton Village ticked all the right boxes, beautiful lobby, wonderful swimming pool, gorgeous gardens, great shops etc etc. However, when we made our way to our room, which was situated on the right hand side of the Rainbow tower, my expectations were clearly too high as I found the communal areas and corridors to be a little bit dated. Our room was pleasant and clean, but it definately felt as though it had seen better days, and the bathroom needed a lick of paint! Overall however, it was a lovely stay, the 30 second stroll to Waikiki beach certainly made up for the disappointing decor and the swimming facilities were fantastic! Eating out wasn't a problem either as you are central to so many things (we decided against eating in one of the many restaurants at the village, as they were quite expensive)!! The experience certainly hasn't put us off Hawaii, but we would think twice about staying at the Hilton.

<Content>Not a hotel for Hilton Diamond Members I booked my stay at this hotel in April 2007 for the period December 25th to December 31. I checked at least 3 times (two in December) to ensure that I was on the list for an upgrade. I have been a Hilton Diamond Member for over 4 years and have a continuance until April 2009.Arrived on December 25th to a sold out hotel. They did have a king size room reserved in the Tapia Tower overlooking the garden pool and over the band area of the cocktail lounge. The band played from 7:30 p.m. until 11:00 p.m. I asked to be notified of any potential upgrades over the 6 day stay and was told by the manager Kim that all rooms were pre-assigned.They did provide a complimentary continental breakfast coupon. I was advised that all executive floors are closed and there will no longer be an executive lounge. In other words this resort is not seeking or rewarding business members.Imagine my surprise re upgrades when on December 31st I was referred to the refreshment room in the Tapia Towers to find this room was a suite overlooking the ocean. Why use a suite for a quick change room prior to travel?Food and beverage was expensive. Room service was good. This hotel is for tourist groups and families. I do not recommend it for business or single person travel.

<Content>Nice If You Choose the Right Tower This is our second trip to this hotel. First trip during summer of 2006 seemed much better - property was better taken care of, food was better, less construction going on. We were hinted by the check in staff that management changed since then and that the property now should be rated as 3 stars. They even closed some restourants and are closing others. In order to get better experience, you should stay at Rainbow Tower. We booked our trip through American Express, and, while booking, we asked to make sure we will get a room in a good tower. AmEx assured us that was the case. We then called the hotel and they said that AmEx uses Travelosity to book packages and that you get no choice of room/tower (warning)! We were placed in a Diamond Head tower - at best the room is 3 star. Moreover, right outside there was loud banging due to construction on the tower next door. Yes, this was an ocean veiw room, but you would have to put up with the loudness from construction to open your balcony and get out to look at the ocean. After spending one night at this tower, I went to the front desk and asked for a change of room. I was offered a room in Talia tower (not sure of the spelling). The room was nice, but, again, construction right outside. I asked then to be moved specifically to Rainbow tower. That cost me extra $80 per night. No comparison - the room is nicer, the view is amazing, and the best part is - you take the elevator down and you are on the beach. The good:- Rainbow tower views - amazing- Beach is close, no waives, weather is beautiful, sand is nice- City is fun and only a $5 cab ride away- In room movies are fresh from the theaters for $14 bucks a show- Beds and bedding is nice- Sergio's restourant - very nice italian food, not too expensive.The bad:- The hotel is extremely expensive - they will charge you for everything and a lot. For example - coffee bags or tea bags - first is free then it's not free, and nobody notifies you about that until you see it charged. Umbrellas/snorkling equipment rentals - crazy expensive. Drinks/food - very expensive too. In comparison, Maui Four Seasons where we stayed summer of 2007 does not charge for umbrellas and water at all.- Check in took 40 min of standing in line - I saw this happening every day as we walked by- Water in December was a bit cold- They do not allow floaties in the pools for children - how strange is that? Pool is also cold.- Room decor/furniture/bathroom fixtures are all outdated, bathroom is tiny.- Housekeeping does not clean well - you can notice some amount of dust on the phones, lamps, so on. I found a nail clipping from a previous traveler on the floor when we checked in. - Beach rentals staff in the little cabin on the beach that pass out towels and set up umbrellas are rude and spoiled.- Bali by the Sea restourant - over rated and not good.- Room serivce - very expensive.- Rainbow Lanai all you can eat breakfast - OK, but if you go to CJ's Deli inside the property away from the beach - way better and one plate can feed two people.- Spa is OK, but the massage was too light and they push you to buy products. Check in at the spa took 30 minutes. Overall, our first stay in 2006 was much better than in 2007, but they are updating rooms so it might get better. Still this was a nice vacation and we had lots of fun - who stays in the room when there is a beach outside anyways?

<Content>HHonors Diamond Disappointment I have been a Hilton Honors Diamond Tier member for over 6 years. When traveling for business, my overall experiences have been worthy of such loyalty. However, I redeemed points for my stay at Hilton Hawaiian Village and received such substandard treatment that Hilton is no longer my first choice for business travel. This trip was a special occasion. My reservations were completed via the Diamond Member direct line. Reservations were confirmed and I relaxed knowing that the details were taken care of. A month prior to my arrival, a member of the property management contacted me via voice mail and email with a request to adjust my stay to another property on the island, as the hotel was oversold. Five return calls and two emails on my part over the following two weeks with no response left me concerned and unclear on my reservation status until my arrival. Upon arrival, I checked in, and was provided an average room, in a back tower, overlooking an active construction site. A call to request a room change was flatly declined due to the hotel at capacity. Zero effort was made to make the circumstances better. Actually, I felt marginalized when hotel management made it clear to me that since I was redeeming points and not a 鈥減aying鈥?customer, I was placed in the least desirable tower in order to accommodate 鈥減aying鈥?customers. Mind you, I have been a loyal, 鈥減aying鈥?customer at various Hilton properties over the past 10 years with enough stays to achieve Diamond Tier membership. Other less than positive highlights: Being reprimanded for attempting to remove half a glass of milk from the HHonors Lounge. Other guests in the room turned and looked at me, the milk thief, standing in the doorway with my cup of milk, a determined staff member (who I'm confident is simply following instructions) is set on protecting the $.30 cents of milk I'm about to walk away with. Assessing the situation, I asked myself at what point did my hotel no longer recognize me as a valuable, loyal customer... and no less, an adult? I imagined the HHonors guests, the most loyal and cared for guests, pillaging the lounge of all its contents on a daily basis to warrant such security. A smile, calmly setting the glass down, and walk across the street to the corner coffee shop resolved the situation. On another instance, a security officer reprimanded us for crossing outside of a crosswalk. Add to this inaccurate billing issues, charging for wireless internet access, the non-return calls from property management, and the sum is an exceptionally sour part of the trip.It is worth adding, that prior to checkout a call was placed to the Diamond support line, lodging a complaint. The person at the Diamond Help desk informed me that the property management would be notified, and committed to have the property management contact me within 24 hours. No return call was received.

<Content>Great Location We spent 10 nights at the HHV, the location is the best in Waikiki, close to high end shopping and restaurants plus all tour companies pick up at this hotel. The good points of this hotel are 1) the beach infront of the hotel is huge in comparison to other hotels along the strip 2) a large selection of restaurants on the hotel grounds itself 3) alot of shopping on the grounds itself 4) the surfing lessons at the hotels beach were wonderful, great instructors and reasonable $ 5) free childrens activities including snorkeling lessons, hula dancing which all were well taught 6) our room was large and updated w/ nice bath, I think it depends on what tower you are in. The adequate/ok points are 1) the gym/fitness center 2) the Friday night Hawaiian show for $12/seat 3)breakfast in the restaurants 4) check-in/out 5) overall cleanliness of the hotel grounds and roomsThe bad points are 1) if your looking for a romantic getaway, this is not the place, this is a family w/ kids hotel 2) pools are way to small for the complex w/ pool chairs pushed smack together and you have to wait in line at 8:30am for a pool chair unless you want in the back under a palmtree w/ no sun also pool towels are limited, all parties must be present to get a towel and they ran out each day around 12noon 3) buffet was ok-not good vs. price- quality of food 4) alot of traffic, people and cars from outside visitors not staying at the hotel 5) attention Hilton Diamond VIP's, there is no executive lounge w/ free bev/food as in other Hilton resorts, you get a free continential breakfast and free access to the fitness center, no other bonus like free water in your room daily,etc... 6) the towels in the room/bathroom, you get 2 sets, that is it, we asked the maid, wrote notes for an extra set included tip but no extra towels.Overall, a middle of the road 4 star hotel, if you have little kids you will like this place if you are a couple you won't.

<Content>Stay away from the village My family and I stayed at this hotel from Jan 3rd through the 6th and have no intentions of ever staying there again. The elevators broke and we were forced to use the service elevator to get to our room. The rooms were over priced at 300 + per night and extremly small. The service was very poor . The pools close at 4:30 pm and guests are charged $13.00 a day to use the gym facilities. No one walks around the pools to take drink orders and it is very difficult to find healthy alternatives to the 12 dollar hot dog. The beach was beautiful with a diamond head view but be sure to bring your water shoes because it is quite rocky and and many guests had been stung by sea urchants. The one positive was that they did upgrade our room to an ocean view because it was not ready when we arrived.

<Content>Would definetly come back again! Was extremely impressed with the speed of check out/check in. We had been traveling for a long time and were extremely tired when we had to check in. The woman who checked us in was extremely friendly and made it very easy. We stayed in the Ali'i tower and had a great view of the ocean. Housekeeping was great, came multiple times a day. Whenever we needed anything we just called and had the item within a few minutes. Loved the private pool for the tower and the hors d'ourves were good as well. They make it so you really never have to leave the village with all the shopping and restaraunts on the grounds. It was great to walk around the grounds and see the different animals and just the landscaping was beautiful. The King's Jubilee and fireworks was a good show, it looked to be crowded around the Super Pool area and in order to get a seat poolside for the show you had to pay $12. So we just watched the show from our room. The fireworks were amazing!

<Content>A mini-waikiki in itself We stayed here during the peak Xmas holidays and was definitely worth it.We never stepped out of the hotel for shopping/dining. Didnt waste time commuting to other places in search of food or cultural activities.Totally relaxed at HHV as it houses many cosy to exotic restaurants and has reasonable to sophisticated shops.Bus and trolley stops are at a stone's throw. Plus point was ABC convenience stores to buy water and souveneirs.Enjoyed the collection of books and novels in their library and all guests have the privilege to borrow books/novels for free for 5 days.Kids are provided with board games there.Kids enjoy the penguin and turtle feeding.Also crafts village near rainbow tower holds so many activities like hula dance, garland making etc . Guests can get a feel of Hawaiin culture.Pools were clean but the snack bar by poolside(TAPA tower) offers very limited snacks and drinks.Rooms are clean with comfortable linens. bathroom was tidy and towels seemed very new.Room service was expensive though.Overall, an overwhelming experience at HHV. Though on the expensive side,will recommend this hotel for a family vacation in Honolulu.

<Content>Very disappointed with service this time We've stayed at the HHV before and had a great time, but found the service to be far lacking this year. Several months ago, we booked two adjoining rooms for the week in the Rainbow Tower, but when we checked in, they gave us separate rooms (doesn't really work to have three kids under 10 down the hall from mom and dad). For the first 30 minutes of discussion they said too bad, can't do anything for you, you're lucky you're on the same floor, then they decided to comp us on a roll away bed, so all five of us could get in one room for the night. Then another hour of discussion later and facing written confirmations that we booked (and paid more for) connecting rooms (as well as our plan to perhaps start asking our neighbors in adjacent rooms if they would mind swapping so we could be together), they magically (although unhappily) found connecting rooms for the remainder of the week. The issue wasn't so much the lack of the rooms we had booked and paid for (which was annoying, but we understand that mistakes happen), but more the really bad attitude with which each of our questions was met....there was definitely no Aloha spirit in the hotel. A simple we're really sorry for the error, how can we make it up to you? goes a lot further than a defensive and rude oh well, it's not my problem attitude. This used to be our favorite hotel and a place we looked forward to visiting. Unfortunately, we will be looking for a new place to stay in Waikiki.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed 12-22 to the 29th. Very nice hotel with excellent staff. Mary Jane at the front desk upgraded us to the rainbow Towers and it was a fantastic room. Yes its a Hilton and the prices are high. Draft beer is $7.00 and internet is $14.99 but its a beach Hiltlon! Tons of stores on the property with shopping close. Lots of great places within a short walk to eat and shop at for a lot less. Senior Frogs...Spagetti Factory..ect. The time share presentation is about 1.5 hours and they will give you $100 in hilton Dollars to use at stores and resturants. The place is packed so if you want seclusion dont go here. About a $30 taxi ride to the hotel from the airport.

<Content>Great Location But Pricey I stayed at this hotel for a convention. Great location, right on the beach. It was pretty expensive, I was glad someone else was picking up the tab. At the time of my stay, there was a considerable amount of construction going on in and around the hotel. One of the two lanai's had cables dangling in front of it for a painting platform, similar to window washer. Overall, it is a very nice place, just be prepared to spend some $$. Keep in mind, it is Hawaii and everything is expensive!

<Content>Fantastic property!!!! I travel with Hilton quite a bit for work. While I often get upgraded, nothing could compare to the room, the service, the staff, the location, and the ease of staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We were upgraded to a suite on the 26th floor of the Rainbow Tower. It was bigger than my first apt. It had 2 balconies (overlooking the harbor) and 2 full baths. We enjoyed the room so much that we didn't want to leave. Also, it is extremely convenient to shopping, restaurants, etc. The staff was so warm and friendly. We could have spent a whole week there instead of just the 2 nights we were there. The free buffet breakfast was outstanding, the beach was quiet (considering it is on Waikiki). The grounds are very well maintained - don't miss the penguins! so cute! There is even a beautiful little chapel if you are getting married or renewing your vows. There is live entertainment in the evenings and it was just so-so.

<Content>Would not stay here again We loved Oahu, but we would not stay at the Hilton again. We chose it b/c it was the only resort listed with a kid's pool, but when we got there, we realized there were only 4 lounge chairs at the pool, and the rest were tables belonging to the Hau Tree Bar and you had to buy something to sit there (the wait staff bugs you until you do). Also, they charge for ridiculous things like .50 cents a minute to check your email and then you have to hike to the front office to pay before you begin. The towels are a huge pain (you have to walk down to the beach to get them and then stand in a raft rental line.) If you get them from the Tapa pool, you'll be charged $20 if you don't return them there (hope someone's on duty when you do!), which they fail to mention when you pick them up. For some reason, this is the only pool that does this. The beach isn't very nice there (looked like any old beach in the US) and it's a 20 minute walk to all the shopping and restaurants. There were too many annoying things to list here, but believe me, if you are booking this resort for the amentities, DON'T! We never even found the gym, but were told it was on top of the spa and you had to make an appointment to even get in. Ahhh!!! Try the Mona Surfrider or the Sheraton. They both looked beautiful and are in the heart of Waikiki.

<Content>A Great Resort! I have worked for a major airline for over 20 years, and have had the opportunity to travel to many places and stay in many hotels. This truly was one of the best! We went to Hawaii for the Hawaii Bowl, and didn't make a hotel reservation because of the stiff penalties for cancelling last minute. (traveling standby you never know if you are going to get on the plane or not!) So, we walked into the Hilton and were accomodated in the Ali'i Tower (nice sized rooms with concierge service and amenities) at an airline discount Christmas week!! Room was oceanfront, very large, very clean, flat screen, twice daily maid service, turn down service, private lanai etc. Beautiful wide beach, biggest on Waikiki. Tons of shopping and restaurants on property plus within walking distance of many stores and eateries off property. Spa (pricey). Childrens village (for a fee) Several pools/bars. Everyone was very polite and gave great customer service. We were granted a late check-out AND were given a courtesy room free of charge in the evening to shower and change after a long hot day at the Hawaii Bowl before going to the airport for our 11 pm flight. So great!! This is an option for everyone. Just request the service a day or so in advance so you can get the time that works for you. I would definitely stay at the Hilton again!

<Content>OK - but, I guess it's a good place to stay , I don't have anything to compare it to as it was my first stay in Hawaii.If you like visiting another US state, but with ridiculously high prices and clogged roadways, I guess Hawaii (Oahu) is the place to go.As far as the Hilton goes, stupid rules for getting towels (my 6 year old son had to be with my wife in order to obtain a towel), and $35 umbrella rentals and no chairs or lounge chairs on the beach unless you forked out cash, set me off the 1st day. After that I was just annoyed with the lousy elevator service, and theoverpriced cost for food. (Note: the food of choice for Hawaiians is SPAM, they serve it everywhere ). Sushi can be found inexpensively off 'Hilton Campus', (Aloha Sushi up the road is very reasonable), but like other reviewers I feel that $9 for a Heineken on the beach (at Tropics bar) is a bit much. (Actually there were signs on the beach that you couldn't take alchohol beyond a certain point - OOPS - didn't see that sign and packed my 6 x $1 a bottle Heiny in a ABC shopping bag with ice.) Maybe it's where we stayed, but the cost for food was ridiculous.(eg.$11 for a pastrami sandwich - $35 for a pizza delivered to your room) - I'm not cheap and we actually paid some of the prices being asked - but I felt that we were Royally being taken advantage of. A good place to eat was The Cheesecake Factory - large portions (sharehe Appetizer Ceasar), and quick friendly service. All the pools at the Hilton were VERY cold (on Christmas Day - maybe their busiest day of our stay - I saw at most 10 people in the 'Super (cold) Pool' ) Usually my son leaves a pool because he's exhausted - this time he would leave because he was shivering and his lips were blue from the extremely cold temps. (The pools 'open' at 8:30 am and 'close' at 5:00pm - What's with that ? - I've never run into such restrictive'rules' in the past. They will actually blow a whistle, make an announcement and let you know when you have to get out of the ice-bucket.) The only warm pool (Tapa Tower) childrens pool was closed due to ??? -puke/baby [--]in the pool - who knows - no explanation was provided. This was probably a blessing as the Spanish inquisition for the 'towel sign-up' process was avoided.  I highly doubt that this review will be published, so I'll stop now - but next year I'll be booking Cancun....

<Content>Impressed with the Hawaiian Hilton Village In Oahu I was a bit hesitant to stay at a Hilton, but was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The HHV has the most beach of any hotel on Waikiki. I was shocked to see how little beach space the other hotels had.This Hilton is on 22 beautiful acres - waterfalls, penguins, flamingos. it is a great location, in between Ala Moana Mall and downtown Waikiki. The rooms were nice and comfortable.My only complaints - the food is horrible and overpriced and the service is mediocre at best.Overall, this hotel is great and worth the very reasonable price.

<Content>Nice on the outside but... Honolulu is definitely not the Hawaiian paradise that you see in those nice travel brochures, TV shows and movies. It seems as if the city hasn't really kept up with the times, at least the Waikiki Beach area. Things seem to have gotten stuck at about 1985 here (although there is a lot of new condo apartment construction going up).The Hilton Hawaiian Village is a perfect example.The good:Several large swimming pools - great for families with kidsCheck-in was quick and upgrading to a room with a better view was easy.The bad:Upon arrival, nobody to greet the taxi and assist with bagsRoom contained the green room service menu which was the old one - was informed by room service operator to look for the orange menu which was the new one (and had only half the items as the old one).Room service food awful. Chicken noodle soup came straight out of the can. Asian teriyaki chicken salad contained 3 slices of chicken with the skin still on the chicken - expected to find chicken feathers in the salad too!No water pressure for the shower, and I mean NO water pressure at all.No hot water - not even any WARM water.Room came with a baby crib for some strange reason.Wallpaper is peeling off.Furniture is 20 years old (though the bed is the usual very comfy Hilton bed).Bathroom as big as a broom closet.Elevators old and noisy.So, with that said, we are cutting short our 4 night stay after just 1 night and heading to one of the other islands.I would suggest to anyone planning a visit to Hawaii to consider Maui or, if you have the money, Lanai. Skip Honolulu.

<Content>Incredible experience My wife and I chose the Hilton Hawaiian Village for a three-night pre-cruise stay in late September 2007, and we were so glad we did. You really cannot go wrong with this fantastic place. The whole resort is extremely pleasant, and this was definitely one of our best stays ever.The rooms were very comfortable, decorated in good taste -and with great balconies (oceanview, in our case)-, and the staff was always kind, helpful and efficient. The pools were large and beautiful, and the general atmosphere was really lovely.Sure the Halekulani is the most luxurious one, but at the Hilton, with a room so nicely appointed, with grounds so beautiful and immaculate, and with restaurants so inviting (the breakfast buffet was excellent and the rest of the food was more or less average, but the atmosphere was always incredible, especially at night), one really gets the feeling of having got it completely right at a quite reasonable room rate.

<Content>Great view, Bali by the sea is great, avoid the other restaurants We stayed Dec. 8-14. My wife was on business so I had all day to explore. First the good: The hotel room was much better than I expected. We got upgraded to 30th floor of the Rainbow Tower and had a great view of Waikiki beach, the city and Diamond Head crater. It was unbelievable! In addition, the room seemed recently renovated, and the bath had granite counters and nicer tile. The maids were very efficient and seemed to know when we were gone, and always had our room done before we returned. It has a nice pool (no Jacuzzi) but the chairs are somewhat haphazardly arranged, and you can't see the ocean from the pool. There is a little village on the premises with a good sushi place, an ABC store for booze (like a 7-11) and some high end shops. There is also a high end restaurant, Bali by the Sea at the Rainbow tower which was excellent but expensive.Now the bad: Avoid the Tropics Bar altogether, as the food was terrible and overpriced ($12.50 cheeseburger on stale bun with plastic utensils + $9 beer in plastic cup). The breakfast is just as bad (lousy continental breakfast), to make matters worse it is about the only place to use your breakfast coupons. The only redeeming factor is the view. You are better off walking 5 minutes down the beach to the Shore Bird where the prices are lower and the food and the service is better. Walk another 5 minutes and have a gourmet lunch at the Royal Hawaiian. We had one breakfast at the Rainbow Lanai, which was only fair and a $10 upgrade from the breakfast coupon (for eggs, bacon, etc), not a good value. Also, they charge an extra $12/day to use the exercise room, just jog on the beach.Altogether I liked the hotel, Bali by the Sea and the sushi place, I would avoid the Tropic bar and Rainbow Lanai.

<Content>Used to be a Diamond Members dream - not any more I've been staying here for business and pleasure for the last 5 years and it was great - that all changed after Hilton was purchased by the Blackstone group - the Diamond member floors and lounge have been discontinued, parking is now $25.00 plus $1.00 tip per day, the diamond member breakfast is a stale role and juice at the beach juice bar. They now charge $3.50 per day for your room safe, the room service prices have gone up 3x (Supreme Pizza (14) $35.00, Spinach Salad $19.50, Coffee $8.50, American Breakfast $28.50 - all have a 17% surcharge and a $4.00 PER PERSON additional room service fee aka $40.21 for that 14 inch pizza.All mini-bars have been pulled from the rooms, and they have had large staff layoffs so the cleaning is suffering and the staff is not in a good mood. During my visit they did not changing the bed sheets unless you called housekeeping and insisted - at check in I pulled a towel out of the rack to find fresh human feces on it, not washed and did not come out but fresh feces.Talked to the Night Manager who would do nothing and really gave me the impression that if you鈥檙e not from Japan they don't have any interest in your business and being a Diamond member get's you little.They have even cut out little things like moisturizers in the bathrooms.If you've got money to burn and have to be at a beach resort this is your place - I'm taking my business back to the Price Hotel. Really sad to see such a fine property go south when the bean counters start twisting the screws.Do yourself a favor and book at the Hawaii Price Hotel in Waikiki for the same or better per night rates.

<Content>Had a Great Time We stayed at the Hilton on our Hooneymoon from Dec 4-14. The hotel staff are so great. I felt so welcomed from the time we checked to the time we left. They could not do enough for us. The hotel is huge like some people have said however we like big hotels. There is so muh things and so many places to choose from to eat. Some off the resteraunts are pricey. There is a 24hr coffee shop right arcoss the street which is cheaper and the food it great! It was called the Wailekea.A bit of advise when staying there on a budget. Try to eat off property. There are some other resteraunts off site as well that are good on a budget. We went to Red lobtser,  Subway there are a couple of Star Bucks as well. American Express Tours help desk at the hotel was great and helped us a lot. If you go ask for Julie she is great, well they all are but that is the only persons name I can remember. Try to go the International Marketplace to get soveners before you buy at the hotel because you can bargain for some of your prices and get more for your money. It is about ten minutes away from the hotel. Bali by the sea was wonderful but it is pricey however, if you are there to have a romantic time then this is the place. Food  service EXCELLENT! Along with Rainbow Lanai.I will deffinately stay here again. We stayed in an ocean view Rainbow Lanai Rm it was wonderful overlooking the beautiful Lagoon, From our balcony we could see the ocean and the mountains. Loved this hotel and can not wait to go back!

<Content>Nice, if bland hotel Was here for a conference in September. Definitely recommend the check-in at the airport which was a big time saver. I waited in line to use the ATM-like machine for check-in while my husband waited for our luggage. When we got to the hotel (about $30 taxi ride) we skipped a very, very long check-in line.We had a partial ocean view/balcony room in Tapa tower which was a nice size. The crib we requested was not in the room, but after a phone call it was brought very quickly.Pools - the pool at all the towers (except the super pool) are small. More of an issue is that there is no shade at the pool. This was an issue as we were travelling with an infant.The hotel restaurants are pricy. We went to both buffets for breakfast (Rainbow Lanai and Tapa Cafe). The Tapa cafe has a nice selection of Japanese foods and Rainbow has an omelette station but otherwise they are pretty boring buffets and not worth the $30+. We also went to CJ's NY style deli, which was fair. It was our first night and we were jet lagged and starving so it suited our needs - but we didn't go back. Round table pizza was fair and slow for lunch. The Kahuna dog at the tapa pool was out of shaved ice for a while one day which was disappointing. Tropics bar  cafe had the best service overall at the lunch we had there.THere are many fancy, overpriced shops in the hotel. Overall, the hotel has nothing special to offer although it is clean. Location-wise it's good if you want to only go to the mall, but it's a little far from the main strip in Waikiki which is where I'd rather stay.

<Content>LOVED this Hotel! LOVED this Hotel! We ended up moving here from the North Shore due to power outages after storm. The front desk staff was more than helpful during our check-in - it took them a while to check us in, and because of that we were upgraded to a great room, given free breakfasts and free dinner! The room was EXCELLENT! Great twin pull out sofa for our daughter, lots of room, great balcony and view, HUGE bathroom! We will definitely go back to stay here - you can never go wrong with a HILTON hotel! Lots of things for kids to do and see. If you are looking for a great family vacation, stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village!

<Content>The best yet in Waikiki I recently stayed at the Ali'i Tower at the Hawaiian Village Resort.I was upgraded to a higher floor with a partial view, I thought is was because I was Hilton Hotel Club member. WRONG !!I may have been given a little upgrade because of this, but this was special and made my holiday the most memorable of many, many visits to Waikiki.I use a walking stick, 3 broken legs, I do not flash it around, but put it on the desk at check in.Check in staff must have noticed and gave me the upgraded room with Handicap amenities - I only realised this the past few days, when I went to purchase a hand rail for my shower at home, there was one over my bath in the hotel, also my room was very, very large, as was the bathroom.My upgrade to this room was discretely handled and I never ask, I don't want to draw attention to myself.Mahalo to the kindly front desk staff, you made one guest supremely happy.Joshnoah

<Author>Happiest_Wanderers
<Content>Surprise by how much fun we had; best beach on Waikiki Okay. So we've travelled all over, but never to Hawaii. Hawaii just never made our top ten. But by a stroke of luck, I was offered the chance to go on a business trip to Hawaii. So off I went expecting something like Disneyland-by-the-sea. It WAS very touristic. But here's the catch: the water is warm so you can swim in the ocean without wearing a wetsuit. Who needs tourist attractions when you have the ocean? Also, we walked the full length of Wakiki, and although Hilton Hawaii Village is at the end, it really has the nicest beach. Finally, I was worried that I would be surrounded by gorgeous women in bikinis and as a result just feel my full fifty year, but I was pleasantly surprised that the people on the beach came in all shapes and sizes.So about the hotel: the room was nice. An ocean view would have been great, but I was not in the room that much, so I don't think it would be worth paying the extra for an ocean view. It was somewhat generic, but pleasant. I think it would be a fun place to go with my family. It also could be pretty romantic, but not recommended if you are going for an authentic, close-to-nature tropical vacation. Or if you are girl watching.

<Content>Great resort!!! This place is huge!!! Only one of two resorts actually located with beachfront property (Sheraton was the only other one I saw on the beach...everything else seemed to be across the street).We stayed on the 34th floor of the Tapa Tower. We booked a ocean view and that was about it...a view...mostly city. Had to go to the far corner of the lanai to see the ocen or view it from inside the room out another window.Huge room, kind of laid out strangely but really spacious with a bar space and dressing area outside the bathroom.Room service was tasty and prompt.More people than I would have liked to have seen in one area unlike our stay in Maui, but that is no fault of the hotel...the entire Waikiki Beach area is way overcrowded anyways. The Hilton Villiage is a little further away from the rest of the big crowds and is less rowdy, although it was hard to get onto the beach due to the number of people on the grounds.Located in close walking distance to the main drag with the rest of the resorts and around the corner from other restaurants. Forget the walk to the other resorts and just stay here...Rainbow Bazaar with all it shops and restaurants located on the grounds between all the other towers makes this a must-stay location.

<Content>Hugh Resort We stayed at The Hilton from the 2nd - 9th November as part of our Honeymoon. We stayed in the Tapa Tower on the 18th floor. The resort itself is hugh and ideally located for Waikiki beach. There are plenty of shops, restaurants and bars in the resort if you choose to eat and drink in the resort. The food and drink is quite pricey and we chose to eat in the various restaurants and bars along the main street. We would highly recommend Wailanna' s a 24 hour diner which is about a 1 minute walk from the gates of the resort. The food here was lovely and extremely cheap. we had dinner there twice and enjoyed a nice few beers while we were there. There is also a bar on the Waterfront called the Harbour Bar which was also very reasonable.The resort is spotless and we never had any problems getting seats by the pool. The ABC shop on sight is also very handy.The room itself was spotless however there are works going on across from this tower. If you were to sit on the balcony during the day you would be looking straight across at anconstruction site and it was quite noisy. There is a shoppping centre Alamona (I think) and you can get a trolley to it for $2. Its worth a look.

<Content>Reliable hotel, great ammenities Have stayed here before on another occasion. It is a great hotel for Waikiki. At the end of the beach so not in the midst of the beach crowd so the beach in front of this hotel is comfortable. That said, the hotel is huge, with every amenity you would want. Tons of shopping, some great pools, though they get busy by late morning. We stayed in the tower that had it's own pool area and I do recommend that as it was less crowded. I would splurge next time for an ocean view room, we had garden view, it was nice, but come on, you're in Hawaii, if you can just do it. There was a bar and eating area at this pool as well so it was the perfect place to spend the day. It is a walk to downtown Waikiki, about 15 minutes or so. Nice to be away from the crowd a bit. I am not a huge fan of Waikiki because of the crowds, but I think this hotel helps make it a more comfortable stay.

<Content>Peaceful, friendly, welcoming, and SO SO SO warm! Such a friendly place to stay, everyone had smiles to exchange! Our room was on the 7th floor of the Kalia tower - it certainly wasn't the biggest room we've stayed in, but was clean and comfortable for the 4 of us.We didn't eat at any of the restaurants on site at the hotel - choosing instead to eat at McDonalds and Subway across the street, and getting coffee and snacks at the ABC store at the Hilton.All of the pools were remarkably clean, and were not once over-crowded. The show and fireworks on Friday night are spectacular.For fellow shoppers, the Ala Moana shopping centre is a short (10m) Wikiwiki drive away - $2 each way. (We thought we overheard the driver saying that it's free on showing your hotel key, I didn't get a chance to confirm this - was our last day. Definitely worth checking out though) Many buses also go to the centre (pick up at same place as Wikiwiki) $1 per trip and ask for a transfer as can be used for the return trip up to 4 hours later.The International Market Place at Waikiki is a great place to pick up jewellery at a fraction of the price at the mall or Hilton. Exact same items for under half the price.Would definitely stay again! :0)

<Content>Ali'i Tower much superior, Diamond head nothing special I just returned from HHV. I stayed in the Diamond Head Tower, and spent 1 night in Ali'i Tower and used its facilities for the rest of the stay. Both of these towers were away from construction, which you could hear during the day even from these towers so would not want to be any closer. The differences btwn the towers was shocking. Ali'i- much better bathroom, newer furniture, newer HVAC system, nice private pool and gym with free apps at night by pool. Diamond head- halls not air conditioned, old HVAC in room with one vent on far side of room so bathroom was always hot, furniture in room and on patio not nearly as nice as Ali'i, tv not as nice, bathroom about half the size of Ali'i. As everyone said, food and drinks very expensive. Only good meal with some flavor was at Bali by the Sea (make reservation and don't wear shorts). Front desk staff unhelpful and rather dim overall only once did I speak to someone who was helpful! My friend and I asked for late check out. I was given 12pm, he was given 3pm. I was told no late check out for hilton honors members, he was told something different. When I asked asst. mang., I was told he gets 3pm and I get 12pm and that was it! HHV's beach and pools much nicer than any of the other hotels. I walked entire beach, which at times was maybe 12 feet wide by other hotels. The HHV protected its beach so not rocky and very wide. Seemed to be place where locals went for beach too. There was lovely live music everynight and the grounds were beautiful, but a bit packaged and a lot of kids, even in nice restaurants.

<Content>A massive, wonderful resort! Amazing service. My wife and I returned from 5 nights at the HHV yesterday, and we couldn't be happier with the resort. We were on the 34th floor of the Tapa Tower and were upgraded to a partial ocean view room (really was a full ocean view in our opinion), that was quite large. Yes, the resort is a little pricey (especially the drinks), but you can get around this partially by buying drinks and breakfast in the ABC store on the property. The only thing that really bugged me was paying for local calls.The service is top notch in all respects. We were especially happy with the Hilton Grand Vacation Club staff (Reinna), and the entire team at Bali By the Sea (one of the best meals, if not the best, I have ever had). Because the Hilton has its own section of the beach and is on one end of Waikiki, the beach is much less crowded than in front of the other Waikiki beach hotels (where you are lucky to see the sand). You could spend your entire vacation on the property and never eat in the same restaurant or shop in the same store twice, it is really like a Vegas resort (without the gambling). We would definitely go back and recommend to anyone (other than the very frugal).

<Content>Pleased with our recent stay at HHV I stayed here recently for a night with my husband and 7 month old daughter during a busy Veterans' Day weekend. From the moment we checked in, we experienced nothing less than outstanding customer service. With our HHilton Rewards, we were upgraded to an ocean view room on the top floor of the Tapa Tower (we requested a king, but to get this room, we had to settle for two doubles). Our room had an incredible Diamondhead view- was nicely appointed with a seating area, bar/fridge, huge closet space, etc. There really is a nice variety of activities and restaurants on-site which does give it a Disney Worldish feeling for those who don't want to venture off-site. Yes, it is expensive, but you're in Hawaii and in all honesty, there are plenty of other resorts that charge way more than what you see here at the HHV. We ate breakfast at CJ's Deli which we highly recommend. Valet and bell service were top-notch for us. Would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone coming to Oahu that doesn't want to spend an arm and a leg to stay at a 5-star resort, but have a comfortable stay in a clean room with access to a pretty decent beach.

<Content>disappointing Was on the 31st floor of the Rainbow tower. Decor and furnishings are right from the 1970s. Walls are paper-thin - was kept awake by a crying baby next door. Hot water took about 20 mins to arrive. Extractor fan in the ceiling was full of hair. If I had been paying any more than the conference rate, I'd be upset! Very disappointing

<Content>Very nice property My son and I were in Oahu for a conference and stayed at this property for a great rate. Our room was in the Diamondhead Tower on the 13th floor with a garden view. We actually had quite a good view of the beach and ocean from our lenai. The room was very comfortable and quiet. The only problem that I had with the room was that the bedding (pillows and comforter) were down filled. Since I am allergic to down, I woke up stuffy. I made a call and the maid switched them out for me which solved the problem. Our room was directly across from the elevators and we did not hear a thing. The beach was right outside our tower and there was a very nice beachside restaurant just around the corner from us. The pools were nice and the beach is excellent. My son is 19 and was quite comfortable wandering around here. Plenty of room and so relaxing. It was expensive and you had to pay for everything, but the property has a lot of overhead. The parking garage was quite full and it was a hike from there to our tower, but our party of five worked well with a minivan. Parking stalls are smaller, but we had no difficulty parking the minivan. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Fabulous!!!!!!! My husband and I stayed 5 nights at HHV 10/25/2007. The second we arrived we were treated like royalty. Our room was perfect, just as we requested it Rainbow Tower Ocean View and a king size bed. The fireworks were lierally on our balcony!! The service was exceptional all around. Some resturants were a bit pricey but the food and service were well worth it. The drinks were great and best of all there were plenty of things to do there. Everyone was so helpful...we even renewed our vows there. We have nothing but good things to say and we will definatly be back and will refer to all considering going to Oahu.

<Content>Wow!!!! Me and my friend stayed at the Hilton Oct 12 thru Oct 15. And then we took a 7 day cruise with NCl. Once returning to Honolulu we stayed at the Hilton Oct 22 thru Oct 26.

WOW! Just wonderful. The shops were wonderful. The food at the Tropica was Great. The beach was wonderful. Had a wonderful time. The food was a bit pricey. But affordable.

<Content>Relaxing Hilton Hawaian Village We stayed 10/27-11/3/07 and had a relaxing week. First of all for an unknown reason we were upgraded to the Ali'i Tower which was an unexpected surprise, only we were put in a groundfloor room with no view. A move would have meant a different tower and we decided to stay in the Ali'i for it's proximity to the beach and the tower's exclusive pool and terrace overlooking the beach and ocean. The room was quite comfortable, can't complain about that, and it was huge.As per other reviews on Trip Advisor, the prices for food and drink are ridiculously overpriced.The stretch of beach in front of the hotel can't be beat and overall it was a wonderful vacation.

<Content>Great Place in Honolulu After a disappointing stay at another hotel, we drove to the Hilton, and we are so glad we did. Everything was wonderful: price of the room, service, room, pools, beach, restaurants. Service, in particular, was wonderful; not always the case with American hotels. The Hilton is so large that it offers many choices for dining, along a wide range of prices. Other luxury hotels often require us to eat only in their high priced restaurant. If you want a hotel on the beach, this is the place: lively where you want it, quiet where you need it.

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian Was Great!!!! My husband  I went to Oahu for our 1 year anniversary, and to renew our wedding vows. We decided to stay here because of a great discount we received on our stay. Well... we were not disappointed.. Check in was fast and efficient.... The room was on the 11th floor, and the room was very nice... The hotel was definitely a little village.... I mean there was nothing you could possibly not find on the hotel's grounds... The staff were extremely nice, we did order room service the first night and didn't do that anymore.. It was so expensive, $70 for two sandwiches and two sodas.. We ate at a great diner across from the hotel for breakfast every morning, it was wonderful... We also ate at the Japanese steakhouse and sushi restaurant at the hotel, and both places the food was wonderful... Very reasonably priced... The room attendants were wonderful also, everyday we came back from our busy day, our room was exceptionally clean, and neat.... Anyway, this was a great time, our renewal vow ceremony was great... If anyone on here is looking to renew their vows or getting married, visit: [--]This company was wonderful also.. All in all, the hotel was great, the weather was great, the Paradise Cove luau was great... This was the best trip I have ever been on.. And we can't wait to go back and visit the Hilton Hawaiian Village...

<Content>Just brilliant This hotel is a little overwhelming at first due to the sheer scale of the complex, number of towers, and height of the towers. But once we settled in, it was utterly fantastic. The staff can't do enough for you, the location is tremendous, you are in utter luxury, the rooms are fantastic, and the pools and beaches are picture perfect. Take advantage of all the facilities, but make sure you also walk out of the complex as there is so much more to see! Try Dukes for great food and drinks at a bar overlooking the beach. Eggs 'n' Things is my favourite diner in the world, and 3 minutes from the hotel entrance. And definately walk the couple of blocks to Ala Moana shopping centre, to catch a bus for $2 which takes you to anywhere on the island! Get the bus up to the North Shore for the legendary surfing; also go across the island to the Windward Coast for white sand beaches. For the latter journey you have to change to the number 70 bus (opposite a shopping centre and book shop) which is fairly infrequent, so grab a timetable for the return service! But well worth the effort.

<Content>Heavenly Hilton My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village prior to taking a NCL Pride Of Hawaii Cruise.I have a Hiltons Honors AX Card--easiest card to earn miles and free rooms I have ever used. We had enough for 3 nts.First awesome thing. I checked us in at the airport. There is a kiosk at the baggage area. My husband picked up our luggage and I checked us in and got our room key and we were on our way in less than 20 minutes. It was awesome! There was a person at the kiosk to help and she asked me if we would like an upgrade, of course , I said yesWe got to the hotel , went direct to our room. We were on the 11th floor oceanfront. My hats off to Hilton, they do their freebies with class.There was a concierge floor that offered a huge breakfast buffet, luncheon, and snacks in late afternoon. We did not eat on the property as it was rather pricey and we figured we would be getting great food on the ship. Just a hint. Walk out to the main road and go to your left. About 3 blocks away is a family style restaurant that is very reasonable.Our room--large area, with a very large patio. The bathroom had a walk in shower-very handicap accessible. Also a bathtub.The grounds are beautiful. The hotel is constantly upgrading but they are very good at keeping any construction away from the guests.Hawaii is such a paradise. This was a great way to start our trip

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian I just returned from 2 weeks at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, and it was a truly wonderful experience. I've been there before, and it is very separate from the noise and franchise food world of Waikiki. It is also a very good value. Before leaving, I priced several other hotels, all of which charged either nearly as much or more, and none of which had the trees, plants, birds, fish, the gracious amenities of the Hilton. There are multiple pools, shops and restaurants, and so always someplace to go.One problem both at the Hilton and elsewhere on Waikiki is the ongoing construction. However, even with an ocean-view room, the construction was off to the side and generally not that noisy. Hawaii itself is lovely, and a great place to visit, and well worth the trip from the continental US.

<Content>This place is gorgeous This place is gorgeous. There is so much to see and do here that you never really need to leave this resort. It was great for a famliy with kids...probably not so great for a romantic getaway as a couple.Before I went to this resort I checked out many of the trip advisor reviews, and made a list of helpful hints. Here are the ones that were MOST useful to me....While sitting poolside, dash over to buy snacks at the miitary resort poolside snack bar next door. It's MUCH cheaper, and literally just steps away down the boardwalk. The food was great.The ceasar salad from the pizza joint on-site was awesome, and a nice poolside snack in the afternoon.The food at this resort is VERY expensive.....the 24 hour coffee place (Wailana?) on the corner outside the resort was cheap with great food! That was our best hint. NICE and cheap breakfasts!Walmart was the place to go for presents. For example, an $11 coconut bra was $2.50 at Walmart. Everything I saw in the gift shops on-site that I wanted I could find at Walmart.We used a limo service to get from the airport to the resort and back. Mr. Melvin Kim of ABC limo service was fantastic. We booked on-line with him after reading some on-line reviews and we were not disappointed. He showed up on time, brought nice leis (not the cheap ugly ones...but the nice purple ones that smell fantastic). Mr. Kim's limo was clean, the snacks and drinks were exactly as described, and he was on-time and reliable.One thing we also loved...you can book a suite to use for an hour on the day you check out. You can check out, leave your luggage with the hotel...play on the beach all day...then re-claim your luggage and go to a room and get cleaned up. Make sure you book this in advance...they don't seem to publicize this service.....but it's available and fantastic to get cleaned up before you travel home.Oh, and for the kids...bring your inflatables and buckets and shovels with you. They are really expensive to buy them at the resort and you can just pack stuff from the dollar store before you leave home and leave it behind for others to play with.

<Content>Village feels like Home My wife and I stayed at HHV Oct.3rd - 6th, my only wish was for us to stay longer. We had an Ocean front room in the Rainbow Tower on the 8th floor. The view was perfect for sunset and we enjoyed every moment on the property. We had breakfast in the Rainbow buffet a couple of mornings it was great. My wife and I are Diamond Members and HGVC owners, but on this trip I was using Points so the breakfast was discounted for only $5; we ate from the entire buffet and there was plenty and more. One morning we ate at the Tapa Tower breakfast area it was good as well; less selection that Rainbow though. We ate at the round table pizza place, it was good as always. We have stayed at HHV now 7 times and each seems like a trip to our second home. Well, in fact it is our second home and we both love this place. I would gladly recommend anyone to stay here. There is plenty to do, the beach is right in front of the property. The grounds are well taken care of, and the staff was great. The only problem we had was one evening we went to the tropics bar for a late snack, and we were informed incorrectly that the place was closed at 7:30 pm when in fact it closed at 8:00 pm. We spoke with the manager and she spoke to the staff about this. She was very nice and gave us a $50 credit for our stay, which ended up paying for most of our parking. Finally, we had a great time and enjoyed our stay at HHV yet again. Thank You HHV for a great trip back home.

<Content>HHV I cashed in my HH points for a stay at the HHV. This place really buzzes and not in good way. It was okay, just too damn crowded for my taste. This isn't what I consider paradise. We had an ocean/Diamond head room and that was lovely. The paper thin walls and constant screaming from next door was not. Breakfast at the rainbow lanai was good, dinner at the Golden Dragon was mediocre.Staff was nice - if you can get to them. I understand that its the busy season, but so should the hotel. If you at capacity make sure you staff is too.If I had to stay in Waikiki/Honolulu again I鈥檇 probably consider going to the Embassy Suites. It鈥檚 not on the beach like the HHV, but you鈥檒l get some actual quite time.

<Content>Hilton Hawiian resort What can i say ?We travelled here in march 2006 for a 15 night stay but ended up extending to 20 nights!This is just such a beautful hotel!Very, very clean. Everything you would expect from a high class hotel as this!As soon as i told staff i was allergic to feather pillows, within minutes they had two maids changing the bedding which was of course lovely and was changed everyday as i would expect.We travelled there with our two children (11 and 13) for 20 nights and they upgraded us to a beautful suite. We were in Tapa tower, about the 30th something floor, two balconies.one over looking the ocean the other the city.....just beautful!During the day they have lots gong on HULU dancers etc..Friday night the show they put on is just fantastic, with dancers telling their stories and the firesworks.well what can i say?We did get a better view from our balconie though as tourist will be tourist and only think about themselves!I am disabled but then again, no matter where you go in the world the tourists always think of themselves!The hotel staff were wonderful at all times and went out of their way many times to accomodate any requests!Mind you, not that we needed to ask for much.Only complaint...it is expensive to stay on hotel grounds for food and clothes all the time..etc. so sometimes look for a nice clean restaurant of the grounds.Also it would have been nice to have had a microwave and kettle in the suite instead of just the coffee makers!I hate coffee!I must also admit that i found it rather insulting having to pay for hot chocolate that was in the suite, if we used it.When i did complain they then gave me it complementry!I did miss my morning cuppa but of course just being here was enough but it would have been nice to make a cup of hot decent tea but then you cannot do that anywhere outside of England!I am the first person to find fault with anything but Hawaii and the Hilton is just paradise!If anyone says different then im sorry but they just like to moan lol and i thought i was bad!We will defently be going back there and the hotel will be the Hilton Hawiian!So much to do or just relax and the kids loved it!Just to much to praise that it would take me forever! lolWe will be returning ASAP!

<Content>Best resort to stay at in Honolulu We stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village every year we go to Hawaii . We have stayed at a few others to save a buck, but were never happy. We always go back to the Hilton resort. The service is excellant and the night manager Gerald Chun is the most helpful and kind manager we have ever come into contact with. The rooms are always well above average and the view (which is very important to us) is to die for. There is always something to do and it is centrally located for other activites off the resort. We will always stay at the Hilton.

<Content>Beautiful but NOT customer friendly (hotel is too thrifty trying to save money) Well its a very beautiful place but thats where it stops !!!!! EXPENSIVE get your checkbook out on this one 2 Pina Coladas $20 for instance. The room was ok BUT motion sensors on the air conditioner thermostat (black window in the upper corner of thermostat). Your room MUST HAVE constant movement to keep the a/c blowing cold, leave come back to a hot room, don't toss and turn in your sleep =hot room at night and you wake up sweating. Had to hang luggage tags in front of th vent to blow in the wind to create motion to keep cool. This is NOT customer friendly WE PAY for a cool room and don't get it do to them being cheap.NO drinking on their beach either !!!!! If you are thinking of sunning with a umbrella drink forget it !!!!!! No Mai Tai on the beach for you. But it is a smoking area go figure ?????Food was ok, Drinks were good as were the valet and bellmen. The front desk staff were nice but guest services were rude.

<Content>Love the Resort...Stay away from the Spa This was my second time staying at the Village. My daughter and I stayed in the Rainbow Tower on the 15th floor in an oceanfront room...We arrived just in time to watch the Blue Angels from our lanai and then there was the fireworks show that night. We couldn't have asked for a better welcome. The nightly entertainment was fantastic and you would be hard pressed to find better musicians anywhere. We walked around the village all night wanting to soak it all in. The beach can't be beat. Even though the hotel was completely booked, you really don't feel like the resort is overcrowded. Plenty of open space. The only negative I can say is that the receptionist at the spa was very rude. Even though I spent a pretty good chunk of money at the spa, I was treated with disrespect. At one point, after waiting for 15 minutes for someone to come to the counter so that I could request a robe in the spa, the girl rudely said I am not an octopus and can't do everything, you'll just have to wait. Now that was after already waiting for 15 minutes and I had to check out of the hotel within 2 hours and was running out of time. So, while she was on the phone FOREVER....I reached behind the counter and retrieved my own robe so I could get on with using the spa. Then the girl actually started yelling at me and at that point, I told her I wasn't going to take this kind of treatment and left. I reported her to the HHV manager on duty and they were great. They offered to pay for our breakfast that morning and apologized for the treatment in the Spa. We still felt that the spa should do something about this employee but I was too upset to talk to the manager at the spa so my daughter did this for me. She recieved absolutely no satisfaction from the manager. They took no responsibility for their employee's actions and could care less whether I was satisfied or not. Thank goodness the Hilton corrected this and took the liability on themselves. They even told me that there were other spas OFF-SITE that they recommended would give much better service and apologized for the spa on site. So, overall, I would highly recommend the Village but stay away from the spa. I am glad to say that I didn't let them ruin an almost perfect vacation.

<Content>Overrated We recently returned from Honolulu and was somewhat disappointed with the Hilton. We stayed there to attend a conference. The checkin was slow. We had requested a king bed but they suddenly didn't have any. After having them check further we finally go what we had requested and what the hotel had confirmed. The rooms were nice but show some wear. The maids were inconsistent in making up the rooms. The complex is large and can be confusing to get around. We have stayed at many 5 and 4 star hotels and this complex rides on its reputation and I would not rate it above a 3. They do not give you robes and you have to pay for the safe.

<Content>Very Nice, but very pricey We stayed in Honolulu at the Hilton Hawaiian Village the first 4 nights of our trip, since my wife was attending a seminar for her work. The Hilton is very nice, with several high-rise buildings for lodging and a very extensive shopping and restaurant selection. Waikaki Beach is quite beautiful and the view of Diamond Head breathtaking. One thing that is important. The Hilton and the shops and restaurants are VERY expensive. Be forewarned, if you stay there.

<Content>a thing of beauty... we stayed at the rainbow tower of the hilton village and the view is spectacular from our terrace wether it be day or night. beach is best for families with kids and the restaurants are well recommended. service is excellent from the valet, to guest relations and housekeeping. if you're not sure where to go, just talk to one of the valet people and they will suggest local areas to dine and shop. thanks to jade, roland, makita, tony, maricel. if i do visit again, hawaii-hilton village would be my preference.

<Content>Loved it !! We stayed in the Hilton's Ali Tower for 5 nights as part of our honeymoon. I don't know about the rest of the towers but I recommend that if your on honeymoon that this is the only tower to stay in. We stayed in a 5 star hotel in las vegas before we reach oahu and it wasn't a patch on the service we received in the Ali Tower. The room might not have been as fancy as a five star room but it was without doubt more comfortable and we loved it. We were upgraded from a garden view to ocean view and received cava and fruit on arrival. The beach at the hilton is lovely and not so crowded and if you go to the bar between the super pool and beach you'll get some great service and a laugh !! If your idea of a honeymoon is being on a desserted island than its probably not for you but if you like a more lively honeymoon with paradise thrown in, its great.

<Content>Good for families, not great for honeymooners My husband and I planned to spend four romantic days in Waikiki, but this wasn't what we expected. The Hilton is just like a village--a large property of 3,000 rooms, many shops and restaurants, and lots of families. It may not be what honeymooners are looking for: It's low on charm--the shops give it a very mall-like feel; it's a very family-friendly place, which means little kids are everywhere; and it's quite noisy--we could hear children squealing with delight over video games next door, people in the hallway, toilets flushing in the middle of the night... We actually left the next day. To their credit, the hotel is very clean and the staff is extremely cordial and helpful. Maybe we'll go back for our fourth honeymoon with our future kids ;)

<Content>Ali'i Tower Stayed at HHV last week of August in the Ali'i Tower. The accomodations and service were excellent. Booked a Garden View and was upgraded to an oceanview on the 3rd floor. We asked for a higher floor and although the hotel was full they called us the next morning and gave us a 10th floor room with a spectacular view.The hotel food and beverages were very overpriced so we walked along the beach each night and went to a different restaurant........the best were......Orchid, Ocean House and of course Dukes. There were also some nice bars with music at the Royal Hawaiian and Sandshore. We did eat at The Bali Restuarant at the hotel and it was worth the price.......our best meal and service on the trip.Renatal cars........Hertz at the hotel was a total ripoff $140 for a sub-compact. We used Enterprise....$39 for a convertible......Dollar also had good prices and they both pick you up and drop you off at the hotel. Traffic is horrendous in Honolulu 3 days was enough for me and I live in NJ!Parking.........plenty of FREE parking in front of the lagoon right at the beach....just as far from the Ali'i tower as the parking garage.Internet...........many free wireless connections although service was spotty.........CJ's deli in the village has it's own free wi-fi.Breakfast.........Wailana Coffe House across the street from the entrance was great and affordable......we even met one of the stars from LOST eating breakfast there.Teens........we had 2 teens with us........besides all the beach activity (the surfing lessons were their highlight) there wasn't much for them to do or anywhere to meet other teens......no arcade,gameroom or organized activities....the only drawback to the trip.All in all it's a well run property and the grounds were maintained meticulously. There were always seats by the pools, towels and no service problems. Cocktail hour at the Alii tower was a nice perk. You won't be disappointed staying at this hotel.

<Content>Good Beach...but not a Great Hotel My fiance and I stayed here for a week in July. We had stayed here once before 2 years ago. We were put in the Kalia tower on a high floor but with a view of the city. We had access to the lounge on the top floor which was nice for a decent continental breakfast and evening snacks. Unfortunately the alcoholic drinks still cost money in the lounge which is disappointing! They do have delicious cookies. Staying in the Kalia tower also gives access to a special pool only for guests in this tower...I think the Ali tower also has this benefit. The property itself is huge and in many ways feels like it is designed to get you to shop and spend as much as possible. We avoided all the shops and spent our day on the beach which is the best part of the hotel...it is definitely the nicest/widest section of the Waikiki beach. We never once ate at any of the hotel restaurants as the prices were outrageous, even the drinks are more expensive here than at any other hotel on the beach. We did go to the Coffee Shop across the street a few times and really enjoyed a good and reasonably priced meal. Its an easy walk from the hotel to the main part of Waikiki and we even walked all the way to Diamond Head and back. The hotel in nice overall but I think its a bit overpriced for what you get although I think it would be great with families.

<Content>Great hotel and Service but.... My husband and I booked the Hilton for our honeymoon, and it was a great stay. We rented a car to get out of Waikiki and see the island which was the best advice we could have gotten. The cars in Hawaii are super cheap to rent compared to mainland standards, however the Hilton charges $20 PER DAY to park in their lot, and there is NO parking anywhere else around Waikiki unless you want your car broken into...Other than that, the Hilton was fabulous, and the friday night fireworks were not to be missed. The shops inside the complex were overpriced, but other shops werent far away. Overall a very classy establishment with great service. We had to call security to open our safe at one point, and it only took them 5 min to arrive- it was very impressive. I dont think we'd stay there again- as we much preferred the North Shore to Waikiki, but its definitly a nice place to stay in Waikiki.

<Content>Wonderful Resort. Loved it! The Hilton Hawaiian Village surpassed my expectations. I had a wonderful room in the Rainbow Tower that was an upgrade to an ocean view. I was pleasantly surprised since I booked on the website for Hilton and did not express a preference.The staff was courteous and efficient. Check in was swift.The pool contrary to earlier reports wasn't crowded at all and neither was the beach. Due to jet lag I was up at 4 am and they actually comb and rake the beach every night before the guests use it. Staff is up then too to prepare for the 6 am breakfast crowd.The cons, food is outrageous. Do go to the diner across the street. The food is good and inexpensive and the service is great.If you like chains, Outback and Red Lobster are around the corner and a block down the street. They may serve the same fare cheaper.The mats for $2 at the package store are all you need for the beach. I cannot see having to pay for a beach chair at a Hilton resort. The hospitality suite they gave us to use before we flew out was dirty and wet towels and used toiletries were all over the bathroom floor. Shame on you Hilton!But, other than that I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will recommend the resort to friends.

<Content>Nice Property but hidden Expenses Very nice property as it was very pretty and well maintained. However there were lots of hidden costs. If you wanted a lounge chair you needed to rent it for the day at $12.00 and an umbrella was an extra charge on top of that .The gym also cost $12.00 to use per day and if you wanted to shower afterwards it was more money. Coffee in the room was $5.00 per day.

<Content>Very Convenient. Great Service. Just got back from a 6 nite stay in the Ali Towers at HHV. Was upgraded to an oceanview room upon arrival. Daily breakfast was also included as well as one 3-course lunch for our party. Amex Platinum service also guarantees 4 pm check-out which worked out perfectly b/c I had a mid-afternoon flight. We didn't have to rush to pack and check-out before noon.The rooms were spacious and clean. Definitely looks better than some of the pictures I have seen on TA. The Ali towers has it's own pool on the 2nd floor, which can only be accessed w/ your room key. I can't get over how courteous everyone was. The staff was always more than will to help. I frequent high end hotels like the Ritz and 4 Seasons. The rooms and facilities at HHV may not be of the same par but the service definitely was. Large property with many stores and 4 pools. The beach isn't as packed as the one shared by many hotels on the Waikiki strip.Location was very convenient and central. We were within walking distance to everything but yet away from the hustle and bustle of Kalakaua Avenue in Waikiki. Just a short 2 min. drive away but what a world of difference. All in all, we had a great stay.

<Content>Nice Hotel, So-So Beach The Hilton Hawaiian Village is a very nice hotel. It is enormous, with lots of restaurants and pools. However, we were disappointed with the area. Waikiki Beach was crowded, so not very relaxing. There was also a lot of traffic around the hotel. From our lanai we heard buses and cars. The hotel is great, but I wouldn't go back to Honolulu.

<Content>very gourgeous but pricy We just came back from Hilton Hawaii Village, it was really beatiful and the beach is gourgeous. The rooms are nice, a little small. We stayed at Kalia tower, it was nice and quite. There is a lot of construction going on, but it was not noisy. The rainbow tower is nice it has ocean view, but very expensive. The other side of rainbow tower has construction view. The Allie tower is right on the beach. The only negative are the price, they are tooo high for everything. The food in the hotel is expensive. The canned soda is $2.00 but if you go to the bar and ask for soda it's $8.00!!!!!. We spend all of our money on food and entertainment. Nothing there is free. Going to the beach costs $62.00 a day for umbrella and other stuff. But it was nice, just bring a lot of money with you.

<Content>Not my Style, but still Nice We stayed here for two days on our way back from Maui and linked up with our family who were also in HI at the time. They chose the hotel. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower. The room was very nice with a decent view. It had a small refrigerator, which was nice. The resort is lovely and the grounds very well kept. We used both the pool and the beach in front of the resort. The prices on resort seemed very high for things like bottled water and food, but this is not atypical of resorts. The stores were often very crowded. I would not stay here again unless I had kids. I prefer to stay in smaller places that give you more of a local feel. This resort feels largely like, disney does Hawaii. I am sure it is exactly what many people want. It's just not really my style. We don't normally stay at national chain hotels for that reason. You could happily stay on property for a week on Honolulu at this resort.

<Content>Great Hotel I had the pleasure of staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort for one night prior to boarding a ship for a Hawaiian cruise. The hotel was wonderful! Immaculate rooms, the bed was like sleeping on a cloud and the staff was great. I would love to go back and stay at the hotel for a full vacation. I especially loved the location-right on the beach. We had a party of nine and all were very satisfied with the accommodations. First class all the way.

<Content>Great Hotel but expensive! We just returned from our stay at the HHV in Oahu. I have to say the hotel is really nice. We were able to get there early enough in the day to get a upgrade room. We had a nice view of Diamond Head and the beach/ocean. Be careful about getting there late in the day. The gentelman checking us in said they typically OVERBOOK in the summer months. People arriving late run the risk of not having a room. I asked the guy what happens in that case and he said they put you in another hotel till a room is open. That would greatly irritate me! I think we got very lucky! We did eat at the hotel occasionlly. Be aware any meal you eat there will be very expensive. This is not a budget friendly hotel! My husband overed a beer glass of wine and a pina colada and it was $27.00. After that bill I walked to the ABC store on the property and bought drinks for the room and a few snacks. That was much cheaper. We would stay there agian anyday now that we are prepared for the prices.

<Content>Recent Visit to Hilton Hawaiian Village Just returned from the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Very much enjoyed our stay. Oceanfront rooms in Rainbow Tower recently renovated and with fabulous views. Construction noise mildly annoying at the beach. Service and food in all restaurants very good (Rainbow Grill, Village Steak, Benihana, Sergios, Tapa Grill, Round House Pizza, New York Deli). Common areas, Pool and beach somewhat crowded. However, this is a particularly lovely stretch of beach with great waves for children. My kids (10 and 14) couldn't get enough of it. Wish big pool were open at night . Overall, best hotel on Waikiki beach for families from what I could see. /If you're interested in the fanciest restaurants (golden Dragon and Bali by the Sea) men must have long pants.

<Content>Bold, Busy, Behemoth We stayed in the HGVC Lagoon Tower Christmas 2006 for three days, and also Christmas 2004 in the HGVC Kalia Tower, and in 2002 in the hotel section at the Alii Tower.. If you are thinking that this is going to be some remote, quiet island destination, just stop that train right here. The name Hilton Hawaiian Village is not a misnomer. There are thousands of guests staying there at the same time you are, housed in about 5 different buildings of differing ages and proximity to the sea. The check in line kind of looks like a bank during lunch hour, with ropes herding the crowds into orderly snake-like lines. But once you're up, they get you check in pretty quickly.The newer, Kalia Tower is furthest from the beach, but has the beautiful granite countertops in its kitchen and new furniture and great high tread count sheets in its one bedroom units. The dining and sitting areas were just right for our family, The Lagoon tower is a bit older, but the 2 bedroom units are really spacious for a family of 4 and equipped with full kitchens and generous size eating areas. The Alii tower is like a small upscale hotel within the village right next to the beach and the executive room we had was huge. Each of these buildings have their own pool, which means you don't have to brave the crowds in the super pool in the center of the village. Watch out for penquin droppings along the way...The rooms themselves felt upscale, spacious, squeaky clean, furnished with fairly recently bought furniture, and well maintained, but the service was predictably kind of slow. It would take the bell people a good 20-30 minutes to come get our luggage (with a family of small children, we're like a baggage train from Accra minus the camels) and getting housekeeping to come empty the garbage might mean a half day wait. Getting our car out of valet parking has taken as long as 30 minutes at the Lagoon Tower. Otherwise the service is courteous and willing to help.The Village has restaurants at all price points, convenience stores, gift shops, and a couple high end luxury shops. If this doesn't satisfy your need to consume, the Ala Moana Mall is only short walk away, since this Village is located on the shopping/hotel strip of Waikiki. If you're willing to drive a bit, snorkelling at Hanauma Bay or swimming (kind of dangerously) at Sandy beach is not far. Of course, the hotel property has tis own slightly rocky beach (bring water shoes), so that is always easy. The location and the facilities offered created a lot of convenience for us.The Mandara Spa offered typical body and face services and the women's sauna was quite good. Massages were diappointingly weak--more in the style of a gentle Swedish with scented candles and body oils rather than a tissue searing Shiatsu. Relaxing but ephemeral.Clearly, we like the place as we keep coming back. It is perfect for families with children that don't want to do much more than play in the sand, swim, and occasionally take a walk around.

<Content>The perfect base for a stay on Oahu. Just returned from a ten day stay at this amazing resort.I think anyone who gives the HHV a negative review cannot have done their research thoroughly before booking. Yes it is a big, bustling resort and yes they do 'nickle and dime' you ($3.50 daily rate to use your room safe is just one example). However, we knew all this when we booked but felt the pros outweighed the cons and we were so right.....Arrived at 10pm at night after enduring 24 hours of travelling and jet lagged beyond belief to find we had been upgraded to the Ali'i Tower. Were presented with a lei by concierge before being shown to our room and just collapsed into bed exhausted.Did we get a surprise next day when we woke and opened the curtains, the views were stunning- we had a beach view room and honestly I could have cried it was so beautiful. The Ali'i tower has a very exclusive feel about it, I was very pleased we had been upgraded. Rooms were spacious with a separate dressing area and a small fridge to keep drinks and snacks in. The beds were so comfortable - like sleeping on a cloud. Very efficient and thorough maid service including an evening turn down service - with chocolates. I loved that. The tower has a private pool which can only be accessed with your room key and a private sea view bar.You do get complimentary coffee and bottled water in your room which I don't think you get in the other towers. A continental breakfast is also served here which we highly recommend. Other restaurants on the resort served both hot and continental breakfast buffets which had a choice of everything you could possibly eat for breakfast - including a full Japanese option.The restaurants are expensive but we had no complaints about the quality of the food, although we only ate on resort a couple of times as we preferred to walk into Waikiki to eat in the evening.The resort itself is breathtakingly beautiful - spotlessly clean - and although there are obviously thousands staying here it is so big it never feels crowded or noisy. I knew there was construction taking place but never once noticed it during our stay.I think the resort is in the best location - right on the edge of Waikiki. In this area the beach is large, quiet and uncrowded - although it is artificial - the sand is from California and if you dig down a couple of inches you hit concrete!Further down the beach, it becomes much narrower, especially at high tide and you literally can barely walk between bodies stretched out in any tiny space available. However, the sand here is real.Waikiki is buzzing at night and I would imagine its quite noisy until late if you are staying at one of the hotels further down the beach. Staying at the HHV, we were only a short walk from all this activity but could escape to the peace of our resort when we wanted - the best of both worlds! One memory that will stay with me for ever is eating at Dukes (amazing salad bar), then taking off our shoes and walking back to the HHV along the beach with the moon shining on the water and savouring the atmosphere of the evening entertainment in the other beach front hotels.Also, as the HHV is on the edge of Waikiki, it is a little easier when driving around as you do not need to battle your way through the traffic of Waikiki to access the rest of the island. Having said that driving here is not a pleasant experience - the whole area is a mass of one way streets and the on/off ramps for the freeways seem to be tucked away at the end of residential streets! Thank goodness we had a Sat Nav system in our car as I don't think we would ever had found our way back to the resort! However, we do recommend hiring a car to sample the beauty of the island.I cannot rate this hotel highly enough - we loved it in every way possible and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Great Resort This resort is fantastic. There is so much to do - relaxing and watching the world go by on the beach or taking a walk through the resort and seeing the penguins, koi fish, etc. We arrived earlier than check in time (11.00a.m.), due to our flight time, and as there wasn't a room available at that time had to wait until 2.00 p.m. to get a room. However, following this delay we did get a free up grade to the Ali'i Tower. The staff were friendly, as were fellow guests. The worst thing about this resort is leaving!

<Content>Interesting Experience The resort is very spacious. There is a lot to see and do in here. Make sure you take a good amount of time to enjoy all the aspects of the resort (animals, art, etc.). This place is great if you're looking for a really relaxing environment. There are many people at the resort, but there is so many places that it never gets crowded (except the elevators maybe). The pool was never crowded (if it is...you always have the beach). They had live music playing in some places at night. It was great to get a chance to sit down and listen to the band play Free Bird!There are so many wonderful things going on at the resort that you really must make sure you have time to just sit back and relax.My only complaints are that the pool closes too early (5:30pm) and some of the hotel attendents (especially around the pool) were not too helpful.

<Content>Wife  My wife and I stayed here for 6 nights, and had an absolutely wonderful time. Not quite up to one or two of the really world-class hotels I've been lucky to visit (the Hilton Jerusalem comes to mind in this chain), but great overall.Our room was a large suite and had an ocean view and two balconies even though it was in one of the lower end towers for this complex, and the upgrade price of the breakfast buffet was well worth it even if just to watch the fish in the gorgeous koi pond (the food was great too). We also had a great late-arrival-from-the-mainland dinner at Benihana (not exactly exotic, but great for US hotel food, and just as importantly was open for a hearty meal even though we arrived after a lot of other things were closed). Didn't try the nicer restaurants there other than for breakfast because we were out and about most nights. The little cafe will make you a reasonable americano in the morning and has good pastries if you're not sticking around for breakfast. Parking our rental motorcycle in the parking lot was also never a problem, and the service was impeccable. The drinks from the beachfront lounge were not exactly strong, but hey, you can't have everything, and what do you expect at a place like this. :-)The hotel is located on one end of the Waikiki beach area, between the hotels-on-the-beach strip and the yacht harbor, and we had a lot of fun just strolling around the area. If you're looking for an easy beach getaway and a hotel staff that are helpful but not intrusive, give it a try. Two thumbs up.

<Content>Loved the whole experience When we arrived we were given an oceanview room. Beware that this accomodation considers a partial oceanview to be oceanview. If you can look over your balcony and see any water, it's considered ocean view. After 12 hours in and out of airplanes to get there, I cried when I got to my room! Literally. I was extremely disappointed. My husband told me immediately to step into the bathroom and shut the door. I was oblivious to the fact that he was having to catch a 4-5 inch bug in our room! He put it in a baggie and we immediately took it to the front desk and expressed our disgust for the room. The night manager worked desperately to find us an accomodation that was adequate for us. She upgraded us quickly to oceanfront accomodations in the Ali'i Tower. While we were waiting for our room to be ready, she gave us a $100 food credit so we could go onto the property and enjoy a meal while waiting. While I was horrified at our first room, it made the ordeal manageable after getting into the Ali'i Tower. If you have the money to spare, absolutely request the Ali'i Tower with an oceanview. I spent hours on the lanai soaking up the view. Kona coffee and that view are enough memories to get through to the next year when you're able to return to the islands. I would recommend this hotel because I should have researched better and realized some hotels consider a partial oceanview room to actually be an oceanview. We loved the property as a whole. We actually seldom left the property itself to do any type of shopping. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ABC STORE! We did it on the massive property given to you by Hilton. This place is my personal recommendation for anyone going to Oahu with no experience on the island.

<Content>Guests as nuisance The facilities of this hotel are o.k. Seemingly one of the better places at Waikiki, but unimpressive in comparison to the resort hotels in South East Asia. We stayed in an ocean front room at the Rainbow Tower at US $ 360 per night. The room was o.k., spacious enough and furnished quite nicely.The food at the 2 restaurants we tried was reasonable and the prices not overly expensive - just in line with what you pay at Waikiki.The major downside of this hotel is the service. Check-in took us 30 minutes, as we became part of a training program for new front desks trainees... After check-in we wanted to go to the beach. Chairs and umbrellas are rental only, at US $ 60 per day for a set of one umbrella and 2 chairs. We passed on this rip-off. And the guys at the beach facility rental desk were dreadfully rude, not only to us, but to other guests too. Chairs at the pool were plentiful, but all occupied, although there are probably 200 chairs arranged auditorium style with no space in between. Well, the only option left to enjoy beach or pool was placing our towels on the sand in the tiny shade of a palm tree. Then we wanted to eat a snack in the poolside 'restaurant'. We sat there unattended for 20 minutes and left without being served.The flaws in service are major. You may expect friendliness only from staff who are supposed to receive tips. The rest are from neutral to extremely rude.Well, we found that the Hilton isn't unique in poor service and attitude. We felt unwelcome almost anywhere we went. In Honolulu tourists are taken for granted and obviously treated as nuisance. Well, we've taken the point and definitely won't return.

<Content>Absolute paradise! We stayed at this hotel for 7 days in July, all I can say is, it's awesome! Go see for yourself and enjoy! There's loads to see and do, the rooms are massive, clean, modern and the staff simply cannot do enough for you. We'll definitely stay there again, yes it's a little bit more expensive than other places for food and drink but a short walk or bus / tram ride - you have everything you want to eat or drink, the shops too are amazing!We got married on the beach in the Kahala district of Honolulu, what a beautiful beach, go there if you want privacy as Waikiki beach can get quite busy. All in all, we found paradise and were sorry we had to leave.

<Content>Great Location on Waikiki My husband and I just returned from a four night stay July 17 - 20, 2007, at the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Waikiki. (HHV) I would first like to say that the hotel was a wonderful facility with a friendly and helpful staff. (I would be remiss in not mentioning the stellar valet parking staff, first rate)We stayed in a garden view room in the Diamond Head Tower on the sixth floor. Our view was not much to talk about, but we knew this when we booked our reservation. We were on a budget and did not expect to spend too much time in our room. Our view was of a park on the grounds of the military hotel next door, the Hale Koa. A service entrance was also below our window and there were times when you could hear the sounds coming from the delivery trucks below. This was only during the day, never at night.Our room was decorated very nicely. I am not sure when this tower was renovated or redone but everything in the room seemed very new. Our king bed was extremely comfortable with a wonderful fluffy duvet and plenty of pillows to match. The room featured a flat screen TV with the usual array of movies and games for purchase at your fingertips. There was a four drawer dresser, desk with lamp and chair, a round table and two chairs situated next to the sliding glass door and a cushioned bench for luggage. The closet was very large and included a iron and ironing board, and a few hangars. There was a safe located in the closet for use for a fee. Near the entrance to the room was a wet bar with a small sink, small refrigerator, and a coffeemaker(Single Pod type). The coffeemaker included the usual suspects of Kona coffees, teas, and condiments. I will note that I had read on some reviews that the hotel charges extra for coffee. It was included (no fee) and refilled daily as we used it. The bathroom as well as the wet bar countertops were either marble or a look alike solid surface. The shower thankfully worked very well with nice pressure even though they have a sign in the bathroom explaining the restricted low flow shower head. (due to the water conservation laws in Hawaii) The tolietries were Crabtree and Evelyn. I absolutely loved the towels. Plenty of bathroom linens,plush, large and spa like. Other amenities included a blow dryer and a mounted makeup mirror on an adjustable arm. (nice touch) We heard very little noise from our neighbors. Maid service was well done except that I think the room was pretty dusty and could use a good dusting. Other than that the room was very clean and in good working condition. I almost forgot to mention the balcony. I believe most if not all rooms have a balcony. Ours included the usual two chairs and small table.I had heard stories about the tenacious Hilton Vacation Club, timeshare employees at the hotel. We were not bothered in person by the timeshare employees during our stay at the hotel. There was a voice mail inviting us to a complimentary breakfast our first morning which was to pitch a tour of the Hilton Vacation Club. There was also a postcard rub off game in our information packet given to us at check in. We did not eat at the Hilton due to the very high prices. The Hilton did have a variety of restaurants for your culinary moods. They had italian, japanese, steakouse, NY deli fare, chinese, seafood, and good ole burgers and sandwiches. A note of interest, the military Hale Koa Hotel next door has a few eateries and an outdoor bar that is legally able to be used by civilians as well as military. This is due to a law in Hawaii that has something to do with public beach access and such. The prices at the Hale Koa are very reasonable. The food is average but tasty. There is a place called Happy's a little further in past the pool that serves, burgers, chicken sandwiches, hot dogs, premade deli sandwiches, salads, fries, drinks, and ice cream. There is also a small step-up to the window type deal that also serves burgers, hot dogs, drinks and shaved ice. There is lots of outdoor seating in these areas plus a park nearby with picnic tables, plenty of shade and a great breeze from the ocean. The bar if you are hankering for an adult beverage is also next to the Hale Koa pool and has prices almost half the price of the ones at the Hilton. My personal favorite was the Lava Flow. Ono - delicious. The beach in front of the hotel was primo. We especially noticed this after visiting many beaches on the island. There were very little rocks located in the surf here, plus the water was pretty calm here. Great for the kids and those of us that just want to float around and relax. Don't worry though, there are plenty of beautiful beaches on the island that are waiting for the brave and risk taking water babies that seek excitement in the surf. There is also a stand that rents, snorkels, floats, kayaks, chairs and umbrellas and the such in front of the hotel. If you walk out to the beach from the hotel and make a left and walk down toward the Hale Koa (yes, that place again) there is a stand that I believe is not part of the Hale Koa Hotel, however, they do give discounts to the military, where you can also rent beach gear and it is a liitle cheaper than the one in front of the HHV. We rented two chairs and an umbrella for the day for $35.00. This also included cushions on the adjustable lounge chairs, and a bucket of ice that they bring for your drinks.In my opinion the HHV is in a great location, especially for families. You are not in the middle of the waikiki beach where it can be very busy and noisy, fun to visit though, and then go back to the Hilton for the night. You are on a calm part of the beach. There is a sidewalk and concrete walkways that front most of the hotels on Waikiki. This makes it alot faster and easier to get to many of the restautrants on the beach. Driving is crazy busy and frustrating with all of the one way streets and parking is expensive. We paid $2.50 for every half hour we parked in a parking garage near the International Market. The penguins and Ibis birds and turtles that they have on the hotel grounds are a crowd pleaser for the younger set. The Friday night Jubilee and Fireworks show that the Hilton puts on isn't shaby either. The hotel is also great for couples. It has a romantic feel especially at night. The lush tropical gardens and flowers that look like they have OD'd on Miracle Grow sprinkled in with the glowing tiki torches and balmy ocean breeze makes it a very nice place to have some couple time while watching the sunset.I know this review has been long, I did feel like this site helped me so much on my trip to Oahu that I just wanted to give something back. I found this site to be very helpful and pretty accurate. Another source that I found to be extremely accurate and right on the mark was the book titled Oahu Revealed by Andrew Doughty and Harriett Friedman. This book had fantastic information, directions and maps and was worth every penny that I paid for it. This website and the book I mentioned helped make my vacation very memorable and they won't lose your luggage!

<Content>great view I really liked the HHV. There were some positives and negatives about our stayPositives: Our room in the Rainbow tower was picture perfect. The ABC store on site was great. The grounds were spotless. We were able to find chairs at the pool. The beach was steps away from pool. They came right away to fix the air when it stopped working. Negatives: The people in the stores on the property are very pushy, and will try a hard sell. Not my style. The HHV people wanted you to eat on site, and not leave to eat, so they would not provide info about places to eat. We eat breakfast across the street everyday. We did like the pizza place on the property and they were not overpriced. I do not think they changed the sheets the entire stay of 7 nights, the room was clean, but they never cleaned the floor. We were not messy people so it was ok, but the maid service could do better.

<Content>Great Resort! My husband and I stayed here for the first part of our honeymoon and were very happy with our choice! We were in the Rainbow Tower (we had already paid for a room in that tower online on their website, the net direct rates), which I agree with other reviews, it is the best tower to be in - it is the only tower right on the beach with the best views! We were on the diamond head view side and never heard any construction. We woke up and fell asleep to the wonderful sound of the ocean! Sitting on the balcony was amazing, the view the sound... You also can't see any construction, they have a wall put up, that you see when you're at the beach so it's not like you see what's happening or feel like you're missing out on the lagoon.We found the staff friendly. They upgraded us to an executive suite in the rainbow tower, so that was a pleasant surprise! The room was huge and had 2 bathrooms! When you check in, if you are a HH member, and if you're not become one online before you go (free and quick), make sure you don't wait in the long check in line, but go to the sign that says HH Members check it! It seriously saved us at least 15 minutes! No lineup there, whereas everyone else was waiting in a long line to check in!Yes, it's a big hotel and whenever you're in the lobby, we did feel a bit like we were at disneyland - always busy! But we didn't spend a lot of time in the lobby. The hotel grounds are nice, the animals on site are very cool! We loved the penguins, flamingos, turtles and fish! We even got to participate in fish feeding, they gave you a little cup of food and you can walk around and feed them! The ABC store is the best value on the property - great prices! The negatives for us: They refused to offer us a late check out, we wanted to check out at noon instead of 11am, but they couldn't accomodate us. That was disappointing.That you have to rent beach chairs if you want them on the beach, they aren't free. We didn't, we bought mats from the ABC store for $2 and lay on the beach - way better and lots of people opted to do this.Overall, we had a great time here and would definitely return!

<Content>Wonderful stay! We just got back from 4 nights at the Hilton Hawaiin Village and had a wonderful time. Location is great - at end of Waikiki with great beach access and walking distance to variety of shops and dining options. Stayed at the Alii towers which is worth the extra money (we explored all the pools and it was nice to come back to ours for a spa and free appetizers in the late afternoon). Started our stay with firework show as the kids played in the surf (great way to start a trip if it falls on a Friday evening). Recommend renting a car to explore the island and drive up the coast. If your a Lost fan, you will find many spots that you will remember from the show. Pearl Harbor is worth a day trip which should include a trip to the Missouri and Bowfinger sub. Recommendation for a nice dinner would be Ocean View (about 2 hotels away in the Outrigger), also Todai is a fun sushi and seafood frenzy in all you can eat style (highlight of my 11 yr. olds trip). We found staff to be very helpful and genuine from the Bellman's initial greeting of Welcome Home! to the valet's closing remark of Mahalo, have a safe flight and hope to see you again.

<Content>oasis in the city yes waikiki is busy and crowded , sometimes like chicago during rush hour, but we find that the hilton hawaiian village is like an oasis in the middle of all the hustle and bustle , no matter how much you've heard about waikiki its rare blend of sensual ambiance and sophisticated packaging must be experienced to be understood . there's really nothing about waikiki that isn't unique , but there are places that will remain glued to your memory cells like snapshots of your trip to the islands , and the hilton hawaiian village is one of those places with its torch lit path ways and soft night breezes .

<Content>Fab Hotel We absolutely loved this resort. the only downside was some of the staff who were most unpleasant, especially when we wanted to cash travellers cheques. We had a room in the Ali'i Tower which had its own check in desk, swimming pool and complimentary evening hors d'oeuvres in the Ocean View Terrace Bar. The room itself was very nice with beautiful decor.There were a large number of restaurants in the hotel with a price range to suit all. It was as you can expect much more expensive than the bars and restaurants which were outside the resort, however, it is the price you pay when you stay in this type of resort right on Waikiki Beach.

<Content>Loved This Place This was the best out of the three hotels we stayed at during our honeymoon to Hawaii. The location was perfect, we were able to walk into town at night, staff was extremely accomodating, they even upgraded us several levels, champagne was in our room upon arrival and bottled water every day. Only downfall the cost of food, we ate outside of the resort as much as possible, which was easy due to the location. All you can eat pancakes $5.95 across the street. We stayed in the Alli Tower, which has it's own pool, gym, hot tub and bar area, free appetizers were served every night from 5-7pm, three hot trays, fruit and cheese. The bartender ROCKY, very good, we drank his suggested drink the ITCH. The birds, fish, penguins and foilage was just breath taking. Our room was comfortable, clean and big with a nice patio. The beach and water were clean. The shops inside the resort were very nice alittle pricey, but you are on vacation and inside a resort. We went to a nice bar/restaurant called DUKES in town within walking distance if your not afraid of walking, inexpensive and a great atmosphere. We felt very comfortable in this hotel and in the area (maybe it has to do with the fact that I grew up so close to NYC).

<Content>Dissappointed in Service Level Our family of 4 just returned from an eight day vacation to Oahu, staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The Hilton is rather pricey , but the description of the property made me think it was going to be worth the extra dollars we would be spending on this beachfront hotel. My husband and I found the the service unreliable (even after repeated, daily requests to stock the room with towels and supplies for 4 people, they just never got it...! And little annoyances like our room key never working in the parking garage, etc.) and for the most part, unfriendly. Maybe it's because the Hilton is such a huge resort and friendly/caring just isn't part of the deal. Also, I agree with some of the other reviews of Waikiki hotels about the nickel and diming that goes on. The Hilton Village does its fair share of this practice, and it's almost a joke. Also, our oceanfront view room was partial oceanfront at best. And we woke to the sound of tour busses and trucks every morning - - all morning...We loved Oahu, but next time we will definitely stay someplace else!

<Content>Everything at your fingertips We stayed in the lagoon towers and had a 2 bedroom condo. It was great. The resort offers several restaurants from sushi to pizza. The shopping was all right there and had the same stores that were further down in Waikiki. The beach was easy to find a spot. The pool was nice but closed very early, (5:30 pm). The drawback is you are quite a ways from the main part of Waikiki and have to take a bus or taxi to that part. Plus, buses stop operating at 9 pm.

<Content>Ask for the Kalia Tower We stayed here for 2 nights. The first night in the Tapa Tower...bad choice! Although we were on the 10th floor, the band playing at the Tapa Bar until 11pm was loud enough in our room to keep us awake when sleep was needed! We asked to be moved and were relocated to the Kalia Tower despite full hotel. The tower was beautiful - quiet, elegant, dedicated concierge and valet parking. In addition, a small private pool on the 4th floor for residents of the tower - nice! The grounds are pretty, although the Super Pool small for the size of the resort. Beach chairs were packed in and tight. You needed to come down at 8a to get a good seat! The village had lots of nice convenient shopping. Restaurant choices were diverse although pricey, and challenging for younger kids.

<Content>Honeymoon Surprises My husband booked us a trip to Hawaii for our honeymoon. We were so excited. When we got there, the wait was horrific. They sent us to a room with a view of a parking lot on a rooftop which was not what my husband paid for. He's stayed at this hotel before and he always got a room with an ocean view. He was irritated even more to see that something very important was also left out. My husband wanted to surprise me with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries when we got to the hotel so he requested that ahead of time when he made reservations. They said that everything was going to be perfect for our honeymoon stay. Not only did they put us in the wrong room (smelling of smoke) we requested a non-smoking one, but we had to lug all of our belonging to another building- the Rainbow Hilton (that was the building we requested from the start), they didn't even have my surprise in the room. I felt so bad for my husband b/c he rarely surprises me with such romantic jestures and he wanted our honeymoon to be a perfect start to our life together. By the time he got off the phone with the front desk about the problem, I heard about it and it totally ruined the surprise. I didn't even want the champagne and strawberries anymore, but they insisted on rectifying their mistake by bringing them up but still charged us. Too many wrongs for my liking. My Honeymoon surprises were not so good b/c the hotel staff made too many mistakes and ruined them, but the stay was alright.

<Content>beautiful stay at the HHV We stayed here for our honeymoon on our first few days in Hawaii. We were upgraded to an ocean view at no extra charge. The hotel is a short walk to the beach and there are lots of stores and restaurants in the hotel itself. The grounds are beautiful and have many species of birds walking the grounds at any given time. In the lobby area, free tropical juice is given to you while you wait in line to check in. The room was spacious and very clean. We had a wonderful stay at the HHV and would love to return someday.

<Content>Overpriced This hotel is a city in a city. It can be very overwhelming. We stayed in the Alii Tower. This is Hilton's version of Club level. Not worth it! You had to pay for continental breakfast and very expensive drinks. No perks here for the extra price. The pools are crowded and the beach is actually a public beach. The shops and restaurants on site are very expensive. Not recommended for families.

<Content>Consistent, Outstanding Quality We have stayed at this property every year for over 35 years, and it has never failed us. Management of this large hotel complex is top notch, and the hotel is constantly renovating and upgrading its rooms. We had originally booked a stay at the Royal Hawaiian (see my other review) for a change of pace, but came running back to the Hilton after only one night at the Pink Palace....We are Hilton Diamond members (top level) and they took good care of us by upgrading us to a newly renovated suite (par for the course at this hotel). The room was spotless, the hotel staff friendly and helpful and the grounds well maintained.Also, the Hilton makes the BEST mai tais in the islands. Go to the Hau Tree bar and tell them the Jacksons sent you. Aloha!

<Content>Great for the Family The Village was very clean and had nice grounds. We stayed in the Ali'i Tower w/ a partial ocean view. The room was large but the view was of the park and construction machinery in the distance was the ocean. We wereupgraded to this tower so we did not complain. Most of the food was moderately priced. DO NOT have breakfast here. $60 for eggs and bacon. I agree with others that the VIllage is confused. Is it upscale or affordable? It is not upscale even though it had a Louis Vitton. The room was affordable but I would NOT pay more than $250/ night or you will be sorely disappointed and feel ripped off. My husband and I (no children) were disappointed in the resort nightlife. We went to the military bar across the way. Great times! The rest of our group had a wonderful time! The 13 of us went to the Polynesian Luau, DO IT. Hike Diamond Head, go to the Bay, get out of Honolulu!!! Overall I would stay here if I got a good rate (we're HH members), but I would stay on another island if I had the choice.

<Content>Fabolous place This property has it all, it is simply a village. It has lots of tower blocks and we stayed in the Tapa Tower which is very central when you go downstairs. They have loads of restaurants, shops, mini market ABC store, they are all over Honolulu. It is directly on the beach and well worth it. You can rent beds etc on the beach. It is about a ten minute walk to the centre of Waikiki, you can walk along the beach at night but a taxi is only 7USD if you are feeling lazy. I originally had booked a cheaper hotel in Honolulu and was so glad I changed. If ever I was to go back, I would definetly stay there.

<Content>save your $$$ the positives: friendly and helpful staff, the room was pretty clean and the location is good. here are the buts: the construction noise is still noticeable from the farthest building (diamond head tower). the walls were also pretty thin (we could hear everytime someone flushed their toilet). they charge extra for everything (parking, internet, gym)--we learned that other hotels in the area do not charge extra for these things. parking: 20/day, internet 65/day.the gym was horrible (old 80s equipment, kids running around, and they charged 17 per day for this (paradise pass: internet and gym)) check out the gym before you sign up, because once you sign up, you will be charged for everyday of your stay. you can't decide to cancel the paradise pass...if you do stay here or in the area, park for free nearby off hobron (kai'oo st.) or on ala wai blvd. watch the signs for street sweeping and such, but for the most part, there's cheap parking around, you just have to take the 15 min. or so to find it. Hilton charges you 20 bucks from 1pm-1pm (daily) which gets to be really expensive if you're staying a while. you can also leave your car on the top floors of ala moana shopping center which is about a 10-15 minute walk away. we did a combo of these things while we were there.also we took a surf lesson with hilton's surf schools and it was pretty lame for what we got. maybe better for kids, not so much for adults. the instructors don't teach you anything but how to stand up on the board (a 12 foot softtop that is a lot easier to ride than normal boards). basically, you get babied. students get towed in (most don't even paddle themselves out to the break), and they take turns waiting to get pushed into waves--if all you're looking for is the sensation of surfing, this might be the way to go. but if you really want to learn to surf, this is a waste of money. i would recommend learning somewhere on the north shore instead. if you want to go out on your own, they will also rent boards for a lot cheaper up there too (7/hour as opposed to 35/2 hours which is what hilton charges). i've never personally taken a lesson on the north shore, but i wish i had. my friends on the island suggested it but i was lazy and wanted to stay in town. anything has to be better, at the very least, equal to this surf school for what they charge.to be fair, i would say hilton hawaiian village is probably great for the average tourist who expects a very touristy and kitschy experience of the island. from someone who has briefly lived here before, my advice would be to stay somewhere smaller, more low key. travel around the island--there are so many great spots off the beaten path. the touristy spots overcharge and you don't get a real feel for the community or the island itself. pick up the honolulu weekly and see what events are coming up--don't limit yourself to generic luaus, crowded pools and beaches, hotel shopping and other tourists as company---get out there and try to get to know the island and its people. the easiest way to do that is by doing some research before and during your stay.best of luck :) hope this advice is useful.

<Content>Up to its promises After almost 2 months of reading the reviews and comparing hotels, I decided to go ahead and book the $279 ocean view from the Hilton Waikiki Village.I called the day before to ask which Tower we were assigned. They said Tapa or Diamond Head. I knew it would not be the nicest towers (did not pay premium for Rainbow, Kali etc..) but decided to go with it.I arrived after 1am due to flight and luggage delays and still got an awasome service at check-in. The room was in Diamond Head tower. I read in the reviews it is supposed to be the least desirable, but let me tell you it was great. We could see the ocean, the beach, the city , Diamond Head all at the same time from our private lanai.We loved everything in the hotel: service, food, beach, bars, stores...you feel like you do not want to leave it.There is a free trolley to waikiki at Tapa tower by the way if you want to explore.It did not feel crowded even though there was plenty of people due to July 4th.The spa was very good very professional.I had a AMAZING hot stone lomi lomi massage from Cornelius.Kudos to the Hilton. Yes it is pricey but there are a lot of cheap places in waikiki in super crowded hotels with street view and that's not why you came to Hawaii.

<Content>Wonderful Family Vacation We left Tennessee June 9th, for a weeks stay, in hopes of having a wonderful vacation. There were a total of 13 family members, and I can say for a fact not one of us had any problems. I had ordered Lei's form leigreeting.com, and Sheena met us at the airport and showed us to the baggage claim. Our trip started out great with a Limo pickup at the airport by Platinum Limousine Service. You can imagine the surprise when it arrived, especially when I had told them we would be taking a shuttle to the hotel. Mark was our driver, and with 13 of us, he loaded up alot of luggage, but not as much as Chris did when he was the driver of our Ford Excursion Limo back to the airport. Some of us had purchased more luggage to take souveniers back home to members of our family who could not make the trip. For some of us, this was our first Limo Ride. We had family members in the Kalia Tower, Ali Tower and Rainbow Tower. I was originally in the Kalia, but since we were in Hawaii wanted to be on the ocean. Daniel at the front desk was a jewel in finding my husband and I the perfect room. We stayed in room #1201, two balconies, the ocean and the view of Diamond Head, what more could you ask for. It was the perfect place to be with all the family eating pizza from The Round Table and watching the fireworks display on Friday night. My sister Louneil and I really enjoyed the beach. We were there almost every day relaxing under our umbrella and watching the waves go in and out. It was so peaceful. I had read about passing it on where floats were given by people who were leaving to go home, to others on the beach, well we experienced that. My nieces, Cyara and Hailey were given huge blue floats that we passed on to others the day we were leaving. On Sunday night we all went to the Paradise Cove Luau, and had a wonderful time with LeiLana (I hope this is correct) on bus #5, she was great. We ate at Benihana's which was wonderful, and as stated before not that expensive. A favorite place was Surfs Up, really enjoyed the Pink Coral Drink.The resort takes on a different atmosphere at night, with the wind blowing off the ocean, and light from the TIKI torches. At different locations throughout the resort you can stop anytime and listen to the singers. We shopped at the International Market Place. Some family members went to Kauai, and the Big Island. Some hiked to Diamond Head and others stayed on Waikiki. If you didn't want to venture out, you didn't have to, everything you need is within walking distance of the resort. My husband and I are already talking about going back, and staying in the Rainbow Tower, and if we could the same room. I can't stop saying what a wonderful time our family had staying at HHV. We were all together, but then we were not. I guess that was the best part. Mahalo......Vanessa

<Author>GETAWAYPLEASE
<Content>Charged for everything  This was definitely an expensive resort to book. We have stayed at many five star resorts in the past, on Maui, in Mexico, on Kauai. This was the most expensive to book a room in the beginning. But when we arrived, everything seemed to cost. We booked a garden view but when we arrived they put us in a tower very far from the ocean. Oh well. But then they said we could have an ocean view room (it was hart to see the ocean) for $40 more per night in a much closer walk to the beach. We agreed. After that the expenses just kept coming. $25 per day to park the car, $14 for internet service, coffee charges, a sandwich from room service at $23, buffet for $34 per person, The Tropics (cheapest hotel restaraunt) very expensive and TERRIBLE food. All these things make you feel less like you are at a resort and more uncomfortable each day. The coffee, car and internet should be included as with many places we've stayed and if you charge so much for food and drink make it GOOD. We went next door to eat and drink at the military hotel at half the price. The food was still not much better, but it was half the price! We ate at Dukes (the best salad bar ever) and Bennihanas paid the price but had excellent food and dining experience.The diamond head hike was not easy as most hiking books say. I may be out of shape but my kids and husband aren't at all and were still exhausted. The view was not quite worth the crowd and exhaustion becuase usually after a hike you have a great water fall to see or a place to sit and relax to look at a view or play on a beach. Too crowded to even have a place to rest. We LOVE Maui and Kauai. Oahu was too busy, too difficult to get around with unmarked roads etc, and not half as friendly. Everything you do is crowded and touristy.We will never go back unless we island hopped for one day to visit Pearl Harbor again.

<Content>HHV I enjoyed my time on the island , but it was busy with people .HHV was also busy , You could say I was overwhelmed . Never realized how many people on this island. It's pretty and all ..... My room was nice and clean . I read more bad reviews on this site then positive .There needs to be more positive reviews for the people who's visiting this island . I know one thing it was hard for me to deciede to plan , I been on many vacations but Oahu was the hardest . Hawaii islands are expensive just have to overbudget .

<Content>HHV is your best option when staying in Waikiki I selected the Hilton Hawaiian Village based upon the reviews of the trip advisor website. We stayed for one week, June 6-13. I booked a partial ocean room in the Alli Tower based upon my research and was not upset with our choice. Please note that if you are afraid of heights you should not book an ocean view, or partial ocean view, these rooms are up higher and my husband refused to sit on the patio. Save yourself the money and book a garden view. The hotel and grounds itself, I believe, are the nicest in Waikiki. However, we were unprepared for what Waikiki was and we went there after staying in Maui. We much prefer Maui, to Waikiki. However, if you do go, I believe that the HHV is definitely the place to stay. According to our 9 year old, the best thing about the Alli tower were the penguins. On most days, an employee will teach you about the penguins (1-2 times a day) and have a few penguins out for the people to pet. Every day we had to visit them at least 2 times!I read a number of reviews that talked about how expensive it was, and after being in Maui, I found that Waikiki was actually far less expensive. We ate at the hotel several times for lunch and dinner, and were not totally shocked by the price, although it was not 鈥渁mazing food.鈥?During the morning I walked to Starbucks for coffee and to be more comfortable, we usually ended up eating breakfast in the room. We shopped at the ABC stores (interesting but the ABC store near starbucks was cheaper than the one on the hotel grounds.) We bought fruit, cereal, milk, and drinks. We also ate at a coffee shop across the street from the hotel for breakfast-very cheap and great food! There are tons of restaurants in walking distance. We went to Roys, (if you go, save money and order the appetizer portion, not the meal portion as it is very large!) Benehania, the Yard House, and a few others. There is a subway sandwich shop down the beach that we often picked up lunch at. The HHV definitely has the best beach. The water was calm, and not very crowded. The pool, was better then any of the other hotels, and the property was beautiful. When we walked down Waikiki we could not believe how crazy and crowded it was. We drove to North Shore to go jet skiing. We also ate at a shrimp taco truck called Giovanni鈥檚, which is not to be missed, and had shaved ice in the afternoon. I think that if you don鈥檛 go to North Shore, you miss some of the most beautiful beaches on the island. We went to turtle beach and saw, and swam near, tons of turtles.Overall, I don鈥檛 ever think we will return to Waikiki, but if we did, we would only stay at the HHV.

<Content>Best Hotel for mixture of seclusion yet Of all the hotels in Waikiki, this one has the most accomodations, amenities, and attractions in close proximity. The highways in/out of Waikiki to get to Pearl Harbor, Diamond Head, Nu-uanu Pali Lookout, etc. are all close by. The beach was clean, the pools were well kept, and the breakfast buffet was perfect. Although Waikiki is really commercialized, you still feel relatively secluded from the busy strip, but yet you can get to all the hot spots, like Dukes, Shorebird restauarant, etc. I would also highly recommend taking a sunset boat trip, on any of those offered along the beach. We went on the MaiTai, which we could pick up in front of the Sheraton or Shorebird hotel, and it was fun and scenic.

<Content>Wonderful stay! Beautiful property. We recently stayed here for 4 nights. Booked a room in the Ali'i Tower. This is the place to stay. Has is own rooftop pool and you can still use the lagoon pool. Building is right on the beach. What we loved about this location is the wide beach and not as crowded as the other parts of Waikiki. Lots of great shopping options. Food was expensive, but at breakfast- portions were so large we split them and still had plenty. Rooms were quiet and large and tastefully decorated. Ali'i Tower has complimentary appetizers each afternoon which is good for holding you out for a late dinner- when restaurants are not as crowded. This was a great place to stay.

<Content>Still Great abd Getting Better The Hilton Hawaiian Village is still a great place to stay. The aloha spirit is included with each employee greeting. The hotel is very well maintained and is on a great section of Waikiki beach. The location is pretty good, withiin walking distance of a lot of restaurants, including Hard Rock and Cheeseburger in Paradise. If you can stay Friday, they have a mini-luau (no food) with 2 drinks at $12. This is a great deal. The fireworks are really good. A tip on transportation - Use Roberts for only $30 round trip. Just look for th eyellow vested employees at baggage claim. They are extremely efficient and the Hilton is one of the first stops dropping off and one of the last picking up.The hotel is getting better. With the addition of the new time share buildings going up, they are building huge swimming pools. These are supposed to be completed in 2007. It will be the best swimming pools in Waikiki.

<Content>Consistent, great hotel! We have stayed at the HHV before. Nothing has changed. We never had any problems with our 5-day stay. From the bellmen to housekeeping to all of the staff - absolutely perfect. The beach is large and beautiful. We were in the Alii tower which is definitely worth every penny. Say hello to Mei Ling. She works during the continental breakfast on the 2d floor. She's worked for the hotel over 18 years. Only complaint, if we had one, would be the pools - just wish there was some kind of water feature like a slide or something. Other than that, this hotel is perfect. We are well-traveled and discriminating. The hotel is a cab ride away from all of the Honolulu action (or a long walk in the humidity). There is a lot of shopping and great food choices in the Village. Sergio's Italian is wonderful. I would not hesitate in staying here again, but am very spoiled in the Alii tower. Thank you Hilton again for a great stay.

<Content>Loved the HHV!!! What a fabulous hotel. I'm a major traveler, having been to all 50 states, Hawaii - several times, as well as Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. This property was awesome. Be sure to ask for a corner room in the Tapa Tower -- they are huge, somewhat like a suite. If I had to complain about anything it would be the cost of food and drinks - but hey, you are in Hawaii after all and you could walk anywhere you want to look for better prices.I've stayed at several other hotels in Hawaii -- Honolulu specifically -- and in the future the Hilton Hawaiian will always be my first choice.

<Author>krlaWesthartford_CT
<Content>In Honolulu for a Convention A disclaimer first...I do not like staying at large resorts in big cities, and Hilton Hawaiian Village is by any definition a large resort and Honolulu is a big city. Having said that, the (sprawling) grounds were well kept, the staff very friendly and service oriented, the room I had was good (not great by any stretch), and the available activities were numerous. It is located directly on Waikiki Beach. It is truly a village in that if you do not want to leave the grounds, you do not need to. VERY expensive for drink/food...at breakfast, a regular size capuccino and a 12 oz. bottle of water at one of the walk-up bars near the tower I was staying in was over $9.00. I believe that a large pepperoni pizza at the Round Table Pizza outlet on the grounds was approx. $30.Somebody else recommeded going to the ABC store on the grounds...great suggestion. Sandwiches/chips/beer/wine/soft drinks at a reasonable price...sundires also available.The positives (I was attending a convention) was that it was centrally located and near the Convention Center, had many amenities, and the service was especially customer friendly. The downside is it's sheer size (and far too many stores to shop in on the grounds), prices, and the fact that is highly trafficked (to be expected, I guess, since it is in Honolulu).

<Content>Ok, but not great My new husband and I stayed at Hilton Hawaiian Village for our honeymoon the first week of June. We payed extra for the deluxe ocean view room and we were a little disappointed with what we got. We did see the ocean, but we were also over the construction site for the new lagoon, so we got to see and hear that. We asked upon check-in if we could move to the other side of the tower, but we were told nothing was available. Not a huge deal, we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. The room itself was decent. Clean, the bed was comfortable and there was a small fridge and coffee maker (although the maids weren't very good at remembering to leave new cups after taking the old). It just didn't feel worth the money it cost, kind of like a glorified Motel 6 room (which I guess is typical for Oahu). The grounds are nice and there are a lot of dining options at the resort, although they are all pretty pricey. You can definitely eat cheaper elsewhere on the island. We thought the little beach in front was great until we visited the north side of the island (beaches are much nicer over there). Overall it was a pretty good experience, but there was one thing that really bothered the two of us: the staff is constantly trying to get you to their seminars to buy one of their time shares. They slipped a card under our door inviting us about two seconds after we entered our room, we tried to book a massage at the spa and the receptionist tried to sign us up for the seminar, we walked past an information booth and the man inside tried to rope us in and tell us about the exciting opportunity, they even called our room and left us a message not to miss the time share opportunity!! It was a little ridiculous, it got to be a running joke between me and my husband.The hotel wasn't bad, but we definitely won't be staying there again. There are cheaper places to stay on the island where you don't feel bombarded by salespeople.Hope this helps!

<Content>Good if you have kids This hotel is good if your traveling with kids. The place is like a zoo. Great pool, just loud when entering the lobby, and it's a bit confusing. I went up with some friends, and it's ideal if you have children, but not for a romantic getaway.

<Content>Ahh... Relaxation and comfort We had the pleasure of staying at this resort in early May. Very beautiful, and well taken care of. The staff were pleasant, and welcoming. The restaurants were great, yet you will pay for the comfort. We had lunch at the Rainbow Lanai and it was over $50 for the two of us, no dessert, and one drink. There is plenty of shops to visit and look at, and even one of the thousands ABC stores on the island. The beach area was beautiful and relaxing. The noise of other areas of Waikiki was gone... just the sound of waves and walkable beaches (no rocky shorelines). A little recommendation... save yourself the headache, and once you get into your room, immediately throw away any card, flyer, note, brochure that refers to free items or scratch-off prizes. Unless, you like to sit and listen to timeshare presentations all day and like to say no alot. I did so, and glad I did (after seeing the faces of many friends who were curious).Also, spend the extra money and take some type of formal transporation. The hotel has arrangements with taxi companies, including Charlie's which for $12.00, took us to the airport in a limo. I took the city bus one day to go see Pearl Harbor, and lets just say, Tyenol and a comfy bed was my friend the rest of the day.Great place, great atmosphere, beautiful views, and several photo opportunities. Even if your not staying there, walk down one night and get some photos.

<Content>Breathtaking Hilton! We stayed at the Hilton for six nights. Check-in was great. We were upgraded from a garden view to a partial ocean view upon request. The woman who checked us in (Jackie) told me that was all she had available, but if I wanted to check with her the next day would move us. We decided to stay where we were as the room was quite large and still had a great view. We were in the Tapa Tower. The property and grounds were well maintained with over 90 stores and 22 restaurants. We only ate on site one day as the prices are a bit steep. It is a short walk to other restaurants, Eggs  Things, Tony Roma's  Cheeseburger Waikiki. The beach was beautiful and towels were complimentary. Rental of chairs and an umbrella was about $51. I also used the Spa as a gift from my husband. It was more than I would have paid at home, but it was worth it. The only thing my husband was a bit disappointed in was the price of a bottle of wine and a fruit tray delivered on the evening of our anniversary. He requested that it be set up with linen and to look fancy. It was placed on the desk without a nice presentation for the $120 cost. Other than that, we had absolutely no complaints. We would definitly stay here again. Enjoy your trip!

<Content>Beautiful place to stay! My husband and I stayed at the HHV on Waikiki the first week in April for our 5th wedding anniversary. The entire staff was extremely accommodating. I was 7 months pregnant, and I am sure my big belly helped to upgrade to a nicer room. They originally put us up in the Kalia with a partial ocean view. -But it also included a noisy city street and view of a garbage dump. They promptly moved us to nearly the top floor of the Tapa tower with a gorgeous view of Diamond head, and a much bigger room.This is a BIG resort. So of course, if you plan on staying here, there are going to be lots of people. Although I did not feel like there were huge crowds at all. If they were completely booked, it did not feel that way. The pools stayed busy, but we were on the Beach most of the time. (Who goes to Hawaii only to swim in a pool?). The hotel has a private stretch of Beach, and its nice, but if you just walk 1/2 a block or so up the Beach towards Diamond head, the Beach and water is much more spacious and alot nicer. Also do not rent your lounge chairs from the resort. -Just up the walk are private Beach rentals for ALOT cheaper. There's also a great food stand in the same area that has some great eats!!The grounds at the Hotel are AMAZING! I was very much impressed with the cleanliness and the beautiful landscaping. Although the resort is right in the heart of downtown Honlulu, it is still very much secluded. I dont know how others can complain about the grounds. - I dont think you could make a resort any more beautiful.My only complaint about this resort is the OUTRAGOUS prices at the resturants, spas, boutiques, etc. ! I know Hawaii is not cheap, but you are already paying a pretty penny for your room, and they will choke you from every other angle if you are not careful. We ate breakfast once at the Resort and spent $60 on a basic buffet. After that we had milk and cereal in our rooms every morning. And as I previously mentioned, we ate at the little beach side food stands just up the Beach about a block for lunches. We visited the ABC store frequently for snacks and small stuff, they have everything there -It's the only store on the resort to shop for items like this anyway. And it is always BUSY!Do not buy your souveniors at any of the shops there either!!! Just up the street a few blocks is a Wal-mart with the BEST souvenior gifts. (We took the bus which runs often and is very clean and reliable). And its all the same stuff you find at the Hotel gift shops and boutiques at a fraction of the price. The macadamia chocolates for example are about $13 for 6 boxes and you can mabye get two boxes for that price at the Hotel! We also went to the swap meet at Aloha Stadium. -VERY MUCH WORTH THE TIME AND TRAVEL! This place was amazing! If you are looking to buy authentic Hawaiin gifts, this is the place!Also, do not book any of your tours through the Hotel, they will rip you off like you would not believe! There are free travel and vacation guides all over the place, and I think there is one main stand in the Tapa tower, with tons of great deals and coupons on private companies. All of these places pick you up right from the Hotel. We took a great all day tour of the island including the North Shore and about 20 major beaches and sites for $25 p.p., whereas the Hotel was charging $75 for the same tour!! Even private shuttles to the airport where half the price.Overall, the HHV was a gorgeous place to stay, and if your smart you will save tons of money!!

<Content>Fun in the Sun My husband and I stayed at the Hiton in May for a week. We're used to Sandals all-inclusives and this was our first non-inclusive trip, so with that said, here's a summary:Resot - Huge! Pretty well kept with lots of ponds through out (penguins, flamingos, coi). Pool was rather small and seemed pretty crowded, but the beach was spectacular and not crowded at all, especially when you saw the rest of Waikiki Beach. Fantastic fireworks show on Friday we saw from our lanai. People at the front desk were polite, but not overly friendly. The best rates were offered through the Hilton web site with AAA discounts. Lodging - we decided to splurge on a Rainbow Tower oceanfront room. Fantastic! Great views of the beach, Waikiki, Diamond Head. Nice that there's a fridge and little wet bar. Stocked up at ABC on wine, beer, water, snacks. Wonderful lanai. We were only on the 6th floor but it was high enough to enjoy the view and felt secure enough to leave the lanai door open a few nights. AC didn't work very well though. I'm a coffee snob, so I had brought my own which we couldn't use in the coffee maker since it just uses pods. Housekeeping didn't show up everyday, but we were too busy having fun to care and when she did show up she left a bunch of Crabtree toiletries.Restaurants - very expensive at the resort for the most part. We were on a budget since we splurged on the room. For breakfast we went to the Wailana Coffee House (open 24 hours) across from the Hilton for big portions and good service. We also discovered CJ's on the property which was only a little more. Great omelettes. For lunch and dinner we tried Round Table Pizza which has very reasonable and yummy pizzas and sandwiches(take out as well). If you like Japanese, there's a noodle place and sushi place side by side on the resort. Sergios is their Italian restaurant and was good but not amazing. We had drinks at the Chart House (off-property) but it was pricey and not very friendly. We loved Duke's at the Outrigger! Try their fish tacos and drinks are around $6 instead of the $10 at Tropics and Hua Tree (both at the Hilton). We also went to Hale Koa for cheap and good drinks and pub fare. There's also a Subway right on the beach. ABC store had great muffins, sandwiches, snacks, souvenirs, everything! We spent over $200 there and got 2 mugs for saving our receipts.Beach - my husband took surf lessons with Rich at PTS half way down the beach and loved it. Much less than at the Hilton. There's a great beach walk that runs along Waikiki and we saw fantastic surfing and body boarding. Beautiful sunsets. All beaches are public, so we'd just drive along and stop when we saw a public way to end up on very beautiful, isolated beaches. Much nicer than Waikiki. Especially liked Sunset Beach and snorkeled at Three Tables. Also tried snorkeling at Hanauma Bay, but it was low tide and only about 2 feet btwn you and the coral. Getting Around - Rent a car! We were planning on taking the Bus, but decided to book through Priceline before we left and had a sedan for 2 days. Priceline had the best prices (we chose Dollar since it was the cheapest and close to the hotel). Definitely book ahead of time - Dollar at the Hilton was sold out before we got there. Explored the North Shore and East Oahu. Also, if you head out to the North Shore, stop at Giovanni's shrimp truck for $12 plates of half pounds of shrimp with rice - amazing! Fantastic views all along the coastal route. There are also trolleys, which we didn't try. For transportation to and from the airport we used the Waikiki Express (Roberts Hawaii). it was $9 per person each way which was a bargain compared with the $26 pp the Hilton was charging. When you get to the airport, just look for the people in yellow shirts outside baggage claim. We waited about 20 minutes and were lucky enough to be the first stop - they hit all the hotels along Waikiki.Pearl Harbor - we went on the 7:30 shuttle from the Hilton and went to the Arizona, Bowfin, Minnesota and Pacific Aviation Museum. Almost no line that early in the morning. Definitely worth it.Asides - if you're going to snorkel again, buy your stuff at the ABC stores or bring it from home. It was great to just throw it in the car and hit a beach. Also, bought towels at ABC, but you could probably just grab them from the pool. I brought a cooler tote bag which was great to fill up with snacks and drinks. Water shoes are a good idea since the beaches can have chunks of coral. Also, I got an inflatable (again the ABC) to use which was a nice way to relax in the water (and use snorkeling). The sun is extremely strong, so I suggest wearing a hat and loading up on sun screen.Before you go - I did a lot of research and found Oahu Revealed to be the best source of info. Also got the Hawaiin Entertainment Book ($18) which we didn't use a lot, but it did save us about $40 at Pearl Harbor for the Minnesota and Bowfin tours.Overall it was a great vacation, but if I was to do it again I'd pick a less expensive hotel since we didn't really use the pool, shop in the stores or eat at many restaurants and rent a car for three or more days since there are such gorgeous places to see all over Oahu. For us the best part was the beach, snorkeling and exploring.

<Author>BreaGymMom
<Content>WoW! Everything and MORE! I really investagated all of these hotels. I must say i really did my homework!! First off ,i picked this hotel for many reasons one being , that I did not want to be in the middle of waikiki. It's too hard to get out of there in a car, and i was planning on driving around the island alot. It;s closest to the airport, and freeway and mostly away from downtown traffic and thier one way streets!! ugg!.It's still close enough to walk down to the middle of the strip of waikik if you want some action or get a bite to eat. Secondly..This hotel offers the nicest,(probably the only) tropical grounds offered in all of waikiki. A lot of hotels even the popular ones don't have grounds and are butt up against the street. This was my familes 1st time,(not mine) to hawaii and i wanted them to get the whole aloha spirit.Okay some of you have to understand that if you pick this hotel it IS going to be expensive. I read reviews of people complaining and bickering about the charges and prices of this hotel,well...don't stay here. You go knowing what to expect and you work around it.It is a fancy ,expensive RESORT. The food was expensive!! Just don't eat there.No big deal. This hotel offers so much more then to be passed on cause of food. ALL hotel food places are expensive!!! You can't get away from it. There is a coffe shop across the street called Waiana Coffee House 1860 Ala Moana Blv. (808)955-1764.It offered reaonable prices,and the food was good.IT was a nice short 4 min walk there. The hotel does have a lot to offer. I brought a family of 5 along. (13,5,18 mos,2 adults.) The hotel offers many fun FREE activities. They offer fish feeding 2 times a day every day. The kids LOVED it! They have penguins on the property,you get to feed them and learn some facts about them. The care takers of these animals,really love thier jobs and teaching , and interacting with the guests. They have tucans and turtels,flamingos,koi fish. We also took a hula class and a lei making class. That was fun. Again all free. We stayed in the ali'i tower highly recomended! You get a door man who, of course opens your door and if your lucky he'll greet you by you last name. Hello,Mr  Mrs Wiemann,how are you today?)You get free water,cofee and tea. to your likeing.They turn down your bed everynight of you stay. They put chocolate and flowers on your bed. You get FANCY shampoo and conditoners. Eveyln and crabtree!!!!!Worth the extra cost to stay here. You get to check in and have your own concierge. It IS ON the opposite side of the busy building they are doing next to the rainbow tower. I didn't hear a thing!!! The parking for the car is EXPENSIVE!!! No LIE! It was bad.Checked around they all cost about the same. 20-25 dollers a DAY! Well, save for it that's what we did. We had a car everyday. 200 smackers for 10 days!! The hotel itself was worth it. We had a 50 dollar dining credit,which we used torward a breakfast buffet in the rainbow lani. (Its another tower on the property grounds. there are5 all together i think. )The food there was Terrific! Ate next to a pond and a waterfall. Life couldn't be better.In the ali'i tower ,They had a private pool for the ali'i guests. free apetizers were served at the pool bar from 4-7pm.That was dinner for us. The hotel offered a friday Night firework show with hula dancers. We got to watch it from are hotel lani. Don't buy the tickets. We were in room 1125 that was facing the pool and the fancy tropical grounds. We saw everything from there.Ask for that side.By the way,..we didn't feel,nickeled and dimedi quess cause we payed extra for the nicest tower there. It was worth it! The hotel staff were soo nice!The hotel also offered a kids club!Bye, kids have fun!!! The snorkeling in front of the hotel was fun. if you swim out a little bit there is a long jetty filled with fish.Please write me if you have any questions. i promise i'll help you. This was truley the best experince we ever has and WAS worth EVERY penny!! Except the parking,but that could not be avoided.In all the grounds were very tropical and had several waterfalls throughout thte property. Call the hotel and have them mail out all the pamphelts they have to offer on the hotel grounds and the activites they offer. that way you can get an idea whats there.That's what i did. it came in about a week. Made more sence when you know what your dealing with and how much money you need to save. they offer activies too. parasailing,etc ask for those pamphlets too. good luck, hope i was able to help.Have fun staying there.

<Content>Construction Ruined Atmosphere We just returned from our visit to the Hilton Hawaiian Village Lagoon Tower. Our room was very large and comfortable, but unfortunately we were overwhelmed with all of the construction noise going on all around us from 6:30 am to 6 pm Monday thru Saturday. When we complained to the front desk one nice man moved us up 2 floors but said that was the best he could do since they were sold out and had several floors closed for refurbishment.No where on the website does it inform you that the Lagoon Pool is closed and that the construction is as an inconvienence as it is. We had to walk down the middle of the driveway to get to the pool at the rainbow tower because they were working on the sidewalks. Also the super pool closed very early. The beach was nice but was littered with cigarette butts and trash. Also the elevators were so crowded on the check out day we had to go up to just be able to get into an elevator that would fit our luggage. The cleaning staff, bell staff and other hotel workers also were squeezing into the same crowded elevators.The drink prices are quite outrageous at 9.75 each, as well as the self parking rate of $20 a day. Over all the experience was nice just being away and being with family but it definitely did not live up to the Hilton experience. The property in Waikola is sooooo much nicer !I definitely won't be returning here.

<Content>Fantastiv view Stayed at the Hilton HV at the end of March. Had an ocean front room at the Rainbow Tower overlooking the beach and Diamond Head, and the view was just fantastic. Had no problem with this side of the building about construction noise as posted in one of the previous reviews here. We booked the room for 2 nights, the third was on Hilton Honor points as we're silver members. Later on decided to extend our stay for another 2 nights. Well, all these reservations created quite a bit of confussion for the maid and front desk, who expected us to check-out after the first 2 nights, then after the third night, etc. In few words, they had us under 3 separate reservations for the same room, but their system doesn't cross reference, thus our room card got deactivated. The same thing happened after the third night. Several trips to the front desk, and talks with 2 managers got us nowhere. Along comes a third manager, who got the whole hing straighten-out and sent us a fruit basket as an appology. Other than this, it was a relaxing stay. One thing that I was rather annoyed by is that they charge for loungers and umbrellas for the beach, $50 for two a day. They should be free for guests as it is already a very expensive hotel. The food is good but extremely expensive. Go the cafeteria down the street for breakast and other meals, if you wish. They are cheap. Next to it, there is another convenience store cheaper than the one at the village. Another annoying thing was that unfortunely for us we chose the last week of March for this stay, and every little kid from CA and Japan was on vacation at the hotel. Not at all a pleasant experience. If we ever go back to Hawaii, we'll definetely stay at one of the other islands. Honolulu is by far extremely crowded.

<Content>What a Fantastic Facility My wife and I stayed at this hotel prior to going to Kaui. We spent four days here and let me tell you it wasn't enough. The rainbow hotel is the way to go, it was very updated, clean and close to the ocean and main pool. We had a room with an ocean view and view of Diamond Head. The hotel grounds were amazing as well as the beach. The food was very good and the staff couldnt have been better. The pools were very clean and warm, although the main pool seemed to close early every evening. Overall our experience was fantastic and we would recommend this hotel to anyone. By far the nicest hotel in Wakkiki.

<Content>Nice stay at HHV We just recently got back from our Hawaiian vacation. We stayed at the HHV because it was a work thing for me husband. I'm usually not a big fan of the chain type of hotels but we really had a good experience here. The grounds are kept up very well and it's really very clean. Our rooms were in the Tapa Tower and while they could use some renovations the view of Diamondback Mountain and the ocean were not to be beat. The beds were comfy and sheets of good quality. I would say overall our rooms were pretty clean (although a little Windex would go a long way on the windows/doors but that's a minor quibble). The beach area is beautiful. It is quite expensive to rent chairs and an umbrella for the day but we usually did to be a little more comfortable. We didn't use the pool very often since the ocean was pretty calm and we felt comfortable being in the water there. I will say that the food was pretty awful in our experience. I would get off property as much as possible. It's expensive and truly bad. We walked down to the Royal Hawaiian one night along the beach and we thought the HHV beach was by far the nicest and least busy.

<Content>Gorgeous grounds!!! We stayed two days at the Hilton Hawiian Village during our trip to Hawaii. Unfortunately I was very sick one of the days so I ended up staying in the room for the entire day, but the little that I saw of the resort, I was very impressed. The grounds are impeccable. The hotel is located on a beautiful beach. The pool is beautiful. Staying at the Hilton is almost like staying in a small village as there is shopping right on the premisis. The beds are very comfortable with down bedding and pillows. We booked the Ilikai tower. The entry way is marble and there is a doorman. The room was very nice and had a marble bathroom. I would hightly recommend staying at this hotel. It is everything that you would want for a vacation. We will return.

<Content>Great Hotel to stay at, but eat elsewhere. A bit slow in the posting here, but time for some honest feedback! 4 of us stayed at the Hilton in September 2006, booked it direct with the hilton website on a paynow, non-refundable deal. Not a problem as we weren't likely to need to change it. Upon arrival we got lucky and walked straight up to the desk (not the case later on as we saw some pretty serious queues), and they gave us a free upgrade to a better room in the Tapa tower facing towards Diamond Head. Rooms were huge compared to what you'd get in Europe, housekeeping was fine and there was no trouble with noise. The grounds are absolutely beautiful, kept spotlessly clean and meticulously groomed definitely a great place. Theres a range of shops selling all kinds of goods from super expensive shoes to polished shells - also a very handy store that sells the little things like waterproof pouches for the beach, tanning lotion, munchies and so on. We didn't use the pool as thats not really something we were interested in (may seem odd, but theres hundred of resorts closer to home for beaches and pools), but it was clean and well kept, plus they lend you towels which is a nice touch. Now, as you start to stray from simply staying at the HHV and you want to do things like eat, better get ready for things to take a downturn. We got a voucher from somewhere that gave us a discount for their buffet, even with the discount, it was overpriced (and remember we're used to pricing in the UK). The food was lukewarm, the selection limited and the service was slow. IMO Don't bother! We checked out the other restaurants on site and they seemed very expensive for what they offered so we went into town to eat all our meals. The cost of doing anything at the hilton seemed excessive actually. A couple of sun loungers for an afternoon on the beach was $28, basically anything beyond just using the room was going to cost you dearly.. One definite negative was the constant pitch to try and get you to go to the Grand Vacations presentations, it was very obvious that anyone who mentioned it was on a commission and so just about all the employees are trying to get you to register. We got round it by telling everyone that we were already registered and going to the presentation tomorrow... Other odds and ends of info that we collected: Public transport is pretty good if you can work it out. The car hire at the HHV sucks, the day we wanted a car we stood in line for an hour only to be told they had 2 cars left, and they were both Mustangs at $80 a day. While we stood there, a line of another 10-12 people built up behind us, but the guy behind the counter didn't think to tell that they'd run out of cars... Book a car a day or 2 before you need it. Can't comment on the Spa as we didn't use it - I considered a massage to ease away the strains on sitting on a plane for days, but was put off by the price and lack of availability. Getting a cab was easy as they flow through steadily, we never had to wait for long.In Summary, I highly recommend the HHV - just go somewhere else to eat.

<Content>Fantastic hotel I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for six nights starting Aril 14th with my husband and my son. I had booked a Garden view room and upon chek-in we were upgraded to an ocean view room in the Tapa Tower. The room was quite large and the view of the beach and DiamondHead was fantastic. The hotel has a great tropical feel. There are many restaurants to sample and lots of boutiques. The easy access to the beach is great with kids. The pool is very big and I was always able to get a seat. The buffet breakfast at the Tapa Cafe was okay, nothing great. The Atlantis sub is in my opinion not worth the money. You mostly seeships that were sunken there by Atlantis and very few fishes or other sea life. Go visit the islands. The beaches at Kailua are wonderful and there is hardly a soul there. My son had a great time playing in the big waves there.

<Content>Very Average My husband  I started our Hawaiian vacation at the HHV for 2 nights. This is huge resort (which we knew) on massive grounds. We found the resort itslef to be very beautiful, clean, and located in a great area of Wakiki.We did find the service to be a bit lacking. My husband  I are both Hilton Honor Gold members, and had to almost beg for the upgrade that we are supposed to get automatically. (we never even got one, and ended up garden view in the Kalia Tower). I was furious,since I had read many reviews on trip advsior in which people were upgraded for no reason, at all. Our HH guidelines state that upgrades will be granted when available - and they were not (b/c they were given to thers for no reason!!!)The waitress at the Super Pool was non-existant. There was one poor waitress for the whole pool. It averaged 20 minutes to get a beer. We ordered food and the garbage sat around for over 2 hours before it was finally removed.Our other main concern was the concierage. Our first one, Tony was AMAZING. However, the woman that we got later in our stay was horrid. She barley spoke a lick of English. We described that we wanted to go somewhere on the beach - nicer than Duke's....she said she couldn't help us b/c she was not familiar w/Dukes. Duke's is the most popular restaurant in Waikiki - this was laughable - she had nothing to recommend. Shame on the Hilton for having someone this lacking of training in their biggest resort.Overall, our stay was very average - just like any other Hilton, except we were not welcomed as return or valued guests.Sure, I'd go back - but only for the amiance of the beach. If you're planning your trip, I would stay at this Hilton - just manage your expectations low.

<Content>If youre looking for a Tropical Hawaiian feel...this is the place to stay We just returned from a 4 night stay here.We booked the cheapest room from the net ($229us, Terrace room) but when we arrived i told them it was my sisters b'day and if they can upgrade us for free since it was a special occassion.....and they did!! We got upgraded 5 categories and were soo happy!!They upgraded us to the Ali Tower in a Partial Ocean view room....we had view of the big super pool and the ocean...was awesome!!The Ali tower had its own private pool for guests too which was great, and it's the only tower at the Hilton where they have a doorman opening the main door for you (makes you feel like royalty) ~~ It's Much nicer than the Rainbow Tower.This hotel is the ultimate hawaiian experience, iv'e stayed at 6 different hotels in Honolulu and i have to say that this is the biggest one and it has a tropical feel to it, and also, the beach at the front is really big with white flat sand, not a lot of people...it's very nice! The hilton has 5 pools, the main pool is the biggest  nicest in Honolulu.I love lounging by the pool so this is important to me.This hotel is away from all the hustle and bustle (the main area in Honolulu) it's a bit of a walk if you like being in the centre of it all( the main strip) but u can walk it if u want. This resort has its own little area of shops and restaurants which is quite big and busy.We stayed here for 4 nights then we moved on and stayed at the Sheraton Princess Kaulani, which is right in the centre of honolulu. Nowhere as big as the Hilton but centrally located which we liked.I loved the hilton because it was so big and tropical looking, but i also loved the Sheraton Princess for its location. I have lots of photos....if you want any info or pics, email me at bernyzz@aol.comI want to go back to Hawaii!!!!!

<Content>The absolute best in Waikiki Another perfect stay! Great location, staff, and view. As busy as it was, this hotel is well run and maintained. We see no reason to try any other hotel in Honolulu. Thank you HHV, we loved our stay and can't wait to come back!

<Content>Best Beach in Waikiki I just returned from an 8 night family vacation at the Hawaiian Village, including taking 2 teenage girls. The HHV is a very nice resort that exceeded my expectations.The HHV happens to be on the widest and best part of Waikiki beach. In fact, only a select few hotels have actual beach (usable) frontage. Hotels like the Sheraton Waikiki and Halekulani are impressive, but do not have a beach you can enjoy. Other hotels on the beach have only a sliver of sand and are crowded (Outrigger, Royal Hawaiian). If being at a full-service RESORT with all the bells and whistles and directly on the beach, then you can't go wrong by staying at the HHV.We stayed in the Kalia tower 10th floor, which was nice with confortable beds and a good-sized bathroom. Since we booked with Hotwire, we had no choice in room options, and could have been located at the discretion of the resort. However, we asked the front desk for room with a good view, and were happy with the selection. Our room was clean, and the housekeeper worked hard despite the best efforts of the girls to leave their belongings where-ever. Although we could see the constuction of the new Waikiki tower off to the right, it was never a bother. There was very little construction noise that we could hear..The hotel grounds, shopping an restaurant choices were all excellent. Food was available at all price ranges. We ate at Bennihana (food good, prices moderate), Golden Dragon (great food, but the staff rushed us), CJ's (nice breakfast), Roundtable pizza (teen best, pretty good pizza) and Tropics which sits on the beach (nice view, good music, lunch, strong drinks). The grounds also included an ABC convenience store where everything was plentiful and, yes, cheap. Lastly, the Wianna restaurant located across the street from the hotel offered a huge breakfast (good) at low prices.We loved everything about the HHV. The grounds were beautiful, the staff was pleasant and helpful. The choices of things to do were nearly endless. The girls especially loved taking surfing lessons offered through the hotel. We thought the Friday night Hawaiian show, including fireworks outstanding even at $12 pp. The Kalia tower also has a private pool that was away from the crowds. This was a better option for us vs. the super pool, which was busy.Sure you pay more staying here, but everything is expensive in Hawaii. Go the the Hilton. Be impressed. Make family memories that last a life-time.

<Content>Absolutely first rate hotel I travel alot and stay at many hotels but this is one of the best. Its large but very well staffed. The hotel has probably the best location on Waikiki beach. It's also great for traveling with kids. Not only is the beach right at the hotel but there are some major attractions right at its doorstep. In particular, the Atlantis submarine tour that leaves from the hotel is awesome. And one of the most well-known big wave surfers, Clyde Aikau, gives lessons though the hotel. My 10-year-old son took a couple lessons from Clyde and is now hooked on surfing! Also, some excellent live music is offered at a few venues around the hotel every night. And to top off the week, a Polynesian cultural show on Friday evenings at the main pool with fireworks is very impressive.We stayed in the Rainbow tower which was excellent notwithstanding the construction going on nearby (although this might be an issue if you're on a low floor on the West side of the tower). Not an inexpensive hotel but the Hitlon is a very fine choice.

<Content>wedding meal Stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in the Kalia Tower. The room was very spacious and overlooked the sea. Although there was building work going on we were never disturbed by it. Stayed in the hotel with 14 other people, others stayed in the Kalia Tower, Rainbow Tower and one begining with an A I can't think of the name but it was the posh one, with it's own doorman. Whole village was brilliant although a little pricey, as there was more than 7 of us most of the time they autmatically added on 15% service charge. I read reviews about being charged for tea/coffee in rooms but this was not true. We had the wedding meal in the Bali on the Sea restaurant and the evening was perfect, the food was devine and the waiting staff superb, they gave us plastic cups so we could drink our champaigne on the beach after we had finished our meal and gave us complimentary truffles.

<Content>Caveat on 'Ocean View' Room We booked an ocean view room in the Rainbow Tower. There was a nice view of the harbor, but the only way you could actually see the ocean from our room would be to step out onto the balcony and lean over to see a small sliver of Pacific. I complained that this did not constitute an ocean view in my mind, but the hotel staff told me that is how the room is classified, and refused to move us. Other then this disappointment, the hotel was great.

<Content>You MUST stay here! My husband and I stayed here, last year during Christmas week. Although a little pricey, it's worth every penny. We had a room with an Ocean view. Within a short elevator ride and a (less than) 5 minute walk, we were right on the beach. The rooms were spacious, immaculately clean and came with small fridges. The beds were nice, fluffy and inviting. The staff was EXTREMELY friendly and ya can't beat the location. It's has a small mall in it with lots of restaurants to eat. We also loved the atmosphere and ambiance.

<Content>Happy at the Hilton I was born and raised on Oahu but have lived on the mainland for the last 16 plus years, during which time I had not been home to Hawaii until now. I spent 4 nights at the HHV in early April.The HHV was fabulous!!!! I had booked a garden view room in the Alii Tower and was upgraded to a one bedroom suite with a great view of Waikiki beach and Diamond Head on the top floor, at no extra charge. The bed was the most comfortable of any hotel I had stayed at. I had read that if you joing the Hilton Honors club on the Hilton's website that they will upgrade you if they can. I joined before booking, it is free.The grounds are lots of fun. I went with two sisters and my 8 year old son. There was so much to see with the variety of birds, koi fish and penguins right there on site. The beach is right outside the Alii tower, the Super Pool was great. My son had the kiddy pool practically to himself the one afternoon we spent there. I had read reviews before my trip where a few people thought it was crowded at the HHV. This was not my experiance. I always easily got a pool chair or spot on the beach. There are always people around but after all it is Waikiki not the rain forest.I loved all the shops in the village, so much to see. There was some kind of hula show I think every night (not toally sure) at the Super Pool which was great free entertainment. I had read that there was a one drink minimum but no night did I see anyone enforcing that.The one draw back was the food is EXPENSIVE throughout the village. Round table pizza was decent price wise. There are plenty of places to eat in Waikiki. You can get snacks and drinks at the ABC store which is in the village for a reasonable price Plan on having a good size food budget and you will be fine. In the Alii tower you get free appetizers (cheese, crackers and veges) from 5-7pm. The Alii tower also has a private pool, which we didn't use as the Super pool I thought was better.A poolside massage in the little cabana they have set up is a must!I recommend paying the extra $6.00 for valet parking. Self parking is $20.00 It is so much easier to pull up and walk away from your car. Plus while waiting for your car to be brought out in the morning you can be entertained by the parrot by the car check stand that says hello and Aloha He entertained my 8 year old the whole time.The staff was always helpful. I found that the nicer and friendlier you were to them the better service myself and others got. Never be rude, even if things get a little hectic. You are more likely to get extras and perks by having a good attitude and treating the staff well.I would go back in a heartbeat and stay at the HHV!

<Content>Excellent, but bring money! (Lots of it) We stayed in the Rainbow Tower from 4/4 - 4/12/07. There were ten of us (four adults, six kids from 9-14) in three rooms. Overall, I can rate this resort as excellent. There were really no bumps in the roadat all.We signed up as Hilton Honors members the day before we left. Based on this we were able to go to the faster check-in immediately upon arrival. We received a free upgrade to the beachfront rooms. We had previously asked for and received our rooms all in close proximity to each other and all with beautiful views of Diamond Head and Waikiki beach.The rooms were fairly typical and clean, new and nice. We received a $100.00 credit because our room had a ceiling problem that we were unable to locate at any time throughout our stay.There was some construction on the lagoon side of the hotel, but it did not bother us in the least. It looked like it will be wrapping upsoon.The Village is very nice, very well maintained, and it was great to give our kids some freedom to roam. The people working at the Village ranged from neutral to very nice. In other words, the worst you would encounter was a staff member going about his or her business without saying hello. The ones we DID engage were all friendly and helpful. No complaints.We went over Easter weekend and at times the property was very crowded. (One bellhop told us that the hotel was over 90% capacity.) These folks do an excellent job handling the crowds, though, and we never felt crowded or bothered by the people at all. (And we all comefrom a small town in Montana, so we would have noticed.)So, just so you don't think I am a Hilton employee, I will put a few negatives in here.First, it would have been nice if the maids changed the sheets every day or two. We're pretty sure they didn't. Think sand.Second, the Village is really up out of the action. To get to the main street for Waikiki, or the more populated portions of the beach,you will need to walk. No problem, though, because it doesn't hurt towalk off all the good food and drink!Last, and definitely not least, this place costs MONEY. Bud Light poolside? $7.50 plus tax and tip. Brunch for 9? $466.00. Beach chairs? $12.00 per day plus $26.00 for the umbrella (plus tip).I went to Walmart the first day. I bought a coffee maker and coffee for $25.00. It isn't just the price of the coffee ($3.50 for two cups), but the fact that you really don't want to walk all over for your second cup and belong. (Be warned: if the staff notices your coffee maker, they won't refill your supply of styrofoam coffee cups.)Also, at Walmart I bought 4 beach chairs for 4 bucks each and 2 boogie boards for $30.00. We left them with a family. If you're traveling there soon, look for the chairs (blue metal with rainbow cloth) and ask their owners for the 'pay it forward plan.' You might get them for nothing.We also loaded up on breakfast and sandwich items (there are refrigerators in the rooms). The $300.00 dinner each night is not such a big deal if you snack and eat other meals in the rooms.If you want to surf, skip the $90.00 surf lessons at the Village, and go down to Waikiki Center Beach where you can get them for $35.00.The Atlantis sub is good, but you're paying top dollar for what you get.You can buy a six back of beer at the on property ABC store, as well as other liquor, and drink your own on the beach. It's much cheaper and more convenient (and technically illegal, although no one said a word to us.)The Hale Koa next door has good food cheap and, if you want to feed your kids lunch, you can walk down to the first on-beach property (look for the subway sign) and they have comfort food for kids, although not cheap.I have been to Waikiki a number of times and it is clear they are trying to change Kalakaua Blvd. from a kitschy fun Hawaiian spot to Michigan Avenue of the Islands. Note to Developers: You might want to ask yourselves why the International Marketplace is still the most full.All in all, a great trip. I am happy to share more at bigskylaw@yahoo.com.Aloha.

<Content>terrible service My family has traveled to Oahu a handful of times and every time we stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Unfortunately, this last time may have been our last time staying there. The property is convenient. There are many shops and restaurants on site. The beach has become filled with debris. Just months ago, the beach was beautiful, however with the groundbreaking of their timeshare property, they have literally destroyed the beach. The staff does not understand the concept that the customer is always right. The room I checked into had 2 double beds. And on both of the beds, the sheets were dirty. I asked for the sheets to be changed. I waited 5 hours! When I complained to the front desk, they were very argumentative with me. They kept telling me that the room I had had only one bed. I can count! I was very surprised when management was rude. They didn't seem to care that there is a problem with their staff. They tried to move me to a room that runs for less than I paid. They clearly need a lesson in customer service. I did have other plans to stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village at the end of this month, but since my last stay, I have cancelled my reservations. I would highly recommend that if you are planning a trip to Oahu to avoid the Hilton Hawaiian Village.

<Content>I love this place We have stayed here before. 5 years ago we responded to a Hilton Vacation Club invitation and stayed in the Lagoon and Rainbow towers and we had a great time with our then 15 year old daughter.. I wanted to buy, and regret we did not buy. We love Hawaii and have been to Maui many times but our now college age daughter keeps us from going back as often as we would like.We went this past week to Oahu with my sister and her husband (who had never been to Hawaii before). We LOVED it. HHV is the only way to go in Waikiki. It has that resort feel that you need in Waikiki. It has easy access to all the historic sites and nightlife. We stayed in the the Rainbow tower and had a corner room with two lanais, both with ocean view. My sister and her husband had a partial ocean view that was quite nice, if you did not mind all the construction vehicles and noise. YES, there was noise. At one point I told my sister that whenever I heard jackhammers in the future I would think of Waikiki, and probably summon up the aromas of sunscreen and pineapple.This could have been a horrible vacation. I booked sightseeing trips through an internet site that was no longer honored. Therefore, we had some interesting adventures and some melted credit cards, they were used so frequently. (Top Ten should be considered your bottom ten, let us put it that way.) BUT, the HHV was our port in that particular storm and it held up well, construction noise and all. I have to also give tribute to the Royal Hawaiian Luau for honoring our prepaid booking, though they had received no money.Great points-the Resort feel, the views, the friendly staff, the very comfortable beds, the food was always good, too, if expensive, but hey, it's Hawaii.Negatives-construction noise, meal prices, but hey, it's HawaiiA very nice Easter break and introduction to Hawaii for my brother in law. Loved it.

<Content>Aloha!!!! Ok, what started out seeming like what was about to become a horrible honeymoon turned out to be one FANTASTIC trip!!! This was our first time for either one of us going to Hawaii. First of all, our plane landed a little bit late on 4/1/07. I had booked a corner room in the Rainbow Tower facing Diamond Head and the beach (on the other side of the construction). I was staying on Hilton Honors Points from my father (Diamond Member) and had booked the room close to 6 months in advance. When we arrived at around 4:30pm, I was informed that I had no room available for me and my wife. Hmmm...yes, I was furious. We had traveled over 5,000 miles from South Carolina, we were tired, had no sleep, and wanted to relax. They tried to put us in another tower but we would have no ocean view. Finally, Dave, the desk manager stepped in after I requested him. Within just a short few minutes, he told me he had us all set. He also told me that my corner room would be available on Monday if we chose to take it. He confirmed that we were in the Rainbow Tower on the 24th floor but would not give anymore information. Well, I was a little be reluctant but thankful that at least we had a room for the night. Bell service took our bags up for us and when we opened the hotel door....WOW!!!! That is all I got to say. WOW!!! An amazing 2 bathroom suite with 2 separate balconies overlooking Diamond Head and the beautiful Waikiki Beach. Even the bell man was like WOW!!!  I'm going to try not to write a novel but to give the reader's digest version, I was 100% satisfied with the service. And not to mention the upgrade in the room I got. The grounds at the Hilton is amazing. I had never seen a crew keep a place so clean. From morning time when they are raking the beach, cleaning cigarette butts up, and sweeping the side walks...till evening time when tiki torches are being lit and again, side walks being swept. I never had a problem with running out of towels or any other ammenity needed in the room. I was a little bit dissapointed in the service at the restaurants. But hey, if you had to deal with several 1,000 people a day, we would all get a little bit frusrated. My wife and I did not mind the busy Hilton. We are both in Public Service and are use to a hectic life. It is hard to find piece and quiet unless you take a trip to the Spa (recommended). Just to mention a few other things here. We were lucky to be staying on HHonors. We received a complimentary breakfast every morning and for just a mere $5 upgrade a piece, we could get the FULL Breakfast bar. Which to me was outstanding. Without the HHonors, it was well over $20 a person for the buffet. OK, so yes, the food at the Village is freaking expensive. But its pretty much expensive all over Oahu. The only restaurant we found to be cheap was McDonalds...HAHA!!! Oh, and the drinks were expensive. But again, drinks are expensive all over the island. The Valet service was awesome. And we would definitely recommend renting a car. And for the honeymooners and anyone else staying on Oahu for a special occassion, make sure and let the Rental Car company know this. I was upgraded to a convertible mustang with free GPS for a price cheaper than an economy car (Paid less than $40 a day through Hertz).  Heres a list of things I would recommed:1. Stay at the Hilton; The beach is huge; Not bad snorkeling for beginners like myself; Great service; Lots to do; Everything is convienent; The list could go on!!! Just do not be confined to the Hotel!!! Ate once at the Golden Dragon for dinner (not too bad) and ordered pizza from Round Table (impressive and not too pricey). All other dinners were eaten off the hotel grounds. 2. Rent a car; Travel the island; Get lost like we did; Its fun and adventerous3. GO TO PEARL HARBOR!!!!4. Go to Hy's Steakhouse; Hands down, the best steakhouse on the island; GREAT Service; Pricey yes..haha; Just go, trust me here; And also go to Sam Choy's; Very good food and not too pricey!!!5. Snorkel6. Go to other beaches on the island; there are much more quiet beaches that are less crowded7. Get the book Oahu Revealed; Read this book, it was a life saver for Oahu; It tells you all the do and donts and tell you all the good places to eat and the places that are not so good to eat; GET THE BOOK!!!8. Go to enterainment dot com!!! Pay the $37 for the Oahu book; This coupon book saved us well close to $500 on our trip; The book pays for itself with just one dinner9. Relax in the sun on the beach; The pool was just a little bit to busy for us.10. See Randy at the beach bar and tell him that Dustin and Jenn from South Carolina sent you; He is a great bartender!!! But dont get too hooked on the Tropical Itches, great drink and very addicting...HAHA; The drink even comes with a back scratcher which you will definitely need after a few of those!!!11. GO PARADISE COVE!!! Beat Lua on the Island hands down!!! Spend the extra money and get the Royal seating front stage like we did...it was worth it..plus came with 6 drink tickets a piece which came in handy!!!12. There is sooooo much I could say but just contact me if you have any other questions.  Things I was dissapointed in:1. The Polynesian Cultural Center; It was neat and interesting but not worth the money!!! Thank God I had a coupon for buy one get one free cause I would have been upset if I had to pay $80 for the two of us2. Dissapointed in the prices on the island; Outrageous for what they charge!!! Plan on taking a good chunk of change with ya!!!3. Little bit disspaointed in Aloha spirit with some of the locals; I mean, charging $20 for a flower lei...its definitely not like what you see on TV!!! (Dont get me wrong, by far, I have never seen a group of more happier people when it comes to the locals...and that is coming from a southern boy who is used to the southern hospitality!!!)4. Little bit disspointed in the cleanliness of the island; At the Hilton, is was emmaculate; But around the island, there needs to be a little more upkeep done; Lots of homeless people in the parks, lots of graffiti, and there was a good bit of trash and debris on many of the main roads!!! I had to come to the conclusion that Honolulu and Oahu in general was very populated and was very metro....Im sure more so than the other islands (which will be visited next time Im lucky enough to go to Hawaii)5. All in all, that is about all the complaints I have. I will be posting some pictures here soon. Please contact me if anyone has any questions. Im already planning a trip back for our 5 year anniversary!!! Aloha cousins and Maholo Hawaii for making our honeymoon paradise and a dream trip!!!

<Content>This is Paradise...LOVED IT!!!! My husband and I decided to spend our honeymoon in Hawaii and we went on the Pride of Hawaii cruise ship by NCL. We decided to spend an extra day in Oahu and stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort  Spa. It was beautiful. We stayed in room D1392. and the room could use some new paint on the walls, but everything was very clean. The bed was so comfortable that I wanted to bring it back home with us :) The view was spectacular. We decided on the garden view and we saw a wonderful view of the courtyards, the pools and the ocean. We could not have asked for a better view. They are doing construction at the resort but it was on the opposite end of where we stayed. The landscaping is superb and the staff is very friendly. The price is higher then I would have liked to have paid, but the view and the room was worth it. We would stay there again :) We had a wonderful time.

<Content>Best City Hotel Ever Yes, Waikiki is city. But where else do you get a city resort with blue ocean palm lined beaches? For us it was worth it to stay in the Alii'i Tower. It was an oasis of quiet and calm in a rather bustling setting. Plenty of staff at the desk and they're pretty helpful. There is a concierge desk but we found them, frankly, pretty unhelpful. The folks at the desk were more knowledgeable and accommodating. In fact, one day I heard the concierge on duty getting advice from the desk clerk about which, if any, restaurants in the area were worth recommending.Overall, this resort may suffer a bit from the fact that Oahu is now so popular that the cost of living makes it almost prohibitive for service personnel to live there. The staff were all pleasant but sometimes a little under trained it seemed.Yet we were really pleased with the Alii'iTower. Perhaps it helped that they upgraded us to a two room suite. But this hotel within the resort does provide a relaxed setting. The pool, for instance, gives the full impression of being right on the beach -- but in reality is a floor above it and without the sand. BTW, if you're staying in Alii'i and are a Gold or Platinum member, you probably don't need to pay the extra for the Bounceback Rate unless you really have to have an omelet every day. At least when we stayed there Gold and Platinum members could have a free continental breakfast by the pool every morning and also use the coupon toward the price of a complete breakfast on those days you would want it. And if you want a really good (and much cheaper) hamburger type menu, there's a new Cheeseburger in Paradise outlet just two blocks away (although we found the walk to the original at the other end of Waikiki to be worth it.)You also might want to skip the thought of using the cab service touted on their website to come from the airport. Unless you actually hire the upgraded limo service, all you get is a cab that meters you the same as every other cab you can get right at the airport -- and we had to wait half an hour for the hotel dispatched cab to arrive.Overall, this was a great way to begin our Hawaiian vacation with five days of decompression before heading to the Big Island.

<Content>Very disappointing Looking back on our experience at this hotel, I have a difficult time finding positive things to say. The food was horrible, the facility was in need of repair every where we looked, it was very overpriced and the staff were very unhelpful. There were several mistakes made by the hotel, and we never once received an apology; only an argument. Instead of the 'customer is always right' attitude, there was defensiveness the moment we presented an issue. If we were the type of customers that attacked, I would understand. However, we are often overly-kind; not wanting to ever raise a fuss. However, when we would question this hotel about a problem (an erroneous charge on our bill amongst other things), they would only argue with us as to why they couldn't possibly have made a mistake (when, in fact, they did). We had to take up our billing issue with management who also started the conversation by interrupting and arguing with us. Even when we proved our case, no one ever apologized. There are plenty of wonderful hotels in Oahu. Avoid this one!

<Content>Hilton:The only resort like in Hawaii, great for family This is it! We stayed in Alii Tower and we, include my kids (10 and 12) loved it! This is the only resort like hotel in Honolulu. The hotel is very specious throught the property, and my kids like these little zoo like place (penguin, framingo, ducks and much more) wide open and able to touch them. Upon on arrival, we were taken directly to our room by a personal receptionist. He gave us a breif orientation of the hotel. Then there was fruit tray, ice was already in the room. The maid service comes at least twice daily. Unlike any other hotels on Waikiki beach, the beach in front of Hilton is very large and never get into situation when you would fight for a space. We booked through Amex Platinum card, which comes with room upgrade, free breakfast daily, one free lunch in addition to daily evening odvre that Hilton offers to all Alii Tower guests. Coming from east coast and with time difference, the odvre actually served as our dinner so we saved a lot on meal expenses. The only downside to this hotel is a little away from the shopping area (10 minute walk), which was fine as I like quieter over convinience. There is ABC store in the hotel and you can get all the necessities there. We were spoiled with the exceptional services that we never experienced in any other hotels before, we will come back to Hilton next time.

<Content>Paradise Found!!!!!!! I can't say enough on how our family LOVED this property! It was a bit pricey BUT when you go on vacation to escape everyday life it is worth it! We stayed in the Ali'i Tower of HHV. It was everything Frommer recommended, trip advisor member reviews and more!!!!!!!!! We loved our stay so much we purchased a timeshare at Hilton Hawaiian Village. The plans for vacation owners at the HHV property is exciting...members only pool (largest in the state), water slides, brand new lagoon access,...We have young children so the HHV property is a perfect fit for our needs. Calm tides at the beach, kid pool, variety of restaurants, ABC store, family friendly environment, babysitting (Keiki club for kids 5-12 yrs old),....Our daughter spent an afternoon in the Keiki club and loved it. Our son is only three so he will be able to do the Keiki club on our next trip there! There is so much to say about our trip I can't even begin to put into words how much of a memorable vacation this was. I have been to Maui and Oahu 4 times and it is even more beautiful than I remember. We liked visiting the islands when the whales and dolphins can be seen. Our vacation was March 27, 2007-April 2, 2007. We saw many whales at the beach just past Hanauma Bay. There are many activites to do on Oahu. We took a surfing lesson from the instructors at the HHV. -Went on the Submarine Tour-Snorkeled Hanauma Bay (awesome especially if you get there when they open at 8am b/c it gets busy!)-Toured the Dole Plantation (took the train ride)-Paradise Cove Luau (food was not that great  show was okay...we didn't like having to ride the bus even though our tour guide/waitress was hilarious  made the ride fun! It's just a long time for young kids 3:50pm-10:30pm)-Hung out at Sandy Beach  Three Tables Beach (spectacular)-Went to the Costco right before Hanauma Bay (had the cheapest lunch there of the trip :) Bought bottled water, beach chairs, booster seat for the rental car, $36 bathing suit since all of my Spiegal order didn't arrive before we left, snacks,...P.S. Costco carries traditional Hawaiian jewelry aka bangle bracelets for alot less than the jewelry stores!!!!!!!!!!!-Went to Walmart near Ala Moana shopping center for essentials and Hawaiian gifts-the island favorite candies-Went to the Verizon Store to get my husband a new phone because it got wet in the beach bag and killed it....the manager was pretty nice and gave me a good upgrade after I bargained with her.There is still alot of things we want to go back and do but the week FLEW by!!!!!!!!!! We would have liked to go to the Shorebird  Dukes restaurants b/c we heard excellent reviews from fellow hotel guests. We wanted to go to Sea Life Park and swim with the dolphins. P.S. We booked our hotel directly through HIlton Hawaiian Village and used our AAA membership. Our rate was $323 for an OCEANVIEW room. Ask for a OCEANFRONT room if you stay in the Ali'i Tower. I didn't know that when we checked in and they are the same price. Our view was good but not as GREAT as the OCEANFRONT rooms.We booked our rental car on Priceline and bid $29 on an SUV and it was accepted. We got a new Chevy Trailblazer from AVIS and we were very happy with that. Even though VALET parking at HHV is $25 a day!!!!! Ouch! We loved having a car and thought is was well worth it and their valet attendants do an EXCELLENT job. Besides self parking was $20 a day...not much difference in price so we said what is another $5 a day!!!!Our flight we booked directly through United Airlines because their major HUB is Denver so we got better flight selections and rates. We had a direct flight to Honolulu from Denver and on the return flight we went through LAX. Our roundtrip fare was $565 a person because we left on a Tuesday and returned on a Tuesday--a cheaper day to fly!If you have any questions, feel free to drop us an email!!! Mahalo

<Content>Hilton best hotel on beach Enjoyable hotel in the best location for families in honolulu. We booked via AAA as we received a better rate then any other web service. Paid 260 per night ( no breaky ) got adjoining rooms as we rented 2 rooms. ( suites were way over priced in this property )We choose the Alli tower based on reviews here. Really dont think the Alii was worth the extra money a 450 sq ft room was better then the 250 sq in some of the other towers, but location wise i would have picked the diamond tower.Our rooms was garden view initially as my preference ( especially with non refundable rate ) is to try and get an upgrade with or without payment after i check out the hotel.We had garden view with a view of the ocean at an angle. Room was clean, well appointed, staff was great and friendlly.Honolulu is like tokyo, full of Japenese (as is the hotel) which is very denselly packed by buildings and people. If you don't like crowds, don't try honolulu. We are in Maui (earlly april) and the diffrence is staggering. Japenese generally like quality and efficiency and you can understand why they feel comfortable in honolulu.Most of the hotels are on busy roads or away from the beach and you could see the families lugging chairs, beach toys and kids on daily pilgrimages to the very very overcrowded beaches.Yes folks we are talking wall to wall people here.I would reccomend the Hilton as a true resort, with a very much less crowded beach, right at the property line.I would make sure to stay away from roads and ESPECIALLY service lanes. Otherwise you will be accosted by the NOISE of the Hawaiin national bird. ( back-up beepers from delivery trucks ) You can hear these beepers from 4:30 am on in honolulu. Especially in the denser areas of honolulu or on the service lane of the Alii tower. In fairness the noise comes from everwhere ( echoes, concrete jungle ) especially the Hale Kole?? Military hotel next to the Hilton.Yes food and drinks are expensive at this property, but we have paid much more.Overall after walking the beach and looking at the 4 other beachfront hotels, i was extremelly happy with the Hilton.Far enough away, with nice pools and a resort feel, yet within easy walking distance of everything honolulu has to offer.

<Content>Nice hotel too far away from downtown I live on the Big Island and went to Oahu for a few days on vacation. This hotel is ok, the rooms are really nice but it is so far away from downtown Waikiki that it became a pain. We stayed in the Rainbow tower with an Ocean view. The room was a suit and was huge! It had two full bath rooms a sofa sleeper, king bed, dinning table, and two balconies. I really loved the room!This hotel has great wildlife including penguins and pink flamingos along with lots of fish. The pool was a little small but my 1 year old enjoyed it. The sand in front of the hotel is not as nice as that further down Waikiki but it is all right. We only tried out a few of the hotel restaurants. The beach side cafe was nice but expensive for lunch. We also ate at the Rainbow Lanai which was awful. The decor looked like it was out of the 80's and food was bad. I think there was a seafood buffet the night we were there and it smelled awful, none of us had the buffet. I can't remember the name of the place we ate breakfast but they had an ok buffet.The Hilton has a huge shopping area which, for some, may make up for being away from downtown.My biggest issue, as I mentioned, is the difficulty getting downtown. The Hilton sits at the very end of Waikiki and I don't think is technically on Waikiki. But the point is that after you have eaten at all of the Hilton's restaurants it is a 15 min bus ride to other restaurants and with screaming hunger children that is a ways to go. There is a free trolley to the Galleria but it just seemed like such a hassle. I would rather stay at Royal Hawaiian or the Sheraton and be just down the street from everything.

<Content>Big and brash-but sometimes even beautiful The Americans really are masters of the large hotel universe. Not for nothing does Las Vegas have 7 of the10 largest hotels in the world-and the Hilton Hawaiian Village, with its over 3000 rooms , is by far the largest hotel in Waikiki.Three things are essential to running a really large hotel successfully. Superb efficiency and systems. We have stayed at this Hilton 4 times over the last two years .It really runs smoothly, whatever the weather and however many tourists throng the complex. Everything works and ,if you have reason to call down for anything, the staff normally come quickly. The check in lines move reasonably fast and the penguins in the fish ponds are happy to perform for the kids.Secondly a massive hotel like this has to appeal to all sorts of people. A small boutique hotel can be targeted exactly at a niche market of potential guests. A very large hotel has to appeal to everyone. So they will have a massive range of rooms. So in a hotel of this size and complexity it is useless to talk about room sizes or types There will just be too many.. All you can say is that even the worst and cheapest room will still be a Hilton double- and the best room will probably rival anything in Waikiki- and most rooms will be somewhere in between. And the hotel has to have a wide range of restaurants running from fast food type burgers at one extreme to Hilton style haute cuisine on the other .The Hilton has 18 food outlets including those in the main towers and the attached shopping arcade.Thirdly a very large hotel, if it is to make money, has to attract large organised groups, whether they are tour groups, conference attendees, or those just enjoying corporate junkets. This Hilton, whenever we have been there, has always had plenty of guests sporting various kinds of labels round their necks and / or pinned to their breasts clearly not shy to announce their identities to the world .The Hilton advertises itself as being on the beach. But if you are in the Tapa or Kalia towers then you would probably be physically closer to the beach if you were staying in hotels not actually beach side like the Embassy Suites or the Waikiki Parc. Location wise then it may indeed be on the seas shore but it is not that close to the centre. It is really a bit out of the way , right at the end of Waikiki beach next to the Alii Wai yacht harbour. Not nearly so handy for downtown as its competitors the Sheratons and the Hyatt. But Waikiki is so compact, everything is still within walking distance.Land is of course highly expensive in Waikiki . So all the hotels are high rise and most of the Hilton Towers are over 30 floors. Few of the hotels will have any kind of garden-but the Hilton does its best with cleverly planted trees and shrubs. And none of the hotels can afford to have a massive swimming pool .But the Hilton , as befits its status as the largest hotel, also boasts the largest pool .This is still on the small side if the hotel is full. But who wants a pool anyway if the beautiful Pacific is just a few steps away? And anyway, if you don鈥檛 mind swimming in the shade, there is another smaller pool by the Tapas towers.The Hilton鈥檚 five major Towers do differ somewhat. The Alii tower,( which we have yet to be invited to grace with our presence) has its own swimming pool and private entrance complete with frock coated porter at the door to keep the ordinary public out,.. The Rainbow tower has great views but is showing its age a bit. In the Tapa tower the higher floor rooms also have good views, and the Kailua tower , the furthest from the beach and , I hesitate to say, shared with time sharing condos, is probably the cheapest. Most of the time sharers however are concentrated in the fifth building the Lagoon tower with their own pool etc .But it is of course open for them to partake also in any of the main hotels amenities .And as always in Waikiki, although it may not be yet quite as bad as Vegas , there is building going on everywhere. So, be warned, by the time you read this review, it may be out of date.

<Content>Mostly good Ok, to start with, my Wife and I are not the people you see posting that complain about every little thing.. we always have fun and enjoy a holiday and are very much into making lemonade from lemons.. so, with that in mind, I'll give my two cents worth.The HHV is a beautiful hotel complex, has a lovely beach, and some nice restaurants.. we really enjoyed the Deli, the sandwiches, while not cheap, are excellent, and the breakfast there was really good as well. Japanese restaurant was not bad - try the soft-shell crab tempura.. the pizza from the pizza joint was also great - ate it on the beach after dark.. the ice cream shop was also really good (but over-priced). The Friday night fireworks are excellent, and most enjoyable from the beach.. and for a place where everything seems over-priced, the ABC store on premises is very handy and very low-priced for snacks, beach towels, etc.. we were there every day for something..The cons - which in no way created any significant impact on our trip: - they advertise a honeymoon upgrade - which they didn't deliver on - so, while the room was great (partial ocean view, Tapa Tower) - best to assume you won't get the upgrade and not be dissappointed;- they sell the hotel to conventions on weekends, who pretty much overtake the resort.. both weekends we were there (two weeks) they had large conventions and roped off the superpool area for their benefit.. again, we spent almost all our water time in the ocean, so it wasn't a big deal, but be ware - the weekends are busy, crowded and you're not likely going to access the superpool after 6:00pm;- the hotel is a little bit isolated from the waikiki main downtown area, and it's a bit of a trek to walk to the centre of things (though that can also be a plus).. and walking off all the food and drink we had was not at all a bad idea..- parking is somewhat expensive, and they did overcharge us - two extra days beyond what we asked for..All in all, I would give HHV an 8/10 - you certainly will not be unhappy with the rooms or the beach area - and the little reef off the beach actually has some not bad snorkeling for fun on the ocean side of the reef.. though nothing like Hanauma or Makaha..

<Content>Excellent Resort  Just got back from having 5 nights at the Hilton and it was amazing. We were lucky to get upgraded when we arrived and had access to additional pool areas. Overall a great hotel with wonderful food  facilities. I would go and stay there again for sure. The only only hiccup was that the front desk service on arrival was very ordinary.

<Content>The hidden Jewel of Oahu, Love this Hotel! Our trip to Hawaii was 7 nights. We booked 5 nights at the popular Royal Hawaiian Hotel (we only stayed there 5 nights because the rate was so high but wanted to experience it because of all the great things we had heard and read about it). The other 2 nights we booked at the Hilton Hawaiian Village as Hilton Honors Gold members. We wish now that it had been the entire 7 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village! This hotel is beautiful and the staff and service are some of the BEST we have ever experienced! The hotel grounds are beautiful and very well kept. The pool areas (more than one!) are spacious clean and relaxing. The whole atmosphere at Hilton Hawaiian Village complex is OUTSTANDING! We will without a doubt never stay anywhere in Ohau/Honolulu but HERE!!!!!!!!! The Royal Hawaiian can not compare with the Hilton Hawaiian Village in my opinion!

<Content>Something for everyone Spent 9 nights here from 2 March. Booked the Alli tower and it was wonderful. Room had 2 double beds and was spacious with an good bathroom and dressing area- this meant 2 separate vanities- a great bonus for a mother- daughter combination. Service in this tower is superior-the pool is private for use of guests of this building only, it had a nice feel. Evening canapes were complimentary and quite good - choice of 2 hot finger foods plus a more healthy offering of dips and vegetables, cheese and biscuits.Turndown service with chocolates and evening room refresh made us feel very special. Tons of complimentary tea, coffee , water also provided.As a gold honors there was a complimentary continental breakfast- nothing fancy but more than adequate and a good upgrade deal was available if you wanted the hot breakfast. Being Hawaii the tropical fruit was fresh and sweet. We ate in some of the on site restauants and all very acceptable- expensive but in a resort like this not surprising.There is a 24 hr diner called Wailana across the road- try it- cheap and a chance to see local characters.

<Content>Loud, Crowded, and Greedy OK, how is this for starters: You are generously allowed to brew ONE pouch of coffee everyday for free ... use any more of the coffee pouches and there will be a $3.75 charge to your room! If you touch one of the tea bags the charge is $2.50, and each TINY bottle of water is $3.00. Tell me someting, when the room rate starts at $299/night at the lowest of low seasons and can rise as high as $775, is this really necessary? Meanwhile, as some previous reviews have noted, staying here is NO restful island vacation. Come here if you want big city noise, lights, crowds, and traffic. This hotel (which is made up of several high rise towers interspersed with woefully tiny pools and small patches of green areas) has been accurately described by an earlier reviewer as Manhattan with a couple of palm trees. I stayed on the 26th floor at the tower closest to the ocean and when I stepped out onto the balcony all I could hear was traffic and police sirens and car alarms and airplanes ... get the picture? Anyhow, I don't think after this month's trip I'll ever return to this particular property again ... the world has too many beautiful places for me to want to waste my time here any more.

<Content>Very nice resort experience My husband and I try to get to Hawaii at least once a year and we had not been to Oahu for awhile and decided to try the Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort. It is a huge sprawling complex of different towers that have (I'm told) around 3400 rooms. So this is not some little Mom  Pop hotel. We were booked into the Rainbow tower with an oceanview with a king sized bed. However, the desk clerk told me when checking in that the room had a decent view but was overlooking all the construction going on and asked if we would mind moving to an ocean/Diamondhead view with double beds instead of a king sized bed. We agreed and were very happy. The view was awesome. We could see the ocean, Diamondhead, the beach, etc. This resort has numerous restaurants and shops all throughout the resort. Too many to name or attempt to name here. I looked at prices and felt many were high (of course everything is expensive in Hawaii) so we did not eat on property except for one morning we had breakfast in the New York Deli there. It was good and the portions huge. We did not finish there was so much food!!! I felt considering how much food was given the price was reasonable.There are many high end retail stores in the resort and also an ABC Store (for those of you not having been to Hawaii, these small stores are scattered throughout Hawaii and offer food, drink, medication, tee-shirts, souvenirs, etc at reasonable prices) which was very nice to have there. You can purchase your own beer, soda pop, candy, chips etc. So that was nice to have onsite. If one wanted to youwould never have to leave the resort as restaurants, shopping, swimming, the beach is all right there. There are several pools, bars, etc. scattered throughout the property. My husband and I are not ones to lie in the sun next to a swimming pool, but for those who want to do that, the pools looked clean and well maintained. Of course where ever there is a swimming pool, there are lots of kids. While I don't have small children, the resort seemed family friendly.They have a spa onsite and I went one evening and had a massage which was excellent. The spa was beautifully appointed and very relaxing. I recommend if you are staying there and have the time to work in a spa treatment. I think you will find it worth it.The staff at this resort were all very nice and helpful to my husband and I. We enjoyed our stay here very much and hope to go again. Again, the only thing I would caution against is if you want to go to Hawaii to get away from people, this would not be the place for you. It is a very busy, popular resort.

<Content>Not For Young Couples On A Romantic Vacation I was in Hawaii for 2 weeks - went to Oahu, Maui and Kona. In Oahu, I stayed at the Halekulani and the Hilton Hawaiian Village. First, my fiancee and I are both 26 - we do not have kids, and this is a family resort. Second, if you go, stay at the Rainbow Tower, as this tower has the best view of the ocean.We had a corner deluxe ocean view room on the 20th floor and it was very nice. Rooms are old, water is not complimentary after the first two bottles and the bathrooms are old as well. If it were not for the view, I would have given this hotel 1 star.Village restaurants were good, especially the japanese cuisine. I found the beach to be very crowded and the pool as well. This hotel was not very relaxing.If you have family, probably nice to go here with the wide range of towers and family oriented atmosphere. Not for young couples

<Content>Bad start, great finish If you are picky about your hotel room, read this! We booked our room at the hilton through a tour company. I chose this resort because I wanted the resort feel and didn't want to stay in the midst of highrises and traffic. Saying that, we booked a run of the house room, which meant we werent gauranteed to be in a certain tower. However, we were slated to have a garden view room. After researching the different towers on the property, I called both the Hilton central reservation line and the hotel directly and requested the Alli tower or the Rainbow tower, since all of the reviews I read listed those two towers as the best. I did say though, that the only thing that really mattered to me was that we had a view of the pool or a garden -- anything troical feeling; I actually didn't care if we were even able to see the ocean as long as I wasnt overlooking the City or the busy road that runs behind the hilton. So, upon arriving at the hotel at 1:00 a.m. with two kids and a 13 hour travel day behind us, I went to check us in, expecting, at the very least, a room overlooking a palm tree. I was informed that we had been upgraded to a partial ocean view room (great, I thought) in the Tapa tower. When I asked to see where our room was on the map, it was at the back of the tower overlooking, you guessed it, the super busy road. Furthermore, I asked her how that was considered a partial ocean view when the ocean was on the opposite side of the building. (to be fair, if you leaned over the balcony and twisted your head as far as it could go, you could see a sliver of the ocean). Anyway, I asked if we could have a different room. I said that I didnt care about the partial ocean view and that I really was fine with something overlooking the garden or the pool or Anything green and not noisy. After dissapearing into the back office for 10 minutes to talk to a manager, she came back insisting that there was not a single other room in the hotel (of 3400 rooms I should point out) that was free. I pressed the point, and finally she told me that we could have another room in the same tower (overlooking another road) but that it would be an extra $60.00 a night since it had one king and not two doubles! I said no and she said I could check back in the morning. She seemed very put out and wasnt friendly at all. We went to the room and while it was very spacious, it was very noisy. Even though we were on the 21st floor, the beeping of delivery trucks woke me up at 6:00 a.m. the next morning. Needless to say, I was back at the desk the next morning. Another girl again dissapeared into the back for 15 minutes and came back saying that my request was in but they couldent gaurantee a move. I have to say I was a little shocked at there resistance considering how often I read that people were automatically upgraded for free. Also, I didnt think my request was unreasonable since they had upgraded me to a partial ocean view and I was asking them to downgrade me to a garden view! Anyway, I was told to come back at 2 in the afternoon. I went back at noon and this time stood in the Hilton honors line (we had signed up before we left) and made sure that I spoke to a Male ( I was tired of the unhelpful ladies that were working there). Within 3 minutes he said that I we could move to the diamond head tower, overlooking the pool. We started talking and I inquired about how one goes about getting into the Alli tower and he said that he would let us upgrade to that tower for only $40.00 extra a night. I thought this was more than worth it since you get free appetizers every night in that tower, plus access to your own pool and hottub. It was a great choice! The room was great. very spacious. He knew we had two kids and that I wanted to be by the pool so he found a room (202) that was actually on the deck of the pool. You just had to go up three steps and you were there. We lived by the pool , and I have to say that it was great not having to fight the crowds in the other pools. Plus, the hot tub was great, with a fantastic view of the ocean. The grounds of the resort are great and whenever we left and headed into the crazy traffic I couldent wait to get back to the resort. Also, the beach in front of the hilton is less busy and bigger thatn other areas of the beach. We found the restaurants to be expensive (ie-$14.00 for a burger with no fries and $3.50 for a small glass of pop with NO refill) but splurged a few times. Try the Shorebird restaurant at the Outrigger down the beach for a great buffet breakfast and a good lunch menu at reasonable prices. We spent a small fortune at the ABC store buying stuff for breakfast, alcohol, sunscreen etc. but the prices were good. We spent a day at Sandy beach (not good for small kids). We were actually told by the lifegaurd that we should not stay there because the waves were so hard, but we loved it. We were just careful not to go in very far because I could see how it is dangerous. Also, we took the outrigger catamaran's sailboat tour and that was great. We saw some whales and snorkelled with sea turtles (the highlight of my trip!). Overall, we ended up loving the hotel, but if we do go back , I would want to book a gauranteed spot in the Alli tower. Stay here if you can!! If you have any questions about the resort or the rooms, email me at jandkgun@telus.net..

<Content>Wow! Stayed here with a group for a business trip and all I can say is, wow! The hotel is clean, the staff professional and friendly, the location can not be beat, and the rooms were outstanding!! I can't believe it's ranked as low as it is (especially behind the Aqua Plams!!!) Do yourself a favor, spend the extra money, and stay at a hotel designed to give you the best Hawaiian vacation. (By the way, you walk out of the Hilton (the Rainbow Tower) and right onto the beach...you can't do that from some of the others in the top ten.)

<Content>Beautiful! The Hilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort  Spa at Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii was abslutely breathtaking. Beautiful views of waikiki beach. The rooms had everything you need and the feathertop beds were excellent! The Hilton Hawaiian is it's own little town with breathtaking views. I would recomend this hotel to everyone! Can't wait til I go back.

<Content>Paradise! Family from upstate NY recently stayed at this hotel and loved it. Staff was friendly and extremely helpful. Kings jubiliee on Friday night is worth the $12/person. Hotel was clean with new furnishings (Diamond Head Tower) Pools were lovely. This hotel has its own shopping village, which was VERY expensive. Hotel is surrounded by upscale designer stores. Hotel restaurants were very pricey also, and I wouldn't waste my time or money going to them again. Wailana Coffee House is across the street and had more reasonable prices...my kids called it the Hawaiian Friendly's. Ate there every morning. Ate lunch/supper at other restaurants within walking distance of hotel again for more reasonable prices. Would stay at this hotel again, but probably would visit a different island next time for some variety.

<Content>Ruined I've used 'Ruined' as the title for this review as that is what this place has done for the other hotels - I could only go back to Hilton.Spent five nights for my honeymoon back in January 2006  can honestly say it was the best hotel I've stayed at.Hilton Gold member so was upgraded to a sea view in the Rainbow tower and what a view.Apart from a few very minor issues like confusion on the part of the waiter about a dinner deal that was advertised in the room and limited construction noise everything else went wonderfully. (We got the meal that was advertised and the hotel moved us to an even beter room!).The village really is like a village, almost no need to venture from the complex  the beach area is so spacious unlike further down the beach where the majority of the hotels are and it seems like a fight to get any space.Its not cheap but without doubt worth every penny and there are cheaper options to buy goods like an ABC store.Will definitely go back.

<Content>Buyer beware of store rip off -- Phillip Rickard I have no substantive beef with the Hilton per se, but I want all tourists who stay there to be aware of the shops in the hotel mall area. My husband travels to Honolulu at least monthly and usually stays at the Hilton when doing business. Shortly before Christmas, he thought he would do some shopping at Phillip Rickard. When he bought several rather pricey pieces of jewelry, he asked about return policy and was told he could not get a refund but could exchange. The receipt for purchase he was given stated no refund/exchange only. When, a month later he returned to exchange two items, not only was he told he could not exchange them but there would also be a 15% restocking fee. There was no one in authority at the store, but Angie somewhere else finally relented and let him exchange after much back and forth banter, but charged more for the exact same items in white rather than yellow gold AND insisted on this exhorbitant restocking fee which is no where on the sales receipt or was it posted in the store. We all know that these stores sell merchandise at top dollar, but these hidden costs are just a slap in the face to customers/tourists. Do not under any circumstances shop at this store. They don't gift wrap, they just rip you off.

<Content>Great Hotel! We loved the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We stayed in the Tapa Tower and were upgraded to an Ocean View room upon check-in. Everybody was friendly and helpful. Our rooms were nice. We traveled with 3 families and children ages 6 weeks through 13 years old. The kid's loved the place and the weekend entertainment. This hotel has everything you need. If you choose to, you would never need to leave the resort. It is walking distance to the International Marketplace and Waikiki famed restaurants. We walked to town everyday for shopping and dining. Oahu has so much to see - venture out to the North Shore and Huaname Bay. The hotel buffet breakfast was adequate, Benihana's was excellent, but we were disappointed with the the poolside dining - food was not very good or of any quality, but the drinks were good.We plan to go back again. We also love the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island.Eatieries - Try the Shorebird Buffet (in the Outrigger Waikiki), and for the best breakfast in town (and cheapest) try the Coffee House across from the Hilton. Also, go to Dukes of Waikiki for a good seafood dinner.

<Content>Nice, but busy We also stayed in the Hilton over the pro-bowl weekend, not on purpose I might add. Been English we had no idea who these 'famous' people were. We had an oceanview room in the rainbow tower. While the view was great and the room immaculately clean, it was all a little tired and in need of redecoration.We enjoyed our four night stay although food and drink within the complex is expensive.Having seen three of the other islands, Oahu was not my favourite by any means. I found Honolulu to be very much like LA and Wakiki beach was very crowded.

<Content>We'll be back!! We just returned from our 2nd stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and loved it agin! Our room was ocean front in the Rainbow Tower with a Diamond Head view. Stunning, awsome view!!We slept with the sliding door open every night because the sound of the waves lulled us to sleep. Our room had no hint of smoke and was clean and fresh. Not huge, but the view and sound of the ocean was why we asked for the upgrade to ocean front. This is one reason we remain a Gold member of Hilton Honuors.......the upgrade is free!!!! Both trips we've asked for and rec'd a room at the Rainbow tower. Keep in mind that this year we were there the week of the Pro Bowl and rooms were hard to come by even for guests paying over $500/night. But, we got the room anyway. We were there using one of the Hilton Honors rewards. With our stay we rec'd a free contiental breakfast each morning at one of three locations. We ate at the Rainbow Lanai and loved it. This restuarant is located right at the edge of the beach and the atmosphere is great. They offer to go boxes which we used a couple of times and took our breakfast out on the beach. Fresh pineapple....very fresh, Mango and other choices plus pastries and meats were more than enough. We could have upgraded for a few bucks and had a full cooked to order breakfast, which looked fantastic, but were so happy with the contiental that we just saved the money.The beach on the Hilton property is the widest in Wikiki and although maybe a litter tamer than some down the beach a mile or so it really has a Hawaiian feel to it. There is a (almost dead) reef only 25 yards out and to our surprise had alot of marine life on it. Even an eel! Not bad for novice and experienced snorklers.The beach is so wide that you can find a spot even getting there in mid afternoon. Not so down the beach a few hotels........elbow to elbow.The big pool filled up pretty early, but they have pool side service and they keep the pool temp. really cold so it very refreshing.There are ALOT of shops on property from the ABC store (if you don't know what this is imagine 7-11 with a palm tree and fresh pineapple) to mega expensive fashion stores.There are about as many resturants as shops. Bali by the Sea is very nice, The Rainbow Lanai has a very good seafood buffet on Saturdays and a Hawaiian one on Fridays. The food at Sergios was outstanding. There is a pool side bar and a hotdog place under the Rainbow tower right on the beach.Yes there is construction going on so Don't get a room on the harbor side of the Rainbow tower. Keep in mind that parking is $20/day and you can get around using the trolley for only $2/person per trip. We have found the Hilton employees very friendly and helpful both of our stays. Be nice and they will be nice back. I saw some VERY demanding/rude guests and I have to imagine I'd be alittle cranky too if someone was that high and mighty.There are many, many hotels to stay in on this beach but we'd ask....why stay anywhere else? Everything we like is at this hotel!!!!! So far the Hilton is batting a thousand.

<Content>I Had a Free Room Two things, first.One, I'm picky.Two, this stay was free for me as a friend was attending a conference and her husband could not join her -- I was asked if I'd like to come along and well, I work for an airline and get nearly free airfare and so, what could I say? I went.So, checking in was a breeze -- huge, open air lobby with plenty of check-in stations and wonderful local girl (sorry, don't remember her name) helping us. The friend I was staying with is a Hilton Gold, so I made a big deal of that to the agent -- to be sure we got a good room as this was also my first trip to HNL. And we did.My friend went to park the car and I went to our room on the 34th floor of the 35 floor of the Tapa tower. The room was made up, but the previous guest's bill was still on the floor on the other side of the door when I walked in... The room smelled like stale cigarette smoke...but I opened the lania door and got a load of that incredible view Diamond Head and the ocean (odd numbered rooms face Diamond Head), and well, I still felt it necessary to call and see if any other room, as nice, was available as both of us are non-smokers. I had also noticed that there were cigarette ashes on the table by the chair by the lanai door -- it appeared that the table had not been wiped off, even. In the meantime, the bellman brings our luggage, while I'm on the phone getting another room and we get switched to 1 floor below, same side of the building. Well, that room stunk like smoke, too. And it just didn't seem as nice, so we moved back up to the original room. They were supposed to send house-keeping up to clean off the table and spray some air freshener -- that never happened. In fact, we were there 4 nights and that table never got wiped clean the entire time we were there. ALL hotel rooms in Honolulu/Waikiki are supposed to be non-smoking, now -- but is that possible with all the guests that still do smoke? Especially tourists -- I mean, how can the HHV, seriously control whether or not someone smokes in one of their 2860 rooms? They certainly do not make you sign a waiver when you check in that says if you do, you have to pay $100 for the fumigation, or anything like that -- that many hotels do these days, at least on the mainland.Should of checked before bedtime (very, very late) -- but the sheets and bed linens reeked of smoke too. We were both too tired to do anything about it and made do. Keep in mind that these are Hilton heavenly beds (I think that's what they call them) and they use down comforters in white, high thread-count duvets. With the window open, and temps dropping down into the mid-60's, I found it much, much too hot to sleep under the thick duvet. And there is no top sheet to slip under. I used my sarong as a sheet and we turned the air on high and cold the next 3 nights. With the window open, there was a lot of noise from below, too. All was acceptable except for the back-up beeep, beeep, beeep of delivery vehicles or ???? I began using ear plugs on nights like these several trips ago and found them to be of great use, again, in this case. Also, the air-conditioning, when on high, was quite noisy and the ear-plugs came in handy (best, most comfortable, in my opinion, are the orange foam ones made by 3M, model 1100. Cheap, too)Next morning, we made sure to have house-keeping change the bed linens -- AHHH, wonderfully fresh that next night...So, as Hilton gold and guest, we received free continental breakfast each morning, too, available at 3 restaurants -- Tapa cafe, Tropic beach cafe, or Rainbow lanai. My friend enjoyed her very, very early breakfasts at the Tapa cafe, while I did 2 days at the Tropics beach cafe and found it to be quite nice -- styrofoam coffee cups that you can refill on your way out and take a coffee to go at no extra charge was a real plus! Food was typical cold buffet -- rolls, toast, bagels, cereal, milk, juice, yogurt, fresh fruit. All was fresh and very good. By the 3rd morning, I wanted eggs, though, and had heard we could upgrade to the hot buffet at the Rainbow lanai for $5. Wonderful! Made to order omelets, pancakes with coconut syrup, meats, etc, etc, etc, as well as all the cold choices and more. Although, I thought the fresh pineapple slices at the Rainbow lania weren't as fresh at the tropics cafe. Both of us had breakfast there on our last day, along with several other of her conference attendees. Come to find out, the hot buffet went for more than $20 a person and the cold was about $13 (or more?) per person. Wow. If I was paying for it, I would not have been eating there...Did not have any other meals or drinks at the HHV. They have an ABC store right on premises (rainbow shops area) and the Whaler's cove general store on the side by the Al'ili tower and Diamond head towers is an ABC in disguise, with all the same prices and much of the same stuff.Pools were gorgeous -- the pool near the Tapa tower, while kind of exposed to all passers by, was actually more calm and quiet than the great pool where there were a lot of children. Although there was no jacuzzi/hot tub anywhere we could find... We heard the Kalia tower pool has a jacuzzi/hot tub -- but you had to be using the over-priced Madera spa in order to use it.I say overpriced Madera spa because a 50 minute massage is advertised at $135 -- but that's not including the 4% tax and 18% sur charge, which is supposed to include the gratuity and brings the total to $164.70. I have yet to meet ANY masseuse worth that price. Happily, we discoverd the Hale Koa hotel, right next door. This is a military hotel; you must be active or retired U.S. military to stay there. But, you can call them and book a massage with them -- you do not have to be military! All they had available was 30 minutes -- for $35 -- in a cabana by the pool. My only complaint was that it was not long enough! If I had known sooner, I would've booked an hour for $65 or 90-minutes -- yes, 90 blissful minutes -- for $85! Ok, so I didn't get a fancy robe and slippers, but the young lady concentrated on my back, neck, and shoulders -- just as I had asked -- and I walked out of there feeling wonderful and well, smug, having saved myself at least $100 compared to the HHV prices! Can't say if the HHV nickle and dimed us for anything -- we did not use the coffee maker or drink anything, not even the bottled water, in the room. Finding out that we had gotten a special rate of $149 a night, and both of us had free breakfasts -- despite all the problems with the smoke-smelling room(s) -- I have to admit it was a pretty good deal for Waikiki. The HHV beach location is wonderful, and while it is at the end of the beach, nothing is too far of a walk. The public bus is only $2 if your feet do get tired, and believe it or not, we found taxis to be quite the bargain, actually - quicker than the bus and only $3-5 each, for 2, depending on where you're going along Waikiki beach area...Would I stay at the HHV again? Maybe. I would be more assertive if I got a wonderful room and had the smokey problem again, however. And, I have to be honest with my readers -- if you're still with me this far. Honolulu/Waikiki is not my style of vacation. So my attitude towards the Hilton Hawaiian Village is probably going to reflect that a bit. It's a huge resort, in a big town (kind of like a Las Vegas with a beach). For the right price, if this is your style of vacation -- huge resort, lots of restaurants to choose from, multiple pools and things for the kids to do, shops, and more shops -- the HHV is probably going to be great for you. If you're looking for peace, quiet, relaxation, lounging, privacy -- you should probably look elsewhere. You can see from my other reviews that I much prefer Kauai, and even Maui, over Honolulu. But, that is not the fault of the HHV. P.S. You can also use the Hale Koa bar -- it's down by the beach and pool, there. Their drinks are less expensive, they don't skimp on the pours, and they make a mighty fine Mai Tai!

<Content>Herding Cattle Its Big, ill give it that. There is lots to do in 'the village', plenty of restaurants, pools, wildlife and a pretty good gym. Its just that it feels as if you are part of a herd of cattle heading for the slaughter house. The service is terrible, the pace is fast and no-one really cares. The rooms are small and furnishings dated. I wouldn't go back and if you are looking for something a little more personal then spend a bit more and go somewhere else.

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian Village tips--- The Hilton Hawaiian Village is absolutely wonderful as many others have described. The grounds are well manicured and the bedding is to die for. HOWEVER, the construction noise on the north side of the Rainbow Tower makes these rooms unusable during daylight hours. I found this out the next day after a long flight from Atlanta when I returned to the room to take a nap and heard the constant beeping of trucks backing up and the constant pounding of a pile driver. The construction is to be completed in late 2007. Since we were staying four nights, I asked to be moved and was accomodated (Thanks to the management of the Hotel--they moved us, even though the Hotel was near capacity---) The room we received is in the TAPA tower on the 32nd floor. Looking out our patio doors is a framed view of Diamond Head!! Also, upon check in, I asked for the Paradise Pass which is available at a nominal charge. It gives you unlimited internet use as well as access to the workout facility....

<Content>Simply the best We spent a week at the HHW in October 06. I had stayed next door at the Ilikai many times before so I had a good idea about the Hilton before going. Everything about our stay was fantastic!Our children ( 4 and 8 ) absolutely loved it and talk about it often.The room, pools, service, meals - everything was first class. It may be a few years before we go again but we definately would not stay anywhere else.

<Content>Amazing Hotel, Amazing Vacation! My family and I take vacations every summer to a different locale and in the summer of 2006 (due to my mom's constant persistence) we stayed on Waikiki Beach at the Hilton Hawaiian Village - AMAZING resort. I have to say I have never been sadder to leave a hotel in my life! EVERYTHING about it was spectacular! To begin with the view from our room in the Rainbow Tower was breathtaking! Waking up in the mornings and seeing the beach as well as Diamond Head volcano was great. The rooms were very spacious, comfortable, and nicely decorated with everything we needed. The service at the resort was very impressive. Traveling to many different places you are forced to interact with others and at times the people that help you are just so rude - but this was the complete opposite. It seems that they would go out of their way whenever it came to anything we needed.The staff members at the restaurants, bars, and shops were extremely friendly and helpful. Even the girl working in the concierge (which gives the most amazing recommendations for restaurants - definitely encourage you to eat out on the town). Dining at the Hilton Hawaiian Village is an experience unto itself - with its extensive variety of places to pick - you never have to repeat a restaurant!When we weren鈥檛 driving around the island to see and experience the beauty Oahu had to offer, we were able to enjoy our days relaxing by the enormous hotel pool or by the sparkling Waikiki beach. I truly have to say this is one of the best vacations I have ever taken 鈥?and I definitely recommend the Hilton Hawaiian Village to EVERYONE!

<Content>Wonderful! Excellent hotel on the best part of waikiki beach! When we walked along waikiki beach we couldnt believe how narrow the beach was on some parts. The Hilton is definately on the best stretch. The grounds were amazing and you have every amenity within a few steps. Loved the penguins and flamingos on the ground. The wedding chapel is stunning. The nicest hotel on all of waikiki! We definately will stay there again and again!!!

<Content>Amazing! This was the first place we stayed on our 3 week trip to the tropical islands. We went directly from the airport to the Hilton and boy was it a spot. It really makes you feel like you're in the south. To go to the check-ins you don't go inside, there are no walls on the groud level except for the changing rooms and one of the restaurants. The beach was incredible, the far end of Waikiki. I didn't want to leave after only one night!

<Content>Loved it Booked a two night stay in a standard village view room, and was upgraded to Executive room on the 24th floor in the Kalia Tower.The room was great, spacious and spotlessly clean and the bed, as usual was fantastic. Great view of the mountains and city and part of the ocean. The free breakfast, snacks etc were an added extra, very tasty pastries and evening hors d'oeuvres. Check in staff were very friendly. For us the village had a great atmosphere, it is huge and granted many of the shops were expensive, but hey, don't shop there. We found the restauarnts and bars quite reasonable, compared wit hte rest of fine dining in Hawaii. Only gripe was the plastic cups they serve the cocktails in late at night (don't know if this is normal).The hotel is in about the quietest part of Waikiki we saw, walking distance to the main beach ( the walk along the beach or through the park is lovely) and Ala Moana Shopping Centre. Didn't have any problem with the traffic noise, but we were on a high floor.Cannot wait to stay here again.

<Content>High Rise High Traffic Paradise This is an excellent place to stay, relax and enjoy Wikiki Beach. Nice Rooms with great views. You and about 10,000 people will enjoy this well laid out resort. The prices are step for everything, expect it. Just relax, take a surf lesson or snorkel in front of the hotel, take in some live music or wander down the beach. A 3-4 day stay is just perfect. Don't miss Paradise Cove Lau. Just hang loose when you go to the local restraunts, the service takes forever.

<Content>Too big city This was our fourth trip to Hawaii, but our first on Oahu. The Hawaiian Village is a beautiful hotel, first-rate service and amenities. We were upgraded to an ocean view room--one of the things we really look forward to is leaving the sliding doors open and listening to the ocean. Unfortunately, all we heard was traffic noise 24/7--the hotel is located on Waikiki Beach, but also adjacent to a VERY busy highway. We're from Chicago, and this was reminiscent of living next to an expressway. We were booked for 6 nights, and ready to leave after 4. Again, the accommodations were first-class, but the traffic noise killed it for us.

<Content>hilton hawaiian village overrated Hilton Hawaiian Village is a nice property, however it has to be one of the most expensive places to eat in Hawaii. Rooms are decent, small closets, but clean. Property is beautiful, but retaurants are sky high, even the cheap ones. (food was terrible)Not worth staying there while you can get just as nice a hotel at a more reasonable rate with great reasonably priced restaurants. Smokers beware, HHV is pretty much a non-smoking facility. If you smoke, you may as well have leporacy. There are two ash trays on the entire property, located in designated hidden areas that make you feel like a criminal if you lite up. Pools are nice, but beach is a bit of a walk. I would NOT recommend this hotel.

<Content>Avoid This Property We spent two night at this property, having just stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki and the Marriott Waikiki. We were booked into the Kalia tower, one of six on the property, and situated near the entrance. Our room was on an 'executive' floor, with special key access, and complimentary continental breakfast, and light snacks at noon and early evening. We had a full ocean view but this was compromised by construction cranes. We found the staff somewhat remote and occasionally deficient in English, perhaps because of the predominance of Japanese tourists. The one restaurant we sampled - Sergio's- was excellent. We had booked their pacific rim restaurant 'Bali by the Sea' but canceled after finding difficulty finding a published menu with prices. Once we finally located one - at the restaurant after asking the hostess - we understood why.The property is at the extreme West end of Waikiki, some distance from the heart of the action. One can easily feel a prisoner in this complex. It's designed to keep you there. The sheer volume of guests here, when spilling out of the many high rise towers, can be disconcerting. I can't think of a good reason to stay here. It's too far for many to walk to the Ala Moana shopping centre, and it's a fair walk to mid Waikiki as well. It's pricey, crowded, and fairly noisy.

<Content>Construction near Lagoon Tower HGVC Hilton Hawaiian Village After spending a week in Kaua'i, my husband and I spent three nights here before heading back to the mainland. As HGVC owners, we actually do this every year to break up our vacation a little and visit Waikiki which has great food and shopping, not something that is readily available on the island of Kaua'i. Don't get me wrong, we love Kaua'i, but it is a different vacation experience than the big city bustle of Waikiki. Sometimes you need a little of both!As HGVC owners (Vegas) we booked into the Lagoon Tower, which as the name implies is right next to the lagoon. What we didn't know is that the lagoon is gone and in it's place is a big construction pit where they are building the new Grand Waikikian Tower, which I think is another HGVC building. Overall the construction isn't bad, it does however create quite an inconvenience if you are not expecting it. Having been there many times before, we arrived on the property in our rental car and proceeded to the Lagoon Tower driveway only to discover it was barricaded because of construction. The parking garage entrance was also inaccessible because it was being used as an exit only, and I think it was the end of a shift because there was a constant stream of cars coming out and they weren't rental cars. On a Hawaiian vacation you should always be relaxed and patient, which I usually am, but for some reason I became really agitated by this situation. I was trapped in a dead-end with no way to turn around because the people coming out of the garage were not about to stop and give me room to turn around. Add to that a really annoying taxi driver who pulled up behind me and refused to back up so I could at least reverse myself out of the dead-end. After what seemed like 10 minutes and alot of screaming on my part he finally moved and I was able to back up. I have two gripes about this. First, couldn't the Hilton have told us in advance that there was construction and the main entrance to the Lagoon Tower was closed? Had we known, we wouldn't have attempted to drive there. Second, there were guards directing traffic and when I made my move to head to the Lagoon Tower, the guard that was standing right there (on the corner near Lapperts for those of you who have been there) could have told me it was closed. You can't see it is closed until you round the corner and by then it's too late to turn around. Other than that, the rest of the vacation was great. If you are another HGVC owner and contemplating a visit here I would recommend booking the Kalia Tower instead. There is nothing wrong with the Lagoon Tower, it's the inconvenience of the construction that will keep me from booking in this tower until construction is completed.The pool at the Lagoon Tower is also closed so you have to use the Super Pool, the Tapa Pool or the Kalia Pool. I recommend the Kalia Pool. There aren't many people who use this pool and if you want to relax, it's generally kid free. That said, kids are allowed, but for the most part they prefer the Super Pool. The other important thing to note is that the parking garage has an entrance near the Kalia Tower as well. For all the years we have stayed here I didn't know this until I was forced to use that entrance due to the closure of the entrance by the Lagoon Tower.

<Content>Love it! I have stayed in several different hotels along Waikiki beach. The Hilton Hawaiian Village is definitely my favorite! Outstanding service, great beach area, clean rooms, beautiful lobby and lounge, great pool, wonderful hula show, beautiful views! There is a great Asian-themed shopping courtyard directly across the street with cute shops. Also, great high-class shopping on hotel grounds. Beautiful landscaping and wonderfully done animal exhibits also on hotel grounds. Absolutely outstanding!

<Content>Enjoyable Stay at Hilton Hawaiian Village We stayed Dec 19 and 20th in the Ali'i Tower. Note: this is a peak travel time in Hawaii. The room was spacious and the staff very attentive. I selected tower because I wanted access to the private pool and the evening appetizers. The pool was nice and I did not have a problem getting 4 lounge chairs so we could sit together. The complimentary appetizers worked out great and served as our dinner. Fruit, cheese, veggies, spring rolls, wontons. This tower is right on the beach. Perfect!On Dec 26-28 we stayed in the Kahlia tower. We were upgraded to an oceanview room. I would recommend this tower as well since it has a private pool. The soothing aroma from the spa permiated in the pool area. Tropics Bar (Ali'i Tower) offered a great view but had mostly fried food which I am not a fan of. Lappert's Ice Cream was a treat for the kids. I would recommend Benihana's at lunch time. The kid enjoyed watching the entertaining hibachi chef. Teriaki Chicken at Hanajuban was good for only $8. Overall the food was just ok at this resort. If you have kids you should take a walk to some neighboring restaurants to cut down on cost. The evening entertainment by the super pool of polynesian dancers was great. The kids begged to see it each night. I would recommend this resort.

<Content>Yuk. The main disappointment was the customer service - after arriving in the wee hours of the morning after long flight delays it was very unpleasant to wait on a line (at 3AM!) to check in with the sole counter person - she was inept and spoke poor English at a whisper... we weren't shown or even pointed to our room, and finally got a lounging van driver to point us in the right direction.This continued throughout our stay, staff were obviously bored, resentful or just dying to get off work, we were made to feel like intruders rather than guests. Another annoyance - petty charges for everything from coffee packets in the room ($3!) to beach chair rental ($12). Just up the room charges and skip this nickle and dime stuff, huh?The hotel itself is just one spending opportunity - the village is just shops.The room was fine - spacious and clean - but our high floor looked over the truck and bus loading dock and the backing up beeping of both was very annoying and lasted all night and day. Disappointing in general.

<Content>Dissapointing for a Hilton! We stayed here November 2006, just before thanksgiving. During this time, the hotel is not crowded. ROOMS:The rooms are good size, larger than general hotel rooms and if you happen to have a room in the Rainbow Tower, at the very end facing the sea, they are absolutely amazing! Of all the rooms I have had in any hotel, I think I will always remember the view from these rooms 鈥?we had two. The higher, the better.FOOD:This hotel has very low quality food, for a Hilton, it surprised us. We tried various restaurants in the hotel, yet the food as always old, aged, not tasty and expensive for what鈥檚 offered. And do not, DO NOT eat at the restaurant next to the water way with ducks and fish in it, because you will loose your appetite due to the smell of the duck droppings and fish in the water.GROUNDS:The grounds of the hotel need dusting off! Everything looked like they were covered with dust, just not a clean feeling. Although the hotel has a superb location and is a huge complex with potential, it is not maintained well.CONCLUSION:We would not stay here again, mostly because the food is BAD! But if you are not worried about quality of food, then this is a good hotel. Not very good, not bad, just average 鈥?not worth more than 200 dollars per night.

<Content>Ahhhh.... We stayed at this hotel a few years ago when my husband was running the Honolulu marathon and it was spectacular! The room itself was decorated in typical Hawaiian decor and was nice enough (not luxurious but comfortable and pleasant) but....the view from our balcony was incredible and made our stay. We looked out on to the ocean and could hear the waves when we slept. We stayed there in early December and being there early in the holiday season was such a different and fun experience. The hotel had carolers in the lobby and Santa made a few appearances in Bermuda shorts.The pool was nice and fairly large and very easy access to the beach.It was a bit of a walk to get to the shops and main part of Honolulu but it was worth it to stay at the hotel.

<Content>Beautiful complex, still a work in progress We booked through a travel wholesaler (Gogo Tours) for multiple islands. This was our first stop on a three island tour, December 6-8. We arrived about 6:30 PM local time; this is a HUGE complex and it took us a few minutes to locate the check-in desk. We were told there were no king beds available, so they upgraded us to an ocean view with double beds. Our room in the Tapa tower (29th floor) did have an ocean view, but it's in the back of the complex and faces Diamond Head (east). Our room keys didn't open our door due to a fussy electronic lock; a second set provided by the front desk didn't work any better. Security was dispatched promptly and they got us in with our keys; they had another set made in the keymaster's office to appease us.The room was spacious and included a wet bar. We had several issues; a noisy air handler was corrected, but a cordless phone with no dial tone and roaches in the sinks were not. Hot water in the shower was difficult to regulate.This is a nice resort, but has very expensive shops and restaurants. You can have a very nice stay in Waikiki and spend a lot less money at other properties in the area.

<Content>Great village away from it all! I stayed at the Hilton before participating in the Marathon. I must say, the room was very nice and comfortable. Balcony was great , but overlooked construction with alot of noise. This noise was muted once we closed the sliding door. The pool area was fantastic! Very tropical with pleasant cocktail servers, who served the best Mai Tais ever! Beach access and shopping was above par!! On a sour note: At the Hilton Village, you are nickled and dimed for absolutely everything!!! There's a charge for the safe, for the internet, for more than one small packet of coffee, on and on....I would stay here again as it was very relaxing!!!

<Content>Loved the Lagoon Tower This Hotel is beautiful. The service was great. We stayed at the Lagoon Tower and our view was spectacular. We look at our pictures and we still can't believe the view was real. The rooms were big and clean. The service was great. The property is the best that I have seen. There is so much to do that you really do not need to leave the property. This is my 4th time to Hawaii and this was definatley the best hotel in Waikiki.

<Content>Loved HHV! We stayed at the HHV from 12/14 - 12/17, in the Ali'i Tower. I gotta say that we were a wee bit leary of the place after some of the reviews but we love this place! Our room is big and clean, the staff is excellent and always very helpful. It wasn't very crowded during our stay, we were always able to find pool chairs and we didn't go down there until 3-4 in the afternoon. We watched the fireworks from the Ali'i pool/jacuzzi. Overall this is a great hotel. The price was comparable to other places we stay on vacation. We will definitely be coming back to this hotel.

<Content>Overall a very nice hotel in Waikiki My wife and I (she's 30, I'm 33) stayed at the Hilton Hawaiin Village Dec 7-13. Overall, we had a great stay and were pleased with the hotel. Here are our thoughts on the hotel: ROOM - We had a room in the Tapa tower. We were originally booked in the Kalia tower, but were upgraded to a partial oceanview room in Tapa. (Apparently upgrades are pretty common. Ask for one!) The room was clean and well-appointed, with a safe ($3.50/day to use), mini refigerator, iron, TV and mini-bar. Some have complained that the coffee, bottled water and other in-room beverages are too expensive. And that's true. But no problem...just go to one of the many ABC stores (sort of like a 7-11) in and around the hotel and stock up on these items there. The bed was plenty comfortable. The TV had standard cable, although we didn't watch it much. We did rent an on-demand movie one night ($9.99), which was nice. I also tried the high speed in-room Internet service on the TV ($10.99 for a couple hours). My advice? Skip it. It is slow and doesn't work well. It is set up for mobile (as in PDA) Internet viewing, so many websites flat-out don't load or are hard to read. If you really need Internet access, bring a laptop or go to an Internet cafe. Two small room complaints: one day, the shower water was only lukewarm all day long. Not a big deal though...it was fine the rest of the time. Also, the room doors slam if allowed to. Other guests apparently felt it was no problem to let their doors slam at 2:00 AM, which was annoying. But all in all, the rooms were nice.FOOD - The hotel has about 15-20 eateries, ranging from very reasonable to very expensive. We went to one of the very expensive restaurants (Bali by the Sea) one night and had a delicious meal. As others have noted, it is fun to have one nice (i.e. expensive) dinner at the hotel just for the experience, but no more than that. Within the hotel we also ate at Round Table (pizza), CJ's (New York style deli) and a Japanese noodle place. All of the meals were good, although nothing spectacular. You'll probably want to eat most of your meals out on the town, where there is more variety both in terms of price and cuisine. But for a single hotel, there ARE a lot of dining options here. Also as noted on this board, there is a 24/7 coffee shop across the street (sort of like a Denny's) that is a great option, especially for families. Oh, while in Hawaii, eat the local fresh fruit! Fresh pineapple and guava just tastes better in Hawaii!HOTEL GROUNDS - As noted already, this place is huge. Still, I don't really understand negative comments regarding crowds, as if those reviewers were surprised that a resort with 3,000 rooms might feel crowded at times. In truth, the entirety of Waikiki feels crowded. If you want seclusion, you're on the wrong island to begin with. But aside from the hotel ABC store and certain eateries, the hotel crowds really aren't that bad. The grounds are beautiful, clean and well-maintained, with small waterfalls and certain wildlife roaming around (never saw the penguins though). We had been warned of construction before our arrival, but in the Tapa Tower at least, we didn't even notice it. The Super Pool is kind of lame, as it isn't very super. (The pool at the military-only Hale Koa hotel is much nicer). But, the pool also wasn't as crowded as I expected. And yes, people do reserve pool seats by putting a towel over one of the lounge chairs, even though in my observation these people often never showed up. In my opinion the hotel should prohibit reserving pool seats. If you want a chair by the pool, then go sit in one! It is rude and obnoxious to reserve a seat you aren't using and apparently may not intend to use. Overall, the grounds are very nice!STAFF - The hotel staff were always helpful and pleasant. They were eager to assist anytime you had a problem or question, or needed a recommedation. We left a $3 tip for the cleaning staff each day (rule of thumb is $1/person per room, so we tipped a bit more). It has been my experience worldwide that if you tip the cleaning staff, your room WILL be cleaned better. Just human nature, I suppose.MISCELLANEOUS - Overall this is a very nice hotel, and I would stay here again. Families, active couples and groups of friends would have a good time here. Those wanting seclusion or who want to avoid people should not stay here. The hotel will help book recreation activities, but you should price shop around. In particular, get a Oahu Gold or similar book (found on most street corners in news racks) and use the coupons for the best deals. If you go to the hotel Welcome Center for your free gift after checking in, know that they will try to get you to attend a 90 minute timeshare presentation. But they aren't too pushy about it. Just decline and get your free gift (A luggage tag in our case, although they do have some nice gifts you can win.) Parking at the hotel is pricey...$3.50 an hour or $20/day. But that is standard Waikiki. If you have a late flight out of Hawaii, you can book a hotel hospitality room for free, for 45 minutes. This allows you to freshen up before your flight if you've been out and about all day.  I should say, this was my second visit to Oahu. Last time, I stayed at the Hale Koa (a military only resort), so that is the reference I have with which to compare hotels. While the Hale Koa is almost as nice as the Hilton, and is only about 1/3 the price of the Hilton, it isn't really a fair comparison since you have to be in the military to stay at the Hale Koa. If I was still in the military I would choose the Hale Koa over the Hilton based on price alone, but like I said...it isn't a fair comparison.If you have questions about the Hilton Hawaiian Vilage, email me and I will be happy to provide an honest, objective answer.Aloha!!!

<Content>great place great deal My boss and I went to Oahu for a business trip from 2 Dec thru 06 Dec. I booked my tickets with our military travel office so we got a sweet deal, $149.00 a night to stay at the Hilton Hawaiin Village.This hotel has everything you would expect for a 5 start hotel. There are extra prices to park etc but you get that at these types of places. Nothing crazy though.The rooms were amazing. I stayed in the Tapa tower and loved it. My room was upgarded on check in to a partial ocean view which was great. The only complaint I had was the walls are a little thin. When guests pass by the room, they can be heard. This however was no great concern since it only happened a few times. I'd do it again

<Content>Much better than expected My family and I just spent a week at the HHV over Thanksgiving. Going in we did not have huge expectations from such a mega complex but surprisingly our expectations were greatly exceeded.We stayed in the Ali'i Tower which is more pricy but with its own private pool and free light hors d'oeuvers. Nothing incredible but a nice snack for the kids after a day in the sun.The pools are quite small for a resort this size and a little boring for older kids, at the Super Pool lounge chairs are lined up for right when the pool opens. No sich trouble with chairs at the Ali's pool and it is adjacent to a nice small work out room.It is not the cheapest resort around, but compared to other areas of Hawaii quie an overall bargain. The food on site is nothing remarkable and avoid The Golden Dragon at all cost. Food is mediocre and service horrible. Nice spot for breakfast is the 24 hour diner across the street.Great location with many shops and restaurants within easy walking distance.Overall an excellent experience.

<Content>This hotel was excellent My wife and i recently spent 1 night of our honeymoon at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The hotel was more like a resort. It had everything....shops, restaurant, a large pool and easy access to the beach. There are multiple towers. We stayed in an oceanview room in the rainbow tower. The view was spectacular. Try to get a room on the corner if you can overlooking the ocean and the bay. The room itself was spacious, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was emaculateSince we were only there 1 night, it's hard to say much else about this place. But believe me, you can go wrong with this place. Our only concern was that the majority of the restaurants, shops and nightlife outside of the Hilton Hawaiian village were 2 miles further west of this hotel, which meant taxi rides to and from the restaurant row area. All of the restaurants are expensive, so we enjoyed being able to price compare a little in menus and prices.Also, this hotel is doing a bit of construction on a lagoon next to the rainbow tower. So you may hear noise if you're on one of the lower floors, but of course most of the work is done by 4pm when everyone is on the beach.As a money saving tip, I would also suggest going to the local ABC stores (they are small conveience stores in the hotel and literally on every block in Waikiki) and buying simple things like water, crackers, chips, etc and eating that for lunch. Trust me, we did this and saved a lot.The streets of Waikiki are always busy, especially at night.Take a couple of the tours and learn about Hawaiian culture. We did the Polynesian Culture tour which was all day (leave at 12 noon and get back about 10pm) and we did a luau and saw a Polynesian dance show. We also did a short 3 hr tour where we hiked thru a rain forest (yes there are rain forests in Hawaii).Enjoy!

<Content>Huge hotel, but with benefits. It's advertised that there are ~3000 rooms, so it's not the most personal place, BUT, it really is a village! There are shops, restaurants, a beach, 3 swimming pools, grocery store and car rental and travel agencies and more located within the hotel grounds. The village is on the very west end of Waikiki, so you do have to walk awhile to get to the center of the beachy strip and to the main downtown area, but the good news is that the Hilton sits on the beach. It was always busy there, with plenty of screaming children and not much privacy on the beach, at the pools, or at meals. If you want a boutique hotel, or a romantic getaway, this isn't for you, but probably a good choice for families. A cab is about $30 from the airport.

<Content>Great Family Vacation We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Nov. 5-11. We had booked two rooms in the Kalia tower, mountain view. When we checked in we had been upgraded to ocean view. The rooms were very nice and the furnishings were what I would expect. The rooms were clean and we received excellent maid service during our stay.The location is excellent as you are on the quiet end of Waikiki. We were within walking distance of Ala Moana mall. We didn鈥檛 use the pools much but our children loved playing in the ocean every day. I have to agree with others who say that Hilton is being overly aggressive by charging for beach chairs and umbrellas. This is something that should be free. To avoid paying their high fees, we just bought our own beach chairs at Costco on the first day to use throughout our stay.We only ate one meal at the Hilton and I found it to be sub-par. However, there are plenty of dining options in Waikiki.Many have mentioned that they found the Hilton and Waikiki too crowded. I say that Waikiki is what it is. If you are looking for quiet and uncrowded, pick somewhere else. All things considered, the Hilton is the best place to stay in Waikiki.

<Content>Holiday of a lifetime Me and my husband stayed at this hotel for 10 days on our honeymoon. We did have some problems when we were checking in as there was a room mix up, but the staff did everything they good to make us happy. They finally put us in a room and they had sent us complimentary chanpagne, which was great! The hotel room was very, very clean and as we were there for 10 days, the cleaners did a great job with keeping the rooms clean.The hotel is a little village which is one of the things that we loved so much, we could walk to the beach from our room. There is also an ABC store at the bottom of our tower, which was so convenient and cheap. You can find one of those stores at a few places when you are walking around.I do reccomend the ice cream, it's pricey but probably the best ice cream we have ever tasted!!!!!We had a great breakfast every morning at one of the restaurants in the resort and they have a veriety of different things. The staff there were very friendly and always greeted us by our names every morning.They also have pengiuns and parrots in the hotel resort, which i have never seen before. The fireworks on the Friday night before we went home were amazing - we just sat on the beach and watched the sky. It wasn't busy at all, it was just right.Overall this hotel really made our Honeymoon so great, the service was great and the staff were too. We definatly will go back... maybe for our 25th Wedding Anniversary!!!!!!!!

<Content>Unimpressed with the room and service We're staying in the Tapa tower, in a Partial Ocean View room (which, by the way, means that if we go out to the lanai, we can look over and see the ocean). I would not stay here again at this rate ($205, which was a conference rate).The room is okay -- the furniture is worn (paint chipping off the desk, saggy chair cushions, etc.). The carpet and bedding are clean. The air conditioner is noisy. Places like hallways and elevators could be better maintained (peeling wallpaper, chipped paint, etc.). There's a big construction project going on, so I'd agree with the previous suggestion to request a room on the Diamond Head side. The service has been quite lackluster -- of the polite but not my problem variety. I really didn't care about the room view, but I specifically called the hotel a few days before our arrival to request a room away from the street and any construction. Was told no problem, but what we got was a direct view of a crane, overlooking a construction zone, as close to the street as you can get. I spent our entire first afternoon trying politely to get our room changed but didn't even get an acknowledgement that my request had not been fulfilled. We waited a few hours with the hopes that a room that was being cleaned would improve the situation, only to find that the room smelled awful. I was willing to pay a higher room rate, and apparently even then there was nothing else available. (Their web site was still accepting reservations for the various room categories, though.) Ditto the previous comments about being nickled and dimed... Internet access is now 12.95/day, it's not wireless, and it's slow.

<Content>Loved it. My god this hotel is huge! We got lost trying to find check in! We were dropped off round the back so had to walk through all the boutique shops etc. Anyway check in was fine, they upgraded us as we were on honeymoon. We stayed in the Ali tower which was lovely, you get free nibbles round the pool each night from 5 till 8 I loved it (mind you the drinks are quite expensive! so maybe opt for water!) You also get free water through out the day to drink whilst you sunbath round the pool which I thought was fantastic as it does get very hot! The Polynesian show each night is also fun which is situated out by the main pool, for everyone to see, no matter which tower they are in. The fireworks on a Friday night are brilliant too. So your right on the beach, it wasn鈥檛 crowded when we were there Oct 9th till 15th. You also have shops in the hotel complex, so you can buy milk and drinks etc and keep them in your room fridge. We also experienced the earth quake on our last morning there. I have to say the staff were very helpful as we were un sure wether to leave for the airport or not, they called on our behalf to find out etc. Also called our airline so they were great. I would definitely stay here again, it鈥檚 a lovely hotel.

<Content>Don't go if you want restful surroundings We stayed for 1 week in June 2006, the hotel was unbelievably crowded. When they say village in the title they mean it, the rooms are spread across 4 buildings and there are lots of little shops and restaurants, tending to be upscale, one including Louis Vuitton which was bizarre, because this is not a high class resort. On checking in we were told only one room was available, although we had a reservation with Virgin holidays. The room was on the top floor of Rainbow tower, 46th floor or similar, which was a no go since I am scared of heights. We were then switched to another room with balcony, 3rd floor, view of nothing. The room was clean, but that was about it. The hotel was packed with kids and families, there is a tiny swimming pool which you have to queue by 8.30am to get a sun lounger at, otherwise the Japanese tourists descend. Waikiki beach is overrated, there are much better beaches in Florida and Caribbean. It cost 拢30 to hire an umberella and 2 sun loungers which was ridiculous.Restaurants in the hotel were overpriced, our saving grace was a Ward Centers mall nearby which had a large selection of restaurants at reasonable prices. They also have a large cinema there.In summary, I think Hilton need to look seriously at what its trying to offer with this hotel -family resort or luxury resort, because at the moment its not satisfying the criteria of either.

<Content>Like being in a crowded town When we went there it was the Labor day weekend and the place was full and the room we had asked for was not available so they bumped us up to a time share which was great. Negatives:FYI: Garden view is classified as anything but ocean view. you could be overlooking a construction site next door.The parking in the hotel was steep. $10 per day. Every thing here is expensive.After having stayed in Maui this place felt like a crowded city. Overall our experience here was average. If you are looking for a quiet peaceful vacation this is not the place.

<Content>Very nice We checked in 15 Sunday and of course that is the day of the quake. The lines were long trying to check in but all in all is wasn't bad. The place is very nice and well maintained you saw people all over the place cleaning. We stayed in the Tapa Towers the room was nice are veiw was not bad. We were told that some rooms were being remodeled. The room we had was on the 15th floor but not sure if it was one that already had or not. We ate at Bali by the Sea and at the Golden Dragon food was good but the price was high. Would stay here again but would stay in the Ali' Tower. Being a resort I thought that it would be more private than it was not sure how big it will be when they finish but what they have now is ver y nice. The one thing that I had read about was the supper pool I didn't think that it was that big. One thing i think the could change is having a gym in all the towers and wireless in all rooms for free.

<Content>Very Crowded We stayed at the Hawaiian Village for one night during a long stay in Hawaii. We usually avoid Waikiki while we're in Oahu but we had a free night at the Hilton and couldn't pass it up. The congestion in Waikiki is horrible. Traffic is slow and there are people everywhere. I pulled up to the registration desk to check in and was shooed away by a valet after I told him I was just checking in and would then self park. He said I needed to park first and then check in. The check in line was very long, but I was able to use the Hilton Honors express check in line which only had one person ahead of me. The other line seemed to move pretty quickly as the desk was fully staffed. I was upgraded to a suite in the Kapa tower and was very pleased with the room. Two balconies, a living/dining area and then a seperate bedroom with 1.5 baths and a wet bar with mini-fridge. It was a shame we only had the one night to spend there. Since we were flying out the following night, I called the front desk to request a hospitality room for that day. Check out time was 11 AM, but the hotel allows you to reserve a hospitality room at no fee for later in the day so you can freshen up before your flight. The room is a standard hotel room and you are given 20 minutes per person in your group for it. The room is fully stocked with towels and toiletries to allow you to shower and get ready for your flight. We also took advantage of the Hilton Check In computer kiosks in the lobby. Besides allowing you to check in or out of the hotel, they also allow you to check in for your flight and print boarding passes on most major airlines. We didn't have time to experience their pools, restaurant, or the beach. However we did stroll through the grounds a few times and everything was very crowded every time. The restaurants had lines, all the pool chairs were taken, and people were all over the hotel stores. As is true with most resorts, there are a lot of extra fees. Parking was about $12 per day and internet access was also available for a daily fee. Overall its a very nice resort with wonderful service. If you want to be in the middle of everything in Waikiki, the location is perfect. If you're looking to drive around the island and visit other parts, you'll be in for a headache with the traffic.

<Content>Might stay again-only because of the view. Aloha!Don't get me wrong-I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Only for the reasons that A)We know that it is clean  nice, etc.  B)The Rainbow Tower is directly on the beach.Was supposed to be upgraded to Deluxe Oceanfront Room for both us  our 26 year old daughter (2 rooms). Wasn't. They claimed it was. Both had views of the lagoon  Ala Wai Yacht Harbor. Still a great view, tho. Just disappointing. I have heard that you ask for 'Diamond Head side of the hotel'. I just forgot to do that when checking in. Lines are REALLY long when checking in, but, they have virgin Mai Tai's that are really tasty. Guess with all the kiddies, they can't give ya the good stuff! :-( We booked this thru a travel agent who in turn booked it thru Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays. Was not happy with them. Didn't get the things (trivial things-bags, etc) that were promised. We had to attend the orientation breakfast to get all our goodies. The travel agent neglected to tell me this. Also, didn't find out it was Pleasant Hawaiian til we got the tickets-3 WEEKS BEFORE WE LEFT!!!We did get the vouchers for $50 off at various HHV restaurants for each room. What they FORGOT to tell us is that it is for food only. No drinks. Soooo, we racked up the bill for the drinks  when we checked out, that was on our bill. I explained myself very tactfully  the guy went ahead  honored them! Our daughter had no problem because she used hers for our dinner at Bali By The Sea. That part went over well  I was happy with that part.Didn't need to go to the orientation breakfast because it cut into our time  we had already been to Oahu the year before for a month  knew everything already. Now, the hotel itself is just ok. Yes, it is a gorgeous facility  they are pretty good at upkeep on a daily basis. But, half the time we came back at the end of the day  they hadn't even gotten to ourrooms yet. It is such a big resort that it is hard to get that personal service.We have friends who own timeshares with HHV  we stayed with them for a few days during our month long stay 2 years ago. We knew it was a nice, clean resort  didn't need to look any further when booking a hotel when coming with our daughter. But, they are rather pricey. Flight, car  hotel for 8 nites was $2506 EACH!Our daughter gave us a budget for her for $2500. Whew! My husband had his heart set on this place because of the proximity to the beach  no obstructed views. But, the year before on our month long visit, my husband  I stayed in a condo on the North Shore that cost $100 per nite. So, it was a bit of a shock! But, we were in a prime location this time  as I said, I would stay there again. I would just book everything myself. I think it would have been a little cheaper that way.Oh! In one of the shops, my daughter went by herself (gotta get away from the parents a LITTLE!) to one by Bali By The Sea  she said one of the proprieters followed her around like a little lost puppy! So afraid she was going to 'lift' something!The shops are a little 'stuffy' when it comes to courtesy. The shops are great, tho  the restaurants are amazing! Especially Tropics Bar! GREAT drinks  food  right out there in the open air! So, as you can see, for the money, I don't think it is a great deal. But, if you want a sure thing in terms of cleanliness  all that-go for it! I would recommend this resort to anyone who asks. These are just my little 'annoyances'. Didn't affect my Hawaiian experience one little bit! There is no way anything can bother you for long in PARADISE!!!I just had a bit of a disappointing experience. Nothing major or devastating. Just my humble opinions. Not meant to offend.Mahalo!Aloha!

<Content>The Rainbow Tower was fabulous! After 11 hours of flight from Baltimore,MD... we were greeted with another two hour fight for our ocean-view accomodation we had paid for a year ago,through the Hilton Grand Vacation program. We stood our ground and ended up in the Rainbow Tower on the 26th floor with a fabulous view of the ocean, parts of Honolulu by night, and the mountain region. Even though it was a basic room, the scene from our balcony far outweighed the view of a building we had from the condo. Our room was beautiful, convenient, and surrounded by a truly tropical ambiance. A trip down the elevator and a walk of merely 40 steps placed us right on the beach..We loved our stay and truly felt like we were in paradise. We yearn to return.

<Content>Enormous hotel, too crowded The hotel is great, well appointed, beautiful, great location, good for families with young kids. But, it is enormous, the grounds are never ending, and the value for meals here is terrible. It is a great place to stay, but very impersonal; you can easily get lost from check in to getting to your room. The beach also can get crowded quickly and the pool as well.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We visited the Hilton in August for our honeymoon, this is a fantastic hotel. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower and the view of the beach was great. You did have to be careful about the water and coffee provided in the room as it was very expensive and the ABC store in the Hilton was also expensive. However Honolulu is full of ABC stores.We would definitely recomend this hotel, the pool is small but who needs the pool when the hotel is on the beach and the sea is so warm and clean.

<Content>Hotel Getting Away With This ! You are greeted with a pounding jackhammer that goes through the entire Tapa Tower for the duration of your stay.They dont warn you - when in fact they should not be open for business during such conditions. They of course take your money and leave you hanging. We had less than one hour to go before check out on our last day and the water was shut off ! and again they gave NO WARNING to anyone, no memo or signs, they dont think they need to let you know? We were this close to missing our flight, because of this-they made us run to another tower to shower-it was chaos. I wish I would have read trip advisors reviews before going there-as others had the exact same complaints! Never again!

<Content>Frustrating Service Just at the HHV with a group for last week of September. There were little problems throughout, (check-in dates, room switches for repairs). Most frustrating was the response time TO the problems. Every time a question came up, the first response from the hotel was There's nothing we can do. Only after getting face-to-face with people in authority were solutions arrived. Lower-level staff were deer in headlights.

<Content>Fantastic I wanted to write a review because the reviews had been really helpful to me and my trip. I loved this hotel. I stayed in the Tapa tower and my room was large and comfortable. The staff was very helpful when ever I needed assistance. The pools were fabulous and I enjoyed the King's Jubliee show that is every Friday night at the Super pool. When I return to Oahu I will be staying at the Hilton Hawaiin Village. I appreciated Expedia's help. Everything was taking care and there were no problems.Have a great time and Aloha!!!!

<Content>The Hilton Hawaiian Village lives up to it's name I stayed at the Hilton for 4 nights in mid September for a work conference at the nearby convention center. It truly is a village! I never did fully get my bearings and got turned around constantly. I stayed in the Ali'i tower while many of my co-workers were in one of the other towers- I think there are about 5 in all which are a few minutes' walk from each other. In the middle, there are many shops selling local products so you don't have to go far to find a souvenir. On one end is the beach which is great to have just a few steps away. The many pools are great too; the Ali'i Tower even had its own pool for Tower guests which overlooked the beach (I heard from others that the Ali'i tower is the best) When I arrived, lamps were turned on in my room with robes lying out on the beds and a plate of fresh fruit to welcome me. Hawaiian music was playing on the room radio. My room had a fairly good ocean view although not direct. The amenities at the Hilton are terrific. I appreciated the travel sewing kit when a strap on my dress was torn off. Used the room safe, enjoyed the free bottled water. The room and hotel surroundings are clean, up to date and well-kept. The wedding chapel on the grounds is lovely (and busy when I was there). This hotel was a great place to stay with great service. A little big for my tastes but could be lots of fun for a large family or group of friends.

<Content>Slightly disappointed Stayed at the HHV for 5 nights for our Honeymoon. Wished we had stayed in Maui longer and never came to Oahu. Maybe if HHV had accomodated us and taken care of us on our Honeymoon it would have made a difference but HHV did not take care of us AT ALL. First of all, our travel agent booked us a room in the Rainbow Tower and confirmed with us repeatedly that we were in the Rainbow Tower. When we checked in, it took an HOUR with some trainee because there was a mistake with our reservation. Our travel agent supposedly NEVER booked us in the Rainbow Tower AND she booked us with 2 double beds. In the end, this was true our travel agent made a MAJOR mistake but you would think that HHV would accomodate us as it is our honeymoon AND september IS low season. But they didn't and they couldn't have cared less about us. They put us in the Tapa tower (albeit in a renovated room with a king size bed) but we were NOT satisfied!HHV is a beautiful resort...the animals are great... the staff at the information desk are extremely friendly! The front desk staff stinks! The housekeeping were very nice as well and our room was always clean.But I will NEVER stay in the HHV again because of this incident. It was our HONEYMOON and they did NOTHING, NOTHING to make it memorable.We are seriously disappointed and disatisfied with the service we received. So... if I were you, if you do wish to stay at this hotel make sure BEFORE you arrive in Hawaii that your reservations are confirmed and that you are in the room you paid for. Believe me, HHV WILL NOT take care of you if there is a mistake.I still can't believe they didn't upgrade us on our honeymoon. Every honeymoon couple I have ever met is ALWAYS upgraded!Oh and about the noise... this is true.... too much noise in the hallways AND the construction at the pier is loud... AND Waikiki Beach is filthy. If you want a nice beach on Oahu, rent a car and drive to the North Shore to Sunset Beach, Waimea Bay or south east to Hanauma Bay... Those are stunning! The water is CLEAN! Water may be a bit rougher so be careful but at least you're not swimming in murky water.

<Content>Convenience and luxury all in one place This was our 1st stay at the HHV and I must say, I was impressed by how efficiently everything ran. Originally, our room at the Rainbow Tower was too close to the construction noise but we just requested another room and the front desk was pleasant about giving us a better one. The Heavenly Bed was wonderfully luxurious! We were there a week and ate at just about every restaurant on site, except for Benihana's (which was very crowded and had a 45 minute wait the night we stopped by). If you want to make sure you get a table at some of the more popular restaurants, make a reservation. As it is, there's a variety of restaurants with different types of cuisine to satisfy all appetites. We used the Mandara Spa facilities and gym at the Kalia Tower regularly. The pool there is smaller but much less crowded and quieter than anywhere else. I highly recommend the Mandara Spa. I had a few aches and pains from the flight and was able to get a massage appt the day I arrived. We took the 1/2 day Little Circle Island Tour with E Noa Tours which ran from 2PM-6PM daily. It was just the right amt of time to visit the island without getting worn out. You can book tours directly with the hotel. We were going to visit Pearl Harbor but discovered the wait was over 2 hours so we decided to do that on our next trip. Perhaps that's one tour we'll need to book ahead of time. All in all, I'd stay at the HHV again. It's close to everything, the Hilton management machine works quietly and efficiently, the food is great and the location is quite convenient.

<Content>Very loud and forget the customer service for Diamond Wow what a disappointment. I have stayed at the HHV for the past 5 months (every month for about 4 days at a time on biz). I realize this is a large resort and Diamonds should not expect anything more than a smile, but between the construction noise (in the Tapa Tower--DO NOT stay in the Tapa Tower as there as been on going noise for the past 6 months) constant drilling and water being turned off in the day. And you want a late check out--FORGET it. Diamonds should at least get 3PM check out, no can do at the HHV. After staying here as much as I have, it's time to find another hotel in HNL. Cannot deal with the constant noise and lack of care for their highest level of frequent traveler. If you are looking for construction noise, water outages and no late checkout--then this is your place. Adios HHV...

<Content>NOT for rest and relaxation Okay, here we go.The rooms are nice, the resort as a whole is horrible. So if your not going to leave your room, then you'll be ok, just be sure to keep the door shut, so all the construction noise doesnt get in. Otherwise, I would not recommend this resort.We had to extend our stay 3 extra days (total of 8) and though the registration associate said that if we wanted the same rate 249.99 partial ocean view, we would have to move rooms, (Okay, that is fair.) in the end we had to pay 299.00 a night, for lesser rooms and we still had to move to new rooms.The parking garage is a veritable nightmare, and this resort is too far from anything to walk, unless you've got cross trainers on, and who wears socks in Hawaii?The staff is pleasant, but made many mistakes. Two mistakes were made on my bill, bar charges from another party (the name was VERY different, and was still changed to my name and room number (I easily looked at the reciept and read the room number as not mine.), and they charged me a random 22.00 fee, directly to my cc, that I had to call and make sure they had taken off once I got home, since it did not show on my hotel bill. My room service order was messed up, and the food was so-so. The walls were terribly thin, and I dealt with 3 rowdy pre-teen girls next door, a blaringly loud self-help seminar on another I actually had to ask the person to turn it down, and security/maintenance with their walkie talkies turned up full blast at all hours of the night, roaming the halls. There is construction going on, so there is no peace and quiet to be found at this resort, and the view is marred by all the construction going on. Sitting by the pool all you'll hear is loud contruction drilling. The pools are all very small and dirty, and the resort is so packed that you feel like you are at Disneyland, not in paradise. The pool attendent makes you take a receipt for your pool towel, and they are VERY rude about the whole thing. The only pool I didnt notice a receipt being doled out was the one in the Kalia tower. All the pools were crowded, (probably because they were so small.), but this one was the least crowded...mind you it has no atmosphere, being the closest to the construction.The beach/lagoon is manmade...dont be fooled. This beach wasnt here before the Hiltons made their mark.I travel regularly...and stay in this type of hotel as a regular customer, for business. Im really working on figuring out a different hotel to stay at next time I go to Honolulu..(in 3 weeks). I'll keep you posted on the one I pick next time, it wont be the Hilton Hawaiian Village.

<Content>Stunning Hotel After touring around the western USA on a coach, we were really looking for to a nice relaxation at the Hawaiian Village and wasn't disappointed. I thought I'd died and gone to Heaven. It was a really beautiful hotel. Lovely setting and glorious beach. Couldn't fault it at all. The Italian restaurant on the complex was lovely. If I went back to Oahu again, I would certainly stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village.

<Content>Loved the Hilton, here are some tips for you! We recently stayed for a weekend at the HHV. I used my Hilton points for this stay and since I am a Diamond member, the very friendly lady at the check-in (check in counters by the way are in the open next to the pool...very different than I've been used to) upgraded us to a nice corner room on the 27th Floor in the Rainbow tower with 2 Balconies (one facing the marina and the other facing directly over the beach). We were Wowed by the view once we entered the room! She called it a Specialty room!Some things we noticed:*The pool is crowded and free chairs were rare after 10 am* I received Breakfast coupons (after I asked for them) so if you are Gold/Diamond Hilton member, don't forget these!! We ate our breakfasts at 10 am in the Tapa Cafe, others are closed by this time, very nice Guava Juice, Fruits and Cold cereals* The hotel area is nice with designer shops, penguins, colorful fishes and birds!* They charge extra for additional coffee in the room, restaurants are very expensive, Parking is $16 or $19 personal or Valet* The walk to Ala Moana Blvd stoplight is 5 mins and there you will find a good Thai place ($15 per dish diagonal right), Chinese and Sushi places, turn right and walk a block to the Cheese Burger place or turn left and walk 2 blocks to MacDonalds, Subway, Italian or Chinese places. * We rented from Alamo Car, they are 2 blocks left on Ala Moana, you don't need a car while you are at Hilton unless you want to leave Waikiki to explore, there are buses and trolleys and most activities you book will pick you up at the Hotel* The Fireworks were great in front of the Balcony on Friday night* I didn't think the Friday Jubilee Celebrations (They charge $10 for Poolside seating) was that good* The Beach is great, walk a bit towards left (east) on the beach and you'll see better bargains on rentals ($30 for all day Umbrella and 2 Chairs)We loved it there! It is quite commercial but hey, everyone is having a good time and no one is trying to sell you anything except the Hilton Vacation Clubs! Here is a photo from our room! Enjoy your stay!

<Content>HHV was great We spent the bulk of our vacation on Maui and then used a one-night Hilton reward stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, to have two days and one night on Oahu before flying back to the Mainland. I was a little concerned about the fact that HHV had not been given either a Solid Gold or a Gem in Oahu Revealed, but I had no need to worry, as the HHV treated us well in every way. The room was immaculate and comfortable, as were all other parts of the facility. All staff (front desk, bellmen, cleaning ladies, restaurant workers, pool staff) were polite and competent. They seemed to be laundering pool towels like mad. Waikiki is not everyone's cup of tea. I can see how a huge, hustle-bustle Waikiki facility, and the inevitable crowds that go along with it, are not for everyone. In general, we prefer quiet, low-key, uncrowded destinations, but it was fun to have two days of glitz and glamour. HHV is not a serene, intimate haven worlds apart from Waikiki. To the contrary, it is Waikiki writ large -- big and bold and decorated within an inch of its life, with people photographing themselves by the penguins and flamingoes. But for what it is, it was running like a very well-oiled machine when we were there, and with surprisingly friendly people. The people who offered daytime lei making, hula lessons, etc. for kids in the bar off the main lobby also seemed very nice. I was surprised to find the aloha spirit that I did, in such a big, busy, urban place. We do not enroll our kids in hotel daycamps, but as hotel guests, my daughter and I were able to drop in and partake of these simple activities together for 20 minutes or so, as we wished, free of charge. This enhanced the day for her. We put ourselves behind the eight ball for dinner by enjoying the sunset while bodysurfing, and then heading out to the restaurants with the rest of the crowds, dragging hungry kids who could not endure a long wait. This was our fault, not Waikiki's. We went a few hotels down the beach to the Shore Bird, but the wait was too long, so we ended up out of desperation at Round Table Pizza at the HHV. Suffice it to say that if you live in one of the Italian-American capitals of New Jersey, you do not need Round Table Pizza. Our full American buffet breakfast at the HHV Rainbow Lanai was great -- good food, prompt and attentive service, nice location. We learned our lesson and got downstairs early for breakfast! HHV has a nice, extremely wide section of Waikiki beach, and because it's located on the western end of Waikiki, we had minimal difficulty getting to and from the airport. We found it an easy beach walk to the rest of Waikiki. The surfboard rental concessionaire in front of the HHV seems overpriced, so we went down the beach where competition seems to have lowered the rates. We checked out of our room by 11 a.m., packed a beach bag, stored our luggage, and spent the rest of the day at the pool and beach. By 4:30 p.m., we needed to use the HHV courtesy room to dress for our redeye flight home. We had reserved the room the night before, as you are told to do. At first, I was a little taken aback to find that they did not have a locker room for this purpose, as we have used at the Southampton Princess in Bermuda. They have an unbooked guest room. You go to the front desk for the key, and they tell you where it is. They gave us a 90 minute slot to use it. The woman explained that they list a series of departing guests to use it throughout the day, and that the chambermaids try to clean it between usages, or that they mostly clean it. I took a good outdoor shower in my swimsuit before I went up, not knowing what to expect, and figuring I could at least change in it. We found it immaculate, with fresh complementary toiletries and a chambermaid hovering nearby in the hall. If I were going to Waikiki again, I would gladly return to HHV.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay I have been to Waikiki at least a dozen times. First on many trips with my family while growing-up and later on my own. I have always stayed at either the Moana or Royal Hawaiian. This time however, my partner  I deceided to stay at the HHV for free using my partners Hilton Honors points. Besides being free, I was curious about the 'other side' of Waikiki. We were upgraded to the top floor of the Rainbow tower and had a spectacular ocean view. The resort is huge, a city onto itself. The Mandara Spa is excellent. Service was pleasent enough and the food slightly better than ok. The HHV in many ways reminds me of resorts on the other islands with its many pools and winding paths through tropical gardens. There are extensive fish ponds, as well as flamingos, penquins and parrots. The beach is wider and calmer than at the other end of waikiki. The only thing that irked me was that it cost $50/day for two lounge chairs and an umbrella on the beach. Though with a free room I really can't complain. Though I was used to them being free at the Moana and Royal Hawaiian. The beach bar also wasn't especially nice compared to my stays at the other hotels. The HHV is kinda far away from all of the nightlife and action of Waikiki so we found ourselves aking cabs frequently, though this might be a plus for some people.To sum it up, the HHV is a nice choice and I would consider staying there again even if I had to pay full price.

<Content>Just As I Remembered! Excellent! This property is just beautiful. Our family trip went as planned, we had a fabulous time. This was my 5th trip to this resort but my family's very first time. My husband and 2 daughters, 13  8 loved my surprise of a limo and lei greeting, although I was slightly disappointed in the small, carnation lei's that we paid for in advance, and there were no cold drinks in the limo either. Not a good way to start the trip, but they didn't care, so neither did I. Check-in was very busy but being HHonors member we were able to check in quickly. We had a breathtaking view from our Rainbow Tower Diamond Head 27th floor balcony, unbelievable! That was the closest we have ever been to fireworks, it was like we could reach up and touch them. My kids were in awe.Yes, food prices are higher than we are used to, but we knew this in advance and along with the Entertainment Book we had no problems. Hey, you're in Hawaii! I figure if you can't afford the food at the resort it's best to stay somewhere else in the first place. Although we dined at just about every restaurant on site, our family favorites were Hatsuhana Japanese Cafe and Lapperts Ice Cream shop, and of course, we spent lots of money at the ABC store. Our last night at Benihana's was so much fun, my daughters loved it and the food was delicious. Our favorite breakfast was the yummy all-you-can-eat banana pancakes with Coconut syrup at Wailana (?) coffee shop across the street from the hotel. The food court at the Ala Moana shopping center has many different types of food and was a great people-watching spot. Speaking of shopping, the Ala Moana is a destination itself. Spent WAY too much moolah there! Most fun was the Hawaiian Adventure Water Park, getting belted by the waves at the Bonzai Pipeline, the Dinner Cruise on the Navatek and the Paradise Cove Luau. I had been to this particular luau a few times before, just let me say they have GREATLY improved it. The grounds are cleaner, it seems more organized, but it was so hot we were melting after dark, with no breeze. We happen to be on Oahu during the King K's Celebration so we had a lot of free entertainment, parades, hula competitions, etc...We spent a lot of time at the beach and the Super Pool. My 8 yr old had a blast meeting new friends from all over the world. All in all, everyone at the resort were friendly, service was perfect, weather was perfect, it was a wonderful memory maker for us. We already have reservations for next June, same tower. We wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else.

<Content>HHV Has It All! What a beautiful resort! This place as everything you could need and more. We really enjoyed our stay here. My husband uses a wheelchair and we were able to get around without any problems. Our accomodations were nice, the beds are so comfortable and the views were outstanding. We stayed in the Rainbow and Tapa Towers. The super pool was crowded, but we were able to get chairs around 9AM. The Tapa pool was nice also especially at night, no one was there. The beach and beach walk were great. There were beach performers twirling fire a few evenings. We love the fireworks, but we lost our camera and no one turned it in. We ate breakfast one time each at the Rainbow Lanai and Tapa Cafe and twice for dinner at the Rainbow Lanai. The food was good, in fact the Penne Pasta was my husbands favorite meal all week. We rented a car and used valet parking. Our only problem was that the valet's lost our key, it actually broke off and the valet did not notice it was missing. The valet supervisor was very helpful and we were able to get another car from Hertz (on the property). This is a great place for families and is very busy. I did notice alot of business (convention) people there also. There were a few times I could hear the construction noise, but it did not bother us. All in all I would recommend the HHV.

<Content>Good but what do you expect for the price Hard to rank something like this - if you take on the hotel, the facilites, the services , the location then its clearly 5/5 however once you add in the cost and value becomes a concern it begins to drop. Spent 10 days at the HHV in the Tapa tower (28th Floor) and it was a great stay - room was large and had a side room with bar etc in - view at that height was mainly of the city but very pleasant - room was what you would expect and like others have noted the bed was exceptionally comfortable. The facilites were top notch - well manicured etc etc Beach was average - sand is very strange like dirt it is much nicer along the other end but no matter The super pool well is not that super its not especially big and is especially packed all day untill 5.30 - given it gets dark about 9 or later its way to early. The hotel is packed basically - apparently up to 7000 people on site anyone time, and you feel it - the abc store and main walkways are often packed like the central city - the tour pickup area is smallish and chaotic almost all day - of course this is no big deal but if your after solitude then go elsewhere and that goes for practically everywhere in waikikiBiggest downside is that everything is very expensive and the service in the resturants/bars - pretty average - i understand tipping is a custom but most of the time it was pretty undeserved - i sat in one resturant for at least 20 mins without service or even acknowledgement - and at least 2 other tables of people walked out while i was waiting. Drinks and food are expensive so if cost is an issue then go offsite, plenty of options nearby - the friday night show was good but once again best seats are for sale but there are plenty of other areas to stand around. Overall a good experience, i probbably would not go back but thats mainly because i like new experiences - if you want a all inclusive resort with lots of things happening and not wanting to leave then this would be a good option - if you want solitude or just a room to sleep while your out and about then its probbably not worth the cost.

<Content>A Great Place To Stay I recently visited the HHV for a total of 11 nights and stayed at three different towers.Upon entering the property, you can tell you've entered a contained resort and not just a 'hotel'. The grounds were well maintained, beautiful flora and fauna, a lot of history and of course, the beach. I will leave the beach review out..as it is just as everyone else says...crowded. If you come to Oahu for the sun and sand..drive to Kailua and Lanikai and you will be pleasantly amused and pleased at the tame-ness of the waves.The Kalia Tower was excellent and so was the service. We were tired on most nights as we kept to California time (up at 6am and out for activities by 9am...therefore tired by 8/9pm). I brought my laptop and paid the daily $12.95 unlimited 24 hour use. I had Slingbox on my computer and watched all the A's and Giants game real time and I was not limited to the channels in the room. The in-room dining was excellent..and the side of fruit (versus chips) they served was usually our breakfast.We moved to the Rainbow Tower which was our least favorite. The shower was a bit dingy and needed caulking, but overall, still okay. Great ocean view. The lobby was too crowded for me. Good for tourists, not great if you're there for business or romance. A two star room, versus a 3+ star Kalia room. The great thing was that we were able to watch the fireworks Friday night from our lanai.Part 3 of our stay was at the Ali'i Tower which was amazing. Comfort wise, it was just as cool as the Kalia tower, but this tower had free finger food at 5pm and for us, that was good enough so that we did not have to have big dinners. The concierge was very helpful. They had a little tv in the bathroom area which was cool but we didn't really use it. On one of the days, our room was not made because we left the Do Not Disturb switch on (but we had brought in the door sign). I guess this confused the cleaning lady. I asked her to clean the room and she did but she did not wipe off the bath (i'll deduct points for that). They had slippers that had a Sanitized sign on it..which we did not use since it meant someone else used it. I suggest that if the slippers are a perk, let it be a giveaway. No one wants to use someone else's feet paraphernalia. At least you know the robes go through a good wash.All in all, this was a fabulous hotel that I hightly recommend. At the Rainbow Tower, they don't offer you robes unless you call and ask for them. They were delivered immediately.The people were friendly and courteous and full of the island's aloha spirit. Reading reviews here made me nervous about my trip but I was more than pleased...in fact...I was tremendously happy with the hotel overall and would definitely come back and definitely recommend it.I would rate this a 4 star hotel overall. Aside from the fact that there are a lot of people...(it's a big hotel!!) if you venture out and plan ahead...you find that you don't have to dish out money ...there are a lot of eateries, beaches, historical sites, etc. A lot of stimulation if you want or none if you don't. You will ultimately make your own stay what it will be. This hotel has it all / offers everything. Don't be afraid to ask. They will give it to you with a smile.

<Content>Absolutely Disgusted I booked my holiday for early December this year, back in March, I have paid the final deposits this week, and finalised my trip. My Travel Agent was contacted today requesting that both myself and my partner fill out and sign disclosure forms, agreeing to not complain or request compensation for renovation works that the resort is currently under going.Furthermore, it also includes a statement saying that if during the time we are there, there are no rooms avaliable to us due to these works that any cost in relocating us to another resort would be at our expense... I am absolutely disgusted to think that I have paid out so much money, to be given this treatment... Also I would love to know why neither myself or my travel agent were told about these renovations at any point along the booking until after it has all been finalised. It shows extremely bad business practise on behalf of the resorts operators and leaves me feeling completely ripped off! I am now looking into cancelling my holiday and finding another location.I hope that this can help other travellers before you make the mistake that I have made by booking a holiday to this resort.

<Content>Fabulous!!!! Just returned from a 2 week stay at the HHV and had fantastic holiday. We were upgraded to a suite in the Rainbow tower and could not fault the room, view or service.Fortunately for us the exchange rate was very good so everything in the hotel was very reasonably priced (with the exception of wine). Quality and standard of food, service, etc very good.Don't worry about getting sunbed at Superpool (they start to queue at 8.00 am for these) there's always beds available upto about 11.00 at the Tapa Tower Pool and the Mandara Spa Pool is always nice and quiet if you prefer a more relaxing atmosphere. Beach is also good not as crowded as I expected.ABC store on site always very busy - use the once across the road.Don't sign up for any organised excursions its really easy to get about on your own. Enjoyed most things we did but there were one or two things that were enjoyable but weren't value for money; Sea Life Park unless you want to swim with the Dolphins there's not a lot there and it was expensive - don't waste your money. 3 Star dinner cruise food and entertainment was good however you leave about 5pm and you're back about 7.30 pm evening is too short and very expensive - once again not value for money. Polynesian Centre good if you've got kids and unless you enjoy hands on and joining in on activities not worth paying the money for.Must see's Pearl Harbour (get there early we were there at 9.00 and still had a 2.5 hour wait), Battle Ship Missouri, Bowfish Submarine,Punchbowl (very interesting and excellent views of Oahu, Paradise Cove Luau, Bishop's Musuem, Diamond Head Crater - a bit of climb but not as bad as it looks worth the walk excellent views. Hire a car and and drive along the coast - gorgeous beaches and scenery.Good restaurants - Cheescake factory (get there early), Keo's (Thai Food book a table), Hula Grill (book a table), Hard RockCafe (no need to book). Best steak the Chart House next door to HHV on the marina - excellent and reasonably priced.Evening entertainment Sociey of Seven good show a little expensive.Had fantastic holiday, this is the first time we've used Trip Advisor and we got some excellent tips.Can't wait to go back.

<Content>I love this great resort!!!!! To us, HHV is the finest resort we have ever seen. No other resort, we have ever seen has the ambience of HHV. I have seen resorts that are at least as glamorous, but the heart and soul of HHV goes way beyond glamor. For those who shun Waikiki because of the crowds, I can say that I have never seen crowds on the fine stretch of beach. I would have to say that my favorite part of staying at HHV is the open lobby -- especially at night, when live entertainment is playing. For those who have a different taste in music, there is always at least one band playing in each of the towers, so anyone can find live music that they can enjoy. We always think of HHV as the perfect resort: perfect for a first trip to Hawaii, perfect for returning vacationers, perfect for weddings, perfect for anniversaries. There are many beautiful exotic resorts, but there is only one Hilton Hawaiian Village.

<Content>Aloha!! Well what did you expect? Stayed here for 6 nights on the second leg of our honeymoon(after Vegas).Got upgraded to the Ali'i tower when we checked in at the airport free of charge when they were told it was our honeymoon.Very nice.Private pool+spa,gym and free hor'douves(hope i spelt that correctly)every night.Could not have been closer to the beach,lovely room done in a very tasteful colonial type style+easily the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in! An absolutly beautiful resort with tropical gardens and a vast array of wildlife in and around the waterfalls etc. Only complaint was a lack of a proper beachside bar,but we went a couple of hotels down to the Outrigger,who have a great one,so no real problem at all.Liked it so much my friend is getting married there in September.

<Content>Didn't want to leave.... Like most other people we had read a lot of mixed reviews about the Hilton, but then we've read mixed reviews from other places we've stayed in and loved, so we figured there are always going to be people who'll complain about the incidentals and you're never going to please all the people all the time, so we'd stick with our choice - and we're glad we did.Coming from England, this was obviously quite a big trip for us (parents and 2 'kids' in their early 20's) so we had a quite long stay of 17 nights. This was our first trip to Hawaii and we wanted to make the most of it (and make the 24hr travel worthwhile!)Overall we loved our stay. The grounds are beautiful and despite being such a massive hotel you didn't feel too cramped. It was a lovely place to walk around. Being right on the world famous Waikiki beach was obviously a big plus too. Having walked almost the entire length of Waikiki (to go to the Sunset on the beach movie) we reckon that the Hilton enjoyed one of the largest areas of beach, and with few other hotels in the area, there was plenty of space for everyone.Being away from the main Waikiki crowd meant that access in and out of the HHV was probably easier than at other hotels. We had a hire car for our entire stay and liked to make the most of it.While the Super Pool closes around 5.30, the Tapa pool is open til 10 meaning we enjoyed several evening swims after a day out exploring the island - a lovely way to end the day!We had booked 2 partial ocean view rooms and actually ended up being upgraded to full ocean view (Diamond Head Tower 9th floor) because they were unable to put our two rooms nearby in partial views. If we had booked for full ocean view, we may have been a bit disappointed, but as it was, the views were lovely, and being able to sit and have breakfast on your balcony overlooking the Pacific certainly is a good way to start the day (the view of the beach was just slightly obscured by the Hale Koa next door and all the hundreds of palm trees lining the beach - not that that was a problem with us!!) It's definitely worth buying breakfast items from the ABC store or Walmart etc, as it saves you so much money that can be better spent elsewhere! (oh and by the way, we didn't find Hawaii to be as expensive as everyone makes out, just don't stay onsite the entire time - enjoy the whole island!!)As mentioned previously, we spent a lot of our time out exploring the island - it's not that often we get to drive on a highway by the ocean in the tropics! On the whole we loved Oahu. Particular favourites were the Ko Olina lagoons (OK they're man made, but they're beautiful and have that 'picture perfect' look you're after! Make sure you stop at the security booth for a beach pass - after driving further up the coast we realised why they do this - let's just say, Ko Olina is definitely the nicest spot on the Waianae side!) We also loved Ala Moana beach park which is really convenient from the Hilton - and plenty of free parking (as with much of the rest of the island - except Waikiki!). As the beach is backed by a park, there are plenty of lovely trees around if you fancy a bit of shade. Also at Ala Moana is the shopping centre which is definitely worth a look (especially if you're from the UK and any American shops become that much more interesting!) We also enjoyed a couple of fun and yummy meals at the Bubba Gump restaurant here.We spent a couple of days headed up to North Shore - unfortunately not the right time of year for the world famous surfing, but pretty cool to visit nonetheless, and easier to take a dip in the ocean without drowning! Waimea was very pretty - and completely different to the surf beach image it has - more like a mill pond in summer! Fun to watch all the people jumping from the rocks. We also visited Sunset and Turtle beaches. Turtle beach is definitely worth a visit - but not for a whole day or to swim. Come here to visit the turtles who'll let you take a look if they're feeling nice! We stopped by here 3 times and there were turtles on the beach twice, so I guess we were pretty lucky. It was pretty cool to see these massive prehistoric looking creatures make their way to shore - just don't get too close! Just up the road is Ted's bakery - a favourite of Dad's! Recommend any baked goods! Especially the haupia pie! Mmm...A couple of beaches worth mentioning on the Windward side are Lanikai and Kahlua - gorgeous turquoise seas and off shore islands - good to make the folks back home jealous!!Trips out: Pearl Harbour and Diamond Head are definitely worthwhile. Just be prepared to wait a while at Pearl Harbour - get there as early as possible or you may not be able to get a boat over - the day we went they had given all the passes out by about 11. We arrived around 9.30 and had a couple of hours before our trip. Very poignant though. (We would like to respectfully point out that Pearl Harbour marked the USA's entry to WW2 - not the beginning of the war - we were there a few years earlier!)So, all in all had a great time. Just a few niggles about the hotel:1. Front desk and valet can be a little abrupt verging on rude at times - you can be ignored by front desk, or pounced upon as soon as a valet sees you, even if you're just pulling over to pick someone up.2. The Super Pool. It really was a lovely setting, right by the beach, but nowhere near enough chairs for everyone to enjoy it. People seem to get there earlier, dump a towel on the chair and leave it for most of the day while they go off to eat etc, meaning that if you actually want to use the pool area, there is nowhere to go. There needs to be some control on how long things are left. We managed to spend some time there (one quite early start to get in line!) but not as much as we'd have liked. Still, we enjoyed using the Tapa pool instead - much more convenient.3. Charges. As everyone says, the HHV do like to extract the maximum cash from your wallet. We had no problems with charging for extra coffee - you get a sachet free per day which easily makes 2 cups (how much coffee do you need?!?) but we did object to the $16/day to park - especially as there appeared to be too many places set aside for valet or reserved for 'special' events etc. The cost for loungers and parasols on the beach is crazy so we came prepared - 2 sand chairs and 2 parasols from Walmart for about $35 for our entire stay - quite a bargain!!So, to sum it up, we loved Oahu and would recommend staying at the HHV - just make sure you don't spend all your time there, or you'll miss out on what this beautiful island has to offer!

<Content>Ali'i Tower and HHW overview We visited the HHW for 11 nights and this time around stayed in the Ali'i Tower. This part of the facility has its own reception area for checking in. Although arriving late at night, the front desk staff present were very helpful and we were soon settled into our room. My son (age 7) had a sofa bed to sleep on and he found this very comfortable. I understand that the rooms in this particular tower were all refurbished within the last year.The swimming pool at the Ali'i Tower is nice to swim in and is all at one depth (4ft 3inches). The pool itself never felt overcrowded although the majority of the seats surrounding the pool were reserved by towels and not people. There is key access to Ali'i Tower guests to the beach from the swimming pool area.Some of the massage services on offer at the Mandara Spa are also available at the Ali'i Tower. The Ali'i Tower has two massage rooms; these are both well maintained but both rooms are windowless. I would agree with comments made regarding the chairs at the Superpool; there aren;t enough of them to go around for everyone who wishes to use the pool. It also closes at 5.30pm each evening.We saw the fireworks on Friday night (the HHW have a fireworks display every Friday evening) and they were spectacular. Many people were watching the display from the beach (and a nice view of same can also be obtained from the pool terrace at the Ali'i Tower).The HHW has plenty of shops and restaurants to suit all budgets. The phonecards available from the ABC store represent great value for money and give plenty of talk time for both domestic (US based) and international calls.Our son used the Keiki/kids club at the HHW and enjoyed his half day there with the HHW carers at the zoo. Parents need to book this a few days in advance; the book for reserving such a place for the child is placed near to the excursions desk just off the lobby area (I mention this as it took us a little while to locate it).I note that the main lobby area now has express check in services. We enjoyed our holiday very much at the HHW and will return one day!.

<Content>Overcrowded and not worth the price You will not find a chair at any of the pools if you do not get to the pools at the crack of dawn and you have to pay $12 for a chair at the beach. We called maintainance twice, but no one ever came to the room to fix the hook behind the bathroom door and the loud exhaust fan. One day, when we got back to the room around 5p, we had to call housekeeping to make the room. They came about 2 hours later. The grounds are nice with penguins, restaurants, and shops, but the rooms are only so-so. Friends on our trip stayed at other hotels closer to Diamond Head and had a much better experience.

<Content>Great Resort Hotel! 11 of us stayed in 4 rooms Aug. 3-5. We were in the Ali'i Tower. WOW. The beds were the most comfortable hotel beds we'd ever slept in. I had 4 people in my room and we had plenty of room with a great view of the big pool. The Ali'i Tower has free appetizers from 5pm-7pm on the second floor pool deck which was a bonus, plus this tower has it's own pool, whirlpool and workout area. There is a conceirge on the first floor that is very helpful and helped us make dinner and golf reservations.The restaurants in this hotel can be pricey, but if you walk a couple of blocks down Ala Moana (left) you'll come to McDonald's, Starbucks, Outback and the Ala Moana mall that has lots of places to eat. There's also a 24 hour coffee shop across Ala Moana from the hotel that was good.The beach area is nice, but chairs are expensive so go to the ABC store and buy a cheap chair or a beach mat. We highly recommend this resort!

<Content>Great spot We just returned from first trip to Hawaii and the HHV. Overall, we were impressed with the property. The grounds are lovely and the pools are nice--much nicer than most of the other hotels we saw in Waikiki. Waikiki itself is very crowded, and the HHV is no exception. It really did seem like a village. We were at the Kalia tower, which I highly recommend as it provided a nice quiet respite from the crowds and has its own pool and check-in. Rooms were new and lovely. Service was very good. Biggest negative was that the super pool closed at 5:30 each evening. Given that this is a family resort, this early of a pool closure seemed ridiculous. Pool always seemed crowded, and as others have noted, chairs are almost impossible to find. If we return to Oahu, we would stay here again.

<Content>A great 3 week stay! We recently stayed 3 weeks in the Rainbow tower while my husband was attending a school for his work. The property itself is wonderful! The service, the housekeeping, the rooms, everything, with one exception.....the food is great but way overly priced, especially if you are there for three weeks. There is a reasonable buffet if you go to the early bird special, but the steak house, Italian restaurant and all are good, but very expensive. I would highly recommend this property to anyone going to Hawaii.

<Content>Lagoon tower overpriced..... spotty service Arrived 8/2/06. The water had been out that day, but had been restored by the time we checked in. But the AC was out, and wasn't restored till late in the evening. And when it was, the bedroom AC vents did not work well. I was told by staff that bedrooms in the Lagoon tower were like that, and that they receive many complaints about that. I was looking forward to the Duke lagoon that was right outside of the hotel, but it was closed because of the construction of a new hotel tower, which is scheduled to be completed in 2009. So you can look at the lagoon, but that is it. And the construction noises go on all day... but since I was busy anyway, that didn't bother me much. However, the construction crew did break a water main the morning we were to check out... so no water or showers for us as we were preparing for the 12 hour travel home.The first day we did not receive housekeeping. We inquired about it when we got back from our daily activities, but we were told that housekeeping leaves at 4pm. We went to the main registration lobby at the hotel to complain, and they sent hotel housekeeping to do our room that night.The hike to the beach is long (which is why I was looking forward to the lagoon).... two chaise lounges and an umbrella cost 51 bucks a day. But if you rent them for the duration of your stay, they will set them up for you in the front row and reserve them for you in the morning.. The super pool closes early, and the lagoon tower pool and hot tub closes at 7pm.As expected, you are nickel and dimed a lot there. At 500 a night though, I was hoping for better service and less extra charges for stuff.The beach is nice, the staff is friendly, and you really don't have to leave the resort for anything. As expected, the food at the hotel restaurants is pricey. For me and 2 kids, pizza at the pool and three drinks (one for me and 2 sodas for hte kids) was over 60 bucks. Dinner for 2 adults and two kids will set you back over 150 bucks.We took a Grand circle Island tour with a stop at the Dole plantation which was very nice. Very good tour guide named Ed, around 66 years old. Very knowledgable and informative. The Tapa tower bus depot was very convenient and well run for the tours we took.If you are going to rent a car, don't wait in line at the Hertz desk for a half hour only to be told there are no cars available that day. Instead, walk to Ala Moana Blvd, turn left and walk a block to Alamo at discovery bay shopping center. No waiting. But watch the 70 dollar charge for letting them fill up the tank upon return. They tell you that they will fill up the tank at 3 fifteen a gallon (10 cents cheaper than what the stations are charging) and then try to slip the 70 dollar charge past you for that service. Save the 70 bucks and fill it up yourself.We rented a car and it was nice to have that freedom to go about the island. We went to Pearl, Diamond Head Crater, Huamauna Bay for snorkeling (a must do---it is only 5 bucks a person but breathtaking), and drove to the North Shore.About Pearl.... there are three things there.... the AZ Memorial. The Bowfin Sub and Museum, and the USS Missouri. In the morning ALL the tour groups show up at the AZ Memorial at 7 am and the lines last 60-90 minutes to get in. By 11 am, they are gone. So around noon is hte time to show up in your rental to get right in, and have plenty of time and space to look at the museum and stuff before you go out on the launch. As for the Bowfin and the Mighty Mo, you could easily spend 3 hours at each location. That is what we did. We went out to Pearl three times. One for each of the attractions. Had a great time with no waiting.We really enjoyed the Todai Japanese Seafood buffet at the intersection of Kallii and Ala Moana. Anyway.. the lagoon tower was OK. It was comparable to some other 1br suites w/ kitchen we stayed in in say Florida. However, for the 500 bucks a night, hte service was spotty and we paid about twice as much as compared to similar facilities elsewhere on the mainland.

<Content>Great hotel We stayed at the HHV at the beginning of August for our Wedding Anniversary, it is a lovely hotel and very impressive upon arrival. The grounds are fantastic, with the penguins and flamingos.When we arrived at the hotel I told them it was our Wedding Anniversary and they offered a room upgrade straight away with no charge even though the hotel was at its maximum capacity, this did mean it had to be cleaned and we had to wait 3 hours but we went and ate and had a walk around while they stored our luggage. It was well worth the wait the room was in the Rainbow Tower on the 27th Floor with an ocean view 鈥?it was absolutely fantastic 鈥?the only thing I could say for the first few minutes was WOW. The only downside is that you do have to pay for the tea and coffee and even bottled water in the room whereas most hotels this is complimentary. But we just took others advice and went to the ABC store and bought them all for a lot less. It is definitely in the best area of Waikiki, we walked the length of the beach up to the main area and the beach is a lot narrower there and obviously more crowded, it can get a little busy directly in front of the hotel, but if you turn right then it is a little quieter there but the beach attendants aren鈥檛 allowed to put umbrellas down that area so there won鈥檛 be any shade, but we didn鈥檛 mind this. The sunbeds are expensive to rent 25$ for the 2 all day, but only being there for 5 days we didn鈥檛 mind that 鈥?we did buy 2 airbeds to start with which was only 7$ and sat on those the first day which is a cheaper way of doing it and you see lots of people with the same idea. We sometimes like to sit by the pool but there was no way I was queuing up in a morning by the pool until it opened to get a lounger, it was then in complete shade by the afternoon anyway. We watched from the balcony as they opened the pool and it was funny, as we literally watched them run for the sunbeds!!!The weather was a bit mixed, a couple of days the sun didn鈥檛 burn the cloud off until 11.30 and then by 4pm it was cloudy again but in between these times it was scorching hot! So if you like the sun don鈥檛 take shade and plan on coming back out when it is cooler as you may have missed the sun by then!!We ate both out of the resort and in the restaurants on the resort and yes they are expensive but not ridiculously. The Italian Sergio鈥檚 was fantastic and a lovely atmosphere. We went to Duke鈥檚 which is at the Outrigger Hotel, lovely place and the food was great but had an hour wait which didn鈥檛 bother us we bought drinks while we waited, although beware they have a silly rule there where they only sell you 1 drink per person that is at the bar i.e. my husband couldn鈥檛 go to the bar and buy our drinks they would only serve him his own drink, so we both had to go each time we wanted a drink, they call it stacking!!! We had a fab time, but Hawaii is not what I expected, Waikiki is very commercialised and is just like any other busy American city, but when you are on the beach you seem to forget all that. It is quite handy knowing there are loads of shops close by, where you know you can buy anything. The jewellery there is gorgeous and a really good buy. I think if we had stayed on a quieter island I am sure it would have been the tropical place you imagine it to be, but Waikiki is a lovely place, just expect it to be busy.Hope you find this helpful.

<Content>What a rip off!!! Just returned from a two week vacation in Oahu and Maui of which our last three nights were spent at the HHV due to its proximity to the airport. The resort is great in terms of it's location, variety of shops and restaurants. However, these traits are overshadowed by how the hotel and staff try to nickel and dime you on everything. For charging you $4 for a bag of coffee to use with the coffee pot in your room to .50 cents for a cup of water by the pool! It's ridiculous!!! In addition, there are 5 towers with one timeshare tower for a total of 6 and 3000 rooms among them but only 2 pools!!! There are no extra chairs so people end up laying out their towels on floor next to the pool to sit or lay down. The hotel caters to the Japanese with their strong yen currency and is very evident in their pricing structure. There are better places to stay in Oahu but i wouldn't want that place to get overcrowded!!!

<Content>Hilton is overrated We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian hotel for one week. I thought being at a resort would provide us with the amenities we needed since I took my elderly mother and three teenagers. What a mistake!First, it took us an hour to check in. I spent half an hour in line and the other half at the desk. I have never had a more complicated check-in at any hotel and I have travelled extensively. They had the reservation, so that wasn't the problem. They required driver's licenses for the adults who were responsible for each room (even though I was paying for all rooms with a single credit card) and required the names of each person staying in the room. They argued with me about the bed arrangements; I needed two rooms with two beds and one with one bed, which seemed beyond the comprehension of the desk clerk.When we got to the room, there was no water. There was a construction problem and the entire hotel was affected. I called the manager who told me that the desk clerk was supposed to have told us, but that didn't happen. I was also told they did not know when the water would be restored. I requested a move to the only tower which had water (there are five at this hotel) and was told I would get a lower quality room. I elected not to move and tried to get to another hotel. There was a convention (which I was attending) and rooms were scarce. We elected to stay and the hotel finally made an adjustment on the bill .The property, while beautiful, is huge and hard to navigate, particularly for my mother who has some difficulty walking. There are only three available pools, unless you stay in the Ali'i tower, which has its own private pool for its guests. (we were not in that tower). There is no adult pool, so there is no quiet place to enjoy the sun. The main pool, close to our room, has people lining up at least 30 minutes before it opens to secure chairs. I don't want to be on vacation at a resort where I have to line up to sit in the sun.Unlike every other hotel I have ever stayed in, this hotel did not have any information about activities in the city. There were no brochures of any kind. They had a desk to book outside excursions through the hotel (e.g. Pearl Harbor), or activities on premises, but nothing else. You had to know what you wanted to do before going to the desk. This desk had several people there, but they would not make a dinner reservation for you if it was not on the property. There was a single concierge to do that. With a hotel housing thousands of people, this was very odd. The purpose is to keep you on the property and to spend all your money there.Also, while I expected things to be expensive, I felt as though Hilton went out of its way to make it ridiculously expensive. It felt like gouging. To rent just a beach chair for the day was $36. Just next door, at a local vendor, the rental for two beach chairs and an umbrella was $12. One packet of coffee in the room was complimentary; every pot after that cost $3.75. Even simple meals were outrageous. (It was actually cheaper to order the breakfast buffet than to order toast, juice and coffee). We weren't allowed to sit in a patio area near the pool unless we ordered something from the bar/cafe. I've paid less at the Plaza Hotel in New York and the Ritz-Carlton in San Francisco. Our reservations included a dining credit for each room which we were told would be taken off the bill upon check out. Yet on the last morning, our final bill was put under the door, and did not have the credit posted. When I checked out (another half hour at the desk), I asked about the credit and received it. I believe that Hilton deliberately does not give the credit unless you ask; I'm sure there are many people who forget to ask and just leave without insuring this credit is given.There are also no quiet places to sit and enjoy a drink or watch the sunset in the evening. Every bar/cafe has some sort of musical group; there is no way to avoid it. The restaurants are quiet enough, but I like being outside in the evening and we just could not do that. The pool areas are all closed in the evening, so that's not an option.I felt that most of the staff (with a few exceptions) was indifferent to the needs of the guests. I believe this is part of the corporate mindset. At one of the restaurants on the premises, I wanted to put the bill on my room. The way the waitress acted, you'd have thought I was the only person ever to have requested that. I realize she needed to insure that I was indeed a guest of the hotel, but in obtaining information from me, she made me feel as though I was trying to get away with something. Another time when we were at the pool (a small one very far from our rooms, but somewhat quieter than the others), we tried to get a table with an umbrella. The day before there had been several at this location; this day there were only four. When I asked the pool attendant, his answer was that they were doing something with the umbrellas and he didn't know when they would be returned to the area. There was one table near the entrance that had no one sitting at it. Because of the proximity to the building entrance, it was a poor placement, with people constantly running into it. I asked him if he could move the umbrella, since there was a table on the other side without one. He refused, saying there were people using it. (there wasn't anyone at the table and it did not have anything on it) I asked him to call maintenance to get another one. He reluctantly agreed. Finally, another vacationer helped move the umbrella.I felt the attitude of the staff is that they are doing you a favor to do things, even though we paid quite a lot of money for the rooms.I would not stay at this hotel again and will likely not stay at a Hilton again.

<Content>Very nice but quite expensive! Me and me partner stayed in the Diamond Head tower, this hotel was huge!! It had several stores including Louis Vutton! It was very clean and well looked after, staff were friendly but then so are most people in Hawaii. The room was large and cleaned all the time, there was everything you needed in the room. We had a room over looking the tapa pool which was one grade up from the basic rooms, the sunsets where beautiful and the fireworks on Friday nights are worth sticking around for. The only downsides to this hotel were that it was expensive, a cocktail and a beer was around $18 dollars and we didn't eat in the restaurants as they were too expensive for our budget! There were lots of restaurants outside of the hotel, the usual american chains, Outback Steakhouse and Red Lobster are just around the corner. Also the pool was always way too crowded and it was hard to get a seat, for the amount of guests this hotel has and the amount you pay to stay, there should be more swimming pools! All in all the hotel is in a great location and the beach is beautiful, if i was to go back to Hawaii i would go somewhere less commercialised as this is the only major downside. Lots to do in Hawaii!

<Content>Great place for kids! We just returned from a 9 day stay at HHV and it was great! We used Hilton Honor points for our stay. Since we are Diamond level Hilton Honors members we were upgraded to a large suite on the 27th floor of the Rainbow Tower with two lanais overlooking the ocean. The view was spectacular! The suite was very large with two full baths which came in handy with the kids. We were also given coupons for a free continental breakfast buffet each day with the option to upgrade to the full buffet for $5 more per adult or $3 more per child over 4. This buffet is normally $21.25/adults and $16.50/children. We really felt like they treated their Diamond members well.The grounds at the hotel are just beautiful with waterfalls and ponds. There are all kinds of fish, penguins, flamingos, etc. on the grounds. The kids really enjoyed this.There are some negatives to this resort. If you are looking for a nice quiet place to stay then this is not for you. It is very busy and crowded. The pool area is very crowded. You can only get a chair by the pool if you get there when the pool opens. We just stayed out on the beach each day instead of fighting the crowd at the pool. The beach area is nice but also got a little crowded at times. The kids didn't mind it though. The hotel is overpriced on a lot of things, but we expected it for Hawaii. The beach umbrella and two chairs cost us $50/day. Valet parking was $19/day - self parking is $16/day. The restaurants are pricey with just average food. We ate most of our meals away from the resort. Bubba Gump' Shrimp in the Ala Moana Shopping Center was our favorite. We did purchase a Hawaii Entertainment Guide for $12.99 before our trip and it had lots of restaurant deals that were great. Most were for buy one get one free meals. There were also lots of deals for most of the attractions. I would hightly recommend this Guide. We do plan on returning to this resort in the future because it is a great place for kids.

<Content>Love the hotel but eat elsewhere This was our fourth trip to the HHV and it is by far the best hotel on the strip. While everyone knows that Wakiki is busy and city like, the crowds do not bother us because we know we are not on Kauai or Maui. But the beach is great and the pools are fine although one must eat elsewhere unless you are a millionaire.Since we were travelling with a family of four, we could not even consider eating at the hotel. Most meals in the restaurants were upwards of 25 to 45 dollars a piece. Lunch menus saw 13.00 hamburgers and 3.75 sodas. Breakfast buffet was 21.95 each.A family of four would spend more than $250.00 a day on food!We settled for the coffee shop across the street or jumped in our car or a cab to other areas in Waikiki such as the Ward Center or the Mall to partake of more reasonable meals. Dont get me wrong---its a great Hotel and I will stay there again on my next visit----but the cost of food is off the charts (in fact most restaurants were not full when we walked by)

<Content>Here is the deal... Just returned from 8 days at HHV. Overall, a nice place to stay. I was not traveling with kids, but would definitely recommend this hotel to families (lots of kids, made me miss mine!) I pictured the grounds to be much bigger, but actually the towers are very close - you can be around the entire resort in 5 minutes. It is located on the far end of Waikiki Beach (not Waikiki Proper) -- so, the beach is a bit less crowded, and maybe not as pretty. The better bars, restaurants, etc. are down the beach some but an easy walk. Rooms are average, clean and have plenty of room for 2.In general, you have to remember that the Honolulu-area is like many other US cities (except the beautiful beaches and views). It is crowded and commuting is bad. If you get a car (which I highly recommend), you need to leave right after rush hour and be back at the hotel by 4:00 (or wait to 7:30) or you will be sitting in major traffic. Please make sure you don't spend your entire trip in Waikiki - it is nice, but east Oahu is quite nice and has some beautiful beaches and stopping points with great views. My favorite area was the North Beach area... it is what I pictured Hawai'i to be like. Cool, kinda funky, surfer towns, (Haleiwa) with lots of great little casual restaurants and awesome beaches. Everyone seems to recommend Hanauma Bay for snorkeling - it was beautiful, but VERY crowded. Instead, drive up to Sharks Cove on the North Shore. For eating, the resort is fine. The other reviews made it sound so expensive, but it is just like any other resort destination. The pizza place is good for a quick, inexpensive meal. Bali by the Sea is very nice. Loved Roy's Restaurant in East Oahu - great food and great service. Splurged on Alan Wongs (the best restaurant in Honolulu) and was slightly disappointed. Went for the chef's tasting menu with wine ($90/pp).... food was good, service OK, and wine skimpy (desserts were great).Also, if going to Pearl Harbor, it really does pay to get up and leave by 6:00am. The line gets crazy long by 7:30 (tons of buses). Try to go on Wed, so you can visit the memorial and then walk up the street to the Swap Meet at Aloha Stadium- all the Hawaiin trinkets, clothes, jewelry that you see is there and much cheaper. Definitely worth the trip.Have fun, but don't spend your entire trip at the HHV - explore all parts of the island and you'll have a better experience. There is hiking, small, more intimate beaches  lots of food choices throughout the island. Enjoy.

<Content>Best Hotel in Waikiki Simply put this hotel is the best in Waikiki! Take it from someone who has been here 5 times over the past 10 years. This is the first time I have stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian and believe me I will look no further and I have stayed at some pretty nice places out there! The landscape is absolutely beautiful with tropical flowers everywhere, waterfalls and the kids will even love the penguins, turtles, flamingos etc. The service was great! The staff was friendly from the time we checked in until the time we checked out and everywhere in between. We stayed in the Kalia Tower and if you have heard stories about the mold in the rooms believe me that is ancient history. They did a renovation about a year or so ago and this is now a very nice tower. This tower even has their own check in and check out services. The only other tower on their premises that has this is the Ali'i Tower. The Super pool is just that. Super!!!! After spending a good day on the beach it is nice to hit the super pool in the late afternoon to get out of the sun. During the later part of the afternoon the super pool is completely shaded which after being in the sun all the day is a good thing. The Hilton Hawaiian does have a reputation of somewhat nickel and diming you to death, but that is if you let them. The smartest thing to do is to eat, shop and spend your money outside of the resort area. There are plenty of nice restaurants and plenty of nices places to shop around the area that are within walking distance. Prices outside of the resort are much more reasonable. There is a Wailie Coffee House just right outside the resort which is open 24 hours a day and has great food and coffee. For Great Ribs there is a Tony Romas close by. Trust me, get outside the resort. Not only will you see more of Waikiki, but you will also spend a lot less money. Parking is about $15 a day for self-parking and $4 more for Valet. The internet service is $12.95 a day and if you do plan on using their on site gym, they will charge you for that too. I never used it so I don't know how much they charge for that. So be careful how you spend your money. A travelers tip: If you plan on renting a car you may want to know that gas out there is about 30 cents more on the gallon than what you will pay on the mainland. Overall this place has it all! Friendly service! A Very Hawaiian Feel about it and as mentioned above Tropical Landscaping and shops everywhere. And oh yeah if you want great pizza go to the Round Table Pizza which is right on premises. Their prices their are very much like what you would pay anywhere at home and the pizza is definitely the best in Waikiki.

<Content>Not worth it at all! As a Hilton Honors Diamond Member I was not impressed at the least. The property was over crowded with two conventions and a whole lot of hotel stuffed on a small amount of property. I was dissatisfied with the condition of the first room (they did not honor my diamond status and I did not get an immediate upgrade and no amenities at all for that matter.) The first night I was in the Tapa tower on the 6th floor. The hallways were dirty and walpaper and paint was peeling. The room had similar conditions and the bathroom was very well used. After complaints to the management I was given a one bedroom suite in the same tower on the 10th floor for the next night. I was not told that with this upgraded room came the construction on the floor above me. I was woken up at 7 am when the construction was scheduled to begin at 9am. I was given a credit of $100 but if you have been to Hawaii, that will just about buy you one fruity drink with an umbrella and a salad. The construction began at the same time on the third morning. Check out is at 11am SHARP and you will not be given any courtesy time what so ever. The pools were small and you had to fight for a seat, make sure you don't get up for too long the vultures will steal your chair. Don't use the pool by Tapa tower the sun will fade behind a building at about 3 pm. The beach was not great either, very rocky and many jelly fish. If you like shopping and eating you will find plenty at this hotel. About the only thing going for it

<Content>Lovely Resort with a Fabulous Staff I was fortuneate to have had the opportunity of staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for three nights at the Kalia Tower in late April and two nights at the Rainbow Tower in mid-May as the stopover point on a trip to Australia. What a wonderful way to begin and end this vacation!!!!The property is absolutely gorgeous...spotlessly maintained on the widest stretch of Waikiki Beach. Flamingos and penguins, orchids and koi pools, parrots with Aloha greetings all add to the tropical appeal of this resort.The shops offer everything from Louis Vuitton to a very family friendly ABC convenient store. Restaurants are casual beachside to gourmet cuisine. There is truly something for most everyone's taste and budget.However, I was most impressed by the staff. They were professionals in the art of customer service with emphasis on courtesy and helpfulness with a smile. Early arrival rooms were available on both stops with a minimal wait and great attention to our luggage. Shops' staffs assisted with post cards and more expensive purchases with the same great care. Wait staff were personable and attentif. I cannot say enough about my encounters with them. They did a fabulous job representing Hilton Hotels and the Hawaiian Islands!We were dreaming about a vacation in Hawaii before we left for Australia, which is another wonderful destination! Aloha!!

<Content>Has Anybody Seen Our 2 Bedroom Suite? We've loved Hawaii since my husband and I honeymooned there 24 years ago. In August of 2001 we purchased a lovely 2 bedroom plus suite with ocean view at the Lagoon Tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki. We've stayed at this resort mutltiple times and have always enjoyed an above average vacation. Yes, they nickel and dime you to death, but having a kitchen and laundrey facilities you can creatively save alot of money. Our room with its two beautiful ocean view balconies was the key selling point for us. To begin each morning and end each night in these lovely surroundings was what enhanced our experience.  We just returned from our Hawaiian vacation and were utterly disappointed. As a previous tripadvisor member has noted, we also were downgraded to a one bedroom suite with an attached studio lockout. The rooms were smaller, older and much less luxurious. The total layout was not what we expected as we usually get a master bedroom with master bath, a separate bedroom with two double beds, and a much larger kitchen/dining area/family area with a central spacious bathroom. In the past, we had two lanais with lovely views of the ocean. This time, hower, there was only one lanai and, being on the 5th floor, the view was not great. When we complained we were told that they had every right to substitute the smaller one bedroom and attached studio as the hotel and HGVC viewed this as an even exhange. During the sales presentation, I specifically asked our saleman, Terry Adams, if we would always receive these exact accomodations and he answered emphatically yes. Since this timeshare cost a good deal of money, not to mention airfare invested to get there, we were terribly disappointed. We also were told that we should have advised the HGVC counselor when making the reservation that we did not want a hotel lockout style room. Since we never even considered that a possiblity, I feel it was their responsibility to advise us that they were changing our style of accomodation and not put the onus on us. I definitely think they knew exactly what they were doing and didn't really care if we were unhappy or felt cheated. We also spoke to people who stayed there who were not Hilton Hawaiian owners who had better accomodations than us. It's hard to believe that HGCV would take advantage of owners in their Home Resort. To make matters worse, the staff seemed to not really care. I put a call in to HGVC headquarters and pretty much got the runaround there, although they did make a courtesy call to the hotel. Nothing could be changed as they were fully booked. I do plan to write a formal letter to HGVC as well as the Lagoon Tower Board of Directors as I would like an answer, in writing, as to this Bait  Switch technique as the previous TripAdivsor member stated. Perhaps there is also a local Hawaiian or Florida consumer advocate that can explain the legitimacy of this policy.We have not changed our mind about Hawaii, though. We still enjoyed the beautiful island of Oahu and its people and culture. That is, after all, what we fell in love with from the beginning.

<Content>Give the buffet a miss at all costs! My mate and I spent the second week of our holiday in Oahu, staying at this hotel as part of a package. I was looking forward to it as Hilton has a good reputation and I'd recently had a reasonably happy stay at their hotel in Port of Spain. The grounds of the hotel with the endless fountains and waterfalls, roaming penguins and pink flamigoes are beautiful but the buildings themselves are nothing special. We were in the Diamond Head tower which looks like a council estate block of maisonettes from the exterior and the interior rather reminded me of a tired guesthouse in a British coastal town. The bathrooms are absolutely tiny and as other reviewers have noted, they charge for absolutely everything at this hotel. The charges for the umbrellas and deckchairs on the beach are outrageously high. The best restaurant is Bali by the sea which we had an excellent if very expensive meal at. However I do urge any readers to avoid the buffet in the hotel restaurant at all costs. It is overpriced and the quality of the food is very poor. The staff are rather unfriendly and slow. We were tricked into having the buffet by being told there wasn't a menu. This turned out to be a complete lie and we would have much rather ordered a la carte. We didn't eat there again after that. The breakfast buffet in the Tapa tower restaurant is also to be avoided as the food quality and choice is poor and as an example of the costs, they charge you for almost $6 for an orange juice from concentrate! We were never able to get on a deckchair by the pool as they were always full. This hotel is very much for honeymooners and families with small children so if like us you are young, single and looking for some fun, you should avoid this place.

<Content>You will have a Great Time here The Hilton Hawaiian Village is a great place to stay especially with kids.  I just returned from a trip over the 4th of July with my 6 yr old son, 14 yr old niece, mom and stepdad. We stayed in the Ali'i Tower. It was awesome. We had a fantastic view of the super pool and part of the beach from our room. Even with a child and a teenager sharing a room with me we had plenty of space and the bathroom was very large and compartmentalized so that it could be used by multiple persons at the same time without problem. Even though this tower had extra amenities I don't think you'd miss them much staying in any other of the towers. We weren't in the room enough to really use them and all the towers are beautiful. However the availability of a concierge was very helpful in getting us a dinner reservation at a specific time that I was unable to get calling the restaurant directly. That was pretty cool.The entire place is open and airy and just way cool. I have traveled a lot and my mom and stepdad are very avid travelers. They were very surprised with the hotel and loved it.If you want that tropical Hawaiian feeling this is the place. Huge pools, great beach, friendly people and just unbelievable grounds with ponds and wildlife just hanging out. You can't go wrong with this hotel if you want a fun vacation.PS: But you must make a side trip and visit Kailua on the windward or south east coast. The best beach I've ever been to and you have to eat at Teddy Burger. Oh what I'd do for a Teddy Burger, yummy!You will have a great time so go!

<Content>Bait and switch We are HVC owners of a two bedroom unit in the Lagoon Towers. We waited a whole year to reserve what we thought was the same layout of a 2 bedroom ocean view unit with a double balcony that they showed us three years ago. Mind you this is why we feel in love with the place and bought here because of the spaciousness of that type of unit.But on this recent July 2006 trip, we were given two rooms-- a regular hotel room with an ajacent smaller 1 bedroom unit. When we complained about this we were told that when we booked we should have specified that we did not want a room that had the hotel type of lockout rooms or in other words, two rooms that you often find in hotel situations when you want to put two rooms together.  The HVC personnel here said that these two rooms put together equalled a 2 bedroom unit. In our opinion, IT DID NOT meet with what we thought we bought and were going to get on this trip. Don't fall for this bait and switch tactic.These unit cost a lot of money to buy and the sales people should show you every room configuration that you are entitled to at the time of purchase so you know exactly what you'll be getting when you arrive on your vacation and won't be disappointed.Since we now know about this detail that was not openly and honestly discussed during our initial purchase, we wanted to share this information for anyone who's thinking of getting a big two bedroom unit there. Make sure you get the room configuration that you think your getting.Otherwise, the Hilton is a great place to stay if you can avoid all the timeshare yah dah yah dah they want you to hear about.

<Content>Too Crowded  My girlfriend and I just spent a week at the Hilton Hawaiian Village where we had a spacious room overlooking the ocean from the 23rd floor of the Tapa Tower. Honolulu would not ordinarily be our choice for a Hawaiian vacation since we are not fans of crowds, traffic, high-rises and tour busses when on vacation, but I was attending a conference at the nearby convention center for part of the week and the Hilton was the official convention hotel which tells you a bit about the overall ambience of the place.I had to laugh at the comments from other writers who were so impressed by the shopping opportunities 鈥?and, rest assured there are many. But for the expense and the time it takes to get to Hawaii from just about anywhere, it seems to me that the shoppers would be better off going to New York or Chicago or the Mall of America. The Hilton was completely sold-out while we were there which was apparent by how crowded the beach was. As other writers have noted, the Hilton charges you for everything imaginable including the use of beach chairs and shade umbrellas. So we went to a nearby grocery store and bought a couple of folding beach chairs for about $20 apiece. Particularly if you intend to drive around and explore some other beaches (which I strongly recommend), this is the way to go.Other than the crowded conditions and the charges for everything, the only other negative aspect of the beach was that the water was somewhat cloudy 鈥?not the beautiful crystalline water characteristic of the Caribbean. I suspect that this is due to the surface run-off which occurs around cities or otherwise caused by 鈥渄evelopment鈥? We were relieved to find that the water was clearer at some of the beaches in less 鈥渄eveloped鈥?areas a short drive up the coast past the Diamond Head volcano. Many of these beaches have great waves a bit closer to shore for surfing or body surfing.The beach itself in front of the Hilton is wide and, except for a few patches of gravel, the sand is soft and beautiful - although it always saddens us to see the amount of trash and litter people leave about 鈥?even cigarette butts on a 鈥渘on-smoking鈥?beach. But by far the best aspect of the beach was the utter lack of jet skis. In our experience, nothing can wreck the character of a lovely beach like the noise, mayhem and pollution that results from waverunner concessions. In fact, we were delighted to have seen very few of these insidious machines around any of the beaches we visited. Perhaps Hawaii has wisely banned them from most of its shoreline.We hiked the Manoa Waterfall hike one day which took about an hour (round trip at a moderate pace) through a lush and cool rainforest which was enjoyable although the Manoa Waterfall was anti-climactic. The 鈥渨aterfall鈥?was really more of a trickle into a small pool that was roped off with signs discouraging swimming (so don鈥檛 be fooled by the brochures). The little pool of water at the base of the 鈥渨aterfall鈥?was really too small to swim or even wade in. Maybe if the area had gotten more rain preceding our visit, the Manoa Waterfall would have been a different experience.The number of good restaurants in and around the Hilton was a highlight and, if you are a seafood lover, you couldn鈥檛 ask for much more in the way of variety or freshness. We had dinner one night at Bali by the Sea which is on the property. The food was good but overpriced. We liked Orchids (in the Halekulani Hotel a short walk down the beach) better. One of the best values we found was the Thai restaurant across the street from the Hilton.Finally, like other writers, we were completely turned-off by the nickel and diming at the hotel. The petty charges for everything is more egregious than I have ever seen before - $2.50 for the tiny bottles of water in your room, $ for in-room coffee if you have more than one pot and it goes on and on. Due to my Hhonors status, the front desk gave us coupons for a complimentary continental breakfast each morning. But for breakfast to actually be complimentary, we were limited to a muffin that had to be served to us by a waiter. If, instead of a muffin, we wanted to go to the cold buffet and get a single bowl of raison bran or a cup of yogurt 鈥?well that is an upgrade for which Hilton will charge you $3.50.All-in-all, if it were our money and choice (versus my employer鈥檚) we would have found a less crowded and commercialized place to spend a week in Hawaii.

<Content>We had a great time! I recently stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for 9 nights--and it was great. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to an ocean front room in the Rainbow Tower--we could see the show at the pool, Diamond Head, and the Ocean from the balcony. The staff were very helpful--the woman who checked us in gave us advice on restaurants (outside of the resort) and where to go on the Island.The pool did seem crowded--but the beach wasn't too crowded....which is where we spent most of our time while we were at the HIlton. Parking was 16 dollars a day, but it was worth it! We rented a jeep and spent a lot of time at the North Shore. The room was pretty large compared to many hotels and the service was excellent. It was also nice to have a wet bar and mini-refrigerator--that way we didn't have to go to restaurants for every meal. We did have to wait for an elevator a few times, but it was not a big deal.Overall, we had a fabulous time at this hotel and would recommend it to anyone going to Oahu. We plan to to stay here again...

<Content>Great stay Booked an oceanview room and got one in the Rainbow tower with an excellent view of the beach, the superpool and diamonhead. The bed faces the sliding door so if you leave it open at night, you could wake up to a beautiful view of the ocean in the morning. Overall an execellent resort for relaxationComplaints...Everything is pricey here and had a bad experience looking for a decent place to dine after 8pm; one restaurant (Bali by the Sea or somehting like that) requires guys to wear long pants - come on, this is a beach resort!Superpool closes at 6pm - even a motel leaves it's pool open until 10pm! At $300 over for a night's stay, you would certainly expect to use the pool for longer...Too few trees on the beach - guess they do this intentionally to increase the beach umbrella business..Mandara Spa - SKIP IT!!!! had I read an earlier review, I wouldn't have paid $400 for an 80min Lomi Lomi massage session for me and my wife. Place is totally overrated and overpriced. Don't expect that you are paying for the atmosphere etc. The only nice deco is in the massage waiting area where everyone sits around in their robes staring at one another...and then you walk into a tiny room which is basically 4 walls with no aethetics (no shower room in the massage suite, so couples like us have to separate and go to the separate men/ladies shower areas of the gym)...and the therapists have no smiles on their faces, the massages were mediocre and o yes, the massage doesn't include the chest and abs areas...I've paid $100 (for 2) for a similar massage on Bali (yes, yes, Bali is cheap) but the massage area is in a cabana by the beach with herbal tea after the treatment, your own private shower area and the entire experience was wonderful. For Mandara Spa, we walked feeling that we we had been cheated.

<Content>Marvelous Hotel We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Vilage in the Ali'i Tower for 8 glorious days. The hotel was everything we expected and more. From the complimentary bottled water in the room to the complimentary full continental breakfast, this hotel is an outstanding example of value as well as service and luxury for your dollar. The hotel is clean, lovely, and inviting. The location is awesome and the Village eliminates the need for a car or expensive taxis. Moreover, the prices are fair and one is not nickeled and dimed. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone. There are abundant choices for couples, kids, seniors, etc. The entertainment at night is great and there are several choices. There are so many restaurant options from casual to elegant within walking distance that it would take several weeks to exhaust them. Of course during the day one has the pool, fitness center, tours, and beach activities. Additionally, the Ali'i Tower has its own quick beach access, its own wonderful pool with food/drink service, and its own fitness center. All in all, this is a marvelous choice.

<Content>Great Stay--Free Room! Wow! What else can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? Its all true--a magical village in the heart of Wakiki! The whole experience was made even better by the price--free!!!!! We used Hilton Honor Points and got 6 free nights, including free breakfast coupons! But wait--even better--since we're Diamond members they upgraded us to an executive king corner suite, Rainbow Tower, Ocean View--huge suite with 2 bathroooms! The rack rate for that room was $790/nt! They even sent up a welcome fruit basket! Any more and they'd be paying us to stay there! It was better than winning a contest!Even if you have to pay for a room here, its worth it!

<Content>$8.25 Beer!!! Hidden Costs!! Very nice grounds, easy to check in and out. Our room was clean and decent in the Diamond Head Tower. They screwed up the 鈥減aid in full鈥?reservation of the other couple we went with, but gave them a nice room in the Rainbow Tower. Unfortunately, they were on the 30th floor, and the elevators there do not work well. Not a great beach outside, due to large rocks in the water which barricade it. You have to walk about 200 yards to get to the beach that has small shorebreaker waves, and doesn't have rocky sand which hurts your feet. The rental hut the hotel owns on the beach wanted $100 for 4 beach chairs and 2 umbrellas. That will cost you 1/4 of the price at the next hut over. In fact, the rest of the hotel is the same way. $100 for the coffee shop buffet for 4 people (buffet eggs and bacon), and $76 for dinner for 2 there. The drinks are $8-$13 all over, and the sushi place Hatsuhana was so bad, they used a butane fueled torch to make baked scallop sushi roll (it tasted as bad as it sounds). For a second I thought the price of sushi was a good deal, only $4, but that is only for one piece. The problem with the hotel is you're stuck there, it's so big. Just getting to a coffee shop on the street is a good walk. I had 2 massages there, they couldn't even be honest about the price. They said it was $98, but then they have a service charge of $15, and you'd feel bad if you didn't give the person a tip on top of it. I decided to have the massages, becuase it was going to be $20 anyway for me just to use the gym, which is included with a massage. Don't bother renting a car and keeping it overnight, that will cost you $30/day to park there. Bottom line, Honolulu doesn鈥檛 have the luxury to keep charging these prices, the city is starting to look like Los Angeles (with freeways and all), and the beach isn鈥檛 much better than Santa Monica鈥檚. The reef looks dead to me. If you鈥檙e looking at this hotel, ask yourself, why am I going to Honolulu and not Maui/Kauai or the big island? We had free airline tickets, so Honolulu was fine for us, but I felt bad for the other couple we went with, who did pay for their tickets.

<Content>Customers come second My family and I stayed in a very expensive suite in the Lagoon towers. There were three elevators, but during daytime hours, one was always keyed for hotel workers. Consequently, the elevator wait was anywhere from three to eight minutes with several guests having to wait for the next elevator due to no space available. The parking structure was several floors, with all lower and forward spaces, convienient to the hotel, reserved for the valet staff and employees. The main pool, advertised as one of the islands largest, was open from 830am to 530pm. If you did not arrive at 8am and stand in line, there were no seats available the remainder of the day. My family and I never got to sit at the pool. Of course beach chairs were available for $12 dollars each. The room was nice and the shops were nice, but if you plan to shop in downtown Honolulu, plan on taking a cab. The Hawaiian Village is approximately 2 miles from the center of town where all the best shopping and restaurant activity is centered.

<Content>Nice place to stay in Waikiki! If you want to be a part of it all, this is the place!We spent the first four nights of our honeymoon (June 24-28) in the Tapa Tower. We really liked the location of the Tapa Tower in the HHV - it was close to both pools, the entrance, Rainbow Bazaar, etc...The Superpool was not so super... don't be alarmed, it's a nice-sized pool, just not big enough to service all the zillions of guests million around the grounds. We had a hard time getting a spot near the pool all four days - to the point we had to rent chairs in front of the Hale Koa next door ($30/day, not bad w/ umbrella) if we wanted to sit in chairs, not on the ground. So, we sat at the beach - worked out well, but we really wanted to be poolside that morning. Oh well, we hung loose! :)We tried to rent a car at the Hertz in the HHV, but that really didn't materialize - the desk is supposed to open at 7:30 - we were there - but the attendent didn't show up until 8:05. We tried to get ANY car available, but they told us they didn't have any. We were sad, but knew we should have reserved one, but the HHV concierge ended up calling some places, he found us a Geo Tracker for $35.99 at VIP cars. Seriously, it was really banged up, but we fit in with the surfers on the North Shore, so we weren't concerned about getting robbed at all! :) The room was nice - we were upgraded from partial to full ocean view - great touch - and we loved it. It was great, nice linens, nice bed, nothing to complain about at all!The HHV is a nice property on Waikiki. Sure, it's pricey, but you need to try to get over it quickly or you won't be able to enjoy your trip - HAWAII is expensive! Not sure if we'll go back. I think we both felt like we didn't need to go back to Oahu, but if we did, I think we'd go somewhere a little less busy!

<Content>Awesome Week in Oahu! My husband and I just returned from celebrating our one-year wedding anniversary in Oahu. After careful consideration and a LOT of research, we chose the HHV due to the location and great reviews. We checked in on June 30th, expecting to be put in the Tapa Tower since we only paid for a generic Garden View room. Much to my delight, we were upgraded to the Ali'i Tower. The room we had in the Ali'i Tower was awesome! The bedroom itself was huge and the bed was so comfortable with it's high thread count sheets and down comforter. What I loved best was the gigantic bathroom that had a little tv on the vanity! Our rooms were cleaned everyday by 1pm at the very latest. Overall, the HHV was a very nice, relaxing place to stay. We never ran into the people selling timeshares and always found the staff to be very nice. The resort is big but it's not TOO big. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants but we did order a Roundtable pizza and some of their garlic parmesan twists which were FABULOUS! My only complaint is the price of drinks...$20 for 2 pina coladas! I thought that was ridiculous but expected it. Buy beer and stuff from the ABC store...oh, and before you go buy a bunch of junk from Hilo Hattie, check out the ABC store. The same candy, wooden trinkets, and other little things were cheaper at the ABC store. We will definitely return to Oahu and the HHV!For those looking for a Pearl Harbor Tour, we did the Home of the Brave Tour which you can view at [---]. My husband and I both agree that the tour was our favorite thing! Olav-our guide-knew his history and he was fascinating to listen to. They pick you up at 6am and we were the 2nd group to get to go onto the memorial. We also got to visit several other places that were crucial on that day and we even had lunch at an old Officers Club. It's a long day (back by 2pm) but you will have a wonderful time if you like history! On a food note, if you go to Duke's at the Outrigger and you like to eat fish, try the Opah with the Macadamia Nut/Parmesan crust. It's out of this world...and I don't normally like fish! Eggs  Things is good but go EARLY...before 8am if you don't want to wait an hour. Wailana Coffee House is good, too. If you're interested in trying surfing, walk down the beach towards Diamond Head and you can get surf lessons/rentals cheaper than at the HHV. My husband surfed 3 times and now he's hooked :)Also, if you're looking for transportation to/from the airport, DON'T use VIP Transportation. We found them to be quite unreliable, especially when we were heading back to the airport. Aloha!

<Content>Definitely Paradise This was our first trip to Hawaii and we could not have chosen a better place to stay. The 1-bedroom apartment was spacious and tastefully decorated. Hardwood floors in living, dining, and full-size kitchen area. The grounds are breathtaking. It's truly like staying in an Hawaiian village. Plenty of shopping and dining on the grounds but lots more within walking distance. Trolley, bus and tour services were very convenient. Service was outstanding from the local people; would encourage those who have relocated to adapt the Hawaiian way. Would highly recommend.

<Content>Rainbow Tower at HHV is #1 to any other hotel on the beach! We stayed for 2 weeks at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, and I must say that we were not disappointed one bit. The staff is cheerful and very attentive, and our view of Diamond Head Crater and the Pacific Ocean from our balcony was truly a gorgeous way to start and end each day.The Good?:1- Staff is extra friendly.2- Property Grounds show like a postcard. Gorgeous landscaping!The Bad?:1- Bring your own COFFEE! Each bag in the room is $3.95 to your bill!2- Watch your step on the beach. Not all sand is natural and some is very sharp!3- On-site shops are majority designer (i.e.-Coach, Louie Vuitton, etc. and very $$$$!) If you are looking for a cheaper souviner T-Shirt, go off property.4- On-site restaurants are plentiful but once again very expensive!5- 4TH OF JULY WARNING! --- RAINBOW TOWER! The resort sets off the best 4th of July show on the island. However, if you are staying in the Rainbow Tower and facing the pool  Diamond Head, you will NOT be able to see it. Go down to the beach or make friends with someone who has a view of the Marina!

<Content>Absolutely paradise We just returned from our vacation at the HHV. My husband, son, daughter-in-law, and I stayed for 7 nights in the Rainbow Tower at Hilton Hawaiian Village. Beautiful place!! Staff is awesome!! We, as visitors, had to keep going down to the information desk in the main lobby to obtain help with travel plans. Staff would go out of their way to help. They would suggest cheaper, safer modes of transportation (other than taxi). Any encounter with staff was excellent, whether it be the maids, busboys, reservation desk, waitresses, etc. Everyone was very helpful. Our room had an awesome view of the ocean and the city lights of Honolulu. We were upgraded from a deluxe oceanfront king to a corner oceanfront king room. Room was beautiful with modern amenities. Complaints are: only one free 4-cup coffee pot of coffee per day, expensive food (except for CJ's and Round Table Pizza). All food was good, though. Oftentimes, we'd just go to ABC Store in the hotel and get sandwiches, chips, milk, and muffins for breakfast and lunch. Whenever we'd have to call for towels, more cream/sugars (Hawaiian coffee is strong), staff was very pleasant and would accomodate us promptly. They would not hear of us coming down to get things. They always brought them to us and never had a hand out!! We really enjoyed that! All in all, great resort and we'll return if ever in Oahu!!

<Content>Hawaiian Oasis We stayed at the Kalia Tower at Hilton Hawaiian Village from 6/19 - 6/24 in a one bedroom condominium and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. This is our third stay there in 18 months and even though the beachfront Waikiki hotels such as the Outrigger make us sometimes wish we were smack in the heart of Waikiki, we always fall back to the less-crowded and more laid-back atmosphere at the Hilton. Besides, it's only a 20 minute walk to Waikiki. The key to staying at the Hawaiian Village and not overloading your credit cards is to enjoy window shopping there but buying elsewhere. Likewise with the onsite restaurants which tend to be pricey. A few exceptions -- Lapperts Ice Cream is a must, CJ's Deli and the Noodle place are fairly reasonable. What I like most about the place is that I can meander down to the spacious airy lobbies and listen to music without necessarily having to sit at the bars and actually have a choice to have a swinging time or go for a quiet retreat. There's hawaiian entertainment by the pool at around 6pm and the American Express Travelers Activities center is full of knowledgeable people who actually try to save you money. They saved my husband $100 by suggesting he drive our rental car to one of the many golf courses around -- look for a threesome in need of a 4th, rather than using one of their package deals. Ala Moana shopping center is a few minutes away by foot (probably quicker that way vs a car during rush-hour traffic). Accomodations were superb--clean and new (except for a leaky kitchen faucet). One warning--don't use their Mandara spa which is over-priced all the way around (and unremarkable in their service) --including charges to use their steam room and exercise facilities. If you want a massage, look up the Shiatsu and Massage Center on Lihue street--nothing to look at--(you'll be face-down anyway) but a great massage at 1/3 the price! Downside for boogie boarders -- unless you wake up really early, you're better off catching the waves in front of the Outrigger. Besides, they nickel and dime you for the umbrellas, chairs, etc. oceanside at the Hilton. Buy a straw mat at the ABC stores for a dollar instead. Some of the staff are downright rude--but get their name and report them. Otherwise, this is definitely a favorite place for us in terms of luxury and location.

<Content>Could have been better My wife and I purchased points from Hilton Vacation Club and cashed them in on a week's stay at the Lagoon Tower at Hilton Hawiian Village. We brought our 12 yr. old twins and signed up (9 mos in advance) for a 2 bedroom condo. We arrived to find the second bedroom to be a studio style with only one bed - when we were expecting 2. A look out the balcony window showed that we were facing the construction of a new Hilton tower - construction noise and all from 8AM to 5PM, M-F. It looked like they had just broken ground. Our room was also next to the elevators - something I don't seek out due to noise. I asked the manager if they could do something to improve our room and she told me that I would be put on a waiting list to be moved. Needless to say, after 7 nights stay they never changed our room. I felt like I was getting lip service and no action. Water pressure in the shower was extremely low, sometimes down to a trickle. To the hotel's credit, the rooms were nicely appointed and the kitchen had all the conveniences. The grounds were nicely kept and the stores and restaurants on the grounds were convenient. I didn't like the idea of missing out on a pool chair if you didn't get there by 8AM. Staking out chairs and leaving towels to reserve seating seems so petty. Parking seemed a little steep at $16, but at least we had in and out privilages. I would recommend the Sat. dinner buffet at the Linai (?) restaurant at the hotel. In the end we ended up joining the HGVC hoping that this was an isolated incident and that we would expect or seek out better accommodations next time (elsewhere).

<Content>Excellent location and service Our family of five stayed here in mid-June '06 for a week. We were in two rooms in the new tower, Kalia (2048/2050), with a mountain view. The rooms were beautiful and exceptionally clean. Service was always excellent and friendly. The location was perfect for us: the kids were able to access the pools and beach in a hurry and we were somewhat away from the hustle of Waikiki. Even though we got a mountain view room to save some nickles, the view was great, and included a nice angle on Diamodhead. Overall, this was an excellent hotel for us and we'd stay there again without hesitation. Aloha.

<Content>Stay at the Sheraton The positive is that the room was spacious, clean and new - I stayed in the Kahlia Tower, one of 5 towers surrounding the Hawaiian Village. I was on the executive level - advertised to provide  additional amenities offered in the Lanikai Executive Lounge include concierge services, assistance with business needs, large-screen television, newspaper/periodical rack, self-serve espresso, as well as continental breakfast, mid-day refreshments and evening hors d'oeuvres. Continental breakfast included fruit (no bananas for four of my seven days), sweet pastries, four types of boxed cereal, bread for toasting and either orange or guava juice. Since i don't drink coffee (more on that later), I asked for a diet coke. I was told that I could only have soda in the afternoon and that I could not take any soda or food (like an apple) out of the area to my room. Mid day refreshments were Doritos in a bowl with some canned salsa, cookies, scones and strawberries. Evening hors d'oeuvres consisted of either tiny shrimp quiches and beef satay, or burnt potstickers and lumpia, with raw veggies, ranch dressing, same Doritos and salsa and some cheese and crackers. And they close at 8:00 pm with food depleted by about 7:00, so no relaxing in the evening with friends or family.The Hawaiian Village is really nothing more than a shopping center catering to the Japanese tourists. In fact, your room television has eight channels devouted to telling you about the shopping in both english and japanese. The property is overcrowded, the reception area cannot handle the check-in process quickly, the check-in people at Kahlia tower were unhelpful, unfriendly and when I mentioned that the ethernet cable in my room did not work, they just shrugged their shoulders and gave me a different one to plug in, saying that if it didn't work, they might be able to get me a different room, but they weren't sure. Fortunately, I was able to attach to the wireless network - for the hefty sum of $65.00 for my week's stay. It was not super fast, but it was acceptable.Parking is $16/day (valet for $19.00). Two beach Chairs (plastic pvc with no cushion) and an umbrella will cost you $51/day not including the tip for the beach guy to dig a hole for the umbrella and you have to wait in line each day for that priviledge. Coffee in the room (they have a coffee maker) costs you $3.75 for each package of coffee you use. Tiny 6 ounce bottles of water cost you $2.50 and even though you have no choice, the room safe in the closet costs $3.75 whether you use it or not. The super pool is small, crowded and over-rated - with long lines to get towels and chairs. The beach is nice, but crowded and trashy by the end of the week. I think they only clean it once a week. The staff was indifferent and sometimes rude.I usually stay at one of the SSheraton, whcih are a little more expensive - but in the long run, they don't knicle and dime you to death and are a lot nicer to deal with. They even give yo a welcome lei at teh Sheraton - nothing's free at the Hilton.

<Content>Fabulous! We stayed at the hotel complex from June 9 - 15 and it was fabulous! We escaped a bad hotel after a two-day stay, and the Hilton was happy to take us in at a moment's notice. We were lucky enough to get a room on the club floor of The Kalia Tower, with included heavy snacks all day in the club lounge on the 25th floor. The room was impeccable, and of course the property has no equal. Service was great in this tower, with its own check in, concierge and pool. I even sat through a 90-minute presentation from the HIlton Vacation Club, and was given $150 in gift certifcates in exchange for my time. We used that money for a spa treatment (which my daughter reports was heavenly) and a night out at Benihana right there on the property. The HHV is busy with tourists, but has everything you could ever need right there. This was our third stay there, and we will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful hotel - Kalia Tower is great I attended a friend's wedding at the HHV, and the majority of the wedding guests were put up at the Kalia Tower. We loved it. Kalia has its own swimming pool - a bonus because the main pool (Super Pool) gets very crowded and it's quite hard to find a lounge chair after 8:30 a.m. The Kalia pool is small, quiet, has a poolside bar, and if you pay to use the fitness center at Kalia you will not only have access to a great gym (good cardio and weights machines) but you'll be able to use the Mandara Spa facilities too. The steam room, hot tub and sauna are all well kept.I had a king room with a mountain view. The twice daily turndown service was a treat - how nice to come home to orchids on your pillow each day. Another nice feature of the room was the small refrigerator in the bathroom (separate from the minibar) that I was able to use to store fresh fruit, snacks  beer, which I bought at the ABC Store next to the hotel.The reviewer who said they had poor service must have been an exception to the rule. I received nothing but the best service during my entire stay. I was able to request a late checkout at 4pm without any problems. Also, Kalia is one of the towers that offers luggage storage. This was all very convenient since my flight was not until 10pm.I did not eat at any of the HHV restaurants, simply because I was able to find better value off the resort. Eggs N Things breakfast place around the corner (not the one across the street!) is excellent -- wonderful service, delicious food. Also, a tip for buying souvenirs -- go to the Walmart behind Ala Moana Shopping Center. The boxes of chocolate covered mac nuts that you find in ABC Stores for $5/box are only $3/box at Walmart.

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian Village Everything you have seen written about the Ali'i Tower is true. It's a fabulous tower, with excellent service, and if you're already forking over the dollars to travel to Hawaii, and stay at HHV, why not spend a few extra to really enjoy the time you spend on Oahu.Here are some money savers when it comes to food, whether you are traveling with children, or just aren't looking to take a 2nd mortgage to fund your trip.The Maui Revealed guide book ( available in book stores) is the best...their tip was to walk next door to the Hale Koa hotel. While you must be military to stay there, anyone can use their restaurants. If you're at the HHV pool and looking for a burger or hot dog mid-day, you can spend $7.95 for ONE hot dog at HHV, or $14 for the cheeseburger basket, or take a 2 minute walk from the HHV Super Pool onto the beach path, and immediately turn onto the Hale Koa grounds, follow the path a few steps and on your left is a snack bar the has hot dogs for $2.55 ( good ones) fries for $1.50, and even a 3 piece chicken plate for $4. It adds up in savings quickly.Also, if you don't want to pay $21.95 for the breakfast buffet at HHV, just take a 3 minute walk to Wailana Coffee Shop, just off property, and you'll get great food, decent prices ( all you can eat pancakes, with eggs, bacon for $5.25).The best part of HHV is the beach ( lots of sand), the grounds ( tropical paradise) and the Ali'i Tower.The rest of Waikiki is crowded, like Vegas strip on a beach, and some resorts have very little or no beach at all.But, rent a car and see the island, especially Lanikai Beach and Kailua Beach--powder sand and a whole different feel than Waikiki.Avoid the shuttle on Waikiki. If you want you can take the free Hilo Hattie shuttle ( to their 2 stores) which also passes by the hotels on Waikiki, and you get a free tour of downtown Honolulu. Hilo Hattie shutle picks up at HHV bus area every 20 minutes.Aloha, and enjoy your trip!

<Content>A great place! We arrived in Honolulu and had Aloha Limo service pick us up. They met us at baggage claim and gave each of us a beautiful, fresh flower lei and a souvenir coffee mug and we were off to the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I had originally booked the Lagoon Tower so we were dropped off there. When we went to check in, we found out that we had been moved to the Kalia Tower with no explanation. However, they assured us that is was their newest tower, indicating that maybe it was the nicest. We later discovered it was built in 2001. The Kalia Tower was a fairly long walk away from our drop off location. No one offered to take our bags although I鈥檓 sure, had we been willing to wait, someone might have. We then checked into our ocean-view, one bedroom condo at Kalia which also had a beautiful view of the 鈥渧illage鈥? It was very nice with a small living room with a sleeper sofa and balcony and full kitchen. The bedroom was pretty with a very comfortable king size bed and balcony. The only problem was we only had one bathroom which was a little inconvenient when we and our daughters (ages 7 and 12) were trying to get showered and ready for dinner each night. Since we never saw a condo at the Lagoon Tower and therefore couldn鈥檛 compare it, we were very happy with where we were. The walk was long to the pool and beach each day but entertaining as we walked by shops, birds, flamingos and penguins each time. I had hoped to cook breakfast or lunch in our room a couple of days while we were there but didn鈥檛 find much to offer in the ABC convenience store on the property. The day before we left to come home, we found the 鈥淲haler鈥檚 General Store鈥?(I think that was the name of it) near the Diamond Head Tower. It was not crowded and had a lot more to choose from as far as general staples for breakfast and lunch.We ate breakfast each morning, except one, at the Rainbow Tower Lanai buffet. It was VERY good but also very expensive. Although my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed each meal there, my daughters usually only ate a bowl of cereal and maybe a little fruit so it would have been much more cost effective had we eaten in our room! Each day for lunch, we ate by the pool. They have great pizza and 鈥渧olcano鈥?french fries! And after 3:00 they serve chicken fingers. For dinner during the week, we at Sergio鈥檚 鈥揺xcellent Italian food, The Village Steak and Seafood Restaurant 鈥揳nother excellent meal(located in the Tapa Tower) Benihana鈥檚 鈥?a disappointment, and the Tropic Bar-our kids favorite(located next to the Super Pool). And one night we walked off the property to The Outback located a couple of blocks away so that our kids could finally have something they like to eat. It seemed that most of the restaurants in the village did not have a lot to offer as far as a 鈥渒id鈥檚 meal鈥? The Village Steak and Seafood Restaurant probably had the most to offer for kids out of the restaurants we ate at. We also ate breakfast at their buffet one of the mornings but it didn鈥檛 have as much to offer as the Rainbow Lanai.The village has several pools. We spent a little time at the pool at the Kalia Tower (for Kalia guests only). The pool is small and is about 4 feet deep (almost over my 7 year old鈥檚 head) and they also have a hot tub. The Tapa Pool is nice and allows small floats and is open until 10:00 p.m. unlike the other pools. Our favorite pool was the Super Pool and seemed to be everyone else鈥檚 favorite as well. It opens at 8:30 and we had to be in line no later than 8:15 to get towels and a chair. By 8:45 there would be no chairs available until about 3:00 in the afternoon. Also you can only save your chairs for 45 minutes. The employees mark them with a card and if you do not return within 45 minutes your chairs will be given to someone else. This was rather exhausting. If we wanted to go to the pool, we couldn鈥檛 sleep in and enjoy our vacation 鈥?we had to be on a schedule and get to the pool by 8:00, stand in line, get our chairs at 8:30, go eat breakfast hurriedly all the while wondering if someone was going to take our chairs while we were gone. Hopefully we were just there at a busy time of year (first week of June)and maybe it鈥檚 not typically that way. We did spend one day at the beach but although it was beautiful, we all seemed to prefer the pool. And if you don鈥檛 get in line by 8:15 to rent your chairs for the beach, you don鈥檛 get on the 鈥渇ront row鈥?One day we took a break from the pool and beach and rented a jeep from Hertz (which is conveniently located on the property) and toured the island 鈥?breathtaking! All in all it was a great vacation and a trip of a lifetime spent at a very nice resort. I would definitely recommend it to any one, with or without kids

<Content>Poor service We stayed from 6/7/07-6/11/06. We encountered several, unresolved problems during our stay. Overall, extremely poor service. : 1) tub handle was broken (could not control water temp): reported and took 2 days to be fixed2) A/C-could not control temp: no matter what temp you set it at, it blew constant, cold air. Reported and not fixed. 3) Phone voicemail light not operating: only found out about emergency call because we accidentally ran into the person who left a message. Otherwise we would have missed our return shuttle to the airport. 4) called 3 consecutive days for a wake-up call (once spoke to a person, twice left an automated message): did not receive a call on any day. 5) was charged for a mini-bar fee (charge was made to our Am Ex account when we got home): there was no mini-bar in our room. This was reported on check-in and no mini-bar was ever delivered to our room. I spoke with property rep when I got home and she issued a credit to our Am Ex. 6) Called front desk on several occasions: no answer despite trying at various times throughout the day. 7) clock in room was set incorrectly (type of clock that you must disassemble to reset) upon check-in: clock was replaced with another clock that was also set at incorrect time and was therefore unusable as an alarm clock.

<Content>Great Hotel My family and I went to the Hilton Hawaiian Village during spring break 2005. I must say it was an excellent trip. Not only did we meet the cast of the T.V. show LOST once, we met them twice. The first time we saw them was the night of the last episode with one of the male castmembers (the brother of the pretty blonde girl). The cast wasa celebrating with a dinner at the five star Golden Dragon restaurant. Other than the celebrities, the animals and scenery was MAGNIFICENT. Oh, and I almost forgot! Watch your children in the ocean, because while we were there, a japanese man nearly drowned in the ocean, and if it wasnt for my parents and a few nurses on vacation, he surely would have drowned. And the lifeguard.....he was too far away to even know there was a drowning person. He finally showed up right as the paramedics arrived. The hotel treated us right when they found out we helped save that man's life. I reccomend this resort to anyone visiting Honolulu!

<Content>Wonderful stay at the HVV We stayed in the Ali'i Tower for six nights.Our room was on the 15th floor partial ocean view overlooking the super pool. The Ali'i tower has its own hot tub and pool overlooking the ocean. Never had a problem getting a chair by the pool. You have to use your key to get in this private pool area. Also by the pool they offer free hor'derves nightly between 5-7. They also provide very good bar and food service by the pool.Our room was large and everything looked very new.Very comfortable beds. We were provided robes and slippers and the first day we had a complimentary fresh friut plate. The coffee, tea and water were at no charge. The maid service came three times a day. (Clean up, ice, turn down service.) If this is too much you can put out thedo not disturb  sign. The last day we checked out at 12:00 and they kept our luggage at the Diamond Head tower and at 3:00 they gave us a hospitality room to shower and change. These rooms were also very nice but I noticed they charged for the coffee, tea, and water in these rooms. Everything at the resort is expensive but it was a very nice atmosphere. Alot of people but we never waited in line or felt crowded. The resort has the nicest beach in Waikiki. Some of the other resorts had no beach at all. I would definetly stay there again. Information desk was very helpful. She offered us a timeshare review but was not pushy.On Friday nights they have a great poolside show and we watched it from our lanai and also fireworks in front of the Rainbow Tower.Travel tips: Wailana Coffee Shop is across the street good, inexpensive food . For a nice dinner Duke's at the Outrigger is very good. Make reservations.  Rent a car and forget the tours you can do it own your own easily.

<Content>Ali'i Tower spoiled us! We recently stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in the Ali'i Tower and it was absolutely the best hotel experience we've had in a long time. The pampering service is non-stop. The towels are refreshed several times a day, ice and beverages re-stocked, and turndown service each evening. The beds are very comfortable, the furnishings are in immaculate condition, and the rooms are spotless. The rooms are well planned and include a small sitting area, separate dressing area, and several options for storing your luggage and travel wear. There is even a mini tv in the dressing room. The amenities are first class and include complimentary hors d'oeuvres each evening on the pool terrace, newly renovated gym facilities, and concierge services. Plus you are only steps away from world famous Waikiki Beach. The landscaping of the HHV grounds and the various ponds of koi, and birds, including Penguins, are spectacular. The location is away from most of the beachwalk construction, so it is quiet, yet close to shopping and other Waikiki activity. The grounds and beaches are groomed daily and very clean. There are fairly calm and protected swimming areas right in front of the HHV, and several pools are available, including a private pool and spa just for Ali'i guests. Convenience items are easily available in the ABC store, and can easily be placed in your in-room mini fridge. There are many choices for onsite dining restaurant's, so you don't have to actually leave the village unless you want to. We ate brunch every day at CJ's Deli. Great service, good food and gigantic portions. You've got to try the Macadamia Nut pancakes with Cocoanut syrup! The HHV is like a small city, but laid out so well that you never really felt like you were in a crowd. It seems to offer something for everyone and we would definitely go back.

<Content>Wonderful time in Oahu My husband and I stayed at the HHV for 6 nights in early May. We loved it. I am a Hilton Gold member and they gave us a room in the Rainbow Tower which was great b/c it was closest to the pool and beach and had a wonderful view of the sunset from the balcony. The other tower that is close to beach/pool is Ali'i. I believe that tower also has concierge service and a private pool - requested to be there but it was apparently full. That's okay -we had no complaints in Rainbow. The resort is huge and it takes a bit to walk from place to place, but we are used to staying at big resorts and don't mind. I actually like it b/c there is more to do - more restaurants, shops, etc. The resort is also about a 15 minute walk from the most of the shops and restaurants in Waikiki, but it's a nice walk that you can do on the beach, and I liked that the location of this hotel was somewhat removed. Shopping is great in Waikiki though! As far as everyday items and soda/beer, you can purchase at the ABC shops - they are all over Waikiki and one right in the hotel. Many reviews mentioned that the restaurants in the HHV are very overpriced. The prices are similar to most resort restaurant prices. Being a Gold or Diamond member, you get free breakfast daily - we upgraded for $3.50 each to a buffet everyday, so that saved us a lot. Also, you may want to order the Entertainment book for Hawaii. There are 2 for 1 discounts in there for three of the restaurants at the hotel - Golden Dragon, Rainbow Lanai, and Villiage Steakhouse; also discounts for Polynesian Cultural Center and Luaus. We used the card at Golden Dragon and they were very receptive to it and it ended up being a great deal for dinner there. By the way - i would recommend that restaurant - it was very nice. We ate at Duke's Canoe Club 3 times. It is in the Outrigger about a 10 minute walk (to the left) down the beach. It's hard to get a table in the bar area, but it's a fun place with reasonably priced food and drinks (for Hawaii), so worth the wait. Sundays are especially a fun party atmosphere. We went to Chart House our last night before we caught our plane, and would recommend it there for cheap apps and drinks as well. It's to the right (when facing the beach) of the HHV about a 5 minute walk and there are views of the harbor. They have Happy Hour specials every night until 7pm. It gets a decent crowd in there - seems like a mostly local crowd. If you are a runner - Diamond head is within running distance - i think about 3.5 miles one way- but obviously quite hilly to get there. We ran there one morning, then hiked Diamond Head (1.8 miles round trip) and ran home - that was enough exercise for the entire trip for us.Actually, the only thing about our trip that i would NOT recommend is the Luau we went to at Germaine's. The bus took about 2 hours to get there and I was quite disappointed when we arrived. It was at a beach near an industrial park and you could either sit on the sand or on picnic benches and watch a second rate show. Soon after we arrived, they lined us up for the buffet line of fried chicken and pork and some other unappetizing salads, so right away I knew it wasn't going to be the romantic (or even fun) experience that I hoped for. Otherwise, the trip was awesome and can't wait to return to HHV.

<Content>Awesome This resort was the best part of my vacation. The staff was very friendly and somehow, I got upgraded to an oceanview room in the A'ali tower which was spectacular. There were down pillows on the soft bed and marble floors and bathroom. There was even a phone in the bathroom and a little tv on the dressing counter. It was everything I would expect from a resort of this caliber. The Mandara spa was gorgeous as were the grounds of the property. Everything was spotless. I did not find the shops to be overly expensive. After all, they weren't selling t-shirts from street vendors. The food, however, was quite expensive, but there were little cafe's that weren't quite as much. It is very convenient to have everything right in the resort and you always have the option of leaving the resort to venture out for dinner somewhere else. All the shuttles and trolleys stop here so that is convenient as well. If I ever travel back to Honolulu/Oahu, this would be the only place I would stay.

<Content>Mucho dineros The location of the Hilton Hawaiian Village on the Pacific Ocean is spectacular, as is the tropical landscaping, and numerous high-end shops and restaurants are clustered around the half-dozen hotel towers. However, the rooms (starting at $300 per night US) are average in quality and the housekeeping is unreliable. Entering our room for the first time, we found breakfast cereal bits in the bar sink and fluff on the floor. My brother-in-law, the manager of an international restaurant chain, looked from his room on to an ashphalt roof featuring underwear and a t-shirt left (presumably) by a previous guest. Daily items are costly: a packet of coffee in the room is $3.50, a standard-brand US beer by the pool is $7.50, and two standard coffees in paper cups (pour 'em yerself) plus a small square of dry cake is $10.50 by the pool, with no extra charge for unsmiling, dismissive service. The only way to enjoy the experience is to surrender and watch the dollars fly from your wallet.

<Content>A Good Family Property...if you keep Service Expectations in Check My wife and I travelled to Hawaii with our 2 sons (7 and 10 yrs old) over spring break. We were looking for a family oriented hotel with a good sized beach and chose the HHV. My expectations were low going in given the size of the property and what I thought would be a very mass market nature to it. I was in fact surprised on the upside in a number of areas.I'll break my review up into 4 areas:1. Room2. Facilities3. Restaurants4. ServiceROOM/LOCATION - AVERAGEWe stayed in the Tapa Tower (for the most part, the farthest wing from the beach - 2 minute walk!). The room was fairly unremarkable, double beds, TV, etc. and a balony. Bed was nice and firm, pillows fluffy, elevators fast. For the most part, we didn't spend much time in the room, so the fact that it was a pretty standard room wasn't a big deal. The one disappointment was room service. Given the size of the property, I probably shouldn't have been surprised, but on a rainy evening, we were told that it would take 1-2 hours for room service to be delivered! In contrast, when we had a problem in the room, guest services sent someone up to take care of it within 15 minutes.The hotel itself is located at the end of Waikiki Beach, but is a very walkable distance to the shops/activities downtown. For families, not actively participating in the night life, the location is fine. You can do a nice stroll in the evening along the beach without the loud music of the hotel bars closer to the center of town. For singles/couples, probably a bit removed from evening activities. In any case, we found it helpful to rent a car to go out to the North Shore, Hanama Bay, Bishop Museum, Pearl Harbor, etc. which was our focus rather than shopping downtown.FACILITIES - BIGGEST BEACH FRONT ON WAIKIKI, DISAPPOINTING SUPER POOLThe biggest benefit of the property is the size of the beachfront compared to other hotels on Waikiki. We had a nice plot of sand every day (even when we didn't come early) to build sand castles, throw the football, and lounge around. This was our priority when we searched for a hotel and we weren't disappointed. It has to be said that you have to pay for beach chairs, but it seems to be standard along Waikiki Beach. The biggest disappointment of the hotel, however, was the Super Pool. While large relative to some of the other pools we saw at other hotels in the area, it is about as big as a large backyard pool in the midwest of the US. Given the size of the property, no surprise that people reserve lounge chairs early in the morning which meant that if you didn't, you wouldn't have one for the whole day! During our week stay at the hotel we weren't able to secure 2 lounge chairs together on any of the days there.RESTAURANTS - PLEASANTLY SURRPISEDThe hotel has a large variety of restaurants, from the casual (Round Table Pizza, a deli, etc.) to upscale. Unsurprisingly, the ones located within the hotel itself (as opposed to among the shops) are pricey. However, for the money, the food in these restaurants was exceptional. My wife and I ate at the Chinese restaurant. Given we've lived in Asia for the last 10 years, we feared that it would turn out to be 'American Chinese food. We were happily surprised that it was some of the best Chinese Food we'd had in the US in a long time. During the day, Round Table Pizza was a staple for the kids and given the volume of orders they have, the turn it around quite quickly. For breakfast, would pass on the over priced buffett and leave the hotel. There's a diner right down the road (can't remember the name, but it's 1 block from the property entrance) which served a great breakfast and meant the kids didn't have to get up too early if they weren't so inclined.There is a small restaurant by the Super Pool which surprisingly has a very limited menu. Wait staff is very nice and attentive, but not much variety in the menu meant we didn't go there beyond the first time.SERVICE - PLEASANTLY SURPRISEDAgain, our expectations were low given the size of the hotel in particular. However, I must say that after a week, I was surprised at the consistent level of service received and the pleasant nature of the all staff encountered. When we arrived, despite a very full lobby, our luggage was tagged quickly and delivered to our room within 5 minutes of us arriving in the room. The event desk staff was very helpful with suggestions and bookings (and changes when oour luau was rained out). Given the size of the property, I think it unreasonable to expect personalized service of the kind seen at a Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton. Put in that perspective, our experience with the service staff at a minimum did not detract from the positive experience overall at HHV and, in several ways, enhanced our stay.Do keep in mind that you'll be nickeled and dimed to death at pool/beachl. You'll pay for beach chairs, lounge chairs, for towels if you don't return them at the pool, etc. CONCLUSIONThe HHV is a good family property with, I think among the biggest beachfront along Waikiki Beach. Rooms are OK, but nothing exceptional relative to other properties in the same price range. HHV is not a hotel where the service will overwhelm, so it is best to keep expectations in check in that regard (in lght of some of the reviews I've read). More than anything, it's a great jumping off point for the many attractions on Oahu with a staff who facilitates much of your stay.

<Content>Terrific Hotel My husband and I stayed for 14 nights and it was absolutely wonderful - we were in the Tapa Tower on the 34th floor Ocean View - it was absolutely spectacular. The room was great - not overly large but really comfortable. The bed was the most comfortable we have ever slept in. Down pillows and duvet. The views were unbelievable. We also had a coffee maker in our room and got one packet free everyday - the only time you paid for it was if you used more than one packet per day....pretty good price for the internet service as well....Tapa pool was great - beach was beautiful....food was incredibly expensive - but if you go off site you can definitely save. The bus service was great - incredibly organized. Went on a great Island Tour which wasn't too long. The only negative thing I have to say about the whole thing is the housekeeping service was not too great. I had to call a couple of times to have them re do the room, but, overall it was #1. We'd go back in a heartbeat.....recommend it to anyone....

<Content>wonderful resort very clean but overpriced!!!!! Wonderful resort . We came for 15 nights with our 2 children who are 13 and 10.They upgraded us to an ocean suite in the tapa tower, which was just wonderful. Lovely and clean and wonderful veiws of the ocean and Honolulu.The suite was very spacious and clean and we also had veiws of the whole of the Hilton Resort.I do believe that for the prices they charge, they should not charge for using the coffee, chocolate etc. drinks in your suite and they should also supply Tea and a Tea pot!Free breakfast would have been an added benefit, as many Hotels do supply this.We did have a wonderful stay though and i would defently return again, just so much to do on the resort,that you do not even have to go of site if you didn't want too, even if it is over priced (but then that is Honolulu for you and the Hilton do take advatage of this! The shops and resturants on site are very expensive and seem to cater alot for the Japeneese, but then they do go there in their thousands!Catering for a wider range would be a better option along with cheaper prices and ohhhhh it defently needs an on site Laundarette!!!

<Content>Overpriced / Overrated / Over Aged Service is spotty at best with cheerful attitudes a rarity. Got an upgrade to a suite (Hilton Diamond Member) where sinks don't drain, shower doesn't drain, faucets turn the wrong way, AC barely cools, coffee is $3.75 per packet.Dining is WAY too expensive. Breakfast quality is average.Super pool is a joke and closes at 5 PM.

<Content>A Beautiful Stay in the Kalia Tower We recently stayed at this hotel over Easter, and it was definitely an above average hotel. The entire complex is really it's own village. There are miles and miles of shops (extremely expensive) and lots of ABC stores (small convenience stores). I do think that dividing the hotel into 5 different towers was a good idea, otherwise the size of the place would be overwhelming. We stayed at the Kalia Tower, at the executive floors (top 22-25) in an ocean-view suite. The view was fantastic, and the room was nice, but average. Luckily, the executive floors recieved a free breakfast, snack and horderves, otherwise we would have been stuck paying the ridiculous prices ($13 for a regular hamburger, $21 for the good breakfast buffet) in the village. Something that sort of bothered us was that they charged for EVERYTHING, even the coffee for the coffee-maker in your room! Considering you pay over $400 per night for an oceanview suite, you would think they could at least throw in some coffee. Even cheap-o motels throw in coffee for free. All in all, for the money, you get a gorgeous hotel, with multitudes of pools and beach, and wonderful gardens, but you could probably do better to stay at a cheaper hotel near by and just walk through the gardens once in a while. However, if you love spectacular scenery and wish to stay in a place with tons of it, the Hilton Hawaiian Village is the place for you.*Also, a small footnote to add would be that we went on a FANTASTIC tour while we stayed on the island -- it wasn't too long and it took you to places you just don't see in Waikiki, gorgeous scenic photo opportunities too! We'd definitely reccomend it: E Moa Tours, and the Grand Small Island tour*

<Content>Ali'i Tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village the best! I stayed here a week for a conference and it was one of the most pleasant stays I've had in HNL. The Ali'i Tower is first class! I had large king room with ocean/city views that was extremely spacious. I had a small separate living space, desk, and a large flat screen TV. They had an afternoon ice service, turn down service, and this tower has it's own private pool!!! The pool was never crowded, quiet and peaceful. They also have a complimentary breakfast (continental) every morning. The HHV is a village: lots of shopping, excellent dining, lively bar (Tapa Bar). It is, from my understanding, the largest hotel on HNL, so expect a crowd when you venture outside of your tower. But the grounds are absolutely beautiful, the service wonderful, and the views breathtaking. I highly recommend it for families and business travelers alike.P.S. Added plus for business travelers is their 24 hour full service business center (shipping, printing, internet, copying), WIFI spots, and wireless internet in your room with the ability to print to a nearby terminal from your room (front desk or business center).

<Content>Great Place For Family Vacation This was our first trip to Hawaii and we picked Honolulu, primarily to do as much of the typical tourist activities as possible. Planning for this trip, I researched this site and obtained a lot of great information to make the most out of our vacation. Now I'd like to give back and share our overall experience with future vacationers.We stayed at the HHV in the Ali'i tower for 7 nights, from 4/13 to 4/19. We picked this tower because the rooms are suppose to be bigger, nicer, and with a separate vanity area outside the bathroom (which I figure was needed for a family of four). The separate vanity was nice, but nothing like a 5 star hotel in Vegas. I would consider the room comfortable and the partial ocean view was more or less what I expected. We live in San Diego so an ocean view was not a big requirement for us. The hotel grounds as stated by many are spacious, well groomed, and always full of activities. We liked it, buit It was a bit loud at night when you're going to sleep with live music blasting. The HHV beach is by far the biggest and nicest after walking all of Waikiki beach. We only used it once due to the sewage spillage problem and opted for the pool when the kids wanted to go swimming. The sand is grainy and coarse not like sand you find in California or Florida. During our walk we saw the Halekulani hotel which was one park and 3 hotels to the east of the HHV. We had considered the Halekulani (based on reviews) but they only allowed 3 per room and we weren't going to pay for two rooms at those prices as they suggested. The beach in front of the Halekulani was a complete joke consisting of an area no more than 30' x 30' and a walkway for public access. You would need to use the beaches of the adjacent hotels to find any room. Also loud construction was occuring in front of this hotel. In contrast, the hotel is very clean, elegant, with a well manicured central courtyard. We also liked the Outrigger reef hotel and the Ala Moana hotel further down. At the HHV, my wife and I signed up for the massage at the Mandara Spa. It was great and very relaxing. They also have small shows at the base floors at three of the towers every night.FOODAs far as food goes, there are a million places to eat from affordable to very expensive. At the HHV grounds, we ate at the Golden Dragon (expensive, small portions, but very good), Benihanas (only went cause the kids like to see the chef do his stuff), Round Table Pizza (good pizza large for $25), and ABC store for snacks and drinks. We didn't do the buffet at the Rainbow tower, nor the continental breakfast based on the comments by others about pricing. The Ali'i tower does offer free hor doeurves at 5pm by the private pool. We snacked here twice. We also ate the Tropics bar on the ground floor of the Ali'l tower upon arrival for lunch. Fed kids hot dog, hamburgers, fries and drinks. Food was average but the bill was $50 ! Across the street, the Wailana Coffee House offers great value for breakfast/lunch/dinner as so many have noted. We ate here 3 times. We also went to Leonards Bakery for Masaladas, a Portugese pastry that should be eaten hot. Actually, my son and I walked there from the HHV after finding the street on the tourist map. BIg mistake. It turned out to be about a 3 mile walk, but after eating the Masaladas we decided it was worth the hike. We also ate a breakfast buffet one morning at the Outgrigger Reef hotel 5 minutes walk to the east. It was average and the price is $12/person.MAIN SHOPPING AREAHHV sits on the western edge of Waikiki and requires a short 15 min walk to the main shopping areas of Waikiki. This is well worth the visit for an afternoon or evening to see all of the other hotels and to browse the hundreds of shops. Recommendation: YES.GRAND ISLAND TOURWe signed up for this all day tour on the second day of our vacation. It turned out to be a great move to get an overview of the island. I highly recommend this tour. The tour also scheduled stops at many places for 10-20 minutes at a time for visting/siteseeing. Some stops included Hanauma Bay, Byodo temple, north shore beaches, Dole plantation, and our favorite the Waimea Falls. Our tour guide (Frank) was a riot and we enjoyed his crude jokes and comments, although some passengers didn't. Recommendation: BIG YES.DIAMOND HEADNIce hike to the top with great views of Waikiki hotels. We drove here in our rental car instead of going with a tour. Good way to spend a morning. Shaved ice stand at bottom was a nice ($4 each) way to finish this visit. Recommnedation: YES.PEARL HARBOR TOUR MISSOURI/ARIZONAThis is a half day tour to visit the memorial and to tour the retired battleship Missouri. The tour includes a movie and for me was emotional and rather depressing. The last part of the tour was to drive through punchbowl cemetery, not a big deal. Recommendation: NEUTRAL / ONCE IS ENOUGH.POLYNESIAN CULTURE CENTERDrove here instead of opting for a tour to give us flexibility to explore the island in the morning. The PCC opens at 12pm. We stopped at the Dole plantation again to do the maze and to visit their garden and shops. We didn't have time with the Grand Island Tour. To the near west of the PCC are several food stands that serve fresh shrimp with rice. Stopped for a snack at Giovannis shrimp stand as recommended by others. It was nice. At the PCC we did the self guided tour again for flexibility to see the shows at our own pace. Our ticket included the Ali'i luau. Food was good, not great. The big show at the end of the night was also entertaining. We left early cause the wife and kids were burnt out. The drive back was easy. I found the road well lit with many cars going back to Honolulu, contrary to comments by other saying the road was dark. In summary, the PCC is worth an initial visit, but we would not come back a second time. RECOMMENDATION: YES.ATLANTIS SUBMARINEOut of impulse, we booked the Atlantis sub ride. You are picked up at the pier in front of the HHV and driven out to the sub. The sub ride lasts about 45 minutes. We were very disappointed with the tour as we hardly saw any sealife. The sub goes on a preplanned route to visit man made sea habitats and a couple of sunken ships. For nearly $400 dollars for the four of us, I expected a lot more. RECOMMENDATION: NO.HANAUMA BAYTook my son snorkeling here one morning, while the wife took my daughter shopping. This place is great. We drove here rather than take a tour or bus. It's about 15 minutes from the HHV. I was worried about finding a parking space since the lot is closed after it becomes full. From the previous Grand Island Tour, I found the lot has plenty of spaces and I estimate you can find a spot if you arrive before 8:30am. No need to get here at 6:30am as some have suggested. You can rent all the snorkeling equipment at the beach for less than $10/person. You wil see lots and lots of fish. RECOMMENDATION: BIG YES.In summary, we were very happy with our stay at the HHV hotel. I thnk it's a great choice for a family with kids.

<Content>Great hotel Hotel is great! We stayed here only two nights during April 2006. The hotel grounds are extensive for the Waikiki area. We stayed in the Ali tower and it was a beautiful and luxurious room. We had a great view of the ocean and Diamond head. We would have stayed longer, but the recent sewage problem in Waikiki made us change our plans to go to another island. I would definitely come back here again when the waters clear!

<Content>Ho-hum My wife and I stayed at the HHV on Jan. 4-8, the first part of an 8-day trip that included staying at the Grand Wailea Resort on Maui.On the positive side, the HHV is unquestionably on the best part of Waikiki Beach. It's section of beach is both long and wide, and furthermore is adjacent to Fort DeRussy park, a scenic garden and park that is part of a military monument. As such, the HHV is separated from the crowded eastern end of Waikiki Beach.The HHV is an attractive property, with extensive and lushly landscaped grounds complete with scenic walkways, penguins(!) and flamingos.Additionally, the HHV has upscale shopping including men's and women's fashions and jewelry. The HHV is within walking distance (albeit a long walk) of the Ala Moana Center, the only true shopping mall in all the islands. Ala Moana is mid- to upscale, with a Macy's and Neiman-Marcus. (FYI, a taxi ride to/from Ala Moana is about $7 including tip.)The HHV has some nice restaurants -- we ate at Bali by the Sea and paid $95 for dinner. The HHV breakfast buffet is about $55 for two people but worth it once or twice.(For moderately-priced meals, there are several other eating choices in the Village --not run by Hilton -- that are mom-and-pop style restaurants such as: a sushi bar, a Thai noodles place, and a New York-style deli. The closest most cost-effective meal is the Waimea Cafe, a diner located literally across the street from the HHV. A yummy breakfast for two -- comparable to, say, Denny's -- is about $18, with lunch and dinner similarly less expensive. There are food courts located at Ala Moana Center and at the International Marketplace located in downtown Waikiki -- about a 15 minute walk. There is also an ABC convenience store on the HHV property, enabling guests to purchase soda, snacks, and alcohol for their rooms at much more reasonable prices.)Finally on the positive side, the service was polite and efficient, ranging from the front-desk people, to the restaurant service, to the maid service.Now for the negatives: the HHV is an *old* resort. The Rainbow Tower (where we stayed) was built in 1968 and you can tell. There are, for example, air conditioning problems. The south and east facing 01 corner rooms (#701, #1501, etc) have two external walls that are essentially glass doors that open to scenic balconies. We were booked in #701 but had to be moved to #1800 (the 00 rooms are also corner rooms, but facing facing south and west) because since the air conditioning is evidently so antiquated, all the 01 rooms have difficulty cooling as the eastern sun beats in throughout the day. (The HHV maintenance worker who inspected #701's air conditioning before we moved told me this.) So, despite the breathtaking views, the 01 rooms never really get cool inside.The decor and furnishings are all boring and probably a quarter-century old -- at least they looked it. Then there's the matter of timeshare sales. At the HHV you'll definitely be hit-up to go to a sales presentation. It's all rather bad form. (FYI, the Kalia and Lagoon Towers, I believe, are evidently entirely time-shares, meaning a sizable percentage of the resort is actually condos, and not hotel rooms.)Finally, and I suppose this isn't the HHV's fault, is Honolulu itself. The city is a seedy pig-sty with a definitive Third World feel to it. Go a few blocks outside the resort area of Waikiki and you can see what are effectively shanty-towns. I've lived (and currently live) in cities of over a million people (and Honolulu isn't actually a large city, by comparison) but I haven't seen such a yucky city elsewhere in America.So I suppose if you want a true resort in Hawaii, go to the Wailea coast in Maui or Kailua-Kona on the Big Island. You'll pay for it but you'll also get a resort feel -- which you certainly won't get on Waikiki. All-in-all: a ho-hum experience. Nothing bad or awful at the HHV, just not worth writing home and saying you're in paradise.

<Content>Realy enjoyed it! I've just got back from Hawaii where I travelled for a 10 day holiday with my sister. We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village as we had read the reviews on TripAdvisor and would like to say that we really enjoyed our stay. The location for the hotel was absolutely perfect - a stones throw away from Waikiki beach, which at times, can be a little busy. We stayed in the Tapa Tower - we were pleased with our room which had a bar, two double beds and a balcony with a mountain and ocean view. The only thing which I can say about it is be careful of phonecalls which you may make using the hotel's phone. According to the book it said that numbers beginning with 8 were toll free, but we got charged a dollar for each call. Something to be wary of if you're calling around for trips and quotes. But the hotel does have an American Express desk which does tours to other islands etc. We did a few tours with them which were great. One great one was the 'Pearl Harbor and Circle Island Tour.' Apart from the phone issues, the place was great, staff and guests very friendly - an excellent and thoroughly enjoyable trip to Hawaii!!

<Content>Returning again and looking forward to it My wife are going to be there on Saturday April the 8th 2006 so look out :) We used to live in Kailua (dream town) and go back a couple times a year since we moved to SF for work. Hilton Hawaiian Village is classic. I have over 30 years experience there and it is special to me. When my dad was a pilot during the Vietnam war mom and I met up with him in Hawaii (at HHV) when he had leave. He did a few tours so we went 3 times. I can still remember standing there as a 7 year old boy our first day looking at the Rainbow Tower thinking it was magical. Hawaii is magical and so are the people. For that reason I prefer the Rainbow Tower it has a special memory for me. I have seen HHV grow over the years and it gets better. We were there in Sept of 05 last and it was an incredible visit. We do 1 week there and 1.5 weeks at Turtle Bay cottages (incredible but expensive). HHV has everything you need but I beg you go see the rest of the Island have plate lunch at LL (heard they closed? can't be)lay on the beach at Kailua. Drive the coast. I miss living there sooo much. Hint: While I stay at HHV I ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS see several instances where guests are mistreating staff. This is Hawaii people stuff is not done instantly there. It is laid back. In watching outburst I have yet to see one where I am thinking yeah that guy or gal deserves to get ripped a new one. It is always some high strung person demanding something out of the ordinary and freaking out when it is not done right then and there. So here is my hintWhen you make the turn into the driveway, realize you are on vacation at a very magical spot. Expect and demand good service but realize it is slower more relaxed there. I know for a fact the HHV staff do care greatly about giving you a good time but you have to be kind to them. If you stand there screaming or upset over minor matters you are just one of 400 high strung people that week that have lost it. Try this... Screaming at people in Hawaii is a quick way to get nothing accomplished. Trust me.. Smile gently explain your issue, dilemna, problem, keep smiling, be nice and watch what happens. They will bend over backwards to fix it. They will often even give you extra service or something. When it comes to pleasing guests HHV has not peer. You just have to think laid back lifestyle. You gotta realize they have tons of guests there year round and the operation they have going is stellar and tight. I love HHV and look forward to seeing YOU there Saturday April the 8th 2006. I'll be the big goofy guy with a beautiful sweet wife. Enjoy HHV I highly recommend it. We just love it there. Of all the properties downtown HHV is simply the best most exciting place. The staff is in my opinion incredible in all the years not 1 bad experience.

<Content>Kids loved hhv We stayed in the ali tower which was very well done. The beds were very comfy. My favorite was the bathroom setup it was divided into three large areas bathroom , shower and sink, huge dressing area with walk in closet more sinks all separated by doors. It made it very helpful since we were traveling with two boys.Room well done and recently updated. We had a pov which was great because it also overlooked the superpool where the show and fireworks were on fri. night, just watch from balcony . Food at the chinese restaraunt on site was fabulous worth the money, pricy. We also did the rainbow tower buffet breakfast great if free or coupon but not worth full price. The snack bar at ali tower great quick food. You must walk down beach for $2.00 giant shaved ice they were the best.We enjoyed pearl harbor and then walked to famous swap meet a few blocks away cheap to get in and worth it, tons of great deals torists and locals use this swap meeet . I think its only on Sat.,Sun. and weds. at stadium. We took cabs both ways at $35..00 a trip definately could do this cheaper with shuttles but alot more wait time with shuttles. Pearl harbor go early it does sell out.Last Dukes Canoe Club Way overrated our least favorite meal on oahu long waits and poor service and hotel was flooded due to rains and stunk.Loved walking along shops at Wakiki. Oahu is a must do but I wouldn't spend more than a few days then hit Maui or another island. Yes, we were rained out on part of our stay but made the best of it. Lots to do. I hope this helps I read this site alot before my trip and got lots of tips. Such a friendly island.

<Content>Beautiful location. . .but service sure isn't what it should be. . . I stayed 3 nights in the Ali'i Tower, which is nice, but probably not worth a return trip. It's close to the beach, has its own pool (quite small, but a very nice sundeck) and a nice continental breakfast each morning from 6:30-10. They charge $14, although I received it free with my AMEX platinum card. I am not sure I would have paid $14/day otherwise. The two ladies who work there in the morning are lovely. The rooms are nice, have flat screen tvs, a comfortable bed and couch, and nice lanais. It does include coffee and water, which apparently some of the other towers don't. They are supposed to come with turn-down service each night where they restock, but I needed to specifically ask for it 2 of the 3 nights. Eventually they did come, so all's well that ends well.I laughed at how hard the property tries to keep you on site. Between all the restaurants, shops, and the nice strip of beach, you really would never have to leave.The retailers are top of the line (Louis Vuitton, Maui Divers, etc). The people who work there are lovely and professional (esp Cindy in Maui Divers and both Laura and Laurie in Louis).However, I will say that everyone associated with the hotel is a little strained. No smiles or friendly greetings, a reluctant doorman, awkward bell service where you can't call ahead for your car but need to bring them the ticket and then just stand there and wait for it... it all detracts from the absolutely beautiful property with their pink flamingos and cute little penguins. One of the managers told me that hotel was recently downgraded to 3 stars because of poor service. I found that very telling. They should definitely take some lessons from the retailers.So, all in all, I got a great rate and perfect location for what I needed, but for vacation or personal trips, I will likely not be a return visitor.

<Content>excellent Loved our stay at hilton hawaiian village. my husband and two teenage daughters stayed here - found a great deal on expedia - we got room in ali tower. it was spacious and very clean, the beds were awesomely comfortable. the bathroom was spacious which was great for 3 women trying to get ready! two sinks and a seperate toilet area - the plasma tv, the beautiful view of the garden was peaceful and quiet, the maid service 3 x's daily, the turndown service with chocolates, free newspaper daily, coffee/tea service and comp. water, all nice touches. Loved the complimentary appetizers each nite at the poolside cabana on 2nd floor. all were yummy and we didnt' even need dinner those nights as we were full from appetizers. So we would go out for a great dessert each night somewhere. Having the private pool on 2nd floor for ali tower was great too - and the hot tub! Beautiful views of the grounds and the beach from pool side. The only downside was the price of drinks...$ 8.75 for a cocktail. very pricey. ;o( and the continental breakfast offered in ali tower poolside - very expensive for skimpy offerings. $ 14 a person for basic rolls/toast, some fruit, and cereal. You can get a large buffet for about $20+ Paying $14 for continental breakfast. Crazyespecially when we did go down the last morning as we were rushed to catch our flight, and the girls wanted something quick for breakfast, so we went there and at about 15 min. to 10am, the staff started taking the breakfast items away already! My daughter was getting a piece of bread out to toast, and the waitstaff gal came and grabbed the toaster off the table while looking at my daughter! If it says they serve til 10am, they should leave the items out til 10am. The staff there seemed rushed and wanting to get it all cleaned up by 10am. Other than that we LOVED stay there, and the rest of the staff was very friendly and helpful.

<Content>HHV got it right, great trip for hard to please Gold Member The HHV got it right. It was my spring break family vacation and not the many trips for business that I stay at Hiltons that have made me a gold member. We paid for an ocean front room in Rainbow tower and did not use points because it was our vacation and the room with a view was a must and did not want to leave it to chance, but was concerned about the size of the room with two teenage boys in tow. I fretted more about this trip after reading some of the reviews. I was hoping that this trip might be a 7 at best and instead I got a 10 trip and it was all due to the HHV taking care of us and realizing what our needs where. On arrival we where upgraded to a one bedroom suite in the Tapa tower instead of the ocean front double. Wonderful!!! Two bathrooms, a master bedroom with a door and two Tv's, 2 balconies and a great view. We loved the room. They also added breakfast coupons for the family for the various places to eat with a very reasonable upgrade fee. The resort is very nice and the food was expensive but good.I would hope other Hiltons would take notice of when thier regulars travel and come to vacation that they upgrade and pamper like HHV did.Before this trip I was thinking about switching to another hotel chain, because many of the other Hiltons are just not doing enough for their Hilton members, a bottle of water and upgrade to the spa, just does not cut it.So great work HHV. We enjoyed the resort and all that the area has to offer. We will be back and I will look forward to it.

<Content>Classic hotel I know the hotel very well. As a child my father was a bartender there in the 70-80s so I hung out there a lot. Staying there was a great experience. There was a reviewer who complained that everything had a price. I have travelled much and all hotels now even in Vegas require extra, so I don't understand what world he/she is living in. There is no free bottle water or coffee in any hotels any more unless you have included continental breakfast in the lobby.Cable is mostly basic. Even HBO is a luxury now. And lanudry is always expensive. Most people bring enough for the trip. Just pack febreeze in your bag!Once in Vegas, in a hotel not to be named, I took back some great leftover pizza to my room. The frig was so tiny, I had to take out the bottles of soda and water in the frig to cram the leftover in. I left the bottles and cans in plain sight, unopened, undamaged. I was charged for all the bottles and cans, my leftover removed from the frig to be placed unrefrigerated on the counter and the same bottles replaced. Of course I didn't know this until I got the bill a month later after doing express check out. I ultimately got credit back.The Hilton is very close to the heart of Waikiki, and it's active, populated like any hotel in Vegas. If you are looking for a getaway, research better because any hotel in Waikiki is not the isolated resort some people are looking for. It's fun and busy. It has night clubs, bars, it's own beach, restaurants and shops. If you want isolation the go to the outer islands or look into the Mandarin Hotel or Ka Olina in Kapolei, Oahu.The HHV is a classic hotel, it may be dated in some areas but many hotels that have been around are like that. Even presidents have stayed there. You can't go wrong.

<Content>A Great Property This is a small city in of itself. It's an excellent property with literally everything you need close by. The views of the water and beach plus the shopping, food options and entertainment, you really can't go wrong. It's expensive but isn't everything in Hawaii? Wireless access charges were excessive ($12.95 a day) so I found a third party access point for $29.95 a week. I had to access it on the balcony but that's a great place to hang out.

<Content>Loved the Hilton! We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in the Tapas Tower in June 2005. The hotel was beautiful. The room was beautiful, clean, comfortable and king size bed fabulous. We purchased the breakfast buffet as a part of hotel cost and it was outstanding. We ate pancakes with coconut and coconut syrup every day! The hotel has everything you need. Drugstores, restaurants, bars, shopping are all over the place. The hotel is not right on the main strip but we took the trolley everywhere. The beach was great and so were the pools. We also loved the warm weather penguins. I recommend this hotel to everyone. If you can afford it the Ali Tower looked like heaven. We were very happy and would stay there again.

<Content>Loved this Hotel!! We just came back from here and we really enjoyed our stay. I agree with some of the other reviews on the super pool and the price of beach chairs/umbrella's. But have you checked out the other hotels? We did, their beach area is pretty well non existant, their pool is much smaller and their food prices are just the same. That is to be expected in Hawaii. We found the Hilton Hawaiian to be the best for your dollar, the beach area is spectacular,as well as the grounds. If the food is too pricey, do what we did, buy alot of fruit/bread/snacks etc. at the ABC stores and keep in your fridge. That really cut down on the price of food. As for daily parking, try parking in San Francisco, we paid $36 per day. We asked for an upgrade and received one (not always possible) but if they can they will(Thanks again Rissa, your the best) Don't forget, relax and enjoy this is your vacation everything at this hotel compared to the others we saw is by far way more superior. Loved It!!!

<Content>Just enormous! This place was huge, acres of resort! We stayed in the Kalia Tower which is the newest on the 9th floor. The room was nice, very clean and neat - nothing spectacular but modern.It had views of the ocean and the rainbow tower and has it's own pool on the same floor at the health spa which was handy.Staff were friendly, but give Beni-hana a miss if you have been to others, no tricks really even though food was fine.On Friday night's they have a polynesian show by the pool and fireworks. We recommend going to the Golden Dragon restaurant on this night as we did and it is the most beautiful food and you can watch the fireworks from the balcony.Lots of designer shops, but also a few pratical ones such as ABC Convenience store. The Rainbow Lanai buffet was good, but we went to the Tapa tower buffet most days as it wasn't as busy. Has a nice outlook over a pool and the new wedding chapel.There is penguins, flamingos, turtles etc. in ponds around the resort so look our for those.Great place for couples, families etc. We enjoyed the large pool, but getting a deck chair is difficult. The beach is nice and calm, good for families.We self-parked, which seemed easier from our tower than valet parking. Although the Kalia tower has it's own desk (which is handy when checking out), there is sometimes a delay in valet parking from here.They apparently charge you for the in-room safe per day, but it never came up on our bill.As honeymooners we got a nice bottle of champagne. Our package included breakfast which was good.It is about a 15-20 minute walk out of the main street, which was a blessing due to the construction of the Beach Walk.You have to go to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre, it is enormous - we loved Bubba Gump's (based on the movie Forrest Gump), the shrimp is fantastic. We would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>The best place in Honolulu This was our 2nd visit to this island and hotel, so we knew what to expect. Last time we stayed at the Diamond Head tower and had no complaints about the room. This time we wanted to be closer to the beach, so we requested the Rainbow tower. Thanks to my husband's Diamond VIP status with HHonors, we usually get upgraded to a better room. Our room in the Rainbow Tower was a double room with 2 bathrooms, 2 balconies, king size and a sofa bed. No ocean view, but the view is never our priority as we try not to spend much time in the room on any vacation. There are 6 toweres: Rainbow and Ali are the oldest and closest to the beach and the Super pool, Tapa and Kalia are the newest, but the farthest from the beach. Kalia has it's own pool and the hotel's ONLY tiny hot tub. There's nothing super about the SuperPool, but again, not a priority for us. However, if you prefer to spend time by the pool consider requesting a tower with it's own pool. Also, be prepaired to wake up early to reserve a chair by the Superpool, as there's not enough of them. The hotel grounds are nice enough, but pale in comparisson to the Hilton on the Big Island or the Hyatt in Maui, where you truly see Hawaii in it's splendor. The hotel's beach is one of the best on Oahu. Again, don't expect the sweeping beaches of the Carribean, but it's pretty nice for Honolulu. At $51/day the price for beach lounges and an umbrella is unreasonable (in my opinion), so we took a short drive to Wal-Mart and bought those for $10 each. They also sell an umbrella holder, you screw it it the sand and you umbrella stays put in any wind. It worked so well, we brouhgt it home with us and will use it at the beach here. Another advise: look through the travel booklets, i.e.Oahu Today, etc. There's lot's of coupons for restaurants(2 for 1 at the Thai place across the streetfrom the Hilton and many others), Luau (20% off the Germaines) and lot's of activities. Haunuma Bay snorkeling is great, but be there early in the morning or after 2 pm to avoid crowds. We rented our equipment from Snorkle Bob, so you can use it for several days.Food: the only meal we ate at the hotel (Rainbow Lanai) regularly was breakfast. This is only because my husband got a huge discount: we paid $3.50 for a continental buffet(no hot items). We found the selection, service and food quality at the buffet to be excellent, but I would never pay it's full price of $19.95. The food on the hotel property is extremely overpriced, so plan accordingly. I would also recommend to rent a car for at least several days. The island has many beautiful spots and we enjoyed some spectacular drives. The Japanese temple deserves a visit.The hotel has fireworks every Friday and a Luau. It's nice to walk around in the evening with all the nice lights and beautiful music playing. They really try but the Hilton is just too huge to create this warm and fuzzy feeling. One last thing: if your plane leaves at night, request a hospitality suite, where you can take a shower and change after a day at the beach. A very nice touch that not many hotels offer. Overall, our family had a great time, but again, it was a free trip for us and things may've looked different if we paid top dollar for this stay.

<Content>Paradise The hotel is fabulous! It is on a lovely stretch of beach with great views. The rooms are spacious, well-equiped and very clean.It has so much to do you never actually need to leave the hotel! There are a large number of bars and restaurants, and there are a large selection of other restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.Staff were always helpful and friendly.Only slight negative is there are not enough loungers at the pool areas, so you have to be there early to get one for the day.

<Content>Excellent We stayed 5 nights in the Kalia Tower in a mountain view room. The hotel has beautiful grounds and lots of facilities. The Kalia and Ali towers both have thier own swimming pools and jacuzzi whereas the other towers they are communal. The Kalia tower is the newest and the rooms were really nice, spacious, well furnished, good size bathroom and very clean. Beach is also lovely. The hotel has many eating options, however the service is variable and the prices expensive. The location is such that you are within a very short walk of cheap/good restuarants and shopping malls as well as Waikkiki itself. Our only complaint was the service, being a large hotel they don't really bother and can be quite cold and unhelpful at times.

<Content>Fine if you like this type of thing While there is no denying that the hotel setting is very impressive, we found overall this hotel was rather impersonal.The service was a little inconsistent, although the tour desk were extremely helpful when we were booking excursions.Our room was OK, although a little dated. We were not fans of Waikiki overall and the Hawaian village was really a microcosm of Waikiki, so that was probably why we did not get a favourable impression. If you would like to find yourself in what could be in places any US city near the beach this is for you. If you would like a secluded beach getaway avoid this place like the plague!

<Content>Everyone Has A Hand Out As a government traveler, I have come to expect that certain ammenities are not part of the accomodations that I expect, and pay for, while traveling on per diem. The Hilton Hawaiian Villiage takes this concept to the extreme. From the moment I checked in, I found that even the most basic ammenities that I expect with a hotel room cost extra. Everything from the short bottles of water and small packets of coffee in the room that are usually considered complementary had an exhorbitant price tag attached to them. There was only very basic cable TV available, unless you paid for more channels. Even the internet service was (very)extra. Most places where I stay include these as part of the package. There is also no self-service laundry facility at this hotel and the cost of their in-house laundry service nearly exceeds the cost of new clothes. (It was a relief to find that the oxygen that I consumed during my stay came with no extra charge.) I felt more like a source of revenue than a welcome guest. It might not seem like a big deal to some, but this constant stream of fees really takes that welcome feeling away.If you do decide to patronize the Hilton on Waikiki and are assigned to the Rainbow Tower, beware. You will be nickel-and-dimed to no end. They never let you forget that you are a government traveler.

<Content>Gorgeous Slice of Paradise We had a wonderful visit to the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We stayed in the Ali'i Tower (definitely ask for an upgrade to this tower) and enjoyed the experience. The rooms are beautiful, the beds comfortable, the lanai's beautiful views. Excellent property. The only negative was the food was so so at several of the restaurants. I thoroughly enjoyed the gorgeously landscaped grounds, the wildlife (penguins!!!), swans, koi, birds and the beautiful flowers, including orchids, growing wild. The beach is close and accessible. Negatives would be everything has an extra cost. Internet access is extra, parking is expensive, coffee in the room is extra, but if you know that you can pick and choose wisely where to spend your money. The shops are delightful and make walking around the grounds very enjoyable. All in all, a wonderful experience.CherylMinneapolis

<Content>Great hotel, needs more pool space We really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Jan. 27-Feb. 1/06.Our room in the Kalia Tower was large and comfortable. The grounds and beach were beautiful.The only area that could stand some improvement was the Super Pool. There is not enough space to accommodate half the people who would like to use it. They need another large outdoor pool. For the price of the rooms, people should have access. The pool was also shut down early for private functions on a couple of occasions, which seems like a disservice to paying guests.

<Content>great place We got back a week ago from a week long stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I read some of the reviews before we left, and cannot understand what all of the complaining was for from some of the reviews that I read. We had an absolutely great time. The hotel was completely booked (President's Week), and we estimated that with 3,000 rooms, there were approximately 10,000 guests that week, but you would never know it. You did need to go down early to get a lounger by the superpool, but that was nothing to complain about. The staff was courteous, the rooms were terrific and the view was to die for!! The hotel grounds are beautiful and there really is no reason to leave the hotel grounds. We did go on day journeys but also enjoyed the days sitting by the pool or on the beach (which just happens to be the best part of Waikiki Beach.) I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat and would recommend it without hesitation.

I have been reading a lot of critical reviews of the HHV on this web site so I went into this with some reservation and an open mind.As I am a Hilton Diamounds member I am usally well taken care of at any Hilton property so I was not concerned.First let me say that The hotel met and exceeded every expectation I had.For my first two days I was in the Tapa Tower room 3446 which gave a decent view but was too far removed from the beach, also the beds wer two small queen bed.I wasked for a room change and got the rainbow tower T1805 which was right on the beach - wild I slept with the windows open all the time - breathing in the clear ocean air an sound fo gentle waves breaing in the surf.The entire staff was 100% excelent in every manner - room service food was excpetional.I was also given kindly a hospitality room on the day of my check out to take a shower before I headed to the air port - AVOID that tower - diamond head.In life you get what you pay for - and in this case paying means securing a room in on of the better towers and also paying for all the other things you'lll need to secure a wonderful time - e.g sufring lessions, altantus sub tour, etc etc Its only money - and I feel like I got great value and great service here Best ebenefit is perfect location right qat the center of all the action TWO strong thumbs up !

<Content>Tourists abound in a convenient location, classy accomodation My husband and I stayed in the Rainbow Tower for three days while I attended a conference on the grounds of the resort. The hotel was extremely busy, but the room was very tidy, hotel staff always assisted with needs in and out of the room and the resort has a lot of amenities. The most pleasant aspect is the beach on property! We took several day-tours, and recommend concierge advice (for tours and dining) over the American Express travel desk in the lobby. He was able to provide us with better deals and suggestions for traveling in Hawai'i. Don't eat at the Japanese restaurant on Hilton's property (I'm not speaking about Benihana's, but the smaller restaurant across from the book shop). It was the worst Japanese food we have *ever* had. In contrast, the quiche at the little caf茅 in the Kali Tower must have been phenomenal; my husband ate there every morning that I was at the conference!A few highlights for your trip:- Sam Choy's restaurant is AMAZING for a fine dining experience- Visit 'Leonard's Bakery' for fresh, hot malasadas (Portugese pastries)- Seabird Tours - coupon in 'Best of Oahu' (pick up at concierge desk) for $12 round trip transport and gear to snorkel at Hanauma Bay- Polynesian Cultural Center - don't spend extra for the 'Ambassador' package unless you can't navigate yourself around a theme park; don't take a tour with Rob (Samoa)- Chinatown is a lot of fun for an afternoon walk or for a photo-shoot- Go to Hanauma Bay early, early in the morning (otherwise the water becomes cloudy from swimmers)- Take a hike with 'Oahu Nature Tours' - Mike, the owner, is extremely knowledgeable and helpfulHave a wonderful time! Aloha!

<Content>Lovely Ali'i Tower We stayed in the Ali'i Tower for 3 nights this past weekend, after a week in Kauai. We booked our room through the American Express Platinum Fine Hotels and Resorts programme. We paid $311 for a partial ocean view room and that included an upgrade, (when available)continental breakfast for 2 each morning, a lunch for 2 at the Rainbow Lanai during our stay and a 4pm checkout upon departure.We, (my husband, 13 year-old daughter, 8 month son and I) arrived at 11:15am and found that our room was not ready yet. We had lunch by the private Ali'i pool and ended up eating for free because the food took a long time to get to us. Our room was ready by 1:00pm and we were pleasantly surprised to find that we had been upgraded to a corner room on the top floor with a wraparound balcony. Very romantic if we didn't have the kids with us! There was a king bed and a cot was provided for our 13 year-old.We tipped our breakfast waitress well and never had to pay for the extra breakfasts for our daughter. We never had any problems with service in the Ali'i Tower and found it to be a nice relaxing oasis in the middle of the hectic HHV. If we could guarantee room A1505 when we return to Waikiki next time without the kids, then we MIGHT stay at the HHV again....but I think that I would still rather stay at the Halekulani. It's smaller, more centrally-located and a lot less Orlando if you catch my drift.

<Content>Too crowded but overall very nice to stay I expect peacefulness and senerity when I was booking my trip to Ohau. But Waikiki simply is too crowded if you are looking for relaxation. I was there for 5 nights a week before the Pro bowl and the frontdesk guy told me that it was a slow week but boy the lobby was swamped with people from all over the world. And it definitely was too busy for my taste.Otherwise, Hilton Village is very convenient nice place to stay. There were many restaurants and shops within the hotel. The beach is located right next to your building (we stayed at Diamond Head Tower). Also many beach activities (submarines, dinner ships, ect) is located right at the Hotel. If you requested oceanview room, you have a spectacular view of Waikiki beach. Hotel room itself is just okay. Nothing to awe about.In fact, we had a minor problem with the sink in our bathroom and the room service came and fixed it. Overall I enjoyed my stay at Hilton. Just expect a little crowdness if you are thinking about staying at Hilton. But I am sure you will enjoy your stay.

<Content>Great rooms Simply put, the Hilton Hawaiian Village is a great place to stay. Before I go on vacation, I always put in hours of research into the hotels I am going to be staying at and I carefully selected the HHV based on the criteria of location, cost, past reviews, and pictures of the hotel. The HHV exceeded my expectations and I was disappointed when I had to leave the place because I really enjoyed it.I stayed in the Rainbow Tower on the very south side of the village, which is the one that is right on the beach and from what I hear is the best one to stay at. It was Pro Bowl week so the place was pretty packed.The room was beautiful, it had a nice flat screen television but the remote control and keyboard didn't seem to work properly 100% of the time and I'd wind up having to press the buttons several times before they would compute. The beds were very comfortable and I had a great sleep each night on them. The bathrooms were clean and decent sized, so no complaints there.The HHV contains four swimming pools, but I didn't utilize any of them so I can't comment too much on them other than what I saw of them. They all looked very nice and seemed to be pretty popular with the guests, I even saw John Elway (NFL Hall of Fame QB) lounging by the pool so it must be good. The staff was very friendly at the place which is always a plus, and the check-in process went by rather quickly despite the large volume of people. I have read past reviews that say that it took a very long time, but I didn't experience that.The real only negatives with this place is that everything is very expensive, though you do have to keep in mind that if you want to travel to exquisite places you have to pay exquisite prices. The dining also left a lot to be desired, especially when some of the restaurants on site seemed to be closed at certain times for no apparent reason. Also, you better like walking if you are going to stay here because the HHV is a huge property and requires plenty of walking to get around the perimeter.If I were to return to Oahu I would definitely stay here again, I loved the place.

<Content>Nickel and Dime Central! My husband and I just returned from a week in Oahu. The first few nights we stayed at the Marriott located just next door to the Hilton and the remaining four nights we stayed at the HHV. In years past, we have stayed at the HHV, The Four Seasons on Maui as well as the Grand Wailea. I have never had such HORRIBLE service or felt so nickel and dimed to death as I felt on this trip to the HHV. Believe me, I was not alone! I was shocked to see the sign in our room next to the coffee stating that for an extra package of coffee the charge would be $3.25, a tea bag was $1.95 and the list went on! For a room that cost well over $400 a night, the coffee should have been plentiful. I've stayed in far more expensive hotels and much less expensive hotels as well to find that we can have as much coffee, or tea as we like. It was insulting! My husband who was on a semi-business trip to the pro-bowl with some clients wanted to get some work done early one morning by the pool. So, at 7:45 I went to get a couple of towels and was told I had to go to the front reception area of the hotel and get ask the hotel Assistant Manager on Duty for a towel. Again, unbelievable. After returning to the pool, we were asked to leave - the pool didn't open until 8:30 and although we weren't IN the pool, we couldn't read the paper and and work on a laptop in one of the chaise lounges next to it. It was against hotel policy. Again, for $400 a night, I found this totally unacceptable. So, at 8:30, we stood IN LINE for 15 minutes to get a chair by the pool. Bottom line is that the hotel doesn't have enough space for the guests it has even though they have four pools. If you want to use one of the hotels beach chairs on the beach, be willing to pay $13 a day for it. Again, silly for a hotel guest. A free service to other upscale resorts we've stayed in. Once as I was getting up to use the restroom, a pool boy walked up with a sign that said if I left my chair unoccupied, they would take my towel and belongings to the pool hut. I told the man I was only going to the restroom and would be back in 5 minutes. His response, Sorry, it's hotel policy. If you aren't in your chair, I have to leave a sign. I couldn't believe it. What a joke!!! One morning we had breakfast in the Rainbow Lanai. The buffet was good and the view was wonderful. After we had paid our bill, I went back up to the hostess and told her we had just eaten in the restaurant and wondered if I could get a cup of coffee to go, she came back (acting totally put out) and brought me a cup of coffee, slammed down the creamer and handed me a bill for $3.65. Like an idiot, I paid it. I should have walked across the street to Starbucks and paid the same price for a decent cup of coffee. It's true the grounds are absolutely stunning - you can walk them all you want for free. My suggestion is to save your nickels and dimes and stay next door where the beds are equally if not more comfortable. I'm not a cheap person and I'm MORE than willing to pay for good service, good food and high quality. I just don't feel like I got my money's worth at HHV. I left there feeling like took every red cent they could from everyone who was willing to give it to them. We talked to reporters and producers from ESPN who felt the exact way we did. We talked to other people from the software industry who said they would never go back. We ALL agreed that the property is nice but you can't even go work out or use your laptop without having to jump through major hoops to do so. It's so not worth it. Feel free to contact me if you want further information. I'd be more than happy to share.

<Content>Beautiful, beautiful hotel grounds at Hilton Hawaiian Village My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village from Jan. 29 to Feb. 3. This was a business/pleasure trip and our first time to Oahu, fourth time to the Islands. Our reservation was for a partial oceanview with king bed; however, we automatically were upgraded to full oceanview with two doublebeds when a king wasn't available. Terrific! I found the staff extremely pleasant and helpful, and the room was clean and comfortable. Great view of, well, everything since we were on the 26th floor. The hotel grounds were what really pleased me, though. Gorgeous landscaping that is meticuously maintained everyday. Exotic birds around every corner with many wild birds encouraged to visit by feeding stations set on rooftops. Lovely waterfalls, koi ponds, winding pathways, Hawaiian statuary, daily beach grooming, etc., etc.! Very impressive for such a large property.  If I was to offer one suggestion to the hotel it would be to add those wall-mounted makeup mirrors to the bathrooms. 'Bet they would be used and appreciated more than the Gameboy systems that are in each room. I was rather surprised that the Hilton didn't have such mirrors, in fact. The only negative I have about HHV -- and I'm uncertain if this is something that the Hilton even controls -- is that some salesladies in the jewelry stores on the hotel premises were EXTREMELY aggressive. What was to be an enjoyable afternoon window shopping was ruined by their pushy tactics and swarmy come-ons. Class-less acts at a classy hotel.

<Content>Best honeymoon ever-5 star review see our other 6 night stay review at the hilton waikoloa. as for our 6 nights on oahu, the hilton impressed-BIG TIME!(preface: we only stay at top resorts and love fine dining, we are avid travelers and are picky about hotels) that said, if you know the right buttons to push and go at the right time of year, this will be a fabulous hotel.facts:1. people who say ali tower is best are dillusional, you stay on waikiki for the views, and none better than the rainbow tower. ali tower has only slightly better amenities, if any. rainbow rooms have casually elegant beachy feel, BEST beds and linens, and are recently all rennovated (with higher floor diamond head facing rooms the best (large swiveling flat panels plasma TVs, best views, best wetbars) if you dont stay rainbow tower, DONT STAY. i wont give our room away but any room ending in 01 are the BEST...better than their $2K a night suites. i arranged a top floor double balcony 'suite' for our stay and we were absolutley mezmorized by the views, luxury and service. i am hilton gold VIP and made sure we got upgraded from a standard room as i used points for this stay. you just have to make sure you push for the room you want--call in advance if you have to. rainbow is also central to everything.2. pools great, beach THE BEST on waikiki as is the surfing spot. we went jan 25...all quiet, no crowds!!! we loved waikiki even better than the reknowned secluded beaches--maybe it was the time of year but it was idealic! lots of bars/restaraunts, but all classy. after reading the reviews that said this hotel is a madhouse, i am amazed how different the times you stay will make your vacation here. WE THOUGHT IT WAS MORE QUIET HERE THAN THE BIGISLAND!!!!!3. food=awesome! golden dragon chinese, round table pizza, CJs deli, etc...4. water=clear, lots of coral farther out, pebbly at waters edge, gold sand beach, incredible sunsets...wow.5. staff and housekeeping all 5 star6. grounds, cannot be explained, 5 star.tips:dinner at orchids, sunset catameran with outrigger, hike with samson at oahu nature tours, hanuma bay snorkeling.

<Content>Nice retreat from our rain We just returned...good trip. We have a 14, 11 yr old plus an 11 month baby. They upgraded us for free to an end room in TAPA tower....back garden view. huge room. difficult for a family of 5 to share one room, but it was ok. we didnt rent a car but should have. go to ALa Moana Shopping center and get groceries for the frig. everything is expensive, but this is typical. the only complaint is that the pool is not heated and a but chilly in january. this section of waikiki is a lot quieter than downtown. nice to be fully enclosed in a village with everyting right there. the teens could go on their own to explore and i felt it was safe. i would not have let them do this at other downtown hotels. the fridaya night show is perfect and we did this instead of a pricey long luau. it was just right for our family. the hotel was under some construction but not a real problem. we would return.

<Content>HHV is the best!!! My sisters and I (ages 22, 20, 20) stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for 5 nights in May. We absolutely loved the hotel! We didn't have any problems during our stay. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The grounds of the hotel are gorgeous and extremely well kept. They have animals such as penguins and flamingos. We stayed at the cheapest tower, the Tapa Tower, and we loved it! Since we belong to the Hilton Honors Club we had a quick check-in and we were upgraded to a partial ocean-view room. The room was clean and big enough for the three of us and the view was beautiful. Every night we sat out on our lanai and listened to the live band in the Tapa Bar. The only place we ate at the HHV was Round Table Pizza. It wasn't too expensive and the pizza was good. The HHV has the widest stretch of beach along Waikiki Beach and it was never crowded. On Friday nights the hotel has a fireworks show. We sat on the beach a little ways down from the hotel and we could see the fireworks perfectly above the ocean. The super pool was usually crowded but there was always a spot available at the Tapa Pool which was a little smaller but just as nice. The Kahuna Dog (a food stand right next to the Tapa Pool) was reasonably priced and their coconut shaved ice was really big and delicious!! We bought all of our breakfast foods and snacks at the ABC store in the hotel. The ABC store is a very inexpensive place to buy anything you need on your vacation :)(There is also an ABC store at every corner in Waikiki) Although the Hilton Hawaiian Village is located at the end of Waikiki Beach, it is still only a short walk to everything on Kalakaua Ave. We had absolutely no complaints whatsoever for the Hilton Hawaiian Village and we had the time of our lives!!! Everything at the HHV made our dream vacation come true!!! We also just booked our next trip at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for 10 days this May. We wouldn't think of staying anywhere else!!

<Content>ONE OF MY BEST VACATIONS-EVER I always knew that I was goint to stay at HHV because I like staying at upscale mega-resorts. My only problem was determing in which tower to stay in at HHV. Though the place appeared to be family friendly, I can only write about what my husband and I experienced (both in our 30's and avid travelers).First of all, yes Hawaii is expensive; but you get what you pay for. I was able to see rooms in all of the towers in HHV except the Tapa Tower. I saw a room on the 8th floor of the Kalia Tower. It is the newest tower and very nice but is furthest from the beach. The Mandara Spa is located here on the 4th Floor. The Diamond Head Tower is close to the beach but in my opinion, appeared to be a little run down. I saw a room on the 16th floor and the view was allright. The one bedrooms suites had a seperate living room but the bathroom was small. The rooms here are extremely large but need to be updated. The rooms in the Rainbow Tower are very close to the beach and have a restaurant located here. I saw a room with a partial ocean view on the 16th floor. The rooms appeared to be very nice and recently renovated (it was the first tower built on this property). The Alli Tower is right on the beach and is the most expensive tower of them all. I stayed here on the 10th floor in an ocean front room. These rooms have more amenities than the other towers including a private pool and hourdourves served nightly. The rooms feature sitting areas with flat screen TV's. Was it worth the extra money for the Alli Tower? If you can afford it, YES! If I don't have the extra money, I recommend the Rainbow Tower and then the Kalia Tower.The entire staff was helpful and courteous. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. I hope my reveiw helps:)

<Content>Money, Money, Money...MONEY! I read a lot of reviews here before we left for our Honeymoon at HHV and I knew to keep my expectations low and my hopes high for a room upgrade. My wife insisted we be on the beach and stay at a reputable hotel. Due to an unexpected, last minute, change in plans we had to paid for room-select. Which means we get what room is available at check-in, no guarantees...just roll the dice.Most people's complaints are valid. We stayed during peak holiday time Dec. 27-Jan. 4 (wife is a teacher) and were treated, at times, like just another lame touristy couple. However, House-keeping was always very pleasant. Lounge chairs by the super-pool (that is a joke) very limited, fought over, horded because they are free! Lounge chairs for the beach $12 dollars per and by the way the beach sand along and in the water is full of big rocks/reef! I am sorry but Waikiki beaches are lousy compared to lots of places(i.e the New Jersey shore if you can believe). The water is clear and a cool 72-75 degress. I prefer the caribean's 80's when I am wading, floating, and relaxing. The weather was beautiful for the first 4 days...not a cloud in the sky!The food at most of the resturants is mostly average and always way overpriced. I suggest go out side of the grounds for breakfast and lunch. Try the Wailana Coffee House across the street. Fill your room frig. with drinks and snacks from any of the miriad of ABC stores. A Walmart, I read, is a 10minute walk near Ala mona park for cheap beach chairs.Our up-graded deluxe ocean view honeymoon room was clean but the view was bad. Room 304 is the first floor in the Rainbow tower and it looks out at the harbor parking lot and abandoned lagoon. However, the wicked sunset view from just beyond the railing, when I crained my neck and leaned over, was a big plus and something I have to remind myself of when I feel like I spent too much.Alcohol drinks are $11.95. Twice what they should cost, but maybe I am being cheap.Overall, we spent a lot of money for paradise and I guess that is to be expected. Bottom-line stay somewhere else and just walk around the Hilton Hawaian Village as if you have a room...its too big a place for anyone to notice or care and the penguins keep hush.

<Content>Still spinning with delight After reading many of the reviews written months prior to our 12day stay,we were somewhat anxious that we had made the right choice--However no need to worry we had a fantastic time(family of 6 including Grandmother and 15,17,20year old) After a not so comfortable 10 hour trip, our welcome was overwhelming,smiles and leis at the airport,more welcome smiles and greetings at reception with wonderful glasses of fruit punch being constantly offered. We were in the Rainbow Tower ,great views,morning noon and night,which we really appreciated even though we live at home mtrs from the beach-- the rooms were a little smaller than anticipated, but spotless and the soft beds were divine. Housekeeping were fantastic and really looked after us. We had breakfast at the Rainbow tower, service was great, and to be greeted by name each morning was really nice.Special thanks to Sue-- Food --who could wish for a greater variety.The gardens, the shops,the entertainment,the service were all excellent. Its true everything is more expensive at the village,but if it doesn't suit there are heaps of other options all within walking distance. We should have stayed longer, perhaps next year.

<Content>Typical Hilton --- :-( My family(wife, 18 son, 16 daughter) and I are avid travelers to hawaii, at least twice to three times a year. We are from the chicago area so we always excited to leave. We typically stay at the Manderine Oriental or the Halekulani but we heard so many great things about the Hilton Villige we just had to se for our self.Well let me just say from the start it was no picnic. The front drive through where the limo let us off was unbelievably packed, and with not enough bell staff we had to wait nealry 30 MIN for them to come and take our luggage. UNACCEPTABLEAfter waiting in the long airport-like line to check-in we were told that since we supose to be in at 11 but we were in at 1230 (b/c of an airplane delay and the outside wait) that they gave our suite ($825 p/n) in the ALI'I tower away!They acted graciously and said that they had the same type aroom available in the Kalia tower at the same rate.After wondering the property for a while we found the building hiding in the back of the resort.After getting to the suite--room we opened the door and to our dismay it was just a standrd room with a view of a top of a building w/ maintnence machines.We called down and infomed them of the mistake. they claimed that was the only available room. we then talked to the manager, who upgraded us to a suite in the same tower w/ a city view at the same cost. which is rediculous b/c that is the budget tower! That suite should of been no more that 600 tops. We spent the night (b/c it was late) and moved to the mandarine oriental where we were treated like royalty.STAY AWAY

<Content>More or less full service resort HHV is a solid full service resort. There are several room types, many restaurants, shopping, and other activities. We stayed in the Kalia Tower, using Hilton points. It was a pleasant stay. This is a resort for people who like lots of people around. The restaurants had fairly average Hilton restaurant food. I would not eat there unless I had to. We were disappointed that neither of the Japanese restaurants were open; we were looking forward to sushi, Hawaiian style. We ended up leaving the resort for most meals.The spa services at the Kalia Tower were excellent. On the ladies' side, there was a lovely outdoor lounge area with lots of fun magazines. The steam room did not function correctly because the door did not fit.At Thanksgiving weekend, the pool lounges and beach lounges were available. I do not mind paying for a beach lounge; pool lounges were free. Towels were unlimited. Several people have discussed paying for coffee and safes. We did not experience this. However, at the price of the rooms and the fact that the service is there, I am surprised that a charge would be made.

<Content>Excellent use of Hotel Points for free nights! We used our hilton honors points for free nights at this hotel and it was the best use of our points EVER. Excellent place, although so large, we got lost a few times. I would love to go back and stay again. Stayed in 3 hotels on an 8 day vacation and this was the best overall place.

<Content>unhappy with service we paid in full for a room with double beds back in oct 05 and got a room with a king and rollaway bed when we checked in dec 26 06. overbooked! resulting in a bad experience for 7 nights. no room change due to high season. checking in took 30 mins or more and the clerk had to check with managment in the back room several times. the hotel advertizes for 5 swimming pools but not all 5 are available to everyone. they are reserved to guests of particular tower. 2 sea view restaurants do not really have a sea view since they are at the same level as the sea, should be at a higher level so the view will be more apparent. swimming pools do not have enough lounge chairs and no umbrellas. if you want to stay in the shade, you'll need to rent an umbrella at the beach. cost is 51 for umbrella and 2 lounge chairs. service people are rude. they tend to be arrogant and impatient. their answers are short and their body language is offending. beach is rocky. you'll need beach shoes to walk on the beach or get into the water. for the amount we paid for the room we expect excellent service all around. reserving an airport shuttle is a complex task, seems like bell service does not talk to concierge or 'shuttle girl'

<Content>Never again! If you want to spend your vacation worrying whether you are being scalped for each service you need, if you are looking for rude behavior by many of the hotel's staff-this is the place for you. I say: never again. The unplesantness of this hotel was much in contrast to the beauty of the place. It started with a poor execution of my reservation request and apparent confirmation, and it pretty much contnued all through the week we stayed there. If you want to purchase something no single person will advise you to go to a place outside the village; even if you could save 400% (as was the case with the development of film). Management needs to refocus here on what matters--giving high paying customers (our room cost on average around $400) a feeling of respect and good service!

<Content>Pros and cons We spent a long Christmas weekend at the Hilton. This is the second year in a row we have spent Christmas there. Cons: (1) there is construction ongoing. Our long-ago booked room in the Ali'a tower was overlooking it. Upon arrival, I requested a different room. Initially the front desk clerk suggested that I should have known about the construction because it is noted online. I stated that I did not know, and suggested that she see how long ago our reservation was made online. End of discussion. Our room was moved to a nicer room without additional charge. (2) My 14 year old had a sports massage appointment. She disclosed her age when she made the appointment. She checked in (again age was mentioned because I had to accompany her). Only when the massage therapist was ready to take her and realized that she needed a bigger room (because I had to be present) did the spa director inform us that the minimum age was 16. Three spa staff members did not know the age requirement. (3) The 2 restaurants in which we have eaten the past 2 years, the Rainbow room and the steak restaurant miss with their food. I was reminded of how much they miss when we had an early and truly wummy lunch at the Cheesecake Factory on December 26th for half the price.Pros: lovely resort, attentive staff.

<Content>Great Trip! My husband, myself and our 10 year old son just returned from seven wonderful nights (December 12-19) at the HHV and had a very positive experience. I would recommend this hotel to anyone except those who are looking for a secluded, do nothing kind of vacation. Honolulu is a big city, and there is always something to do! Our positive experience began at the airport check-in kiosk where the HHV attendant was extremely friendly and gave us an upgrade to an ocean front room on a high floor of the Rainbow tower. We are Hilton Honors Diamond members and were very happy with the upgrade. We also recieved our free continental breakfast coupons. You can take the free continental, which is breakfast pastry, juice or fruit and coffee, or for a few more dollars upgrade to the buffet or full breakfast. If you are not huge breakfast eaters, like us, the served free continental was great. We only ate at the resort a few times during the week other than breakfast. Benihana was good, but crowded, so make a reservation. Our son loved the Round Table pizza, which you can order and have delivered out by the pool. Our room in the Rainbow tower had the most magnificent view of the ocean, Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head. The room itself was nothing special, but was always clean. In addition to the mini bar, however, they do provide a nice little fridge. I would trade the Ali'i or Kalia Tower's newer rooms for this view anyday. It all depends on your preferences. We walked out of our elevators either into the pool or onto the beach. Awesome. We spent most of our time on the beach, but when we did go to the pool, we found three chairs together. The beach and the pool were both filled with people, but we never felt crowded or overwhelmed by the numbers. We made use of the fridge by stocking it with snacks and beverages we purchased outside the resort. There is a Wal-Mart two blocks behind the Ala Moana center, a short cab ride away ($7). I would recommend stopping there early in your trip for supplies. We also purchased three beach chairs and an umbrella for use on the beach. It is significantly cheaper than renting at the HHV beach which is about $50/day for chairs and umbrella. At the end of our vacation, we left the chairs with other vacationers. There are also ABC stores on just about every corner. They are comperable to a convenience store at a tourist destination. Toiletries, sundries, snacks, etc., but at a bit of a premium. We did not notice any of the locals shopping in there. The HHV is a very large resort hotel with numerous restaurants, shops and varied ameneties. There are actually more shops and restaurants than some small town malls. As with any resort, the prices will be higher than those elsewhere, but just do a little research before your trip and you can enjoy window shopping at the resort and purchasing somewhere else. The Ala Moana shopping center, a short Bus ride, $6 taxi ride, or 15 minute walk away, is like a mall anywhere else, except you can pick up all the great souvenier items that you want to bring home. I would recommend Hilo Hattie's, kind of a one-stop Hawaiian kitsch store. There are also some great restaurants in the Ala Moana center, Asaggio's Italian being our favorite. You can get a mall guide online to check out your restaurant options.I would also recommend a visit to the Ward Center where there are great shops and restaurants. It is just West of the Ala Moana center, and you'll want to cab (about $8) or Bus there. The Waialaia Coffee house does have cheap, satisfying food, and its a short walk across the street. There is also a great diner at the corner of Kalakua and Ala Moana St. called Eggs n Things. Only about two blocks from the hotel.As for the hotel activities, take in the King's Jubilee on Friday for the show and fireworks. Use the Kid's club. They are great with the kiddos and keep them really busy. There are penguin feedings at 8am  3pm every day. It is fun  fascinating to watch and listen. The HHV grounds really are a destination onto themselves. We used the Mandara spa and Kalia pool twice and had wonderful spa treatments.We did some research before our trip and decided to rent a car for two of our eight days. It was perfect. There is a Dollar rental car on Kalakua about two blocks behind the hotel. We drove the island, visited the North Shore, snorkled at Hanaluma Bay, visited Pearl Harbor and ate at Roy's on the way to Hanaluma. Pricy, but among the best meals I've ever eaten. The Diamond Head climb is really exhilarating and the view from the top is certainly worth the work. One of our main concerns regarding this trip were the reviews we had read about the service at HHV. We found the service to be comperable to that of the rest of Oahu. Slow, sometimes incomplete, but overall pretty friendly. We travel quite extensively, and will definitely return to the HHV. As with any vacation, there were things that we were not happy with, but we always view our trips as a whole, and overall, the HHV was a destination worth visiting again and again.

<Content>Great family spot Our family of six (mom, dad plus kids aged 14, 13, 10 and 9) stayed in the Rainbow Tower on the 27th floor for 3 nights in November. We had two connecting rooms with a total of 3 balconies overlooking the city, Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach. What a spot!We chose this hotel because we had accumulated so many Hilton Honors points but weren't quite sure what we'd end up with considering it was such a large facility. We were delighted with the spaciousness of the rooms (1 king connecting to 2 doubles). The bathrooms were small, adequate, but in need of updating. The Rainbow Tower was just right for us.We spent much of our three days there touring the island of Oahu (before we went to Maui for some RR)so the time spent at the resort itself was minimal. The breakfast buffet was good but we found that it got quite crowded if you arrived after 8am. The big pool looked like fun but it closed earlier than we would have liked for the nightly shows that are performed there. There were many shops and restaurant options on-site but we chose to eat and shop elsewhere along Waikiki Beach.All in all, a very good spot for our family.

<Content>AWESOME HOTEL!!! WE HAD THE BEST HONEYMOON!!! The first thing that made our trip special was the fact that we were in our honeymoon, but as you know... honeymoons can go wrong too, but fortunately that wasn't our case. My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for five nights, and this was just the beginning of a wonderful time together. First of all, the hotel is in a great location, and the views are very nice. As soon as we got to the resort, we noticed the great customer service from the staff. We stayed at the Ali'i Tower, the more private and supposedly nice building, usually recommended to honeymooners. We loved the room we had with an awesome ocean view. It was clean and spacious. The resort itself was very big, with lots of restaurants and shops, a little bit expensive though, but you don't have to buy anything to enjoy the beauty of the place. Denny's is near there, as well as some other places to eat. If you want to spend some money in a very romantic dinner inside the resort, go to Bali by the Sea, expensive, but very nice!!!!! I also recommend Sergio's, the Italian restaurant.I definitely have no complaints about the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We could have been lucky, I don't know... but the fact is that I had a great time in this place. If you're going on your honeymoon, I truly recommend the Ali'i Tower, the only building with its own pool and jacuzzi! After O'ahu, we went to Maui... a beautiful PARADISE!!!!

<Content>Need to refocus... I just got back from 5 days at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I was there 4 years ago and had a good time but this time things have definately gone down hills.The room was nicely decorated but unchanged from 4 years ago. The wooden doors under the sink were misfitting. There were cockroaches in the bathroom... killed a handful everyday.The service was spotty. Several good experiences but they really need to hire better valet parking guys. Inattentive... I didn't even get any help putting my bags into the car upon check out. I had the feeling that it was their first day on their first job ever.We ate several meals there. At all costs avoid the buffet restaurant and the Italian place. Both with extremely poor food and service. The buffet restaurant had meals that were overcooked and fresh out of the heater.. probably was served earlier that day. Every single one of the serving plates had broken latches. Come on guys, at $35 per person you can afford new serving plates. The award winning Italian restaurant had noisy groups, inattentive service and Spagatti factory quality pasta/ lamb. Would have done better eating at Denny's. I was very tempted to stiff the waiters with no tip.The Tropics sandwich shop was as good as ever with quick service and quality sandwiches. The New York style deli was also very good. The Japanese restaurants in the resorts were only fair... I expected much better from a community with a significant Japanese population. Most of the Japanese tourist we saw ate noodles from the ABC mart instead of dining at any of the restaurants... They definately got a better deal if not a better meal.We stayed here because of our excellent stay last time and because of the beach and pool which are still excellent. But because of the worsening quality of the service and food. I would not recommend the Hilton to anyone at this time. The other advantage of the Hilton with its large resort choices to include restaurants were negated with the lower quality standard and over inflated prices.

<Content>Excellent stay We just got back home yesterday from a fantastic stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The resort is wonderful. I've read so many different reviews, that before I left I was a little worried. We stayed in the Ali'i tower so I don't know if the tower makes a difference. Our tower was very clean, nice, updated (flat screen TV). Housekeeping was great. Came three times a day. Once to clean, make beds ecetra, afternoon to fill your ice bucket, and early evening to put out chocolates, a flower and to see if you need anything. The doorman (one in particular) was so nice. Always saying Welcome Home. What a nice touch. The resort itself is very nice, clean, lots of restaurants and shops. Be careful with the shopping. Your best bet is to hit the Aloha Stadium on Wed., Sat., or Sun. for the Swap Meet. Best Prices we found! Benihana was terrific. Great service and food was wonderful. We also ate at the Rainbow Lania on a Sat. nite for the Buffet. One of the best buffets I've every had. And, I usually don't do buffets. They had prime rib, crab legs plus lots more. So at $31 a person (yes pricey, But..) great food, and the kids ate free. On the other hand, we had reservations to eat at the Village Steak and Seafood. We went there (a Wed.) and they were closed! Why the girl took my reservation I have no idea! I was a little more then miffed about this as we were celebrating my daughters b-day. But, the concierge got us reservations at Benihana in 10 mins! (We had already been there...but that was OK like I said good food). They have a small program each nite around the super pool. Nice. Nothing Special, but nice. However Fri. nite they do a Kings Jubilee, more entertainment (very good) a parade kids can be in (and they receive a 5x7 free picture). It costs $12 per person to get a seat, and that includes 1 drink. I figured the free pic helped offset the high price. So if you have kids not to bad. Plus, they had fireworks which were great. We sat next to people who had been there before and they said the fireworks were they best they have seen there. Wondering if Christmas approaching had anything to do with it. The pool is nice and big, but like everyone says....very hard to get a chair. If we couldn't find one, to leave our stuff on we just went to the beach and tried later. We went to the beach and pool both each day. Eventually you can spot a chair. But, with as many towers and only 100 or so chairs this will always be a complaint I'm sure. As far as the staff. They are friendly. They aren't out of the way friendly, but OK. At the swap meet they could be rude, actually mostly rude if you didn't buy from them, or in my case my daughter would touch something and they really Got their panties in a wad, what my kids would say to me! O.K. RENT A CAR! You have to get out of Waikiki and see Hawaii! Even the locals will tell you this. Go to the North Shore, and around the island. Get out and see the place! Not just the resort. You can stay in a hotel anywhere, so go and see the beauty of this wonderful island. I know I'm all over the place with this, I'm just trying to give the best tips I can while it's fresh. Across from the Hilton is the Wilana Coffee Shop. Decent food and very cheap. Kids eat for $1.95 a meal. Overall we didn't think the food in Hawaii in general was fantastic, but being from the Midwest in the land of beef it's hard to match. We also found food to be alot cheaper away from Waikiki. Also ask where the Wal-mart is. We went there and bought milk and ceral and saved a ton of $ on eating breakfast in our room. I bought a book on Ohau before leaving on tips and it provided alot of information, highly recommend doing this. Oh and always ask for the upgrade. Our room was supposed to be partial ocean view. I asked for an ocean view if possible. And they made if possible! It was an awesome view! Yes we would return to the Hilton! No matter where you stay they will be some sort of complaint. Be it big or small. So, looking at the big picture this was a fabulous place to stay and worth every penny.

<Content>Loved the HHV My husband, 2 children (7  3), and I stayed here in May, 2005 for 2 weeks in the Alli Tower. We loved the resort and the island as well. The resort was large and imposing but we liked that because there were a lot of shops and amenities and you could blend in and not really be bothered. Rooms: It is true what they say, if you can afford the Alli Tower stay there. We did and it was well worth the extra money. The rooms had a large (about 32) flat panel LCD Tv in every room, there was even a mini TV in the bathroom. The beds were heavenly, with thick duvets and large comfy down pillows. There was a separate dressing/makeup area that is outside the bathroom area with a large vanity, sink and mirror, so two people could be getting ready at the same time. The only down side to the rooms were they were looking a little worn. In one corner the wallpaper was peeling, there were scuff marks by the door nothing major but over all a little lack lustre. They are in the process of renovating all rooms in the Alli Tower right now (according to thier website) and they are scheduled to be finished by Feb 2006. Another thing that bothered me about the rooms was the housekeeping. They did a fine job cleaning the room but we had 4 people in the room. When we asked to have our towels changed most times they only gave us 3 bath towels so someone would have to use a just used wet towel. After 2 kids spending a day at the beach yuck! Also, they put chocolates on the pillows during turndown service. I always look forward to retiring to the room at night and having that little treat, but when you have 2 children and they only give you 2 chocolates the kids get the chocolates and the parents get nothing. I would ask for 4 chocolates and 4 bath towels, sometimes they would leave them for us, most times not. It became a real pain calling housekeeping for an extra bath towel. It's the little things that make service outstanding.Alli Tower in General: Overall the Alli tower was great. The front desk service was quite good. A couple times when we reviewed our account on the TV we found a couple of discrepancies in our account, but they were taken care of immediately. The concierge was quite knowledgable and helped us many times. We loved the hors d'oeuvres upstairs by the pool, they had quite a good selection. We weren't expecting much when we went on our first night and were very pleasantly surprised. They had a good selection of fruit and veggies with dip, and hot foods such as chicken skewers as well. It was something that we looked forward too, every evening we would buy a drink (lava flows are really good and all drinks are topped with orchids)and have hors d'oeuvres while we watched the hula show down by the pool or just stared out over the ocean. The pool at the Alli tower is just for the guests in that tower. It is open later(till 8pm)than the super pool so it is nice for an evening swim and there is a hot tub in one corner that overlooks the ocean. One night the 4 of us sat up in the hot tub, no one else was there and we watched fire eaters putting on a show down on the beach. It was pure heaven.The resort: The resort is a very beautiful place. The gardens and the fish ponds are incredible. The penguins and flamingos kept the kids interested. The super pool is quite cold and you have to be there very early to get a chair. I also did not like the idea that we had to pay through the nose for beach chairs and umbrellas. I think it was $20/umbrella and $20/chair, or something like that per day. It shouldn't cost $100 to get beach chairs at the resort. The food on the resort was good, we especially liked the breakfast buffet at the Rainbow Lanai. Get there early though or you will have to wait for a table, everyone else likes the breakfast there too. Another good place to eat is Round Table Pizza, the pizza was excellent and quite cheap. $25.00 got you a large pizza smothered in toppings, try the Hawaiian, no one does it better. When we arrived in our cab from the airport we were removing our luggage and got yelled at for the cab being in the way even though I didn't feel that he was. I also wanted to know why we were getting asked, no, yelled at to move our cab, perhaps some guests might need to be checking in at the resort? The resort can be a spendy place but if you carefully prepare and don't get too lured in by the shops you can keep your costs down. Another thing, they do cater to the Japanese tourists there. They have these special open air trams that we tried to get on once but were told they were private. Didn't understand that since it was stopping at the bus stop and it was full of Japanese tourists. Most things were within walking distance anyway. Downtown is within walking distance, it is about a 10 minute walk, try going along the beach boardwalk it is a nice walk. Also Ala Moana Mall is a close walk, about 10 min in the opposite direction. If you want do a lot of shopping that is the place to go.Overall: The whole island is incredibly beautiful, and the resort matched it. It was like they tried to make the resort rival the beauty of the island. We rented a car for 8 days and explored every coast and every nook and cranny of the island. Things that we really liked were Pearl Harbour, the Polynesian Cultural Center, Sea Life park, and if you get a chance drive to the North Shore. There isn't alot to do on the North Shore but it captures the essence of Hawaii. You can sit on beautiful beaches and watch the surfers, it is what I envisioned old Oahu to be like. Also go to Matsumotos on the North Shore for Shave Ice, its a nice treat. Also try Dukes at the Outrigger Reef hotel, it's a Waikiki icon. All in all loved the resort, loved the island, want to go back and will go back, hopefully very soon.

<Content>No Good I'm still fuming. We had a bad stay last February, and it was so bad, I can't help writing again. I keep reading all the latest reviews and it does seem like there is a pattern. During the winter months, the height of the tourist season, it seems like service suffers at this hotel to the point where the staff are no longer courteous and downright rude. We paid so much for our trip, that we were very unhappy that we were screamed at by the valet parking when we pulled up to the curb to check in and were told to move our car! Not the warm welcome you hope to receive after traveling from the East Coast and arriving for some pampering and much needed rest. It is such a change from previous years which also makes me angry. Seems like the meal prices are so astronomical, they're trying to gouge you. Paying for umbrellas and chairs to use the beach is lousy when you pay so much for the room. These should be complimentary (???). You've paid thru the nose for them already. Am very concerned, because I don't think the alternative hotels are much better, certainly they don't look as nice. I guess I feel like the Hilton needs to take a closer look at how they are treating guests. We never even got an apology for the rude behavior or any free bottle of champagne or anything when they lost our reservations and we had to wait four hours to check in, then stay in two rooms on two different floors instead of neighboring rooms that we had reserved. It's gone so far down hill, my fear is that it will continue. Guess it's time to check out other vacation spots. Too bad, I have such fond memories of this island and previous vacation ventures here.

<Content>Great Place to Stay in Waikiki We had a great week long stay the HHV. The rooms were very nice, the facilities well maintained and overall everyone was very friendly. Our room was in the Tapa Tower. It was very large. We had friends staying in the Diamond Head Tower. It was decorated nicer with newer furnishings etc, but was consderably smaller. The Tapa pool was little cold being little sun hits this area. The super pool was very comfortable. It is hard getting a chair at this pool as they allow people to get them early in the morning and leave a towel there to hold the chair. The beach is right near by and is very nice.The animals on this resort are great for children as well as adults. The penguins, birds, etc. are great. The gentleman, Kevin, that takes care of the animals is a wonderful person who obviously cares about each animal on the property. He is weatlth of knowledge of the animals.We also appreciated them allowing us the use of a hospitality room the day we checked out. Our plane didn't leave until 7:20 p.m. (check out is 11 a.m.) and they gave us a room to use at no charge for an hour late in the afternoon to shower and prepare for our flight.While the resort is very large with lots of guests, it was perfect for us. We loved our week long stay here and will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Beautiful, but not the usual Hilton courtesy The firt night we stayed in the Ali'i Tower. Luxurious room with coffee, mini fridge, bar (extra$) and bottled water. This tower has a doorman, private check in/out desk, concierge, pool and hot tub which are not shared by the other guests. Nice touch for over $200 per night. The remainder of the trip (6 nights) my husband and I were in the Tapa Tower. Room located on the 33rd floor, very clean overlooking the pool, Diamond Head and the ocean. Recommend an upper floor for the view. Only one packet of coffee. We had to keep calling to get one packet per day. Mini-fridge and bar (exta$) were handy to have for the week. Tapa pool closed at 10pm. Other pools closed much earlier at 5-6pm. Cleaning staff very friendly, but that's where it stopped. Most guests were Japanese and we felt it catered to this audience. The restaurants were overpriced. Thanksgiving buffet was $48 per person. Ala carte dinner at the other 2 restaurants were the same price. Regular buffet dinner was $31 without seafood or carving station. Make reservations for the various restaurants on your first day or you may end up eating at 9-10pm like we did. More reasonably-priced places to eat outside of the hotel are in walking distance. Hotel property was simply beautiful and the beach was the nicest in Waikiki. Plush beach towels available at the beach at no charge . We ended up renting a car for 3 days to sight see. The hotel has trolly and bus stops which are convenient, but we didn't want to wait and shuffle. Hertz is located in the Tapa Tower, very convenient and worth the extra parking cost of $15 per night. Business center is located in the Diamond Head tower and was also very convenient to quickly check email, print boarding passes and weigh your luggage. Hotel provided coupon book for various hotel vendors which was helpful. Saving a few dollars here and there didn't quite make up for the 30 minute bar wait by the pool, but it was thoughtful. The hotel has many designer shops which are extremely expensive. If you're looking for souveniors (tikis, jewelry, shirts, mugs, etc.) go to the International Market. You can haggle there also. Hotel also offers several free services such as hula and snorkeling lessons, but you have to sign up in advance; space is limited. Friday night King show at the super pool was very nice. Get there by 5pm. $12 for pool seating includes a drink and fireworks is worth it. We utilized the Concierge to book our first few activities. It was convenient, but not informative. Concierge booked the best and most expensive without discussion. We then used the American Express Travel desk located in the main lobby and were much more pleased with the communication. Attend the hotel orientation. You get great tips on places to visit and a free breakfast. Be aware the hotel offers timeshare properties. You may be solicited. We said no and were not bothered again. The hotel has everything, but it's too large and the restaurants are not great. You don't receive any personal attention. I would stay there again because I know what to expect (I read many reviews). If I didn't, I would have been very disappointed, not the usual Hilton courtesy.

<Content>Uneven Service, Too Crowded My husband and I just spent two nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Overall, the service was mixed, and it was too crowded. I am a Diamond HHonors member, but did not feel that welcome there. (Perhaps Hilton hotels have spoiled me--usually I find their service to be exceptional--this was a disappointment.) We stayed in the Kalia Tower, but were not assigned to an ocean view room. The mountain view was still pretty. We had access to the executive lounge, but it was not worth it. They served complimentary snacks from 5-7 pm, but you had to pay for drinks there, and they were more expensive than the mini-bar in the hotel room! The lounge was also extremely crowded--it was hard to find a seat. Moreover, we received a call from the front desk that we needed to pick up our breakfast coupons that they forgot to give us when we checked in. They didn't offer to have someone bring them to our room; they didn't even offer to walk them over to the Kalia Tower to leave with the conceirge there. When we got to the front desk (a considerable walk from Kalia Tower), they said we didn't need the coupons. We had to insist that they had called us to pick them up; they finally found them for us after about 10 minutes. While this property is located on the beach, if you stay in Kalia Tower, it is quite a walk to the beach because the hotel grounds are sprawling. There is a Doubletree hotel literally within a five-minute walk from the Kalia Tower, so HHonors members staying at the Doubletree don't have much further to walk to the beach than those in Kalia Tower. I would like to note, however, that some of the staff were friendly (such as when we checked out, and at the restaurant Bali by the Sea). The food at Bali was great too.

<Content>Had a wonderful 8 day stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Thoroughly enjoyed the 8 day stay here from November 8 through the 15th. Room extremely clean and comfortable..Have not had a more comfortable bed anywhere. We stayed in Rainbow Tower which is the closest to beach and we had an ocean view that was beautiful. Even tho at check in the clerk told us it was a partial ocean view it truly was more than that!! My friend had a Senior Hilton Honors card and we got this wonderful room for $203.00 per night. Food is expensive at the hotel in most restaurants but we ate at other local restaurants so we did not have to spend a lot of money for food while in Honolulu. However, on the Hilton property there are many shops and small places to eat one of which is the pizza place and they have great salads, pizza, sandwiches and drinks. This fare was very tasty  reasonable and the place stayed very busy each time we were in there. Location of HHV is very good; shuttle and taxi service is convenient, staff usually nice, helpful, attentive. I would definitely stay here again!!!! P.S., Enjoyed looking at all of the shops on property and the manicured grounds are full of beautiful flowers and wonderful birds, penguins, ducks and the like. Place is almost a city unto itself!!

<Content>Excellent Stay Spent only 1 night in the Kahlia tower on the executive floor. I found the staff to be top notch, very friendly and professional. The room in the Kahlia tower was newly built and very luxurious, with a small patio and a great view out to sea. The resort is very large with many shops and a great selection of restaurants. We chose to leave the property and go next door for dinner to Kobe Steakhouse, well worth the walk. Over all this is a great resort for either a stop over before your Hawaiian vacation or even a week long visit. Expect resort prices for food and drink, but good quality.

<Content>We loved our stay Our stay at the village was great. The service from all the staff, from the guest services to housekeeping to the bars and restaurants was outstanding. I would recommend this place in a minute; we can't wait to go back. We stayed in the Tapa Tower, and our room was a terrific size, and really clean. If we needed anything, a one-touch call to guest services was all we had to do. The hotel is great for couples and families alike; it was just my wife and I, but there was a good mix of both. You'll love the penguins, flamingos, and koi, who are in the many ponds and lagoons. As you can probaly tell, I'd give it five stars. The best hotel stay I've ever had

<Content>HHV was just terrific We stayed for 6 days and were very nervous about crowds and expense because of reviews here. We thought that for being fully booked, with 3,000 rooms, they did an incredible job of making you feel there was no one there. We kept asking where all the people were. Yes, the pool chairs book quickly, but we never had a problem getting a couple. The hotel is within walking or free trolley ride to the rest of Waikiki, the staff was friendly to us, our room was upgraded upon arrival. Recognize that you are going to Hawaii and will need to leave your budget at home. But here are some hints if you are dollar conscious - bring your own coffee and filters, don't rent beach chairs if you have a problem with the price - sit on a towel on the prettiest (and most uncrowded)part of Waikiki beach, buy your own alcohol at ABC and have drinks on your lanai while enjoying HHV's free sunset music. We'd go back to HHV in a heartbeat.

<Content>Best Vacation Ever This was our first visit to any of the Hawaiian Islands and it was a wonderful experience. The HHV was beautiful and relaxing. Everything was very clean and well maintained. The restaurants are very expensive, however, you can eat off of the resort at a more reasonable price. There are restaurants within walking distance. We had a rental car and did a lot of sightseeing. I recommend getting the rental car, that way you can stop and see what you want. We saw some tour buses just slowing down as they drove past some areas of interest. The ABC Stores are great for souveniers and snacks. They have anything that you will need. We definetly would like to return to HHV.

<Content>1st Time in Hawaii Just got back from 5 nights on Oahu staying at the Hilton Village. We were scheduled to go to Cancun but, well...Wilma took care of that. We had to book an alternate vacation quickly and used I used this site to get a lot of useful info ASAP so I wanted to give something back.We traveled with another couple and we were both upgraded upon check-in which, by the way, we conveniently did at the airport kiosk. We had each booked ocean view rooms in the Kalia tower - they got upgraded to a gorgeous corner (read two balcony) room in the Rainbow tower, while we were given an ocean view Suite in the Diamond Tower. While we commented to management that we should have been kept in the same tower it didn't detract from the visit.Yes food is expensive at the village but it's expensive in Hawaii. Many have mentioned the coffee shop across the street. It was great! I'd even get take out breakfast and eat back in the room on the balcony. I'd recommend the muesli and the eggs bendict. Another great alternative is the military resort next door - you can only access it from the beach if you're not staying there. But a cheeseburger for lunch was only $2.50 vs the Hilton's $7.50 version. But in the Villge, the veal parmigian at Sergio's was the best I've had in years (not an easy compliment from an Italian NY girl) and the Beggar's Chicken at the Chinese restaurant on property was amazing.The beach here was nice - larger than many others down toward Waikiki and swimmable (ie. no coral reefs to cut your feet on). The last day we even rented the chair umbrella combo at the next beach because it was cheaper by $20. Same with surf lessons - they were 1/2 the price at Hans' surf school a few hotels down than at the Hilton. So why stay here??? It is convenient. It wasn't so crowded during Monday-Friday. Pretty grounds. They were kind to give us a hospitality suite to use for FREE before our late evening departure - 20 minutes per person - enough to shower after a long day on the beach. And the beds - it was like sleeping on a cloud. I'm going out to buy a good quality bed topper because it was nirvana to sleep here.Don't go to Honolulu if you don't like crowds or a metropolitan experience!E-mail if you have any questions. Aloha!

<Content>brilliant hotel, location, but i'v no money left To cut a long story short, we had to stay here as our holiday agent Premier neglected to tell us of the major building work that was taking place at our original hotel The Outrigger Reef on the beach, until 13 days to go! Good start to my dream honymoon with my new wife! After maxing my credit card to afford the upgrade they point blank lied to us and said they new nothing of building works LOL and refused to help us. We arrived at the Hilton, O my lord it was posh, mind you im a bloke that usually pays 拢13 BB and thinks its a rip off lol. Anyway back to the hotel. It is absolutly brilliant, the staff are distant but very friendly when approached (though being british we kept ourselfs to ourselfs). The views are great and they have lots of shops were you can stare and dream at owning the products. They have 17 restaurants/diners to eat in, although very expensive for a once in a lifetime thing its highly worth it. I may be poor but i know me food! I work in hotels as a manager and sample lots of cuisine. So let me tell you its good nosh lol. I could never afford to stay again or get married again at that, but if I could I'd be on that low budget airline with me knees in me face for 12 hours at a drop of a hat. Its not cheap(around 拢40 each) for a meal in one of several restaurants but they made my honeymoon special. You even get a free book in your room by Mr Hilton himself, mind you it tells the story of his rise to fortune! But hay beets a bible. Well done Mr Hilton and thanks for making my wifes dreams come true X

<Content>Hotel with terrible management! I was at the hilton in Waikiki for 10 days. The staff is friendly, but from what I could tell, they seemed to be scrutinized at every turn. I noted 3 instances where they were belittled in front of guests by supervisors or managers. Very unprofessional. Management there should be canned. The whole ordeal makes for a pins  needles type atmosphere. I'd recommend going down the street to the Sheraton, Hyatt, Hawaii Prince, or the beautiful Sheraton Moana Surfrider hotels. They're all in Waikiki and about the same cost. The hilton also needs more signs. There are no signs pointing to the different towers or facilities. And one of my biggest complaints was there is ONLY ONE atm machine on the 25 or so acres there. And it's located at THE FAR END near the street! Wanna eat and need a atm? It's a 15 minute walk there and back! My advice, stay elsewhere...

<Content>Liked it better the first time This was our second visit to the HHV, and both times we stayed in the Ali'i tower. Our first visit in '01 was fantastic, but this trip just wasn't as enjoyable. Maybe it's because we had just spent 4 nights on Maui which is considerably less crowded and more laid back. I've heard Honolulu refered to as a concrete jungle and after having visited Maui I would agree. The Ali'l tower is nice, but I question as to whether it is worth the money. Especially since during our visit, the 2nd floor of the hotel is under construction. So in order to reach the private pool  terrace on the 2nd floor, you were forced to detour to the 3rd floor and walk down a flight of concrete stairs in a humid, smelly stench. It was hardly the upscale atmosphere one expects from the Ali'i tower. Our partial ocean view was laughable. We overlooked the super pool, penguins, flamingos  koi ponds. And if you stretched your neck far enough you could see a sliver of the Pacific Ocean obstructed by many palm trees. Our 2 year old loved looking down at the animals and really the view was nice. However, it was not an ocean view or even a parital ocean view in my opinion and definitely not worth the extra $$. Speaking of money, expect to pay big time for any food on the property. The Ali'i tower offered complimentary Hors d'Oeuvres each evening, and on occasion that would suffice for dinner. They offer a continental breakfast at a nominal charge of $14. Hardly what I would consider nominal. Fourteen bucks for fruit, pastries, muffins, donuts  juice is steep in my book. We tried the breakfast buffet at both the Tapa Cafe  the Rainbow Lanai. Both were marginal. Very undercooked scrambled eggs at both buffets  both catered to the numerous Japanese tourists who prefer breakfast selections (like raw eggs in the shell  raw fish) that I would never eat. If you're thinking bountiful buffets like you'd find in Las Vegas, you'll be disappointed. At $20 per person, it was not worth it at all. It's one thing to pay good money for good food, but it is completely another to pay good money for lousy food. One restaurant I would recommend without a doubt is the Golden Dragon. This is Chinese cuisine at it's best. Plus the restaurant overlooks the ocean and is stunning at sunset. Very romantic and the food is outstanding. And although pricey at $100 for dinner for two, at least I felt it was money well spent. The grounds of the hotel are immense. They are well-kept  truly beautiful with the many ponds, waterfalls, flowers and wildlife. Bottom line is this: HHV is a nice place to stay. However, either bite the bullet and go for a full ocean view or stick with a garden view. Eat some of your meals off property. Or do what I will do in the future and go to Maui! =)

<Content>Expensive Hotel, Beautiful, Caters mainly to Japanese, small pool The hotel is absolutely beautiful! Clean and friendly yet you pay for it! A sandwich is 10 bucks. Small pools (2) for the amount of people who stay here! The beach is also extrememly small in front of this hotel. Nice but expensive shops in the hotel. Caters mainly to Japanese tourists. If you want to spend all your money on a hotel and get a clean, nice hotel this is the place, BUT this is not a very good deal. Restaurants are a rip off. Stay somewhere else unless you have all the money in the world and dont mind paying top dollar for a plain old burger or sandwich!:)

<Content>Great hotel, but overpriced We stayed in the Ali'i tower - definately a good move. Free coffee  water, excellent maid service and good views of the beach. Enormous hotel, so very busy and impersonal. A long walk to the centre of Waikiki though, but a 10 min walk to the Ala Moana shopping centre.Food and drink in the hotel are totally overpriced - a complete rip-off, and service in the restaurants and bars was terrible. Waiting 30 mins for a cold deli sandwich that cost $11! Continetal breakfast $14!Recommend the Wailana Coffee House over the road from the hotel to eat breakfast instead - loads of food and speedy service for 5$. Also for cheap beer and pupu go the the Tiki Bar at the top floor of the Ala Moana shopping centre. Live music, cheap pitchers and happy hour every afternoon

<Content>Wonderful Tropical Resort We recently returned from 8 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We thought this was a wonderful resort and after reading some of the reviews, I wonder if we were staying at the same place. The Hilton has a beautiful beach  lovely tropical grounds with fountains, waterfalls, penquins, flamingos,  tiki torches (the penquins were a special treat). It is a very large busy resort,but because of its size it never felt crowded. We enjoyed walking around the resort and didn't think there were alot of children, but perhaps it was the time of year (October). There were a few minor inconveniences, but what vacation doesn't have those. Staff was friendly, doorman  conciege at our tower were helpful. Had a partial oceanview room at the Ali'i Tower  room was very spacious. A comfortable king bed, large bathroom, nice lanai, refrigerator, free coffee  bottled water. Maid service 3 times a day with turn down service  chocolates. There is also a private pool, gym,  free appetizers in the evening. Only dissappointment was we asked for a upgrade  were told that the tower was full.(She didn't check so I'm not sure if that was the case, but we didn't push the issue) We were on the 11th floor and had a lovely view of the super pool and grounds, but only oceanview from one end of the lanai (I guess thats why its called partial). Also, they told us the contintenal breakfast was offered in our tower for a nominal charge which turned out to be $14.00! There is a large variety of shops, from ABC store to designer stores. Prices were good at the General Store  the Sundry Shop  had just about anything we needed. Pools were very nice, like other reviews have mentioned, Super Pool gets very crowded. Either get there before 9 to reserve your chair or wait until the afternoon, when we didn't have a problem. (It was good to see that the pool employees remove towels if it seems like hours since anyone had sat there) Also, we found the Tapa Pool quieter. We ate at the hotel a couple of times: skip the dinner buffet at the Rainbow (buffet at Oceananium was much better for the same price) but the steaks were wonderful at the Village  worth the money; breakfast was okay at the Deli or Tropics, but better at the Outrigger Reef where you get a full buffet for $10 or across the street at the Coffee Shop for $5-$10. Beach was lovely  water was beautiful, we only rented the lounges one day, but another day I rented a beach chair for $10.00 which I thought was a good deal. Here are a few other tips: Pick up the Hilton Coupon Book-I saved $$ at their shops  restaurants,(also all the other Waikiki coupon books available can save you money); 10 min. walk along the beach brings you down to other hotels in Waikiki; insist on a bellboy for your luggage, we carried our own luggage as did most other guests we observed; check out the evening poolside entertainment  fireworks; self-parking was convenient  cheaper than valet. After visiting crowded downtown Wakiki I'm glad we stayed at the Hilton. We liked the fact that the Hilton is a little out of way. Maybe you're not in the middle of the action, but it was definately quieter  nicer at the Hilton-exactly what we were looking for. We rented a car  didn't find a problem parking anywhere but if you don't,there are buses, trolleys or taxis to take you everywhere. Unfortunately our vacation had to end but hopefully we will be able to return to the Hilton again in the future. This was definately a resort and a vacation at the top of our list!! (P.S.: We loved Oahu)

<Content>Bad Idea, Waste Of Money And Boring! We spent one week at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki and aside from the fact that we got upgraded to an ocean view (which was beautiful), the resort was pretty much a rip off. We had spent the weekend at the W hotel before coming to the Hilton (comparable room rates)- we should have stayed at the W! There is no music or stereo in the room number one. When my friend had a sore throat, they charged us 5$ for salt to be delivered to our room (for her to gargle with). When I got sea urchin stuck in my foot from surfing, they charged us another 5$ for vinegar. At the W, everything was complimentary, including breakfast, and the front desk staff carried our floaties, chairs, and towels (compliments of the hotel) out to the beach for us. The food in the Village is terrible, very unathentic, and very expensive. The best place was the sushi restaurant but still SUPER pricey. The best deal is to get out of the resort and get some sushi for half the price elsewhere. The noodle shop consisted of oily, tasteless noodles, Top Ramen would have been better. The pool is WAY overcrowded (and we were there during the off-season), and VERY boring, mostly kids and families running around- which we weren't expecting, thinking kids would be in school by mid september. There was a point where the pool had to be evacuated because a kid pooped or threw up in it or both. The beach is slightly better but not by much: the snorkeling is TERRIBLE compared to the rest of the island- very sandy and cloudy due to the Atlantis Boat coming in and out right there. LOTS of kids running around or people talking very loudly on their cell phones. The rentals are a total rip off. Don't rent any of the flotation devices from the beach guy (even though he's a SUPER nice hawaiian dude), just buy something from the ABC store or any other store! They charge you $50 for a chair and umbrella! This is a perfect place for a family that doesn't want to venture out or deal with real Hawaii. You might as well be at a resort in Florida or any other place with an ocean. EVEN the fireworks were cancelled the week we were there! I lost my beach bag and when I went to the front desk to talk to lost and found they just made me call a voicemail and leave a message with my description of my belongings. The staff was VERY unhelpful, even rude at one point. When I finally did find my bag (by a fluke, a guy who worked at the pool overheard our conversation) my snorkel, mask, book, and sarong were all missing. This is NOT recommended for people who do not want to waste money or who have traveled all the way to Hawaii to really experience Hawaii. I can't even imagine being there for a honeymoon, it is NOT a romantic place at all. It is one huge unpersonal resort full of tourists and money traps. This is a place for SUCKERS! That's how I felt every hour I was there. Fortunately my friend and I met some locals and spent half the week up at the North Shore, the BEST part of the vacation for sure!

<Content>Crowded, Not-so-special I agree with the reviewers who found this hotel crowded and not-so-special. The property reminds me of a cross between a Bronx, NY high-rise and Disney Village. Lots of little tourist-trap shops, not a lot of scenery. The beach is rocky sand next to a parking lot. Overall, it's a very average hotel in a run-down section of town. Stayed in the Tapa Tower, which is probably the lowest-ticket building onsite. Room was clean but nothing special. Missing hand lotion, paper next to the telephones and any sort of TV Guide. My room overlooked the city and a torn-down apartment building. Concierges were hit-or-miss. One recommended a GREAT sushi place; another recommended a place to get my watch fixed that doesn't actually fix watches. On the plus side: The bed and pillows were some of the best I've ever slept on. Room service was decent and very friendly. Security was very responsive to the noisy teenagers next door. The best time to experience the resort is at 5AM, when it is empty and quiet.This would probably be a great place for families and kids -- and there were many of them here. Not so great for business travellers, although it's only a 10-minute walk to the Convention Center.

<Content>Don鈥檛 listen to the whiners! The Hilton is a great place to stay; we just got back from a one week stay at the Hilton. After reading some of the reviews I was a bit worried about my trip as I had already booked it. However it was a fabulous place and everything was perfect. My wife and I travel every year for a vacation and the past few years has been Mexico and Cuba and we always stay in a 5 Star and the Hilton was one of the nicest places so far. I don鈥檛 know what people are complaining about, yes it is busy and maybe a bit crowded however you ARE on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu. It is a known fact that Waikiki is a very busy place and Honolulu is a City! If you want quiet place maybe choose another island. We stayed in the Kalia Tower which I found to be very nice it is the newest tower in the village and even the furniture seemed nicer than in the rooms of the Ali which is strange since the Ali tower is supposed to be the nicer. The Kalia Tower has its own Pool and Hot tub for the towers guests which was nice as it was never crowded. The beach is nice as you are at one end of Waikiki so there is plenty of space not like further down the strip.One warning! Stay away from Maui Divers! It is a jewelry store that has many smaller stores and kiosks all over the island. They have a scam going, what they do is advertise opening up an oyster and seeing if there is a pearl inside, it is $14 and you don鈥檛 pay if there is no pearl. Well every oyster has a pearl most are black. Anyway we fell for it, and we got a black one, the lady will ahh and ohh at you telling you how big and beautiful it is. Then she takes it and drills a hole in it without asking you and then tries to sell you a ring or pendant to put it in. They Are $150 to $350 for this. Of course you think you have scored big with the black pearl so you end up doing it like we did. After that I noticed everyone was getting black pearls and one lady had 2 in one oyster鈥?she was sold a pair of earrings! Anyway beware! It鈥檚 not a $14 pearl it is at least a $150 pearl.

<Content>Grounds are beautiful, hotel is crowded We stayed here for 4 nights in October, 2005 while on a combined pleasure/business trip. Since our time here was during the business portion of our trip, we did not use the pool or beach at all. While the Super Pool may be the biggest in Waikiki, it was fairly unimpressive. The grounds of the hotel are gorgeous, many tropical plants, flamingoes, a black swan, turtles, penguins, parrots and macaws. All the employees were extremely nice, courteous, friendly and helpful. We stayed in the Ali'i tower since we had read on tripadvisor that is was more upscale. The room was average size, kept clean, but nothing extra special. The carpet was stained in several places, the wallpaper was peeling at the seams in several places. We never got a chance to sample the free appetizers in the afternoon. We did appreciate the free coffee and water every day. We only ate in the hotel once -- hamburgers at the Tropics Cafe, which were very good. As others have recommended, eat breakfast across the street at the Wailana Coffee House -- it is VERY good and cheap -- 2 eggs, 2 strips of bacon and all the delicious pancakes you can eat for $4.95. The dinner at the Kobe Steak House which is not in the Hilton complex, but just outside of it, was also delicious. We enjoyed walking through all the shops -- expensive, but so is everything in Hawaii! We were there in the off-season and it was still fairly crowded -- can't imagine what it would be like during peak season! Waikiki (and Honolulu in general) are extremely crowded and congested. Like any other big city with more palm trees! The Hilton is on the outskirts of Waikiki, which was a BIG plus -- you didn't have to deal with all the crowds unless you wanted to. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, but don't expect 5 star rooms since they are in the process of a much needed renovation.

<Content>Five nights was not enough! We arrived here after a fantastic 10 day trip staying with relatives in Northern California, feeling as we were so close to Hawaii, we should pop over for a few days.We loved this hotel, we loved Oahu and we loved the people. It always amazes me when I read reviews about hotels we been to (and we travelled to Africa, USA, Asia and around Europe) that other people's experience seem so different to ours. We arrived mid-afternoon, mid August, mid rush and had to wait a few minutes to check in. We are patient people, and were told, by a really nice guy on the desk that because our rooms were not next to each other as originally booked (but on the same floor in the Tapa Tower - at least 30 seconds walk away!) that we would be credited $200 for the inconvenience and for waiting so patiently.The hotel was packed, but we were always able to get a table in the restaurants we wanted, were delighted by the courteous staff, and loved walking on the beach at 6.30 in the morning before things got too busy.So things weren't cheap. When you've travelled halfway around the world to a paradise island, you shouldn't expect to pay the same prices as round the corner. I always expect to pay more on holiday than I would do at home - that's part of the deal!Please don't be put off by other people's reviews. In my experience, if you are polite and courteous, you find other people to be too. We loved it.

<Content>Tourist Trap Plan on walking, If you need something its a hike, Had to return food twice for terrible quality meats. A filet I could not cut through and a pastrami sandwich with actual slices of fat. The food is horrible. The staff is only nice when they are selling your stuff. Will never go back to this hotel. Pool is open from 8-5. I had a deluxe ocean view Rainbow room with the smallest bathroom I have ever seen. Also way overpriced bad food.Stay in Ko Olina Marriot and drive and visit waikiki!Find somewhere else to stay.

<Content>1st class resort We stayed a week at the Hilton and here is our review. First the size of the place is amazing - its very clean and well kept resort. They must have hundreds of staff working very hard to maintain it and it shows. Location in our eyes is the best on Waikiki beach - the beach is also kept very clean. Amenities on site are amazing with such a huge choice for dining or shopping.Food at all the restaurants was very good - apart from the Rainbow buffet which was average. Bali by the sea was 1st class along with the Village steak and seafood restaurant. We ordered room-service on our last night and were expecting it to turn up cold -but it was piping hot - a real plus for such a big and busy resort. Rooms were very spacious ( as i said we stayed a week left for Maui - and returned the night before our homebound flight ) we stayed in the Rainbow tower garden view - but it was facing the lagoon which was nice at night with the sunset and the outdoor music on the green. On our last night we stayed in an ocean view room in Rainbow and the views looking down beach and diamond head was amazing. If anyone has any questions feel free to contact me.jj...

<Content>Only Place I'd Stay on Waikiki We stayed at the Ali'i Tower from Oct 15 - 21st and just loved it. The Ali'i Tower offers extra amenities, such as maid service 3x daily, free bottled water and the use of the Oceanside Terrace (which includes exclusive use of the Ali'i Pool, Fitness Center,  complimentary appetizers at sunset.) The Ali'i pool was never crowded and had the BEST views of Waikiki. After looking at the other resorts and hotels on Waikiki I felt the HHV was truly the best one there. It's also located on the best part of Waikiki Beach and next door to Fort DeRussey Park. Fort DeRussey Park is a great place to have a picnic while enjoying the magnificent views of the ocean. Yes, HHV does nickel and dime you, but you can find good meal deals close by. Try The Shorebird (down the beach @ the Outrigger Reef). They have a great breakfast buffet for 9.95 w/ coupon (10.95 w/o coupon) compared to the HHV's mediocre buffet at the Rainbow Lanai for 20.00. Be advised: there is construction on site in between the Tapa  Diamond Head Towers. The projected completion date is Christmas '05. This does cause noise during the day (including weekends). If your plans include a stay at the Tapa or Diamond Head Tower before or around Dec. 05 I would recommend changing to one of the other towers, as the noise can be problematic. I could hear the noise from the Ali'i Tower, but thankfully I could escape to the Ali'i Oceanside Terrace.

<Content>Can't Wait to Return! Having read some of this hotel's mixed reviews on this website, my husband and I were prepared for a bit of a disappointment, but our experience couldn't have been better. We were in Tapa Tower with a partial ocean view. Having visited a guest room with a full ocean view, we truly appreciated a view of the amazing cityscape from our balcony at night. Our room was large with a lovely king sized bed, flat screen TV, sofa and a great dressing/bar area with a refrigerator and coffee pot. I am a clean freak when it comes to bathrooms, and found ours to be fresh and pristine. On our first morning, we bought two cups of coffee and two danishes at the Tapa Bar which came to $16. After that, we bought a large package of kona coffee and muffins or croissants at the ABC Store made our own breakfast in our room. Also, since Oahu's water is so pure we refilled our water bottles from the tap and stored them in our refrigerator instead of buying water. We bought liquor and mix at the ABC Store as well, and enjoyed relaxing cocktails in our room before dinner a few nights. We also discovered the Wailana Cafe and Cocktail Bar located across Ala Moana Boulevard from the resort, and ate many breakfasts and lunches there. Nothing fancy, but it's clean, the staff is very friendly, the food is good and prices are much the same as the mainland. They also offered half price cocktails from 3-5PM, which was a great place to visit with newfound friends at the end of sightseeing excursions. The bus/limo bay is located at the back of the hotel, and they post daily schedules there for the free trolleys to places like Hilo Hattie and DFS Stores. Our hotel seemed to be a tour bus hub for the other hotels nearby. Our entire trip was booked through Aloha VIP Tours, and included all our transfers to and from the airport. Both times, we were driven by a delightful man named Ernesto who was our first clue as to how friendly and warm everyone on the island would be. Aloha had a Maui Divers van pick us up for a breakfast our first morning on the island, and it was here that we were given an entertaining little show and a chance to sign up for all the tours they offer. After the breakfast, we were herded onto a bus and taken to Maui Divers factory. Once inside, we were given a quick tour of how their jewelry is made and then left to maneuver through showroom after showroom of jewelry. Some of the clerks were quite assertive, so we found our way to the street where a very nice lady summoned the Maui Divers van to return us to our hotel instead of going on the Hilo Hattie factory. We took the Circle Island Tour our second day on the island. This was a good move, as we had a wonderful driver and the rest of the week to revisit favorite spots. Because our hotel was the first stop for every tour bus we boarded, we were able to get a front seat which gave us the best view of the entire day's tour. We took the Duck Tour to Pearl Harbor, which was really intersting, but once you arrive at Pearl Harbor you're left to find your own way around. On the return trip, however, the Duck drove right off a beach and sailed us out near Sand Island. Both the trip and the island history we learned made it a great value. We also went to Germaine's Luau one evening (cheesy, but now we can say we went to a luau and tried poi) and took also took a sunset cruise. As it happened, there was a full moon the night of the cruise so we abandoned the floor show and spent our time topside watching the beautiful sunset and the amazing full moon over the city and the oceain. A word about the tours: the luau and sunset cruise tours were also by motorcoach and during these two trips our tour guides led us in song, told jokes and generally tried to create some fun energy on the way to our destination. Maybe we're not good tourists, because this was our least favorite part of the entire trip. Also, at each of these tours our picture was taken and then shown to us when back on the bus. We got fantastic pictures of our own both at the luau and on the cruise, but felt pressured to pay $20 for pictures that we didn't particularly like or want. Maybe other tour companies are different from Aloha VIP in ths regard. We also booked a bike tour and Diamonhead hike through Eco Tours, which was the best money we ever spent. The guides were friendly and we really got better feel for the island. The scenery was truly amazing, and the Diamondhead hike through the plotters caves was almost as interesting as the view from the top was breathtaking. We caught the Atlantis Sub right off HHV's own dock one afternoon, and this was a thrilling excursion for two people who don't snorkle. My husband is a bit claustrophobic, but he had a great time. One afternoon after our bike tour, we treated ourselves to massages at the Mandara Spa which was a great way to relax. We'd read that there are 900,000 people on the island of Oahu and 700,000 registered cars, and that parking can be problematic, so we decided to wait and see if we needed to rent a car. We picked up a bus guide at the bookstore in the resort, packed snacks, sunscreen and water and hopped the bus a couple of days. We found it to be quite adequate for our independent excursions and well populated with other tourists. Not all drivers announce their stops, but they are happy to l on so many occasions and we only brought one pair. While the hotel had it's own TV information channel, I really missed my laptop as it would have been so much easier to access travel updates online and get directions to restaurants, etc. All in all, this trip exceeded our expectations. The weather was great despite a few little rain mists - no humidity with a constant breeze. I was thrilled that there were no lizards, snakes or bugs to be seen either! We crammed a ton of experiences into our seven days, and we can't wait to return to Hilton Hawaiian Village!

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian Village overpriced and over-rated I felt this hotel could have been much more accomodating considering the price we paid - the only thing worth the money was the view from the tower - however, still not worth 400+/night. The food was horribly expensive but we went off the property and found a great diner for breakfast (sorry cannot remember the name of it) - I would not go back to this hotel again - and likely would not return to Waikiki - th eother islands have much more to offer!!

<Content>Indifferent Service, Crowded  Before I begin, I suggest every traveller visiting Oahu to purchase a copy of OAHU REVEALED by Wizard Publications. It was most helpful and honest!After six relaxing, laid-back wonderful nights at the Ko Olina Beach Club from Sept. 26 - Oct. 2, my husband and I ventured off into the concrete jungle of Waikiki and stayed at the epicentre of all the madness - the HHV! What a mistake we had made! It all started when we pulled into the driveway of this chaotic resort. We immediately notified one of the captains and told them we are checking into the Ali'i Tower, asked where we could park the car for 30 minutes since we were returning our vehicle after check in. He was very rude to us, pointed to the general check in desk with a huge line up and said, You can't park your car here! Thanks to Tripadvisor, I knew he was wrong and there was a separate check in counter for the Ali'i guests! He clearly WAS NOT LISTENING! My husband and I never intended nor intimated that we wanted to leave our car parked there. All I asked was where the Ali'i Tower guests can check in and where to park the car. I had to ask him several times, Where should we park the car? and he kept responding with a You can't park here!. I changed my line of questioning to, What do you suggest we do right now? He somehow miraculously understood all of a sudden and told us to park in the parkade. Bad first impression already and thought to myself, What a contrast in atmosphere and service compared to in Ko Olina! I agree strongly with the other reviews that this place is CHAOTIC and OVERCROWDED. I feel sorry for those who use the Super Pool because they need to be there at 8:30AM sharp to get a chair! For those travelling in groups, good luck getting chairs together! For those who want to stay out of the shade and not get a tan, you can go to the Superpool after 4:00PM and get a chair because it's all shaded! Oh, and did I mention that there was so much construction onsite including the 2nd floor of the Ali'i Tower! This caused a lot of problems with the elevator service. This was such an inconvenience because they blocked off the elevator to this floor, so everyone had to get to the 3rd floor via stairwell in order to get back to their suites! The so-called supreme Ali'i tower SERVICE is not poor, but INDIFFERENT! I had to initiate a smile and say hello most of the time and I felt it was very difficult and forced for the front desk clerks/doormen to reciprocate. Make sure you take advantage of the CONCIERGE service - i.e. booking dinner reservations. As for the Ali'i Pool, it was small (4 ft. deep all the way) and dirty (winds caused dead bees, flies and leaves to float), but plenty of chairs, less crowded and peaceful, overlooking the beach. There were hardly any children and most of the guests were 40+, retired couples relaxing and reading a book. They have an ice water dispenser at the Ocean Terrace for complimentary use. For those who like to workout, wear your gym gear down to the pool along with bathing suit, work out and then take a dip in the pool. It's nice because there's an open gym exclusive for Ali'i guests at no extra charge! If planning to lie at the pool all day, please note that Ocean Terrace only serves a light lunch and is closed between 10AM-11:00AM and last call is 7:00PM. Please take advantage of the complimentary hors d'oevres between 5PM - 7PM - chicken skewers, deep fried shiu mai (pork dumplings), cheese platter, vegetable platter w/dip. As for the ROOMS, they were comfortable but nothing extravagant. Our bathroom had a shower/bathtub and a separate vanity area with color TV. We also had a 32 plasma TV, fax machine, fridge, mini bar, down-quilted duvet/pillows and an in-room safe (which costs a whopping $3.50 per day!) There are 3 maid services a day, apparently, since we only got two - didn't know about the ice service until after reading about it!) However, I wasn't pleased on the 2nd last day when I didn't have small bills to tip the maid and that same evening noticed the linens were changed to dirty ones! It smelled so bad and the garlic smell was so pungent! I was told they were to use existing linens througout our stay, but for some reason, the maid decided to change it! I knew this because our original duvet cover had an atypical black stitching across the top.FOOD in the resort - not worth it! Even the Round Table Pizza joint - they charge $10 for a personal sized pizza! For breakfast, Wailana Coffee House is a good bang for your buck, but it's your typical greasy diner type food. As for a quick lunch/dinner deal and great taste, go to Fatty's Chinese Kitchen. Cut through International Marketplace (follow the yellow line) towards Kuhio. It's next door to Miramar Hotel. Order the Beef Chow Fun with Choy Sum. It's delicious and as the Chinese would say, it has excellent 'Wok Hay'. If you have a car, you should go to Ruth Chris Steakhouse and order the barbecued shrimp, crab cakes, cowboy cut rib-eye steak and creme brulee/apple caramel pie a la mode! The service was outstanding. Ask to be seated in Pat's section, you'll be treated like royalty!! Oh and by the way, people here like to eat LATE! Make sure you make reservations a couple of days in advance, especially if you're planning to dine at Duke's. As for the Ocean House Restaurant at the Outrigger Reef, it's nothing to write home about. I've read so many great reviews about this place, but it's just average. The only dish that was decent was the coconut lobster skewers (appetizer). Don't order the prime rib here, it's dry, has no flavor and served with boring, tasteless mashed potatoes and creamy horseradish out of a jar. If you want top notched seafood cuisine, take a cab and go to Roy's. It's the best for seafood! Order the misoyaki butterfish - melts in your mouth!In a nutshell, the HHV's Ali'i Tower is overrated! If returning to Waikiki, we would definitely not pay $350USD a night to stay here again! I've stayed at the Outrigger Waikiki, Sheraton Moana Surfrider and during my college days, the Ohana West and must say that they are more worth the money than the HHV. For what you're getting, it's not worth it, especially comparing it to a resort such as the Marriott Ko Olina Beach Club.

<Content>good if you have kids, eat off campus pros: hotel right on beach! this is not so common on Waikiki Waikiki beach is at its widest here and it gets very narrow further downcons: they keep trying to sell you time shares and get you to go listen to their sales talk, food overpriced, not as many stores in village as you'd think---you can't make it your whole holiday  While we also found the hotel food overpriced, we realized we could just walk off of the property and eat anywhere else cheaper. There was even a Mc Donalds and Subway down the street and a huge mall Ala Moana Shopping Mall a 10 minute walk away with a food court, nice restaurants and every shop you could think of. For breakfast we took the advise of others and ate at the coffee shop across the street which also offered fresh fruit and muesli (very good) as well as diner breakfasts. The ABC store on property sold prepackaged sushi, sanwiches and fruit and snacks at reasonable prices--the pineapple is a bargain and a cup of to go coffee only .69 cents The hotel is very convenient--down the elevator you're at the pool, a few steps more the beach. We could run up easily for diaper changes, get things forgotten etc....there is a clean bathroom, changing cabin and showers downstairs too. A few times it would begin to rain and we could run for cover until it stopped. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower which was just fine--no fancy view but we didn't pay for it either. The room had 2 double beds and still had room for a crib (I believe it was provided for free) double stroller all of our suitcases and we still could move around. The room had a small refrigerator and coffee maker so we got some food for the kids and sometimes just ate on the balcony. If we had to schlepp all of our stuff and the kids a few blocks and across a busy street to get to the beach it wouldn't have been so nice or convenient. Also the other parts of Waikiki are right next to aloud busy street---look at a map. Its true they should provide more chairs at the pool but since we got up early we always got some. I believe the beach umbrellas/chairs are rented through a third party--the Hilton provided free towel service. People brought their own food/beverages to pool side from ABC stores to avoid pricey snacks pool side It would have been nice if the hotel provided more activities--a Lua for example. We noticed from our balcony every night shows for groups that rented out the space on the lawn but nothing for hotel guests. I would recommend bringing your guide book too because they can't really help you with anything on the outside world--you are told to talk to the activities counter which tries to sell you a big package tour. To remedy this, we rented a car (Hertz has a booth on property) $9 extra if you want a car seat and you can pick the car up on the Hilton property and did our own exploring---Pearl Harbor for example is free admission.  Also at the mall a there is a grocery store and Longs drugs for diapers baby food etc...they were only a little bit more expensive then what we paid back home in a major city I think that if you remind yourself that this is not an all inclusive Caribbean resort you'll do ok. Staff is friendly enough but not outgoing. A little tipping goes a long way. Also if you compare it to the other hotels in the area, it really is a dream.

<Content>Wonderful! Wonderful!....Did I mention it was wonderful? First some background...we are an ordinary working family that loves to vacation but need to get the most bang for the buck, so to speak. This hotel is fantastic. I do not understand why or how or what people could complain about. We stayed in The Rainbow Tower. Our room was nice size and very clean. The beach area in front of the hotel was spotless and deep enough to accomodate not only the cabanas but also all the people who chose to lay on towels. This is not the case down the beach, in front of other hotels. Trust me we walked ALL the way down to see for ourselves. The lobby was open and the common areas had AMPLE seating while you waited for cars, family etc. The pool area clean and the water crisp and sparkling, no cloudy, clorine haze. We chose not to eat at the hotel. Resort food is overpriced the world over----this is a no brainer for us-----we use that kind of money for side trips and sourvenirs.  Just a block away was a local coffee shop that served b-fast, lunch, dinner; much like a Denny's or Bob Evans in selection and price. There is an ABC store on the property and a fridge in the room-we put two and two together and saved on food. A caveat, some of the money we saved on food we chose to utilize for valet parking, our version of splurging. IF you can find good deals on prices stay here. We have been back and forth to Hawaii 3 times and this was money well spent. In fact the vote was from now on stay here or stay no-where. Feel free to email with any questions, our motto is vacation information is money saving power. Aloha.

<Content>A bit too busy I stayed here for 4 days the last week of Sept- 1/2 for business and 1/2 for pleasure. This place is HUGE... it's like a town within a town. It was very busy- the lobby itself was like being in a mall. When we got to the resort, I felt really overwhelmed. The lobby was so busy and there was a huge line to check in. Luckily and easily enough, there was a self check in kiosk that worked well- though a bit impersonal. We stayed at the Aliaia towers. Truthfully, for the description and the amount I paid, I would have expected something a bit nicer. Not that is was not nice, just very average and basic. The ocean view room we booked smelled very musty, and the airconditioner was very, very, very loud. We asked for another room and they accomodated us, though they only had a partial ocean view room. I did not really think it was much of a difference...The room , again, was very ordinary for the price. It was clean and it smelled fine. It had a nice balacony, though was a bit cramped. I found the staff friendly, but not overly speedy. It took the porter 1.5 hours to get our luggage (2 small pieces) to us- making us later for an apt. we had. The resort was so big that personal attention to things just seemed to be lacking. All the shops were nice, the beach was pretty, and the pool looked well maintained. We only had breakfast at the resort. The buffet at the Rainbow Laine was very good, nice vareity, if not expensive- 20.00 per person, though I have paid this at nice resorts before so I was not too surprised.. however, some of the restaurants charged 12-14.oo for a continental and I found that a bit too much- the buffet was very much worth it. I found that most, if not all, restaurants closed at 9 or 9:30- which left late diners very little choice but to order room service. Finding something to eat after a long day was a bit annoying. We liked the Oceantside terrace, but their last call was at 7pm. We were told that the resort held firworks every Friday night, they did not when we were there but no one (staff) seemed to know why. They no longer rent snorkel gear- was kind of a disappointment. We had a fax in our room, which was nice for business purposes, but an incoming fax cost 27.00 for 5 pages.... a bit much I thought. I have paid less at much nicer resorts. This wasn't a bad resort, it just was a bit too busy and lound for what I am used to. Hope this helps!

<Content>Very busy! I was disappointed with this hotel. We stayed at the Tapa Tower. Hotel was very busy with conference guests and somedays it was impossible to get a seat by the bar for people sitting working on their laptops. The main pool was very busy everyday, mainly with people leaving towels on the beds and then disappearing. We found it impossible to get a bed by the pool for the entire week. The Tapa pool by our tower was right next door to where they are building the wedding chapel and they were refurbishing rooms in the opposite block so it was very noisy! We ventured out onto the beach one day but at a cost of $51 for 2 beds and an umbrella we didn't bother again.Hotel had nice grounds and plenty of shops  resturants but certainly didn't live up to my expectations of a nice relaxing break at at quality hotel. I would look to stay somewhere else if I returned to Hawaii.

<Content>Kalia Tower was great I used Trip Advisor to plan our once in a lifetime family trip - I love the advice from other travelers and find it to be right on. We stayed 2 nights in the Kalia tower before leaving for Maui and the Hyatt. The Kalia Tower was wonderful. We paid for ocean view rooms even though we are Honors members - everyone on the site says you get upgraded but I didn't want to take a chance on this special trip. The rooms were lovely, service great. We loved the Executive level - the view from the breakfast room was spectacular and we could have spent hours there just looking out at the ocean. Of course everthing's expensive in Hawaii - we knew that before the trip and planned accordingly. Waikiki is wild and the Hilton is a nice calm oasis in the middle of it. The only problem is that it's crowded - the number of people everywhere is a little overwhelming. We didn't go to the superpool until mid afternoon and never had a problem getting chairs. The beach was nice, but it was very hot and I'm too cheap to pay the price for the chairs and umbrella! We had a nice dinner at the Golden Dragon, and one off site at an Italian restaurant with a great view - can't remember the name. My only complaint is the Kalia pool. It is ridiculously small - just kind of funny that this beautiful hotel and beautiful tower would advertise this as a private pool - way below expectations. Our flight was late afternoon, and after checkout. But the hotel lets you use a lovely room - free - to shower and change in after spending the afternoon at the beach and pool after checking out - awfully nice. I think if I stayed here again I would stay in the Alii Tower. My sister has stayed there and it sounds perfect. (Maui Hyatt was fantastic)

<Content>Great experience I recently got married (August 27, 2005) and I chose to stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for my wedding night. We live on O'ahu, so we've stayed at many different hotels before, but I thought that we would stay at one of the more high end onesfor our special night. Overall, we had a great experience, no problems. We stayed in the Ali'i tower, which was beautiful and all that I had expected. It was pretty pricey, even for a Kamaaina rate(local resident rate), but it was well worth it! I would definitely recommend this hotel to any honeymooners or couples celebrating their anniversaries. As for the busy and crowded reviews that people have been grumbling about, that is so minor! Living in Hawaii, you know that Waikiki is always busy, so if you can't deal with the crowds, my advice is don't stay in Waikiki!

<Content>LOVED OUR STAY AT THE HILTON HAWAIIAN VILLAGE! My husband and I just returned from 12 days at the HHV (9/4 through 9/16). We absolutely loved staying there. We had a corner room in the Tapa Tower that was very large with a desk, dresser, table and chairs, chair and ottoman. Plus the bath area had a wet bar, double closet, and another dresser and a full size tub/shower. There was a great view of the ocean from the lanai. There was a tiny little AC leak when we first got there but I called that evening and scheduled an appointment for 10 a.m. and it was fixed as promised. I highly recommend becoming a Hilton Honors member. My husband has a Gold Membership and a very nice continental breakfast was included every day, along with the USA Today paper. Also checking in is a breeze. From the time we left the airport until we got our luggage delivered to our room, it was approximately one hour. We did not use the super pool but did use the Tapa Pool everyday. There was never any problem getting a lounge chair. The bar by the Tapa Pool has great local entertainment. The internet and in-room movie system was great, too - tons of movies to choose from. We knew ahead of time that they did charge for coffee, but took our own small container of coffee and creamer - no problem. Also, the ABC store on the property has all sorts of drinks, bottled water, yogurt, snacks, etc. We walked down Kalia which turns into Ena Road (on the other side of Ala Moana) and about 1 block down is a laundry facility that does bundle laundry. Just drop it off and pick it up later. It is a large property, but we never felt crowded or congested. When we stay in Waikiki again, the HHV will be at the top of my list of hotels to stay at.

<Content>We enjoyed it We stayed at HHV from September 7-14. We were using a Hilton HHonors certificate for 6 of the nights, so only had to pay for one.We rented a car at the airport (Alamo, no problems) and arrived around 7 pm. No wait to check in. With the certificate you generally are assigned Tapa or Diamond Head Tower. We asked if it was possible to be switched to Ali'i or Rainbow (we are Honors Silver, and it makes a difference for this type of thing). They said that Hilton has decreed no Ali'i Tower for certificates, but we were put in an oceanview room in Rainbow Tower. Location was okay, not great. I went back to the front desk the next day and managed to get our room upgraded to a corner room on the 20th floor of the Rainbow Tower -- now that was a view to die for!! We were very pleased with the room, as it had two walls of glass/two balconies. We could see Diamond Head from our bed, and watched the Friday night show/fireworks while enjoying a pizza from Round Table (pretty good) and a nice bottle of wine on our balcony.Elevators are a problem in Rainbow Tower, but the view and the proximity to the beach and pool make it worthwhile.We did participate in the time share presentation for the $100 Hilton dollars. It took just over 2 hours and we did not buy. Not sure it was worth it, though when we used the $$ it was nice to enjoy the things for free.We ate at Goldon Dragon, which we thought was quite good. (Good Entertainment Book coupon, plus you can use the Hilton $$ on top of the coupon.) Also ate at Rainbow Lanai for breakfast once (okay, not sure it was worth the cost) and had pizza from Round Table as mentioned above. We hit the grocery store and the Kmart soon after arriving, so bought snacks, sodas, wine, umbrella and floats to use for the week.Other people have mentioned the charge for coffee. We had a sign next to the coffee maker that said you got one pot for free each day. I did have coffee each morning and was not charged for it, so I think this must be the case.The pool was pretty full, though we didn't have too hard a time finding chairs in the afternoon. If you ask the attendants they will remove towels and other items from chairs if it is obvious that they are being reserved for people that are not there.HHV has some of the nicest beach in Waikiki. Still, we spent more of our time on the North Shore beaches (Waimea for enjoying the sun and water and Sunset Beach for watching the surfers). A car is a must. Parking at the hotel was never a problem.We found the staff (especially the housekeeping staff) to be friendly and happy to help. Check out was no problem, though you should check the bill carefully. We were overcharged for parking, but it was promptly removed when I brought it to their attention. Since we had a late flight we took advantage of the hostpitality suite (need to sign up the day before) to shower and get cleaned up before heading out to the airport.From our balcony we could see the Ali'i Tower pool and hot tub, and they looked nice. Plus, the pool is open into the evening, while the Superpool closes at 6.We used the business center as we needed to get on the Internet for a few minutes. They had 3 computers available, and the charge for 15 minutes was about $5. Cheaper than using the in-room option. Also, if you go to the business center between midnight and 6 am, it would have been only $3 for the 15 minutes. There is a printer available as well.Overall -- we had a great time, and would consider staying at the HHV again.

<Content>Too busy We stayed at this resort from 31 August until 5 Sep. We arrived from New Zealand at 11pm. I had specifically booked the Kalia Tower as all the research I had done suggested this was the newest one. There was some mix up - they told us our booking had been cancelled - the tower was full and they didn't think they could accommodate us!! At 11pm at night after a nine hour flight this didn't go down too well. We booked through a travel agent and had a voucher which was the only reason they found us a room for the night. The next day they ended up transferring us to the Tapa tower as the Kalia tower was fully booked (all my research proving fruitless as we didn't end up where we wanted to). This wasted 1/2 day the next day while they sorted it out. The village is lovely but very very busy. Also my husband was swimming one day at the beach and got talking to a guy who asked him if he was attending the conference there. He said no and asked what the conference was - apparently it was for reformed alcoholics and others with a dubious criminal background!! We also got charged $50 for hiring an umbrella and two loungers for 1/2 day while some reformed criminals next to us got away with paying nothing (in fact two of them weren't even staying at the hotel!) Since returning home have noticed an extra $12 charge for something on my credit card. Would not stay here again.

<Content>Not worth price We spent one night in the Ali'i tower in September 05. We had to call the front desk for services that were supposed to be automatically provided (fresh fruit, water, and turndown service). The room was nice and had a very good view from the balcony; but was not extravagent for the VIP tower. There was nothing horribly wrong with this resort; but nothing stood out either. That is a problem for an expensive, top of the lne resort. We would not return or recommend this to any friend or family member.

<Content>rainbow tower We loved this place but the will nickle and dime you to death. The view we had was great. the room was great and it had a mini fridge in the room. Make sure you bring your own coffee or every time you make coffe its $4.00 We did order some sodas at the bar by the pool for $8.25 I was shocked and the pool closes at 6 pm and you do have to pay for the chairs on the beach parking is $15 a day which is not too bad they do have some nice stores in the village and a shipping store on the complex. the only other complaint I do have is its just soo big its alot of people there but do stay anywhere else in Honolulu just bring your wallet for here.

<Content>Not worth the stay We relocated to Oahu from the mainland in April 2005. We stayed at the hotel until our house closed on July 23, 2005 - oh we paid for 2 rooms that entire time SO THINK OF THE MONEY WE WERE DROPPING INCLUDING FOOD 3 MEALS A DAY TIMES 3 PEOPLE. WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. We never got maid service daily if we were lucky everyother day. I was walking to our building one day when the gentlemen who opens the door stood next to the door and jokingly i asked if he was going to open the door, he stated NO YOU ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A BED Our facet in our bathroom leaked nonstop we called the front desk 4 times. Finally a manager called me on my cell phone to state he was personally in your room to fix the problem...I went up there to our room within 2 minutes and guess what - no one was there. I called him back and he stated he was there and it was fixed. It was not. he lied. When we went to the restaurants on the property and they asked what room we are staying at, if we told them the room number, they would put us on a wait list and then seat us in the worse location of the resort. After awhile - we wised up and gave them FAKE names and stated we were not staying at the hotel - WORLD CLASS SERVICE! We took these issues and many more to the GM, Asst GM and ANY MANAGER THAT WOULD LISTEN. The problems and lack of service fell on deaf ears. We paid over $20,000 to stay there for that time period and we got nothing but lack of concern. Our daughters rooms air conditioner was broken the entire time, we asked for it to be fixed....NOTHING. We could not change hotels because of the length of time we required no one else could take us for that long. Finally my sps wrote a letter to the Beverly HIlls Corp Office.... They forwarded the complaint onto the SAME GM as before. The GM called my sps assured him that this was not usual service (we disagree because get this) The GM personally stated he would give us a weekend free at the hotel. (ok fine) and he personally stated he would get us out all the paper work immediately - THAT WAS 3 WEEKS AGO. HE HAS NEVER RETURNED OUR PH CALLS OR HAVE WE RECIEVED THE FREE WEEKEND!THE LIST OF COMPLAINTS GO ON AND ON. I AM JUST TRYING TO LIST THE ONES THAT STAND OUT IN MY MIND. I TRIED TO CUT AND PASTE THE letter my sps wrote to beverly hills and It would not cooperate.

<Content>ok - overrated for the service provided We stayed at HHV from 8/30 - 9/7/05. We didn't like it much and would not come back again for a variety of reasons:1. When we booked the Ocean View room, we were told that we'd get a tower closer to the beach. On the day of arrival, we were told they were all booked and we ended up in Kalia tower, which is the furthest from the beach. Ocean View here is a joke because you are too far from the ocean, and behind other towers (Rainbow, Tapa, and Ali).2. After a long line to check in, and got to our room (which took us almost an hour), we didn't get our luggages delivered. We had to call the front desk to track them down before they start looking into it. Couple hours later, we finally got them. This whole process wasted ~ 3 hours.3. We want to use the fitness center, they said it cost $12/day to use it. Shouldn't the facility be available to all guests and included in the room price?4. Same as other people's comments, the superpool is large, but no pool chairs available if you show up after 9am. Standing in line before the pool open is not our idea of spending time at a resort vacation! Beach chair is ~$12/day, umbrella is $25/day.We ate at Sergio, Village Steak  Seafood, Benihana, and other smaller facilities in the resort. We think the quality  service is ok but not that great. In general, it's bit overrated.

<Content>Best Overall Honolulu Hotel/Resort We stayed at the HHV on our first trip to Oahu and loved it. Since then we have been back several times and never regretted the decision to stay here. Sure you're going to see people on this forum complaining about the expenses of dining, but I think most of these people either have never stayed in a resort hotel before, or just like to complain. Yes, food is more expensive here than some of the other Honolulu hotels but it's right in line with other resorts we've visited. If you want to economize you can go to the ABC store, or walk to McDonalds, but if you want to enjoy the resort...get out your wallet and enjoy yourself. There are excellent places to eat on the property, in fact the best Chinese restaurant on the island is in the Rainbow tower. We love the Japanese restaurant, and even found the Italian restaurant to be well above average. We were disappointed with the Rainbow Lanai buffet, but we don't care much for buffets anyway. What you'll love: The beach is wide, long, and even during the high season not as crowded as you might expect. You'll enjoy the variety of shops at the HHV, no matter what you're looking for chances are they have it. The staff has always been considerate and helpful, and they've bent over backwards at times to correct small problems. We're Hilton Diamond members and that may have helped us to get great service, but only at check-in...the rest of the staff were unaware of our status in Hiltons system. What might bug you: If you don't like crowded elevators and long wait times avoid the Rainbow Tower rooms. If you choose a high floor for the great views expect your waiting and transit times will be fairly long. Don't pick a room in the Rainbow Tower on the corners facing the afternoon sun (opposite Diamond Head). These rooms have two Lanai's but the AC didn't handle the afternoon heat very well. In fact we avoid the Rainbow Tower unless everything else is booked. The Tapa Tower or the Ali'i have better rooms and fewer children. Valet parking is rather slow sometimes. If you're used to the speed of a Las Vegas Valet you'll start foot tapping and pacing at the HHV. Don't pay for the Friday evening pool side show. The drinks are weak, the show not very well done, and the whole experience not worth the money. Try the Paradise Cove Luau instead. We think you'll enjoy the HHV, but expect to pay for things that some other properties give away. If you know what to expect and can afford it you'll be back year after year.

<Content>The best of the best We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Aug 25th - Sept 01 in the Alii tower partial ocean view. What an experience we had. Let me first start by commending the entire staff on the Hilton grounds to include all of the shops and restaurants that we visited. This resort is enormous. The room was beautiful and we felt so spoiled.We had turn down service 3 times a day with chocolates and a flower on our pillows. The pools were great. I am glad though that we had a private pool at the Alii tower because the main pool was very crowded. Everyone we ran into that worked at the HHV (Hilton Hawaiian Village) seemed to be very happy to be employed there. They keep this resort in ship shape. The most beautiful grounds we have ever seen. Great entertainment at the bars nightly. Excellent service and very attentive staff. Overall we have to say that this was by far the most enjoyable place we have ever stayed at. We will be back in the near future!

<Content>To Big We spent one afternoon on the last day of our two week dream vacation @ HHV. The last nights were spent in Waikiki, at the Outrigger on the beach. Check in was fast, service good, nice rooms and grounds @HHV. It is just to big, to many towers and to busy, this hotel had the most crowded pool(S), beach and everything else. It's not a bad place, but if you want to relax and need some space, stay away from the HHV.

<Content>Had a great time!! OK-1st of all, I want to thank the many reviewers on this site for the tips provided about this hotel. That was the main reason I was prepared for what others considered surprising. We arrived Aug 31 2005 and stayed till Sept 5 2005. We were in the Tapa Tower on the 13th floor. 1st let me point out that I have never heard of a hotel in the U.S. having a 13th floor-and every time we got into the elevator and pressed our floor -people always had a comment. However, it was the beginning of a great trip-with no bad luck whatsoever! Our room was of average size and although we booked a village garden view room to save some money-we had a great view on all sides (to the right was a park w/a lot of greenery, front view of Honolulu city, to the left a lovely ocean view) definately more than we bargained for. Also, the Tapa tower in convienently located with the Tapa pool right downstairs, the Tapa bar next to it with nightly entertainment, and the beach not too far away. There were no funny or moldy smells, the AC worked fine, and the beds are the most amazingly comfortable I have ever slept on. The room was cleaned every day, we had plenty of towels, and the sheets are changed only if you put the sign on the bed letting the maids know you want the sheets changed. Definately go to the ABC store, (the one across from the hotel, around the corner from Wailana Coffee House is a little cheaper than the one in the village, but either one is fine) and buy your coffee/filters/tea/sodas/water/snacks/etc. It is indeed outrageous that the hotel would charge for in room coffee (and so much!) especially since you can get it at the ABC store and make it yourself with the in room coffee pot. Other tips: Wailana Coffee House across from hotel for breakfast (from 4.99 to 9.00) lunch and even dinner. Germaine's Luau-below average food, but great show. Book the Pearl Harbor/Circle Island tour thru E'noa Tours w/the American Express Tours/activities desk next to the check in counter with Kit or Julie. An all day tour but worth it! Pearl Harbor, and short stops at Dole Plantation, and a macadamia nut farm, and you see the entire island-great photo ops. Also Round Table Pizza in the Village is reasonable and good.Yes, the pools are shallow- I guess ti limit their liability from people diving -the super pool is only 3 1/2 feet and the Tapa pool 4 1/2 ft. But they are clean and temperature perfect. You want deep? There's a whole ocean a few feet away! And talk about warm water-the ocean is a great big bath (75 to 78 degree water). I came for both a convention and a small vacation, and I was expecting a disneyland-in-California-in-July-like atmosphere, but it just wasn't like that. It was hardly crowded at all-even wth the conventioners in town (about 8500 people, in different hotels of course) along with the usual guests/tourists. Maybe it was the time period in which we went. My son did miss a couple days of school. So I guess this would be a good time to go-after everyone else's vacation time. So we are planning to return here in 2007 but staying at least 7 days. Also if you are in Southern California, I recommend flying Aloha Airlines-they have a non stop flight and they serve food. That way you save on travel time.There are so many good things to say about this trip. But I think I have given a pretty good cliff notes version of my experience with the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I hope it helps others like others helped me.

<Content>Overpriced, overcrowded and over rated Oahu was the final leg of our honeymoon trip, the first two being San Francisco (Westin St Francis) and Las Vegas (Bellagio).We paid the top price for a Ocean Front room in the Rainbow Tower, and I have to say that I was very disappointed in the size and quality of the room, way below that which we had already experienced on our trip. We got unpacked, put on the AC, and noticed a really bad smell, when we checked the vent and noticed that it was covered in a black mould, which didn't bode well for what was going on behind.I went to talk to the manager about the standard of the room and the state of the AC, he said that he would have the AC checked, and would see if we could be moved to another room.The vent was cleaned, but that didn't help the smell, later on that day we were moved to a corner room on the 29th floor, with two balconies, one overlooking the complex, and one overlooking the beach. This was a nicer room, and larger, but the bathroom was still small and nothing like four star standard.The pools were very crowded, impossible to get a bed unless you were there by 9am, $51 for an umbrella and two beds on the beach is just a rip off, walk 100 yards towards town and get them for $20 instead.The food round the pool was very low standard, however there were some nice restaurants, the Italian had great food for instance.Overall the resort is too big, too many shops, in dire need of an overhaul (at least in the Rainbow Tower), and it's living off it's location. I would say without the view the hotel would be lucky to achieve a 3 star rating.

<Content>Lots of Benefits We just returned from a week long stay at the HHV and were very pleased with the overall experience. I will try to explain both the good and the very few negatives.We stayed in the Rainbow tower with a beach view. I definately recommend a room facing the beach. The view is beautiful looking over the main pool with nightly shows (not noisy) and on to a picture perfect beach. The room is a good size, nicely updated, mini fridge and balcony.The facillity is lovely and truly a village of attractions. There are many features on the property, but we most enjoyed the many (approx 20 restaurants), numerous shops from Louis Vitton on down and the several convenience stores all located on property. Also at the Hilton Pier is the submarine ride which is available through the hotel or we used Cheap Tickets at a reduced rate. Housekeeping does a great job keeping this large property clean. I never saw trash, dirty floors, dirty carpet etc.Buy an Entertainment Book before you leave. At least two restaurants on site (Steak House and Upscale Asian) have buy one-get one free coupons. Other attractions are also in the book.The only negatives I can tell you are about extra costs. The room safe is 3.50 per day, valet parking is 18.00 per day (all parking costs), and an umbrella and 2 chairs on the beach is 50.00. I think some of these charges are excessive, but the hotel is a business to make money.I would definately recommend HHV as the excellent facility outweight any negative aspects.Have a good vacation!

<Content>Great Customer Service, But needs Bigger Pool Stayed at the HHV for five nights, 8/23-8/27. Stayed in the Kalia Tower. Had an upgrade to ocean view, just by becoming a Hilton Honors member, free of charge. Our room was nice and clean, however since this tower is set back from the other towers, didn't get a view of Diamond Head. The major problem we encountered with this resort was that the Super Pool was way too small for the amount of people that can stay at this hotel. While we were there the hotel was completley booked. The doorman estimated that about 9,000 people were occupying the hotel at that particular time. The amount of lounge chairs around the Super Pool,which was the main pool, were about 150. Every morning at about 8 o'clock, we had to stand on line like cattle to get lounge chairs. Once the lines were opened at 8:30 people would literally scream and run for chairs. OUTRAGEOUS!!!!! The other much smaller pools were about half the size of the Super Pool and looked like backyard swimming pools, which we noticed was the case at most of the other hotels in Waikiki. The Waikiki beach by HHV is nice, but you must pay 12.50 for a beach chair and $25.00 for an umbrella. This seems to be the case on other islands in Hawaii. FYI, once you enter the ocean, there are many rocks underneath, which you can hurt your feet on. I didn't enjoy that at all. May want to think about bringing water shoes. Ate at Sergio's in the village of HHV, which was very good and had a great waiter. Also ate at Benihana, which was good and fun, (make reservations ahead of time). Also ate at the Round Table for Pizza, had Maui Zaui Pizza, very good; with ham, bacon, cheese, onions and pineapple. A great place for breakfast was the Wailiana Coffee Shop, down the block on Kalia Road on corner, outside of the HHV. Very inexpensive and very good, great french toast filled with guava, coconut syrup for your pancakes, highly recommend, most prices in the $4.99 to $6.99 range for large portions. Great service as well in and out within 45 minutes even if there was a line to get in.Now for the positive!!. We left 2 personal items behind. Realized it when we were at Honolulu Aiport waiting for our flight to Maui. Called the HHV spoke to concierge and told her we couldn't leave for Maui without these 2 items. She quickly contacted Security they retrieved the 2 items and sent them via taxi to the airport. All was taken care of within a 45 minute time frame. We couldn't be more thankful. That is the kind of service I would give 10 stars for.!Would I return to HHV, yes I would. When I compare it to the other hotels in Waikiki, it is one of the better ones and it's at the end of the beach so it is at a much quieter location. I think it does need to maybe build another pool to accomodate 3,000 room resort.

<Content>Incredible staff My husband, 10 yr old son and I went to Hawaii for the first time and stayed here. It was suppose to be my dream vacation. I fell in love with the hotel and it's grounds. So beautiful. Then my husband passed away while we were there on our dream vacation. It was the absolute most difficult time in our lives. We felt as if we were a million miles away from anyone we knew. The staff at The Hilton Hawaiian Village were very comforting and helpful in our time of need. They deleted all of the video game charges my son had accrued and all of the incoming phone calls to our room off of our final bill. They also took care of our transportation to and from the hospital and to the airport. They were wonderful. We plan on going back within the next year or two and definately will stay here again. Thank you so much everyone at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for having such great customer service and understanding.

<Content>Big complex, big bill but still good My family and I have just returned from 7 nights staying in an ocean front room in the Rainbow tower. The whole village is big and is alot to take in on your arrival. The hotel room was nice with 2 double beds and a balcony with lovely view. The bathroom was a bit on the small side. The walls are thin and just hope for quiet neighbours. We did have relatively quiet ones. The grounds are nice and it has the best position and beach section on Waikiki beach.The only things which were annoying was the cost of everything. Even the hire of the sun beds, umbrella costs up to $50.00 a day.The meals in the restaurants are also expensive but it is very easy to eat out close by. Overall a nice hotel if you don't mind big.But generally standards are to a high standard.

<Content>Doesn't Deserve the Bad Reviews We arrived on a Saturday afternoon ... we reserved the lowest price room on the Internet (although both husband and I are Honors members). There were tons of people checking in for a convention, however, we had less than a five minute wait through the Honors check-in line.They no longer had any garden view rooms with two doubles (we had our two teenagers with us). However, after a little patient waiting (maybe 10 minutes) and no complaining on our side, they placed us in an ocean view 2-room suite in the Diamond Head tower. Talk about excellent service! Thank you!The beds were extremely comfortable, the room was kept immaculate all throughout our stay and the view was incredible. Every person in every restaurant and store throughout the property was incredibly friendly and efficient. More importantly, we never saw the throngs of people checking in for the convention (they were in meetings all day). The beach was decent (best in Waikiki, anyhow) and the pools were not overcrowded.There were numerous dining options both within the resort and within a few blocks of the resort for all budgets. Overall, we had a great stay and will be returning.

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian Village: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly I just came back from a Four Day stay. We were in the Kalia Tower from August 23rd through the 26th. I have to say that every review, both good and bad is 100% correct. The problem with this hotel/resort is that it is not properly managed! The observations from most of my encounters at the Hotel were that customer service has not yet be i integrated in to the workplace.You can be at one part of the hotel and enjoy great service and then at another part of the Hotel you feel you like you've entered the Twilight Zone and landed at the Motel 6. We did a precheck in and noon and were told to we would receive a call at 2:00pm to check in, we never received the call. When we arrived to get our keys for the room in spite of being told everything was ready it took them 35 minutes to get us room keys and another hour to find our bags they had checked for us. I must admit that I have never stayed at a Major Hotel Resort where the employees of the Hotel smiled so little and pretty much were content that the service was poor. I finally spoke to the assistant manager on duty who refunded me $50 for my dinner problems but did little to solve any of the problems. As I said early on the problem with this Hotel is the management.There were some bright spots though, The SPA services and personal, something I did not see many people write about were outstanding, the saving grace of the Hotel and the reason I would consider returning. I later found out from the Manager of the Hotel that the Spa is an independent company which operates separately from the Hotel. Which might explain why the service was outstanding. Also the people at Crazy Shirts were great as well as the people at Benihana's which by the way is a place I would not normally eat at back home. Unlike some other people who stayed at the Hilton I had excellent service from the people who manned the hotel beach/towel services. In fact one of the guys helped to make sure we were checked in right on time. Maybe he should be running the Hotel as he knew more about Customer Service than the people responsible for running the Hotel.Of all the things that bothered me the most, worst than the bad food and lousy food service, (it took 45 minutes for any type of room service and even when the Hotel forgot to delivery us the Soup we had ordered they said it would take an additional 45 minutes to ship us the Soup they forgot with out order,) was the contest sales pitch I got three times a day from Hotel personnel trying to sell me Grand Vacation Hotel Timeshares. I asked them to stop but every time we had a question with their customer service the person tried to sell us something. And none of the Free Gifts we were told we would receive for staying at the Hotel ever arrived.Every time we ventured outside of the Hotel we encountered wonderful service. My Daughter and I went Horseback Riding at the Kualoa Ranch and I highly recommend this to everyone it was a great. By the way all of our outside adventures and travel were found through the great booklet that Hertz Rent A Car provided us. The Hotel Concierges are a complete waste of time. We asked for directions to the Blue Water Grill and we were told this was a ten minute car ride. Thanks to our car being equipped with Never lost we did arrive for our reservations but we were 30 minutes late as it is quite a bit more than 10 minutes away but still worth it.This Hotel is in need of a major management overhaul. I've stayed at other Hilton's, The New York Hilton for example the customer service and rooms were excellent. The manager of this Hotel should be sent out to fix the HHV.

<Content>A good time at the Hilton Hawaiian Village The big resort on the west end of Waikiki beach was nice. The pools were clean and if you got there early a chair was always available. The hotel was clean and its employees were very friendly, and helpful. Our room had a partial view of the ocean and was not really that important to us. We only used it for sleep and a place to get cleaned up, so we were almost never there.We saved our Subway club cards while in Ohio and took them to Hawaii with us, 2 cards = 1 foot long sub with the purchase of a drink so lunch was $1.50, we just got lucky that a Subway was outside our hotel. We bought rum and coke at a local store (ABC stores are everywhere) and discreetly mixed our own drinks using hotel cups by the pool, we even had fresh ice and limes. (The pool servers would always ask if we needed more drinks, but every time they cam back we had a fresh drink, they never caught on)A bike rental was also just outside the hotel grounds, we used this as our means of transport, even riding them to the base of Diamond Head and back. Using bikes we saw more of the City and were able to see restaurants and bars that we might have missed in a cab. I felt because the hotel is so far west we were really are not on the hot spot of Waikiki Beach and felt a little left out of the action.I have pictures of the Hilton on my website www.eyestothesky.net

<Content>Wasted our time and money. My wife  I spent two nights in Honolulu's Hilton Hawaiian Village before going to Maui for five nights. We shouldn't have wasted our time  money on HHV. First of all, Honolulu is not my idea of a tropical paradise. It is way too crowded with skyscrapers and traffic jams to rival New York City...almost.We had booked our room in the Kalia tower on the excutive floor. The executive lounge served complimentry breakfast  afternoon snacks, both very mediocre in both selection and quality, hardly worth the extra cost.The rooms were spacious and nicely appointed. Private lobby made check in  check out a breeze. We were glad at not having to go to the bustling and chaotic main lobby for check in.The hotel is huge, VERY HUGE, and very crowded. At 10:30 am beach was crowded beyond imagination. Hotel charges $50/day rental for an umbrella and two beach chairs!! We may have spent that money but there was not a single decent spot left to set up our umbrella. Main pool area was no better, way too crowded. Luckily someone mentioned that Kalia tower had a private pool and hot tub on the 4th floor. That's where we spent the rest of our day. On our next trip to Hawaii, we will either skip Honolulu or choose some other smaller resort.

<Content>Nightmare Worst experience I've ever had with a Hotel. I will probably never stay at another Hilton after this. It started with check in and having the wrong reservations all the way to my Hilton Honors which they didn't reward because they issued my reservations under the wrong name. Plus they charged us $50 dollars night more than what they originally told us because of their mess up with our reservations. We couldn't even get the manager to help us. Total nightmare. Hotel had a horrible musty smell and was not worth the money. Plus we had to wait in line for everything. They even make you accountable for the towels you borrow at the pool and they treat you like they can't trust anyone. The teenagers aren't even allowed to use your cards without you being there. Stayed at other hotels in Hawaii and it was a much better experience for alot less and not so crowded.

<Content>Should have stayed in a three star We arrived hoping to relax and get ready for dinner at around 4pm, the room was not ready. I was told (as if it were my fault) to come back in 1 hour and given a pager. We went driving around for about an hour and a half (was never paged), finally our room in the diamondhead tower was ready. Room was run of the mill, nothing extraordinary. Not as clean as I would expect (for the money), we had a view of the ocean and down below was construction and lots of noise. Hotel is nice, but when you're in Hawaii, paying good money, you expect more. I did get help from the agents at the american express counter, planning some of our excursions, they were very helpful.Next time I will stay in a condo for less money and more room.

<Content>Not the place for a chilling time Ohau has a population of around 850,000.....849,000 of them would seem to be in the Hawaiian Village!! We stayed for one week in the Ali'i Tower. The staff were friendly  helpful, the rooms were great, clean  comfortable, air con, fridge etc but the village  Waikiki resort are absoultely heaving with tourists  locals. We agree with the other reviews about the prices, they are quite over the top....$50 a day to rent 2 sunbeds  a beach umbrella, restaurants on site aren't cheap either [althought the Pizza place is reasonable  good]. Our recommendation is to buy an ice box, go to Wal-mart, pack a picnic  head off over the other side of the island [about 45mins drive] its far less crowded  you can swim with sea turtles all day long for no extra charge!

<Content>Bad Smell....but comfortable beds We stayed at the Alli tower for our honeymoon. When we checked into the hotel we had a horrible smell in our room and it took three compliants before we were upgraded to Ocean view on our last night. The beds are very comfortable....feels like a pillow top. This place was very crowded but the key is hang out by the 2nd floor pool where it is less crowded, the free apps from 5-7 are nice too. The Alli tower is the place to be in this village.

<Content>Hilton Delivers Fun and Sun with Flair My husband, 16 year old daughter, 15 year old niece, and I recently enjoyed a refreshing 11 night stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village - a definite tropical paradise. As a Hilton Honors member we were able to have a smooth check-in through the Hilton Honors check-in line, but I noticed a somewhat lengthy check-in line for non-Honors members. Everyone is welcomed with a beverage on check-in. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite in the Diamond Head Tower. We absolutely loved it. There is a car rental company on site if guests decide to rent a car for all or part of their stay. Although we rented a car to enjoy the island during our stay, one could stay at this resort and use the public transportation to see the Honolulu and Waikiki areas and save money. In fact, we walked around much of the Waikiki area from the resort to avoid the hassle of reparking the car (which usually costs money per hour). Daily self parking at the resort is $15 dollars ($19 if you want valet) and although it may seem pricey, it is less than parking in some other US metropolitan areas. Our suite was very clean with great service although the room was somewhat dated. The beds were very comfortable with plush top sheets. We had a pull-out couch in the living area with good sound control between the living area and sleeping area so the television watchers did not disturb the sleepers. Our room had a fridge which was nice as we were able to stock up on drinks at the local Walmart and avoid the higher priced beverages stocked in the room. We had a partial ocean view and a nice balcony area to sit out on and relax. We liked having the shops and animals about on the property. However, if you dislike hustle and bustle then this is not the place for you. During the day the beach can be very crowded and the umbrellas and beach chairs are extra. We really enjoyed the beach in the evening when it was not crowded at all. The girls enjoyed some of the free resort activities and they were disappointed they missed out on the free lei making classes (be sure to reserve in advance). Snorkeling lessons are available as well on the property. The resort is within walking distance to the Ala Moana Mall which is a plus if you have teenagers. Some of the resort restaurants are pricey, but there is a cafe just across the street from the resort that is reasonably priced and on the property one of the Japanese restaurants (Hatsuhana's) has a cheese omelet special breakfast for $7 with rice that is decent. This restaurant also has a Happy Hour from 3 to 7 with special prices on beer. Be sure to try Lappert's Ice Cream parlor for some excellent tropical ice cream flavors. On Friday nights there is an awesome fireworks display with entertainment that adults and children will both enjoy (come a early for the best seating). We found all of the staff to be very polite and helpful. We did not participate in the timeshare sale, but for those who are interested you can pick up $100 Hawaiian Hilton dollars to spend on the property by listening to a 90 minute sales pitch within 48 hours of your arrival. There is a business center with internet access for 33 cents a minute (daytime hours) with a $5 minimum. It would be nice if complimentary internet access was available. Also, at times there was a short wait to get a computer terminal. However, having a post office on the site was a definite plus and we were able to mail out our packages with relative ease. My husband said that staying at the resort was the best part of the vacation. We would definitely stay here again - I waffled beween rating this resort above average or excellent - judge for yourself. In fact, we had been considering Alaska for our next vacation but we had such a great time here we may come back again next year.

<Content>Exceeded Expectations! I used Trip Advisor as a planning tool for my families recent trip to Hawaii and wanted to share my thoughts on our trip to paradise. We stayed 5 days on Oahu at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and 5 days at the Grand Wailea on Maui. We have a family of four with a 12 year old son and a 9 year old daughter. The vacation was like two trips in one. Oahu is hustle and bustle and lots of things to do...and fun! We stayed at the HHV and it is BIG, but, we had an amazing time there. Service and facitilites were EXCELLENT. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower with OV and would book the same again. We did Pearl Harbor...good. Snorkeled at Hanauma Bay...Simply Amazing. Dolphin Quest at the Kahala Mandarin...best part of the trip for the kids. On Maui at the Grand Wailea, a quiet, tropical paradise! If you're staying with kids...hands down, the GW is the place to go. I walked down to the Kea Lani and Four Seasons, both spectacular properties, but your kids will kill you if you didn't go to the GW and have fun at all the water/pool amenities. Spa was good at GW, but expensive. Only bust for my family was the Road to Hana...I wouldn't waste a day on this...no one in my family really enjoyed this long trip (just us I guess!). My personal favorite experience was taking a snorkel trip to Molikini with Trilogy Excursions...you must go on this trip - it was the greatest! Also attended the Feast at LeLe - another wonderful treat. Not too grown up for older kids. The show was amazing and food was to die for. Can't wait to come back to Hawaii again!

<Content>Awesome, fun-filled family vacation! My family and I recently stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village from 8/10/05-8/15/05. From the moment we arrived, the staff treated us like royalty. Our rooms were located in the rainbow tower and the rooms couldnt have been more clean or comfortable. They were spacious and the bathroom was very modern and well lit. The beach was literally steps away from the elevator. Although the restaurants on-site were a bit high priced for our budget, there were plenty of eating facilites located nearby within walking distance. If there is anything to complain about this hotel was that it is just too big, too many stores to see. I highly recommend this hotel for your hawaiian vacation. (Oh, and dont forget to ask about their time share presentations, it will pay off.)

<Content>Wonderful resort but crowded We had a wonderful time in Hilton. Very nice resort though extremely crowded. We stayed in the Kalia tower - very nice rooms. I f you are planning on taking surfing lessons dont do it at the Hilton - it costs $85. Keep walking down the Waikiki beach you will find places for $45, $35 and even $25. The $25 one is just beyond the Dukes restaurant.

<Content>Some good, some bad This is a well organised, busy hotel and the staff were very helpful and friendly.The grounds are very picturesque and there are animals such as penguins and ducks. There are also a wide range of shops (although they are expensive) within the hotel grounds. An ABC small supermarket is also available within the grounds where you can purchase water, food etc at more reasonable prices.The towel service on the beach was also very useful whereby you can loan as many free towels as you wish to be returned at the end of the day. Parasols and sun loungers were also available. The parasols were about 拢15 a day to hire.We were upgraded to a partial ocean view on arrival due to space being available. The main negative aspects issues I have with the hotel are the cleanliness of the room. The room was not clean when we arrived and although the towels were replaced daily, the beds were not fully made and the room was never hoovered or surfaces wiped thoroughly. In addition I believe some aspects of the room were a little worn and dated and are in need of a refurbishment. Therefore overall, although my stay was pleasant, I believe there are hotels which offer better value for money along the Waikiki beach. In particular the more reasonably priced Outrigger with it's excellent location nearer to the main shopping street looked like it may have been better value for money.

<Content>You can do a lot better with your money With great anticipation, we arrived at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for a 2-night stay before traveling on to Maui for a 7-day stay.Why is it when you spend $500 per night for a room at the Hilton they nickel and dime you to death with fees for everything but you can stay at a Hampton Inn (owned by Hilton) and get the same services for free? For example, Hilton promised me wireless internet in my room (although it was a vacation, I did have to work each day). Guess what, wireless internet in the Diamondhead Tower doesn't work. I had to go out to the bar in the main area to get access...especially fun at night with no lights and a ban blaring in the bar. When I explained the problem with the manager, her response was, you shouldn't be working on vacaction. We had four people in our room and when we checked in, there were two towels. Two our our lamps did not work (never fixed), the pull-out bed didn't have a blanket (never replaced), the clock radio didn't work (never fixed) and the TV set was missing its remote control (replaced after 2 phone calls). Room service trays sat in the hallway from 6 pm to 3 pm the following day. The rooms were in serious needs of updating. Don't even get us started about the charges for beach chairs and umbrellas. I especially enjoyed the explanation the beach guy gave me as to why chairs were extra (public beach, not controlled by Hilton, a separate business). When I inquired as to why his name tag had a Hilton logo on it, he walked away and would not answer my question. The bed was comfy, the view from our room was great, and the complimentary breakfast we got (because I have Hilton Rewards Gold status) was excellent.However, don't rip me off. Just tell my my room costs $600 per night, I get an umbrella at the beach, two chairs, I can use the safe in my room, wireless internet access, and I can park my car in your garage. We definitely will not stay here again nor would we recommend it to anyone else.

<Content>Hilton was okay I stayed at the Hilton from July 31st through August 3rd based on reviews I read on TripAdvisor. While there was nothing specifically wrong with the hotel, I probably will not stay again, it was just too busy. That being said, when we checked in we were told they were fully booked given that it was peak vacation season.Like most reviewers we got upgraded upon our arrival, we has a partial ocean front view in the Diamond Tower. Our room was suffciently modern and had a very nice terrace from which we could watch the sea. On our second to last night, there was a leak in the ceiling and the staff promtly moved us to a junior suite which was even nicer. The suite had a terrace the size of our original room and we had a nice sitting room which gave us a place escape the Waikiki craziness.Like most of Waikiki, the Hotel was very crowded but had it all. As you will read on its website and all the reviews, the Hilton is its own self contained city, with a number of shops and resturants to chose from. Coming from New York City, both prices and options were okay. We were pleasantly surprised by the bookstore which had a number of good titles and the various Japanese noodle bars.With respect to the beach, I had hoped that it would be less busy given that it was at the end of Waikiki...I was wrong, throngs of people. Plus like the rest of Waikiki, there was virtually no shade available (unless you were willing to pay for an umbrella)Again, there was nothing specifically bad about the Hilton, just a little too zoo-ish for my husband and I. Also, while I thought I was getting a bargain at $209 a night, once I added on the various costs such as breakfast, parking etc, I probably would have done better at one of the higher end hotels. Next time, I think we will probably just stay in a BB or resort on the North Shore or just pass on Oahu all together.

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian, Aug. 2005 I just returned from 3 days at the Hilton Hawaiin Village. I was upgraded to an ocean view in the Ali'i tower. Do whatever you can to stay in this building. They have their own private pool, so it's pretty easy to find a chair at any time. Be aware that there are only 5 umbrellas and people will put out towels very early (around 8:0am) and finally decide to go the the pool around noon. this really annoyed me and it's too bad they will not control that. Ali'i tower also serves appetizers from 5:00 to 7:00. The only other thing that bothered me was the parking. $15 to park and $19 for vallet. Otherwise, I would recomend this hotel. If your into diving, use Island Divers. They will pick you up at the hotel and they do a very good job. I did the Corsair wreck and China Wall.

<Content>A Corner of Paradise I spent 7/30 - 8/7/2005 in Hawaii.First 2 nights stayed at Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach, which was wonderful except that Waikiki Beach is so narrow and crowded.Moved to Hilton Hawaiian Village (to attend a wedding) for the next 6 nights and loved it.It had a beautiful beach, big and wide, not hustling and bustlling but calmer.The hotel had a great location within walking distance of all the other hotels on Waikiki. We stayed in the Kalia Tower and our room had a nice view. Plus the lanais were more private than at the Outrigger. There were no mold or mildew odors as mentioned in another review and the rooms were spotlessly clean. The rooms were quiet. No noise from next door. I didn't hear any construction noises either. The staff was pleasant and cooperative.As at the other hotels in Waikiki, lounge chairs by the pools were hard to come by; people came early, claimed their chairs by leaving towels or magazines on them, then left. The HHV had a policy that if a chair was not occupied for 45 minutes the items on it would be removed; but unfortunately it wasn't enforced. The Kalia Tower had its own pool on the 4th floor which was rarely crowded. The Tapas pool was also very nice - nicely landscaped and near one of the bars which made great Mai Tais. And not a screaming child to be found.I was disappointed with the Super Pool. It wasn't as large as what I imagined from the description or as super. I thought the pools at Disney World's Caribbean Beach resort and Dixie Landings were much more super: very large, more interestingly shaped and better landscaping.HHV also had a variety of restaurants to choose from including a Benihana.There was also a pizzeria where you could take out and it was reasonably priced. The food at Bali's was out of this world. The filet mignon was superb. The breakfast buffet at Outrigger was fantastic. Truly all you could eat and everything was included in the $12.95 price (unlimited coffee, tea, juices: oj. guava, pineapple, papaya, etc, etc.) The freshest fruit and the sweetest pineapple. Omelette station, sausages, bacon,. muffins, croissants, potatoes, hot and cold cereals, waffles, pancakes, french toast, etc. etc.I have to admit I didn't try the breakfast buffet at the Hilton simply because it was overpriced ($19.95) and what more could they offer that the Outrigger didn't. Plus the famous Eggs N Things was very close to the Hilton and everything you read about it is true. The food is great (macadamia nut pancakes and waffles, or pancakes and waffles with fresh fruit and piled high with whipped cream, and, of course, all kinds of omelettes) very reasonably priced, too.A couple of things I didn't like about the Hilton: parking was $15.00 a day, more for valet parking. I thought that was a rip-off. And to use the safe in your room was $3.65 a day, a lot of hotels offer this convenience at no charge. It's in your room anyway, you input your own code. So what are you paying for?? But what annoyed me the most was paying for the coffee they provided in the rooms. $6.00 a bag which only made 1 - 2 cups depending on the strength. We were also charged for tea bags! I have done a lot of traveling - to the Caribbean, Europe, Canada and all over the USA - never was I required to pay for the coffee in the room.Would I go back to the Hilton? Absolutely. It was a truly wonderful resort.But next time I won't rent a car (there's really no need, the transportation in Oahu is great), I won't bring any jewelry and I'll bring my own coffee and tea bags.

<Content>Straight Talk about Ali'i Tower Hilton Hawaiian Village Just spent one week at the Ali'i Tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. There were several pros: private pool; great bed; private check-in; Crabtree  Evelyn amenities; Doorman wonderful with lots of helpful tips..... As for the cons:Daily charge for the in-room safe ($3.50/day); Nominal fee for breakfast in the Tower Terrace Lounge is $14 per person - not so nominal; carpets stained in room; furniture just so so; hard to reach the front desk; wireless not reliable.All in all, an OK stay but did not meet expectations set by others in this forum

<Content>Paradise with a few problems We took our children, 15 and 10, on a 10 day Hawaiian vacation and spent 5 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian. The grounds are outstanding and the wildlife(penguins and huge goldfish) kept my 10 year old entertained for part of the time. On arrival we were pleasantly surprised to find we had been upgraded to the Rainbow Tower which is directly on the ocean and in close proximity to the pool. The rooms are a good size and the beds got raves from each one of us. A couple of problems with towels and a lamp were corrected immediately. Be forewarned that it is a bustling place and not a serene tropical paradise. All the while we were there (7/35-7/30) finding a spot by the pool was practically impossible. The beach is clean and if you prefer not to spend the $$ to rent the umbrellas locate yourselves underneath one of the palm trees on the right hand side of the beach which offers free shade all day long. Had breakfast every morning at the Wailana Coffee House, which a previous reviewer recommended, and they were right as I had the best coffee there as anywhere on the island and it is a simple 2 minute walk from the hotel. Problems were the fees attached to everything - what hotel doesn't have a fitness room available free of charge? How do you justify the $3.25 daily fee for in-room safes when most everywhere else they are part of the room accommodations! and nowhere on the safe does it mention the fee, however if you look at the fine print in the phone book size directory of the facility it does mention it there. I had read there was a coin-op laundry on site but discovered this is no longer and I would need to lug my laundry down the street approximately 10 minutes to get it done. I waited until we arrived at the Sheraton Maui and did it there. Expect to wait in line for the daily towel dispensing which makes absolutely no sense as they ask for your room number, never write it down and when you return it at the end of the day there is noone taking notice of who returned what??? The high rise aspect did give a different perspective of the island but I doubt I would return to this hotel if I am lucky enough to travel back to Hawaii in my lifetime.

<Content>A Welcome Surprise My husband and I just returned from 4 nights (7/31-8/3) at the HHV (followed by 3 nights at The Fairmont Kea Lani on Maui) with two other couples. We had a great time and were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the HHV. We stayed in the Ali'i Tower because it was advertised as adult only, with an adult only pool. While we did encounter children, it did not detract from our experience. We found the rooms to be spacious and clean. The views were fabulous, the bed was exceptionally comfortable (think Heavenly Bed from Westin) and the service was timely. The decor is a little kitschy, but acceptable. Everyone at the front desk, valet and restaurants were very friendly and accommodating. I was slightly put off by the price of the chair/umbrella rentals and the fitness center fees, but thought the room prices reasonable under the circumstances ($279/night, including continental breakfast, for deluxe ocean view). The free continental breakfast was quite good, with assorted pastries, breads, fruits and cereals. The beach was lovely, moderately crowded and accessible. Overall, I think the HHV compared favorably to the overly generous 5 star rated Fairmont on Maui (see related review). The only unpleasant part of the trip was eating at Dukes. It was uncomfortably hot in the restaurant, the food was average (but overpriced) and the service was awful. While it really is a village unto itself, the HHV is a bit of a hike to downtown Waikiki -- making cabs necessary and expensive. A nice hotel closer to the action was the Moana Surfride. I'd give it a try next time! The HHV was definitely more than I expected and I would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>HHV: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Aloha, My husband and I went to HHV for our honeymoon. This was not our first choice as we had to cancel our trip to the Mayan Riviera due to Hurricane Emily in July.The GoodTHe HHV is absolutely beautiful. It has amazing tropical gardens and rare birds and animals. The scenary is breathtaking and the HHV has the best location on Waikiki as it has the largest size beach compared to the other hotels. It is also at the end which gives it a sort of seclusion from the overcrowded hotels on the rest of the beach. We stayed in the Rainbow tower in a corner room which gave us two balconies with a view of the harbor and the ocean. The room was beautful and the bed was vey comfortable. Good service from staff.The BadTHe HHV is very busy. Lots of families. We would have enjoyed a more quitier place. If you are planning a honeymoon, consider a few nights in Maui and Honolulu. Waikiki offers excellent shopping and good night life for those who enjoy it.The Ugly The resort is nothing like an all-inclusive in Mexico. You pay for eveything here: coffee and bottled water in rooms ($1.50-$2.50), room safe ($3.25 per day), beach chairs ($10.00 per day) and beach umbrellas ($25.00 per day). The beach chairs and umbrella was a surprise to me as we have never paid for this before. The restaurants on the resort are pretty expensive, okay for a few nights but will get pretty pricey for the whole vacation. Some tipsGo for breakfast, lunch or dinner to the Wailana coffee house across the street on Ala Moana BLvd. It is very reasonable ($4.99 all you can eat pancakes plus 2 eggs and 2 bacon). Also, walk down Kalakua to the International Market (about 10 minute walk) place for some cheap shopping (this is like Mexico, you can bargain). There is beautiful jewelry here. Have dinner at the Cheesecake factory (across from the market place), has big portions for very reasonable prices and the food and service is great. Other good restaurants include Duke's in the Outrigger hotel next to Cheesecake factory. It has good dining and beautiful view of the beach. Get early to restaurants in waikiki as it gets very busy after 6pm. Do the Pearl Harbor Circle Island tour with E'noa Tours ($47.00 per adult). It picks you up at 6am and return at 5pm, but it is worth it. You will visit beautiful beaches and amazing landmarks. Also, visit the Polynesian cultural center and book the Ali'i Luau package ($97.00 per person). You get the history on the islands of polynesia and get to enjoy a real hawaiian feast. There is lots to do here. Visit the American Express Tours desk in the main lobby to book your activities. It is worth it. I hope this helps. Aloha!

<Content>Great place if you don't mind spending the money! We recently stayed in the Kalia tower of the village and had a great trip. The room was immaculate with the most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept in. The service varied depending on what you needed. The place is so big, often the people you asked didn't know the specific answer to your question. I was rather surprised that everything had such a high price tag. With the cost of the hotel, I did not imagine we would have to pay for using the gym, etc. but you do. Of course, many of the pricey items is what you expect when staying in the captive resort environment. If you want to go somewhere else to eat, downtown Waikiki and Honolulu are easily accessible. I would definitely recommend this place to couples or families looking for a nice place to stay who don't mind paying some extra money.

<Content>Loved It! July 19th -25th 2005Read mostly good reviews and some bad...realized the bad ones were 4th of July weekend! I LOVED IT! When I got off the plane and realized Ohau was a tropical New York I was extremely let down. However, arriving at the HHV saved it. It was nice, clean, elegant for an island and professional. The staff was great. We had a beautfiul ocean view room in the RainBow Towe(the tower to stay in). The room was nice and clean. The balacony was a good size with chairs and tables and a rack for drying swim suits and towels. The beach was wonderful. At bit pricey to rent chairs and umbrellas but they were always available and not sold out. Our week Subway convention had bought out most of the resort..completed booked; however, you could still always find a place on the beach and your own space. We did not spend time at the pools but they were nice and did not seem overly crowded to me. Food: Nice places were not that high and they also had a great pizza place and deli that were extremely reasonable. The ABC store on sight was not overpriced at all. The place really is a village. GREAT shopping on site. Good prices and great salespeople. All friendly and willing to chat it up and not sell you. Tropics on the beach a great place to have lunch and drinks. Good food and good prices. Ohau though: the trollies are crowded and SLOW. Pay the parking fee at the hotel it is worth it. We had a Jeep the first half and then decided we did not need it. Bad decision. Anyway..HHV - great family place as well. If you do not like kids you will not like it. We did not have our daughter with us and I found myself planning all her activites when we return. All the kids were well behaved and not loud. I strongly suggest HHV. All the other hotel are crammed together and no beach space. HHV is on the end with plenty of room and is nice and quiet in the evenings. Still in good walking distance to all other hotels and beaches. Hope I help! This site helped me!

<Content>PARADISE! My family and I stayed at HHV for our first trip to Hawaii and it was beyond belief. From the moment we pulled up to the lobby to check in, we were astounded by how beautiful the property is. The pools, the shops, the restaurants, the bars were all right there. AND penguins!!! waterfalls and tropical flowers and the nightly lighting of the torch ceremony - it was just so amazing. The sleeping rooms were fine and clean - but that's not always my main concern as we don't spend a whole lot of time in the room except to crash each night. A great hint - we stop by the ABC shop each morning to pick up bottled water and pre-made sandwiches before we head off for our excursions each day. It was convenient and inexpensive. Things to do - Polynesian Cultural Center, Diamondhead, Pali Highway, Hanauma Bay (A MUST! get there early), North Shore, Ala Moana Shopping Center. Hilton Hawaiian Village really contributed to our overall pleasure and experience of Hawaii - we loved it so much we bought the timeshare and went back to Hawaii last year and we already plan to go back again in 2007!!!

<Content>Wish I was there now! From the moment we got out of the cab, that is my son (21) and my daughter (18) and me (their mom) we all knew this place was something special. How right we were. The room was so nice if I wasn't in Hawaii I would have stayed in it more. It was super clean. I loved the turn down service, and my chocolates on my pillow. Going to sleep was like a dream. The staff was great. When ever I needed any thing they were right there. The food was great too. They have food from all over the world. We ate different things every night. The grounds were clean and the pool was too. After sitting on the beach and looking at the ocean was so relaxing I hated to leave. I have to say We all enjoyed our specail vacation. If I could I would go back in heart beat. I would tell everyone that the Hilton Hawaiian Village is the nicest place my family and I ever went to. Aloha Carol Jean

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian Village - The Lowdown Just returned from the village The resort is truly huge. It's not a viilage, more a town. It's bustling and energetic. After 2 weeks we believe we still haven't discovered all that it has to offer. BUT.....It's not cheap. To start with, we were in the Rainbow Tower . The rooms are ok. We had spent in excess of $1700 for a deluxe ocean view, Hiltons definition of an Ocean View is very generous in our opinion. When we got to the room we looked out on the condominium tower (around 50%) The small boat harbour (around 30%) and if you went to the balcony edge and looked to the left, you could see the sea. We wern't happy  went to the desk  explained. They were suprised that we felt that way and was offered another room further along on the same side of the tower at $80 per day supplement which we declined but eventually got a room further along the tower after 5 days which had a bit better view but not a lot. They charge for a lot of items. eg, If you want to use the safe in the room it's $3.25 per day. Tea/coffee/water in room is all chargeable. We wanted an umbrella  2 loungers on the beach. Certainly for $51 per day. If you have had enough on the beach by lunchtime Hilton will rent out the same equipment that they have been paid for for a full day to someone else for $51 for the day. They are raking it in from the guests. If you hire a car, it will cost you $13 per day to self park it on site  $18 for valet parking. There are things going on most nights but there is no board telling you what's going on. There are strict rules for getting towels for the beach  for using the pool area but you have to find them out. They are not easily displayed. Room service as regards cleaning in our opinion is mediocre at best. We were in 2 rooms on two different floors, so had different cleaners. Not good at all. The hotel is around 1陆 miles from Waikiki so if you want to get to the heart of what's going on  enjoy the place (Highly recommended), it's a taxi, bus or a walk dependant on your constitution, purse. It's a lovely place, but could be better if they stopped trying to get money out of you by the back door.

<Content>Hats off to Hilton Hawaiian Village What a great Hotel! This Hotel has it all. Spent 5 days here recenty and enjoyed it to the max. Stayed in the Ali'i tower. The room was immaculate and full of the amenities you would expect. Great pool, beautiful large beach area, lots of shopping for the ladies, and great restaurants and activities closeby. My kids had a great time also-ocean area perfect for children. What puts this hotel over the top is the atmosphere and service.Interacted with staff from restaurants, bell service, front desk, activities,doorman etc. -everyone was very friendly and eager to take care of your needs. The only other aspect I would like to mention is the hotel is very busy but the staff handles it well. If you are looking for a secluded getaway this is not the place, but for a family its perfect. One last comment , Hilton does a great job of giving you a resort atmosphere the village which is secluded from the city atmosphere which surrounds it. We would return.

<Content>Good with children, just okay for adults Not a bad hotel, but certainly not a great one either. Very reasonably priced and decent, but not spectacular rooms. As with most Hiltons, they could use a few upgrades in the rooms, especially on the bedding, the bathroom, and the carpets throughout the property. And, this is picky I know, but, employees clothing/uniform is severly outdated. Eating in their beautiful restaurant was like being waiting on by Alice in Mel's diner. Still, the staff was pleasant enough - not excellent enough to provoke great tips, but not bad enough to make a complaint.But, if you want a great rate and a good place with kids, this works. The Kids club was good, the pool is great and the prices to eat are very reasonable. And, you can always do what I did to avoid the bathroom if you are picky like me. I worked out and used the spa - which is in the Tapa tower. The spa is nice, but lounge areas are small though well maintained.

<Content>Crass and commercial They couldn't be more indifferent. Go anywhere else. As one of their own employees said; It's extremely overpriced and expensive because of what you don't get.

<Content>loved the ali'i tower This was our first trip to Hawaii and we stayed in Oahu for 5 days. Since it was only a stop over for our real honeymoon in Tahiti, we decided to stay in a more reasonable hotel and booked an ocean view in the Ali'i tower (compared to hotels in Tahiti $370 a night was reasonable). We loved the Ali'i tower and all its amenities. It was truly worth the extra money for a separate check-in, separate pool, complementary hor' dourves on the patio, private concierge (aloha Sydney!). The beds were the most comfortable hotel beds, the view was spectacular and the location on Waikiki beach could not be beat. I do think that the staff could be a wee bit more friendly as staff in some of the other hotels were, but it didn't detract at all...things were pricey in hawaii, but we're from nyc, so we're used to those prices, my only pet peeve was paying for the safe...

<Content>Great hotel, but stay in the Kalia Tower (not Tapa) This is the second time I've stayed at this resort. The resort itself is fabulous, the best on Waikiki. However, your room experience will vary depending upon the tower where you are located. The first time I stayed here in Sept. '04, I was in the Kalia Tower, which was excellent. It is one of the resort's newest towers. As a Hilton Honors member, we were upgraded to the executive level and had free breakfast and snacks, all for $200/night. For this trip (July '05), we stayed in the Tapa Tower. Not as nice. Was not given an upgrade. The room is older, and the bathroom always had a mildewy smell. Had a partial ocean view, though. When you make your reservation, you should call the hotel and request the tower that you want. Kalia is the way to go, not Tapa.

<Content>Nice hotel but too impersonal My husband and I stayed in the Tapa tower July 8-15 2005. We had specifically requested a king bed when we booked 6 weeks ago but they were unable to accomodate us upon check-in. We were put in a room with 2 doubles. The next morning I called to see if they could switch us and was told nothing had opened up and they didn't anticipate being able to move us for the entire stay. I expressed my displeasure again and upon furthur checking they were able to find a king room. The room we were moved to was pretty nice - large room, nice view, but in my opionion was dated and in need of some renos. If you require any assistance from the front desk, don't bother going down there - huge line ups. You're better off calling, hopefully they call you back if they are too busy. It was a pretty nice hotel but it really lacks personality. Not too sure I would go back.

<Content>Awesome!!! My son (12) and I stayed in the Rainbow Tower, 29th floor. The view was spectacular, the accommadations were great and the people and workers were extremely friendly. The pool does get crowded but if you get there early your are sure to get a chair. The kids will not need a chair since they will be running the entire day. There are great places to eat, steakhouses, Japnaese, etc and nothing anymore expensive than the Outback in NC. We had a wondrful, wonderful time and we plan on returning in July/06

<Content>Ohio loves the Hilton My wife, two boys (12  16) and I stayed at in the Ali'i Tower July 1 - 6 and loved it. The Ali'l tower is closest to the beach, offers the best service of the various Hilton towers on the grounds and would be my first choice when we return. Our room was immaculate, cleaned several times daily, and we could be on the beach within one minute of getting in the elevator. Also, the Ali'i offers it's own check-in desk which keeps you out of the BIG lines at the main check-in desk which covers all the other towers. When you go, save money by buying daily supplies (pop, water, lotion) at the ABC store on the grounds...a very busy place. The Super Pool wasn't that impressive and the seats were all filled all day...but we didn't care one bit because the beach was awesome and we were very happy to be out there all day. The Hilton is at the end of Waikiki beach so it felt less congested than the other hotels we saw and the other benefit was its' easier access when driving. Eat breakfast at the Wailana Cafe across the street...$4.99 breakfast w/ all the pancakes you can eat along w/ wonderful waitresses! Do the hike to the summit of Diamond Head early in the day, the view is awesome and it's an easy 25 - 30 minutes for all but the most out of shape. Go to Ala Moana shopping center (which can be walked to) to see everything under the sun. We did the Royal Hawaiian Luau and found it significantly less impressive than the Old Lahaina Luau we went to on Maui a few days later...I'd pass on it. Pearl Harbor: we got there at 7:45 sunday morning and waited for 1 1/2 hours! Get there closer to 7:00 and you'll get right in. Did the Navatek dinner cruise and that's well worthwhile as you go out past Diamond Head for a two hour ride. I highly recommend the Hilton and will go there on our next trip!

<Content>Very nice hotel My wife and daughter recently spent 2 nights at this Hilton. We stayed based on comments from Trip Advisor. It was very nice, but also very large and very busy. This was a bit of culture shock after staying on Kauai for a week in a condo. Despite it's size they are very organized. Our room was immaculate. The maid service was adequate. I agree with others about the expense of eating in and around the hotel area. We did have a very nice and inexpensive meal at the Noodle House in the village and the pizza at the Round Table was very good and not overly priced. The beach and and pool areas were very nice, but also very crowded. We also saw the fireworks from the beach on July 4th and they were excellent. One thing I would do different in the future is not to arrive until at least 3 PM because it is very unlikely you will be able to check into your room prior to 3 PM. Overall the hotel was excellent and there is certainly a lot to do in the area.

<Content>What a lovely place My husband and I arrived feeling somewhat jaded from Brisbane and had to queue for quite some time to check in to the hotel. We spent 3 nights in the HHV from 11 to 14 June 2005 and stayed in the Tapa Tower. Our room was very good indeed, spotless and comfortable. It was also very quiet and no sign of screaming children. The gardens were absolutely lovely and we were just happy to be able to relax there before moving on to our next destination in the US. Yes, there are expensive boutiques and restaurants but there are other reasonable places too. We thought the runner holding a flaming torch and lighting the streetlights very effective - we admired his stamina! All in all, we had a very relaxing time and would quite definitely return to the HHV and specifically the Tapa Tower.

<Content>AWESOME!AWESOME!AWESOME! We stayed here for our honeymoon. We were totally impressed. The grounds are BEAUTIFUL! Parrots, ducks, pengiuns, fish all around. Right on the beach. We had awesome views of the ocean and Diamond Head from our room. And the super pool was nice.We stayed in the Rainbow tower. We highly recommend this place. This resort has everything you'll ever need. Really there is no reason to leave this paradise and venture out into the people packed streets. They had great stores to shop in. I am a shopper! The only thing we didn't like was the Chinese restuarant on premise.Highly recommend this resort!!

<Content>Wonderful view For our first time in Hawaii, we think that this was a good place to stay. It truly is a beautiful village, with lots of shops, restaurants of all prices, and a magnificient view of Diamond Head and the beach. The grounds are the best part of the entire property. The rooms were standard and comfortable, ok but not squeaky clean. If you are looking for a quiet get-a-away, this would not be the place to choose. Every area was packed and there were lines to get in pools, restaurants, and elevators. Because we got a great deal (Priceline), we feel like this was a good place to stay. P.S. (Be warned--- they charge for the little coffee packets and tea bags!)

<Content>Great resort in paradise! Stayed here for 9 nights, including July 4th, and had a fantastic stay. The fireworks show was perhaps the best we'd ever seen, and we viewed it from the comfort of our room! Our package deal included a 'garden view' room but upon arrival, we had been magically upgraded to an ocean view room. It was in the Kalia tower, which is kind of new. It is the farthest one back from the beach, but it still had a great view of the water. It was a comfortable room and included a little refrigerator (in addition to a mini bar) so all the drinks I bought at ABC had a cool home. The grounds are beautiful to see, as there are planters, flower beds, koi ponds, penguins, parrots, and plenty flora and fauna that are entertaining. There are lots of stores, though most are jewelry and touristy-souvenir types. There are several restaurants, and none is particularly budget-friendly, but all we tried were tasty. One bad experience was at the Golden Dragon. We have been to the one at the Vegas Hilton and it was a great experience, but this one, with one bad waiter, ruined the meal. He had to argue with my husband about how and what he wanted to order and rushed us because the kitchen was closing. We got the manager and a new waiter, then all was well. Having shuttle pickup outside the Tapa tower was very convenient. We had a car and used the parking garage too, but traffic can be terrible at times and we didn't know where we were going so shuttles to the luau and dinner cruise were welcome.We also took a shuttle to Hilo Hattie, which is an awesome store for Hawaiian clothing and gifts, but the Hilton was the first stop so we got to go all through town to pick up other people. It made me appreciate the Hilton, because once you get into 'hotel row' it is so crowded with walking tourists (who don't know what the red hand-don't walk sign means) it is very hard to drive through. The Hilton is more isolated, although there are plenty things in walking distance too. Cabs are handy to get you to the crowded places without having to fight for parking. Many of the cabs are Town Cars, which are very nice! The giant Ala Moana mall is pretty close too, and it is pretty easy to get a shuttle to or from there. There is a huge food court, and lots of high-end stores. The Super Pool was not as cool in person as in pictures, and always had a crowd, but was pretty and well-serviced. We very much enjoyed our stay here and definitely would choose it again and recommend it.

<Content>Would not return I really don't understand why people love this place. We just spend 6 nights there using our Hilton Honors points and would not return. There were some good things and I'll list those first. I asked for a view when checking in and we had a beautiful view of the water and Honolulu. We were in the Tapa Tower on the 32nd floor. The room itself was nice and clean. The food choices were many and there were some reasonable prices. The Round Table pizza and CJ's Deli were pretty inexpensive (at least for Hawaii). You're within walking distance of many shops and restaurants on the property and in Waikiki. My husband is in a wheelchair and everything was very accessible for him.Now for the bad: Our bathroom was horrendus. It smelled like mold/mildew and the fixtures were out dated. The closet for the refrigerator and pantry was less than clean. We had horrible housekeeping service. Our maid insisted on leaving only 2 towels every day even though there were 3 of us in the room and we had to request additional towels constantly. We needed more cream and sugar packets for our one free pot of coffee each day and she said she could not leave them, that we had to request them through the mini-bar. Our room was not cleaned until after 3 each day even though we were out of the room by 9:00 every morning. We kept having maintenance workers knocking on our door, once to change all the light bulbs, once to check the locks and once to check the minibar. They said they were doing it all thru the hotel. But I would think they could wait until a slow period or do it when the rooms are empty. The pools are extremely small and you have to line up in the morning to get a chair. Waikiki is nice and we are glad we went there once, but probably won't return. It is a major city, after all and not as slow-paced and friendly as the other islands. We also spent 6 nights on the Big Island using our HH points at the Waikola Village Hilton and we much preferred that Hilton.

<Content>Loved the Hilton Our group of 8 ladies stayed in the Rainbow Tower of the Hilton Hawaiian Village from June 23 to June 29, 2005. We had 2 rooms, one on the 9th floor and the other on the 12th floor. It was the first trip for 5 of us and the 2nd for 3. Both rooms had terrific views and wre very nice and clean. They were a little small, but really, how much time do you spend in the room? The Lanai was great, we went out every am and pm to see the night view. I was very pleased with the service, the food was good, I would highly recommend the Round Table Pizza and the New York Deli if you are on a budget, the prices were not bad, we ate there several times, at night we went off the grounds, Dukes was great, as was Cheesburger of Wakkaki. It is just down the road. We didn't even try the higher price eating establishments on the grounds. The beach was very nice, the pool was good, but get out early to get a chair, because it is like a stampede at 8:30. We planned our trip last October through a nice travel agent Nick Monroe through The Vistor Center. He set up our flights with Delta, the hotel accomodations and transfers. He was great. He gave me alot of good tips. I would recommend him highly!! Oh, we took 2 tours, the trip to Pearl Harbour and then on around the Island, Dole Plantation, Macadamia Nut farm, several lookouts, it was great and the next day a Nature Island Tour, saw a waterfall, several points of interest. It was good, not fabulous but worthwhile, had a great guide, he was a Hawaiian studies student, so was very well informed. We also went to the Paradise Cove Luau. It was not that great, but I hear most of them are not really fabulous. The meal was awful. Well, that is about all I have to say, I would highly recommend the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It is the best for your buck, in my opinion. Gor for it!

<Content>Absolutely beautiful Went to Hawaii in May 2005 for a vacation with my boyfriend and return engaged! We stayed at various bbs and then treated ourselves at the end of the trip to 3 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki. What an amazing resort- it is truly a mini village with several stores, restaurants, a fabulous Ice Cream store (highly recommended), it's own mini-aquarium (swans, fish, penguins and other native birds) and most importantly- the beach! The hotel is at the end of the main strip so it is much quieter than can be at some of the other hotels. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The rooms are great. We stayed in the Tapa Tower on the 16th floor which gave us a partial ocean view. The room was quite spacious for the price. Mai Tais are pretty good at the Tropics Bar by the beach entrance. Lots of tour buses come to the hotel to pick up guests who have booked seats for things such as Luaus (Germaines or Paradise Cove) and other tours. This is a nice convenience rather than having to walk somewhere else to pick up the bus. Also there are fireworks by the beac every Friday night at 8pm that the Hilton provides. We watched from an amazing hotel called Sorrentos which is at the top of the Iliakai hotel which neighbors the Hilton. This restaurant is excellent- with great views of the beach and ocean, great service and great food. Pricing is in the $20s for main entrees so it definitely a good spot for a nice evening out. The Hilton is a wonderful place to stay if you want to treat yourself to a nice hotel in Waikiki. Can't wait to go back!

<Content>Nice Family Vacation We just returned from a 10 day vacation to the island of Oahu and Hawaii. They couldn't be more different! Oahu is all hustle and bustle, while Hawaii is definately more laid back. This was our 3 kids' (ages 16, 15  9) first time to the islands, so we wanted to be sure that they saw all the important sites on Oahu. We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village (HHV)- plenty of action. Be sure to sign up for the Hilton Awards program as they will upgrade you if they have the rooms. We were upgraded to an oceanview room at the Rainbow Tower which is the tower closest to the beach. The hotel was very nice, lots to do and great free entertainment during the evenings. Plus, the shopping lasts until 10 or 11 pm. The ABC Store is great for water, snacks and those fantastic chocolate covered macadamia nuts. And their prices are great. The HHV's grounds are gorgeous! But like others before me have said...you do pay for everything. Only the beach towels were no charge. You do pay for parking ($13 a day), umbrellas and lounge chairs. Since our kids were always in the water, we opted for the beach towels. The Friday night Prince's show was great. It costs $12 per adult (it does include one drink - great virgin pina coladas) to sit poolside, but it was worth it! The entertainment included hula dancing, fire eating and plenty of music. Plus, my 9 year old was able to be in the Keiki parade. Also, there are several gratis activities for guests - my daughters took hula lessons and there were several others that they could have taken (lei making, water aerobics, garden tours etc.) had we not be sight seeing. For a great breakfast, eat at the Wailani Coffee House across from the Hilton. Great prices, very good coffee, excellent Portuguese French toast and the nicest waitresses. All the Hilton restaurants are a little pricey. We did eat at the Golden Dragon which had fantastic service, pretty good food, but dinner for 5 cost about $115 without drinks. They even charge for steamed rice. As for sightseeing, we saw Pearl Harbor (get there early, as we had to wait 2 1/2 hrs for the boat ride over and we went at 10:45 am), the Punchbowl National Cemetary, the Dole Pineapple Plantation, Huanama Bay for snorkling (take your own gear), hiked Diamond Head, did the North Shore drive - eat at Ted's Bakery for the BEST burgers and homemade fries - all for $4! Also visited U of Hawaii (not the exotic local that my 16 was expecting! - cross that off our list) and ate fantastic malasadas at Leonards. We also had beach time. Lots to do in Oahu. We used the next island of Hawaii just to unwind and relax. We definately enjoyed our time. If we go back again with our kids, we'll just go to the big island, but for their first experience, Oahu can't be beat!

<Content>Lots to see and do at the Hilton Just returned from 6 nights at HHV. Overall the hotel and staff were great. We had the opportunity to see rooms in three different towers (Kalia, Rainbow, and Ali'i Towers) and all rooms were very nice. My fianc茅e and I stayed in the Ali'i Tower and really enjoyed the gym, private pool, and complimentary hors d'oeuvres every afternoon. Staff at the Ali鈥檌 tower was very helpful and accommodating. The Rainbow Tower appeared to have the best views but rooms were a littler smaller. Kalia Tower was the newest tower and the carpet and furnishing were in excellent condition. Food on the hotel grounds is expensive, but not more than you would expect at any tourist location. More reasonably priced food is available off the grounds but is still higher than mainland prices for most restaurant chains. If you have the time, consider listening to the Hilton Grand Vacations Promotion offer. It is only about 1 1/2 hours long and you will receive $100.00 in gift certificates that can be used on property. Certificates are good at nice restaurants such as Bali By the Sea and Benihana. Dinner at the Bali was very nice but if you want a table with a nice view make reservations a few days in advance. We watched the fireworks and Kings Jubilee from our hotel room balcony and I honestly believe the view was better than around the pool plus and you save the money it costs to sit poolside. Super pool was large, but not enough chairs to accommodate everyone who wanted to use it. Pool opens at 8:30 am and there was usually a line to get in. Chairs fill up in about half an hour and people often reserve them with towels for use later in the day. The Ali'i tower has its own pool that we never had a problem getting a chair by. Beach is very nice, not overly crowded and lots of activities. Overall, hotel and staff was excellent. Hotel room was very clean. We had problems with our hot water but they were immediately addressed by maintenance. Maid service was always prompt with any requests. We would certainly consider staying there on our next trip.

<Content>Amazing! Spectacular! We had our wedding weekend at the HHV. It was amazing. Crowds of people clapped as we walked through the hotel. Staff and Guests all wished us well. What a warm, friendly, clean and beautiful resort - the best of the best! All my guest loved it. My husband and I stayed at the Rainbow Tower on the 3rd floor in a corner oceanfront suite, the views are spectacular. My in laws were on the 30th floor in the Ali Tower with incredible views. Other guests in Ali loved their rooms, both partial oceanview and garden.Service was outstanding. Brought up your luggage, sales manager coordinated rooms and the Mandara Spa was incredible with good prices. The facial was my favorite. The grounds are so picture perfect - no one believed me when I said there are penguins there! If you need a photographer, our was awesome www.tanega.net Jayson was fun and took excellent pictures of us at the hotel. Platinum Limosuines ---- were great! The florist at the hotel is also a godsend after we made the misktake of ordering flowers online.Reviews will say the hotel is too big - it has great shops, relaxing and everything you would need. Even a post office in a business center to ship your things home.

<Content>Great Hotel Just came back from 7 nights with 20 family members. The hotel is awesome with nice views and probably the best on beach hotel on Waikiki. I stayed in the Kalia Tower and was very nice. If get assigned to this tower ask to be placed on the executive floors (22-24). You get continental breakfast and snacks. This hotel is very expensive to eat at. Most people would go outside of the hotel. There is a breakfast cafe across the street Wailena Cafe very reasonable (Denny's) type of cafe. The only complaint I have with the hotel is that the staff aren't very helpful. But if I go back to Oahu I will have to stay there again. I checked out all the hotel's that suppose to have beach on Waikiki and can't compare to the Hilton Hawaiian Village.

<Content>Great value The Hilton Hawaiian Village is a great resort style hotel with all ammenities on the hotel's property. I paid $209/night in June which is very reasonable compared to other comparable hotels. The property offers over 25 different food options, but they are expensive and you can do better walking down the street to some of the local restaurants. The gym is $15/day and doesn't offer anything more than your typical hotel gym. The hotel staff are very hospitable and cater to the tourists. The Hilton Hawaiian Village is definately a treat!

<Content>Best Hotel on Waikiki Beach!! This is my second stay at this hotel. The service is wonderful and they have the nicest, cleanest and widest beach. They try their best to accommodate all guests' requests in spite of being one of the busiest hotels in the area! A wide choice of restaurants and shops. If you have the $$, would definitely recommend it. There's no other hotel like the HHV on Waikiki Beach!

<Content>Just perfect ! Aloha!Just returned from our Hawaii trip including 3 nights at the HHV.If you are planning to stay in the Waikiki area, this is definitely the best choice:The best and biggest beach in Waikiki, 22 restaurants, countless shops, perfect grounds, clean rooms, friendly staff, nightly entertainment including a free Hawaiian Hula show and torch lightning ceremony, etc.Central Waikini area is in walking distance (5-10 minutes), however you don麓t need to leave the resort as there is so much to see and do.Take an Ocean Front room high up in the Rainbow tower and you will get the ultimate view over Waikiki Beach - it still gives me the creeps.This is just perfect !!!

<Content>HHV is fantastic for Waikiki Just back from family vacation to HHV. This site helped me make my choice so I'll share to benefit others. Went for 10 days with 2 small kids(2,4). Have stayed in Maui Wailea area x 3. Was apprehensive about Waikiki being a city on a beach but HHV gave me that Hawaiian experience I was hoping for. Different but comparable to Wailea.Stayed in Alii tower. Upgraded to partial ocean from garden view. Room was upscale with plasma tv. This tower costs more but with extra amenities as others have said. In particular... private pool(but often crowded with business types and not as family friendly as rest of resort)...evening appetizers(quite extensive and all you can eat)...outstanding maid service. To correct an earlier review, you can get a crib (pack and play) at the Ali'i tower. Best part was its central on-beach location.The resort is huge, meaning you never have to leave it. It's that nice. We stayed for 10 days and only left it for 1 afternoon. Tons to do.The beach is the best on Waikiki. Snorkel right from beach and see same fish as when you dive or go on Atlantis sub. Great surfing also(locals use it). Very wide beach with calm waters, great for kids and swimmers. The pools are nice but not fantastic. The grounds are fantastic. The nightly hoola shows are nice (fantastic if you're a little girl). The food has great variety and is of resort quality and price.In sum, it's great, it's big. better for families and conventions than honeymooners (though we saw plenty)

<Content>Ali Tower is Fabulous!!! The Hilton Hawaiian Village Ali Tower is perfection to an extreme. We have stayed all over the world and this was one of our most delightful trips. We will be back. :) We lacked for nothing. The maid service was the best I have ever experienced! They were far superior to Loews, Westin, Sheraton or Marriott maids. Also, the breakfast buffets are just immense and the staff is so courteous! Thank you! This is what we paid for and it was worth every cent!Everyone treated us like royalty anywhere we went on the grounds. The food was great and the grounds are breath takingly beautiful. We really enjoyed the entertainment, shopping, and beach as well. Go here if you want to enjoy your vacation. Incredible!!!!!! Thank you Hilton.

<Content>Ali'i Tower is The Best ! My Husband and I have been to Hawaii several times and have even stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village but never in the Ali'i Tower. I must say that it was one of the best experiences we have ever had! We somehow got upgraded to a large corner room on the 8th floor, we took our 2 kids this time and were a little concerned that the room might be crowded. It was not crowded in the least. We had a roll away bed for our older son and our younger son slept on the pull-out sofa. The views were magnificent and the corner lanai balcony was perfect. The grounds are very luxurious and beautiful. The beach was awesome! We were there for 5 days and then left for Maui. Even thought we stayded in a large suite in Maui, it did not compare to our stay at the Ali'i Tower. We already have plans to return. Try the Ali'i Tower at the Hilton Hawaiiam Village, you will Love it.

<Content>Our favorite hotel in Waikiki My husband and I stayed at the HHV for 5 nights in March 2005. We were a bit skeptical because of the size of the resort and the fact that we were staying in the midst of March break. However, we had nothing to worry about. Even though the resort was filled to capacity, it did not feel crowded. We stayed in an ocean view room in the Alii Tower. We were glad we booked this tower. We enjoyed the private pool and had no problem getting a beach chair by the pool. The resort's main pool looked to be quite crowded. We also liked the location of the resort. It's a nice distance from the main Waikiki area (10 minute walk). We also liked the village feel of the resort. We're already planning to return next year.

<Content>Great vacation resort! I've stayed here many times and it is one of my favorites in Waikiki. Pricey but you get what you pay for! The grounds are beautiful - it's a city within a city - you really never have to leave the resort! Some of the rooms need a little work, but overall they're nice. Tapa Tower and Kalia Tower are my favorites - I've also stayed in the Diamond Head tower and it seemed a little run down compared to the others. Lots of shops and restaurants to choose from and the staff is very nice and accomodating. Great for families with kids too!

<Content>I guess April is the time to go... Me  my husband just got back from 7 nights in the Rainbow Tower. We had an Ocean Front room on the 20th floor. Wow! What a view! If you're there on a Friday night, make sure you go back up to your room about 15 minutes before the Polynesian Show is over. The fireworks display for the finale are literally exploding in front of your face on the balcony. The absolute highlight of our stay. You'll never have a chance to be so close to fireworks!We bought our coffee and cream from a local market, not the ABC, and made it through the week for about $10.00 on coffee, as opposed to @ $30 if we made their in room stuff...we love our coffee.Yes, the beach umbrella/lounge set is $50.00 a day. We did this one day toward the end of our stay when we were too tired to drive. We thought it was great. You can stay on the beach all day without getting too sunburned, belly up to the bar for a MaiTai at will, and cuddle under your umbrella untill the occasional rain passes.The other days we spent driving to different beaches around the Island. Just beautiful. We must have come at the right time, because it was not crowded by any means.(April 23-May 1st.)Food on site was average at best and expensive. We tried to eat while we were out and about. Our absolute favorite meal was at Kobe Japanese Steak House, right behind the parking structure on Ala Moana. It's prepared benehana style at your table, which made us nervous, but the Rib Eye was probably the best we ever had!Overall, the grounds were gorgeous, the shops quaint and the people friendly. No trouble at check in. No lines. We asked for a late check out and they gave us 'till 5pm for free.It's a grand resort on a grand scale. A great place to have it all close at hand, while being able to get away from it all by day.If you're a smoker, this is a non-smoking facilty. You can smoke on your balcony and at the 2 designated bars. Other than that you have to go out to the beach. Please remember to put your butts in the trash. Always, anywhere you go!Aloha, and I hope this was of some help.

<Content>6Days in Paradise My Husband and I just came back from HHV after staying for 6days/5ngts. We check-in on 4/26/05 and were given a room in the Rainbow Tower on the 11th Floor. The room was decent size with a small (nothing special) bathroom. Our room overlooked the pool, Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head. We enjoyed watching the nightly entertainment at the pool from our balcony. We rented a room for our entire stay but found that it wasn't worth it. We had to pay $13 daily for self-parking which wasn't easy to access from the hotel and there is traffic, traffic and did I say traffic everywhere. It took us 1 hour one night to find parking near the International Market. We learned our lesson and walked 20 minutes the next day. They were having a festival called Spam Jam that Saturday evening on that Strip (outside the Royal Hawaiian) where there was music and food stands. We didn't get to go on any tours since our trip was too short. We did eat buffet breakfast every morning at the Rainbow Lanai. The selection is eggs made to order or already made, bacon, sausage, corn beef hash, hash pototoes, miso salmon, macadamia nut pancakes, salad bar, breads, and fruits. The food was good but how much can u eat in the morning. The pool opened at 8:30 every morning which is late considering we had breakfast at 6:30. You do need to be there early for get a chair since some people reserve the chairs and then go eat breakfast which I thought was rude. There is not enough of pool chairs to accomodate all the people that stay in the 5 towers that Hilton has. Be prepare to pay $53 for renting 2 beach chairs and 1 umbrella daily, which was upsetting. We went to the ABC Stores and bought the beach mats for $2 each. The Ala Moana Shopping Mall is where u can find many designer stores (Chanel, Prada, Dior, Hermes, and LV. There are 3 floors of shops and also a big food court which we ate at many times. The Waikele Outlet is about 45 minutes away with traffic which you'll find Guess, Calvin Klein, Barneys New York, Tommy, Saks, and Banana Republic. There was so much more we wanted to do here but was out of time. We vow that we will be back if not this year then next year.

<Content>Paradise on earth! Check-in was easy. I was upgraded at no extra cost to the best tower in the resort, the Ail'i. The room was wonderful and had all the amenities, including free coffees, teas and spring water, refreshed daily. I guarantee you will never sleep in a more comfy bed. 5 pillows and the sheet WAS a pillow. The private terrace for the tower guests had a hot tub, pool, bar and complimentary hor' dourves at 5. My lanai or patio had a view of the beach (the legendary Waikiki beach that is) and a pretty park full of palm trees. They have some kind of Hawaiian activity at the super pool almost everynight, like hula dancers, but watch for the fireworks show on Friday night! The only thing I disliked were all the small kids, try not to step on them. The room service is prompt, but the food was terrible. It's a wonderful village of great restaurants and shops to appeal to any taste, so who needs room service food anyway. Maid service was fine, cleaned and refreshed everything.The Amex tour desk clerks were friendly and very helpful. I took a nice tour of the island. The mini bus stopped at other hotels to pick up passengers and that's when I realized I picked one of the best places to stay. I saw almost EVERYTHING worth taking a picture of on the tour. I got off the little bus and passed a couple of hundred people waiting in line, no kidding, to take a mega bus on a 45 minute trip to an over rated Luau. Also went on a cool little submarine ride, which has a shuttle boat take you zipping off the private dock right there at the resort. You end up getting a free cruise to Diamond Head in the process of meeting the sub. Great stay, great resort!

<Content>A paradise awaits you Aloha,I had the pleasure of visiting Hawaii and stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village at the Ali'i Towers for seven nights and six days. It was a memorable stay. AN experience of a life time. I enjoyed every moment of it. The ambiance, the friendliness and the continous courtesy extended to us was great.My only regret is that the stay was too short. But my goal before I depart this life is to have the opportunity to visit again and this time hopefully to visit some of the other islands.Mahalo.

<Content>Splendid Stay Although it's been now over two years since I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu, I think I can safely comment as to its general features and atmosphere.The location is a little off the beaten path, on the edge of Waikiki. This has pluses and minuses. It's about a 10-minute walk to the action of Waikiki proper. However, the location is less busy and quieter. I liked the respite this location provided while still affording the opportunity to plunge into Waikiki's nightlife on foot whenever I wanted.The hotel doesn't hurt for activities, anyway. There are plenty of shops, restaurants, and beach activities at the HHV. At dusk, a Hawaiian hula show and lighting of torches takes place. HHV is comprised of several towers, some being more opulent and costly to stay in than others. I stayed in a less opulent tower, the Rainbow, but I had a great view of Diamond Head, the beach, and the main courtyard and pool. My tower's rooms were nice and clean, albeit nothing special.Service was friendly throughout the stay. Food was great, although not top-of-the-line. Food prices were on par with what I saw elsewhere in the area.I heartily recommend the Hilton Hawaiian Village and would return there in a heartbeat.

<Content>Honeymoon at the HHV Well had a few days at the Luxor in Vegas before coming here and have to say that this hotel is GREAT !The room that we had was good although the view of the beach involved having to lean out and look right the view of the pool area below was nice. The room was good - kept tidy and had no complaints except one - other guests had the habit of banging the room doors. This was a major problem as it was disturbing - other than that the resort was great. Service was without fault.Tips it is an expensive hotel to stay at if you eat on site $45 for two people to have breakfast is a huge difference to what we had in Vegas, so found that there was a good 24hr cafe across the road from the hotel that served great fare and then if you went west or east of the hotel you would find plenty of other eateries.Would I recommend this hotel to others - yes I would as it is really well laid out and the attention to detail is there. The gardens well kept and lots of wild life around the complex.Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the people were very efficient and friendly.Gavin

<Content>Quite enjoyable My wife and I spent three nights at the Hawaiian Hilton. Our check in was fast and easy. We stayed on the 29th floor (2903) of the Rainbow Tower. The views from our balcony were fantastic The bed was the most comfortable one I have ever slept in.. We found the grounds to be well maintained and the shops to be quite enjoyable. The pool was nice but quite overcrowded. At about 3:00 the pool started to empty out. Our first night we ate at Tropics. It was fine for sandwiches. Night#2 we ate at the Golden Dragon. This place has ruined me forever. I can no longer eat local Chinese food. Their food was fantastic and the views were great.. On top of that the service was impeccable. Day #3 we ate at Bali by the Sea. It was just as good as the Golden Dragon. The service was even better at Bali.All in all I would give the Hilton high marks all the way across. On a scale of 1 to10. 1 being the Swamp Fox Inn in Columbia, SC and 10 being The Greenbrier in White Sulfur Springs WV, I would give the Hilton a 9.Mark

<Content>Very nice Very brief review. Stayed at the Hilton for 7 nights, arriving late on April 16th. Checked in the Kalia Towers without any problems. Our Garden View room was perfect. My 2 kids had a problem with the sofa so I called room service requesting 2 roll-aways. They arrived in 10 minutes. Problem solved.Only used the pool for 2 of the 7 days. Too crowded and couldn't find any chairs. We had a rent a car and explored other beaches around Oahu.Only had one meal at the Japanese restaurant. $120.00 for the 4 of us. I read the boards and was aware of the high food prices, so that was the only meal on the grounds. Buy your snacks and water at the ABC store.Overall a very nice stay at the Hilton. Will probably return again next year.

<Content>Perfect for families We stayed eight nights at the Ali'i Tower and were very pleased. I have been to Hawaii before and would recommend seeing another island (Maui is wonderful) but since we had our 9-year-old twins with us, we decided to spend our entire trip on Oahu. The hotel property is lovely--and I'm very fussy. The rooms in the Ali'i Tower are very comfortable and worth the extra cost in order to avoid extra charges for coffee, etc. The separate check in desk is great too. The lines at the desk in the motor lobby are ALWAYS long. As soon as you arrive, have the parking valet point you in the direction of the Ali'i Tower. Hint: Request a corner room if possible. They have two balconies--one facing the ocean, one facing Diamond Head. Gorgeous. The beds are very comfortable, but if you need two, they're only full size. (My husband is 6'3 and he was a bit annoyed.)We had looked forward to the Super Pool from the photos on the website--but it's not as large as it looks. We spent all our pool time at the Ali'i pool which was never crowded.We ate our first breakfast at the Rainbow Lanai--over $50 and the kids were free! It's worth the 5-minute walk to Wailana, a little restaurant just outside of the property. Very reasonable and the food was good--similar to a Denny's.We did eat at Bali by the Sea one night and both the service and food were excellent. Make reservations--it's popular. In fact, we were surprised to be seated two tables from a very well-known television personality. All in all, we really enjoyed the property. Be sure to sign up as a Hilton Honors member before you go. Your points add up fast since you'll spend a fortune and you can double dip and get additional frequent flyer miles. Also, if your flight leaves later in the day (as ours did) you can get a late check out (as late as 5 p.m. if you're a HH member.) Keep in mind, this is only if the property is not booked solid. If it is, they will only extend your check out by one hour--believe me, I begged. However, you may request the use of a hospitality suite--they'll allow you 20 minutes for each member of your party. You may only sign up for this on the day you're checking out. DO IT FIRST THING IN THE A.M. They get booked very quickly.

<Content>nice but sorta a rip off too The room wasn't exactly what we expected location wise...it was about two block from the beach...as the crow flies.....the room itself was comfortable, nicely appointed etc.....But the really frustrating thing is the way this hotel nickel dimes you to death.....you want hi-speed interent......oh sure, about 12 dollars a day---you want a wi-fi connection (wireless available in certain locations) a password available about 12 bucks per day-----We spent 8 days in the same room, and we could only get 10 little bags of coffee for our coffee maker---I had to cry to get those.....instead of the 3 per day, if you checked in lets say everyday into a new room...we got a total of the 10 personal size bags of coffee...then the hotel had the nerve to charge on my card---$19.00 because they said I exceeded my coffee allotment.....(these are the little coffee servings for the 4 cup machines)...This stuff was petty and annoying.....and like other people have said...the food available either thru room service or restaurants on the grounds was very expensive.......like a bagel for $3.50 at a snack bar etc...you want to do pay per view?...rent a movie....try $12.00 for a movie...... Well I found this stuff so aggraving it pretty well made me know where I wouldn't stay next time......not the Hilton Village...

<Content>A brief but very nice stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Our family (Mom, Dad, Son 11, Daughter 4) stayed for 2 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu on Waikiki after a five night stay in Kona on the Big Island. I booked through Expedia and paid $209 per night for a garden view room. When we got there we were upgraded to a garden view room in the Alii tower which is the concierge tower. (Thanks Hilton!) The Alii tower has a pool and deck area that is exclusively for the use of the guests in this tower, with a continental breakfast and other fare available during the day. I also spoke with the Alii tower concierge a few times and they were extremely helpful. If I were to stay at this property again I would definitely pay to upgrade to this tower. The only meal we took at the HHV was the breakfast buffet at the Rainbow Lanai. We had to wait about thirty minutes to get in. It was not the most exciting buffet and the price was a little steep, as all food on the island was. The HHV was a nice change of pace from the very low-key and remote feeling of the resort we stayed at in Kona. Waikiki beach is really fantastic and the kids really enjoyed it. I would definitely stay there again!

<Content>OK but does not compare to the real Hawaii I have stayed here three times. First time was personal; next two for business where others chose the hotel. Impartial staff. Crowded grounds. Overly crowded pool and beach. Our Deluxe Ocean View room in the Rainbow Tower had a view of a building and a part of the lagood. Turns out you need an Ocean Front view to actually see the ocean. True, we could see the ocean if we stood on our lanai and leaned out to look around the building. We have visited Hawaii over 15 times and stayed at over 20 properties (we LOVE Hawaii). Waikiki just isn't our thing compared to the secluded beaches, spacious gounds, uncrowded resorts, and truly friendly Aloha spirit we have experienced everywhere else in Hawaii. I will stay at this hotel again in August because of a convention there and I look forward to it. But, we would never stay at this hotel again for a personal trip. The staff attitude would fit that found in typical Hiltons in big cities. The HHV is good but not the paradise I think of when I think Hawaii. If you have not yet been to Hawaii, don't stay here! If you want to see Pearl Harbor, the North Shore, and get a look at Waikiki Beach spend a couple of days somewhere on the Beach. But, if you want to experience paradise, go to a different island or at least stay on the North shore.

<Content>Good for Waikiki This is the third time we have stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in the last 6 years. We have now stayed twice in the Diamond Tower and once in the Hilton Grand Vacations Club tower (whatever that's called!). We stayed for 7 nights this visit (April 2005).It was by far the most crowded stay we have had there. There were several conventions going on. It's true that you actually stand in line at 8:15am in the morning at the pool until they undo the ropes and let you go get your lounge chair. It sounds silly, but if you want a chair for the day, that's what you have to do. We never had to do that during our previous trips. We usually went to dinner early so we could get in and out quickly with our 2 1/2 year old. We ate at the Rainbow Lanai - great buffet - and had several lunches at Tropix - ok food, high prices, but VERY convienient. We like to walk down the beach to the Shorebird for breakfast and dinner (in another beachfront hotel). Way better prices for the type of same food.We decided to go back to this Hilton because I had Hilton Hhonors points to pay for our stay. We always enjoy Hawaii, but I can't say Oahu is our favorite island. Maui seems much cleaner, prettier, and laid back. However, for Waikiki, it is the best resort we have seen. We've walked through many of the other beachfront hotels, and nothing compares. The grounds are so large and nice, it's fun just to walk around the place in the evening. Hilton is not in the heart of Waikiki, but is definitely in walking distance of all the shopping and restaurants of Waikiki. The evening entertainment at the Hawaiian Village is great and we were out sitting on the beach with our 2 1/2 year-old every night watching fireworks, listening to music at Tropix, or watching a show by the pool.The pool doesn't have a great area for toddlers which is disappointing, but they have a kids pool that is good for 5 yrs and up. Our son had to play on the steps into the pool if he wanted to stand in the water. Don't get me wrong, we still had tons of fun. I was an early riser, so we had chairs at the pool every day. We had WONDERFULLY warm weather (85 degrees with a nice breeze), so we needed the pool.The rooms are absolutely fine, but nothing special. The beds are extra comfy!! The Hilton Grand Vacation Club rooms are much better, but those rooms are really like suites and you get a kitchen and living room as well.We will go back to Hawaii late next year I'm sure, but I think it will be a long time before we go back to Oahu. Maui and the Big Island are less commercial and we like that. If you haven't been to Oahu before, it's worth the visit, and the Hawaiian Village is a great place to stay. The facility is great, but crowded. Prices are high for services (parking, spa, rentals, etc.) and anything else you want to buy, but you can easily walk somewhere off the grounds for the same things. Aloha!

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian Playground!!! I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village during the first week of April for five days and found it to be quite disappointing. Kids were everywhere, from the time I entered the grounds until the time I exited in my rental car! Did I mention the overly crowded kid-populated pool?!???? I felt as if I was at Disney World!!! Okay...enough of the kids-talk. Let's get to the hotel itself. The grounds are absolutely beautiful with its tropical foliage, exotic birds and koi ponds. However, the rooms are just okay. The beds are nice with cozy and comfortable pillows but the room is extremely small. I stayed in an oceanfront room in the Rainbow tower on the 29th floor. The view was nice as I awoke each morning to blue and aqua waters but I would recommend a lower floor. When I requested a lower floor, the concierge informed me that no rooms were available except for those in the Ali'l Tower for $600!!! I declined being that I was already paying $300 for the one I had already requested. Speaking of the room...on the second night, I heard a rattling noise outside my door as if someone was trying to break in but I figured that was impossible and perhaps, someone was fiddling with the lock of someone's room next door. Boy, was I wrong!!! About three hours later while I was asleep, two men from security burst into my room!!! They had been trying to repair a lock but were at the wrong door--mine!!! They apologized and the next morning, sent a care basket to the room with fresh pineapple, coffee and water. It was a nice gesture but imagine if I had been in the room doing other things!!! Aside from that catastrophe, the food was nothing spectacular. I ate at Bali by the Sea which was your typical glitzed-up, showpiece seafood. DO NOT order room service. It is expensive and everything tastes nuked!!! I ate at the breakfast buffet three times but I would hardly call it a buffet. It only featured a few meats, pancakes, french toast, potatoes, eggs and a small portion of fruits and pastries. It was definitely nothing like the Vegas-style buffets I'm accustomed to. A highlight of the hotel is that it has representatives on sight ready to book your travel exursions. I found this to be very convenient. While there, I experienced the Atlantis Submarine (ok but nothing to brag about), Pearl Harbor (go early in the morning to beat the crowds), an Atlantis dinner cruise (pretty good, great entertainment), Dole Pineapple Farm (educational), the Honolulu Zoo (very large with an array of animals), the Honolulu Aquarium (where's the rest of it?) and the best exursion of all..a day trip to Maui. It was definitely the highlight of my trip. It costs $300 but it was worth it as I got to visit a rainforest, dormant volcano and the lovely oceanfront of Maui. If it hadn't been for the trip to Maui my vacation would have been a complete waste of $5000!!! Actually, my friend and I had attempted to leave Honolulu after only three days and head to Vegas but after contacting Delta, the reservationist informed me that our only escape would have been to travel to Salt Lake City, remain there in a layover for three hours and then arrive in Vegas the following morning. We opted out and went to Maui on the fourth day instead. I have no desire to go back to Honolulu anytime in the near future. Hence, if a traveler is seeking blue waters for a vacation spot, head for commercialized South Beach which is a lot like Honolulu but far less expensive!!! If you want a more serene, calmer atmosphere, go to Maui, trust me!!!

<Content>great time My family and i stayed in the ali tower in march/05. I have always used this service when planning trips and found it very helpful so decided to write in. The hilton was just as most people described it - very large- very expensive - not good restaurants but with those things in mind we chose the hilton and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our room was very clean and quiet and we enjoyed the ali tower pool. The small gym by the pool was adequate although our daughter used the larger gym (cost of $14.00) at another tower and liked it alot better. We ate breakfast at the 24 hour restaurant across the street - i forget the name but you can't miss it .We tried to have a light breakfast at the hilton one morning but after waiting 30 minutes and still not waited on we left. We did get take out pizza one night as our daughter was not well and it was good. We enjoyed all the shops and the penguins and found it to be a nice break away from the even busier wakiki area. We went to pearl harbour one day and that was well worth the trip our 16 year old even enjoyed it. My husband took the city bus around the island for $2.00 one day while we went the mall and although he did not get out anywhere he said it was worth the trip. We went to the paradise cove and luau and were extremely disappointed. We ran into a traffic jam on the way and our bus was over an hour late which of course was unavoidable so we missed seeing most of the displays however it was so jammed packed you really couldn't do much anyway. We basically arrived stood in line for about 45 minutes to get a drink by then it was almost time to eat. The food was terrible and we are not fussy eaters the show was ok - at over $100.00 per ticket i guess i expected something more. We thought the hilton was well worth the price and would go again.

<Content>Loved the Hilton Hawaii Village We had just returned from a week at the Hilton Hawaii Village. The hotel is beautiful and very large. We stayed in the corner room in the Rainbow Tower. The room is small but the bed is very comfortable. The view is spectacular with 2 lanai in each corner.(this make up for the small room size) This is a very good place to watch the firework on Saturday night. Sitting on the lanai, sipping your drink and watch the firework. Aaaahhhh heavenly. This tower is in very good location. It is right next to the beach. The beach is beautiful and calm so it is good for the kids. However, it have alot of little rocks in the water so our feets hurt and it is a bit uncomfortable. I found the service was good. The staffs are friendly and informative. Everything is expensive in this hotel. But then again, I guess it is expensive in any hotel. Overall I would stay at this hotel again. Next time I will ask for an upgrade in the Ali'i Tower. I asked for an upgrade this time but the front desk person assured me that the room I have reserved have the best view which was I asked for. And she was right.

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian Village way too busy Okay, if you are trying to find a place to stay in Hawaii, and you have never been there, stop and think about what you want in a vacation.Do you want a nice, quiet, secluded beach, plenty of nature walks, and some solitude? Then don't go here! Sleeping on Waikiki is like sleeping in Grand Central Station in NYC.If you stay at this hotel, you will find that doors slam all through out the wee hours of the morning. Housekeepers try to get you out of your room at 7 AM. It's like living in a mall. The nicest feature is the beach, but nobody goes there. Everybody is in the retail shops, buying stuff imported from China and being sold as Hawaiian.Food is way expensive. Step outside the hotel grounds and you'll pay half for a better meal.Don't go here unless you have to.

<Content>A Great Family Vacation We just came back from a great family vacation at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We've stayed at many different hotels in Waikiki and I would have to say this was one was best suited for us, now that we have a two year old. She loved walking around the grounds looking at the koi and penguins and watching the Hawaiian dancing shows in the evening. Apparently, there is even a room where you can rent out toys, but we never did, as she was sufficiently entertained without them. The beach area also isn't as crowded as other hotel beaches and there are several pools to choose from. We stayed at the Ali'i Tower and requested a room on the second floor which is where the pool for Ali'i Tower guests is. Our friends and their two daughters were next door so it was very convenient for all the children to go back and forth from the pool to the rooms. If you are travelling with family or friends and you need several rooms, I recommend requesting the 2nd floor rooms which open up to the pool. In the morning you can all meet outside your rooms on the patio with your newspaper and coffee (complimentary in the Ali'i Tower) or have the complimentary appetizers every evening by the pool, just steps away. (The food wasn't fabulous but a nice service nonetheless.) You can even see the Friday night fireworks from just outside your room. We actually had to move to a different room for the last 3 days of our trip because another family had booked all of these pool-side rooms for a big family reunion. We did move to a room right above our old room which had a lovely ocean front view. The room was much brighter and if it weren't for the convenience of going back and forth to the pool with children, I would say I preferred this one over the pool level room.  As for our meals, we did go to several nice restaurants such as Alan Wong's but we had some great take out meals from the Rainbow Drive Inn and Liki Liki Drive Inn, a favourite amongst locals. We looked at several websites to read restaurant reviews and rented a car to get to them. Another restaurant I enjoyed was Hiroshi, a Japanese fusion restaurant at Restaurant Row. We also had a nice Sunday brunch at Sam Choy's. Last year, we had Sunday brunch at the Haleikulani Hotel which was one of the most beautiful brunches I've ever had, but it was booked up for this trip. As for food courts, the one at Ala Moana mall has to be one of the best I've ever seen. We also drove to Daiei, a supermarket close to the hotel.  We will definitely go back to the Hilton Hawaiian Village again for a family trip. Just a note to those who are travelling with babies - The Ali'i Tower doesn't have cribs (I don't know why they can't get one from the other towers, but I was told it was just their policy).

<Content>Not a true Aloha experience The Hawaiian Village is like a mini-city in Waikiki in Honolulu. It's exremely crowded. The grounds and beachfront are lovely, very well-kept. The room is fair, the bed is comfortable. I had a double in the Rainbow tower ocean view side. Had a slight ocean view to the left and a nice view of downtown and the mountains. It was ok but on the small side. The shower was weak.They charge for bottles of water. They charge for packets of in-room coffee. I have NEVER heard of any hotel charging $4 for in-room crappy brew-it-yourself coffee. That was just stupid. That plus the parking charge made me feel like I was being screwed.There was lots of animals on the property, ducks, koi fish, etc. Added to the scenery.This is a great place for families. Lots of kids, nice pools, very calm beaches. Lots of cute shops.Not a great place for young single people like me. With all the kids and massive crowds, I didn't feel like this was a true Hawai'ian experience. I have had a much more relaxing time at other properties on less crowded islands like Kawa'i or Maui. Oah'u (particularly Waikiki) is extremely touristy.Families should stay here, definitely. Individuals or couples looking for a romantic and private experience should look elsewhere - out of Waikiki.

<Content>Perfect Honeymoon Location We spent 8 nights of our honeymoon here from the 24th of March till the 01st of April. Idyllic is certainly Hawaii. Oahu Island was fantastic and Honolulu is a bussling city without being to overcrowded.The HHV is fantastic, we stayed in the rainbow tower, actually an upgrade as we were on honeymoon and although on the 04th floor we were delighted with the view and room. Bathroom was massive, we stored our large inflatable airbed in there every evening and my wife actually slept in there one night when I had a virus and sleeping next to me was like lying on a bed of lava.Even being ill for the last two days of our stay can dampen our enjoyment or memories of this place. Bed is fantastic, view stunning, gardens beautiful, wildlife varied and absorbing. We loved sitting in the Rainbow Lanai restaurant and eating our breakfast while watching fish swimming next to us.Yes the food is expensive, not. This a resort and on an island that has to import everything. Maybe the exchange rate is making us biased but everything was superb value. Except for one thing the Golden Dragon, good cheery service shame about the food. Expensive but tasteless. We ate across the road from at the Singha Thai restaurant, entertainment, superb food and for the quality very reasonable in our opinion.We're already planning our return, although some of the staff could do with cheering up a bit.Also we would like to say the Medical facility onsite was excellent when I became ill, they put myself at ease, (temp of 102.5), and made sure my wife and I had all the info we needed to get any medication, even phoning ahead to the Pharmacy to make sure my wife didn't have to run around and find it all herself.The Atlantis sub tour from in front of the hotel is well worth the money, but unfortunately the beach aint as good as I've experienced elsewhere, mainly due to a lot of rocks/coral just under the waters edge. Water shoes definately required. Also getting a seat by the pool is virtually impossible unless your a very early riser.Apart from that well worth the money, look forward to staying here again.

<Content>Paradise on the Beach We went to Hawaii for the first time during Easter spring break of 2005. The first impression is breath taking. The hotel is well maintained and the staff are very freandly and helpful. The rooms were very nice and the beds are very comfortable, with pillow top matt. Their is so much to do just at this hotel you would need a vacation just to cover it all. Stores galore, beautiful beach and lots of places to eat, although I suggest eating out do to the prices; unless it don't matter, the food is great. Fireworks Friday nights, Entertainment nightly by the Tapa tower and the Rainbow tower. The beach is right on the hotel property which is great if you like to spend time sunning and swimming, was a plus for our kids. The pools look nice and well kept although we never went in, why when you have the ocean at you convenience. We had a great time and are looking forward to our next visit.

<Content>Great!!!! We stayed during spring break and it was just a fantastic hotel. We were in the Rainbow tower which overlooked the ocean and had a great view of Diamond Head. The grounds were well kept and the staff was very helpful and friendly. Plenty of shops and restaurants to choose from. Get snacks etc.. at the ABC shop on the property it will save you some money. You can walk to alot of shopping areas and the bus and trolley service will take you to other spots. The rooms were just like any other Hilton...nice.

<Content>Great place to stay My wife and I recently spent 4 nights at the HHV - our first trip to Hawaii. Overall, this is a fantastic resort - It's exactly what you expect when you stay in Waikiki.First of all, for your first trip to Hawaii, Oahu is a great island - However, you need to know what you're getting in to. Honolulu/Waikiki is a CITY - No secluded beaches, no unobstructed views of nature, plenty of high-rises, plenty of people. Now, since you know that, you shouldn't be disappointed - However, the HHV is a RESORT - When you turn in from the city streets, you are essentially in a lush, tropical village at the beach. It really is beautiful with the palm trees, flowers, animals, etc. Definitely join Hilton Honors - We joined the week before and hadn't even stayed in a Hilton anytime recently, and they still upgraded our room. I think this was because we had booked a room through Expedia and they had given out all of their block of rooms by the time we got there at 10PM on a Saturday. Whatever the case, the room was great - Exactly what you'd expect (relatively new decor, nice furniture, etc.) We had a view of the water and the city/mountains. You can see either the water or the mountains from pretty much any room there, so you always feel like you're in Hawaii.The beach and the pools are exactly what you'd expect - Obviously, there are big crowds at each, but that is the same at every hotel in Waikiki (except the Hanelukani, but that is a pricey hotel geared toward older adults with no children, etc). While the beach is crowded, it's probably among the least crowded places on Waikiki per square foot (since the beach is so wide at the Hilton). For the price they charge for chairs, etc, you should just buy one at the ABC store in the village for just a few dollars more. The resort is definitely a family friendly environment, so if you don't want to see any kids, you are at the wrong place. However, I didn't see any large groups of older kids/teens unsupervised, so we really enjoyed seeing all the kids having such a good time with their families. If you are planning on bringing your own kids to Hawaii, this is a great option, not only because of the resort, but also because you can fly directly to Honolulu from many US mainland cities (making the overall travel time less).The city of Waikiki reminded me of any other touristy area of the US - Lots of high end shops and restaurants scattered among lots of markets and other cheap places. You can walk along the beach or along the street pretty much the entire 2 mile length of the city. If you want to hit the rest of Honolulu (Arizona memorial, etc), you should probably just rent a car because the taxis will run you $20 or $30 per trip each way.For restaurants, obviously the resort places are expensive - But let me tell you that everywhere in Hawaii is expensive. For instance, when we went to the suburbs of Honolulu to a local mall, we ate at a California Pizza Kitchen (typical mid-priced type place) and the individual pizzas were $12 to $18 and the soft drinks were $3 each. Once you accept the high prices in Hawaii, you just suck it up, pay it, go with the flow, and not worry about it. You didn't come here to save money, now did you? The resort restaurants are decent, but the best place we found is Duke's Canoe Club (obviously it's about as touristy as you can get). I figured that it would be average because of the fact that it's so famous and gets so much business. Not true. This place will fill you up - The food and drinks are very reasonably priced. Expect to pay about $5 a drink and between $17 and $30 per entree. The salad bar is free with entrees and could be a meal unto itself - Huge salads, rice, bread, etc. The atmosphere is exactly what you want - Loud, festive, Hawaiian. Call a day or two ahead for reservations (or earlier than that if you want to each between 6 and 8). Or you can just get a number and wait in line (at the bar, I recommend) - Usually about an hour or so. Don't miss it.Finally, I would highly recommend renting a car to see the island. The drive up to the North Shore is great - True Hawaiian, slow paced, laid back. You can see the surfers and there are some good low-priced restaurants in the small towns along the coast (Rent a convertible or a jeep. The weather doesn't get any better than this). Also, there are some really good restaurants that are more reasonably priced outside of Waikiki (Roy's is one, and there are many others). Diamond Head is a great thing to do, even for the out of shape crowd (myself included) with a great view. There is a great neighborhood at the base and east of DH with some amazing houses. If you want to snorkle, drive to Hanauamo bay, etc. They have a Hertz counter at the HHV and a Dollar rent a car 2 blocks away. Overally, this is a great resort - You know it's crowded, you know it's expensive, but it's what you probably came to Hawaii for - Warm weather, beaches, fun, etc. If you want quiet, solitude, etc, go to one of the other islands (and expect to pay even more). Dont' let a few dollars ruin a trip this good - Expect to spend about $75 to $100 a day for food and just enjoy it. The Hilton is a great place to get a true Waikiki experience.

<Content>Top choice among Waikiki Hotels We stayed here in March of 2005 just before Easter. I bought the room through Hotwire for about $225 dollars per night. We had a room in the Tapa Tower which was large and spacious - but we were on the side with a poor view.The hotel is absolutely huge and it has great facilities. The grounds are beautiful and well manicured and there is a lot to do right on the property. There are many restaurants (I'm not sure how many but I would estimate 15-20 places) and a lot of nice stores scattered all over the hotel property (including some top designer places). We walked around to some of the other nearby hotels on Waikiki and based on what we saw, we would gladly return to this hotel. The Hilton's grounds and landscaping are VERY attractive. There are some unique things here too - there are warm-weather-African-Penguins and Flamingos on display as well as sculptures and tropical birds throughout the property. Every night, there is a torch lighting ceremony where a costumed Hawaiian Procession blows conch shells and walks around the Hotel lighting torches along all the pathways. Some might complain it's a little too much like a theme park - but it's not juvenile and we enjoyed it.This hotel has the best stretch of Waikiki Beach - much larger beach front area than ANY of the other hotels. Beware, if you want to have a beach chair or umbrella, you'll have to rent it - even if you're staying at the hotel. This is standard procedure for all Waikiki Hotels we saw. The pools at the Hilton were beautiful too and had great waterfalls, etc.The rooms are nice - and every tower here is different. Our beds in the Tapa Tower were to die for. We slept like babies every night on thick pillow top mattresses with fluffy pillows and duvets. Hilton has done a great job at keeping this older hotel fresh and new looking.We ate at the property a few times and had good food - but there are also a ton of dining options outside of the hotel in the Waikiki area that we visited.You can probably find just about anything you're looking for here - a relaxing resort experience or a vibrant hot nightlife. I would hands-down recommend this hotel to anyone staying on Oahu and we would definitely return.

<Content>wonderful stay in paradise Just got back from 17 days in Hawaii- stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village- the first time on March 10th for 4 days, we were upgrade to the Alii tower- wonderful room- this tower has it's own pool which is very nice as the main pool is very crowded and hard to get a chair. The beach is very nice there- the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Food is very expensive- there is a restaurant right off the hotel grounds- the Wailua Coffe Shop and it was great especially for breakfast. When we returned to the hotel after staying on Maui, we were in the Kailua Tower- very nice also- We used the spa facilities and were very impressed. I would suggest you buy snacks, etc. at the ABC store. We were there during easter break and it was very crowded. I have a suggestion for the car rental- we used Alamo and were very happy with it- only thing- they have long long lines- we are Quick Silver Members with Alamo ( which is easy to enroll on the internet). There is a separate counter for Quick Silver and we saved at least a two hour wait!

<Content>Not if you want a quiet vacation / Death of 1000 charges... We stayed for a week at the Hilton (2 adjoining rooms ) over Spring break. While it was a better than average place, overall this is not the place to go if you want some RR or if you dislike getting nickeled and dimed (or worse).Check-in at 12:30AM found us pleading to get any room (we did join HHonors, very necessary to bypass the regular line at 12:30AM) despite guaranteed reservations. We were happy to take a room set to be renovated the next day, since the people in the regular line were being sent to other hotels. The next day we were put in the Tapas Tower in 2 regular view rooms. No free coffee, no free water, With over 3,000 rooms and a 1 year old outdated computer system, there is poor flexibility and any changes take a long time, hence the long check in lines. With over 3,000 rooms you cannot expect to find solitude at the Village. There are 2 smallish pools, costly restaurants and a bizillion shops to take even more of your vacation dollars. Morning coffee was $3.25, parking $13 (valet was $18 and slow, particularly on checkout Sundays). Late checkouts were not allowed but you could reserve 20 minutes per person booked in a room to freshen up if you had a late flight and left your bags with the bell captain for your last day at the beach.Restaurants: Wailana Coffee shop for breakfast, Hale Koa for lunch (walk in from the beach and eat at the poolside) and dinner anywhere on the strip .Two other comments: Buy Oahu Revealed, a very useful book, and do not rent the Chrysler 300 - limited visibility in this car ruins any sightseeing for most riders.

<Content>Horrible service, Very expensive, beautiful area We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian village during low season (early december). When we first arrived we were in awe by the beauty of it all. Then the troubles began. I am a diamond level hilton honors member (it doesn't get higher than that). Upon check in, I was practically accused of having a fake certificate to stay there. The service overall at the hotel was horrible. Absolutely rude. The staff made you feel like they hated you being there and that you were bothering them when you asked them to do their job. No one can offer you directions. No one can recommend a restaurant. Everyone just wants to sell you something.The parking is $12 per day (no other choice) a buffet runs $35 per person for less than average food. The shops and restaurants in the village are ridiculously overpriced. Lunch specials starting at about $25 per person (and these don't include anything other than a basic entree, no sides, no drink, nothing) so you'll easily spend $40 per person for a meal. Be ready to pay $50 for a t-shirt... Overall I could have stomached the prices if the staff were half way decent. They were just too rude to even describe. How about this: We were eating breakfast outside at the beach front cafe, where pigeons and/or seagulls would come onto the table to eat our food. No big deal for an animal lover. Well I took a piece of my bagel and crumbled it on the floor so they would keep off my plate and eat from the floor. The floor sweeper then came and slammed a sign in front of my plate that said, Please don't feed the birds. because he was upset that he had to sweep the crumbs up. I mean, if I wanted to, I could have reported this man for assault! What kind of a person slams a sign onto your breakfast plate???It's all too bad, because the place is beautiful. Our room was gorgeous, clean, and had a spectacular view of beach and mountains. So beautiful that I probably would go back again if I got the room for free again. However, I would never pay the $350-$400 per night. Not for that kind of service.

<Content>Great resort, though pricy We just returned from a weeks stay at the hilton hawaiian village. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.Pros- The grounds are well kept and look beautiful. They have penguins,flamingos and other animals to watch whilst there. Plenty of restaurants and shops. It really is its own village.We were stayed in the Tapa tower and were upgraded to a partial oceanview. (I think this is based on availabilty and the fact that we were hilton honor members). Huge room, very clean, great view of the mountains and city. Separate area to hang up or fold your clothing and included fridge and minibar. The beds are very very comfortable.They also have a big pool, larger then most other hotels and they had a smaller one by the Tapa tower, that was less crowded and easy to find a chair.Every night at the pool, they had hawaiian dancing and on Friday nights they have fireworks.Cons- restaurants are very expensive, it seems that they like to charge you for everything. If you take their towels to the beach, they charge you $10. The rental beach chairs and umbrellas are expensive. You are better off buying from the ABC Store.You have to get to the superpool early to get a chair, otherwise there are none. They need to have more chairs, or a bigger pool. Also the pool was freezing for most of the week as the weather was cool and very windy.Other than that, this is a very nice hotel. Plenty to do in the way of entertainment and shopping. You can arrange tours from the hotel and we were able to do late check-out.All in all, I would recommend this hotel, but I would not go during spring break, as it was packed. Plus there were conventions taking place that week and it was very packed. You would be better off going when it is less packed and you would actually be able to get a seat by the pool. Still a lot nicer then the other hotels in waikki and it is right on the beach.

<Content>Absolutely perfect My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village March 5 - 12. I can't find one thing to complain about. The staff couldn't have been any friendlier or more helpful. Our room was beautiful and daily maid service was excellent. Prices are typical for any nice resort, in my opinion. This was our second trip to the Hilton Hawaiian Village and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Oahu. We've also visited Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island, which are different experiences from Oahu, but I don't think you can go too far wrong at this lovely resort.

<Content>Best Hotel Experience In My Life!!! My wife and I travel a lot on vacations and both agree that this hotel is the best hotel we have every been at. I must first admit that because we were there on my hilton honors points we got upgraded to one of their best suites (which was about 2,100 square feet). So obviously our room was spectacular. We had wonderful views and soooo much space. But besides the room the rest of the hotel was beautiful and huge. There are numerous pools to swim in case one gets crowded you can move to another one. The ocean front property is great because there is so much space you don't feel smothered by other people. The hotel also has a reef to swim over and see all kinds of fish in the water. We chose to not spend the extra money and go snorkeling with a pro and opted to just spend that time snorkeling for free behind the hotel. We loved it!!!! The restaurants were quite expensive but since this is a luxory hotel you have to expect that. My wife and I truly loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone else interested in traveling to Hawaii. This is the hotel to stay at, trust me!!!

<Content>Would definitely go back. We just got back Mar 17th from 8 nights in Honolulu. 3 of them were at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We're a family of 2 adults and 2 daughters aged 10  7.Very simply, there's a reason they call it a 'village' - it's huge. But it doesn't seem overwhelming or anything. There are several towers. Ours was the Alii - apparently one of nicest, if not the best one they have. The tower had its own concierge, own pool  fitness room, etc. You could still use the other ones in the resort, but these offered a little more privacy.They upgraded us from a partial ocean view to a beautiful ocean view room without even asking. The rooms weren't huge, but very nice - one of the most comfortable hotel beds you'll sleep in; like a giant soft pillow. And separate vanity / shower / toilet areas, which helps when you've got 4 people trying to get ready for the day. Big, beautiful beach area. Not as packed as Waikiki beach, either. There's quite a variety of restaurants  places to get snacks, and you're still fairly close to 'outside' restaurants  stores, as well.If you go, make sure you have cash - and I'm talking paper cash, not credit or a bank card. There's only 1 ATM in the entire complex, and it was broken when we needed it. I had to walk a couple miles to the next nearest one. Almost everything can be charged to the room, but we still needed cash for some of the tours / excursions we took.Poolside service was quick, and you could get everything from a full meal to just drinks. A little pricey for some things ($6 for a beer, plus tip??) while others weren't bad ($7 for a personal sized pizza). But it's vacation. And the hotel room has a little fridge, so if you want, you can bring in some of your own refreshments.We couldn't do a late check out because the hotel was full, but they stored our bags for us  gave us a courtesy room for an hour to shower  get changed. It was a nice touch.If we went back to Honlulu, we'd definitely stay at the resort. But we'd probably try one of the other islands (like Maui) first, before returning to Honolulu.

<Author>NewYorkCityJerry
<Content>Great experience if you choose carefully My wife and I came back recently from a 9-night stay at the HHV. We had been there 15 years ago for a convention but this time it was all pleasure. We had an oceanfront with a lanai in Rainbow Towers. It definitely is worth the extra money for an oceanfront, as even when you are not outside, you are in the middle of all of the action (do not confuse oceanfront with the less desirable oceanview). Unfortunately, we ran into a streak of cool, cloudy weather but we spent pleasant hours on the lanai. The beach is pebbly and has broken up coral debris (especially in the shallow water), so bring aqua-shoes. Plan your onsite expenditures strategically, as the HHV sometimes appears to be a huge tropical vacuum-cleaner intent on sucking up all of your dollars. Twenty-four dollars a day for a beach-chair and umbrella is outrageous (although this is operated by a non-hotel beach concession). Instead, get straw mats from the ABC store on the premises ($1 each or free with $10 in purchases) and lay them over with a beach towel. Towels are free from the hotel beach stand. The grounds are lovely to walk through. There is always something new that catches you by surprise, no matter how many times you wander through. Eating can be quite expensive. After a first day of overeating (and overspending) with 3 restaurant meals, and feeling quite stuffed, we returned to our normal at-home habit of a modest breakfast and lunch followed by one big restaurant meal of the day. We were able to stock up on breakfast items at ABC (juice, cold cereal, milk, coffee, paper bowls, etc.) and have relaxed breakfasts on the lanai. Stay away from the locked food 鈥渂ar鈥?in your room. $3.50 for a wimpy coffee refill packet (containing 10% Kona coffee) is really over the top. Instead, get a pack of filter papers and a pack of real 100% Kona coffee for use with your coffee machine. Lunches centered around take-out sandwiches or salads from ABC.If you don鈥檛 object to having early dinners, you can save money by making reservations for early-bird or sunset specials. Look carefully through the room literature and coupons to find these. Interestingly, the non-Hilton operated restaurants on-site tended to be far superior to the Hilton restaurants within the Rainbow Tower. Of the non-Hilton operated restaurants, Sergio鈥檚 was our clear favorite. Our two meals there were as good as any we have eaten in New York City or Tuscany. We also enjoyed Hatsuhana (a simple, straight-forward Japanese restaurant), Benihana (as much a fun performance as a good meal) and to somewhat less of a degree, Village Steak and Seafood. Regarding the Hilton restaurants within the Rainbow Tower, the Rainbow Lanai was pleasant but had rather ordinary food. The buffets were bountiful and of enormous variety but in the end it was largely steam-table food. Bali by the Sea (the most expensive of the restaurants) was a big disappointment. It started off on a wrong note after we had made a clear phone reservation for the 6-pm seating of their sunset dinner. When we ordered, we were told that this special dinner is restricted to the summertime, in spite of the clear up-to-date information to the contrary in our room. So we had the regularly priced dinners. As an example of the pricing, $12.50 for a glass of ordinary table wine was more than I have paid anywhere in the world (it was less than half of this at Sergio鈥檚). The surroundings and settings were beautiful, the wait staff and service were impeccable, and the food was beautifully presented; however, it was mediocre in taste. Their heralded 鈥渃hampagne鈥?dressing ceremoniously spooned over the salad at the table tasted like watered-down mayonnaise. My wife鈥檚 prawns were dry and overcooked; my duck breast was flavorful but with a fatty skin that had to be cut away and discarded. It lacked the skin crispness that one expects at these prices. The complementary chocolate dessert, however, was a lovely touch.Don鈥檛 miss the Friday evening poolside Hawaiian show. Get there early, have a pizza from Round Table Pizza Express for dinner and enjoy the show and fireworks. Most evenings we went to one of the lounges for a drink(s) and entertainment. This varied but the best by far was on Friday and Saturday nights at the Paradise lounge by a marvelous group called Olomana. Don鈥檛 miss it. Another pleasant group of musicans (together with dinner) was at 鈥淗ouse Without a Key鈥? about 15 minutes away in the Halekulani hotel.

<Content>LA in the middle of the ocean If you enjoy going to the middle of the ocean for peace and relaxtion and do not mind spending it with 8,000 of your new friends this is the place for you. The service was OK considering there are 3400 rooms. It is a hike to the spa as it is located in a seperate tower on the fourth floor. The swimming is in a protective cove with no waves. Forget bogey boarding. Waikiki and Honolulu in general are packed. Some of the worst traffic I have ever seen. If you want large crowds this is your place. If you want peace and quite go to Kauai.

<Content>Over comercialized, non-relaxing, bad service!! ,Chaos, is the order of the day at HHV. You'll notice it right away as you arrive at the front desk. Is this Disneland? There are many people rushing around, hotel staff to busy to help you. Theres a hotel desk with a crowd of people around and your told to wait in three defferent lines. One for early people, one for luggage, one for check in. You cant tell who is being helped and if they are ever gonna get to you.While waiting for our room my husband and I ate at the little resteraunt on the beach which is part of the hotel. The place was a zoo we had to sit at a dirty table and wait 20 minutes before the waitress came back to take our order. We shared nachos and ate half of it to discover a wierd looking twig in it we called the waitress over and she gave us a hard time about saying we ate most of it. She came back and told us the cook identified the big twig as a grape stem. Quality control???! Our nachos were compt but not with out attitude. We waited another 20 minutes just to pay. We check in at the chaotic front desk and went to our room in the Tapas tower. Nice room, well decorated and it had nice bedding, down comforters. My husband went to use the phone it wasn t working it took 2 hours to send someone up to fix it. Then the charges start, they charge you for just about everything here, local phone call, parking, coffee, tea, internet, use of excercise room, towels and chairs by the beach etc. You'll get nickel  dimed here till your stay cost as much as a 5 star hotel price. At night I noticed the bathroom stunk like urine and I had to shut the door but the smell still kinda came through. Over all staff was not very friendly,we went to various shops in HHV to pick up the free gifts got greeted with a frown and a cheap luggage tag shoved at us. hhmmm. The place is good for shopping and the location is walking distance to the main area in Waikiki, better like to walk! I advise not to get your hair done at the Mandarin Spa I had my hair hi-lited there and it came out terrible worst experiece of my life. My hair ended up being a solid, brassy blond color. There wasnt a relaxing moment there. If you come to Hawaii for the island feel dont stay here.

<Content>Was a little more than average My boyfriend and I just got back from Hawaii and we stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for 7 nights. The hotel was pretty nice, our room was great (very clean) , and we had an excellent view. I believe most of the mattresses at this property are all pillow top, so that was a great added bonus. Most of the staff was very helpful and friendly, except for the front desk. Be prepared to spend money at this hotel, they defiantly seem to have a charge for everything! Parking is $18 per day for valet and $13 per day for self-parking. To use the coffee maker it is $3.50 and to use the safe it is $3.50 per day. To use the gym it is $18 per day for hotel guests. Don't even think about touching the bar provided in your room, it would be best to go to one of the million ABC's stores or to Wal-Mart. Most of the places to eat are pretty expensive that are within the resort, the cheapest thing they have is an $8 hot dog. The hotel only has 2 pools, and in order to get a chair you must go early before 10am and save it (put your towel down, even if you are not going to sit there until later) This is by far a family hotel....it seemed that everything closed at 11pm. However, the hotel has it's own beach (which is sweet!) and it is in a great locations. The hotel has many shops and many animals roaming the property. All in all I was very pleased with my stay.

<Content>Not too shabby.... Just recently, my fianc茅e and I went to Oahu for a business/pleasure trip. We were very pleased to find out that our employer had booked us in such a beautiful hotel. In front as you make you way around to the main entrance are some impressive bronze statues of 3 Polynesian dancers. Beautiful. When driving up to the main entrance to the Hotel, you are greeted by large beautiful trees wrapped in twinkle lights, cute little shops and restaurants. Upon check-in, there were little 鈥榰nforeseen鈥?problems that most hotels don鈥檛 normally do. This particular hotel charged up-front the whole hotel stay, vs., waiting for you to check-out and settle your tab. Another unexpected predicament that we could have been informed about is- how they charged an additional $400.00 in 鈥榠ncidentals鈥?up-front on our credit card that took away some extra spending money out of our pockets. Yes, we were refunded the amount, but it was an unexpected fee that we didn鈥檛 see coming. The rooms are clean and there are fresh towels every day. The staff seemed to be friendly and accommodating until we ran into a little problem with the moldy smell of our room. We asked to be relocated to another room with better ventilation 鈥?but our request went unfulfilled. One funny thing that I initially did not find amusing the first day of our stay is that the cleaning staff kept turning on our alarm clock set to go off at 7:am every morning. When it had gone off the first morning, I was sure to turn it off and check it every day thereafter. It became a funny joke afterwards when we managed to foil the pranks of our hotel cleaning staff. The outside of the hotel was constantly being kept up. The walk ways were always clean, the pools were immaculate, and the grounds and ponds were very lovely. The hotel had a few exotic birds roaming the gardens which gave the hotel an aire of 鈥榯ropicality鈥? For a few days stay, it鈥檚 not too shabby. But be advised, have extra room in your credit cards for 鈥榰nforeseen charges鈥?that they may decide to 鈥榩op up鈥?on you. Otherwise, aloha and have a nice time! Mahalo!

<Content>A visit to Paradise Just completed a visit to Honolulu, Hawaii after not having been there for over 5 years. This time we stayed at the Lagoon Tower of the Hilton Hawaiian village in a one bedroom condo. We had a wonderful Ocean View from the 15th floor. The services of the hotel were very much above average. Everyone went out of their way to assist you and to make your stay more enjoyable. Realizing late that we were not leaving the island until late in the evening, we requested the hotel allow us to stay until just prior to going to the Airport. While we couldn't stay in the same room, they did put us up in another room so we could relax during the day. It made the trip even more enjoyable. Kudo's to the staff of the Hilton Hawaiian for making this a great trip. Can't wait until I go back again.

<Content>Check-in Nightmare Was initially very excited to be going to Hawaiian Village. However, after a grueling trip that began with 7:30 am arrival at Philadelphia airport, we arrived at Hawaiian Village at about 10:30 pm Hawaiian time (3:30 am, Phila. time.) Hotel was overbooked and we spent another hour waiting for a room, even though our reservations had been made and confirmed since October, and we had guaranteed late arrival. Staff was very courteous though not very helpful. I found it quite interesting that though having a room reservation did not guarantee you a room right away, you could not extend check-out time. Check-in problems cast a pall over the entire time we were there. The place is beautiful but not more so than many Carribean islands.

<Content>very disappointed We stayed at the HHV for 4 nights following 3 nights at the Rennaissance Ilikai next door. We were there for a conference and had a conference rate room which is probably their lowest standard room. We did not expect much, such as a view(our view overlooked the garage). These are the reasons why we would never return to this hotel:1. They advertise coffee makers in all the rooms(this is very important to us) but they don't tell you that you have to pay $3.50 for each little 4cup coffee pack. They have a cube frig but no microwave.2. This is a huge, impersonal hotel. You start by waiting in line to check in. You wait in line for everything. You have to walk a bit to get to your room.3. Their standard policy is no early check-in's or late check-outs allowed.4. Check out time is 11am. Our flight was at 5:20 so we asked to have our luggage stored. They pointed at a huge tent and said get in that line(it was a very long line).5. Their beach is a disappointment. The sand is rocky, its very crowded, and almost no waves. Their is a pier right there and a commercial type boat goes in and out.6. For a hotel of this size, there are only 2 very small pools.7. There is a village of stores along the entrance. Very commercial atmosphere.Hated this place. For the same money, I'd go somewhere else.

<Content>Great for families Travelled to HHV in February with two teenagers. We were delighted with the hotel, the beach and the many services offered at the HHV. We stayed in the Kalia Tower. The rooms were always clean and the staff was very friendly. My children enjoyed the village atmosphere. I always log onto tripadvisor before making a reservation to see what others thought of a hotel. I appreciate the information from other travellers and find it is far more accurate than any other source I have come across.

<Content>Excellent Experience My colleague and I spent 7 nights at the HHV for a conference - we arrived there 4 days early to relax beforehand. Here are the great points:- the beds (in the Tapa Tower). These things are so comfortable: they have great linens and each bed has four down pillows and down comforters. We were trying to figure out how to pack up the bed and take it home. We fell asleep in seconds.- the Mandara Spa. Included in whatever treatment you choose, you get all-day access to the other spa facilities: hot tub, steam room, sauna, and so on. We chose the Chocolate Macademia Nut body scrub, which was incredibly painful, but which in the end was worthwhile because we were smooth as silk. The prices are very good. $115 for 50 min. of scrubbing, plus 18% tax and gratuity combined.- the grounds. These are meticulously maintained and always interesting. Flamingos, penguins, orchids, parrots, fish ponds, waterfalls and flowers were everywhere. The architecture is bad in terms of the towers - it's the 70s, so you do get the feel of concrete prison blocks, but the groundscaping really makes up for it, as well as the public buildings.- shopping. I did not shop (I spent all my money at the spa and the Tapa Bar), but there was a lot of selection: Louis Vuitton, Lancome and other high-end skin care, a Spa shop which sells the products they use in the spa, and so on.- the Tapa bar: this place is expensive, but it is a great place to unwind. The high ceiling protects from any rain (which we did not experience), but it is entirely open air.- the beach: now, this beach is not the most impressive; the sand is very dull in colour and has large grains, but it was kept very clean and while there were many people there, it was never so packed that you couldn't have a private conversation. I have been to many great beaches, and this one does not rank in the top 5 by any stretch, but I don't have complaints about it at all (by the way, don't hope to find a lover on this beach - it is largely family-oriented)- check in and out was pretty good; rapid and friendly. However, I should note that I had a HHonors member card, which allowed me to use a special line. A woman with whom we shared a cab to the airport indicated that she had a very bad, time consuming experience at the front desk.- Roundtable Pizza is very good and relatively inexpensive.We paid a conference rate of $197 per night for a non-ocean view in the Tapa Tower. Our room had an empty refrigerator which we filled on one trip to the foodstore and which helped defray the costs associated with eating on 'campus' constantly. I think it was entirely worth the price for what you got in return. The only things that were not really very enjoyable were: 1) the entertainment in the evenings. The hula stuff at the superpool was cool, but the music in the bars is sort of like Hawaiian Roy Orbison, as one colleague observed. Also, I really don't like the ROTC kids being involved as an entertainment factor - I wasn't entertained. 2) the prices at the bars were too high. 3). the bars stop serving at 11 pm. This is because they are essentially in the courtyards below the balconies, and the noise drifts up and people then complain. I wasn't there to party, so it was fine for me, but if you're looking for late nights, they'll have to take place in your room.Overall: This was a really good vacation. I would not have vacationed in Hawaii if I had a choice, but it ended up being a great time. This is a very nice hotel with friendly, responsive staff and a lot to offer. I would recommend it. And come prepared to spend money.

<Content>Had a Great Week Cant go wrong at the HHV. We were considering some of the other hotels but after walking down to the main strip, glad we didn't. Way too busy, like college spring break. And unless beachfront (like HHV), you have to cross a major street or 2 to get to the beach.The HHV has the best beach, is somewhat isolated from the rest of the hotels, yet is a short walk to all the action and downtown shopping. We walked each night but constant shuttles and buses were an option.As others have noted, the on site restaurants are very expensive. We used them sparingly. The best on site deals were the Kirin and Budweiser Happy Hour 4-7 for about $1.50 beer. This was at the Japanese restaurant onsite. Also the KuanaDog stands at the Tapa bar and at the Rainbow Tower beach, had good deals for hot dogs (about $3). Otherwise, bagels were $4.25 for example in the onsite cafes. Pizza and other items were a bit expensive too. The ABC Store, at the hotel, had great prices for straw beach mats ($2), bottled water, and other staples like cereal, milk, coffee. Visit it your first day.Join Hilton Honors before you go. Gives you 5pm check out time (depending on availability) and possible free upgrade, and 2 free bottles of in room water.Snorkel at Hanamau Bay was our favorite thing. We drove the 30 minute drive but package deals are plentiful which include hotel pick up and drop off. Lots of colorful fish and onsite equipment rental makes everything easy.Happy Hour at Dukes (Outrigger hotel) was lots of fun. Right on the beach and really vibrant place. Great place to see the sun set.

<Content>The Hilton is the place for 24 Hours of non-stop action We just returned with my family from 8 days and 7 nights at the HHV in Honolulu.....Honeymooners beware....this is not the place for you to seek peace and tranquility while on your Hawaiian vacation! This is a complex of 5 large towers on a sprawling landscape built for business conventions and large groups of any sort. Don't get me wrong...the hotel room was extremely nice (we stayed in an Oceanfront Room at the Kalia Tower which is brand new with beautiful bedding, bathrooms and furnishings), however, the HHVillage is designed to suit the needs of anyone and everyone with shops, its own grocery store, numerous restaurants and the biggest and nicest beach on Waikiki...sounds good if you want 24 hours of non-stop action. Further down the beach is even more crowded as there are numerous hotels with waterside dining, beach bars, music, surfing lessons.....you name it, it's on Waikiki Beach. We opted to spend our days at different sights and beaches around the island, particularly Kailua and Lanikai on the Northeast shore (about a 20 minute ride)...just spectacular for swimming and watching the locals windsurf and kitesurf...nice group of people. Also, don't go without a day at Hanuama Bay for snorkeling....it's only a $5.00 admission price for the most memorable experience on the coast of Oahu, not to mention it sits on a beautiful beach with nice shade (you will roast in the Hawaiian sun out there unless you find a palm tree or two). Rent your equipment at Snorkel Bob's in Honolulu ($8 per day) and be at the park NO later than 8 AM to get parking! Another good deal near the Village is the Wailana Coffee shop just across the street...they give you a wonderful breakfast complete with pancakes, pineapple juice and Kona coffe that is just to die for at very reasonable prices....much more reasonable than the hotel prices which are way out of line. The other find which helped was the Ena Laundry (just a block behind the coffee shop). Just drop off your bags of laundry in the morning and they will wash, dry and fold it for you for $1.00 a pound.....they do an awesome job and it saved us time, money and alleviated any dirty laundry to fly home with. As far as restaurants go, the best on the island by far is Hoku's at the Kahala Mandarin Oriental Hotel...this is 5-star dining at a 5-star hotel but the food and atmosphere was worth the price for one night. The nice part for my daughters was seeing the dolphins swim at the lagoon which encircles the grounds of this beautiful hotel. Pure 100% elegance without all of the fussiness that you would find in a metropolitan area. As far as luaus go, we did attend the Royal Hawaiian Luau on Waikiki Beach and it was enjoyable but is a huge production for literally hundreds of guests and is anything but traditional if that is what you are looking for. The dancers were beautiful and the music was nice but I missed the more tradional show at the Old Lahaina luau on the island of Maui that I saw several years ago. There is nothing worse than seeing a beautiful, cultural tradition turned into a Vegas-style show. However, if you want to go to a large resort where you never have to leave to shop, dine or sun yourself, this may be the right place for you. Be aware that the pools are not heated and you must arrive by 8:00AM at the main pool to get a chair....and people actually line up early for these! The chairs and umbrellas on the beach are quite expensive to rent for an entire week. The Hilton needs to revise this policy in a huge way. Similar luxury resorts would never dream of hitting their guests up for a simple chair for the day. You will also pay $13.00 a day to park your rental car in the hotel garage. Welcome to the Hilton everyone!

<Content>Very enjoyable stay at HHV Spent 4 nights at the HHV at the end of Jan 2005. We arrived well before the published check in time so weren't surprised that the room wasn't ready. Unlike other guests who had come in on the same flight we didn't complain at check in - which is probably why we were so well looked after. We were allocated a room in the Ali'i tower - which we hadn't booked but definitely the best tower with it's own pool and gym , complimentary breakfast and sunset cocktail receptions. We headed off to grab a coffee and to explore for an hour or so. Our room was ready exactly when we had been told - when we got there our bags were already waiting for us as well as some chilled bottles of water. Our stay continued in this mode - staff were very friendly and helpful throughout, restaurants were good (a little expensive - but what do you expect?) The Polynesia show was colourful - and probably not very authentic! - but the fireworks were great. Best spot to view the show is the cocktail lounge in the Ali'i. Conversely the live act in the Shell Bar - Jennifer and John? - were quite outstanding. All in all a very enjoyable stay

<Content>Exactly What You Expect, nothing more, nothing less. We have just returned from the Hilton, we stayed from the 12th Feb for 5 nights. The hotel is modern and clean with all that you would expect from a resort hotel, large pool, bars and 1000's of people. Despite how busy this hotel is, we did still manage to get sun beds at the pool and the beach, even during the Pro Bowl weekend.The service was very good, but we did find it really difficult to get reservations for dinner in any of the hotels restaurants, even booking in the morning is a no-no. Try 48 hours before. (So think a head for the night you arrive, call ahead).The rooms were clean and well maintained and the maid service was prompt and efficient.If you want a quiet time, with not too many people, then this is not the hotel for you. If you are looking for a lively time, then this a good choice for Waikiki.

<Content>When does "Ocean view" mean " Ocean View" Just returned from 3 nights at Hilton Hawaiian Village. Overall a great relaxing time however, not without its annoying bits.Check in - Arrived at 1pm after travelling from Vancouver (up since 5am) room not ready but assured it's beautiful with a wonderful sun set view 28th floor Rainbow tower. After wandering deliriously for over an hour we finally pick up the key. Head to 28th floor open door ..hang on isn't this supposed to be an ocean view? What's that building doing there? Oh I see you have to go out on the balcony and hang over the edge looking left....there it is. Sorry I'm not paying $300us+ per night for this view.Hang on where's the sparkling wine that was supposed to meet us on arrival?Down we go to the assistant duty manager introduce myself advise I'm not happy with the view from the room. They're all Ocean view in the rainbow building is her response. Well long story short if you want a guaranteed Ocean view of the beach you need to book an Ocean Front suite. After being dismissed by the manager to her assistant ( she was the assistant manager so I guess i was now dealing with the assistant's assistant) we got transferred from 2804 to 1815 which had a great view of the beach.However, still waiting for the sparkling wine on arrival...Oh, and don't be taken in by the  Use of Mandara Spa as part of the package. No relaxing therapies here unless you consider a treadmill a relaxing therapy.

<Content>Kalia Tower was fabulous My husband and I stayed in the Kalia Tower (Club Floor) in mid October 2004. Our stay was nothing short of absolutely fabulous! Everything from the view, room decor, complimentary breakfast and nightly cocktails were #1. During our stay I was lucky enough to win one of the daily prize drawings at the Spa in our tower. I had an amazing 90 minute massage, after which I decided to finish my afternoon relaxing at the outdoor pool by the spa...which was cut short by some of the kids who felt that screaming and running around the pool deck and throwing water balloons - somehow added to the enjoyment of the spa/hotel guests. Pool is for all hotel guests but parents should remember - the pool is part of the spa!

<Content>I Thought it was great... I went to the HHV on my honeymoon and we had a magical time. They put us on the 27th floor of the Rainbow Tower in a corner suite when I had reserved an oceanview room. Yes, the food was expensive, but you can't expect Iowa prices in Hawaii. Overall a great RESORT (which equals large), mainly because everything was at your disposal.

<Content>First Hilton, First time Hawaii, still suprised My husband and I , along with our 5 year old just returned from a week trip to Oahu. We had decided on the HHV as the Hale Koa was already booked, which is right next door. We were going to visit our son who is in the Navy in SUNNY Hawaii. Not sunny, cold and rainy. The swimming pools at the HHV are very nice but almost unbearable to get into as the water is so cold! The temperature does not get up much in the day, due to the breeze and the mountains. For the beach bring water shoes as it is not soft sand it is rocky and your feet will sink!We were upgraded to the Ali Tower, which was an excellent suprise and the room was very nice. We had a Corner ocean view room, which was also overlooking the pool. The second balcony overlooked the gardens and the common park between the HHV and the Hale Koa. It also gave us extra privelages that other towers did not have. For example the hot tub, which was nice on a cold day, also coffee in the room was included (apparently 3.50 in the other room!). We found the service was excellent everywhere that we went within the village. We had housekeeping services several times a day. As for the bed, comfortable. If you have ever stayed in a Westin, it is just like their Heavenly bed! For our 5 year old this was a dream come true to be here in this room as he loved the views! So if possible try to get the A tower and a room ending in 5.We really didn't see a need for a rental car as a taxi was cheap when we didnt walk places that were close. We did rent a car to see Pearl Harbor , a must see and that same day drove the coast line to view the North Shore! We had purchase a book prior to leaving called Oahu Reaveled, very helpful. Dining options at HHV, Oceanside, Tropics, Bennihanas, Tapa Cafe and Roundtable Pizza is good. Otherwise check out the Harbor bay Pub a few blocks away for Pizza and sandwiches! Also film developing is much cheaper there!! Look for the coupons and go to the Discovery Bay 1 hour photo!I am sure I would stay here again, however I just wish the beach wasn't so rocky and the pool was heated! But then again moms can be picky about cold water, because dad and the little guy didn't seem to mind! If you love to shop this is the place to be, 90 stores to choose from!

<Content>Loved the HHV We just got back from a wonderful vacation in Hawaii. Three islands and ending in Las Vegas. (See other reviews for Maui, Kauai and Vegas)Oahu was our first stop. We could not have been more pleased with our room and service in the Kalia tower. We had a view of the lagoon. The bed was soooooo comfortable and cozy. The room was clean. We spent a lot of time doing tourist things, so the pool and beach expenses were not an issue for us.Pearl Harbor was very sad and the USS Missouri was very interesting. Punch Bowl Cemetary was also sad, but nice to read the big wall.If you can physically do it go to Diamond Head and climb it. It was the best thing that we did. It was hard and we hurt for a couple of days but it was so worth it. Also, we booked the Poly. Culture Ctr at the desk and had the best lady from NY help us. She was such a card and gave more helpful info than necessary. She told us to follow the buses back to Waikiki which was easier. Also, she said not to leave anything in the car, so we locked everything in the trunk each time we left the car. She was right, when we went to Pearl Harbor a car not far from ours had a smashed window.We would go back in a second and stay at the HHV without a question.Yes, the food is expensive, but I agree with a previous reviewer. It's Hawaii what do you expect. Go to the ABC store in HHV and get your water and snacks, it helped.Fantastic trip and thanks to the HHV for making it what we expected.

<Content>Loved it! We stayed in five hotels during our stay in Hawaii, including one that was more expensive and supposed to be a lot nicer, but the Hilton Hawaiian Village was by far our favorite - mostly because of the phenomenal, professional service. When we pulled up, an extremely friendly and helpful bellman opened our door, helped us with our bags, and parked our car. The check-in line was short (even at a busy time of day), and the receptionist was extremely friendly and upgraded our room for free when he heard it was our belated honeymoon.The view was spectacular, and the grounds are gorgeous and almost a little city in itself. On Friday nights, there are fireworks at 8 p.m., bands playing throughout the grounds, etc. The beach is great, nice soft sand, and the pool was neat. They also have penguins and flamingoes - fun little surprises like that made this a fun place to stay.

<Content>Never Again!!! This hotel was recommended very highly by a world traveler with kids. So we booked it without looking elsewhere or with the help of online reviews. Very disappointed. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower in an ocean view suite which was actually very nice with a great view of Wiakiki and Diamond Head, but very expensive for what you got overall. There were no extras. For example, the pool was too small and crowded, thus no chairs. The beach was also small and the chairs were $20 EACH EACH DAY with umbellas extra. Towels were extra too. Everything had to be returned by 5 pm or you were charged a late fee. Ridiculous and should be included.Exercise room was another extra. Parking was extra and there was no call ahead service so you had to wait. Faxes were not delivered to your room even if requested. Service was really absent. There was also a constant push to enroll in Time Share Property. They tried to entice us with gifts, which our kids really wanted, but were almost impossible to get. (Hotel COMPLEX is so big that staff doesn't even know where things are).We loved our visit to Honolulu, despite the hotel experience. Waikiki and the whole island was fun for my wife and I and our 2 kids (7  10 yrs). There is a lot to do and a rental car is a must if you really want to experience the Island. North Shore Surfing, Turtles and Snorkeling were great. Would recommend getting OAHU: Revealed as a great guide book, it has everything one needs to REALLY know.We would do Waikiki again, but will try another hotel.

<Content>Don't honeymoon here My husband and I chose HHV as the second part of our honeymoon. We previously spent a week in Maui before heading to Oahu. We were very discouraged when we arrived at the hotel. Parking was chaos, and even though my husband is a Hilton Honors member, we still had to wait in line. We booked a package online that promised an Ocean View room in the Rainbow tower. When we got to our room there was no view of the ocean and the room was dirty. We spoke to the manager and she finally gave us a different room with a view of the ocean. Forget about laying out at the pool unless you get there at 8:00 A.M. Very crowded and dirty. The food was ok at the hotel but very pricey for the quality. The only good thing about HHV was leaving. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone!!!

<Content>Not what we expected We've stayed in many nice hotels, and AmEx platinum travel services recommended the exclusive Ali鈥檌 tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Waikiki beach. Those accustomed to fine hotels and resorts will be disappointed.The HHV is huge- perfect location, lots of shopping, it's right on the beach and the unique varitey of wildlife and landscaping make it one of the most beautiful resorts on Waikiki. If that's all that's important to you, then this is your place. If you're concerned with first class service and dining, skip this hotel.Like the other reviews read, the food is mediocre at best. The breakfast and lunch buffet had a decent selection, but both were overpriced and not particularly tasty. The only exception is the Golden Dragon chinese restaraunt, which was fantastic; priced a little high, but worth every cent.Service was terrible. This is one of those places that's almost too big- management can't seem to handle all the variables. We stayed here during the week before Christmas, which must have been during one of the hotel's busiest weeks because there was a line for everything from chairs and umbrellas for the beach to tables for breakfast. Not what you expect when you pay top dollar for a room.Think we're nit-picking? Read on:We also didn't expect to pay thirteen dollars per day (!!) to park in our own hotel. We opted to pay five dollars more and have our car valet parked-- another mistake. Like the previous days, on the day of our checkout, we waited a long time for the valets to pull our car around. When we informed them we had to get to the airport to check-in on time, they had informed us they had lost our car rental keys.Yes, we missed our flight and had to wait at the airport for several hours, and the story continues. We never stayed in a Hilton hotel before, and this is not at all what we expected. I mean, one night we actually had to call housekeeping to have our room turned down! Come on. Spend your hard-earned dollars on a smaller place where management can handle their guests and visit the Hilton Hawaiian Village for shopping and pictures of the flamingos and penguins. Don't forget your camera.

<Content>Good choice for a resort-style hotel in Waikiki We stayed at the HHV in July 2004, and had a good time there. We had previously stayed at the Outrigger on the Beach, which is a nice place. We were attracted by the HHV because it seemed to have more resort type amenities. I would say that overall, we were satisfied.This place is not luxurious, but comfortable. We stayed in the Ali'i tower, which I would recommend. The HHV is a massive resort, and has a very crowded feeling. Staying in the Ali'i tower helps, since you have your own pool and separate bar only for Ali'i guests. The beach in this part of Waikiki is nice because it is very wide. There is surfing and even snorkling (not great snorkling) right off the beach. Overall, the HHV is a good choice if you want something resembling a resort hotel experience in Waikiki. However, if you want an intimate, uncrowded atmosphere, this is not the place (in fact, if that is what you want, Waikiki is not the place to go at all - instead, go to the Mauna Lani or Hapuna Prince on the Big Island, or the Ritz Carlton Kapalua on Maui).

<Content>A Pleasant Experience When we checked in we asked kindly for a nice room. This request was accomodated as we were given a spacious suite in the Tapa tower with a pool/ocean view for the same price as our regular room would have been. The hotel's beach was great and much better than any other hotel's beach we saw. The only beach complaint is that a chair costs $12 and an umbrella $20 to rent for 1 day. The food at the hotel was very overpriced and not very good so we went elsewhere - Roy's, Alan Wong's, and Nick's Fishmarket were all excellent meals. The Wailana coffee shop across the street was inexpensive and great for breakfast. The staff was very friendly, the hotel was lively, and the grounds were well kept. Overall, we really liked this hotel and would especially recommend it for families.

<Content>Not Again I go to Hawaii on business about once a year and every other year my wife joins me and we hit some of the other islands. My client is on Oahu so I'm forced to stay there. Not a big crowd person and Waikiki is a sea of fanny-pack-toting tourists so I steer clear. My wife is very much the same way; her attitude is that she's in Hawaii to relax and soak up the beauty. Not ride trolly cars and buy t-shirts at an ABC store.With that said, on her third trip over we did a couple of nights at the HHV. Ugh. It was like a Human Warehouse. I'm not anti-complex when it comes to hotels. Some of the Disney resorts get it right. This was simply a churning cauldron of humanity. The beach was littered with cigarette butts. The super pool was right out of a Holiday Inn in Ohio. And so packed you couldn't get within 100 feet of it.The food was marginal and so expensive that we stayed away. To top it off, we were on the top floor but underneath the machinery that powers the elevator. Get the audio picture? The man in the room next to us did something with stocks so he was up at 3 am in Hawaii to handle market issues. How do I know that? I could hear every word he said...between rumblings of the elevator.If you have a family. This might not be bad. If you've never been to Hawaii and aren't here for a cultural experience or quiet, this might work.Suggestion: get your rental car and spend one day going up the middle of the island to Halaiwa, then east and down the leeward shore through Kailua and then down past Sandy Beach (amazing but watch yourself. You can really really get hurt) and then around Diamond Head. Also, if you want true peace and are relegated to Oahu, go to the west shore. Up past Makaha. Miles and miles and miles of beautiful quiet beaches. The last time I was there it was me and two women with a small child. On maybe two miles of beach. THAT'S Hawaii. And about a 45 minute drive from the HHV. Worth it.

<Content>Ali'i Tower I spent 4 days during the late summer and enjoyed every moment of the hotel experience. I personally could care less about all the shops that take up much of the village space, but did find a nice variety of restaurants. The Ali'i Tower offered wonderful - continual - service. I found fresh ice in the room several times daily and the quality of the rooms and fittings were appreciated. I am glad I paid slightly more than some friends and had a larger oceanfront room with a wonderful view and the guarantee of one king bed. Two friends opted for the basic room which was quite a bit smaller and their request for one queen/king bed was not granted and they ended up with these smaller rooms with two double beds crowded into the room.I really do not understand why any hotel, especially higer end hotels, have so many rooms with multiple beds. The only other issue is that it was not made clear that there was a seperate check in desk for the Ali'i Tower. I did not find this out until after waiting for more than 45 minutes at the general check in area for the other towers.

<Content>Wonderful Week at the Hilton Hawaiian We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village from Dec. 19 through the 26th, 2004. It is a top-notch resort and our stay was without problems overall. Thanks to all the great advice I read on tripadvisor before my trip, I registered for the HHonors program ahead of time, and it paid off. Upon check-in we were immediately upgraded from our reserved 2 gardenview rooms to 2 oceanview rooms in the Tapa Tower. (There were 6 in our party - my family of 4, grandmother, and another family friend.)As advised on this webpage, we also took advantage of the Vacation Club (timeshare) offer to sit through the presentation in order to receive $100 in hotel dollars to be used onsite at any of the restaurants and shops. ( - - tell them that their timeshare is the price of a small car, so therefore you can't make that type of decision this quickly - it worked for us!) Believe me, if you can stand to endure the sales pitch and sales pressure, you'll be happy to have the $100 with the resort prices of everything (virgin pina colada - $9, without tip!!) at the hotel! With that $100 our family of 4 was able to enjoy a fun meal at the Benihana one night, thus making the 90 minutes of sales pressure worth it.Our hotel room was a very nicely-appointed regular hotel room with a nice view of the lagoon. There was a small refrigerator and additional small sink provided outside the bathroom, which came in handy with 2 teenage girls. As advised on this webpage, we did not use the hotel-supplied water bottles and coffee-making supplies. (We were able to purchase individual coffee packets and water from local ABC Stores for a much lower price.) The hotel was very accommodating with the holidays. They scheduled the showing of a lot of family-friendly movies in their showroom, so whether the weather was inclement or everything closed for Christmas Day, then there was always something to do. The evening shows at the pool were very nice with the dancers performing a very professional show. At the end of each show some of the members go out into the audience, shake each person's hand, and thank them for attending their show. I think that is a very nice touch. Our only real complaint was that there is no laundry onsite for guests of the hotel. They do provide laundry facilities for guests in their Vacation Club, a point the sales rep was quick to make during the sales pitch. But we still didn't see that having the laundry would make any stay worth the price of a small car! There is a laundry a few blocks away, but we managed to make due without it. I just know that we'd have packed better had we known there was no laundry available onsite for non-vacation club guests. You do pay daily for onsite parking, including self-serve, so plan that into the price of your rental car. We found a great deal for the rental car by riding the Waikiki Shuttle to and from the airport to our hotel, and then walking to the local Enterprise office, 2 blocks away. All-in-all, we'll be happy to stay at the Hilton Hawaiian again. It is a fun place with lots to do, and plenty of people-watching. There are many beautiful places just to sit, relax, and watch the world go by. The hotel wildlife is neat with penguins, flamingoes, a black swan, parrots, and many assorted fish. If you are looking for film opportunities, they are abundant. (It's also a neat place for running into tv/movie stars, too. My teenage girls were thrilled to see and briefly meet two male tv stars who were staying there while we were there.)

<Content>Xmas at the Ali'i Tower..Wonderful!! Our family spent 11 nights over the Xmas holidays ath the Ali'i tower. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and our family of four. Being a platinum amex member and my husband a Gold Hiltonhhonours member maybe gave us the extra privileges of room upgrades, complimentary continental bkfast at the lovely ocean terrace and complimentary evening hors d'ovres every evening while watching the amazing sunset.My parents were in 827 which they truly enjoyed. The 27 ending rooms overlook the super pool and the beach. The wraparound balcony had enough space so that the whole clan could watch the Friday evening fireworks...spectacular. The other families were in an OV category which afforded us a lovely view of Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach.PROS:1. Ali'i tower has amazing service, from the wait staff at the breakfast at the Ocean Terrace, to the front staff, to the exceptional concierge staff (Amelia, Mark, Sidney, Aki), thank you for all your assistance.2. Private pool with hot tub for Ali'i guests was wonderful even for children (who are well-behaved).3. Guest rooms are spacious with a large dressing/washroom.4. Guests are not nickled and dimed for every convenience..i.e. coffee, private gym facilities,newspaper, free bottled water.etc.5. Maid service was exceptional, unobtrusive, 3x daily.6. Lovely wide expanse of beach fronting resort complex compared to almost non-existent beach at Halekulani.7. Lovely grounds with something appealing to all age groups. Feels more like a resort that a city hotel on a beach, which most other properties felt like. 8. ABC store on premises. Great for stocking up for fruit, suishi, wine, etc. in the 2nd fridge in Ali'i guest rooms. (one fridge was a mini-barwhich we didn't use.)CONS:1. Super pool temperature was very cold compared to Ali'i tower pool.2. Rooms are being renovated. There was no noise concern, but definitely will be a cosmetic improvement, although all of our rooms were well maintained and very clean.3. Restaurants were a bit pricey on site.In conclusion, if I would came to Oahu again, I would definitely stay at the Ali'i tower at the HHV. Mahalo, Ali'i staff!P.S. In Maui, I recommend the Fairmont Kea Lani, the Westin or the Hyatt Regency. In Kaui, either the Hyatt or the Marriott. We are well travelled to the Hawaiian islands.

<Content>Nothing Special for price The HHV is a very giant hotel located on beautiful grounds and beach. HHV offers a little bit of everything, and other then the penguins, there is nothing that really stands out. The room rates are reasonable but there are a lot of extra charges, Parking, coffee, beach chairs, and the food is very pricey.The service is adequate but not outstanding.

<Content>Classic view of Waikiki and Diamond Head! We spent our last night in Waikiki before heading back to SF at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Upon check in I was told we had an ocean view room in the Rainbow Tower. However what we actually had was a room on the 3rd floor with a view of a gravel roof and a large tree. The ocean was out there but you can to squeeze into the corner of the balcony to see any of it.After phoning down and complaining (gently!) we were upgraded in a MAJOR way to the 27th floor, a corner room with 2 balconies, one facing the yacht harbor and downtown, and the other with a dead-on gorgeous view of Waikiki and Diamond Head. It had to be the most stunning view I've ever had from a hotel, anywhere. When the Friday night fireworks went off, we were eye level on our balcony. I told my husband I could've singed my hair, they were so close.The resort itself is as it bills itself..a village...great for a million distractions for children, or shoppers. I don't normally like this busy of an atmosphere, but I knew what to expect and it was fine. The pool is gorgeous, the beach is beautiful and RIGHT THERE.The food was so-so...and the breakfast we had sent up to the room was pretty terrible. Save your money and go out somewhere decent. YUK! Gummy bagel, un-eatable turkey bacon and lousy coffee.But, that view made up for any other minor complaints...just make sure you're getting what you paid for.

<Content>Loved It! For never visiting Hawaii and planning a honeymoon in such a short time, I was nervous about choosing the best hotel. I could not have been more pleased when the airport shuttle dropped me off at this paradise hotel. It really has everything you could ask for from nightly poolside shows to penguins and hula lessons. The Hilton is great for kids and perfect for honeymooners because it's about a block down the beach from Waikiki central, so it's a bit more secluded. The Hilton's beach and pool were so perfect. The rooms were equally as perfect as the grounds. I guess the beds could have been a tad more comfortable, but I am not complaining, being there was paradise.

<Content>Rest, Relaxation, and Courtesy Father and I ventured for the first time to Oahu. The hotel was splendid we stayed in the Lagoon Tower. It was a frenetic Thanksgiving but we definitely enjoyed the daily activities.Having the shops and restaurants there in the evening made the choice for dining very simple. We found many boisterous patron moments in the early afternoon by the pool-quite a diverse group of travelers by the pool. We had a wonderful time meeting vacationers from across the world. The property was immaculate and the convenience of the location made every venture to Waikiki very easy. The Village Steak House and the Rainbow Lanai Rooms were fabulous. The prices, although not inexpensive, were reasonable for the quality of food received.The parking service was tremendously helpful in locating daily off the beaten path tour destinations as well as the more tourist oriented ones that round out such a vacation. Providing the directions was never a problem for any employee. The staff were always willing to accomodate and assist in ensuring for a very relaxing, restful and enjoyed vacation.Can't wait until we visit next Thanksgiving. We are already booked.

<Content>Great For Young Families We stayed at the HHV Nov 11-18, 2004 in the Tapa Tower, 23rd floor with our two children ages 4  7. Paid $200 per night. We were very pleased with all aspects of the hotel. Service was courteous and timely. Room was fine, partial ocean view. The grounds were lovely... fish, penguins, turtles, birds, lush vegetation. Nice shops. The super pool and beach access were very nice. The beach area was quieter and better groomed than that further east... Waikiki. Parking was easy (but cost $12/night).We usually ate breakfast/brunch across the street at the Waialana Coffee Shop... inexpensive, but good food. We ate dinner at various locations around Honolulu... family friendly restaurants. We would go sight-seeing each day and then return to the hotel for fun in the water. The kids got a kick out of the evening hula show and torch lighting... though it may not be as entertaining for adults. We did not want our vacation to end!Chaise lounge rentals ($22/day) and beach umbrella rentals ($10/day, if I remember right) were kinda' high, we thought... so we did not partake. There were many restaurants on the premises... but too expensive for us.I would definitely recommend this hotel to families with young children. We hope to return in the future! I think it's a much nicer hotel than many of the cheesy ones along Waikiki beach. Easier to park, quieter, less hustle and bustle.

<Content>parents with kids beware just got back from thanksgiving with my 5  9 year old kids, we were asked to leave pool near spa because the kids were to loud, so we left back to our room as asked and called manager who said the pool was for all guests of our tower, when i took the boys towels back, there were other kids playing water polo in the pool where we were asked to leave. I asked to speak to spa mgr and as i was trying to ask why my kids were asked to leave, when he bolted off to kick the new group out of the pool. I assumed he was new I hope . but as I was catching the elevator he reappeared and said he would call security as this was just to much for the moron to handle. we always wanted to stay at the village but would definately not stay there again,we were staying for ten days but after being treated like a criminal we flew to the big island to kona and had the vacation I paid for. DONT TAKE KIDS no ALOHA!

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian Honeymoon We visited the HHV for 8nts in June for the 2nd part of our honeymoon. It was my 1st visit to the USA and I have to say was a little disappointed. We were honeymooners and qualified for a room upgrade with a sea view which apparently we received. We were on the top floor on the Rainbow Tower overlooking the lagoon - we had hoped for a view of Waikiki. The room was OK, but a bit old fashioned.Food and drink wise - not at all expensive. We are from England so same as prices over here really. Mai Tai's in Tapa Bar are lovely but lethal! Pizza place is good and open late. Tropics Beach Bar also good but closes at 9pm! If you want it a bit more lively at night then head for the Shore Bird at the Outrigger Reef on the Beach. The food and atmosphere there is great. Try the Cheesecake Factory too, so long as you don't mind a 90min wait for a table - worth it though.All in all, the hotel was good. If we went to Hawaii again I think I would stay here again, although I would pay the extra and stay in the Ali Tower and receive the luxury I was expecting on this visit.

<Content>Among the best My wife and i stayed at HHV in November and i like so many others read good and bad about the resort. We had the best time i have had at an all in one resort. The food was great,the service fantastic and the ambiance sensational. We stayed in the Kalia tower and the rooms were five star. We travel each year and stay at the best hotels ,i took a chance with this one because of the mixed reviews but it was worth it. My wife and i have planned three weeks there next year.

<Content>Great time at the HHV #1I appreciate people taking the time to write reviews because the comments I read prior to go to Oahu were very helpful. So this is a thank you for all of you who take your valuable time to share comments. Intially I was going to save money by staying at a less expensive hotel. Then decided to enjoy myself and that was a stupendous idea but it made the difference from an ok trip to a really lovely trip. Had a great stay at the HHV. Luckily it was not so crowded. Must be crazy in high season. Stayed in the Diamond Head Tower and it was acceptable for the rate I was paying (corporate rate) It is probably one of the older towers on the property. It is a little old e.g. the carpet is a bit wornish but very clean and comfortable and quiet. I do think in high season it would have been not quite as peaceful. Next time I would prefer to stay in another tower. Really liked staying on the beach and I liked being in the Village environment. There were plenty of chairs at the pool and the beach was not crowded ( again not high season). Thanks to the advice on this web site I ate breakfast across the street away from the Village and it was only about $7.00. Good breakfast. Loved walking..walking..walking.. thought sandals would do but for walking thank goodness I brought tennis shoes. If I had not brought .. no prob... stores are plentiful to buy anything. ABC stores are plentiful bought sodas, toothpaste, tee shirts,etc. I did not use the entertainment center in the room too much for sodas , coffee, etc.. what also I thought ridiculous is if you use the entertainment center you are charged an additional $1.50 for it to be restocked. That is the responsibility of the hotel. But that is minor complaint. I just did not use it and that took care of that peeve, but I still think it is silly. The view from the room was top of trees but that was ok because I was not in the room much. If I were with a special someone I would def want an ocean view. I do suggest a room high enough not to hear noise from the pool, trucks, vans, etc. I was on floor 7 and that was ok. I would prefer a higher floor. Liked staying at the end of the beach and not in the center of the high activity. Easy to walk or ride the bus. Visited the AZ and that is a must. Looking forward to a return trip and want to visit the Big Island and return to Oahu and will prob stay at the HHV again. I had a great time and it was a wonderful break from a hectic schedule. I used to think that the people who loved Hawaii had never traveled much and had limited frame of reference. I have rethought that concept because I have traveled to many countries and found Hawaii to be a wonderful place as well.

<Content>Ali' Tower, Honeymooners, Great Stay My husband and I stayed at the Ali' Tower and had the time of our lives. We were there in early June. This was the beat vacation we have ever had. We were suspose to be in the Kali' Tower but got upgraded for free and paid a very small cost to upgrade a little bit more. We were in the 6 star hotel with a doorman at the door that always had a smile on his face. Especially the man there at night. They were friendly but left us alone. Perfect for a couple on thier honeymoon. We had a ocean view room of the village and the ocean. We got up every morning at sat on our balcony. The food was a little pricey but well worth our trip. My husband loved the pizza there. You need to try it if you are there. He loves pizza and said that it is the best that he had ever had. The only problem we had was that we had double beds in our room. The view, service and that it was our honeymoon did not make it a big deal at all with us. This was the best week of our lives. We would go back there in a minute.

<Content>Awesome ! We stay at the HHV almost every year. In fact we are leaving the mainland on 12/4/04 for our second stay there this year. Bringing the kids and grand-kids and looking forward to another awesome adventure.Always enjoy the ocean front rooms in the Tapa Tower or in the Penthouse Lagoon Tower.

<Content>Stay away from the Diamond Tower I did not like this hotel at all. TOO BIG and spread out. The Diamond Tower was horrid with only a partial ocean view from my room. After check-in I was given a map and sent away. I had to ask to be pointed in the right direction, and I still needed help finding my room as there was a function going on. Let鈥檚 not forget the ants, ants, and more ants, they were everywhere in my room. The room size was ok, but it could use a face-lift. If I can help it, I would not stay there again, at least not this tower. The Village area is ok, tourist traps for sure. The beach was fine, but it would have been nice to have comp beach chairs as a guest of the hotel. The food was just ok, with blah service. Clearly, the key to this hotel is to be in an upgraded room or tower or something deluxe. It is too far to travel from the East Coast to only have a lack luster room. Thank goodness my stay was a short one!

<Content>If you can't stay in the Royal Hawaiian - the HHV is next best place We stayed in the Kalia Tower 3 nights in late October) and were most pleased with the location of our room (23rd floor - overlooking the Rainbow Tower, Lagoon and gorgeous pacific ocean). Our room was beautifully furnished - every amenity was available. We were lucky we stayed on a club floor - great continental breakfast, coffee/refreshments and daytime snacks, and evening appetizers - ready when you are and available on the 25th floor. We paid $275/night which I believe is the going rate for high ocean view/club floor in the Kalia Tower. We usually stay at the Royal Hawaiian and as nice as the HHV was -I was happy when at last it was time to move on down the road to the Royal Hawaiian. The moment we arrived at the RHH - felt that our vacation had now truly begun. Either way - both hotels are great and Waikiki as busy as it is - is a wonderful place to just kick back and relax.

<Content>Hawaiian Village Not for Toddlers We cancelled reservations at the W and changed our one-night stay in Oahu to the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki because it was supposedly a child-friendly hotel. The hotel may be friendly to children above 5, but it was NOT toddler friendly. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by a very unfriendly bellhop that took all of our bags -- including our diaper bag. I specifically asked if it would take long for our bags to be delivered to the room and was told it wouldn't take long.When we arrived in our room, it was nice and clean, but we had someone else's luggage in the room. We called the front desk and it was picked up right away. But, we waited approximately 2 hours for our luggage to be delivered. (Our diaper bag with diapers, toys, snacks and etc. -- almost 2 hrs. to be delivered.) My husband called several times to find out where our luggage was and were told it's on it's way.We also asked for a crib when reservations were made, when we checked in, and with three calls to the front-desk. A portable playpen was delivered approximately 5 hrs after check-in. (Not even a sheet to cover the bottom of playpen was provided.) We called housekeeping and explained that our 18-month old was too tall to sleep in a playpen -- his body length is much longer than the width of the playpen. We were told sorry.We went down and spoke to the manager on duty and were told a playpen was all they could provide. But, if we had requested a crib earlier in the day, we could have arranged a rental. (We told the manager we asked four times for the crib and no one mentioned that all they had were playpens, but we were greeted with a blank look.)Though we booked a king-size bed room, we were given a room with double-beds. I spent my first night in Hawaii awake the majority of the time trying to make sure our son didn't fall out of the bed. (My husband had to sleep in the other double-bed.)The rest of the grounds were nice, the staff somewhat friendly, but not stroller friendly and my son did find the remains of a very dead bird outside the pizza restaurant. (On-site restaurants convenient, but over priced.)We'll try the hotel again after our son is over five, but we will not go back to the Hilton Hawaiian Village until he's atleast that old. (When we returned home, I sent an email letter to Hilton complaining about stay and received an email back from Hawaiian Village Manager saying that they'd look into our problems and look at their policies.)

<Content>Better than expected Just returned from a 2 week honeymoon to Oahu and the Big Island. Stayed at the HHV the 1st three nights. Positives:--paid $205 for partial ocean view. Got upgraded to 24th floor of Rainbow Tower, corner room with views of Diamond Head on one side and the harbor on the other. The view was awesome, best of all the places we stayed. I think we were upgraded b/c I'm a HHonors diamond member and it was our honeymoon.--ABC store is great! Drinks and snacks in the room keep costs down. My wife also bought some reasonably priced souvenirs. --Grounds are cool. Pink Flamingos, penguins, greenery, etc.--Service better than expected.--Best and roomiest beach on Waikiki 鈥?and we walked all the way to Diamond Head.Negatives:--HUGE Cockroach in room. Released it to the 鈥渨ild鈥?and no other problems. It was HUGE!--Better be an early riser to get a spot at the pool. --We were directed to order drinks from the waitresses poolside, instead of ordering at the bar. Kind of took a while, wished we could have gone up at our convenience.--Place is big. A little overwhelming when checking in late at night after a long flight.Advise:--Take a Taxi to and from the airport, avoid the Waikiki shuttle. You only spend a couple of extra bucks, but it is SO much more convenient! We had to wait an extra 陆 hour while they loaded the thing up (this was after a 9 hour flight 鈥?we just wanted to get there!). We took a taxi on the way back and it allowed us to spend more time on the beach and have less headaches! (Waikiki Shuttle is totally independent of HHV).

<Content>Great Service/Room in Ali Tower If you must stay in Oahu, the HHV Ali Tower is the way to go if you like large/megaresorts. My husband and I visited Nov.5-6th and 19th-20th on the way to/from Sydney to shorten our flight from Texas. We knew the hotel was extremely large, but we were not wanting to leave the property in our short stays - so we very much wanted everything at our disposal. We are blessed to travel extensively despite our young ages of 28/32 and stay in only 4 and a half or 5 star hotels. The Ali Tower is the way to go here. We had booked a partial o.view vs. the full o.view in order to overlook the Super Pool, Beach, and Fri.night show. We requested a high floor and on the end closest to the beach. Our requests were granted with both stays and we thus became Hilton Honors members for we were impressed with all of the great service. The Ali tower has it's own gym ($12 to use the main gym in Kalia Tower) and pool. The room was very large as well as the bathroom. Even had a mini TV. We never heard ANY noise on either stay despite the Ali Tower being at almost full capacity. We did not rent a car, so no parking fees. Just took a taxi to/from airport - only $25 each way and took 25-30minutes with traffic. The reception desk in Ali was great, no line EVER! We did the bounceback package advertised on their website and received free brk. in Rainbow Lanai - wonderful! The pool area was quite crowded for November, but inside the Super Pool and on the Beach were not crowded. We already knew the food was expensive. We only ate at the Tropics Beach Cafe - 2 hamburgers, 2 fries, and 2 alcholic beverages for $41.00. We were given a slightly later check out of Noon upon request and then a hospitality room for 40 mins. before our flight. We did the Pearl Harbour tour with E Noa tours on our last day and it was great - highly recommend this company and our driver/guide - Bob. Overall great experience if you don't mind a lot of people around. I would say if you want to experience the real Hawaii, go to Kauai and Maui - our personal favorite places on earth. Oahu is just a big city but our flight to Sydney was from there and wanted to visit Pearl Harbour. Plus the HHV offered great room, entertainment, and shopping. I originally was going to book the Kahala Mandarin outside of town, but being that we would be there on both occassions for such a short time, figured we needed to stay closer to the airport and wanted to see Waikiki Beach for I doubt we'll ever return to Oahu, unless flying through to another vacation destination.

<Content>Loved It....Plus Some Tips to Avoid the Problems My trip was through American Airlines Vacations and I couldn't have been happier with their service -- or the Hilton's. My package came with a free upgrade to Ali'i Tower, which was important to me because I wanted the added amenities I'd heard about. Made sure to have AA fax the hotel to guarantee that tower and let them know we were celebrating an anniversary (5th), so we wanted to ensure the ocean view that we were to get with the package.AA Vacations met us at the airpoirt with a lei greeting and instructed us to check in at the kiosk while waiting for our bags to be transported to the bus. I worried that I wouldn't get the same attention (there was just a lady there to help guide me through self check-in). Instead, I was the only one there and she took extra time to make sure I was in the Ali'i tower and had the room I wanted. Handed me not only our room keys right there, but also the bar key and all the resort info. This kiosk is fairly new, but anyone staying at the hotel can use it and should to avoid the lines.The bus dropped us in the transportation area and, when I told the bellman we'd already checked in at the airport and had our keys, he pointed the way directly to our tower and promptly took our luggage. I was excited to see our room and also relieved. On the quiet side (Diamond Head), which in this tower overlooks Fort DeRussey park, the beach and ocean. Within about 5 mins. the bellman called to make sure we were in our room and was there within minutes with our bags.Ali'i Tower is great, especially for the unlimited free coffee and bottled water and lavish rooms. Ours was very quiet. The only complaint was that, because we were on the fourth floor, we couldn't see Diamond Head from the lanai. I thought the complimentary hors d'oeuvres were overrated but they were very popular with the other guests. I did enjoy that tower's private pool, deck, bar and hot tub. Also, since that tower has its own concierge and front desk, they are very attentive and there's rarely a wait for these services.Once when we'd inadvertently left the Do Not Disturb button on all day while on a trip to the Big Island, I was disappointed to return after 9pm to find my room hadn't been serviced. Though the maids come by three times daily for anything from full service to coffee and ice replinishment, they will NOT disturb you if the button on the door indicates privacy (they slide a note under the door). To my surprise, they sent a team of two women up at nearly 10pm and did everything we asked -- new sheets, towels, vaccuming -- while we waited on the lanai. I was impressed. Another time, we needed more coffee, at night no less, and they brought it right up at no charge.Though originally scheduled for seven nights, we didn't want to leave and decided to extend our stay by two nights. Because they were nearly sold out and couldn't keep us in the same room, the Ali'i front desk manager gave us several choices in various towers -- from an Ali'i room with no view to a Deluxe Oceanfront in the Rainbow Tower. We chose to see what that one would be like and they gave us a $345/night room for $275/night since they were asking us to move. It was seamless. They gave us a late check-out until the new room was ready, so we lounged at the pool until they took our bags from one room to the next.Now for the differences. We had a corner room in the Rainbow Tower in the 21st floor. To say the views were spectacular doesn't cover it. Sunrise with downtown, Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach from one lanai and sunset, with the ocean, harbor and western mountains off the second lanai. The downsides: room never really cooled down with the large windows even with drapes pulled during the daytime due to an outdated cooling system (the one in Ali'i was digital and blasted cold air at our touch). Rooms and tower are not as quiet and are older, as are the elevators (which are very crowded), halls, etc. Bathrooms -- unlike the marble ones in Ali'i -- maybe rival what you'd find at a Holiday Inn (Express) and there are NO extra amenities. They charge for the coffee, water, everything. Also, because the front desk serves multiple towers (all but Ali'i), there can be a wait if you need something there. Here you are really paying for the view. All in all, I wouldn't have wanted to spend all nine nights in this tower, but we really enjoyed the ability to savor that view for two days. In the future, I'd still do Ali'i instead, but push for a higher up room for a more complete view.The day we (finally) checked out, we had a hospitality suite, which was nice even though they gave us a key to a room that was already occupied. Luckily we just walked in on their open suitcase on the bed and not on the inhabitants themselves. We had to walk all the way back to the front desk to get another key, but in return they gave us added time in the room and told us just to call them when we left and leave the key in the room.Other things to be aware of when visiting, especially if it's your first time at HHV: As mentioned, drinks and food are expensive, but if you want the luxury of pina coladas by the pool, that's what you can expect. I found drinks weren't all that much less outside the hotel, but food was less. At Hilton, we ate at Village Steak House (courtesy of a $50 dining credit that was part of our package) and Benihana and enjoyed both, but we were also prepared for the bill when we went. Go to the coffee house across the street for a great, inexpensive breakfast like all you can eat pancakes and coffee for $4.99, but get there before 9am or you'll wait on the sidewalk to get in. Skip lunch if you can while you have a drink or two by the pool (or have the free appetizers if you're in Ali'i) then go offsite for dinner. Many restaurants, including some at HHV, have Sunset Specials between 5-6pm and you can get a great deal even at high-end locales. Also, the on-site ABC is a lifesaver for in-room snacks, including sodas, beer, wine and other goodies. Most rooms have at least a mini fridge so it's a great cost saver.I can't stress enough that if you're NOT in Ali'i and have to rely only on the Super Pool, that you do have to get down there by 8:30am to be among the first in if you want a louge chair. Also, if you leave for awhile and try to save your chair with just a towel, the poolside spotters will pick up the towels and you lose your seat. If you must leave for a quick bite or run to your room, leave a paperback book or some sandals on your chair -- we never had a problem doing that. They have to enforce it to be fair, but if you're planning to party at night and sleep in late, you can just expect to head to the beach because all the pool chairs are taken by 9am. We're early risers, so this wasn't a problem. Note also that the vendors on the beach charging to rent lounge chairs, rafts, etc. are NOT Hilton employees. They are not trying to gouge their guests (at least not on the beach). This is a public beach and you'll find those types of stands all the way down Waikiki so I'm always surprised when people on this board complain about that practice in front of HHV.Also, the free torch-lighting show each night was nice -- I recommend catching that over the big Friday Show, which was disappointing. You will wait in line to pay $10 for a hand stamp to get in and that will score you ONE drink per person, whether it's soda or a mai tai. And that's even for Standing Room Only. Alcoholic drinks by the pool during the day, or in other bars at night, are less than $10 so this isn't a value. The show was just an extended version of the one that is performed every night without the drink charge and the crowds. We also RAN up to our room at the end to enjoy the fireworks so we could benefit from the view. I can honestly say that if you blink you'll miss them! Maybe it was that one night, but literally less than five were blown off and it was over. From the 21st floor, we could hear people on the beach screaming, Is that it? If you want a show go to a luau instead (we loved the one at Paradise Cove) and wait for the 4th of July if you want fireworks. : )All in all, we loved the Village atmosphere and the feeling of luxury and relaxation we felt, especially as guests in the Ali'i Tower. We saw no signs of renovation or wear in that building or in our room, as another reviewer mentioned, but if you're concerned you should fax ahead to the hotel and request a renovated room. I also recommend that if you eat off-property, utilize either the Ali'i Concierge or the AmEx Travel Service desk in the Rainbow Tower lobby. They really have connections. With every dinner reservation they made for us, we had the BEST table in the restaurant (while others waited a long time for lesser seating) and were treated like VIPs. It really makes a difference in the experience.Most of all, remember you're there to treat yourself if you're at HHV, so go for the best and you'll get what you pay for. If you try to do it on the cheap, you'll be disappointed. I'm sure due to its size, other smaller properties may have superior service (Halekulani), but their standard non-view room rates are generally more than HHV's Ali'i Tower rooms and you don't get the more isolated end of the beach or the beautiful grounds and premium location away from crowded Waikiki. Those are HHV's greatest assets.I suggest do it right at the Hilton your first time to Honolulu and find ways while you're there to save money the next time you go back (lots of condos with kitchenettes can be rented for less than $200/night if you know where to look). We miss what became our beautiful Island home and can't wait to return! Aloha.

<Content>I mught as well have had a smoking room afterall I recently stayed at the Hilton for 7 nights. In a deluxe Ocean View room in the Rainbow tower. Whilst my room was big and spacious and the view excellent the walls were so thin I could hear my neighbours the whole time. Also my room was a non smoking room however the room next door was not and whenever someone in that room happened to be smoking the smell came into my room under the gap in a connecting door. I really can't see why the whole floor wasn't non smoking and not just certain rooms on each floor.

<Content>Hilton - Just Disappointing We just got back from the spending one week at HHV in Oahu in the Rainbow Tower for our honeymoon. We spent one week at the Ritz in Maui before heading out to Oahu. I called the Hilton before departing Maui to remind them that I would be arriving in their hotel in the afternoon and we had requested a high floor in the Rainbow Tower with an ocean view room (based on the reviews I read on this website) and reminded them that it was our honeymoon. When we got their, first Go-Go travel lost one of our suitcases (which was not the Hilton's fault). The bell man had a major attitude (which I really didn't want to deal with after finding out that my Go-Go had lost our bag.) Then we proceeded to wait on line to check in for about 40 mintues. Once I got to the front desk I reminded them again that I had called earlier and we are honeymooners. To make a long story short, I get up to the room to find 2 twin beds. I immediately called the front desk and they were unwilling to change the room, saying that they don't gurantee bedding. After a long argument they were able to find a king bed on the 30th floor. But of course they asked me to stand on line again which was way longer then the 40 minute line I was previously on. Overall, I was very disappointed with the stay. The only good thing about our stay was the views from our room of the ocean and diamond head. We ate at the Golden Dragon and the woman that served us was a snob. After that we decided we would eat outside of the hotel. We didn't mind paying the prices in the hotel resturants which are very much like New York, we just felt we should get good service for those prices. We walked over to the Halekulani and realized we had made a big mistake by selecting Hilton for our stay. I am a HHonors member and will never go back to a Hilton. The problem is the hotel is way to big to offer good personalized service which is what honeymooners look for. Next time going back to Maui and will skip Oahu.

<Content>Ali'i Tower Upon arrival noted that the rooms were beginning to show their age. Carpet was stained and furniture had scratches. Hilton saw this as well I guess because next day I noticed that they were removing all the furnishings from the 4th and 5th floor. They have upgraded the a/c thermostats to wireless digital and mine quit working in the middle of the night. Serviceman told me they were having some problems with these new devices. Stopped working again 15 minutes after he left. When straight to manager then and learned two other rooms had a/c problems as well. Management made appropriate adjustments on the spot. Have stayed there before, will stay there again; just be aware that it is upgrade the facilitites time at this part of the HHV.

<Content>Grounds Spectacular; Service only adequate If you are into mega-resorts, and don't care too much about spit-and-polish service this place is for you. Several well-kept pools, a huge array of restaurants, shopping and activities. The service is always given with a smile, but is detached, and rigid.As another poster mentioned, upgrades are not handed out freely - we are Hilton Diamond Level members, and couldn't even get a sniff of the Ali`i Tower. The junior suites in the Diamond Head tower are laid out in such a way that the sleeping area is in the front, with no windows or natural light, the sitting area is in the back toward the lanai. We stay there when we have points to spend (we live on Oahu, but we like an occasional visit to a beachside hotel), but if we are spending money, the Royal Hawaiian has superior service.

<Content>Perfect We stopped at this hotel from 6th October for 7 nights and got married at the hotel on the 6th night. We stayed in the Kalia Tower which has it鈥檚 own pool/sun terrace on the 4th floor (same floor was the fitness center and spa). The view of the village, lagoon, beach  sea was fantastic from our balcony. As this was our wedding/honeymoon we stayed in four different hotels on our trip and this was the best we stayed in. The gardens and wildlife located all around the hotel are brilliant. This is one hotel we would like to re-visit  recommend to friends. The hotel is located towards the quieter end of Waikiki beach, which we really enjoyed as it is only a short walk to the centre. We did eat evening meals in six of the restaurants and enjoyed the different styles of cuisine. Don't forget to use the restaurant/shop discount voucher book handed to you at check-in!Small criticisms would be that we had to pay a daily charge to use the in room safe, restaurants within the village can be on the expensive side, the Super Pool is suppose to be the largest pool in Waikiki but it isn鈥檛 really that big, small fee to access e-mail and receive faxes.

<Content>Talk about class! What an amazing place! My family and I went to the Hilton Village and stayed there for 4 days in August 2004. We were in the Alai Tower (excuse my misspelling!). This tower, so I hear, has the best service and VIP services of all the towers in the village. We had our own private pool/hot tub area on a private outdoor deck only for guests staying in that tower. It had a full bar along with nightly appetizers (cold and hot) and our own gym! The deck overlooked the beach as well as a view of the Hilton grounds. Shopping? Not a problem! We didn't ever have to leave the resort for great shopping with stores like Coach, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, cute little gift shops, tons of restaurants on-premise (everything from Sushi to sandwiches and fries). It was luxury at its finest with chocolates on the pillows, marble bathrooms with every amenity (including a mini TV so you can watch while getting ready for the day or for brushing your teeth at night!). I felt like royalty. The amazing views, food and services were extraordinary. Complete with penguins, coy ponds and exotic animals just feet from the hotel tower entrance the property is beautiful, clean and also very romantic! Definitely worth the extra money!

<Content>Wonderful Place to Stay!! My husband and I spent 7 nights at HHV, 10/1-10/8. We wanted to stay at a hotel that was close to where my brother and his family were staying, Hale Koa. HHV is right next door to it. So I decide to sign up for Hilton Honors. When I was booking the reservations on the phone, I mentioned that we had Hilton Honors and asked if we could get an upgrade when we checked in. (we booked a garden view room) The lady told us that mostly like no because we just enrolled and normally upgrades are given to those at highter Hilton Honors level. But she will place that request. We arrived at the hotel late (close to midnight). Our check-in lady was very friendly. She gave us our keys and told us that we were upgraded to a ocean view room in the Kalia tower (11th floor). My eyes immediately light up. I was surprised and happy. She asked us if we wanted the bell hop to take us to our tower, but we insisted that we walked to take the walk instead and enjoy the grounds. The hotel lobby is not that far from the tower. Once we got to our room, we were amazed at the decor. Our room was fabulous. I couldn't ask for anything more. From our balcony, we can see the pool, the village, the rainbow tower, tapa tower, lagoon tower, and the ocean. The view was great! The Kalia tower has it's own pool on the 4th floor (same floor was the fitness center and spa). The grounds were beautiful and clean. There is an ABC store on the grounds. We only ate at one restaurant, which was the Tapa Cafe. We went here for breakfast on our last day. It was pricey for an all you can eat breakfast. Other than that, HHV is a great place to stay. We are planning to stay here again when we come back in Aug '05.

<Content>Hilton OK Me and my wife came to the Hilton Hawaiian Village for our honeymoon for 7 nights. Although the Hilton Hawaiian Village is touted as being the best hotel in Honolulu, I beg to differ. First and foremost they did not upgrade our hotel room upon arrival despite the fact that I am a Hilton Honors customer. Second, to be perfectly honest I did not really like the entertainment, let me put it this way it wasn't too entertaining. My suggestion is to avoid the restaurants in the hotel, they are too expensive and not very good. The staff at the hotel are always looking for tips so I would avoid asking for too many amenities. The maids did clean our rooms regularly, which was a plus. Overall our trip wasn't too bad, but I definetly will not stay at the Hilton again.

<Content>Loved the Hilton I just returned from spending 4 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Oct. 7-11th. I really enjoy this hotel from the beautiful grounds, lovely beach, great shopping and the large variety of restaurants on property from expensive to Round Table pizza. There is something for everyone. I also enjoy the fireworks on Friday nights. We stayed in the ALIi tower and loved it with a great ocean view room. The room could use a slight remodel with new carpets and fabrics.

<Content>Amazing! We recently returned from a 10 night stay in Hawaii. We stayed at HHV for 5 of those, from 9/29-10/3. We had reserved a room in the Ali'i tower several months ago, luckily I checked the rates 10 days before we left and found a package deal that would give us 10,000 bonus HHoners points, a free spa bath robe, and a room upgrade if available, AND was $30 less per night than the previous reservation. So I cancelled our first reservation and re-booked this package. We were celebrating our 10th anniversary, so my husband faxed in a request to have a room on the 8th floor or higher with a view of Diamond Head (someone on Hawaii travel board suggested this). When we arrived, the girl that checked us in was very nice, I could tell she was taking her time reading everthing on her screen, she said she was trying to find us a great room, and she did. We were given a corner room on the 10th floor (1005, I believe). We had a wrap around balcony, with a great view of Diamond Head on one side and the ocean on the other. Needless to say we were thrilled. I enjoyed laying on the chaise lounge each night looking at the stars and listening to the waves. If you didn't want to you would not have to leave the property, there is everything from an ABC store to Louis Vuitton. The propery was beautiful and very clean. The Ali'i Tower has it's own hot tub and swimming pool, as well as fitness center. We did use the hot tub a lot, but I usually laid out by the Super Pool. Another advantage of the Ali'i Tower was the free appetizers 5-7, we did take advantage of this a couple of nights. We ate lunch at the resort a couple of times, and got pizza for dinner one night, but we did not eat at any of the restaurants although we had intentions to do so. Since it is a resort we knew the food prices would be steep and they were about $10 for a cheeseburger. We kept snack and breakfast foods as well as drinks in our room. Since we did not take advantage of the $100 Hilton Dollars timeshare offer to start with, we came in on the second day and had a nice invitation giving us $200 Hilton dollars if we would spend 90 minutes for the presentation. We did the tour, and I had fun spending the money. We can not imagine staying anywhere else the next time we are lucky enough to go to Hawaii, definitely spoiled on our first trip!

<Content>HHV - OK, but nothing to write home about. Food overpriced Stayed at the HHV for a conference, and took a few extra days to do some sightseeing around Oahu and the Big Island. The HHV is great for conferences, and has a wonderful location - right on the beach and handy for both Waikiki and Honolulu (I don't understand the criticisms of Waikiki being too far away - it is only a 5-minute walk from the HHV to the main shops in Waikiki).On the downside, though, the HHV felt very much like a theme park without the rides. Not the place for an authentic Hawaiian experience, but I guess you wouldn't come to Waikiki for that anyway. Charging for coffee in the room strikes me as penny-pinching in the extreme, and not a measure to inspire return visits. Food on-site was vastly over-priced and rather over-rated. CJ's deli was OK but expensive. Much better to go to the coffee shop over the road from the HHV, though the staff there are rather inattentive. Staff at HHV were OK, but I did continually get the feeling that they were doing me a favour by letting me stay there. Payed almost $3 for one of the worst cups of coffee I have ever had at the Tapa bar. Nightly entertainment was mainly fairly poor, and mostly unncessary - just serve good food and drink and allow people to soak up the atmosphere of being in Hawaii.

<Content>I would go back in a heartbeat We stayed in the kalia tower in July 04. It was 2 children and myself. The grounds of the hotel were superb. There was a lot to do and see in and around the hotel. Food was way over priced. I would recommend the coffee shop across the street from the hotel. All you can eat pancakes for $4.00. The super pool was always crowded but the tower we stayed in had its on swimming pool that was perfect on the rooftop of our tower. The kids enjoyed swimming there. Beach was awesome we never had a problem finding a spot. Staff was always very friendly. We loved the hotel, worth the extra money to be right on the beach. I 'd stay there again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Hilton Stay O.K. We stayed at Hilton for 4 nights for the last part of our honeymoon in September. We had a huge room in the Ali Towerand a giant wrap around balcony over the roof of a lobby(and some penguins!). The Ali Tower has private access to the Ali Tower pool. This was nice since we really didn't want to be near screaming kids and a ton of families at the main pool. We did not get upgraded and the hotel was definitely not full. This was our 3rd trip to Hawaii and I thought the hotel overall was O.K. Too busy and overstimulating for my tatse. I love Oahu... there is so much to do and beautiful beaches on the North Shore(must go there). Make sure this hotel is what you are looking for. The service was good and staff was helpful. No major problems just not what we were looking for.

<Content>Loved Hawaii My first trip to Oahu, Hawaii, we stayed their for 4 days and then 2 weeks on the big Island. In Honolulu we had a very small studio, no ice at all in the tower we were in, washers and dryers out of order, however after that first night, we notified the Hilton Hawaiian vacation club and they were kind enough to move us to a 1 bedroom, very very beautiful, spacious, and a great view of Waikiki beach. The best vaction of my life, LOVED Hawaii.

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian Village is great!!! My husband and I just returned from a 9 night stay at the HHV. We were there 9/9/-9/18. We had no problems with check-in, Alii tower has its own front desk. We stayed in an ocean view room in the Alii' Tower. The room was great, and it had a great lanai. There is maid service 3 times a day, and the Alii tower has its own pool for Alii guests only. The private pool was the best part, the super pool is too crowded. In regards to the food, there is many restaraunts to choose from on the property. My husband and I are picky eaters, and didn't care for some of the restaraunts. A few of the restaraunts we tried were: The Golden Dragon-Chinese,Sergios-Italian, and Hatsuhana-Japanese. They were all ok, I was just not impressed. There's the Wailana coffee shop across the street, this no frills restaraunt is great for good tasting breakfast at a cheap price. Lunch we had by the pool, RoundTable Pizza, Hamburgers etc...We usually ventured outside of the hotel for dinner. 3660 on the rise is an excellent restaraunt, the concierge can make the reservations. Also, the Cheesecake Factory on Kalakaua St. is good. The weather in Honolulu was wonderful, occasional showers but that's normal in Hawaii. Overall, the Hilton Hawaiian Village is a great place to stay when in Honolulu.

<Content>Treated like royality at Kalia Towers Executive Floors Stayed in the Kalia Tower Executive Floors which are the top floors of the tower giving wonderfulviews. Our room was beautifully decorated withlots of nice little extra touches but thanks mustgo to Marcus Nikora and the staff of theexecutive lounge where we ate breakfast andsnacks throughout the day. They were justsuperb in looking after ever guest, nothing wastoo much trouble.Highly recommend this section of the Hotelwhich has its own pool.

<Content>All In All We loved the hotel but..... Well it certainly has the best spot in the resort. My husband and I spent a week at the HHV having been to Vegas and we wished we'd spent our whole 2 weeks in Hawaii. Don't know why there are reviews complaining about paying for the coffee in the room - we had coffee and didnt pay! The rooms are lovely and spacious. We awoke to a horrible drilling noise the first morning we were there (works going on in the spa) and the duty manager moved us to the 20th floor of our tower without any problems at all and gave us a complimentary breakfast. The buffet was disappointing and somewhat expensive - we paid around 拢30 for a plate of salad and a lukewarm curry! Benihana is well worth a visit and is a lot cheaper than the one in London. I have read a lot of complaints about the prices of food - its a huge resort so venture out and eat in Waikiki itself - we only had 2 meals in the hotel but had wonderful meals elsewhere with Bubba Gumps, Red Lobster and the Cheesecake Factory a short walk away. There is a fab ABC store onsite that sells snacks and drinks at really reasonable prices too.Staff at the hotel were lovely and it is a truely beautiful hotel with its gardens, flamingos and even penguins - oh and make sure you go to the sealife centre and swim with the dolphins when you are there - i would recommend this hotel to anyone - you get what you pay for and coming from the UK we are used to paying high prices so HHV wasnt that pricy really. We are already planning our next visit.

<Content>troubles in paradise My family and friends recently stayed 7 nights at HHV. Very slow check in and check out, even for a Diamond level status with Hilton Honors. One room was infested with ants, staff tried to rationalize that this is a tropical environment. Insects remained throughout stay as staff unable to move both rooms to a different floor. Ice machine was not functioning for several days, billing issues with restaurants (expensive too!), communications appear to be an issue. Requested manager but only able to communicate through staff. Property is beautiful but problems with staff nagged throughout the stay. Totally unexpected for a resort property.

<Content>Disneyland of Ohau This hotel is a very nice. It truly is its own village within Honolulu. Plenty of shopping, and restaurants. The Bali restaurant far exceeds any restaurant within the hotel. The food is fabolous!!! The beach and the pool are nice and everyone is helpful in booking any reservations. This is a great family hotel to bring children too.

<Content>If you're single, be forewarned, it's familyland. No nightlife! I just stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for a week on business. This is truly a family resort, not a good place for any singles looking to mingle. We went down to Duke's or the Outrigger down the beach for bars. Everything around this place shuts down by 10:00 or 11:00PM. Don't get me wrong, the rooms are nice with good views, but the food is all overpriced, and Parking is expensive. When we were checking in, I found the staff at the front desk rude, in fact, the woman helping my colleague walked away for 5-10 minutes during her check in without saying anything. If you decide to stay here, bring your Visa/MC/Amex and Discover, you'll need it. Oh, and lot's of one or five dollar bills, as everyone has their hand out for a tip.

<Content>Loved the Ali'i Tower My wife and I wanted to visit Honolulu for 2 days on our way back from Maui. I booked the HHV using my Am. Exp. Platinum card travel services. It cost $260/night with free daily breakfast for 2 and one free lunch. It was a wonderful room (#602) Ali'i Tower: Large, great full view of the ocean with the Hilton pier, robes, slippers, compartmental bathroom, complimentary tropical fruit tray, orchid on the bed after the bed is turned down for the night, ice in the bucket before you even check in, EVERY employee was friendly (without being obnoxious), pool and gym for Ali'i Tower only, huge Koi ponds, penguins (!).The place is huge and you may not feel like leaving the premises (which is probably good for families with children). We are a young couple but did not feel cramped by the crowds or children. I can鈥檛 comment on the other towers but the Ali鈥檌 room was so nice we didn鈥檛 leave the room on the first day except to go for lunch and dinner. We just sat out on the lanai reading or admiring the beauty of the beach and water. The furniture was not outdated and I would recommend the hotel to anyone.

<Content>Hilton- nice, but not great We had a 3 night stay in the rainbow tower this August, room 928. It was a corner room/ king bed with 2 balconies over-looking the grounds in one direction and the pool/beach in the other. It was very clean and a great room. Got in through costco travel at a lower that the advertised internet rate. I would definitely recommend the rainbow tower over the others and I would also request a room no lower than the 9th floor. The beach is crowded in front of the Hilton but the area just to the left of the Hilton is a public park and very nice. The pool closes very early so they can put on a cheesy hawaiian show by the pool. I would rather have the pool stay open. The place is packed with families, mostly Japanese, so forget a romantic and quiet spot, but waikiki is not a romantic place in general.  Definitely eat off property, too costly otherwise.  They have a abc store in the village which is very convenient and reasonable. Staff is not overly friendy, but meets the minimum for service.Overall, a good place to stay if you have to go to waikiki.

<Content>It was just what we wanted! We spent two nights at the HHV on 8/17-8/18, and had a wonderful time. Traveling with our 8 year old son, my husband and I were looking to relax by the pool, on the beach and in the room - we wanted a hotel that was self-contained and did not want to be wandering around Oahu this time. HHV was perfect for that!We staggered up to the check-in desk and must have looked so pathetically jetlagged that we got upgraded from a garden-view room to an ocean view room on the 8th floor of the Rainbow Tower. Fabulous location! Gorgeous view, close to the beach and pools. Even easy to get across the street to the ABC store, Round TAble Pizza and Lappert's Ice Cream...We had the buffet at the Rainbow Tower for breakfast - pretty pricey and definitely skewed toward Asian tastes (ie, no oatmeal, but rice). I would agree that the hotel is definitely geared to serve Asian families..guessing that 75% of the guests were from Japan.I was (naively?) surprised to see LOTS of people smoking everywhere. UGH.Great shave ice at the little stand on the beach just past Tropics Bar and Grill (where we ate a decent not exorbitant lunch)A real plus is the beautiful beach. Gentle waves, very kid friendly and calm, just a little stronger in the aft for budding boogie-boarders. We were in the water every chance we got.If I was looking just to settle in at a hotel on Waikiki and save the sightseeing for another island, I would definitely pick HHV again!

<Content>Home away from home We went twice to Oahu this summer June 26 to July 7, 2004. Brought the whole family including 2 grand children. We didn't know what to do first day,we had the Rainbow Tower and 3 rooms all on different floors which turned out well..we had a great time and the grand children still talk about it.The only bad thing was at the Village Seafood and Steak house they forgot to bring the grand childrens food we ordered which kids eat free with parents and the wait was long enough so poor babies went back to the room all fussy and just got them a hot dog at the Tapa pool.The Super Pool is crowded no chairs all day available. The ABC store has lots of snacks 24 hrs a day, very crowded in there.......small store.So me and the husband went back by ourselves Aug 12 to Aug 20 got upgraded to the Tapa Tower it was better then the Rainbow Tower we had a great view the room was very big....we enjoyed the lounges at night I agree they should keep the Super Pool open till very late 11pm . I did see a few people go in after hours any way.. The Tapa Tower Pool they keep open late but its small...we had again a nice time...My vacations in Hawaii and staying at the Hilton goes much to fast.....but guess what were gonna go back with the whole family again next summer were planing to stay another 2 weeks,,,,,,,,ALOHA

<Content>Couldn't Ask for Anything More My husband and I stayed at the Hilton between Aug. 11 and Aug. 15 and had a wonderful time. Upon checkin we were upgraded to an oceanview room in the Tapa tower and also given free breakfast for each day of our stay at the Rainbow Lanai for being Hilton Honors members. The room was nice, the view breathtaking and the hotel grounds so much fun to explore. The eating options onsite are overpriced but we did eat at the Golden Dragon and it was very good but overall I would advise others to look elsewhere for food. There is a great coffee shop across the street from the Kalia tower that has reasonable prices and excellent food. Also if you walk just a few blocks from the hotel you will find tons of inexpensive chains and fast food places. Just a warning though...if you are looking for a quiet, laid back vacation you might want to avoid this place. Its very busy and crowded and overflowing with families with small children. It didn't bother us at all but I could see where some people could find the HHV less than relaxing.

<Content>Great family trip We just returned from a 6 night stay at the HHV with our two boys 5 and 8 yrs. old and it will not be our last visit. We had a wonderful time and it is a great property for families. My husband is a Hilton Honors member and it narrowed down our selection process. We were upgraded to a Jr. suite in the Diamond Head tower with a huge patio (you could have a party of 15ppl on it) overlooking the ocean and side beach area. We had a king bed with separate full living area and fold out sofa. We spent every evening just sitting out on our patio while our boys slept listening to the waves and looking at the stars. The staff was very accomodating in all aspects. The penguins, fish and birds were a huge hit with my boys. We were prepared for the high price of food, but luckily had free continental each morning for the four of us (beverage, donuts, bagels, cereals, amazing fruit and yogurt). It was not very crowded to me. We never waited for an elevator and the beach was never too crowded. The pool area chairs filled up early, so we didn't always have access to seating, but we were in the water most of the time. The kid's club was a welcome treat for the boys and they spent two days there from 8:30am-3:00pm. Very well staffed, kid related and full of activities for them. It gave us time for golfing, shopping and the spa. The Mandara Spa is fantastic. I love to have massages and they do every aspect right. All five of the ladies who joined me were impressed. As long as you expect to spend money while in Hawaii, you will not be disappointed with the HHV. The closing perk was we reserved a hospitality check out room one day prior to our leaving, so on check out day we had valet store our luggage we beach it all day and at 4:00pm we checked into a standard room and they gave us until 5:20pm (20 minutes per guest in the room) to cleanup and get ready for our flight home. It made for a very pleasant ending. Don't waste your money on any of the airport shuttles. They were terrible. The taxi was cheaper for the 4 of us and much more time efficient. Aloha!

<Content>We were in awe of the Hilton Hawaiian Village We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village back in June for 2 weeks. We were on our honeymoon and after travelling for almost 24 and inevitably jet-lagged we were in awe of this fantastic hotel! I read other peoples comments on this site and cannot understand the complaints abour prices etc. This is the Hilton we're talking about here! I know it's expensive, but you somehow expect it! We too ate at the 'Wailana' coffee house across the road. 'Sergio's' Italian restaurant was wonderful, be sure to ask for Paul, we explained that we were on our honeymoon and we were presented with a Tiramisu dessert on the house with candles! We had a wonderful time and the staff were fantastic  courtious. We can't wait to go back and I certainly won't be staying at any other hotel but the Hilton!

<Content>Wish We Were Back! Our family of 4 spent 5 nights at the HHV in July, 2004 and absolutely loved it! It was our first stop in Hawaii and we didn't want to leave. We stayed in the Ali'i Tower, there was fresh fruit in the room on arrival, and the room was serviced at least twice a day with bottled water, chocolates and flowers left in the room in the evening. From our partial ocean front room we could see the ocean and the super pool and every night there is a half hour show with hula dancers and we could watch it poolside or right from the balcony. At night my daughter loved to sit on the balcony and listen to the music from the lounge off the lobby. Everyone was very friendly and helpful - Ali'i Tower was easy to check into, because it has it's own check-in versus the main lobby for the other towers. My son loved the penguins, parrots and fish, including the penguin feeding. There is an ABC store right at the resort for snacks, drinks, etc, and plenty of restaurants to choose from. Food is, of course, pricey, we ate at The Golden Dragon which is supposed to be one of the top Chinese Restaurants on Oahu, however, we found it to be just average Chinese food, and dinner for 4 was $160. Luckily there are plenty of places that are a short walk or drive from the resort - Our favorite was Brew Moon in the Ward Center.The only thing I would not recommend at the resort is seating for the Friday evening show. The show is good. It is located poolside. To sit by the pool there is a one drink minimum - no problem - except drinks are $10 and that's for kids too! OK - still no problem that's still cheap for a good show - but there were so many seats reserved for members of the frequent guest club, that the seats that were left for the rest of us, weren't too great. I ended up having to go stand somewhere in order to see. In addition, you waited about an hour on line for the seating to open. It's not that I'm not recommending the show - but save the $10 pp and just watch it just beyond the pool area or better yet from your balcony if it's facing the pool (our's was, and I wish we had done that).I was worried before we went that because of it's size it would feel very crowded, that was not the case, it had a fun, bustling resort feel, but definitely didn't feel over crowded. Valet parking was efficient and quick. Completely positive experience.Wish we were back!

<Content>A City Unto Itself My husband and I stayed at the HHV while he was attending a conference in late July. I, too, had read many reviews and comments before leaving for Hawaii. Thanks to those who had warned about the no free coffee in room, we brought our own favorite Green Mountain coffee and just used their sugar, which I am happy to report they didn't charge us for. As a public relations professional, I find it incredible that they continue to charge (and relatively quite a bit) for the coffee packets in the rooms. This one little detail has been written about here and on other sites -- and does much more damage to their reputation than if they would simply provide one or two packs in the rooms FREE of CHARGE. Sure, they could charge if you used more than your allotted one or two packs a day -- but it really is cheap of them and in the end, puts a damper on an otherwise splendid and pretty much well-deserved reputation. It is a huge place -- a city unto itself complete with post office. I prefer the quiet, out of the way places -- but at times, these mega resorts are also fun. The convention was fairly big, so it seemed the place was even more bustling than usual. When we first arrived, they had us down for a room with two double beds. Talked about a downer. Nothing like being in the realm of paradise with the one you love, and two double beds. After asking to see the manager, they put us into a full ocean view room in the Tapa Tower (33rd floor) and yes, it had a king bed. So all's well that ended well. We are Hilton Honors members and have been for awhile, which is why I think they honored our request with an upgrade (we were supposed to have a partial ocean view). All in all, you really have to work to be disappointed in paradise. And although crowded and pricey, the resort is in great shape and they take meticulous pride in the property. It was a great stay. Aloha!

<Content>Beautiful hotel but on site restaurants expensive We stayed at the Hawaiian Village for three nights July 12-15. We were in the Rainbow tower which is on of the best located, it is close to beach and pool. The hotel and grounds are beautiful, we were upgraded to an ocean view that was truly lovely. The only complaint that I can make is the cost of the food on the premises. (i.e 2 hot dogs 2 drinks  1 order of fries $25US. Across the street is a very good coffee shop with a $4.99 all you can eat pancake  egg breakfast. We noticed many guests of the HHV going to the coffee shop . We would definitely stay there again and just limit eating on the premises.

<Content>Paradise We stayed at the Hilton from July 22 to July 27. We were booked in the Rainbow Tower oceanfront room. The view from the 23rd floor was beautiful. You could see the ocean, Diamond Head, the pools and look all the way down the beach. Be sure to become a Hilton Honors member so you can use the express check in. The lines were very long durning peak arrival times. As for the resort everything was beautiful. It is well kept. It was an adventure just within the resort itself. You have beautiful greenery and not to mention all of the birds and fish. I do have to agree that they should not charge for the in room coffee and water. For what you pay for the room the least they could do is give you some coffee. All in all the stay was wonderful. We walked the beach and found out that we had the most beachfront and the best sand on Waikiki Beach. If you venture out of the resort, there are alot of restaurants to eat at that are not that expensive. Yes, I am ready to go back and I would stay at the Village again.

<Content>Convenient but bring your Visa card I just got back from a combined business/pleasure trip at the HHV. Ordinarily, I wouldn't be interested in a hotel you can spend your whole vacation at; however, my wife and I brought our infant son, and that definitely changes things! For families with young children, it's very nice to be able to access everything you need at the hotel-- multiple restaurants, a grocery store, pool, beach, etc. I agree with the previous reviewer, however (probably from the same conference) who felt nickled and dimed. Be prepared to pay top dollar for the coffee in your room, rentals for beach chairs and umbrellas, etc.-- or to go buy that stuff at the ABC store on site. I don't know whether that's a Waikiki thing or a HHV thing. In general, the staff were very friendly but some of the pool attendants were downright rude. I think that if you must stay in Waikiki, the HHV is about as good as it gets, but next time I'm going to go off the beaten path and try something a little quieter and more down to earth.

<Content>Loved the HHV! This was our third stay at the Village. We went for our 20th Anniversary. We belong to the Hilton Rewards Program. We had told them we were celebrating our 20th Anniversary. Upon checkin in we were upgraded from our reserved Rainbow Tower Room to an Oceanfront Room with two lanais! It was lovely and our best stay yet!

<Content>Alii Tower is a MUST! We stayed here during the APA conference from 7/28 - 8/2. It is like a mini Disneyland (without the rides) and yes there were A LOT of people. The hotel has around 4,000 rooms, so just beware that in the high season, there will be crowds. The Alii Tower is the only way to go (espcially if you are without kids). Our room was really nice, very comfortable and the private pool  fitness center provided a small sanctuary away from the masses. There are 22 restaurants in this Village, some are great, some could use new chefs: The Rainbow Lanai breakfast is pricey ($20 per person), but has one of the best omlette stations I have ever had. The Golden Dragon restaurant is great Chinese with such gracious service. Sergios's is an Italian restaurant that is okay, but much to expensive for too little flavor. No matter how good people say the Village Steak  Seafood is, don't get sucked in...we though we could have been eating leftovers.One more thing, if you do get enticed by the special invitation to tour the Vacation Club (AKA timeshare) make sure you have enough time left on your trip to spend the Hilton dollars you earn (we were given $200) and make the sales rep stick to the 90 minute time frame (ours when over by an hour). If you need a break from the sun and heat, it is a great way to get free money (or golf or spa treatment if you select that gift).

<Content>a mixed bag I went to the HHV for a conference, and read a lot of reviews before I went. The reviews prepared me steep prices and crowds -- but I still felt like I was nickle and dimed everytime I turned around. It is so crowded that you wait in line for everything -- a towel for the pool, to speak to a concierge, to buy a drink. Not the relaxing atmosphere I associate with Hawaii. I've never in my life stayed in a place that charged for a cup of coffee in the room or to use the fitness center or even to make a local call. Even the crummiest motel serves a free cup of coffee. The beach and pool are pretty and we met some nice families so our child had playmates, but the hotel itself was irritating. The staff were not particularly friendly or helpful. We had a mountain view room in Kalia Tower. There were mountains, but the traffic was so loud you couldn't open the door or sit on the balcony. This is my fourth trip to Hawaii, though the first to Honolulu. My advice is to skip the HHV all together and get a nice condo off the beaten path. It will be cheaper and you will have a much more satisfactory Hawaii experience.

<Content>Stayed here for business and thought it was great I stayed at HHV from July 6-10 while on business in Honolulu. I was traveling by myself on business and booked the HHV throught the Amex Platinum Card Fine Hotels and Resorts program. I booked a garden view room for $180 a night in the Alii Tower. Upon check in I was upgraded to a very nice oceanview king room on the 5th Floor which was very spacious with a sitting area with a couch and 2 chairs as well as a spacious lanai. The bathroom was very large and in addition the minibar there was a small bar size refrigerator where you could store you own drinks or food. The amex program afforded me not only the upgrade but also 2 lunches at the Rainbow Lanai, free breakfast daily as well as a 4pm check-out (that I didn't need).The resort is massive and a bit Disney but its very well run and if you have kids (I will be returning in November with my husband and 5 year old son) it is perfect. There is a large and relatively uncrowded beach in front of the Hilton with very warm and swimmable water. The Alii Tower has its own pool which was not crowded during the time I was there. They had a terrific free firework show over the beach on Friday night and I understand they do it every Friday. They also had a little hula show every night at the big pool ( which you can see from the oceanview bar deck of the Alii Tower). It's kind of corny but fun. Also the Alii Tower has free appetizers every night between 5pm and 7pm. Nothing fancy but they have cheese, crackers, veggies w/ dip, eggrolls, meatballs, etc.. Definitely a hearty snack if your inclined and for the little ones it can be a complete meal.Dining at the Village can be expensive or not depending on what you choose. Also, as you stroll towards diamond head on the beach path you will encounter several outdoor concessions that sell hot dogs, ice cream, shave ice for very good prices. You coud spend alot here but you don't have to. Also, there is an ABC store on the property which I thought was very reasonable. I bought a bottle of Kendall Jackson Chardonnay for $12.99 about the same as in a grocery store in CA.Overall this is not a romantic, secluded old hawaii experience but it is alot of fun and kids will love it.

<Content>Loved our view My husband and our two boys age 10  15 stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village from 7/18/04 to 7/24/04. We were in the Rainbow tower room 403. Our view of the ocean and Diamond Head were outstanding. We loved the the way that we could see the boys on the beach from our balcony. The room was very nice and had a small fridge, iron board, iron and hair dryer. The room seemed newer and was extremely clean and pretty. We did not have much sun on our balcony so if this is a plus to you then you should request this room. My sister and her family stayed in 402 across the hall and they had sun on their balcony all day long. Their room stayed very warm where as ours was nice and cool. They also has a view of the lagoon not the ocean. Hopefully you like to walk if you stay here because you do a lot of walking anywhere you go. The beach is nice but the price of renting the chairs and umbrella is unreasonable. $12.00 per each chair and $20.00 for the umbrella plus tax per day! I believe that the Hilton should provide these to their guests. Self parking is $12.00 a day and valet is $17.00 a day. The bar in the middle of the hotel (I believe it was called the Topia bar?) has wonderful Strawberry Daquiris. The best I have ever had! The mixed drinks run around $8.00 each. Not bad since they are large and have all the bells  whistles with them (little drink umbrella, slice of fruit etc..) I was disappointed that all but one swimming pool closed at 8pm. The one pool stayed open until 10pm. I believe that they should have their pools open longer for the kids to enjoy. Go to the ABC store which is on the grounds and pick up supplies when you get there. Bottles of coke are $1.00 compared to $2.50-$4.00 at the restaurants. A blow-up raft for the kids was $3.99 (much cheaper than renting one for $10.00 a day at the beach area) The staff was great. Very helpful and nice. On the beach you can buy snow cones reasonably priced and the kids loved them. The Tropics snack bar had a hamburger combo for $10.75, nachos for $7.75 and curly fries for $3.75. So bring lots of cash if you want to eat at the Hilton. If you go offsite, the Jack in the box (1 1/2 blocks away) has a good breakfast for $4.19 and there are McDonalds only 2 blocks away from the hotel. We went to Benihana's Jappanese Steak House (right on the Hilton site) one night for dinner and it was great. $18.50 for chicken and around $25-30 for the steak. I loved it but my one son and husband did not. Best service there. To get the real feel for Hawaii you must rent a car and go exploring. Leave the city congestion and take the street that runs around the island. We stopped at one scenic outlook and it was amazing. My sons walked out onto old lava by the ocean, I will never forget the view there. We also visited SANDY BEACH one day and my sons boogie boarded there. They had at least 10-20 foot waves hitting the shore. They had a great time. (dangerous if you can't swim or are not strong though) We went snorkeling at Hanauma Bay , beautiful and fun! Get there early. We got there at 7:30 AM and had no wait but by the time we left at around 12 noon there was about a 3 hour wait to get into the park. This was worth it. The water is clear, calm and the fish were plentiful. Rent the dry snorkel, it is worth the extra $3.00 they charge for it. We paid 1.00 to park, and 5.00 each to get into the park and 9.00 each to rent snorkel, mask and fins. Bring lots of suntan lotion and make sure someone puts lots on the back of your legs and shoulders. We were all red on the back of our legs from floating around in the water. Overall Hawaii was beautiful and the Hilton was a great place to stay. Bring lots of money and enjoy!!!!!

<Content>Hilton for Honeymooners!! We honeymooned in Hawaii from June 27th- July 3rd at the Hilton Hawaiian Village- Rainbow Tower- 19th floor. We were thrilled with our whole week at the Hilton! Everyone was very nice and accommodating to us. We had a deluxe oceanfront room with a king size bed. We hardly ever heard anyone in the hallway or in the next rooms. It was very quiet and just what we wanted for our honeymoon! The valet guys were nice and actually carried on a conversation with you while you waited. The wait was not that long. The grounds are clean and very well kept. The beach is clean and not crowded. We felt very safe here and cannot wait to go back in a couple of years. When we left (July 3rd), there was a bunch of people coming in for the holiday weekend, but we left just as they got there! I would highly recommend this place to stay. I am concerned about others who had a bad time here, because we were treated like royalty! There are a lot of things to choose from to do at this village or you can just relax the entire time that you are there! We did a little of both. We loved Benihana's Japanese Steakhouse and for our cheaper meals, we ate at Zippy's down the road ($12 for the two of us!). Try this place, I think that you will love it like we did!! We are looking at a return visit in the near future!

<Content>You Can't Win Em All After spending six glorious nights at the Sheraton in Maui, we spent the last night of our honeymoon here. We were happy to only spend the one night. The room was clean and the grounds are pretty, but the our ocean view was unimpressive since we could see only a sliver of ocean from our lanai. We stayed at the Hilton because the Royal Hawaiian was under construction. The Hilton is huge and rather impersonal; it is definitely less charming than the Royal Hawaiian and it was still very pricey. We love Hawaii and are returning to celebrate our anniversary in January, but we will not be returning to the Hilton.

<Content>Why Waikiki? I don't get it? The first question I have to ask is why? Why do you want to go to Waikiki? It's overbuilt. Too many buildings and not enough infrastructure to support it. The traffic is horrible. The smog is bad. I went there to party with some friends. I spent most of my days on the beaches in Kilua and the north shore. I would come back to Waikiki at night only. It's been 8 years since I have been to Oahu and it will be another 8 more before I go back. The beaches in Waikiki are dirty and the water is turbid. It only looks good from far away and in pictures. Well, about the hotel. If you are going to stay here, I would stay at the Hilton Hawaiin Village. The grounds are spread out and the scenery is very nice. The rooms are clean and well maintained. I had very good service. Some people write negative reviews about this complex, but I think you should avoid those reviews, because you may choose a smaller hotel that looks good in the pictures. You will be sorely dissappointed with hotels next to crowded, traffic filled roads and small dingy lobbies. The elevator will always be crowded and you will have to wait forever. Just to inform you, expect to pay for parking. This is a crowded city on an island. Parking is limited. At this hotel, parking cost $12 for self and $17 for valet. In San Francisco parking cost $28 for self and $33 for valet. So I am not bothered by the cost here. I felt it was cheap compared to other big cities. If you come here and you don't rent a car, you are cheating yourself. You should not spend all your time in Waikiki. There are so many beautiful little towns around the island that you won't see with tour buses or by staying in Waikiki. I think most people come here because they are afraid of being bored on the other islands. They should go to Maui. It has a mixture of partying and solitude. It's beautiful. The shopping on Oahu is nothing special. They have a lot of fancy shops mainly for the Japanese tourists. You won't find anything here that you can't buy at home. Well enough said. Enjoy your trip where ever you go. And remember, relax, you earned a vacation and you are paying for it. Don't spend all your time being upset.

<Content>HILTON HAWAIIAN - NEVER AGAIN DONT DO IT TO YOURSELF! I've paid $150 on Priceline for a week 7/12 to 7/19/2004. I was traveling with my wife and an infant son. When we got there, they had put us in room with double beds next to the service elevators. I've complained that I had reserved a room with a king sized bed on the hilton site. They promised me that they'll accomodate us as soon as a king room opened up. 3 days later they moved us to the next side of the elevator into a room with a king bed.They kept saying that they're completely booked. However, when I was at the Front Desk, I'd overheard the couple next to me with a Kama Aina Rate DISCOUNT was UPGRADED to the ALILI Tower. I'm a HH honors member with 10 nights this year and I didn't get ZIP. Rooms are old and musty. Best deal would be the Hawaii Prince and just walk to the beach. I've seen successful bids at $100 on Priceline.

<Content>Best location on Waikiki I stayed there for 7 days this summer, and I must say that my stay at HHV far exceeded my expectation. I was a little worried at uneven reviews at this site. I booked at their website with the Resort package, which includes free breakfast every day. Daily rate of $279 for a week was not necessarily cheap, but the location and the room that they put us into (top 31st floor of the Rainbow Tower with the whole view of Waikiki) more than compensated. I have kids (6 and 9), and I must assure that, for families, this would be the best place to stay in Waikiki. They have sizable beachfront. Some of the nice hotels do not even have nice beachfront. So many things are going on in the resort itself, with many shops and restaurants. I do not remember any incident that my needs were not immediately met. I would avoid a long weekend, though. As we were leaving at the start of Memorial day weekend, there were mob of people checking in. My kids still ask when we are going back to HHV, and, if we go back within a couple of years, I would definitely choose HHV again.

<Content>Not the way to experience Hawaii We visit Hawaii regularly and usually stay at more moderately priced hotels. This time we decided to splurge and stay at the village. We were extremely disappointed. The problem with this hotel is that it is a large complex of buildings that caters to conventions, etc... If you are there on a vacation, you don't feel like you are in Hawaii at all. This is the first time that we returned from Hawaii without that special Hawaii feeling.There are a number of other disadvantages to such a large facility. The attractive looking pool is all full (chairs reserved by other guest) by 9am. Getting your car takes forever, etc., etc. Also, because they cater to business travellers, the staff is not very friendly to tourists. For example, we could not go into the pool with our two year old because they did not allow her to use her floaters. We much prefer some of the smaller hotels on Waikiki and will definitely not be heading back to the HHV.

<Content>Great Trip We made our third trip to Hawaii this summer and stayed at the HHV. I have been reading posts on this website for some time now and decided to enter my opinion. First of all let me say that yes it is on the expensive side. But, I have stayed at many resorts and do not feel it is anymore expensive than other resorts. When you go first class expect to pay for first class. The staff was great. Stayed in the Tapa tower and the room was very nice. The many stores and shops on site are handy and nice attractions. Use the ABC store often. We went to several of the restaurants on site and found the food to be excellent. I will be staying here again on hopefully my fourth trip to the islands at some point.

<Content>Ali'i Tower was wonderful Excellent stay at the Ali'i Tower. Well furnished, quiet room in great shape. Nice fruit plate waiting in the room. Staff was very friendly. Lots of property and shops to explore, but the map we received at check-in was very helpful. Everywhere we ate was excellent. The flowers and plants on the property were wonderful to explore. The waves on the beach were very gentle.

<Content>Great time! Well, I went with the previous entry's author so I guess I can't add much to the novel she wrote. In a nutshell, I highly recommend staying at this hotel. Be sure to get at least a partial ocean view or you'll be stuck staring at people walking around within the complex for your view. The beach was packed on July 4th but it was empty the rest of the time. It was clean and the water had some gentle waves (you could definitely still float around in it). Ala Moana and the other end of the beach is an EASY walk...maps will give you a heart attack but the actual walk is pretty short. I'd definitely stay at this hotel again..the staff is very helpful and friendly!

<Content>Beautiful, contained, amazing staff, relaxing. The Hilton Hawaiian Village was like a self-contained cruise ship. Everything you wanted was within walking distance in the Village. With multiple pools and the beach, it was easy to find somewhere to go. The staff was helpful and kind, always addressing the guests by name. The onsite American Express staff not only booked all events, but had a solid knowledge on times to go, and best theater seats. All types of food and costs were available or you could hop a bus or trolley to go off site.The suite we stayed in was comfortable for four adults and quiet. I highly recommend the Hilton Hawaiian Village for a single, couple or family vacation. It was worth every penny!!

<Content>Wonderful Time at the Hilton Hawaiian Village 7/3/04 - 7/9/04 Stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village from 7/3/04-7/9/04 and it was great. Finding the main check in desk was a bit of an adventure since we were dropped off at the bus and tour depot instead of the main entrance (that is reserved for taxis and private vehicles). The girl at the check-in counter was very friendly and helpful and provided us with a map of the hotel grounds and directed us to our room. We were placed in a room on the 29th floor of the Tapa Tower with a partial ocean view. We didn't get an upgrade to an ocean view room like we had read about in other TripAdvisor reviews but that's ok. The room was really nice: it was spacious with 2 double beds and a mini-fridge with a kitchen sink. We had an amazing view from our lanai (balcony): we had a view of the beach, the ocean, Diamond Head, and the City. The room was nice and clean as was the bathroom. The only bad thing may have been that the walls were a bit on the thin side and we could hear the people in the room next door to us, we could hear when they flushed the toilet, when they closed the drawers in the bureau, and when they left their room we could hear their room door slam shut pretty loud. But, we didn't spend too much time in the room so it wasn't too bad especially since we had to wake up early most days to go on our island tours. The beach area by the hotel was really nice and not crowded at all as compared to the beachfront by the other hotels. We had taken a walk down Kalakalua Ave. where the bulk of the hotels were located and their beachfronts were JAM-PACKED. It made us grateful that we were staying at the Hilton, especially since we originally were thinking of staying at the Marriott. The walk from the Hilton to the Ala Moana Shopping Mall and the Waikiki Mall and stores wasn't all too bad. Maps make it look like there's a LONG walk but it was only a 15 minute walk in either direction to get to the shopping centers. We didn't ride The Bus or the trolleys. The food at the Hilton restaurants is on the pricey side and you have to dress up in order to eat at the bulk of them so we always ate away from the hotel except for the one time we ate at the Round Table Pizza located in the Rainbow Bazaar. If you are looking for good food, there is a coffee house located across the street from the Hilton: the Wailana Coffee House (good food at good prices ... the first day we went there, there was a LONG waiting line leading outside of the coffee house). You should also eat at (1) the Cheesecake Factory on Kalakaua Ave, (2) The Bubba Gump Shrimp Company at the Ala Moana Mall, (3) Assaggio's at the Ala Moana Mall, and Singha located across from the coffee house. But at Singha's ... don't order the pad thai (I did and it was the saltiest thing I have ever eaten. I complained to the waiter but he said that it was supposed to taste like that ... somehow I doubt that). The restaurants at the Ala Moana Mall were surprisingly REALLY REALLY good, we would definintely recommend eating there. The mall also houses a retaurant named after Jackie Chan but we didn't get a chance to eat there. As for Bubba Gump's Shrimp Company, earlier in the day we passed by one of the shopping malls on Kalakaua Ave. and I took a picture with some guy dressed up like a shrimp and we got a coupon for a free appetizer at the Shrimp Company ! It was big enough to feed 4 people ! The waiters were sooooo nice ! Not like you'd find in some NY restaurants. We did the Grand Circle Island Tour of O'ahu and it was okay but the tour guide only gave us about 5 minutes to take pictures at each stop. We went to Maui for a day and did the Haleakala crater tour and it was great. Much more time to take pictures and wonderful scenery. The flight was only 20 minutes from Oahu to Maui. On the Maui tour, our tour guide was 100% Hawaiian so we all learned how to speak a little Hawaiian and we learned how to properly pronounce the names of the islands and the streets.On Oahu, we also went snorkeling at Hanauma Bay. It was really fun but make sure that you get there as early as you can. It opens at 6 a.m. and by 8 a.m. the lines to get in are long and the bay gets quite crowded, but it's something you should do if you get a chance; do bring a beach towel, beach bag, food and water, and extra sunblock. If you don't bring your own food and water, you'll find that they charge an arm and a leg (for example: a bottle of water is $2.00, fries are $4.00 and a burger is $8.50). We had a late flight (10 p.m.) and we couldn't get a late check-out but that was okay because the hotel will give you a hospitality room. Basically the hospitality room is a regular hotel room that they let you use to freshen up before your flight; each person gets 20 minutes to shower and change into clean clothes so you'd better shower fast ! But it's great that they do that for guests because I don't know of any other hotel that would do that for you. All in all, we would definitely recommend staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It was such a beautiful and clean complex with friendly and helpful employees. It was honestly a pleasure.

<Content>Not Bad We spent four nights at the HHV at the end of June and one more night on the way back from Maui. The place is HUGE! Thousands of people roaming back and forth at all hours. It's a major destination for the Japanese - there were a number of large school groups staying there during our visit. Sheena Easton was performing at an outdoor concert for some group one evening.I was shocked to find that the in room safe was not free (a few $$ per day)!! No free in room coffee ($3.95 a pot, $2 a tea bag WOW). Also, every other moment you're being recruited to buy into their timeshare program.The location is a little isolated - not near the main Waikiki shopping strip.Overall the place is very large and rather impersonal.

<Content>not for the discriminating traveller Although the grounds are well kept and beautiful, it felt absolutely fake and manufactured. The rooms in the Tappa building were horribly outdated and need remodeling. The pillows are down filled, but the blanket and comforter were cheap motel quality. The 'garden view' on lower floors overlooked not a garden, but a parking garage. The upper floors were much better with a partial view of the ocean, but it took two days of harrassing to change the rooms. Beach was packed and $35 umbrella and chair rental is outrageous. The beach is neither pristine nor relaxing. Skip Waikiki and HHV and head to the smaller islands.On the plus, the hotel staff were very friendly and reponded to all requests and questions on timely manner (except for the room change). and the cocktails were only around $8 , which is better value then the $4 coke. Also, on Fridays they put a good Hawaiian show with fireworks, which anyone can go to.

<Content>Beautiful Resort We spent one night at the Hilton Hawaiian Village en route to Maui. I thought it was beautiful--well manicured grounds, lots of upscale shops, and a beautiful beach. A little hassle checking in, but once that was done, all was well. We stayed in the Kalia Tower, and although our view faced the other direction (city streets), the tower is very new and beautiful. My only complaints about the room are that the bathroom counter space was sparse (only a single sink), and there was no coffee pot or blow-dryer. If you are not already, join Hilton HHonors--that allows you to have a free continental breakfast each morning (quite a deal for Hawaii!!). The HHonors lounge in the Kalia Tower is on the 25th floor and has a breathtaking view. It seems there is always something going on at this hotel. Waverunner and boat rentals are available right on the beach. We were there on a Tues. night and saw a neat fire dancing show put on by the hotel. I imagine they do this every night, and it is free. This resort is fabulous. Aloha!

<Content>Noisy housekeeping in early hours of morning We booked a partial ocean view room for $205 and were allocated a room on the 16th floor of the Tapa tower. The 'partial' meant that we had to stick our head out of the balcony and look to our left to find the ocean, but it was a pretty view nonetheless. The room was spacious and clean with its own little bar corner and sink. On arrival were give a discount booklet with coupons for the stores in the Hilton - many where they had free things to redeem like a free bag, waterproof case in the shape of the dolphin, pin/pendant (we are trying to get our 200 bucks worth you see). It is easy just to stay inside the Hilton area and not even venture out to Waikiki, after all, it has its own restaurants, ABC store, and the beach as it's backyard. The numerous ponds with big goldfishies, penguins, flamingos and duckies kept my boyfriend fascinated and entertained! The lagoon however, didn鈥檛 seem to have much life in it apart from some small fish - we wondered what it was normally used for. We watched the King's Jubilee and then had dinner at the Rainbow Lanai and saw the fireworks from our table which was next to the giant opening overlooking the beach and next to the duck pond (if you are thinking of booking a luau elsewhere, don鈥檛 bother, just stay at the Hilton, watch the King's Jubilee show which has pretty good hula and other types of dancing, then have dinner at the Rainbow Lanai - Friday night is Hawaiian buffet. plus, you get the fireworks which were pretty good). The buffet dinner was yummo (they have a different theme each night), it cost $31pp but we used the Entertainment Card for 25% off (the info menus in the room have an old pricing on it). We only have one complaint about the Hilton - we could hear housekeeping very early in the morning - the trolleys, talking and banging of the doors - I definately woke up grumpy and spoilt my Hilton experience! We don鈥檛 suggest you stay in the HHV if you wish to explore the sights and sounds of Waikiki since it鈥檚 a decent walk away and you would be leaving a relatively expensive room empty most of the day, not to mention the fact that the grounds of the HHV is so pretty and full of things to do that you might not make it out to see the rest of the town.

<Content>Alii Tower Refreshingly Tranquil in Busy Resort Have been going to the islands for years and generally avoid Oahu and opt for other islands, and would prefer Royal or Halekelani if Waikiki bound, but was attending a conference at the Hilton. Initially dreaded it, but Hilton it was. Very careful about room selection (called Alii Tower front desk and talked to them about rooms after research indicated that Alii Tower was probably the best location) and quite pleased with the results and price. Alii Tower is quite nice. Closest to the beach and in the direction of the other hotels. It has the fewest stories, its own private pool and deck area with fitness center that was never crowded even when the main areas of the hotel were swarming with people, private check-in thereby avoiding main lobby, in-building concierge servce, friendly doorman, and several housekeeping visits per day. There is also a terrace cafe next to the pool with buffet breakfast (nominal charge was $14 for adults/ less for kids -- prefer Moana hotel's coffee biz near that' hotel's front door for a bagel/latte and then head outback to beachfront chair in Moana Courtyard when no one is there except the early a.m. surfers -- Aki at one of the beach huts in front of Dukes is a great instructor and it's a blast -- Duke's Breakfast Buffet, while not the greatest, is less... $10 ... than the nominal Hilton charge and included cooked to order eggs) but free pupus b/w 5-7:00 (nothing too special here but nice nonetheless.) From the terrace, there's a nice view of the ocean in both directions and, on the right, the main pool where sunset show/ torch lighting takes place. Our room was on second floor with a nice terrace overlooking the main pool -- Room A226. Plenty big, king bedded and also had a sofa bed. The second floor terraces are deeper than those above, landscaped and have two nice chairs with ottomans as oppposed to the floors above, which have the more typical highrise shallow balconies with tiny chairs and a table. No problem with noise, and I'm sensitive to that. Keycard door to private pool and terrace area, as well as private direct stairway down to the beach were just down the hall. You could avoid the elevators entirely if you wanted to, and in any event didn't have to go up and down and all around to get everywhere. The Room next door ... A227, I believe, is actually considered Ocean Front and has a huge terrace (at least 100 sq.ft.) overlooking the ocean and larger pool area, but then you'd be paying significantly more at which point I'd recommend staying somewhere else (see above). For $225 or below, A226 or the next garden view room over on the main pool side of that hall are very nice and a good deal. You get the added beauty and privacy of all of the foliage from the ground floor plants (palm trees swaying, etc.), so we just left the curtains open most of the time, which you really wouldn't want to do in most rooms. There are some rooms on the same floor (2nd) that are actually accessed via the the private pool terrace, but they are down a few stairs from the pool deck and too low to have much view, hence the garden view designation. But then you would be looking out on lounge chairs and concrete, and they would not be as private either; we'd initially considered those as well but am glad that we went the other way. I'd definitely go back, especially with teens and twenty something year-old kids, but I'd want the same room or the OF A227 if I could get it for a good price. Went to Hanalei, Kauai for the following week and rented a cottage with tons of charm, a mosquito net over the bed and a grill for cooking fish over kiave wood, all of which all reminds me of Waikiki when I was a child. Now that's my paradise -- Aloha! If you're adventurous, visit Chinatown for some Chinese or Vietnamese Food for lunch, the later was great and very inexpensive, and then buy flowers and a lei needle/string ... $4 for a produce size plastic bag of plumeria and the trimmings ... from any one of the lei vending shops, which are all located rights there, and make your own while sitting at the Hilton's Alii Terrace having Mai Tais and pupus.

<Content>Don't stay here on your honeymoon!!! I don't know what these people are talking about who enjoyed this place for their honeymoon. It's not romantic at all. If you consider screaming kids and elevators full of conventioners romantic, then I guess this is the place for you. Yes, the grounds are well kept, but it all feels really fake. It has a manufactured atmosphere sort of like a Vegas hotel or something in Disney World. It's probably great if you have kids, but if you are planning a romantic getaway, you can't go wrong with the Halekulani. It's worth it if you can afford it. It's location is cental Waikiki and it has the best ambience for couples.

<Content>Don't Judge a Book By Its Cover Looks can be deceiving, such was the case with our recent stay at the HHV. We were assigned an upgraded room in the Kalia Tower at the furthest point from the beach, pools and other activities, but nearest point to the downtown streets. Just the reason for traveling to Hawaii. Directions out of the parking lot were unclear and eventually led us to a ballroom with our luggage, but no clear way to the elevators or to our room. We were finally led through back service passages to the hotel's elevators. We were not told that the Kalia Tower was actually the location for timeshare guests. During our stay, we did not receive any housekeeping service - not by choice. Rooms were small. A limited view of the ocean was available, just try to block out all the rooftops and focus your binoculars. Parking rates varied from $12/day self-park to $15/day valet, but we were charged $17/day on the bill. A far better option is to enjoy the Hilton Waikoloa Resort on the Big Island of Hawai'i

<Content>Exceeded our expectations! We honeymooned in Hawaii for two weeks the first being at the Hilton Hawaiin Village Resort. What a place. We stayed in the Kalia Tower which is not one better towers but we were thrilled with everything it had to offer! First thing we noticed were the meticulously landscaped lawns and gardens. Check-in was quick and very easy. The rooms were gorgeous. Everything you would expect from a Hilton and MORE! We had done significant research on hotels in Oahu and I can say after seeing all the other locations we considered such as Sheraton Moana Surfrider, Marriot Waikiki and many others we were thrilled with our decision to stay at HHV. Plenty of pool area (each tower has one and a Super pool in teh middle), teh property sits ON the beach! A beautiful lagoon to take walks along. There were 21 restaurant and 22 stores right on site. You'd never have to leave if you so chose. Fine dining Restaurants like Benihanna, Golden Dragon (chinese), Sergios (Italian), as well as Regular eating places like pizzerias, delis, hot dog stands. Shopping was a bit pricey compared to shops a half mile away but boy was the stuff nice!! I would recommend the HHV only because I don't know how you could have a bad experience here. Think Hilton quality and you will be pleasantly surprised!! A couple of other places that were comparable but a little pricier. THe JW Marriot Gofl Resort in Ko'Olina. This place is away from the hustle and bustle of Honolulu. When we go back we will probably stay there to get some variety. We played the Ko'Olina golf course and it is well worth it!!! We also had the pleasure of going to a hotel called Ala Moana Hotel. Not on a beach but very elegant lobby. No comment on the rooms as we did not see them. If you go to Oahu whereever you stay you HAVE to eat at Aaron's in the Ala Moana hotel. The food is great but the service is incredible!

<Content>Honeymoon at HH Village Hotel was out of this world, AWESOME!! I had stayed there before, but went back on my honeymoon and it was five hundred times better! Shopping was plentiful and the grounds were breathtaking. Great beach, great service in the restraunts. Very nice staff. We were upgraded from the cheapest room in the entire resort, to the Alii towers! The room was amazing! TV in the toilet room!!!! Very spacious!!!! We walked down to market areas and to the mall in the other direction. Very convenient location. Highly reccomend and will definitely return in a heartbeat! STAY HERE, YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!!!!!

<Content>PARADISE AT THE HILTON HAWAIIAN VILLAGE My husband and I honeymooned at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in 1984, and have been back five times since then. Our latest trip was last year - 2003. We love it there. We always stay at the Rainbow Tower, Delux Ocean View, is it pricey, absolutely, but you pay for paradise. The grounds are beautiful, the staff does a wonderful job in keeping it clean. The Hilton is in a great location, off the beaten path, but you still have your privacy. It is a town within a hotel, it has everything you need. Drinks are pricey, food is pricey, but you don't have to eat there, that is your choice, you have to expect expensive. If you are looking for a bargain, this is not the place to stay. We love having breakfast at the Rainbow Tower buffet early in the morning, looking right out on to the beach, what a great way to start your day. The only thing I find unfair, while I realize the hotel does not own it, is the beach chair and umbrella stand, I do feel for the price you pay to stay at the hotel, the hotel should find a way to give their guests these items complimentry. We would rather save for a trip to the Hilton Hawaiian Village for two years then go anywhere else, it is well worth it, and YES, it is truly paradise!

<Content>Thanks for the Great Vacation Memories HHV! It was PARADISE! Our family stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village from 5/29/04 - 6/8/04 and it was the best vacation ever. We first stayed at the Hotel (Diamond Head Tower - 17th floor) for 7 nights before moving on to our timeshare portion for an extra three nights. Upon check-in, I had asked for an ocean view if possible. Well, it got better, we received an upgrade to a one-bedroom suite on the top floor of the Diamond Head Tower. We had a wonderful ocean view with a partial view of Diamond Head which was great. It was so wonderful waking up in the morning and walking out to our belcony and seeing our gorgeous view Waikiki beach. The timeshare (Lagoon Tower) was great as well. Hilton Hawaiian Village is definitely the place to stay. My husband and especially our two boys had a wonderful time. The staff was very helpful and always had a smile. It is true that when you stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, you really don't have to leave. Everything is there at the Village. It is also very true that it can be pretty pricey, but it is well worth it. If our boys had their way, we would stay at the beach and pool everyday during our entire stay. We most definitely will return and stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Thank you for making our vacation a great one!

<Content>Good Time We stayed in the Rainbow tower with a view of Waikiki - which was really lovely. As it is at the end of the beach, I found the beach directly in front of the hotel cleaner, less crowded and not occupied by homeless and the passed out drunks I noticed while walking the length of the beach, which was nice.The only negative observation would have to be, as everyone else has mentioned, the nickle and diming over the small stuff i.e. coffee, water, parking. I mean, you can get complimentary coffee at a Super 8 in Moab Utah, it shouldn't be a big deal and would be a happy perk. The ABC store on the property was a big help for the little stuff.Food on the property good, but pricey.

<Content>Best Hotel In Oahu The Hilton Hawaiian Village was the best place to stay in Hawaii when I went with my mother and sister on May 27 for a week. The room was very nice the people were always kind, and the beach was really breathtaking. I loved the ABC store in the hotel and the best place we ate was the Round Table Pizza. The hotel was beautiful all over and the animals were adorable. It was expensive at times but uh its so worth it because I was in paradise. I would come back again and stay longer at the Hilton Hawaiian Village.

<Content>Great View from the Rainbow tower !!!! We had an Ocean front view roon on the tenth floor of the Rainbow tower. At check in we were told that we were upgraded to a better view room because my wife is a Hilton Honors member. Our view from our balcony was facing Diamond head and Wikiki beach !!!!The room itself was average to above average, the bathroom was a bit small but clean. Nothing came with the room not even free coffee,everything was an extra charge. We brought our own coffee because we had done our research on tripadvisor.com ! We had gotten a rental car so we could eat off property every meal and we bought a few things from the ABC store which was near by.Since we had a rental car we had to pay $12.50 per day to park in their parking garage, Still we came out better off because taxi's were very expensive. We drove to Pearl Harbor and along the east coast so the rental car was worth every penny.Friday night they had a Hula show and fireworks which was really neat but it was $8.00 to get a seat for it. Although The $8.00 dollars gets ya one drink I thought I'd mention.The pictures I took from our balcony and on the HHV property came out great.Yes HHV is very expensive but the memories are priceless.

<Content>Wonderfully Hilton Just returned from a wonderful Hawaiian vacation that included Maui, Kauai and Oahu. While in Oahu, we stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It is very nice. It is true, you really don't have to leave this place, unless you just want to. As far as location goes, I appreciate the fact that it is on the end of Waikiki and not part of all of the goings ons. We stayed in the Kalia Tower. Brand new rooms, a little on the small side. Very clean and I have always appreciated Hilton's eye for detail. Not the place to go if you want intimacy and romance, however. I find that this Hilton, like all Hiltons, caters to the business and leisure crowd in that functional Hilton way. You either like it or you don't.

<Content>Nice LOcation We just arrived back from a 4 island stay in Hawaii. The Hilton Hawaiian viillage was our first stop. The first thing we noticed is how the staff at this hotel seemed so unhappy. We were never greeted by staff as we meet them on the property and they all had frowns on their faces. We were dropped off on the tour bus circle which is a hike to the front lobby on the other side of the hotel. Once we finally got our room in the in the Tapa Tower we were happy with it. It was large with a ocean view. The best thing about the hotel is that every bus and tour makes a stop at the hotel so you will not have to have a car during your stay. Even the malls and stores have free pick up!!!!Our total assessment of the hotel is great place and grounds but don't expect Hawaiian Hospitality because it is not here! The HHV was on the most commercial and our least favorite island.

<Content>wow...breathtaking Paradise...yup that pretty much sums it up, Every turn you take you are completely amazed. My husband and I were there on our honeymoon-first time to Hawaii and his first time anywhere tropical! As you're walking along you are greeted by friendly people all over the islands for that matter, there are flamingos parrots beautiful paths connecting to each tower lined with ponds filled with beautiful tropical fish, the beach is footsteps away and paradise is at your doorstep-only downfall the food is extremely expensive and so are the drinks- like 18 bucks for two cocktails thats not including the tip but not to fear-the hilton is in the heart of Honolulu and moments away from great restaurants where you can eat for a considerable less amount of money but I do have to admit, the best seafood we ate was the first night 54 bucks for a steak and lobster tail and everybit worth it. Anyway I highly suggest it- I've been away quite often and the hilton is by far the most spectacular place Ive ever stayed hilton Hawaiian village I think not...Hilton Hawaiian Paradise..........DEFINITELY! enjoy -have a lava flow for me!

<Content>I WANNA GO BACK!!! Incredible! We were lucky and got an upgrade on our reservations. The Rainbow Tower, 31st floor with full-ocean view, is definitely the place to be.Diamond Head and ocean view was fabulous. Valet parking was the best. After a long day when we returned tired and worn out the valet asked me how was our day and I said great but I'm tired. Hesaid Well, you are home now. Everyone was nice and helpful. Yes, it was pricey but you get what you pay for. We will return one day and stay at the Hilton Hawaiian again.

<Content>This hotel has a great view! Overall a great place to stay. Thils hotel was a fabulous deal for me. I got my room for $114 a night on hotwire.com and then when I got here, I upgraded to the Rainbow tower for an oceanview room for an additional $60 per night. Totally worth the upgrade. The view is just like that of those on postcards of Waikiki Beach. As far as furnishings-it's your typical Hilton/Mariott type, but very clean and nice. I had a mini bar with a wet sink and fridge, a nice extra perk for the room. The resort is huge, but offers many activities that are free, such as Lei making. This place has one of the best areas of beach on Waikiki. You are in Hawaii and end up paying for alot. Count on the cost of food being 25% higher than on the mainland. The cost for a burger and fries in the hotel restaurant is $14.50. It's not the hotel overcharging, it's just more expensive period here in Hawaii. As long as you come prepared with the mindset that Hawaii is not a Bargains Galore place, you'll be fine. I wen't to the local grocery store and got some Diet Coke, Bagels, Cream Cheese and Snacks to help combat a bit of the cost issues. I'd rather spend $2.99 on a bagel than $40 for breakfast for two people, but that is just me. I was quite impressed with the staff here. Very friendly. I saw, nor encountered, any discrimination. There are bands that play at night, so if you plan on going to bed at 8 pm, don't get a room on the lower floors in the Rainbow Tower. The outdoor lounge is right there.They are done by 9 pm. As far as the mold issue mentioned in a previous review- There WAS a major mold problem in the new tower built, but they shut it down months ago and spent millions of dollars fixing the problem. It's been reopened for a while now, with a clean bill of health. It was a big deal, as it was in all the papers. All in all- I really liked this place. Lots of tropical birds, and great animals, which ad a nice touch. Lots of shopping and restaurants. This is a very nice resort to stay at. The best views are in the Rainbow Tower. Also DSL is available in the Rainbow Tower. I would stay here again.

<Content>Seeing is believing!!!!! I just returned from an 8 day vacation. I went over alone to relax and it was great. I was in the Kalia Tower with the mountain view and what a beautiful view it was. I arrived and my luggage was taken to my room by the bell service. I checked in and the front desk was polite, full of smiles and ready to meet any needs that I had. The resort alone is breath-taking with so much to see and so many shops to visit. Their are more than enough places to eat at on the resort as well as just a couple of steps away. I didn't have a car but taxi's are available(very expensive) or take the bus that runs directly in front of the resort for a $2 one way and they give you a transit ticket to ride back free. The mandara spa was wonderful, but very expensive ranging from $98 for a facial to $140 for a 50 minute massage. I made reservations Bali by the Sea, and Golden Dragon 48hrs before I arrived and was booked. For 1 person including an appetizer and meal expect to pay nothing less that $75-80. The food was good if you have the money and want to dine like the rich. To rent an inroom movie is $9.99-12.99 depending on the movie. Internet use is $9.99 and Sony Playstaion also. The decor to my room on the 19th floor was beautiful, with everything I wanted and more. You have a safe inroom, a small frig, a love seat, table, dest with 2 chairs, king size bed, large fresh towels, 28-32inch tv, nice size bathroom. The resort grounds are manicured while eveyone is sleeping, security is around the clock, to rent a beach chair and umbrella is $30 for the day. Pop is $3.75 for 16 oz, burgers and fries at the Topic lounge is $12.00. The Ala Mona mall is walking distance (10-15minutes) and 4 levels and over 200. Restuarants on the 4th floor, I ate at Jackie Chan and the price was reasonable and tasted good. I took 2 tours(Pearl Harbor  Battleship Missouri was $45 and a Majestic Island Tour of the entire island at $63. Both tours were great. Visit the International Market, you can find some bargins if you know how to deal and stand your ground, I also ate at the Cheesecake Factory for lunch, reasonable price and the cheesecake list is long, so much to chose from. The Royal Hawaiian mall across from the Market is nice, The ward shopping center is nice also. Overall I had a great time just relaxing, seeing the sights, shopping, and eating at different places. The resort is everything I was looking for and more. Be ready to spend some big bucks also, it is not a poor mans resort.

<Content>Discriminates Stayed in the Rainbow Tower....outdoor music so loud no one could sleep. Reservation clerks very rude. Mold prevalent in one of the towers, but believe it's been closed down....Standard three star hotel at higher rates. Try Iliaki Hotel first..still in Waikiai but better price. Premium prices for food and activities. $10.00 for parking and a long walk.

<Content>what a place we just love it. After staying at the one on the Big Island. It really sold us to stay in the one in OAHU. We were so impressed that we purchased a time share. THe accomdations and the decor of this place is overwhelming. It is a GEM OF A PLACE TO STAY. To be able to watch the waves every morning on a balcony along with the nightly Friday firworks!

<Content>Wouldn't stay anywhere else! My husband and I stayed at HHV April 25-29, 2004 after doing a 7-day cruise around the islands. When I made the reservations I explained about the cruise and they said I could get an early check-in. We left the ship about 8:45 am and we were literally in our Rainbow Tower room (1213) at 9:30 am! It was exactly what I wanted -- an expansive ocean view with Diamond Head in the background. It was a large room with a king-sized bed -- very comfortable.The hotel and grounds were very beautiful and lushly green. I was even impressed that the beach was raked every morning! It was wonderful being able to leave the balcony door open during the night and not have the air conditioning going. It was great going to sleep with the waves pounding against the shore.The restaurants were very expensive, but it is Hawaii. We have saved almost 2 years for this vacation, and we weren't going to let this stand in our way. We found a small coffee shop just across the street from HHV for breakfast -- it really did a land office business for breakfast! We did eat at the Golden Dragon our last night -- very good food -- since we had an Entertainment coupon. It was about the price for a very nice meal that we would pay for at home (Chicago suburb).I chose the HHV mainly for the convenience -- car rental desk, trolley stops, on beach front. For some reason I vaguely remember always wanting to stay at the HHV when I first heard about it. And I finally did! And for the final praise -- I asked for a late checkout since our shuttle pickup for the hotel wasn't until 4 pm. And there wasn't a problem!All in all I would definitely stay at the HHV again if I ever make it to Oahu again. All of the staff, including wait staff, were very courteous and pleasant.

<Content>Wonderful View My friend and I had to get out of the house so my partner could study. Where better to go than HI!I had always wanted to stay at the HHV and was thankful that my travelling companion did not object to the $325.00 (+ about $40.00tax) per night room rate.We stayed in the Ali'i Tower (Rm 1306) and were stunned by the wonderful view. Usually and Ocean View room w/2 beds is not as well located as one w/only 1 bed, but we were fortunate.We could see the sun rise, Diamond Head, Waikiki Beach and wonderful star constellations at night. The decor is kind of a 70's throwback, some of the drawers stuck as did the pocket door to the bathroom area.Having stayed at luxury hotels before I was expecting more from Ali'l Tower privileges. I assume that since they are offering Executive floor services to an entire Tower, one can't expect three presentations a day w/complimentary continental breakfast and evening cocktails. I was also disappointed that there is no call down service for the valet. This would be a welcome perk, especially for Ali'i Tower guests.Check in was smooth and the staff was courteous. One Concierge was taken aback when asked for directions to Honolulu's gay nightlife. His demeanor was surprising given the varied clientele that comes through the doors.Overall, the view from the room disapated most ill will for the minor flaws we found. You do pay for everything and everything is expensive, but this is Waikiki in Spring! What are you expecting?I would stay again, but only in a comparable room in the Ali'i Tower. Anything less could be found for a better price elsewhere on the Strip.

<Content>When Only The Best Will Do! We stayed at the Ali Garden Tower. 4/14 - 4/21/04. The first room that was given, I did not like the view. I had ordered the garden view, but it faced another of the Hotel's towers and the garden was too far away. I upgraded for $20 to a partial ocean view and it was GREAT. (Room 1520). Quite a lot of the ocean was visible and the city lights at night were breathtaking. The hotel is beautifully appointed, with many birds, fish, even penguins. Winding paths take you to many enjoyable areas with lush landscaping, delightful ponds and scenery. The village has many unique shops to browse. The food at the many restaurants is fair to good, but expensive. For example a medium size coke is $3.75! Cheeseburger, small salad  coke, was $18.75. Just outside of the grounds there are lots of restaurants with regular prices, however. Our room was very nice, with a large bath. Service was excellent overall. The hotel offers lots of things to do, including Hawaiian dancers at the pool and fireworks. Everything you really need is there, and I highly recommend this complex.

<Content>Worth the research.. Although we have visited Hawaii several times we had never stayed on Oahu. We planned a 3 night stay at the end of our visit to Kauai so that we could see Pearl Harbor, North Shore, Waikiki and other well known spots mid-April 2004. Since we are used to the less populated islands I was concerned about the high-rise 'big city atmosphere I expected to find on Oahu. I spent several evenings looking for the right hotel at the right price. I finally selected Hilton Hawaiian Village - ocean front room in the Rainbow Tower. I used the resort maps on Hilton web site to get orientation of towers. It was definitely the right hotel - but price was more than I had hoped to spend. We were on a upper floor and had wonderful views of Diamond Head and the ocean, the beach and sunset. As others have mentioned the hotel is expensive and you pay for everything - even the coffee in the room. We found the the shopping and restaurants on the grounds to be convenient. We accomplished our goal of seeing Pearl Harbor, the North Shore (but the surf was flat) and the Waikiki area. I can't say that I'll visit Oahu again - we like less crowded areas but I would recommend this hotel if you select your room carefully. We had a lovely dinner at Keo's in Waikiki - the flowers in that restaurant are gorgeous!

<Content>Expensive, nice grounds, get ready to walk I just got back from HHV today 4/22/04 and thought I'd let people in on what my mother and I thought of the place. First the grounds are beautiful and there are birds and fish ponds everywhere. This is really nice. The room which we stayed in Ali'i Tower was ok. It was clean but nothing out of the ordinary for the price you pay. If you don't want a rental car this is the place to stay because there is good shopping and great restaurants on site. The Hilo Hattie free bus will take you there and drop you off down the street at a huge shopping center. There's also a restaurant that is very inexpensive next door to hilo hattie called Zippy's. Food is great, it's cheap, quick, offers huge variety and you don't even need a taxi just use the hilo hattie trolley and walk across the street. Anyway over all the HHV is a safe bet, expensive but clean rooms and nice grounds. You will have to walk a mile it seems to get anywhere because the place is so big. I would recommend this hotel to others if you've got the money and don't mind so so rooms. Also do splurge and eat at Bali by the sea....it's expensive but well worth it. Make reservations, dress nice and enjoy particularly the filet mignion which costes about $35 and try the bali salad with champaigne sauce. One of the best meals I've ever eaten and the service is surperb. Hope this helps narrow the decision in finding a place to stay.

<Content>Great time at HHV We spent spring break at the HHV and loved every minute of our time there. We were upgraded to a partial oceanview which was a nice surprise. The staff was great, the room was clean, and the location wonderful. The shops and grounds were entertaining. The restaurants WERE expensive but it's an easy walk to many others off the grounds. I would recommend the hotel and hope to return soon.

<Content>Superb resort Myself, my wife and our two young daughters stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village from 5th April to 14th April. The hotel is superbly situated right on the best part of Waikiki beach. There are numerous bars, restaurants  shops on site, all of excellent quality. All of the staff were very polite, friendly  helpful. We stayed in the Kalia Tower, our room was excellent, very clean  modern. Some people seem to complain about the prices charged at this hotel, but it is no more expensive that any other top quality beach front resort. The hotel complex is beautifully laid out, full of exoitic plants  wildlife. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Waikiki. This was our third visit to Hawaii, and we would not now consider staying anywhere else in the future.

<Content>Beautiful, Fun Resort My husband, myself and our 16 year old daughter stayed at the HHV over Easter. First off, when you arrive at this resort it is overwhelmingly gorgeous. Breathtaking for sure. We stayed 8 Nights and had an absolute blast. We mentally prepared ourselves to put out a lot of money at this Hilton Resort. We acknowledged prior to going that we cannot generally afford to dine at our local Hilton, much less one in Hawaii. So we psyched ourselves up and prepared for it. We bought a Lonely Planet Waikiki/Oahu guide and found many economical ways to eat and have fun. The Easter Buffet was no more expensive than regular buffets here at home or in Vegas or anywhere else we've been. We stocked up on snacks at Safeway instead of the ABC store which saved us major money and we weren't at all offended at the cost of the drinks. They weren't much different in price compared to our own local bars. We had reserved a standard room with one request, not to be out towards the road. When we arrived, we were upgraded for free, without asking for it. We had a partial ocean view. Not enough of a view I'd want to pay for but for a free upgrade it was great. Our room was large enough for us, the only complaint was no ventilation in the bathroom, which obviously helps contribute to the slight musty odors in some of the rooms, along with wet towels and beach clothes. Overall, we loved the place and had a wonderful time. We were rather disappointed at having to pay rental $$ for beach loungers but hey...we dealt with it. The beach was the prettiest and largest and least crowded than the others. The staff was friendly and very accomodating. We toured a few of the nearby famous resorts and found none to be any better than the HHV. Most had smaller beaches, and an older feel to them. We have already booked another trip to the HHV for next Dec. Would recommend this place to anyone who is not looking for absolute top of the line accomodations. As my husband told our inquiring friends..The HHV is a high end resort for regular people

<Content>Hilton Hawaiin Vacation Just returned from a nine night stay at the Lagoon Tower of the HHV. Overall it was fantastic. The village is the place to stay loads of shops and restaurants. The super pool is located steps from the beach which was great for our teenagers. Everyone was very helpful just ask... Yes it is extremly expensive for anything extra I travel all over for both business and pleasure and this is the first hotel that charges so much extra for the fitness center $12 is excessive to work out. Great entertainment nightly in the lobby bar. The ABC store enables you to buy those extra snacks and drinks for the kids at a decent price. I did not see Paris walking around where was she?

<Content>Beautiful Resort We spent 3 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki in their luxury tower, and we had so much fun. The hotel and beach area are kept very nice. You have access to shops, car rentals, and restaurants. There is also a beautiful stretch of beach 10 steps away from the hotel. I would recommend staying there and I think it is the best place to stay on Waikiki Beach. All of the other hotels were either not on the beach, or something scary out of the 70s.

<Content>Ali'l Tower Overated, very average. Village complex itself is very nice, expansive with interesting views (flamingos, penguins). However, the amenities and restaurant prices are outrageous. My kids wanted a pizza ($11 for a small child portion) and a hotdog ($7). This was at the Tropics outdoor casual dining facility on the beach. This being our third trip to the islands we were looking forward to our stay in the much talked about Ali'i tower. The room was very average, in fact we have stayed in more luxurious surroundings for less money at the historic Ala Moana . The room was a partial ocean view, meaning you had to stretch your neck out to see the beach from the terrace. There was a faint musty odor in the room, staining on the wall, and a bathroom without an exhaust fan. The promised three times daily maid service, was actually twice a day. Which was okay since we are not particularly messy folks. The advertised fresh fruit amenity only occurred once on arrival. We did however, receive two bottles of water twice a day and in room coffee at no charge. There is a complimentary excercise room on the second floor terrace next to the private pool for Ali 'l guests which was nice. The pool is small and often crowded as the rest of the hotel pools. There is free appetizers daily at 5 pm which often subsituted for dinner. However, my advice is to avoid ordering drinks unless you don't mind $6 cokes and $7 smoothie drinks for the kids. I guess we were spoiled by our previous experience with the Hyatt executive program where there is free breakfast and appetizers in the afternoon (yes, that also includes free cocktails!). Aside, from that our stay was pleasant. Granted one has to expect a certain amount of spending when on vacation, it just seems that we've stayed elsewhere that provided much more for the value of our money. One final tip, go out of the village for a meal that won't leave you in sticker shock. The Hilton's village Steak and Seafood was offering an Easter brunch that sounded delightful however it would cost $120 for our family of four. Instead, we walked to Todai's Japanese buffet which was phenomenal with all kinds of fresh seafood and pan asian dishes for $48 for all of us ( just across from HHV). The highlight of my daughter's stay at HHV? Seeing Paris Hilton walk through the pool area.

<Content>good, but poor ocean view from Kalia Tower nice place, we enjoyed it, I'd give it a positive review.On the negative side, if I ever come back I will not stay at the Kalia Tower. Although the room was nice, our 'ocean view' that I supposedly paid extra for was rather poor because the tower is about 4 football fields away from the beach, with two other towers partially obstructing the view. Because of the large distance between us and the beach we also got the privilege of looking at the air conditioning ducts on the roof of the building in front of us (about 2 football fields long). So, we had a view of the ocean, but not a 'pretty' view.

<Content>Absolutely Loved It My wife and I stayed at this property for 10 days, and it is absolutely gorgeous. Check-in/Check-out was a snap and every staff member that we encountered was helpful and very friendly. The on-site amenities are endless. Also, you must visit the Mandara Spa - well worth the money. We had a massage that relaxed us from head to toe. The HHV has a staff on-hand to help you book all of your adventures. They helped us book everything from parasailing to a catamarran ride and the service was free. We have many pictures of the grounds and everyone who has seen them simply marvels at their beauty. I can't wait to return, and I will be staying the HHV.

<Content>great view, nice little post office onsite, we loved it We stayed in the Rainbow Tower and were amazed at the view. This is the first Hawaiin hotel I've stayed at where oceanview really meant oceanview. No coy little hidden meanings to the word, no oceanview - what you can see of it between those two hotels next door'. No this was a sweeping postcard of a view of Waikiki Beach and Diamondhead and the ocean. And I used the post office in the Tapa Tower daily to mail souvenirs home to relatives and friends. There is a wonderful assortment of shops on the grounds, and you're within blocks of other malls and hotels. Best of all, the shuttle boat out to the Atlantis Submarine leaves from a dock at the beach right outside. One word of warning though, about some of the people you'll find selling their wares on the beach nearby. Look out for a man with parrots perched on his bicycle. he'll be in the shade of a tree near the beach. If you give him money to photograph you holding his parrots, you will never see the photos- he is strictly a con man, in no way associated with the hotel, no matter what he tells you.

<Content>Overall great resort! Staff was friendly, attentive, and very organized. The resort had beautiful landscaping and wildlife. The rooms in the Tapa tower were average --- don't expect much of an oceanview (we were on the 17th floor  if you lean over the rail you could see a little water). The pool area was too crowded, not enough chairs! The other downside was the cost of the food/beverage on property. I've been to many islands and yes, things tend to be a bit more than they are on the mainland---but these prices were extremely too expensive. If you go off of the property you can get a large breakfast for $4.99 (Coffee House across the street) versus $19.50 on property. A couple of insider hints---reserve the hospitality room to freshen up before you leave on your late flight (you get to use a hotel room for 20 minutes per person after check out)  use the airport shuttle from the hotel ($9 per person and goes direct to airport). Overall, very nice resort if you are prepared for the costs  general crowding experienced in Waikiki. Please tour the rest of the island---Honolulu is a very large city  you won't enjoy the true beauty of Hawaii.

<Content>There's no place like HHV! Just returned from our third visit to Hawaii and the Hilton Hawaiian Village (March 7-13). I cannot imagine staying anywhere other than HHV. It is like visiting an old and cherished friend. Our last two visits have been spent in the Ali Tower and the staff there is wonderful. You can quickly become spoiled to the twice a day maid service and the nightly turn-down service. You would have a wonderful vacation if you never left the Village. Everything you can possibly need or want is there. I even look forward to the almost daily trips to the ABC store! Just steps away from the beach, HHV is truly a part of paradise!

<Content>Best hotel in Honolulu The Hilton Hawaiian Village was wonderful. This time we stayed in the Kalia tower and enjoyed every minute. This is a huge hotel, but in the heart of everything and not as busy as the hotels on Waikkiki Beach. Food very good, spa very nice, room was beautiful. Bus stop steps away to shopping and tourist spots. Friday night fireworks show at the hotel was incredible. Beach very nice...Hotel property very open though, so if it's raining you will get wet. Ate at Benihana on the property and did not enjoy the food even though the cook was entertaining. Pizza at the Round Table restaurant there was very good. Make sure to take advantage of the coupon book you get when you check in, it's full of free and discounted items good on the property.

<Content>Better Than Expected Like some others, we won a 5 night stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island (courtesy of Smooth Jazz V98.7 in Detroit), but decided to tack on a couple of extra nights to our vacation. Since we wanted to see another island anyway, we decided to stay two nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Oahu. We stayed two nights in early February, 2004.I've stayed at a few world class resorts around the world, and also a few dives. The Hilton Hawaiian Village far exceeded my expectations and set a new standard by which I will measure other resorts.Yes, the grounds are sprawling and there is much to do both within the village and the surrounding area, but I want to focus more on their service and amenities - after all, isn't that what a luxury vacation is about ?I had read some other reviews that seemed to indicate the locals could be stand-offish to downright rude, so I got off the airport shuttle with an open mind, not knowing exactly what to expect. What I experienced, instead, was a very personable staff ready to assist me whenever asked. How refreshing ! Each employee I encountered seemed genuinely interested in making my stay a pleasurable one. Worthy of note was a middle-aged bellman named Patrick that met us as we got off the shuttle. Patrick was engaging  informative, and helped us decide where to dine our first night on the island. At check-in, a concierge inquired if anyone in line was a Hilton Honors member. When I answered up, my wife  I were whisked off to a speedy  painless check-in while others continued to wait in line (hint - join Hilton Honors on the web before you go...it's free and worth the effort). Our bags were already at our room when we arrived.As for the facilities, I must say this is a really large hotel, with several towers of rooms (some 3500 rooms in all!) sprawled about the 22 acre complex. I will leave it to others to recommend a particular tower at this locale - suffice it to say that the room was bright, cheery  clean, and nicely decorated. It does take a bit of orientation to learn where everything is and how to navigate around to different areas. I started feeling comfortable (translation = not lost) within a few hours of arrival.Unlike the Hilton Waikaloa Village, this hotel offered little amenities we missed when we moved to the Big Island....like complimentary coffee and direct Internet access (for a fee, of course). Drink all the (appropriately named) Hawaiian Paradise blend coffee you want - they'll bring you more with just a phone call. Want to book a tour ? Make a phone call to the concierge, or stroll down to the open air lobby and ask all the questions you like. Yes, they are extremely busy, but I never once encountered a hotel employee that was less than cheerful.If you offered me another week's vacation in Hawaii, I'd take the Hilton Hawaiian Village over any other. No, I don't have any affiliation with Hilton hotels - I'm just impressed enough with this particular location to offer an unsolicited review....something I don't normally do. Others may have had different experiences, but our's was utterly fantastic.

<Content>Exorbitant First, the positive side: the complex is attractive, many nice shops lie within easy walking distance; the view from the Tapa Tower commands an expansive view of Waikiki, Diamond Head and the ocean; restaurants such as Sergio's, and especially Bali-by-the-Sea, are excellent.Regrettably, however, I suggest that vacationers to Hawaii look elsewhere. Hilton Hawaiian Village (indeed all of Waikiki) is overbuilt, overcrowded and waaaaay overpriced. One senses that the resort's policy is to drain as much money from its guests, as often and for as long, as possible. At $280 per night (including tax), should you expect use of the HHV fitness facility? Of course not, it's an extra $12.50 per day, per person. Headphones during your workout? $4 more. A steam bath afterwards? An additional $8. HHV courtesy vehicles running to and from the airport? No, one must take a cab or a shuttle, at $25-35 including tip, each way. A 14 pizza is $30, a bottle of beer $6.If, despite the incessant profteering, you still want to experience HHV, I suggest that you trade into it if you have a timeshare, thereby saving almost $2,000. Then, find one of the nearby ABC stores, buy food and beverages at a fraction of the resort prices, and have meals in your room, going to a restaurant only occasionally. The money you save can go towards your cab fare and those $25 daily workouts.

<Content>Fantastic Holiday I won our holiday in a competition with a local radio station in Birmingham, UK. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower of the Hilton Hawaiian Village for 6 nights and the view from our window was breathtaking. After enduring a long flight we welcomed a clean and comfy room. Food and drink on the Hotel complex was expensive but the ABC Store on site was very useful for stocking the fridge in the room with drinks, snacks, fruit sandwiches etc. We found 'The Bus' very easy and useful to use being $2 adult and $1 child and you could get a transfer ticket to use within 2 hours, we travelled to the North Shore and watched the surfers on Sunset Beach and Banzai Pipeline. The trip to Pearl Harbor and the Arizona Memorial was enjoyable although very moving. The Ala Moana Shopping Centre was big with many food outlets and a wide variety of shops. We had an Intenational Buffet meal in the Rainbow Lanai which was enjoyable and meant that our children could eat free off the special childrens menu. All in all it was a brilliant holiday and would definitely like to visit again one day.

<Content>No doubt, the best location on Waikiki No doubt, it's a bit dated (we stayed in the Tapa Tower), but this has gotta be the best location and site plan on the beach. I used the city buses to go shopping when my husband and son were out viewing the ships at Pearl Harbor. Really easy! Bus drivers and local people are very helpful at which bus goes where. We enjoyed every aspect of the HHV, and service was great! The grounds have some surprising guests-- Egyptian ibis, black and white swans, flamingos, wood ducks, and penguins! You can easily find a quiet spot to read a book or enjoy a drink. No stress here.

<Content>Simply Fabulous This is my second stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and we are booking for next year. The staff is wonderful. All services are at your fingertips. I've travelled all over the world and this is one of the best hotels/resorts I've experienced. Can't wait to return. The individual towers provide a more personal touch than one would expect from a facility this large.

<Content>better than some say My first impression of this hotel was wow, what a relief. After reading several reviews on this website, I was a little worried...expecting maybe a Vegas like, cheesy Hawaian hotel. Upon turning the corner and entering the property, I was impressed by its appearance and ambiance. This is not only a hotel, it can really be a destination. Its a fun, upper-scale hotel that is pricey but this is Hawaii and so is everything else. While you drive up to the registration desk, you pass several shops and retaurants. I can compare this hotel I guess to a mega-cruise ship, everything you may need in a vacation in one place. The hotel itself has things everyone has already talked about, penguins, flamingoes...things like that. Its things like that that make this hotel a fun place. It is not your Ritz Carlton in elegance, but I was on my Honeymoon, and I wanted a nice, fun place to relax, swim and enjoy my vacation. All in all, I was very satisified with this hotel, its negatives are the $17.00 per day valet parking fee, and the inflated prices on everything else. Aside from that, its great. In my opinion, if you are coming all the way to Hawaii, save up and learn to part with your money, as it will easily slip away. If you can, rent a car. (it gives you the freedom to move around and see Pearl Harbor, North Shore and the other tourist locations)I am not sure if my review was helpfull, I can only write what I was hoping to read when I read the reviews. Calm your worries if you are booked here, it is a nice, family ( lots of kids) well designed place. Unless you are a travel critic that only goes to places to find the negatives of a hotel, and you go there, have a few drinks and enjoy your VACATION, you will like the Hawaiian village.

<Content>Best place we have ever stayed! We really lucked into the best deal! We had reserved 2 rooms, one for my husband and I and one for 3 children, 17, 15, and 11 for February break 2004. They were booked solid and could not even find 2 rooms in the same tower when we checked in. After a quite a wait, we were so tired after the long trip from Michigan, we were given 2 rooms on the same floor in the Alii tower. What a great room up grade! On the second floor, 4 steps from the private pool for Alii guests. We had a huge balcony, which had two reading chairs with ottamans, a table with 4 chairs and 2 patio recliners, over looking all the activities at the main pool and over the ocean. We saved so much money on the food served from 5-7 at the Alii pool and we did not have to pay for coffee. The kids were as far as they could be on the same floor but they are older so we were fine. Our balcony became our gathering spot for sun worshiping, book reading and card playing!

<Content>A great time at the Hilton! Our stay here at the Hawaiian Village (Feb. 18-21) was a lot of fun. There is so much to do in the village itself that you never really need to step off. The kids enjoyed the penguins and flamingos and found the location on the beach perfect. The only major negative thing, which was major, was that the pool closed up way too early for a resort. Some days it closed up as early as 3:30. Otherwise, I would recommend the Hilton if you are looking for an exciting stay in Honolulu.

<Content>Great Time!! We stayed at the Hilton 02/18-02/20 2004. It was great! My husband, 7 year old daughter and I were serviced right away upon our arrival and given an ocean view room in the Diamond Towers. The room was clean and had a great view!! Before we even got to our room my daughter wanted to stop and look at the flamingo exhibit and the penquin and turtle exhibit they had at the hotel. I thought it was a great touch!! The children seemed to love it. The only one bad thing I can say about the Hilton Hawaiian Village is that it is extremely expensive. For my husband, daughter and myself to go out to dinner it was at least $150/night, lunch was not any better as far as value goes...and drinks run about $8 each. The resort is gigantic so you kind of get lost in going to all the restaurants there...we didn't even leave the village. If you like Japanese food they have a Benihana on site and the food was great. My daughter especially loved the show the chefs put on. There are also about 90 great shops and upscale boutiques right in the pavillion. If you have the $$ I would definately stay at the Hilton, it was beautiful, the service was great and the beaches were calm and clean (although sometimes crowded). If you are a pool lover make sure to get there early for a lounge chair!! Otherwise you will end up paying $12 for one on the beach!!

<Content>Great stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village We recently stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for our 10 year anniversary and had a really nice experience. I was a little nervous after reading such mixed reviews about the HHV. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower -- initially in room 2920 (note: the even number rooms face downtown Honolulu and the marina not Diamond Head). We were immediately not happy when our neighbors arrived next door and we could hear their conversation word for word. We quickly went down to the house manager desk, explained we were on our 10th anniversary and requested a room change. Being the week before the Pro Bowl we thought we'd be out of luck (and I'm sure this review would have a different tone!) but we got switched to room 800 which was at the end of the Rainbow tower with two balconies -- one facing the ocean and the other facing the marina. It was so beautiful! And the fireworks on Friday night felt like they were our own personal show! The food in the village was o.k. Benihana was good. We ventured more into Waikiki for dinner just to get out and see other things. The grounds at the hotel were really wonderful. We wandered through many of the other hotels (the Royal Hawaiian, the Halekulani, Sheraton Surfrider) and the HHV was really overall the best. The pool is huge but that's about it -- nothing special. With all the buildings around it the sun exposure is limiting and we had to get our chairs by 9:00 AM or we were out of luck. Head to the beach if you want to be in the sun all day. I wouldn't recommend this pool if you like privacy. It's a typical big resort and not particularly romantic (but then again neither is the Honolulu/Waikiki area). We like to go there because it offers a slice of classic Hawaii and you can walk everywhere. Also if you want to get a cheap meal there are options. Overall, we will stay at the HHV in the future (mostly because we'll use our Hilton Honors points) and have a great time!!

<Content>Way overrated We stayed at the HHV February 15th and 16th. It was very dissapointing. We had a sorry room on the 4th floor. When we asked for a different room we were told by a rude and obnoxious clerk that the hotel was sold out. However, when I offered to pay for the upgrade, they miraculously found a better room (we did not take the room). You have to walk what seems like a mile to get to your room. The room itself was ok, but they charge you for inroom coffee. Most hotels we've stayed at offer inroom coffee complimentary.The stores in the HHV are very expensive as well as the restaurants (if you can get into a restaurant.) The drinks at the bars are outragous. $8.50 for a Mai Tai. We went across the street to the coffee shop. The same drink $2.50; breakfast was considerably cheaper (and better) at the coffee shop as well.We may return to Hawaii, but will never stay at the HHV.

<Content>We give the Alii Tower two thumbs up We stayed at the HHV for 3 nights beginning 02-09-04. When we arrived we thought, What have we gotten ourselves into? There were Huge lines in the main lobby--the longest we have ever seen in a hotel. Fortunately, we were booked into the Alii Tower, which is a short walk from the main lobby and has its own check-in desk. where we were first in line. If you read some of the other reviews or check the Hilton web site you will find the special features of the Alii Tower, so I will not repeat them here. While I will not dispute the experience of those who have given the Alii Tower a less than excellent rating, I can tell you that our stay met and exceeded our expectations in every way. We had booked an ocean view room with a Bounceback package. This included a buffet breakfast every morning. The room was large, well furnished, well kept, and had a great view. The breakfast was good (and actually better than at some of the much more expensive out island resorts). Every employee with whom we had contact was pleasant and courteous. As a bonus, the package was quite a bit less expensive than other Waikiki Hotels which we would feel to be of similar quality. So, we can recommend the Hilton Hawaiian Village--but only if you stay in the Alii Tower. We (my wife and I) give it two thumbs up and will definitely stay there on our next tip to the Islands.

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian Village is Paradise! We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village the week prior to the Pro Bowl and a few days after the game. It is a WONDERFUL place and would highly recommend it to others and we will definetly stay there again ourselves. It is truly a resort paradise with great shops and wonderful restaurants. The staff was really nice and very accommodating. You can easily stay at this resort and never have to leave, though we did drive to the North Shore where the beaches are beautiful and not crowded, and only a 20-30 minute drive away, as the hotel beach area was pretty crowded a couple of the days while we were there. The ocean at the hotel is great for swimming and snorkeling. We had a 1-bedroom oceanview condo in the Lagoon tower. This place is paradise!

<Content>Center of Pro Bowl Activities We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village during the Pro Bowl week in early February. Many of the players were also staying there which made for great gazing around the pool and beach areas. The Hilton was expensive but that is indicative of Honolulu in general. The quality of service and accommodations were great and the location is superb. I definitely would stay at the Hilton again.

<Content>My first time to Hawaii and at the Hilton Hawaiian... I have stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village twice now. My very first time to Hawaii I stayed here. I walked in and felt like I was in paradise. The service was amazing and the grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The name Village is just how you felt. Like you were staying in a village and didn't have to leave for anything. I have taken my husband with me to stay here and it was his first time to Hawaii also. I wanted him to have the same experience I did my first time to Hawaii. I highly recommend staying with the Hilton Hawaiian Village to anyone!

<Content>Aloha Ali'i! My third trip to Hawaii was the first that I needed to worry about accommodations. I did lots of research (and deliberating) and finally decided on The Ali'i Tower at Hilton Hawaiian Village. I found the Ali'i through the American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts program, and I highly recommend this program if you?re a Platinum or Centurion card holder. The perks (free room upgrade at check in, free continental breakfast every day for you and a guest, and a free lunch at the Rainbow Lanai) along with special attention from the staff make this hotel an enjoyable place to stay ? and a nice value.About Hilton Hawaiian Village: As you'll read in the many reviews posted on this site, the Hawaiian Village is huge. Five towers make up the compound (they?re going to build a 6th), and the beautiful grounds that connect them are immaculately maintained. You?ll have plenty to look at as you stroll the grounds: exotic birds (including flamingos and penguins), fish, and foliage are everywhere. The hotel employs a large staff to maintain all of these, and no detail goes unnoticed.HHV has many shops, most of which seem to be jewelry stores. You?ll find everything from a full Louis Vuitton boutique to an ABC convenience store to a DFS Galleria, so you don?t need to leave the village if you don?t want to.The beach in front of HHV is by far the largest in Waikiki. Just walk down to some of the other hotels, and you?ll be amazed at how small their beaches are. There was plenty of room at HHV?s beach, so we never felt crowded.You?ll find lots of restaurants either in the hotel towers or around the village shops. We ate most meals on site, and most of what you read about the hotel?s high prices holds true. For example, a 7-ounce filet mignon will run you about 40 bucks at the Village Steak House, and lunch for two at the Rainbow Lanai (without alcohol) can easily pass the $50 mark. But all hotels in Waikiki have similar prices. And besides, you?re in paradise, right? Who?s counting? Despite the high prices, you can still get reasonably priced food from the hotel?s more casual restaurants near the pools/beach area and from the independent places in the shops area.The hotel has many activities, ranging from a nightly hula show by the super pool to the Atlantis submarine. We were happy to lounge by the pool or beach most of the time, so we didn?t require too many distractions. But if you want to be on the go, HHV can easily accommodate.About Ali?i Tower: The Ali'i Tower is run like a separate hotel; guests have their own check-in area, a doorman, a dedicated concierge, a private pool overlooking the beach, and towel service by the pool. The pool area also has an adjoining lanai, where guests can enjoy, continental breakfast (free if you?re with the AmEx program), full bar service, snacks, etc...The rooms in Ali'i are larger and better than average. House keeping visits 3 times daily, including nightly turn-down service. Our room was on the 10th floor and had a view of the ocean and Diamond Head. Each room has a lanai (balcony) with two comfy chairs and a table. If you came to work, you have a desk with a color fax/scanner/printer (DSL is available for a fee). The bedroom TV tucks away neatly in the armoire, and the little TV in the vanity area of the bathroom comes in handy as well. The bathroom/shower is tiled in stone, with a pedestal sink in the shower area and a traditional sink/vanity area just off the entry to the room. Each room also has added conveniences like 3 telephones, an iron and ironing board, hair dryer, in-room safe, shaving/facial mirror, cotton balls, basic toiletries, etc.When not in our room, we found the staff at the HHV to be top notch. Everyone was very friendly and personable. The staff in the Ali?i typically addressed us by name, and they were incredibly gracious and hospitable.We had one complaint about our stay: The air conditioner didn?t seem to work well. I called the front desk, and they had maintenance check our unit and make repairs. We noticed some improvement, but still didn?t feel that the room was cooling as well as it should (considering we had the air on the highest setting). The front desk offered us another room, but when all was said and done, we just didn?t feel strongly enough about it to move pack up our stuff and move. The room was never uncomfortable, and we knew we could change rooms if things got bad (They actually had another room on hold for us if we changed our minds.)Overall, Hilton Hawaiian Village is a great property, and the Ali?i Tower was a fantastic place to stay. After reading so much about hotels on this site, I was a little worried because every property seemed to have a horror story associated with it. But I?d definitely recommend the Ali?i Tower at HHV to anyone, and I?ll be back the next time I?m on Oahu.

<Content>Great Getaway Hi! We stayed at the Hawaiian Village last Feb and are returning next week. Our time was spent relaxing at the spa pool and seeing the sights on the island. I had time alone and found the tours fun and interesting. The shopping at the mall was great and the staff were friendly. We enjoyed the performances by the pool, the beach and the walk way to all the other hotels and resturants. It was a great week!

<Content>Won't see us again Stayed here for 2 nights in July '03. Not impressed. Stayed in the Ali'i tower which is the only tower on the property that is part of the American Express Platinum Fine Resorts and Hotels program. They need to take it off the list. Whe we arrived it was like a mob seen at the front of the hotel. I swear I thought I was at a convention or something. At least they had people there asking for your last nme so I didn't stand in the long lines. I was sent immediately over to the Ali'i tower where there was no line and check in was indoors. The room was okay. Glad we had a private pool because the pool at the entrance of the resort, forget about swimming in there. All you can do is stand in the water and there is someone else standing at least 2 inches right next to you. Why even bother getting in the pool. Personally it was just to crowded for me. The Royal Hawaiian is much quieter and better service and a 5 star resort.

<Content>Great Beach Resort!!! Stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort from 1/24/04-01/26/04. As HiltonHonor member was upgraded for no extra charge from Tapa Tower to Rainbow Tower room#427 with view of superpool and beach. If you get a room at the Rainbow Tower, I'd recommend get the odd-numbered room for better ocean view.PLUS: Beach not overcrowded, exotic landscaping, and location of the hotel (away from the shopping crowd). Room was clean.MINUS: small bathrooms, parking $14/day, expensive onsite shopping stores and restaurants (The Rainbow Lanai: Breakfast Buffet $19.95/person is NOT worth the price; instead I recommend have breakfast buffet for $21.00 at the Plumeria Beach Cafe at KAHALA MANDARIN ORIENTAL HAWAII. It's the best in Waikiki: food selection and ocean view!!!)Overall, the hotel was wonderful because of the direct beach access, the nightly hula dance entertainment by the superpool, and landscaping with exotic birds.Will definitely come back to Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort next time!

<Content>excellent time Me and my partner stayed at the hilton hawaiian village in june. We had a great time, the hotel was a bit pricey but the resort is great fun. I loved the shopping in the resort, theres louis vuitton at your door step, endless souvenir and clothes stores and even a ABC store. I stayed in the ali tower and found the rooms beautifully decorated and very clean. I really have no complaints. The hotel has a private beach which is very peace full, if you like crowded beaches the other end of waikiki beach is best suited, where there are lots of hotels and activities on the beach. When we arrived we soon realised it was sale time and found that Gucci, Prada amongst others stores where 50% off which is great, in England sale time is very hectic, stores cramed full of people but to our surprise it was very pleasant and had a wide range of sizes available. I would definately stay at the Hilton again but as Im travelling from England its very expensive, 8 nights room only for two people has cost me 拢2200 (around$ $3300). I better get saving.

<Content>disappointed Disappointed best describes our stay at the HHV. I took my family to Hawaii to celebrate my wife and my 25th anniversary. We stayed at the HHV expecting it to be POSH but what it actually is, is beachy. We stayed there 12-28-03 through 1-6-04. Our room and taxes came to over $4,200.00. There are some nice features, but hoped for and expected more for that sum of money. The staff was friendly, but the HHV was understaffed. We had to wait in line for anything and everything. There are a large number of shops at the HHV, but virtually all are top of the line extremely expensive. We are planning another trip to Hawaii in July 04, but will not stay at the HHV. The reason is it is a very poor value. Mike

<Content>Great Place to Explore Oahu From Stayed from Dec 22-28, 2003. As a HHonors member using points for my stay I was pleased with the options given at check in. They were an Ocean View in the Rainbow Tower, a Jr. Suite in Diamond Head Tower or after asking about the Concierge Floor an Ocean view in the Kalia tower with access to the keyed off 23rd Floor. Traveling with my 12 and 9 year old, I opted for the free food on the conciege floor. The Kalia tower is about a five minute walk to the beach but the tower is new and certainly the nicest of our trip which included the Hilton on the Big island and the Radisson on Kaui. They provided a free role away so my kids each had their own beds. The Kalia Tower is convenient for grabbing the car from the $12/day parking garage across the street and exploring beautiful Oahu. The Concierge Floor was very comfortable and some evenings the Hors d'orves were pleanty for dinner. Breakfast was good, but not as extensive as some floors i have been on. The staff was great.The grounds are wonderful, and the Kalia Tower has a nice pool and whilpool only availble to residents of that tower. It is actually a very relaxing place to hang out. It is adjacent to the Spa. My wife had one of those $100 per hour treatments, but she said it was excellent. Something like a Massage with chocolate and Maccadamian Nut ScrubIf you are looking for water slides, there are none on Oahu except at a Water park about 30 minutes away. Kids wanted to go, but the natural beauty of Oahu was better.

<Content>What a Wonderful Place! We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiin Village 12/27/03 to 01/02/04. Everything was great! Our room was upgraded at check-in just for the asking. We did have to wait about 15 minutes to check-in, but they gave us complimentary buffet tickets ($90 value) because they knew it was taking too long. The Rainbow Tower was wonderful, it never appeared too crowded even though we knew the hotel was nearly full. The bell staff was exceptional, and the restaurants were very good. We look forward to staying here again.

<Content>very pretty My husband and I spent dec.15-21 at this beautiful resort. It was quite expensive but the ABC store was on the property where you could get alcohol and various necessities much cheaper. The staff was extremely helpful if or when you needed anything. My only complaint was the staff at the pool. The pool opened at 8:30am. Dont try to get a towel or just sit at the pool at 8:27am. You will get scolded and told the pool does not open until 8:30. that happened to me twice during my stay!!! Overall the experience was a very relaxing and lovely one at this resort.

<Content>Best Vacation Ever!!!Very Co$tly In Dec'02, I stayed at the HHV for 2 weeks. I stayed at the Ali'i Tower. I had a partial ocean. In order to see the ocean you had to stick your head outside the balcony to see the ocean. The room was ok. It wasn't very big but suited us fine. The AC leaked  they fixed it. The table cloth on the nite table was stained  when I requested they change it they did. You have to put a sign on the bed for them to give you new sheets everyday or they don't change them [water-conservation]. I don't think the Ali tower is their best tower to stay in. I looked at the Deluxe Ocean view Rainbow Tower while I was there  thought it was a much nicer room than the one we stayed in. The hotel grounds beach etc are kept immaculately clean. I would look out at the balcony 1 am  watch all the people cleaning the outside of the hotel  grading the beach. The hotel is a village. It has everything you need. That is what I like most about it. Everynite after dinner we would walk around to all the shops, enjoy the beauty  smell that surrounded us. The hotel smells very nice. There is a flower called tuberose that grows on vines  is all over the hotel  when the wind crosses it in your path it smells very nice. The hotel is a beautifully designed hotel that captures the essence of Hawaii. The open breezways at the check-ins  outside shops is just gorgeous. I had the best vacation of my life. The atmosphere set at the hotel was very traditional hawaiin. Friday nites there is a firework show  hula show. I think $10/pp  you get a sml pan pizza  a drink. You need to get there early to get a seat. It is a wonderful show.I like the HHV so much because it is a family resort. When you have children this is really important. There was a nice crowd of people  a homey feeling to the resort. They have penquins, koi,  very loud talking birds.Swans too. The employees were very nice. If you go during a holiday it is wise to make dinner reservations if you want to eat at the resort.If you attend a time-share presentation they offer a $100 hilton certificate.I would definately stay there again. While we were there, we looked at several other hotels to compare. I felt although this was a costly hotel, the resort atmosphere appealled to me the most.Other costs, $15/day for them to park your car.$7/hr if your child plays nintendo on the tv.breakfast for2 at rainbow lanai restaurant was about $45-$50. Lunch same . dinner about 100-150.Remember to bring alot of money. this 2 wk vacation cost about $10,000 [includes airfare, luaus at polynesian cultural center, sea life park, mall, honolulu zoo-very inexpensive. pearl harbor etc. I would highly recommend coming here. This is a prime resort.

<Content>Nice Place, Great Location, Poor Value Since we frequently travel with our young children (2 and 3 years old) we prefer to stay in condos. Hilton Hawaiian Village is (as far as I know) the only resort with condos that are virtually on the beach (on the lagoon in this case) in Waikiki without having to cross the street to the beach. We paid $299/night for a 1-bedroom condo. We decided to stay here for 3 nights before spending a week at the new Marriott Ko Olina, just to see what it was like since I had read so much about it.The condo was new but basic, however still pretty nice, especially when compared to an average hotel room. No laundry in room. Small kitchen and bedroom. Furniture was cheap.The resort is huge, several buildings, most with their own pool. If you go to stay in a hotel unit, make sure you are in the Tapa, Alii, or Rainbow towers. The other towers are in tha back of the resort away from the beach. Most towers have their own pool. There is a Super Pool in the middle of the resort, it is nice, but definitely not Super. Whoever named it has never been to one of a number of Las Vegas resort pools - those are Super Pools. This Super Pool was small relative to the size of the resort.The service at this resort is excellent - very prompt and very friendly and helpful. I figured out why this is.. evryone is probably paid pretty well based on the prices they charge here. $8.95 for hot dog and fries. $7.50 for a draft beer. What a joke.One plus of this resort is that there is a village with a variety of other shops and restaurants that are not part of the Hilton Monopoly so you can get a bit more for your money but not that much. In essence, we walked away from our three night stay with the conclusion that this place is a nice resort, especially if you want to be in Waikiki, on the beach, but, it is best summarized as a rip-off catering to upscale Japanese clientele (and conventions) that are not concerned about getting good value for their vacation dollar - everything is about 25% overpriced compared to other comaprable resorts we have stayed.I would look at some of the other Waikiki resorts for a bit better value and don't get sucked into the Hilton Allure like us and the mobs of Japanese tourists have. Better yet, if you want 4-5 star, go stay out at the Marriott Ko Olina. This is out new favorite place to stay.

<Content>Hilton Quality All The Way Stayed in an ocean view room at the Hilton Hawaiin Village in the Kalia Tower for 6 nights Nov 8-15, 2003. The room was very nice, quiet, comfortable and clean. I can't comment on the price value because I used Hilton points to pay for the hotel. Yes, things at the HHV are expensive, but hey you're in Hawaii, go for a walk. Within a few blocks and you can find anything you want at much lower prices. The Bus has a stop right at the property and makes in simple to get around the island. The beach is by far the the best in Waikiki and the hotel grounds are beautiful. Don't miss the Friday night polynesian show and fireworks at the Super Pool. Arrive early for a good seat. Stock up at the ABC store and you will save money. Take a trip to Hanauma Bay to snorkel. It is one of the best places in all of Hawaii. It's like swimming in an aquarium. This was my 5th trip to Hawaii and 4th to Oahu. In the past I stayed at other hotels but now I can't imagine not staying at the HHV. It is a true full-service resort that exceeded by expectations.

<Content>Tapa Tower was nice Stayed at the Hilton Hawaiin Village in the Tapa Tower 20th floor, ocean view on October 23, 2003. Room was very nice, quiet, with nice view. Not worth 260.00 per night though. Difficult getting elevator to floor due to conference. Had to pay for every little thing., Book all excursions using the coupon book phone #. Hotel charges fees to do it for you. Bus and shuttle services very easy to access at hotel. Hotel food was not good and too expensive. Eat off grounds and experience the Hawaiin Barbeque food. Hotel grounds are absolutely beautiful, beach was great, hotel is a little out of the way from all the shopping but wear comfortable shoes and take a walk to the shops. Malls were huge, Hilo Hatties was fun and can find lots of things. Buy Tshirts along the strip near hotel. Shop at ABC for snacks, drinks, etc. Go on the ATV's at the Kualoa Ranch but book early. Must snorkle at Hanauma Bay and request Dry snorkle. Go ISLAND HOPPING if you can, we didn't and friends said it was the best time ever and true flavor of Hawaii. Go to Germane's Luau -A+

<Content>Wonderful, but not romantic - not a honeymoon spot! My husband and I enjoyed our first three days of our honeymoon here before going to Maui. The hotel is wonderful, with just about everything you need on the property - but it is very croded and I would not call it romantic at all. Th erooms are big and beautiful, service was friendly, but not anyhting out of the ordinary. We had a suite whcih was nice - Th eview from the Rainbow Tower is excellent - we slept with the door open and al you could hear were waves - probably my favorite part! Great for a vacation of activity and fun, but not if you are looking for romance and quiet. It all depends on what you are looking for.

<Content>Loved it - going back for the third time Nice hotel for the money. Ask for an upgrade if it's not crowded. Enjoy the facility, but rent a car and tour the island on your own. We did the tourist thing the first time. They are helpful at the hotel, but to much commercialization once you get on the tours. There are plenty of small outfits that will help you find things to do on your own. We rented a vehicle and drove around the island to see what there was on our own and then made our own agenda. Plenty to do at around the island(s), then fill your time at the hotel. It's a bit of a walk to the main shopping (International Market area), but we enjoy the walk. It only takes about 10 minutes to get there. Overall we recommend it. We've been twice and are going back for the third time for Christmas.

<Content>Incredible Hotel! I goto Hawai'i twice a year, and every time I go, I stay at the Hilton. From the open-air, breeze-cooled lobbies in all of the towers, to the incredibly friendly staff, and to the vast number of different views one can get from each of the 3,500 different rooms, this is by far the very best hotel in which this world traveler has ever stayed. I've stayed in regular rooms, junior suites, full suites, and apartments in the Tapa, Lagoon, and Diamond Head towers, and I think my favorite experience is in the oldest of the towers, the Diamond Head tower. The view from the 16th floor toward Diamond Head is phenomenal, and the park below outside the Army RR Hotel, the Hale Koa, is a beautiful site as well. The Hilton is an amazing hotel, unless you're a recluse who doesn't enjoy other people...I'd suggest you go somewhere else if you're an introvert.

<Content>Had a Great time November 6 2003 We spent 6 days in the Alii Tower, We had a great view and enjoyed all the things promised inthe special tower I was a little concerned after reading the reviews but,our stay was wonderful. The only problem we had was on checkin the room we were given smelled so bad of smoke...even though they say it's a non smoking property. They quickly moved us to another room, which was fine...The food was just ok, nothing what you would expect from a Hilton property, and it was expensive but, you expect that anywhere in Hawaii. Overall though I would recomend the Hotel, everyone was very nice to us and we did have maid service 3 times a day, to replace free bottled water and fill the ice bucket and at night turn down service. Oh yeah, try the spa, they do a great job, my husband and I had a massage and facial together and then a jasmine bath , don't do the the bath, it wasn't worth it but the rest was... Very relaxing, loved it.

<Content>Nice but crowded A friend and I just got back from a 9 night stay on Oahu. We spent our first three nights at the Hilton Village before heading up to the MUCH more peaceful, relaxing, and beautiful north shore. But if you really like the crowds of Waikiki then the Hilton Village is a nice choice. You really don't even need to leave the village if you don't want to, they have everything you could possibly need. And they charge you for it! I was pretty shocked at the prices and I travel a lot and stay at really nice resorts. $7 for just a hotdog and $4 for a soda seems pretty crazy! When you look past the price for food, this resort has a lot to offer. When we checked in (early) we were upgraded to the Ali'i Tower because the resort was sold out. This business oriented tower has it's own pool and pool bar/caf茅. This was a major plus and I didn't feel so bad about losing our ocean view once I saw how crowded the super pool was. Besides the private pool, I didn't really see any of the other amenities the Ali'i tower boasted about. We didn't have our beds turned down once, no morning paper, etc. BUT, it was worth it for the non-crowded pool area that gave us a little peace in such a crowded place. Our room was nice and the bathroom area was great with an extra changing area with sink and fridge. The fridge was a huge bonus, we went to the onsite ABC convienence store and stocked up on soda, bottled water, yogurt, mixed fruit, etc. to help offset the expensive food prices. We tried a few of the village restaurants but nothing worth mentioning except the ice cream place! One thing not to miss is the poolside night show and the Friday night fireworks. We didn't pay for either so I'm not sure about past reviewers who said they did. Overall I would recommend this resort. Just be prepared for crowds and have a lot of extra cash to buy just about anything.

<Content>Hawaiian Paradise Just returned from a week at the Hawaiin Villiage and I am happy to say everything met my expectations. Without asking was upgraded to a sea view room at the Tapa Towers. All facilities were excellent and despite some reviews found prices reasonable. Talks of charges for sun loungers, etc was unfounded - the charges only applied to none guests. We would happily return when time and funds allow!

<Content>If your idea of fun is a shopping mall, this place is for you I stayed at the Ali'i Towers for the last 3 nights of an 11-day visit to Hawaii. We loved Hawaii but this place was the low point of our vacation. We were very disappointed. This place is very overpriced, but I can live with that if the experience was more pleasant. The service was OK but not great. They will charge you extra for for something every time you turn around which was very annoying given that the Ali'i Tower is very expensive in the first place. What was worst for us was that it was so generic, forget Hawaii, this hotel could be anywhere in America. If you want to experience Hawaii, save some money and stay someplace else. Our first hotel was 40% cheaper and 3 times better. I will not return to this hotel. Don't think it will be great just because it is a Hilton.

<Content>Enjoyed I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village on our honeymoon from the 20th June - 28th June 2003. We booked a room in the Tapa Tower which was a very large corner suite. The rooms were not to my taste, although large I prefer more modern hotels.The grounds were amazing but constantly crowded much to my annoyance. I'ts hard to enjoy a moment of secluded bliss in this property!We ate at all the restaurants in the property and although delicious (Our favourite was Bali By The Sea) they were far from inexpensive, now don't get me wrong but a bottle of standard wine in this restaurant will set you back about $80.00!Overall I didn't think the Hilton Hawaiian was up to my expectations. I have stayed in many hotels around the world and I have to admit I don't think you get what you pay for in this Hotel!

<Content>Wanted to stay longer Beautiful grounds! We could have spent a week at this hotel. We booked a mountain view room in the Kalia Tower and when we checked in, we were upgraded to ocean view. Lots of stores, good (but expensive!) food. Don't miss the torch lighting and hula show each evening at the super pool.

<Content>Wonderful place My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Hawiian Village twice during our recent 16 day vacation. This was our first time to Hawaii. We had a really nice ocean view room overlooking Diamond Head for 5 days and totally enjoyed our stay. Then we stayed in another tower for one day prior to returning to the mainland. Once again we had a nice room overlooking the ocean and Diamond Head. It was a pleasure to stay there and the price was very reasonable. We would Highly recomend this resort.

<Content>Good place to stay, but ... We stayed in the HHV vom Oct. 8 - Oct. 14, 2003 and enjoyed our time there. Due to the fact being a Hilton Honors member, we got upgraded one categorie which was nice and we had partial ocean view. Food and drinks are really expensive in the Hotel (even the coffee in the room is almost 4 US$!!!) but also it is very convenient to just go downstairs and have everything you need (various restaurants, bars, shops, public transportation, beach, several pools). 3 days of my stay I had to attend a convention.What I didn't like: information provided by the concierge has been terrible; of 5 information I needed none of the given answers has been corredct. I also had a cockroach in my room coming out of the space behind the refrigerator. I called twice to get my laundry picked up and nothing happened ... for this size of a hotel I think they need a bit more of organized people.Waiters and bell staff have been very friendly though. Would come again!!!

<Content>My ocean view was a tree We made reservations 3 months in advanced for an ocean view. The tower we're supposed to be in was full so they upgraded (and I'm using the term loosely) us. The view of was of the lagoon. We asked for a different room and got one facing diamond head. The only problem was this huge tree took up 75% of our view. The other 25% was of the other tower and the pool. They couldn't find any othe rooms because they said that they we're full (I think they rather have 1 angry guest than 2 if they gave this room to someone else). It's also a non-smoking room but you can smell the smoke. They tried to clean it but it didn't work. Don't let them give you room 425 in the Rainbow Tower. It has a very expensive view of a tree. The resort grounds and the room was very nice. Very expensive but there's the ABC store is close by for snacks and drinks. I might stay here again if they can guarantee me a real view. I might try the Mariott next time.

<Content>Tropical Paradise Stayed at the HHV 9/27-10/3. First time in Oahu for me, my husband and son. We loved the HHV. Upon arrival, the registration line was long. After standing in line a few minutes an attendant approached me and asked me for my name. He told me I didn't have to wait in line. I was registered in the Ali tower which has its own front desk and is closest to the beach. He showed me where to go and within minutes I was in my room. The Ali tower has its own pool, fitness center, concierge and door man. First class treatment. What gets costly is use of the hotel room bar. Water, sodas, etc. are high priced. I purchased my own water, soda and snacks and stored it in the additional refrigerator provided. The grounds are beautifully landscaped with waterfalls and tropical birds, even peguins, which my son enjoyed seeing on a daily basis. What I found really helpful was the concierge. I used them almost on a daily basis. They booked my activities and the hotel provides driving directions to each activity. This is one hotel that really catered to my needs at an affordable price and that's what a vacation is all about.

<Content>Busy and beautiful! Aloha! Visited Sept 24 - 28, 2003. The village is huge, flowers, birds! We were unsure of where to check in as our driver dropped us in the tour bus area, but the hotel is laid out so you are led right to the desk. Had drinks by the pool until our room was ready. Waitstaff volunteered to make the call to the front desk. We were shown to a marina ocean view room and asked for a beach ocean view. Staff was busy, but if we picked up the key we could change rooms. The room and view were excellent! The location is close but not right in the thick of things. You can find all you need in the village. Enjoy Friday fireworks show from your balcony or the beach! Mahalo

<Content>dissapointed! I came from the hyatt regency kauai, which was absolutely gorgeous with high expectations.. well they fell quite short of what i expected. The pool was mediocore but nothing compared to what i had just been at, the beach was ruined by hotels building up onto it. The room was just alright and i hated all the shops. I'd suggest getting off the waikiki strip if you can adn staying somewhere else.

<Content>Don't stay here If you think Wendy's is a first class restaurant or are afraid to go anywhere without an armed escort, then you'll love this place. But be careful -- you'll pay for everything! even a small bottle of WATER in your room is $3.50. What a joke.

<Content>Bumped on our Honeymoon! My husband and I decided to spend our last 3 nights in Hawaii on Oahu and chose the Hilton Hawaiian Village for its extensive resort facilities, spa services, and beachfront location. Imagine our horror upon arriving at the hotel to learn that we had been BUMPED from the hotel on our honeymoon because they were overbooked due to a drug rep. convention and that there were no other beachfront hotels available. The hotel staff was sheepish but refused our request to be accomodated on the property. We were placed in the Aston, which was neither beachfront nor a resort -- it's sole facilities were 1 bar/restaurant and a miniscule swimming pool. To add insult to injury we were told we could not even use the Hilton's resort facilities because they were too crowded. A call to Hilton's corporate offices finally resolved the situation: their corporate policy is NEVER to bump honeymooners, a policy not followed by the Hawaiian Village. The next night, the Hilton took us back at gave us a nice top floor suite, but nothing could make up for the response of the uncaring, unhelpful staff who did nothing but give us the run-around. Overall, the hotel is nice for Waikiki but not nearly as nice as many the resorts on Maui. Because it's so large, all of the facilities are crowded and getting a chair near the pool is next to impossible.

<Content>Another Great HHV Experience! My husband and I just returned from the wonderful island of Oahu, where we stayed at the HHV 8/30 through 9/6.I'll begin upfront by saying my husband is a diamond HHonors member and we stayed at the resort free of charge using his points. This was also our second visit to HHV, the first being at the Ali'i Tower in January of 2002.As before, valet service and check-in were speedy and very courteous. One minor check-in annoyance - three days prior to our arrival my husband emailed the HHonors rep at the HHV inquiring as to upgrade availability to the Ali'i Tower. He was told that we could upgrade to the tower for a fee but wouldn't elaborate. When we checked in we inquired again to the upgrade and was told the Ali'i Tower was not affiliated (?) with the HHV and didn't accept it's vouchers. I almost started laughing when she told us we could upgrade to that tower if we wanted to pay rack rate for the room - uh, no thanks!We wound up with a beautiful oceanfront room in the Rainbow Tower - room 1400. It had two lanais, once facing the end of Duke K. Beach and the other facing the marina with city views. It was beautiful! My husband and I generally stay at upscale hotels so, after reading other Tripadvisor reviews I was a little concerned about the room in the Rainbow Tower being old, musty and out of date. Not the case! To be honest, we sort of enjoyed the 50's kitschy feel of the room. When we first arrived, the outlet that the main lamp and TV came off of didn't work but maintenance was up in 10 minutes to fix the problem.As far as amenities go, my only complaint is that the towels are in dire need of upgrading...but I couldn't complain about too much more. We ran into a lot of people who whined and complained at the hotel to which I responded (more than once), Hey, lighten up! You're in paradise...you'll have plenty of time to complain when you get home.I've read several reviews here where people complain about the price of the food on the resort. My response? GET OFF THE RESORT! You don't have to go more than 15 minutes away to enjoy exceptional regional cuisine at Sam Choy's Breakfast Lunch and Crab, family fun at Old Spaghetti Factory or the world's most expansive food court at Ala Moana Shopping Center. My husband was an officer at Schofield Barracks for three years and knew where to go for non-resorty food...everyone who travels to Oahu should make the effort to get out and experience Hawaii because it isn't like any other states in the U.S.!The weather the week we were out was great...hot, sunny with just an occasional brief shower. One evening we enjoyed drinks and music at the Mai Tai Bar at the Royal Hawaiian and two evenings we spent at the elegant House Without a Key cocktail hour at the Halekulani. Both places had overpriced drinks but great views, great music and great people. If you're going to complain about $7 drinks, don't go to any of these places!The Tuesday evening of our trip, my husband and I dined at Bali By The Sea at the HHV. This was one of the most memorable dinners we've ever had! The food was great, the service was great...we had a wonderful time and the evening was capped off by a great post-dinner surprise (I won't spoil it for you if you go). We didn't make it to Bali the last time we were out so we made a point of going this time.I must say, the funniest anecdote I have to share is from Wednesday morning. After finishing breakfast (great free continental breakfast for HHonors members) we were headed back up to our room when the Super Pool opened. I swear, people were RUNNING to get chairs - it was hilarious! There are 100 chairs sitting around and a dozen people practically knocking each other over to get the prime spots. LOL!The beaches were crowded which was somewhat surprising but then again, our last visit there was in January when the weather is cooler (by three degrees...ha!) and less tourists are out. The Waikiki area is great for people watching and we have the pictures to prove it!The day before we checked out a major (and I mean MAJOR) pharmaceuticals conference was checking in, as well as the contestants for the Mrs. America pageant. I must say, the HHV reallly starts to slack off when they have a full house. From 2 p.m. Friday until we checked out Saturday getting anyone to get us fresh towels, check out our failing cable TV or vacuum our room was like pulling teeth. No one would answer the guest services phone and then once they did, you were put on hold indefinitely. Now, part of the problem I think was that day they had just reopened the Kalia Tower, which had been closed for over a year due to a variety of construction problems. Perhaps they weren't ready for the volume of guests but hey, they've been around for 40 years and really should know better.But, we had a great time and I always enthusiastically recommend this resort to everyone I know.Mahalo!

<Content>Better than ever On our 30th anniversary we went back. We took the kids and fell in love with the Village all over again. Nothing like it! walks along Waikiki in the morning, cool drinks along the beach during the day, and fantastic cocktails in the warm Hawaiian breeze before dinner. Paradise! The food at the upscale Italian Rest. was out of sight! The service was impeccable and everyone was friendly. We searched every store in Waikiki and found one right in the Village with the help of a friendly store salesperson. There is really no need to go anywhere else. We will be back!

<Content>paradise found My sister and her family live on Oahu in Lanikai. We go to Hawaii anywhere from 2-6 times a year. We got back yesterday and had stayed here. When we arrived they upgraded us to a beautiful room in the Alii Tower since they were sold out. I have to say this is my favorite hotel on the island. I even enjoyed it more then the famed Halekulani we stayed at last time. Grounds are beautiful and well manicured. If you go to Hawaii take my advise and go to Kailua beach. It's always rated the best beach of all the Hawaiian islands. You will not regret it!! Then there's a restaurant called Buzz's right there. You have to try a BFRD. Stands for BIG F____ RUM DRINK. It's a steak house and you wont be dissappointed here either!

<Content>Mediocre Hilton Hawaiian Village Family Vacation Family Vacation - August 12-23, 2003 - My family recently traveled to Hawaii (the big island and Oahu) flying from Baltimore. In Oahu, I booked a room through the Hilton Hawaiian Village many weeks in advance. It was touted as an ocean view room and the rate was $498.00 per night which is part of the Perfect Retreat package. This package includes coupons for the museum, dinner, and the Mandara Spa. Dinner at Bali by the Sea was so-so and this upscale restaurant actually overlooks an open casual cafe with a glimpse of the beach. Please note that the taxes on our room ran $56.00 per day, which actually cost us $554.00 per day.The location of our room was in the Ali'i Tower, however, the room was situated on the side of the hotel and above a street (alley) where we could hear garbage and delivery trucks, people, and on the week-ends a band. It was very noisy. The Hilton also seems to have a problem with pigeons landing on the lanai's and actually entering your room if your sliding door is open. We like fresh air as opposed to air conditioning when the temperature permits, so we were constantly chasing them off.We were very disappointed. My 11 year old daughter and I went to the Mandara Spa for manicures, pedicures, massages, and facials. The manicurist tried to charge me the 'adult' fee for my daughter, although there are specific charges for a 'child' (age 12 and under) manicure and pedicure. The facials were quite oily and unfortunately, caused the both of us to break out.Three weeks before our trip I called to extend our stay from 6 to 7 days because I discovered that the Hilton does a fireworks show on Friday evenings and I thought it would be fun. I was told that they were booked and wouldn't wait list me. So, I called every day to no avail.When we checked in we received the same story. So, my husband and I got on the phone and made a call to the Sheraton Moana Surfrider. We booked an ocean-view room for 2 days at $340 per day. (I didn't want to move to a new hotel for just 1 night) What a jewel it turned out to be! Our room was a true ocean-view room that was closer to the water. And surprise, surprise, no pigeons! The staff was personable and we three even received leis upon check in. The Hilton Hawaiian Village reminds me of a big conglomerate vacation vehicle. The property is huge with numerous towers. Regular parking is $11.00 per day and valet parking will run you $17.00 per day. Yes, there was a doorman to open the door for us in the Ali'i Tower and there was a separate registration desk. But, automatic doors work just dandy and registration could ultimately, do nothing for us for the extra day.The absolute kicker from the Hilton arrived in a letter delivered to our room on Thursday morning. Management had moved the fireworks show from Friday night to Saturday night (the day we were leaving the island)! Of course, just for that week only!The Sheraton Moana Surfrider was great. I only wish that I had originally booked with them and will do so when we revisit Hawaii.Sincerely,Andrea Hardy

<Content>Hilton Hawaiian is THE PLACE! We went to the Hilton Hawaiian Village on the first leg of our honeymoon. It was a spectacular resort, filled with more things to do than we could have imagined!They were wonderful to us, and we truly enjoyed the 22nd floor room that looked out on the ocean and Waikiki Beach. My husband is not a swimmer by an means, and he was in the water non-stop while we were there.Benihana's was terrific and right there, and definitely find out if the HHV is offering their coupon book with a stay. There were a lot of great coupons in the book and we used them all! Enjoy the open air bar where the music plays throughout the evening. It's a great place to just sit back and relax.We spent the first week of our honeymoon doing a lot of sightseeing on Oahu, and the second week on Maui -- a much needed change!

<Content>Hawaiin vacation at the Hilton Our dream vacation at the Hilton Hawaiin on June 22 was not quite what we expected! The staff was wonderful, the facility was beautiful, the food was yummy! However, our room (we had 2, one for us and the other for the teenagers) was left open from a window washer for about 4 hours! It was like, Come on in and take whatever you want! Thank goodness nothing was taken and we did use the wonderful safe in the room for $3.00/day. The Marriott in Fallsview Canada is a 5 star hotel and they charge nothing for the safe, and supply free coffee each morning! The Hilton charges $3.50 for the coffee and you learn quick to visit the ABC store for supplies! The other problem was the electricity on the wall that we shared with our kids. The lights and clock radio would go on and off, then finally off. When the repairman came they gave us two options; move to another room, or they could drill a hole above the kitchen sink and fix the box. We decided against both since we had 2 days left and didn't want to haul our stuff to who knows where. We had a hard enough time to get 2 rooms side by side when we checked in and requested this 6 months in advance! Plus the bathrooms had no exhaust fans so the mirrors steamed up fast. Later I was told none of the rooms at the Rainbow Towers had exhausts? They do nickel and dime you to death! Renting an umbrella for the beach at $23.00/day is rather pricey considering you are STAYING at that hotel! The other problem is the elevators weren't working properly. The doors wouldn't open when you reached your floor, you had to force the doors open by hand! Management was aware of all the problems! I'm unsure as to whether or not I would go back there or not for the pricey problems in the Rainbow Towers. The rooms were average at a cost of $189.00/night.

<Content>Convience and Style Our Hawaii Family vacation (July 28th, 2003) to Oahu included a few days at the Hilton Village. We also stayed at the Hilton Village on the Island of Hawaii, and we loved it there as well. Each is equally unique.We enjoy the Waikiki City excitement and crowds and yet the Hilton is placed in it's own nearby world, enabling it's guests to have a total experience of the hotel itself and the big city only just outside the hotel grounds. It is a perfect blend of complimentary amenities.The restaurants in the area are abundant, which was great because our vacation was not all about FOOD, but rather the wonders of Hawaii and spending quality family time together doing fun things. The beach at the Hilton is great... it is like being in a realtime magically modernized Norman Rockwell Painting...to be part of the many activities going on: The surfers, swimmers, boaters, fishers, readers, sleepers... it was a lovely place to park the family for the day of safe clean surf and relaxation or many activities (diversity and variety). Wonderful people from all over the world shared those days with us in this paradise land.I recommend renting an umbrella and loungers for the day and don't bother complaining about the cost... just do it! It makes life so comfortable and it is so sophisticated a touch to a special day. After all how many days are you going to experience this dreamy beach before all too soon it is back to your normal lives. It is nice to hold on to every memory from the vantage point of the well serviced shady canvas.It was the extra touches that the Hilton provides that really makes you notice that this is not the average hotel. For example there is a Hawaiian Show provided at the poolside at about 6. The staff was very nice and ever present.We loved our clean good-sized room which was an unexpected upgrade in the Rainbow Tower; That's how nice the staff is! The view was endless, the sounds of the ocean waves, the happy guests and the Hotel Restaurant Music way-down-there (the towers are tall) were really special. We slept with the patio door opened and woke up refreshed at dawn with excitement for the heavenly place we arrived at.We will stay there again on our next visit to the Waikiki area of the beautiful Island of Oahu and until then, this place will hold a part of our hearts.Mahalo to the Hilton.

<Content>Wonderful Facility The property itself is beautiful as was the staff. Birds flying all about, penguins, flamingos tropical plants, the pools, ocean, restuarants, shops all come together in a beautifyl setting. Stayed in the Alii Tower which had its own lobby to allow check-in and out. (Nice feature)They allowed us to check-in early and out late. Our room was partial ocean view overlooking the main pool and the ocean. The room funishings were new and the room makeup service excellent. (3 times a day) This tower had its own private pool, steam room, exercise room and bar which was nice. Also free poo poos every evening at the pool. Food however was pricy and we ate off the property a lot. We would definately stay here again and would highly recommend it to couples or families. FIVE STARS

<Content>10 stars! I have been to this hotel 8 times! It is my favorite on Waikiki beach and always keeps me coming back. 1st rate Staff, best location, best beach and (Most of the time) the 1st stop from the airport. They have Great restaurants right on the property. Just be sure to out and explore all of Oahu,as you could stay on the complex for days. Highest recommendation for a Waikiki beach vacation

<Content>Great Place to Stay Stayed 7/14-7/19 2003 Beautiful property, and friendly staff.The only thing that bothered me was the moldy smell in the bedroom. I believe it was from the air conditioning.It is expensive, too. They charge a lot for every little thing. For example, snorkeling at Hanauma Bay: Snorkle $2, mask $3.. (the experience: priceless)... At the Hilton, the mask and snorkle were $15.00. They even charged $7.00 admission to watch the fireworks display by the pool!As for property and staff, they were great. Very helpful and friendly. The property has its own beach, activities, and a great spa. You could easily stay there and never leave the property.Definitely one of the best and most beautiful hotels in Honolulu.I would stay there again.

<Content>LOVED IT-stayed concierge 3 nights-honeymoon WE absolutely loved this hotel! WE HAD A GREAT STAY IN OAHU...only stayed 3 nights--our last 3 nights of our honeymoon. The pool was great--the beach even better! I would recommend this place to anyone. We did not have a car...I would rent a car next time. Things we did...Pearl Harbor, Pineapple Plantation (cute but you could skip),  THE BEST OF ALL--we hiked DIAMOND HEAD! TOTALLY WORTH IT! We bought beer @ the local shops downtown  brought back with us in our cooler--we would drink @ the pool--rather than pay top dollar for their drinks. WE HAD SO MUCH FUN! CANT WAIT TO GO BACK!

<Content>Good hotel for family vacation  We just returned from a 7 day, 6 night stay at the Hilton Hawaiin Village. I was thrilled to be able to redeem Hilton Honors points to stay free of charge instead of paying $189-219 per night. This hotel has a great location on Waikiki Beach and is virtually a city in and of itself. The grounds are beautiful and well-kept, particularly the pools(there must have been at least 5). Service was pretty good  the staff friendly. There were lines and a few small hassles here and there. Food and drinks are not cheap but then again this is Hawaii. There must have been 20-25 restaurants on the resort and 5 high-rise towers where guests can stay. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower and enjoyed it. The room are not extravagant but they are nice, clean and comfortable. Hitlon should consider updating some of them with more modern furnishings. My family received an upgrade to an ocean view room at check-in. You can walk to the main strip on Waikiki beach in 15 minutes and there is frequent trolley service in the event you choose not to walk. I was surprised to find that Honolulu is as commercialized as it was, but the Waikiki Beach area(its touristy) and Hilton Hawaiin Village make it feel like a fun place to just chill. I'd recommend the hotel to families, singles, and couples on honeymoons. You may want to check into staying in the Alii Tower if you desire very nice accomodations. Each tower is different and provides its own level of comfort - just be willing to pay for it b/c nothing is free, not even the coffee and tea in the rooms. All in all, I'd return to stay at the resort. Lastly, don't forget to bring a camera because there are some really pretty places at the Hawaiin Village to shoot some memorable photos!

<Content>great hotel This hotel is wonderful, it is very expensive but well worth it, stayed there in June 03, the beach is very wide and uncrowded,good for swimmimg, all of the restaurants were excellent, would definately recommend the Italian restaurant but would skip the overpriced chinese one. Did find the charge to rent a beach chair and umbrella was overpriced as well as most of the resturants. We stayed in the Tapa tower. Room was clean and nice. Would definately stay here again and recommend this to anyone, all in all despite the high price it is worth every pennyt to stay at this hotel, yu will not be disappointed

<Content>Great 6 night stay with kids! Great stay at Hilton Hawaiin Village1. Spent 6 nights there using my HHonors points, asked for an upgrade and got a great room in the Tapa Tower. My kids (7,9) loved it. Its very kid friendly. Inexpensive dining options if you want them. Its the only place in Waikiki to stay. The rest of the beach is narrow and crowded. Try the plate lunches off the lunch located out in the public parking lot in front of the lagoon, great plate lunches!

<Content>Loved HHV We just returned from our vacation on July 2. We have stayed at other hotels in Waikiki, but HHV receives our highest rating yet. It is within walking distance to the heart of Waikiki, but far enough from all the traffic and noise from the 18-20 year- old crowd. This is definitely a family resort, which we truly loved since we have two small children. The shopping, restaurants and entertainment were excellent. The private beach was wonderful with plenty of water sports available. We stayed in the Tapa Tower and had a wonderful view of the city and ocean. We will definitely return to this resort every time we vacation in Oahu.

<Content>Hotel was okay but overrated I was disappointed with this hotel. I thought I had done my research and ended up choosing this hotel because I wanted to stay in paradise. First of all, not all towers are created equal. We ended up in the diamond head tower and it was very disappointing. Our room was on the third floor, at the very end and our balcony looked out over the delivery trucks. The delivery trucks beeped when they were backing up and this beeping would start at 6:00 am every morning. We asked for a different room to no avail. They claimed to be completely full. A cruise ship's A/C had broken down so the hotel was full of all these cruise ship people while the boat was being fixed. The service at this hotel was so-so. One afternoon we were taking a nap and we heard a key jingling in our door and some guy came walking in (no knocking!!) to clean our windows. People should knock before entering a room. We got a statement the day before we were to check out with our incidental charges. You're supposed to get those the morning of check out. So, we had to go downstairs and pay those charges and then re-check in for our final night. ?? I've never had to do that before. It took about 45 minutes of my morning because they had a bunch of new people in training working the front desk. It was irritating. The grounds were beautiful and the adjacent beach was large. The pools were nice but very crowded. If you didn't go claim your sunny spot by 8:00am you'd end up with lounge chairs in the shade. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again because I was so disappointed with my stay. My suggestion is to specify what tower you want. I do not recommend the diamond head tower. I thought it sucked. The hotel shouldn't put people in rooms overlooking the delivery area. Definitely do your research!!

<Content>Paradise Stayed at HHV on recent June trip to Hawaii. I am an owner in the HGVC so we were in the lagoon tower. But, the entire staff of the village were very friendly and helpful. This is truly a village and you don't need to leave, they have everything. The stretch of beach by the HHV is by far the best part for sand and fun on Waikiki beach. The only complaint, and it is very minor, if you are a pool person and not a beach person, the pools are not very big, however, you do have a whole ocean at your doorstep. Would recommend to anyone.

<Content>Loved the Hilton We stayed there 2 years ago. The property was beautiful. Our daughter loved the fish ponds. We stayed in the Ali'i Towers. The view was fantastic. We would definately stay there again.

<Content>Great Resort and Service Our family stayed at the Hilton on May 24th through the 28th, 2003. We stayed in the Ali'i Tower and since the Ali'i Tower has a private separate registration desk, we didn't have to wait in a long line for check in. I asked to be upgraded from a garden view to an ocean view and they kept our luggage and gave us three room keys to view the rooms to make our decesion! Wow, that is service! We easily made our decesion and had a beautiful room with a great view of the pool and ocean. The room was very nice and has a mini tv in the bathroom along with two sinks. They had service three times a day. Also, from 5p.m. to 7p.m. they had appetizers for everyone in the Ali'i tower by the private Ali'i pool. The resort has all kinds of shopping along with several great restaurants. You never need to leave unless you want to sightsee around the island, which I highly recommend.The wildlife, (penquins) etc. were so neat to see. Also, they have free classes for lei making, and hula lessons. Every night they have a short neat hawaiian show by the pool.This is a great hotel for the family and I highly recommed it especailly in the Ali'i Tower.

<Content>Stayed in the Diamond Head Tower Me and my family jut got bacl from the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The grounds were amazing. I had never seen so many exotic plants, trees, and flowers. Our room was in the Diamond Head Tower. The room was awesome, we were on the 11th floor with views of an enormous tree garden, Diamond Head volcano, and views of the ocean. I would recomend this hotel to anyone going to Hawaii.

<Content>Loved the Tapa Tower Stayed 6 nights in the Tapa Tower during the Spring Break (April 2003). This was our 2nd stay at the Tapa Tower and we loved it. Our room faced the park (a lower rate), however we could look down and watch our sons in the pool. The Tapa bar had nightly music and the Hilton had daily drink specials (ie Pina Colada) for $5. The tower is closest to the street and we were able to walk across the street to a local coffee shop for breakfast @ a 1/3 of the price of the Hilton. In the Tapa Tower is the bus stop where a free DFS bus takes you downtown to their store where you can walk in and walk out and you are in the middle of Waikiki. Love the Tapa tower.

<Content>A Touch of Class This hotel won me over from the minute we arrived.The place is immaculately kept - the setting is naturally stunning - and the staff were helpful and friendly. We stayed in the Tapa tower and had a very spacious corner room for me, my wife and 2 children. I still can't believe how large the room was.The facilities were excellent and we can't wait to come back here. I have started saving up but any donations will be gratefully accepted!!!If only all hotels were like this.

<Content>First timmer to Hawaii This was my first time to Hawaii and staying at the Hilton was great. The rooms and service were outstanding. I would recomend it to any one. The only thing that I thought was a little disturbing was the price of there drinks. But I guess you have to pay to play. There were other place neare by that were less expensive. I would highly recomend it

<Content>Loved the Hilton Hawaiian Village My husband and I attended a wedding at the Hale Koa hotel next door and thought the Hilton Hawaiian Village would be a great place to stay because of it's locale. After researching the hotel we decided to stay in the A'li tower, it was a brand new tower at the time. It was luxurious but didn't have much of a view. Next time we will probably stay at one of the other towers. The hotel itself is gorgeous, the beach area is decent. The hotel does have alot of unexpected charges, but I would still recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Loved the Hilton Hawaiian Village We stayed at the Rainbow Tower and the view was amazing! I still take out the video camera to remember...The hotel grounds are beautiful and you can walk right out onto the beach. The pools were wonderful and I enjoyed walking around the various shops in the village. The ABC store is close and so are various restaurants. We walked down the beach to a fabulous restaurant called the Shorebird...it was GREAT! Rent a car and drive around the island...check out the WWII monuments. It was a wonderful stay and we will come back to this hotel on our next vacation to Oahu for sure!
