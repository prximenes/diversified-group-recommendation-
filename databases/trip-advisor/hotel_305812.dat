<Content>Value for Money Four of us stayed two nights at the Kimberley on a stop over to Australia. I stayed here in 2005 with my sister and the hotel is as good now as it was then. It's in a brilliant location in Kowloon, just off Nathan road, ten minutes walk from the Star Ferry and 10 minutes from the night market. The buffet breakfast is fantastic, you can stuff yourself stupid if inclined for 拢15 per head on anything from beautiful fresh fruit to noodles or english breakfast. Evening buffet at 拢35 also good value help yourself until you pop and wine and beer included. But there is also plenty of good food to be had nearby. Rooms are cosy! but clean and comfy bed, shower in our room old but my sister's was brand new. Really recommend this hotel for VFM.

<Content>A Great Hotel in the BEST Location The Kimberley Hotel is in a fantastic location off Nathan Road one of the main streets. Its close to everything including the metro, cafes, market and lots of shops. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean and have all facilities. We stayed here for 2 nights on a stopover from Europe and was pleased with the accommodation and most of all the location. I would highly recommend the hotel and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great location in southern region of Kowloon. This is an unauthorized review of the Kimberley Hotel in Hong Kong. Firstly, I have to emphasize the great location. It's a short walk to Nathan St. (major north- south street that bisects Kowloon), it's a short walk to the metro, it's a short walk to the bus line (on Nathan St.) and of course it's a short walk to many restaurants and bars etc....which really isn't saying much b/c there's food everywhere. You'll never be hungry in Hong Kong. It's geared for tour groups and business people. The hotel itself is nice, but dated. My room was very small, with a queen bed. The bath room was small as well, but clean. I wouldn't say the room was 'cozy', it was just 'adequate'. If you want a hotel where you can rest your head a bit, bathe, watch a little telly and then go out.....this is your hotel. If you're more inclined to spend quality time in the hotel, taking advantage of it's amenities.......you maybe disappointed. The breakfast buffet was okay , some variety for the western and eastern fare. I never had much contact with the staff, besides check-in and check-out. The saving grace for this property is the location.

<Content>Ideal Hotel I stayed at the Kimberley Hotel for 6 nights. I took the option of booking the airport to hotel bus which dropped me off right infront of the hotel. Porters took my bag to my room, while I checked in at reception. The staff were friendly and spoke English very well. I was on the 19th floor which was very quiet and eaily accessible by the hotel elevator. My room had a double bed, tv, shower/bath, fridge and coffee making facilities. I'm surprised at previous reviews stating that the rooms were quite small, as although I was the only one staying in the room I found it to be quite spacious. The tv has a number of channels including many english channels. The hotel is ideally located to access the MTR, about a 5 min walk. The harbour can be reached in about 15 mins. As a young, single female traveller I found the neighbourhood to be very safe even when coming home late at night. The only downside are the Indian men along the street who hassle you by wanting you to go to their tailor. Best thing to do was to ignore them or simply say no. The price of catching the train from the nearest station from the hotel to the airport was $90HK, however for convenience I took the bus from outside the hotel for $100HK and I was there in just under an hour. Overall I would definately recommend the hotel and will stay there again.

<Content>Great location We stayed at the kimberley for 3 nights on the way to Australlia and were quite impressed. The location of the hotel is its main draw, right in the heart of the city and a short walk to everything. Whilst not the most luxurious hotel we stayed in, the hotel has eveything you need for a comfortable stay ( except a pool) Although the maids were keen to clean and we were woken by them 2 days in a row, despite do not disturb signs.

<Content>ok hotel but bad service stayed here with my girlfriend and her sister for 16 nights..from the very first moment at check in there was rude and unhelpful service at the front desk..we were given the wrong room for a triple,only one double bed and a sofa for a third person which we forked out an extravegent amount of money for..rooms are ok,bit small but nevertheless ok,plumbing is a problem,room service is slow and sometimes need reminding.breakfast is pretty good as is the lunch..wouldnt recomend a 2 week stay there,ok for a few nights stopover if you dont mind rude and arrogant service especially at the checkin counter..we were the target of a broken glass door in our room which we didnt do and they tried to make us pay for but didnt work..location is fantastic which is the only thing good about the hotel..beware of the ladys of the night roaming the outside and foyer at night looking for money in return for massage (sex)

<Content>Location, location,location! Stayed at the Kimberly for three nights in December enroute to Australia.Yes, the hotel is a little tired but overall found it to be clean and comfortable..The maid service was very helpful and they attended promptly to any requests we had.The breakfast buffet was a very good selection . Overall all service at this hotel was great.. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is centrally located for tours, shopping and is within walking distance to station and star ferry.Taxis are easily caught outside and restaurants and small supermarkets abound.Our room was quiet and had an interesting view of the street below.We had two children with us and were able to make use of an interconnecting room.Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great value,good position Just back from 12 days in HK staying at the Kimberley. All the public areas of the hotel have been renovated, the rooms have been repainted and wall papered and the bathrooms have had a make-over. However the room furniture looks tired and the carpets need replacement, but everything works and the place is clean. Service is fine, the desk staff helpful and no supprises on the bill.Room sizes are on the small side but this is HK. Bed was hard but housekeeping supplied a soft overlay which improved things.When booking, include the breakfast option. The full buffet breakfast is great value. They also have an evening buffet dinner which is good and includes wine and beer.Position is handy in Kimberly Rd off Nathan Rd and a short walk to the MTR. We were on the 12th floor at the front and the room was very quiet. There is a 7/11 store across the road and a Welcome Supermarket down the street on the opposite side. Many small resturants nearby. Try the Nomad mongolian bbq.A good value mid-range hotel with no problems.

<Content>take your carpet cleaner! We stayed at the Kimberly hotel for seven nights in March.The room was a good size-with a sofa bed for our seven year old son.Room facilities were good with coffee/ tea making facilities, fridge, hairdryer and the maid service was excellent. Overall the furnishings were a little shabby and well worn. However, the carpet was filthy- you really need the slippers that are provided. I don't want to dwell on trivial detail too much because the selling point of this hotel is its location. Its in a quieter side street off Nathan road with two excellent restaurants opposite-Cantonese and Japanese. It really is in the heart of Kowloon-close to shopping (though you're never far away) markets, museums, transport links etc.

<Content>A Ok Hotel I stayed there for 15 days at the end of Feb. I had no problem with the service, the staff was generally helpful, no attitude that sort of thing. I booked the first 11 days through a travel agency prepaid and added on 4 more days and had no problem with that, i.e. no outrageous rates, bill problem at checkout...etc. However I would agree with some of the reviews that the rooms are getting a bit old, you can tell the wear and tear, it was kept very clean, just not new anymore, the carpet was a bit worn thin, there was some small patches on the wallpaper. The bathroom looked to be newer with the new shower stall with the glass, not the cheap curtain. Overall it was good for what I had to pay for it.

<Content>Great location We stayed here for three nights as a stopover. We found the hotel to be clean, easy to find and in a great location. Only a short walk to the MTR station, which means that you had access to the rest of Hong Kong (including the Airport). Rooms were comfortable and had everything that we required. Would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>New Years Eve This hotel is off main drag, but this advantage means no major traffic noise. The Foyer is on next level and over enthusiastic bell boys can be a nuisance. Close proximity to metro stations and harbour and shopping.Staff in restaurant cannot wait to clear tables at breakfast and again this can be a nuisance.Just beware of plumbing.

<Content>Absolutely fantastic I orignially booked into a hostel to save money in Chung King Mansions but 5 minutes there and I was bawling and having a massive fight with the manager because it was a prison cell and wrongly advertised on the internet. I managed to get into the Kimberley which was a fantastic change to staying in hostels. I was on the 22nd floor and was treated like an absolute queen. The only negative was that you had to pay to use the pool and spa facilities which is the lowest level but I just used the gym and took advantage of having two tvs for one person. It was a bit costly, but im sure if you booked over the internet you could get it for ALOT cheaper than i got it, but at the time I was willing to pay ANYTHING.

<Content>Good value, great location The Kimberley Hotel is really well located, just off the main Nathan Road in Kowloon, a few minutes walk to the Star Ferry terminal for Hong Kong Island, very close to a metro station and surrounded by shops and restaurants. So convenient for getting around.We stayed here a couple of times (in 3 different rooms). Its true the rooms are compact and you shouldn't expect a view, but then this is Hong Kong and the Kimberley represents really good value for the area. All 3 rooms we stayed in were clean and well equipped. We now recommend the Kimberley to people we know going to Hong Kong and will definitely stay there again next time we go.

<Content>Kimbley fits the bill We booked a standard room at the Kimberley for 1 week in September 2007. Yes, the rooms are small but they are functional and clean. We had enough cupboard space to store both our clothes and our purchases. Breakfast was included in our tariff and the menu catered for all tastes. One night we ate from the 'all you can eat' seafood smorgasbord but we were a little disappointed with the taste of the seafood compared with what is available in Australia. However, the giant crab claws are something to behold.We found the staff courteous and willing to help. On finding that our allocated room was on a smokers floor, the reception staff willingly changed it to one more to our liking. This took a little time to reallocate but the wait was worth it in the long run.The only negative is that many of the rooms do not have a safe in which to store passports and travel documents. However, staff at the reception desk will house these documents until needed.One of those much maligned tailors directed us to this fabulous eating mecca consisting of a row of some ten restaurants serving cuisine from all over the world. The site can be accessed from the Kimberley by crossing the road and heading towards Nathan Road. About 50-100 metres along and in between two shops, there is an alleyway on a steep incline - it is only a short distance. Once at the top, you enter a different world away from the hustle and bustle of the street below. The Italian restaurants are well recommended.We were looking for a hotel that was functional and clean that allowed us to sleep and clean up for our next adventure in Hong Kong - The Kimberley met that need.

<Content>Great Location Felt I had to write a review of this hotel. We stayed here for 3 nights on our way to Australia. I have read many reviews that are critical of the room sizes. I must have been very lucky as the room we had was very large, very comfortable and clean. The staff are not the friendliest in the world, but they are pleasant and efficient. We ate one night in the restaurant, food was good. The location of the hotel is great. Getting to and from the airport very easy. Take the train to Kowloon station and there is a free bus to the hotel. You will find this service on the ground floor. All well signposted. The hotel is within walking distance of all the attractions and shops. The only quibble I had was the shop owners, mainly tailors, constantly trying to get you into their shops. Very irritating. Easy walking distance to the star ferry. Dont bother with the expensive harbour tours, just use the ferry to get around. All in all a good priced, comfortable hotel and a good location for exploring and shopping.

<Content>Kimberley not for me On previous visits to Hong Kong we have stayed at the Park Hotel but this time we thought that we would try somewhere different, the Kimberley.The room was small and the bed was like concrete. I don't expect realy soft beds but this would not do. We rang for a comforter to soften it up a bit and the service was very efficient but alas the comforter made no difference.Our room looked directly onto the golf driving set up so we had to keep our curtains closed most of the time. The front desk struggled with English so we ended up finding other avenues for directions and information. The breakfast which we included in our hotel costs were very good and the staff extremely pleasant. Im am heading off to H.K again in September 2007 and have already booked in to return to the Park Hotel as there renovations will be finished by then.

<Content>will never stay there again Stayed there for 2 nights .. the first negative issue I had when I walked in , the concirge staff were watching me dragging my luggage and no body seems to even care or help , the second issue rooms are small and the funiture is outdated , Third , the broadband internet is a terrible pus you had to pay HK $ 120 for 24 hours  too expensive ; fourth , the Hotel staff are not friendly at all , it hardly you find somebody smiling ; and finally , long Que to check out and then they charged 2 in house movies in my bill which I didn't buy , and when i tried to complain to the front disk , they are not intersted to listen and i didn't have time to argue with them ... I recommend if you decide to stay to disable the in house movies it is totaly rip off

<Content>Central, Cheap, Clean  We stayed here from 11 June 07 for 4 nights. This hotel was very nice and if you are able to carry your bags across a road you can get the airport shuttle bus, which is very cheap and the fastest route. The hotel reception is on the second floor, however, the bell desk take your cases off you and seem to know exactly what room you are in without asking for any info(?!) Check in was really easy and our cases arrived 2 mins after we got to our room.I thought the room size was ok, not huge, but this is Hong Kong! Space for a bath in the bathroom, a great shower and plenty room for 2 cases. There was no safe in the room, but rather than leaving our stuff in the reception safe, we just locked our suitcases. The hotel is very central, 2 min walk to Nathan Road  the underground, 10 min walk to the star ferry. I would definately stay here again, it's cheap, central, clean  comfortable.

<Content>kimberley A-OK We stayed at the Kimberley Hotel at the last week of April.The room was clean,the bed linens crisp and the bathroom spotless.For the price we paid,this was a great deal!It's location was near to 7-11,and shopping galore along Nathan Rd, Cameron and Granville St.. Just near the hotel is a money exchange dealer who gave us a good deal for our U.S. dollars.The MTR stations were just a block away.all in all i would recomment this place to all.the room is rather small but for its price and strategic location, i can overlook that aspect.

<Content>Good Location but... This is my 3rd time to HK and 2nd time staying at TST. I love to stay at TST... It is a place with good food and great shopping.Location:Thus, Kimberley Hotel is very well-located. It is just a 10min walk from the MTR... I would advice travellers to walk into those small roads/lanes/streets instead of walking along the big main road (i.e. Nathan Road). All these small roads/lanes/streets have loads to offer. The Addidas shop along Granville Road has great offer too.There are a few coffeeshop opposite of the hotel for breakfast. Cafe de Coral and Maxim are also nearby. Famous restaurant like Sweet Dynasty (directly opposite of Habour City) and Macau Restaurant are also within walkable distance.A negative point to be taken is the fact the big buses (i.e. those buses to airport) could only stop opposite of the hotel. Raining days will make loading/unloading of luggages tedious. Thus, please get the porter to help in loading the luggages when the bus to airport has arrived.Room:The room size is small but should be sufficient for 2 persons with luggages. But the room especially the bathroom does show signs of aging. It would be great if the management could plan for some renovation.Service:Staff are friendly and willing to assist. But don't ever ask them to introduce places for dim sum. The place that they suggested me to go for dim sum was a nightmare. It was the most TERRIBLE and YUCKY dim sum I ever had in my life. For dim sum, just go to teh chinese restaurant at Miramar Hotel... it won't disappoint you but it's expensive.

<Content>Don't let the bed bugs bite... The hotel at first is pretty ok, until the bed bug incident.The rooms are clean but pretty small in the standard and superior twin sharing room, not much space to move around. The bathroom is clean, and they provide towel and everything you needed.Hotel is located in a busy street, with a convenient store beside and more in the corners, there are lots of shops around the hotel that operates till midnight. MTR is around 4 blocks away, very near but going back to the hotel is an uphill road.Service is very friendly and all staff speaks english.The bed bugs... well, I think it's a case by case basis, my mom did not get the bugs in her bed, only mine, though the staff were nice enough to changed the bed when I told them about the bug incident.Over all I think it's a nice hotel if you are going to stay in kowloon side of Hongkong, and if you are not looking for a luxurious room, but rather a cozy small place to sleep in then this is the hotel for you.

<Content>Top Marks for Kimberley We had three nights here and they were perfect, the location was just right, a stone's throw from the main street. Very helpful staff and the food was great,A very comfortable hotel and we would go back there again.

<Content>Fabulous hotel! My husband and I stayed in the Kimberley Hotel for 2 weeks and it was just wonderful! We had a double room that was a strange triangular shape but this squeezed every last bit of room out of a hotel in a city where space is at a premium!We had all our breakfasts and a lot of our meals in the bar or the restaurant and the quality, choice and attention of the staff couldn't be faulted.I'm actually having cravings about going back to this incredible city and fabulous hotel - I am amazed it is only 3 stars but that does make the price very attractive!I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Hong Kong, especially as it is in the centre of Kowloon, easily the most exciting part of the city!

<Content>Great Location Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Kimberley. We could not find any faults with this hotel at all. The location couldn't have been better, easy walking distance to Star Ferry, Nathan Rd and Temple Market. Lots of dining choices across the street at the Knutsford complex. The buffet breakfast was good with many choices. We found the beds to be comfortable not overly hard as often posted here. The rooms are a bit small but there is a nice marble shower and a soft duvet on the bed for a nice little touch. We would most definately tell our friends about this place.

<Content>Loved the Kimberley! This hotel is great, especially for a 3 star. Great location - really close to Nathan Road (main road), shopping, ferry terminals and all amenities. It's also very well known by taxi drivers and the free shuttle service from the Kowloon Airport Express terminal, which is very handy! Staff very friendly and helpful. I found my room plenty spacious enough and spotlessly clean. Beds do have fairly hard mattresses, but I found them very comfortable. Rooms also have air conditioning and temperature control, so all in all, it's easy to make yourself comfortable. I couldn't have asked for any more and thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.

<Content>Great Location, very basic hotel We have a young family and travel a lot from Australia. We have been to Hong Kong many times but it was our first at the Kimberley Hotel. Our travel agent had put in two requests to ensure we had inteconnecting rooms and on arrival when I enquired that this was the case, the staff assured me that we had inteconnecting rooms. We then found that the rooms were across the hall and therefore my husband and I had to sleep in separate rooms for the 10 nights. We paid to sleep 3 in each room and the first room only slept 2. So we had to sleep 2 children in one fold out bed, which was not very comfortable.The breakfast was fine and the service ranged from acceptable to poor. We requested a late checkout to compensate and were refused so had to pay a fee. I have always found every where in the world that our accomodation was great. This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at due to its small, old rooms and very poor service. I would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone. We will be booking into the Miramar next time, as when we went to just to get a brochure their efforts to please seemed to be a wonderful indication of the quality of their hotel and service.

<Content>Nice Hotel I was concerned after reading some of the reviews on this site, but the hotel was much better than I had imagined.My room was of a reasonable size, a standard double room, nicely decorated, with bath robe and slippers supplied. The bathroom was clean and the shower was wonderful, pulsating and very relaxing after a hard day sightseeing.The location was perfect, handy for all shopping areas and close enough to get the Star Ferry for Hong Kong.

<Content>Ok but maybe we were spoilt before we arrived Ok - to start, we went from an upgraded suite in Bangkok, to a perfectly located hotel in Sydney, to lazy times in Hamilton Island to paradise in Port Douglas - therefore, a central, average hotel in the centre of Hong Kong will bring us down with a bit of a bang, especially after 15 hours of travelling to get here!However, the hotel is fine! The rooms were clean enough, could probably do with a bit of a lick of paint but we were in the basic room so what??? Recommend the lounge for a nice beer and snack - lets face it, anywhere with a happy hour 4.30 til 7.30 cant be too bad!!!Warning about Hong Kong though - you think you are going for tax free bargains....prepare in advance for what you want and I think you will be ok! I went blindly looking for a camara and are not too proud to say I was probably diddled! Probably paid the same as the UK for a top notch camera (and it is just that) when I thought I may have been getting a bargain! Know what you pay in your home country and walk away if you cant get it cheaper, its not worth it and the sales people know what they are doing too! Recommend taking a mag on prices (eg Stuff Magazine) for your gadgets so you can prove the cost etc.Some very cool shops too though that you wont necessarily get elsewhere - stock up on your Manolo Blahniks, Prada, Louis Vuitton, Bathing Ape where you are not going to get it locally, just keep away from market stalls etc who you know will rip you off! Even the locals say you are lucky if a fake watch/clothes last you till you get home but dont expect it to last for much longer - get what you pay for!!For any trips - try to go with Destination Asia and hope you get to meet 'Norman' who is (we are told) a young 78 but should be on stage he is that funny!All in all, an ok experience but Bangkok is a much more welcoming, service friendly place that I would recommend.

<Content>Nice stay at the Kimberley We arrived late evening after long flight from Chicago. The Kimberley was conveniently located to shopping and really gave us a taste of the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong's unique neighborhoods. For the money it was a very nice Hotel and the Food in the restaurants were excellent. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Would come back again.

<Content>Great HK hotel at a keen price - recommended I stayed here on the way back from Oz in Dec 04. Hotel is quite large, but very conveniently placed with good access to the MTR and Nathan Road. Just a short walk down to the TST harbourside for some fantastic night time views across to HK island. Check in staff were not the friendliest but ok, considering the lateness of my check in. Room was clean and serviceable, bed comfy and gave no cause for complaint, i slept well. I advise you not to go anywhere near the Mini bar however, it's very expensive! All in all, a worthy place to stay, i would definitely return there if ever i was passing through HK again, or staying there for a holiday.

<Content>Disappointed We have just returned from Hong Kong on the 1st of September.The Kimberley Hotel while being convenient is not a hotel we would stay in again or recomend it to anyone else. The room that we stayed in was small to say the least. The bed was very hard. A definate lack of a decent mirror. eg. One where you can see all of yourself without having to stand on a chair.They advertise that all rooms have city views. If the back of another building is what the advertisment means a city view. I stand corrected.Lkaczmarek

<Content>Okay hotel in Hong Kong We spent three nights at the Kimberly Hotel in Hong Kong in August /06. We found this hotel just OK. The front staff were not overly friendly but they did there job. The rooms were for the most part a little shabbly. It really needed a new paint job and some TLC. The bathroom I think had been redone as it was clean and somewhat modern. Overall the room was small. The good thing about this hotel is it is in a good location, pretty much close to anything you would need. There is an airport bus stop just up the road. This was the most economical way of getting to the airport that we found. The view from the double decker bus was awesome. Hope this helps!

<Content>Loved it!!! I stayed at the Kimberly in a triple share room with my two sisters and had a wonderful time at the Kimberly. The rooms were clean, no funny smells and fantastic value for money. The staff were fantastic, even though at the beggining we forgot we're supposed to tip in HK (i.e. bellboys). I would recommend it to anyone, the location was fantastic, walking distance from night market (15-20 min leisure stroll) and from the ferry as well. I will go back when i visit HK again.

<Content>Pleasant Hotel Very helpful staff, lovely lobby and restaurants. Breakfast buffet is outstanding. Rooms are not large, but similar to European standards and are very clean. Maid service was efficient and thorough. Location is very good; close to Nathan Road and not far from the Jade Market, the Peninsula, the ferry, HK Museum. Walking in HK is a delight...the city is spotless. Be sure to go the HK side and take the outdoor escalator up the mountain. Victoria's Peak was a slight disappointment, although the view is beautiful.

<Content>Great Location but shoe box size room! Great Location and withing walking distance to Nathan Rd, Star Ferry and the MTR. Lots of shops and restaurants surrounding the hotel which were fantastic. Can not fault the location at all.However the standard room I booked for my small daughter and I was like a shoe box and I was quite shocked. By looking at the photo's I should have requested or paid for a better room which appear to be larger. I had two single beds in my room and my daughters was pushed up hard against the wall. Mine was very close to the little chair and table in the room. There was practically no space to move/walk.We could only stand our bags against the wall and when we needed something out of them, we had to put them on the beds to open them. There was no room to open them on the floor.But the worst was the beds. They were as hard as wooden benches and I was shocked when I lay down how hard and rigid they were. I've stayed in other Kowloon hotels and have never had that before. But in the hotel directory it stated you could ring room service and they could supply extra mattresses for you and fit them. Which was funny. As housekeeping arrived, we had to leave the room and they could barely move to do it with our bags etc and the size of the room. The woman wasn't too happy doing it but by the way they answered the phone when I rang, I am pretty sure most people request them.The Chinese restaurant downstairs is good, although very quiet. Prices are more expensive than what you can find outside the hotel. But we were very happy with the meal. Hotel staff at reception were friendly.Basically if you are after a budget hotel and don't plan to spend much time in the hotel due to sightseeing etc, then this is a good choice. It is a reasonable price in a great location.Personally I wouldn't stay there again as I simply found the rooms to be so small.

<Content>Great Location The best thing about this hotel was the location. There were lots of good eating places around (not to mention KFC and Maccas - although Hong Kong Style) and easy access to transport. It is in the middle of a shopping district so it's very busy and can be quite noisy. Careful of the seedy salesmen waiting for you to step out of the hotel to try and flog you copy watch and copy handbag. Just walk by without looking at them or talking to them! The rooms are EXTREMELY small but very clean and very comfortable. We found the bathroom quite big and there was bath salts, dressing gowns, slippers etc. etc. etc! The staff at reception and the concierge weren't overly friendly but overall we were very happy with out stay there

<Content>Good Value, Nice Hotel We stayed (2 adults) in the Kimberley Hotel for 3 nights. We feel that it's a nice hotel and great value. It's definitely a 4-star hotel. The breakfast was nice and included a large variety of hot and cold items. Like others mentioned, the downside is that smoking is allowed in the dining room. The rooms were nicely decorated, the bed was okay, a little on the hard side but okay.The staff was very gracious and always helpful. The location is great as it is in close proximity to Nathan Rd. and close to lots of great shopping spots and many restaurants. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Have Stayed Here Twice The best thing about this hotel is its location close to MTR on Nathan Road, about 10-15 walk to Star Ferry and about 10 min walk to Temple Street Night Market, rooms are small but are clean, staff are not as friendly as they could be, prices seem to have gone up recently and in our opinion this hotel is now not such good value for money as it used to be. Food in the restuarant was good but take a jacket as the air con is always on full and it is very cold.

<Content>Good Value Spent 7 days at the Kimberly and found it to be very pleasant, clean and convenient. Close to Nathan Rd and MTR (about 5 mins walk). About a 15 minute walk to Habour City (huge shopping malls)on Canton Rd. Taxis are cheap to get back if you find yourself with loads of shopping! The bed was a little hard - however they supply a foam underlay if you request it. Shower was great and bathroom supplies are plentiful. The breakfast buffet was lovely - so much to choose from - unfortunately smoking is allowed which does take away from the experience! It exceeded my expectations particularly at the price. We also stayed at Marco Polo Hong Kong for the following 17 days and although it is in a much better position the actual hotel was disappointing (see my review). Be careful of shops which do not show prices - they tend to jack them up quite a bit for the unsuspecting tourist. Make sure you know the usual retail price before beginning bargaining. Be wary of brands you have not heard of.

<Content>Great, central hotel Stayed here for 4 nights mid January. There were 2 adults and 1 child and we were on 20th floor. Very quiet and not long wait for lifts. We had 1 bedroom and lounge with sofa bed for child. Not overly roomy but we did not need much more. Bathroom clean. Breakfast was good, we filled up for the day. Down side was the smoking in the breakfast room. As a non-smoker it was quite unpleasant, even tho there are seperate areas the air is all the same. Check in and out reasonable. Walking distances no problem and close to MRT station. Would stay there again.

<Content>Terrific, modest hotel in Tsim Tsa Shui In the center of the shopping area on Kowloon- extremely quiet, comfortable double beds provided. Tea and coffee in room. Rooms quite small by U.S. standards. Take train from airport to the hotel shuttle. Take shuttle #5 which drops off across street from hotel Very convenient and much less expensive than taxi. Check in/out efficient.
