<Content>Fantastic stay in a wonderful hotel My husband and I stayed in the MeMadrid hotel from 11th to 15th November 2008 for a preChristmas City Break. We had booked a supreme room on Expedia and joined the Mas Reward scheme beforehand. I emailed the hotel before our break and requested a non-smoking king bed room overlooking Plaza Santa Ana. The room we were allocated was simply superb and had a fantastic view of the Plaza. The bed was very comfortable and the techy equipment and lighting was great fun. The shower room was equally superb with a fantastic shower. The reception desk and concierge were at all times very friendly and helpful. The bar staff, both in the ground floor bar and the rooftop bar were at all times really friendly and good at their jobs. We had absolutly no problems with noise even though our room overlooked the plaza - we slept exceptionally well and heard no noise from the plaza or the rooftop bar. The windows in our room had the original windows overlaid with excellent double glazing windows. The location of this hotel is excellent. On our previous trip to Madrid we had stayed at one of the big hotels on Gran Via but would now always stay in this location. We ate in the restaurant for one breakfast and the food was excellent. The other mornings we ate at a local cafe - we were too full from all the tapas we ate in the evening to justify eating a large breakfast. again. The hotel is walking distance to the 3 great art museums in Madrid and the only time we used the metro was to go to Real Madrid football ground to do the stadium tour. I guess you get what you pay for - if you choose the cheapest rate you will get the smallest room, if you choose a mid rate you will get an excellent room with a great view. By joining the Mas Reward programme we were able to receive two English newspapers for free every morning and to have the buffet breakfast in the restaurant for half price - how great is that. I have recommended this hotel to many friends since our return - if you want to stay in a great hotel in a fantastic location in a fun city like Madrid, this is the place for you.

<Content>Nice hotel, nice small room Early 2000 I spent one night in this hotel .At that time the name was Reina Victoria and hotel building  facilities were nice however Plaza Santa Ana is a nicer place so we have decided to spent one night on our way back from Andalusia to home. The interior design is renovated and reception area is equipped with nice staff and music. The room was small however quite nice and decorated with wonderful lighting system with high tech bedside control panel. Our accommodation was without breakfast so no explanation about this. Front desk staff was perfect, they supplied free maps and also some umbrella to other visitor. We would recommend this hotel because of it鈥檚 venue as we agree with the members about it鈥檚 wonderful location full of bars and nice restaurant hence quite close to Museums Thyssen and Prado.

<Content>Great Location - Tiny Room! This is a nice hotel in an excellent location. However its not cheap.Its going for the boutique feel which I liked but having spent 2 days here and trying to work in the room it feels a bit like being stuck in a hutch!

<Content>I loved it It was just like I expected it to be. I stayed in the Urban Suite for 3 Days which was just like the picture; they're not too small, decorated simple n clean and the price is great!!!! The concierges couldn't be more helpful n knowledgeable of the city and good places to go.The location couldn't be better, we walked every where and it's a very nice walk.And one of my favorite surprises: All their products are AVEDA!!

<Content>Spanish version of a groovy hotel There must be quite a variation in room size from reading other reviews - I stayed 3 nights in what must have been the smallest double room I've ever been in.The room was well-appointed though in current hi-tech, minimalist hotel-designer style (why must they those push-pull taps! Did they ever test-drive them or just choose for looks!) - wood laminate floors, big flat screen TV, bedside controls for lighting, a/c etc (had a struggle to get the room warm enough).Shower is amazing with massage jets every which way.Best feature for me on a biz trip - FREE WIFI that worked!The hotel almost tries too hard with the cool image - the website looks like they're a bordello, and is close to being guilty of style over substance, but then I'm an old fart!As others have said, great location in a the beautiful Plaza Santa Ana

<Content>Hip, happening and great value We stayed at the ME Madrid in August 2008. The hotel is in a great location, really central and in a pleasant square with a number of tapas bars in.We had booked a standard (i.e. deluxe) room, and found it to be really spacious, with a massive bed, flat screen TV, 2 armchairs, coffee table and well stocked minibar. Loved the lighting options too! We had booked on the ME wants you in Madrid package, which meant that there was a bottle of cava with strawberries and dipping chocolate in our room. The bathroom was also huge with a fantastic double shower. Contrary to some of the other reviews, we didn't have a problem with noise at all (We had an internal room with no view but probably the best bet if you prefer quiet at night).Tip - try to get a package which includes breakfast as it is otherwise quite expensive. There are a number of packages available on the hotel's own website and I found these to be similarly priced to supposed discount websites.The restaurant and downstairs bar are fantastic, very hip and trendy but certainly no attitude, and the service was very good.The upstairs bar is great for views (although very windy!), the only frustrating point was that despite going up there early (9pm), all seats were reserved - which doesn't make sense given that there wasn't a queue at that point to sit on them - I think the hotel needs to manage this better.Altogether though, I couldn't recommend the hotel highly enough, it's reasonable value and a stylish place to spend the weekend.

<Content>Comfortable, modern and funky! My husband and I stayed at the ME Melia for 3 nights last week and enjoyed our stay. To minimise on cost, we took a Deluxe room (which despite the posh sounding name is a standard room!). It was very small, but as we weren't planning on spending that much time in the room and it was a short stay, we didn't mind. If we had been there for a week then we definitely would have chosen a larger Supreme room. Our room was clean, cosy and comfortable though.All we could see from our window was a white wall outside, but we weren't too fussed about that. The DVD player was a very nice touch, as TV channels in hotels can often be quite limiting. When you come back in the evening, there is a nice lips-shaped chocolate on your bed, along with a small candle by the bedside.The bathroom was lovely, and the shower is amazing!! They provide lovely Aveda products and good quality robe and towels. There is plenty of storage space too.I took my own teabags but unfortunately there was not a kettle in the room, I am not sure if the larger rooms would have had one. Although we didn't ask them much, the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. This is definitely a hotel for the younger crowd as the staff are all young and hip, and often wearing designer clothing.The location of the hotel is excellent, Plaza de Santa Ana is where there are a lot of cafes and bars for the evening, and it is within walking distance of the main shopping area (Sol/Gran Via). We even walked to the museums, although it took about 20-30 mins, but we wanted the exercise.We popped up to the rooftop bar to have a look, and it looked really nice but was closed when we went (monday evening) but on a weekend it is supposed to be excellent. The whole hotel has a nice modern funky feel to it.Although this is a hotel review, I will say a few other things about my trip in general!If you have a sweet tooth, you must have some chocolate y churros (long donuts with very thick hot chocolate) from Chocolateria San Gines, they are to die for! we had it about 5 times in 3 days, so you can imagine how much we loved them! Also just opposite it is a nice italian place with excellent quality pizza, but I forget the name. We also went to a chain called Ginos but the pizza there was awful! A friend recommended Siam which is a Thai restaurant on Calle San Bernadino near Plaza de Espana which was really nice, and although was hidden away, seemed to be popular and full of people. Somehow I didn't manage to find a good place for tapas, but am sure there are plenty of places, probably in side streets. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed my trip, and would definitely consider staying at the ME again.

<Content>Only suitable for party people Do not stay here if you want to get a good night's sleep. We stayed for 2 nights. It is party central with booming dance music coming from the rooftop bar and lasting until 3.30 in the morning. There is also loud music from the bar on the ground floor. We tried to change rooms but nowhere was quiet. I would emphasise that it was noise from inside the hotel, not from outside that was a problem. It obviously caters for party people and the staff will politely apologise for the noise but do nothing about it. The hotel would obviously rather have the extra revenue from club-goers than give other guests a chance to sleep. The hotel is hip and looks good, the staff are generally helpful and the rooms are comfortable enough if rather small. However these positive aspects are irrelevant as you cannot get a good night's sleep here and that's what most people want from a hotel.

<Content>Awful and patheti service At the terrace, After paying an expensive and tasteless mojito, me and 9 friends sat at a sofa table, with permission of the waiter. But after a while, he comes with a group of HIS friends arguing the table was reserved and that they didn麓t have the reservation card on because of the rain (???) and made us stand up and leave.IT IS NOT A PROPER WAY TO TREAT A CLIENT, YOU CANNOT MAKE A CLIENT LEAVE THE TABLE TO SIT ANOTHER CLIENT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. We told the manager, his answer was a sorry for the mistake. YOU CAN NOT EXPECT A GOOD SERVICE FROM THIS HOTEL...even the manager doesn麓t care as he should.

<Content>Smallest room on earth I've traveled quite a bit through Europe and have stayed in some small hotel rooms, but this one takes the cake. The hotel is funky and cool, but the rooftop bar is loud. The rooms are nicely fitted out and its in a good location (Plaza de Santa Ana), but I can't get past the size of the room.

<Content>Muy bien!!!! Great Stay!!!! Great room they assigned me. Service was good and the hotel is very well located. Yes, perhaps a bit noisy outside but it is lively and fun. Breakfast is outraggeously expensive but good. If you fancy comtemporary and modern, this is the place.

<Content>Party House I stayed here for business. The building is very hip, and the people who work there are also hip and young, many with an attitude. The hotel is very noisy, both from the party-goers who frequent the hotel, as well as from the street. The worst thing of all is the noise coming from the roof-top bar. It is a really neat venue, and is extremely popular with young people going out. But it does not mix well with the concept of a hotel, i.e. supposedly offering people a place to SLEEP. But the facilities were modern, relatively clean. The stairwell was dignified and nice. The restaurant had good feng shui, but the breakfast was nothing special. I would only recommend the hotel to hip party-go'ers who want to be in this part of town which is touristy and not very pleasant.

<Content>Not a good experience I stayed here Sept 4 through 6 2008. I am NOT a picky traveler and the most important thing for me is to be able to sleep at night. All else I can forego. Well, I had specifically asked for a quiet room. I got a room facing the courtyard but the bar on the roof of the hotel played LOUD music unit 3:45 in the morning!!! The windows are not double-paned which I find absolutely ridiculous for this hotel seeing how their DJ blasts music till practically morning. We stayed a Thursday and Friday, both nights the music was loud but especially Friday night. We had an early flight on Saturday morning so we slept around 3 hours even though we went to bed at 11 at night. I was very upset but still so professional towards the receptionist. She at first was not believing me and kept saying are you sure it was not the bars outside. I was like YES I AM SURE!!!!! Her name was Sabrina. I told her I wanted to see the manager, she said he wasn't there. I told her I did not think I should pay 150 euros for the previous night as I had not slept. She said she'd talk to him and either contact me by phone or email. Needless to say neither has happened and my card was charged for both nights. We got a complimentary breakfast and that was it. The rest of the hotel is OK. The rooftop bar looks very cool but the noise is just insane. Location is very good. I am willing to bet there are a ton better hotels though. I would skip this one because I am not a light sleeper and it was too much even for me.

<Content>We just loved it We spend 5 nights at ME MAdrid with our Kids ages 9 and 13. We got two connected rooms and they were small but that is what we expected. They were however very comfortable. Great lighting and AC was perfect. We chose to have interior rooms to avoid the noise and the fact that they faced and inside cortyard did not bodered us at all. If you want a bigger room then just pay for it.We signed up to become Melia members and got breakfast for all 4 for 44 Euros instead of 88 every day.The staff was great! Thank you Ivan and Celia. They guided us very well during our stay.The location of this hotel is fantastic. You can walk to the museums, to Plaza Mayor, Palacio Real, Calle Serrano... everywhere. The location is also fun, Plaza Santa Ana is busy and charming.Celia recommended El Lacon for Tapas and it was great, also went to Huevos de Lucio and loved the huevos con patatas. One night the kids stayed in the hotel and we enjoyed an incredible meal at Ramses in Plaza de Alcala! to our surprise we sat next to Pedro Almodobar... Ramses also has a great bar and dancing area, but be aware that the dancing doesn't start til 2:00am. Make reservations in advanced.DO NOT EAT AT ANY OF THE RESTAURANT INSIDE PLAZA MAYOR. Our only bad experience in Madrid was a dinner at one of the places in there, the food was terrible and very expensive. Later we commented our experience with the concierge at ME Madrid and they never recommend it there. The restaurants at the side streets are much better.We did two day trips to Toledo and to Segovia and Avila and they were both incredible. We wished we had stayed a cople of extra days to fully enjoy Me and Madrid!

<Content>Disappointing, My strong recommendation for this establishment is DO NOT CONTEMPLATE STAYING HERE. Madrid鈥檚 beautiful and enchanting with numerous alternative hotels which hopefully won鈥檛 prove to be such a disappointment.The roof top terrrace may well be as good as others have suggested but it was unavailable when we stayed, as it was booked for private functions and residents cant even get access for a few pictures. A complaint was dealt with several weeks later with the offer of a free drink in response to the thorough runiation of a birthday treat and a bill close to 鈧?,000.Staff clearly dont care, the roof top manager was bloody rude to my wife, clearly Basil Fawlty is alive and well, though now living in Spain!

<Content>Superb! We have just returned from our stay at this fantastic hotel and have to say we were very impressed. The overall feel of the hotel is very chic and funky. The rooms are great with different mood lighting and a great shower. The best feature would have to be the roof garden which is equipt with cozy sofas with hugepillows and candlelit lighting, however these were always reserved eveyn though we never saw anyone using them! The music was great and there was also a musician playing the saxaphone! One the first night we eat at the hotel restaurant where we had a fillet steak, the best we have ever tasted, would highly recommend.The only thing to be aware of is the cost of drinks, we spent an absolute fortune in the bars, on average a spirit and mixer will set you back around 10 euros!!

<Content>decadence (probably) On two occasions I have been lucky enough to stay at this hotel...but on each the crazy Madrid pace meant i didn't spend enough time in this amazing place to really benefit.I stayed on the fourth floor (406?) which overlooks Placa Sant Ana. It has a great sound system, TV, really comfortable bed and lighting control system. It'd be a GREAT place for a weekend, unfortunately I will have to keep trying my luck to get back there on a Friday.very modern, coooooool and tredy. Apparently the roof terrace bar (not a rare occurrence in Madrid) has a queue at weekends to be seen

<Content>Great rooftop bar and good hotel My fiance and I love sending time in Madrid, and although disappointed not to get into our previous hotel, we were very pleasantly surprised to find a deal with the ME which we had seen on a previous trip.Without a shadow of a doubt, the best feature of this hotel is the wonderful rooftop bar. Occupied with what appears to be the beautiful people of Madrid, the drinks were well priced and very tasty. It is however the setting that is the bars biggest selling point. Even if you don't stay here - go. Book a private lounge bed if you can (bottle service only).As with all places, your experience will depend on the room that you book. Ours was facing onto an internal lightwell, and so wasn't as bright as one would hope. In spite of this, the room was comfortable, with a great audio visual set up. The mood lighting was very special. The only thing that was frustrating about the room was that the bathroom door was prone to slide open if you weren't careful.One final tip, join with the ME hotel group frequent user programme to get a free breakfast for one of your party (based on two people). The breakfast is worth getting up for, although expensive, so eat up!

<Content>Excellent hotel, excellent location, excellent experience! I booked this hotel based on its location and its modern design, I was not disappointed on either front. I took my girlfriend for a weekend break in Madrid and the hotel really made our trip. The hotel oozes style from the second you enter the reception, the rooms are very impressive in design and decor. The room had some very nice touches the 32 LCD tv built into the wall, the dvd/Bose sound system and the mood light settings were excellent.The bar on the ground floor is excellent and very popular as it is regarded as one of the coolest hang outs in the area to socialise and be seen. To be honest this bar is only out done on that front by the hotels rooftop bar called Penthouse. There is always a que outside the hotel for this bar but guest can use the internal lift which takes you directly into the bar on the 7th floor, you get a fantastic view from up there.The location is excellent it faces a beautiful square with fantastic cafe's and tapas bars and most sights are within walking distance and those that aren't the metro system is just a couple of hundred yards walk.We will return to Madrid and will be staying at this hotel! Highly recommended A+.

<Content>Fantastic...but, not perfect. The hotel is in a fantastic location. Extremely central to old Madrid and ideal to explore the city.Very contemporary and highly chic, the hotel has a very modern designer fell throughout and will not let you down if that's your bag.The room was very clean and the bed huge. The space around the bed was limited although the built-in 32 flat screen tv and lighting control panel made up for this. The bathroom was wonderful and although lacking a bath the powershower had hydro massage built-in and really does give a fantastic shower.On arrival the reception staff were friendly, warm and efficient. The man that dealt with us really was great as was the original concierege (Chemo) who was so friendly and nothing seemed to much for him.The paradox was that the front desk staff seemed to be largely highly efficient unlike some (not all!) of the staff in The Penthouse (rooftop bar). On the Sunday the bar was closed due to rain. We had got a bottle of wine and had one of the beds, which are canvas enclosed spaces shielding you from the elements and allowing you to enjoy the views from the bar. The staff said we had to vacate the bed and go inside because they needed to store things in the space. Ok, I understand that they need to protect the furnishings, but when we were asked to go inside there was no room at all to sit. We decided to go to our room with the wine and they said that this was fine but we couldn't take the ice bucket with us! This meant that we would to have had to get room service to bring a new bucket at a charge.The next day The Penthouse was meant to be closed and we found that it was in fact open. We decided to have a drink or two and found that the barman couldn't even muster a smile or even a hint of warmth despite attempting to engage him. This is sad as it lets down the other staff who seem to work so hard to give a genuine sense of warmth.The strange thing is that you are limited as to where you can sit on The Rooftop as alot of prime seating areas are cordoned off for bottle service only. This means that to sit in these areas you have to purchase a bottle off the menu. With the cheapest bottle at 150 euros and being spirits, it makes sitting anywhere truly nice unfeasible if there is just two of you and you don't want to die from alcohol poisoning. As residents it would be nice if they reviewed this and at quieter times open up the prime seating to at least residents. I do understand this policy at busy times but the bar was nearly empty!The final day was marred by a pushy maid who at 09:30 knocked our door to see if she could clean it! Check-out time is at 12:00! She then knocked again at 11:30 and someone else came in to check the mini-bar in between those times. I'm sure it's not the case, but the maid made us feel as if she wanted us out early so she could get her work out the way!Some lovely treats were left in the rooms from the aura experience management and the food in Midnight Rose is great.On Madrid, please don't bother going if you're a vegetarian (my partner is!) and if you like Tea, bring some with you!

<Content>Stylish hotel in good location Stayed here for one night for business in a Supreme room. The room was well sized, clean and the bed was comfortable. The Aveda products in the bath room was also a nice touch. The turn down service in the evenings with mood lighting was also very inviting.However, there were some skuff marks and the room was starting to show its age since wood floors etc. generally will wear and tear with age.I would recommend this hotel if you can get a good rate. The roof top bar is very nice and recommended in the evenings when enjoying warm weather. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Great hotel in the centre of the old city I stayed 3 nights with a friend this past April. It was my second trip to Spain but the first to Madrid. Its a lovely hotel with a very popular bar / restaurant on the 1st floor and lounge at the top. The location was great on the Plaza Santa de Ana within walking distance to the Prado and the Plaza Mayor. We did upgrade rooms. The initial room was very very small and faced an interior back courtyard. It would have been ok for one person but it was way too tight for 2. The second room was lovely with high ceilings, modern decor, a great large bath (a shower with body spas) and a bar. There are bedside electronic lighting control (one setting was sexy) and just an overall cheekiness to the design. We had a great view of the Plaza. Only downsides were the very high price due to the awful exchange rate and the slow shower draiin (a pet peeve of mine).

<Content>Uber-Cool but Over-Priced I stayed at the ME Melia for two nights on business last month. The public areas are very spanky. However, beware of special events because on one night both the roof terrace and lobby bar were closed for private promotions (some cigar launch I think).I guess my conference rate meant the smallest rooms. Very pleasant and comfortable but no room to swing the proverbial cat. But even that was over E250 a night.Personally I prefer the Urban, which is similarly priced but a little more spacious (at least the rooms I have stayed in). However, Santa Ana is buzzing so the Melia's location comes out on top.

<Content>The best stay ever Let's start with the beginning...A great location! in the middle of the city but not on a busy street so no traffic noise!As soon I we arrived they upgraded us. The room was amazing, bright, the decor is as seen on the website... very modern and chic. The bathroom was also very nice and modern. This hotel was reopened in 2005 so pretty recent.The concierge service was amazing as well. After asking for a restaurant where to celebrate my husband's birthday, we found a cake and note in the room when we came back!Even if you don't stay at the hotel, you need to check out the lounge they have upstairs (view of Madrid) as well as the spa next door. The best retreat ever!! Very romantic!We will definitely go back. It seems that every detail were perfect.Also, they have plasma TV and free internet access.The chic, modern and young in Madrid.... you got it.

<Content>Ignore the pessimists.... hotel is fantastic After reading some 'mixed' reviews, I was slightly cautious as to what I might find when we arrived at the hotel....However, it was fantastic. Tired? Not in the slightest. The hotel is decorated in a very modern and chic fashion. The rooms aren't large - but if you want bigger, upgrade to a bigger room. They are MORE than sufficient. The beds are so comfy and the bedding 1st class. The bathrooms are luxurious and the complimentary Aveda products were a dream....Furthermore, the reception staff were very polite and so helpful. For my partners birthday they arranged for a cake to be delivered to our room - with their compliments - and as a surprise. Aloof? Not that we came across. They are effiicient and curteous.All in all the stay was first class. The bar and the restuarant is verging on the pricey side but the atmosphere is good. It is where the beautiful people go and if you like people watching stay here to join them.....If you need a central location, where the sights and bars of Madrid are in walking distance, then this is the hotel for you....

<Content>Stylish and well located Four of us stayed here over New Year in two rooms The hotel is in a great location for restaurants, tapas bars and cafes as it is at one end of the very lively Plaza Santa Ana. It is easy to walk to all the main tourist attractions from here as well.We were pleasantly impressed by the friendly and helpful staff at reception and in general found the service at this hotel to be good. Our rooms faced the internal courtyard which meant they were quiet, even on New Year's Eve. The rooms are small, although not exceptionally so for a European hotel, but are well appointed and quite stylish. There are flat screen tvs, good quality linen and bathroom accessories, quality magazines and easy internet access. The room lighting offers a sophisticated array of options - from 'sexy' purple through to good, strong reading lights. There is a small but well equipped gym.The restaurant on the ground floor offers a good buffet breakfast. We ate in the restaurant on New Year's Eve when it was a fixed menu - expensive but great fun and elegantly done.I would definitely consider staying here again, largely because if its location.

<Content>Great stay Lovely hotel in a great location, staff friendly and professional.We had a supreme room overlooking Plaza Santa Ana which was great, spacious and really comfortable bed! Standard rooms looked to be very small.Bar and restaurant really good. Modern and trendy if a bit pricey.Would definitely reccommend to couples or a group of friends away for a short break.

<Content>Super-stylish, amazing location, ultra-modern The ME is a fabulously stylish hotel for people who love design and style. There's a certain pretentious air to it, but it's firmly tongue-in-cheek. If you get a room overlooking the Plaza Santa Ana the views are truly wonderful. The rooms are great - enormous beds, great TV screen and sound system with huge music menu, world-class showers (but small bathrooms) and very sophisticated mood lighting in the rooms. The only downside about this is that the switches are completely unintuitive and it takes a while to figure out what buttons to press (if they are buttons at all...) in order to get the lighting scheme you want. But it's all very fun, sexy and funky. Breakfast is very good and high quality. It's a good experience, but perhaps too expensive because at the end of the day, it's a bit gimmicky and shouldn't be taken too seriously.

<Content>Awesome Me We have just got back from a four night stay in the fantastic Me reina Victoria. On arrival we were up graded to a supreme room overlooking the lovely Santa Ana square with strawberries,chocalate and a bottle of cava to celebrate our anniversary and really everything just got better and better, the room was beautiful brilliant shower, Flat screen tv with a 5.1 sound system fab lighting great little touches like the speaker in the bathroom, turn down service with your little chocalate lip sweets. The staff could'nt have been more pleasant or helpful, the lobby is fantastic as are all the bars.But the best thing was location location location,Santa Ana really is the nicest part of madrid, you have 3 great jazz bars on your door step Cafe Central, Cafe jazz and populart which were all great in fact all the bars in the area are brilliant we especially liked Viva madrid and Olsen on C/prado 15 this is also a restaurant and has a really unusual menu, high recommended, we also loved La creazione on Ventura de la vega 9 and best of all if you like Indian food the brilliant Anapurna on Calle Zurbano 5 one of the nicest Indians we have ever been to. For sightseeing the prado was fantastic its massive you could easily spend a full day there, also the reina sofia is smaller but also worth visiting and the royal palace is breath taking, Madrid is a beautiful city and I could not recommend the Me and its location any higher

<Content>Hotel - Yes.....Madrid - No! Modern, trendy hotel in a great location to explore the city. We spent New Year's Eve in the Penthouse Bar which has fantastic views over the city..... great music and a great atmosphere and a great crowd! There was a meal on offer but we chose not to bother with this as we arrived quite late. This was after venturing to the Puerta Del Sol and deciding it may not be too clever an idea to stay there! Bit rough!! The hotel staff were welcoming and friendly, very young and very hip ! Special mention to the concierges who provide an excellent helpful service. The rooms are on the small side but i would agree with an earlier review that the bed is nothing short of fantastic. Altho' small the rooms are modern, clean and have all the technology one might need. The bathroom was again modern and well appointed, especially the shower which was fab! All in all the room was most acceptable for the price we paid...which was not the hotel's own website price! Breakfast was the usual; fresh fruit, all types of eggs, bacon, cereal, toast. Pricey at 20.50 euros tho. Service here and in the bar was very good. Security was good also in that the elevators would only operate with the insertion of your room card. Check in and check out were painless even with the added nusiance of the hotel having a booking in our name for two double rooms instead of the three we booked with the website. There was absolutely no fuss made or questions asked and it was dealt with in seconds. Location was excellent, walking distance to Puerta del sol, Gran Via, Prado museum etc....be warned the queues we saw for this on the 2nd January were horrendous!! This was just after 9.00a.m! Plaza Santa Ana is a lovely little square with craft stalls and plenty going on. Altho we would thoroughly recommend the hotel we would not return to Madrid (unless for the hotel's New Year Party!) Not a patch on Barcelona or even Valencia....unfriendly, not too clean, not that much to see and do apart from the museums and shops. We look forward to trying another ME hotel after this experience.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel, great location My partner and I stayed here two nights after getting a very good deal over Lastminute, as such we only had an entry level room (internal view) but it was more than adequate.The hotel is great. Firstly, it's easily found from the airport via the metro. Once at the hotel I was very impressed by the fit and finish of the rooms, plasma screen, surround sound system and the bed is one of the best I have slept in. The shower is also an event in itself with more nozzles than I knew what to do with. It's very modern and has a boutique feel. The aveda toiletries were a bonus as well.I have no qualms recommending this hotel to anyone visiting Madrid.

<Content>Do Not Bother! Waste Of Money! As cool as the ME looks, it is not worth 1 euro....considering how expensive it is, the staff were cold, arrogant and rude. I have dealt with my share of pretentious individuals at hotels, restaurants, clubs and bars and the staff here rank as some of the worst.The receptionists were stand-offish and the concierge was worse than bouncers at trendy NYC Meatpacking clubs...DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! In the immediate vicinity you can find the Westin Palace, Villa Real, Urban and Ritz Carlton - all friendly and much more deserving of your business.

<Content>Exceptional hotel experience!! We stayed at the ME for 4 days and I could not be happier with my choice!!First of all, the location was great, we walked to all the museums, Palacio Real, Plaza Mayor, etc. Its about a 5-10 minute walk anywhere you want to go in the city (with the exception of serrano st shopping which has is a short cab ride). Also, its right around the corner from Puerto Sol which is the hub of the city. Plaza Santa Ana, where the hotel is located, is where all the tapas bars/nightlife is and it seemed that there was always something going on day or night. A great place to people watch.The hotel itself was immaculate, very stylish and modern, and we loved coming back to our room after a long day of sight seeing. We had a deluxe inside room which was smaller than other hotels we have stayed in but the room was very well laid out, had one of the most comfortable beds we have slept in and a GREAT shower. The atmosphere of the hotel is very young, urban, sophisticated, and sexy, and the crowd the same. This really is one of in spots in Madrid. The restaurants and bars had great atmosphere, including the rooftop penthouse which had a great view and great crowd. Finally, I want to comment about service and say that it was ABSOLUTELY EXCEPTIONAL. Room Service, maid service, and wait staff were top notch, but we the level of attention of and service we received from the Concierge at the ME was really in a class of its own. We received great suggestions on restaurants, bars, shopping, etc. but one night, Lucas from the concierge staff helped turn a bad situation we experienced into a great one (of course one that neither he nor the hotel controlled). He went out of his way to help us, i have never had a concierge or hotel provide that level of service for myself or for anyone that I have ever know. We even got a hand written note from Lucas that night hoping that everything went well. I felt like one of the celebrities who was also staying at the hotel! This is my third visit to a ME hotel, and I can't wait until they open others.

<Content>ME Hotel Madrid - Don't bother ! No atmosphere, and cold staff! It's about as wecoming as an art museum! I have just come back from this hotel after spending a long weekend there with my husband. Overall I found the place extemely cold and impersonal. It has all of the trappings of a luxury hotel, but the staff act like they are the guests of the hotel and that you are very lucky to be there ! I never felt welcomed. I really felt like they have an attitude that you must have a certain look to stay in 'their' hotel. At times felt that if I was not wearing what they perceive to be designer clothes I was being judged poorly by the snooty sfaff ! My attitude was that I'm on holidays and not at work!As a small example, when I asked for a reccommendation for a restauranct at the main desk I needed to confirm my room number and my name before they would actually even give me assistance. I mean it, no mistakes ! When I got my room number wrong the first day I had to correct the number before they would help. This was the case each time I asked for help; name and room number first. I wonder what they would have done if I wasn't staying in the hotel and asked for help... ? I don't want to go into a list examples but suffice it to say this was an attitude that the staff in their designer armani clothes had for the entire weekend. It takes more than cool surrounds to make a hotel. I paid for a luxury hotel, with warm helpful staff but I didn't get what I expected ! Will go with the Urbana next time.

<Content>WOW!!!!!! Amazing experience! WOW. This hotel was a suprise for my partner for Valentines and wow it was amazing! The staff greated us in the reception area all wearing matching Armani Jeans and Jumpers which made us feel very chic. The hallways and corridors had up to date music playing in them and futuristic lighting. The room was quite small but had everything you needed in there, We were shocked at the surround sound flat screen tv and stereo! They had a great range of films and cds to hire in th room. There was a great range of room service available.The restaurant and bar looked great and again very modern.Location wise the hotel was very close to all the shops and tourist attractions.Brilliant hotel!The bathroom was all modern with a brill power shower.

<Content>ME Madrid Reina Victoria - Flawless 5 Star Experience I just had a 3 night stay in the ME Madrid Reina Victoria hotel. It was great. I'm posting an objective review of the hotel below.My girlfriend had never been to Europe before so for my birthday I decided to treat the both of us to a trip through Europe. I wanted everything to be perfect. I booked each part of my trip myself since I have traveled to Europe many, many times. I was just in Spain a few months ago and I had drinks on top of the outdoor terrace at the hotel and I was really impressed by the hotel and location so I booked it.It was a GREAT experience that was truly flawless. There are 191 hotel rooms here from $350 (with tax) all the way up to $2,000 a night rooms. We stayed in a nice suite that was about $500 a night with taxes and it was great. The room was spacious, the bathroom very high end with marble throughout and the room had a big LCD TV with a DVD player (which we didn't use). The lighting system was great with controls on both sides of the bed to control lighting for the entire room. The mini-bar selection was very good. Also, there was free hi-speed wireless internet and internet with a cord and it was very fast and FREE. I was impressed as we had arrived from Buenos Aires earlier than our check-in and they had everything ready and let us check-in early. Fortunately, we flew first class so we both slept on the plane as there were seats that folded completely flat into beds so we were both ready to explore. Right away the concierge called up and asked me if I needed anything and to let me know that she would be available for anything I needed. Then the manager of the hotel called as well. I'm not sure if this is normal but it was great. Then shortly after their call, they had a nice card welcoming me and they also included both of their business cards as well and let me know if I needed anything they would be available. I thought that was a very nice touch and I was impressed.I'm in the hospitality business and I'm also a real estate developer. I could notice they spent a lot of money on the finish out of the room and they used very good items. The bed was VERY comfortable, the pillows were excellent and the room had black out blinds so we could sleep in. Also, something which was nice was they put sound-proof windows on the windows. I read a review of someone that said it was loud but I can assure you that the room was totally quiet and we didn't hear a thing. The location is PERFECT right in front of Plaza Santa Ana and it's in Central Madrid close to all the museums and not far from all the shopping on Serrano Street. There is a metro station very close as well (Banco de Espana). We ate dinner one night in the restaurant and it was great. We also drank drinks on the terrace and it's a really cool place. The staff was great and always went out of the way for us. I highly recommend this hotel. We had a great experience here. I booked directly with the hotel on their website and it was very quick and easy. I thought the value for the money was extremely good.

<Content>Enjoyed the ME despite a few issues We are just back from a five night stay at the hotel. Overall our experience was good but there were a number of issues. On the positive front the location of the hotel is excellent , with plenty of restaurants , bars and shops in the immediate locality. The musems are also within 10 minutes walk of the hotel and are worth a visit.The concierge service was excellent and extemely helpful. Rooms were generous and modern and could not be faulted. We upgraded to a supreme room so the extra space was good however it did not have a bath. We had a room overlooking the square and was assured it was sound proof, it definitely was`nt and on the Sat night we were kept awake most of the night by local revellers who stopped the racket at 7.30 am Sunday morning.The check in at reception took longer than any other hotel that i have stayed in , and we were first in line. Our key card for the room did not work and after the fifth replacement the male receptionist of which there were two , both of whom had serious attitude problems , got his manager to check the door mechanism, he was helpful and courteous and the door mechanism was re configured next morning, however the key card only worked occasionally in the lift.Breakfast was good by Spanish standards , however very busy on Sat and Sun mornings with many guests having arguments with staff as the buffet was not being replenished quickly enough and staff levels were definitely under resourced.Bar is good and the roof top bar is excellent with spectacular views of the city and a must visit.There is also an independent spa adjoining the hotel which is very good and good value.Overall we would stay in the hotel again, but we would book an internal room , the positives outweigh the negatives.

<Author>Vacations from Boston
<Content>Nice Modern Hotel, Great Location We just returned from an 8 night stay at the ME Madrid. We had a room overlooking the Plaza de Santa Ana on the 5th floor and had a small balcony as well. The only problem with the rooms overlooking the plaza is the noise into all hours of the night ... we did get use to it but on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights ... the partying goes on all night long! But the view itself and the small balcony were nice to have ... and again we did end up getting use to the noise after the 1st night. Overall, the hotel staff was very helpful and spoke English well. They helped us with dinner reservations, cabs, etc. The area near the hotel provides many choices for restaurants ... we walked each night and tried different types of food each night. There was a very casual pizza place just off the square that a tour guide mentioned to us and we actually had dinner there on two nights for something casual and no reservation needed. At 9 PM the place was near empty but by 915 to 9:30 it was packed both nights we were there. Food was very good and right across the street was an ice cream shop ... so we could grab an ice cream and walk around the area after dinner. The location of the hotel is excellent for all the major sites ... we walked everywhere we wanted to go ... 5 minutes to the Puerto del Sol, less than 10 to the Plaza Mayor ... and the museums and Royal Palace all within walking distanct. We took two day side trips to Segovia and Toledo and used Le Tango (letango.com) for a personal 3 hour tour. We also reserved a 3 hour walking tour of Madrid on our first full day with Le Tango. They had been recommended on this site's forum and we were not disappointed! All the guides were informative, helpful and provided great information to help with other things to do, see after the 3 hours. We also used the Madrid Vision for two days ... it's the Madrid version of the hop on, hop off bus! It was a great way to get around and see different sites or areas.Overall, the hotel was very nice, very modern, comfortable bed and nice ammenities. It is expensive but overall I think worth it. We did have breakfast each morning in the hotel and it provided a good variety of hot and cold foods.

<Content>I would love to own the bed! I stayed for 7 nights. The location at Plaza de Santa Ana was ideal. Everything one needed was a short walk away. There is a laundromat nearby across the plaza and a small grocery store on a street immediately behind the hotel. Previous posts mentioned the proximity to the museums and other attractions. The room was tiny! We were on in interior air shaft room, but we spent so little time in the room with Spain's nightlife that we didn't care about view. The rooftop bar did give us a bit of noise at night, but not too much. The one thing I would suggest as a change would be to get rid of the super-overpriced mini bar in the room. It takes up too much valuable space.The bars and restaurant in the hotel are ridiculous in price, fortunately there are so many surrounding choices that you don't need to use them.Security note. A friend with me had her purse stolen from the lobby of the hotel. Honestly, she wasn't watching it like she should have been, but it was discovered quickly. The staff jumped to action, helped her to contact the police, the credit card companies, and gave the security tape to the police. Then sent a apology card and fruit plate to her room. The bed was like sleeping in heaven! I have never slept so well.

<Content>Nice hotel, great location We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of August/beginning of September. The hotel was beautiful, very clean and modern, and the location was fantastic. The beds and pillows were the most comfortable we have ever encountered while travelling! There were also numerous TV channels in English...not that we went to Madrid to watch TV, but it was nice to be able to watch the news in English and my husband enjoyed being able to watch movies in English while he was waiting for me to get ready to go our for the night. The front desk staff was very friendly and helfpul for the most part, but we did have a leak under the sink in our bathroom and the shower wasn't draining properly. We notified the front desk, but these problems were not resolved during our stay. The breakfast buffet selection was very good, especially by European standards. The views from the rooftop bar were amazing, although part of the bar was closed for a private party the night we went up there. We ordered room service for dinner one night and it was surprisingly good, although a little on the expensive side. We found a discount rate through Travelzoo (145 euros/night) that included breakfast. At this price, the hotel was a great find, but I'm not sure it would have been worth paying their normal rates.

<Content>Rude Staff, Talk About Spanish Hospitality This hotel is centrally located in the Plaza Santa Ana which could be considered the center of the movida in Madrid. Close to everything including great historic (aunthentic) bars and restaurants. Great location to stay.However, the hotel staff of this four-star hotel was the worse I have encountered in Spain. Bars in the neighborhood usually let you stay pretty late and very seldom tell you to leave because is late. This is not the case in lobby bar of the Reina Victoria hotel, where not one but two of the staff members asked us to leave and then they started turning the lights on and off. This is while I was having a quiet conversation with a client. So much for a four-star hotel! I really miss the old Reina Victoria with the old bar Manolete.Do not waste your money here. There are plenty of less expensive places that will treat you better, for example, the Hotel Miau on the same Plaza.

<Content>Wrong place, wrong time, wrong age Super location, very high-tech, slightly overpriced. I remember the surroundings from the late 60麓s/early 70麓s as a student in Madrid.The surroundings (Plaza Santa Ana) haven麓t changed much (except for pricing which nowadays seem to be the same as then, although then Pesetas was the valid currency instead of Euros....). Somewhat sheepishly I found out that I had changed in the 35 - 40 years that have passed.......This is THE place for people in the 25-40 bracket, with money to spend and the stamina to do it and, above all, with the understanding of all the new technology with which the rooms are equipped. As an avid MELIA-fan I will (and have) selected other MELIA/TRYP hotels in Madrid for later stays.Peter the Swede

<Content>Exceeded expectations I have just returned from a great stay at the ME Madrid. It is expensive, true, and the rooms are small, but it is in a fantastic location, the rooms are very well appointed and the service is good. This hotel is in the 'trying to be achingly hip' category, and although I suspect the decor will date quickly, it pretty much succeeds.The location is right on the Plaza Santa Ana, which has all the buzz you expect from downtown Madrid. Despite our room overlooking the square, we were not disturbed by the noise except briefly on Saturday night after Real Madrid had just won a match and were likely to win the league.The room was very comfortable with a huge TV, sound system, DVD player, and electrical points for the UK and US as well as Europe. Bathroom with Aveda shampoo etc. The service was very good - UK newspapers in the morning, a turn-down service in the evening, decent breakfast, friendly staff.We did not eat in the restaurant other than for breakfast as there are hundreds of bars and restaurants within 100m of the hotel. We had a drink in the 'Penthouse' bar which was quite cool and stylish, with good views of Madrid.Definitely worth a visit, but don't expect budget prices.

<Content>Disappointing.... I was disapointed at several things.This hotel has a great location but lots of buts.Firstly, it is hugely overpriced for what you get. I had a deluxe double room on the 6th floor. It was tiny. There was minimal space to walk around the bed. There are no tea/coffee making facilitis in the room. The shower is nice, but no bath and frankly i would have loved a relaxing bath.The hotel has a roof top bar which had a private party while i was there and consequently unavailable to the guests, and the NOISE was just awful.There was no breakfast included in the room tariff, and breakfast was 30 euros per person on the menu card.Concierge was less than helpfull. Before my trip i emailed the hotel to ask if they picked up their guests, i was told yes, BUT not told that this was at an extortionate rate. On the last day, i discovered the charge was 113 euros!!!!!!!!! A taxi on the way back was 38 euros.I would not return, and would recommend staying elsewhere.Conclusion - great location, Overpriced, unhelpful staff.

<Content>Great Hotel I loved this hotel. The rooms were very modern with fantastic bathrooms. Yes they were a little small but i was staying on my own and they had evrything i needed. Are you going to spend your time in Madrid in your room?The location was perfect as the square and roads leading off had many great bars offering something for all tastes. Noise wasnt a problem but i stayed in one of the internal rooms.Everything is possible they say. We checked this and asked for 2 tickets for the Santiago Bernabeau as Reals home game had been brought forward. They duly obliged with two perfect seats for a thrilling 4-3 home win. It cost a few quid but was great.Go stay there.

<Content>ME Madrid Spain The quick synopsis is that the hotel is very, very nice. It is an Santa Ana Plaza, where there is much going on. Certainly in walking to distance to museums. This hotel is very similiar to the W hotels..very style/hip/sexy oriented. If that's what you're looking for, this is it. Free internet in business room. The rooms are e x t r e m e l y small, almost beyond belief but you can't fault the hotel for that. It's just the original building structure. Would vertainly go back!

The hotel is located on the Plaza Santa Ana  is convenient to the museums. The rooms are small but well appointed and spotless. The food in the restaurant for breakfast was buffet and delicious. We would stay there again.

<Content>5 Star, Very Attentive Hotel We left the ME Madrid today, after having wished we could stay longer. This is an amazing hotel. Here's what we thought:THE STAFFThe staff is fantastic. They were extremely attentive to our every need. Dealt with our bags, arranged to have our rental car returned early at a downtown location closer to the hotel (don't try to rent a car and drive in Madrid - you will go crazy). They also helped us with dinner reservations, and even called up to the room the next day to see how dinner went. THE ROOMSThe rooms are beautiful. Other reviewers said they were small, but we didn't find it a problem. The bed is big and comfy and there's pleanty of room for luggage and they have big windows with great views, so I'm not sure what else you can want. Each room has an entertainment system that you can use with your iPod or check out movies to use with the in room DVD player! If you reserve The Level rooms you get an iPod to use during your stay with 1000 songs. Lastly, the bathrooms must be mentioned on their own. They alone are 5 star due to the shower - a rain soaker shower head with 8, yes 8, jets down the front. This plus great water pressure equals a very relaxing time.OUR ROOM TYPEWe reserved The Level, which came with some nice ammenities: 3 shirts ironed upon check in and 1 additional each day - same day service, morning newspaper, car washed upon arrival, etc. Everything but breakfast. LOCATIONThe location was great. We walked most of the main part of the city - from the Royal Palace to the Serrano shopping area and the museums in one day. NEGATIVE?The only negative was the cost of food - very expensive in this hotel and breakfast was not included with our room. They do offer a buffet breakfast in the morning that costs around 20Euro. If you sign up for their hotel membership program you get buy-one-get-one breakfast, so that helps a bit.

<Content>amazing hotel, shame about the noise! This is a wonderful hotel and we got a great deal through expedia. The rooms vary in size in each category so its worth asking at reception if they have anything bigger. The service was brillliant and the hotel is incredibly relaxing. The only down side for me was there is a disco on the roof top bar which starts at 1am and does not finish until 5am. Im not normally one to moan about noise, but this really was ridiculous. Shame, as it was glorious otherwise and a great location. We had one of the inside rooms where the noise seemed to tunnel down so perhaps rooms facing out towards the square are better.

<Content>Great Hotel I went to Madrid with my family in October, 2006. We stayed in Me Hotel Reina Victoria for only one night. It was the 10th time we travel to Madrid and this was the best hotel we ever been. Our room, which was not very big but very comfy, had a very nice view to Plaza Santa Ana; all the personnel were very polite. There are better alternatives near by to the restaurant of the hotel which I think is a bit expensive. The hotel in fact is a bit expensive but I still recommend it. The hotel is very good and we intend to return there in May.

<Content>Great Stay!! I spent New Year's Eve 2006 here with my fiance and her family--we rang in the New Year at the rooftop bar. This hotel was amazing. The staff was excellent, catering to my every need. The service in the lounge and restaurant was above-average (a huge compliment in Europe). The hotel was clean, well-maintained, and had a great feel to it. The room was exactly what was promised, with updated electronics, etc. The bathroom even had an American electrical socket. Most major museums and attractions are within walking distance. The only potential drawback is that the hotel faces a very busy town square that is popular at all hours of the night---great news for some hotel patrons, miserable for others. I would strongly recommend this hotel to my friends. My fiance and family stayed at the Ritz--they all agreed they should have stayed here.

<Content>Not so great for the price we paid ! The location of the hotel is great. You are walking distance from everything in central Madrid. The view on the Plaza Santa Ana is great !The hotel just opened 2 months ago and the staff is too friendly and not so professionnal regarding the standing of the hotel and the price we paid.We were at the Level Rooms, they forgot to bring us the newspaper every morning, the room had technical problem (impossible to switch off the entrance light !), and it's already damaged (the wooden floor is scratched!). No bath tube in the room too !

<Content>ME Madrid was OK! I travel a lot for work - so I feel as if I have a good basis for judging hotels. My boyfriend and I just stayed here in December for a business trip he had, and we thought it was fantastic. The rooms were a little small, but no worse then any New York City room. The staff was super friendly and all spoke English, which was helpful to us Americans. My boyfriend had 2 meals at the hotel and said the food was not great - but when you are in Madrid, there is no reason to be eating in a hotel. There were a ton of great restaurants right in the Plaza de Santa Ana. The hotel did offer a free continental breakfast each morning which was pretty extensive. It could not have been in a better location, we were within walking distance to everything. The beds were comfy, the TV was great (with at least 5 stations in English). For a hotel that has only been open for less then 2 months, I thought it was well put together. Both bars at the hotel were great and pretty happening. The bathroom was fantastic, although no tub if you like to take a bath in hotels. Overall, I was pretty impressed.

<Content>Style over substance We have just returned fron a weekend at this hotel and my impressions are somewhat ambivalent. The hotel was extensively refurbished very recently and has some stunning features including a rooftop bar which attracts a queue even on a rainy night in November. The location is just superb, dominating a small square completely edged by bars, restaurants and a theatre and within easy walking distance of the Prado, Plaza Major and Palacio.Service is excellent, though occasionally over-enthusiastic - you can only take so many welcome calls to your room! However, my overall impression was tinged with disappointment. Our deluxe  room was really small and looking over an inner coutyard. Although it had very hi-tec tv, DVD, internet access etc there was no space to use it unless you were lying in bed. The bathroom had a lovely shower, great towels and Aveda products, but the make-up mirror was set too high for me to see into (I am average height) and you had to climb into a very high bath (no slip-mat) to use the shower. There was no full length mirror.The bed was comfortable but had a very thick duvet on it meaning that the air-con had to be a full force in order to get any sleep. Breakfast was priced at 20 euros - very excessive for the limitted offerings (which included ice-cold poached eggs), but Melia loyalty card holders (MaS) can get 2-for-1making it a bit more reasonable - I would stick to the local cafes. We got a weekend deal at 168 euros a night and I certainly don't think it is worth any more. The hotel renovations are still incomplete so be warned if you are not keen on sharing the place with tilers and plasterers!

<Content>ME Madrid - sexy, seductive and sassy A friend of mine suggested we stay at the new hotel ME Madrid, very centrally located in the Plaza de Santa Ana, an area I had known from past trips as a vibrant and cosmopolitan barrio filled with a wide array of eclectic restaurants, numerous bars and lots of nightlife.The suggestion that we stay at the newly renovated ME Madrid Reina Victoria, known formerly as the Bullfighter's Hotel (Manolete used to stay there and legends of the red cape always convened there) was fantastic! We knew the hotel was just opened - meaning that there were going to be a few final touches being carried out while we were there - but everything was so new, so design-focused and novel we had no problem enjoying it - we overlooked with ease the people painting edges of the hallways. The staff was also enthusiastic, everyone had a big smile on and made us feel special for sharing the opening of the hotel with them. The last night we were there George Clooney was hanging out at the Midnight Rose restaurant (they say the owner is Rande Gerber, husband of Cindy Crawford). A nice little ending to our stay! We only missed by two days the hotel's big party for their opening - but honestly with so much glamour I don't know how much rest we would have gotten done after walking miles and miles through the Barrio de las Letras, Madrid de las Austrias, the Prado, the Thyssen-Bornemiza and the Reina Sof铆a!The rooms while not enormous had spectacular views of the Plaza de Santa Ana and were filled with light - at night we found out that there was a sexy fuscia lighting that made for a seductive evening. The bed was really plush, complete with a super soft down comforter and good pillows. The breakfast - served in our room with an orchid (a first for me in a Madrid hotel) was delicious and very design-y. The only thing I didn't get was the super modern TV system... but a call to Everything is Possible settled my lack of techno savvy and they showed me how the thing worked (the same happened to me at the Hotel Arts in Barcelona... so I know what is in store for me when there is anything but an on and an off switch on the TV).We heartily recommend the hotel - and the ME by Meli谩 brand - I think things are going to get even better with time but we loved being one of the first few guests at this great hotel in Madrid.

<Content>Under construction but great! I made reservations when this was the Hard Rock Hotel but it was in the process of being changed to Hotel Reina Victoria when we actually got there.There was a lot of construction so much of the place was not open and dusty from all the workers but it was still a great experience.The entire staff was so friendly..especially the guys who stood outside the hotel and greeted you.The front desk staff upgraded our rooms and gave us a complementary breakfast delivered to our room to compensate for the construction.The rooms were very modern and the bathrooms and showers were great!The Plaza de Santa Ana location is very convenient and the taxi from the airport was 35 euros at night and 25 euros during the day.I don't know how it will be when it is completely opened in late October but if it is anything like what I just experienced, I would definitely go back!

<Content>A Lovely Hotel... We thoroughly enjoyed our 6 day stay at the Reina Victoria. The location in the Plaza Santa Ana was wonderful. Our room was a good size, bright, clean and and airy, with wooden floors and a view of the Plaza. The Plaza has a great location - you could walk to almost all of the major tourist attractions - and is in a popular area for tapas.The staff was friendly and helpful. Also, this place had a fantastic breakfast.A number of people here and elsewhere have complained about noise; it never bothered us although admittedly we live in a city and are used to a certain level of noise in general...We'll definitely stay there on our next trip to Madrid!

<Content>Safe-deposit Box robbery In July of 2004, my sister-in-law and I traveled to Madrid, Spain. We stayed at the Tryp Reina Victoria hotel, a four-star luxury hotel which belongs to the Sol Meli谩 group. This hotel is located in Plaza de Santa Ana, 14.During our stay, we were victims of a robbery, all our cash was stolen from the safe deposit box in our guest room.This type of aggression and crime is unjustified in a four-star luxury hotel which advertises extra security with its in-room safe deposit boxes, and charges accordingly. After all, guests staying in a hotel of this category, expect a safe, secure and trustworthy environment.In view of these facts, the hotel should have acted immediately, should have reimbursed us the stolen money without delay, and should have made us feel home away from home, which the hotel management failed to do.If you are planning to stay at the Tryp Reina Victoria hotel, think again. You might want to reconsider your stay at this hotel until management takes its duties seriously, and accepts responsibility for the welfare of its guests, their personal safety, and the protection of their belongings.We suggest that the Sol Meli谩 hotel chain conducts a total safety/security, and property protection quality control of the Tryp Reina Victoria hotel to protect its guests, and thus regain the necessary trust to attract clients.

<Content>10 week trip, worst hotel of them all Our family stayed here in August. We had two rooms for 4 nights, and had booked back in March. The most disturbing thing is that I woke up every morning with bites all over my body. The blankets in the room had not been cleaned. We were given two rooms on the first floor facing the courtyard. Even with the windows shut, there were drunk people outside all night long singing, fighting, being loud. The people at the front desk were not just unfriendly, they were rude. Refused to move us. We needed a van to get to the airport because we had so much luggage, and they said they could not help us that we needed to take two taxis. The two women that worked at the front desk acted like they were too busy to even answer any of my questions. And for the record, I never got angry about anything. They were all rude from the moment we walked in. I had emailed them twice before arrival asking them for directions to the hotel, and never received a response. The hotel was very difficult to find. Location was ok, but surrounded by hostels (at least 8 or so), so lots of young drunk people. Also had my wallet stolen right out of my backpack. Hotel staff could not have cared less. Would not recommend.

<Content>Great location, nice staff, reasonable price but go soon..... I can't say enough good things about the 2 nights we just spent here June 8/9 at the end of our trip to Spain. I had booked direct with the hotel (who guarantee to give the best online rate) and requested a non smoking room with a king size bed with little expectation of actually getting that. Our room was pretty big, on the 4th floor (a non smoking floor) and overlooked the beautiful Plaza Santa Ana, which IS a bustling place with many bars and restaurants - a great, central location. I am a notoriously light sleeper, but all through Spain I used earplugs (purchased in Barcelona at a farmacia - brand name is No Ton). It *is* noisy in most urban settings in Spain at night because people do eat and stay out late. But these did the trick for me, and I had no problems sleeping.Bed was extremely comfortable, and the room, bathroom extremely well furnished. As reported by other visitors, the breakfast buffet (which was included in the 120 Euro room rate I paid) was easily the best of any place we stayed throughout our trip.The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful across the board, especially Monica at the front desk who patiently and in perfect English helped us to find a location to return our rental car, and get gas, amongst other things. On checkout we mentioned to the front desk staff how much we had enjoyed our brief stay and were devastated when they said the hotel was closing... but only temporarily for a refurbishment. So if you want to go here, do it before November or wait a year after that and see what they do to the place. In my opinion it doesn't need any major overhaul but I am sure Tryp knows what they are doing.

<Content>Very upsetting First, we were put in a room facing the plaza. We were very excited until the noise from the plaza kept us up all night. The very unfriendly staff obviously had received plenty of complaints about this over the years due to their lack of surprise when we told them. We requested a room change and we were put in a room 1/3 the size (for the same high cost) only to find a few crickets jumping around and a shower that did not work. Finally, we were moved to a much nicer and larger room. The only problem ws that the molding was falling off around the doorways and the walls were chipped throughout. Also, you have almost no control of the temperature in any of the rooms, where it stays nice and toasty. Very unpleasant end to a tour of Spain.

<Content>Great Hotel - Great Location We visited Madrid for the first time in April 2004 and were delighted with the Reina Victoria. The hotel was great, the service excellent, the breakfast buffet was one of the best we've had in Europe and the rooms very very nice but a bit small. Still, that shouldn't stop you. It's a great place.I had read the trip advisor user comments before traveling and think I can shed some light on them. Some people complained about room size while the others complained about street noise. Four of us were traveling and needed two rooms. Because I had concerns about potential noise (Location is a very popular one) I requested a quieter room for my Wife and I. We were given an internal room facing a closed in portion of the hotel. My Daughter and Niece were given a nice standard room with a great view. It was a bit bigger than ours and had pretty wood floors. But because it looked out onto a busy square it was noiser (but tolerable) at night. Our room was much quieter but smaller and carpeted. If you prefer view and wood flooring express your preference. If you like peace and quiet, let them know. Given the friendliness and effeciency of they staff they'll take care of you. The hotel is in a great location and you can walk just about anywhere. The Plaza Santa Ana is nice and had a series of permanently tented arts and crafts stands with goods from just about every culture possible. The breakfast buffet is outstanding. In addition to cooked and cold sliced breakfast meats you'll have a chance to eat the potato omelets (more of a quiche) that are famous in Madrid. The desserts are great, with Flan, baked pears and Pan au Chocolate a staple. The coffee is good and strong and complimented by a pitcher of heated cream served with it. If you forget your razor or toothbrush, you don't even have to ask them for replacements. These are provided with your room every day.I made several local calls, and toll free overseas calls, and was shocked to see how little they charged. Just a few Euros after a busy week. Also, their fees for lobby internet use were very reasonable. They sell you a card with hour or half hour increments. Take the hour card which cost only a euro more than the half hour option. Finally, have a drink in their bar which has a strong bullfight theme. Very reasonable with a touch of old world class. Great olives to snack on as well. The Reina Victoria was a great pick for us. If we go back to Madrid in future travels we will gladly return to this hotel. We suggest you consider it as well.

<Content>Adored the Hotel and Location This Hotel has charm, character and an ideal location. Following a 14 day bus tour of Spain and Portugal staying at 4 and 5 star Hotels we stayed an additional 5 days at his Hotel. We found the breakfast at this Hotel to be the best of all hotels. The location is ideal for tourists who want to be within walking distance of all major sites. The Hotel staff was very friendly and the main desk staff speak very good english. We requested a large room with our reservation and received a beautiful 5th floor outside room with great views. There is noise from the square below most of the night, but after one or two nights, the joyful noises of the visitors are not offensive. We will definately return to this Hotel in the future.

<Content>excellent except for the outside noise Excellent hotel, friendly and efficient staff.. excellent morning breakfast buffet ... the best location for tapas and shopping ... however try and avoid getting a room on the exterior .. the nightlife outside continues almost all night and even the double windows don't help as you might like ...and we even stayed on the top floor ... otherwise excellent ...
