<Content>good for the budget I would give this hotel 3 stars.Location: rather convenient, near subway station in Causeway Bay, but not much shopping within walking distance. Near tennis courts in Victoria Park and few good tennis stores(one claimed to have strung Roger Federer's rackets in 2004 when he was there for an exhibition match).Rooms: got switched from an executive parlour to executive suite because the parlour room was just horrible: glass bathroom offers no privacy and occupies almost half the room, not enough closet space(the closet was a joke with 3 hangers). Some signs of wear and tear, stained carpet, etc. Smell of cigarette smoke though room is non-smoking..suspect people smoking on floor illegally. Clientele...ugh!! Smelly, loud. Always large group of tourists in lobby.Breakfast: we found finger nails on table...Price: good price for a suite on a high floor with 1 1/2 bath. But I don't think I'll return!

<Content>plush hotel but rooms cramped Rooms were cramped at this place. Location was so so since space is a premium in HK. Not much room to even turn around in the rooms with the beds in place. Quite claustrophobic but it might just be because we didnt want to pay an exhorbitant rates.The area is on the subway line but looks kind of run down in the day time. Easy to get to shopping districts but if you want to get to the famed outlet districts its best to take a cab which are reasonably priced.

<Content>Great stay We had a nice experience at this hotel, we were staying here for 3 nights on the the way back from a months stay in Australia. We were in an exec room on the 21st floor which meant we got a very quick check in on the 29th floor exec lounge. We actually took over our room at 11am which was execellant after travelling all night from Perth. The view from our room was to die for, we had an amazing view over the Harbour, stunning at night. The room was spacious, clean and full of all mod cons which was expected being that we paid extra for the room. We used the free drinks and nibbles service in the exec lounge every evening between 5 and 7.30pm, this was a nice touch. We also went to the happy hour 2 of the 3 nights we were there, this was from 4.30pm to 9pm and good value with 2 drinks for price of one. After that though the drinks were a bit expensive. As for the location, the shops and restaurants are just only 10 minutes walk away. A brisk 20 minute walk through victoria park will take you to the star ferry which will take you to Kowloon shopping area. ( 2 dollar one way ) so cheap. All in all a great stay and would highly reccommend this hotel especially if you can afford the slightly more expensive rooms as the extra service and larger rooms are great value. Will stay here again if and when i visit Hong Kong.

<Content>Great location and breakfast! Booked through the hotel鈥檚 website. Room was kind of small but we were hardly in it. There is a great makeup mirror for the ladies that pops up from the bureau and you will find the blow dryer there. Otherwise, there are no outlets in the bathroom. Tea bags were provided in the room.Included breakfast was wonderful. We filled up each morning on fresh fruits, eggs, dim sum, french toast, potatos, noodles, pastries.There was a small roof top pool which we did not use. Bring a Lan cable for your laptop in the room. Subway is 2 blocks away. We bought an octopus card at the airport for HK300 which included round trip train from the airport to Hong Kong station and 3 days of unlimited MTR rides. From Hong Kong station, walk underground to Central station and then take the subway to Tin Hau for hotel. Tips: When you take the tram going back to the hotel, make sure it does NOT say Happy Valley or Causeway Bay. These trams do not go in front of hotel. Victoria Peak at night was an amazing view of the city. There is an 8 pm light show at the harbor every night. Make sure to go to Aberdeen and take a sanpan ride. We gave US$35 for a ride (including tip). Go see the Budda and take cable car either there or back.

<Content>All round good experience We chose Metropark Causeway Bay as were on a bit of a budget, but for a much cheaper option than many of the other HK hotels was an all round good experience.The hotel is right next to the Tin Huan MTR station making rest of HK easily accessible (about 10 mins journey to Central) and only a 10 minute walk away from central Causeway Bay and its numerous restaurants and shops.The rooms were fine and clean, albeit we did not have a great view from the room but a take a trip up to the roof and you get excellent views over HK especially at night.Swimming pool was very nice though be warned is not heated so can be a little chilly!We did not try food at the hotel but did visit VIc's Bar as Happy Hour 2 for 1 drinks from 4-9pm is recommended.Other plus point was the Vietnamese restaurant (Vietnam Station) a few doors down from the hotel where we had our best meal in HK.Overall a solid hotel for the price and would recommend it if you are looking for something a little cheaper.

<Content>Fab Metro Park We stayed at the Metro Park for a three night stop oven en route to Australia. We were not disappointed and I can only echo the positive reviews of others.Although our room was small and had no view it served us satisfactorily. The breakfast was very good indeed. The live music (including karoke) kept us smiling at the end of a hard day sightseeing.Would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Hong Kong.

<Content>Good basic hotel in an excellent location We booked this hotel through Agoda.com and got a non-smoking, Harbour View Room at the 16th floor. We chose this hotel for the location, relatively good reviews and the free shuttle service to and from the HKCEC (we attended a convention) -- the next best thing to a hotel beside the HKCEC.The overall design of the hotel is simple and dated but generally well-maintained.Check-in: No problem here. We were initially informed that there was no room available until after three hours upon our arrival, but somehow we got one after five minutes or so.Room: As the other reviewers before me mentioned, the rooms offer only a partial view of the harbour and more of the tennis courts below. It was not really a big deal for me personally, as I expected it. Anyway, more importantly, the room was immaculately clean. No weird smells or icky carpets. It was a nice, basic room with in-room safe, complimentary coffee/tea facilities, mini bar and the usual toiletries/amenities. No bathtub, though, and the wardrobe was a bit small. Still for the price that we paid during the peak season, it was good value for money. I liked that they took the initiative of putting an adapter and an internet cable in one of the drawers. By the way, free broadband internet access in the rooms. WiFi in the 1st and 2nd floors.Location: It's not the most posh place in town but there's a 7-eleven and Wellkome nearby, a few small restaurants, bakeries, a bar, some book shops and it's a 2-minute walk to the Tin Hau MTR Station. The MTR is basically THE mode of transportation that you will need in HK. If you fancy walking around, the hotel is very near Victoria Park, Tin Hau Temple and the library. I love the location! Peaceful, but not isolated. I do think there's also a McDonald's nearby (but why when you're in HK), but haven't had the chance to check it out.Tip: When taking the taxi, make sure to specify Metropark Hotel Causeway Bay (as there is another in Wan Chai), near Tin Hau MTR Station. Better yet, keep your hotel keycard handy and just show it to the driver.Service: Efficient and friendly staff. Our cleaning lady was very friendly and cheerful, always greets us with a smile. I've no complaints. I appreciated the fact that they let me use the computer/internet near the lobby even after the Business Center closed at 7pm.Food: Didn't try the food at the hotel as the prices are pretty steep. Guests DO get 30% discount off the regular rate (for intercontinental dinner buffet), but as I said before, this is HK. We just buy some pastries and bread at the nearby bakeries/mini groceries or eat at Cafe de Coral. :) Cheap, good food.Overall: 4 out of 5. No gripes, really. It a good hotel -- great location, simple, clean rooms and good service. Although the prices of the food on the menu are pretty high, there are a lot of cheaper alternatives nearby. It probably just lacks that little extra oomph -- that wow factor -- that would push my rating up a notch.

<Content>Recommended We stayed at the Metropark for 3 nights before our trip to Bali. The location of the hotel is great - the MTR is very near to the hotel. The breakfast is superb. The room we had on the 15th floor had no view and was quite small but nicely furnished. The views from the roof were amazing. The pool and the jacussi were great although a bit cold !!!I cant find any real negatives about this hotel - I would definitely stay again.

<Author>scallywag22
<Content>excellent hotel in great location Having read numerous good reviews about this hotel I decided to book for 9 days. We have absolutely no regrets and would stay there again. As we did have plenty time, we were able to sit a couple of hours on three suny afternoons at the pool terrace. The views are wonderful.We could not fault the staff, who went out of their way to ensure we had all we needed, and offered advice on travelling around.As we arrived at 9am, we were delighted to be told a room was being prepared and we were in by 10.15 after an amble round Victoria park.We booked a harbour view room, and as seen in others' review this is often a slightly sidewards view, as directly in front is a school and many sports courts. This did not detarct from the views as it was interesting, for instance, to see all the school pupils in straight lines at 9.45am prompt, folk doing their early morning t'al chi and activity in the Victoria park as well as cruise liners and the Star Ferries etc and over to TST.The Tin Hau MTR is less than 5 minutes away, [for speed] as are trams[who needs to rush on holiday, anyway] and buses. Often in the evenings we walked into Causeway Bay proper after dinner -less than 10 minutes brisk walk, either via the main road or the Park. The library, en route, is the most beautiful we have seen and has great views from upper floors. It's worth a look.It took about 8 minutes to get to Admiralty to change for TST, over the Bay, although on several occasions we walked though the park the on to the prom at the front right along to Wan Chai/ The Convention Centre.Some nights, for speed, we ate in the Cafe de Coral, opposite the Tin Hau MTR, where the food is pictured- we could not figure out the Chinese language, and which was amazingly cheap- HK$79 / less than 拢7 for 2 meals of sirloin steak, with coffee! Staff there, too were very helpful and ensured we did not 'miss our number' on the board if they forgot to put it up.We did have breakfast in the Hotel a few mornings, and on some we bought juice from the Wellcome supermarket next door and delicious pastries from the bakers a few shops further on.As other posters have said, the hotel breakfast, though bountiful with cereals fruit and choices of eggs meats etc as well as dim sum, it is the same daily so can be boring as well as working out expensive by comparison if for a large family.While the rooms are not huge, they are perfectly adequate and very clean, as are all areas of the hotel. Kowloon, while wonderfully atmospheric by day or night was almost claustrophobic for us so the Causeway bay area around the Park and Metropark was a welcome Oasis.It is also important to say that at no time during the duration of the holiday did we feel at all intimidated, even when we got lost. To the contrary, people stopped and offered guidance, even taking us back on to the right road.All in all , we had a wonderful holiday.

<Content>Thank you Metropark My wife and I stayed in a Parlour suite room on the 31st floor for 7 nights in June. I can quite honestly say it was the best hotel we have ever stayed in and the views of Hong Kong from our room were just indescribable. It was a simply wonderful experience throughout - cannot wait to go back!! Thank you Metropark.

<Content>Loved the Metropark We loved this hotel. We got a free upgrade to a harbour view room and this really made a difference as we were not overlooked at all, we had sweeping views over the park towards the harbour, and we could watch the nightly laser show directly out of our window. As a contrast the non-harbour view rooms were very close to the adjacent tower block. As others have mentioned, the rooms are small, but are very comfortable. Ask for a high floor to be further away from road noise if this bothers you.The location is great, I agree with some other posters in that it isn鈥檛 right in Causeway Bay, but I considered this an advantage as it felt like a less touristy area. If you didn鈥檛 fancy walking for 10 minutes to get there, there were many buses and trams running very close to the hotel right into Causeway Bay, as well as the hotel shuttle bus. We bought an Octopus card which made getting around much easier.There are 2 mini-markets within steps of the hotel entrance and many bars and restaurants in easy walking distanceThe rooftop pool was lovely although slightly short of sunbeds. The gym area also had the same sweeping views.There鈥檚 a lovely bar which serves great cocktails in the evening and we also had great entertainment from the Chinese Karaoke crooners. Never again will I be able to listen to 鈥淏ridge over Troubled Water鈥?without dissolving into laughter!Overall an excellent hotel, fantastic value and a great location.

<Content>Exceptionally cheerful service We just spent nine delightful nights here and we can't recommend the place highly enough. Definitely spend the extra bucks for the view over Victoria Park sports fields out to the harbor -- it's especially lovely at night. The rooms are big enough, if short on storage, with unusually comfortable beds for China. While the bathrooms don't have tubs, the showers are more than large enough for two (very nice!). The in-desk vanity is a lovely touch my wife really liked, the place is spotlessly clean, and the AC works great, which is crucial in the steamy climate. But what makes this Metropark special is the enthusiasm of the young staff -- tremendous hustle and nonstop smiles all around. You can see from their interplay with each other that they really enjoy what they're doing. The assistant managers, especially Carmen Chu, will go the extra mile to make your stay pleasurable. The buffet breakfast is fine (skip the omelets), but we can't comment on the dinners, because it's only a 20-minute walk through the park to the fabulous and much less expensive local Chinese restaurants on Lockhart Road and Jaffe Road, and that's where we went every night. Going farther afield is a cinch thanks to the Tin Hau MTR station around the corner -- just a few minutes to the Admiralty and Central transfer stations -- and the Causeway Road trolley, which cruises conveniently down Hennessey Road. (We found the cabs and buses, while cheap and comfortable, tended to bog down in the Wan Chai traffic.)And a word about that beautiful Metropark rooftop pool -- it's not only a great spot to cool off while watching a smoggy sunset, but it's a fabulous vantage point to watch the Chinese New Year or National Day fireworks over the harbor if you're lucky enough to be there at those times. This year's National Day show blew our minds. We've stayed on both the Kowloon and HK sides on previous trips, and this is far and away the best value we've found.

<Content>nice roof top pool Stayed for 4 nights on a stop over. Hotel was ok, similar to uk style travel inns. Room was basic and small and bathroom good. Had nice view to harbour. Near to MRT stop about a 5 minute walk and close to convenience store. Roof top pool wa nice and welcome relief after a days sightseeing. Overall no faults, though not spectacular by any means

<Content>Great Hotel! I stayed in this hotel in august for 8 nights. There was a group of 14 of us and we were all really impressed. I had a harbour view room and it was great. The room was quite spacious and certainly not cramped! We had two big single beds and a desk etc and plenty of space. The service was excellent. We literally called down for an iron one day and within seconds it was there...quite spookily quick actually! Didnt have one problem with the hotel. All the staff were very curteous and spoke brilliant english. I am sure that someone somewhere had written that the hotel was shabby. Im not too sure if they were crazy this hotel was not shabby at all!! The cleaning of the rooms was immaculate. I also saw a suite and it was lovely. In one of the photos there is a picture of the corner of the tiling in the bathroom...this really worried me at the time but when I got there it was obvious that the markings were actually the pattern of the tiles! I could actually only find on fault with this hotel and that was that it didnt have enough warderobe space...but then again i am not known for travelling light!! As a travel agent I do not impress easily but I do understand the star rating system, as many people on this site do not seem to. If you want five star luxury book the Mandarin Oriental but this hotel was wonderful for the price.This hotel was fabulous as was hong kong!

<Content>perfect for sightseeing This hotel is perfect for sight seeing. there is a metro stop directly opposite and the buses and trams all stop right outside on the main road. There are a couple of shops next to the hotel where you can buy water etc. Granted the hotel is right at the end of Causeway bay so it takes 10-15 mintes to walk to the centre but even late at night there are no problems and if you wanted you could jump on the metro and take this instead or one of the trams. The staff were very helpful and nice even when I was making the booking they told me about a promotional rate which had not been released. We didn't eat in the hotel, it is however difficult to find places for breakfast in Hong Kong so if it is a prioriy to have breakfast before you start sight seeing it might be worth taking it in the hotel. The room whilst not huge was adequate but we didn't spend much time in it as we found there was so much to do. It was very easy to find our way around Hong Kong and use all the transport systems everything is in English, even on the bus stops it tells you what the fare will be so you don't have to worry about asking the driver or getting off at the wrong place. Don't miss the horse racing it is a great evening and again they have guides in English - take your passport and pay a bit extra and you can get right up to the finish line.

<Content>not as good as I'd hoped After reading some rave reviews I think I was expecting more from this hotel than we got. The beds were comfortable and the rooms modern...BUT there was a distinct whiff of stale tobacco now and again in our non-smoking room. Would have liked a bath as well as a shower and we had to reserve 2 rooms for 3 of us as only 2 beds are possible in the rooms. The harbour view from our rooms, which had cost us extra, would have been better described as a tennis court view. The nearby metro, however, is very cheap and convenient.The staff were very pleasant and there are good supplies of freebies in the bathroom. Tea and coffee making facilities were also appreciated.

<Content>Nice Hotel Stayed in this hotel in August 2006 stopping over on the way to Australia. The hotel is a little out of the way however is very near to a metro station for access to the main sites. The hotel was clean and modern and there is an office on the first/mezzanine floor where you can book day trips which we found extremely useful as we couldn't find anywhere else we could book trips, although I guess we were looking in the wrong places!Room was quite small but big enough for a couple who did little else in the room except sleep. The view was lovely and overall the hotel was great.

<Content>Wonderful hotel, good location I stayed 3 nights at this hotel and could not be more pleased with the room and the service. The hotel staff are corteous and efficient. The concierge was very helpful in giving travel tips. The room was small but clean and comfortable. There was a converter in one of the drawers, which was a blessing when I needed to charge my cellphone. The gym and pool were excellent and had gorgeous views of Victoria Park. The hotel has a free shuttle that takes you to the shopping area and convention center. There's free internet access on the 2nd floor (business center) and also at the public library a few blocks away. I found it easy to walk to various MTR stations and to walk to the shopping area. There's a grocery store down the street from the hotel, which made it very convenient to buy water and snacks. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Fine hotel, good location, service so-so We stayed at the Metropark Causeway Bay for 3 nights at the end of our honeymoon in May 2008 (the rest of the honeymoon was spent in Australia). We booked on the hotel website mainly based on the high marks the hotel got on Tripadvisor. It seemed to be the best value available on a decent room in a good location with a good view.We had booked a nonsmoking harbour view room - when we checked in at about 5PM, they said they did not have a room on a nonsmoking floor available. We had to wait in the lobby for about 15 minutes for the room to be serviced, and then when we got to the room we found it had 2 double beds despite asking for a queen bed (and mentioning it was our honeymoon). So we went back to the lobby and had to wait another 15 - 20 minutes for a nonsmoking harborview room with a queen bed to be made available to us. They apologized for the delay, but didn't offer any additional perks to make it up to us or do anything to recognize our honeymoon.Once we finally got settled into our room, our stay was fine. The room was small and the bed fairly hard, but I gather that is standard for HK. The furnishings were high quality and made the most of the limited space. The room was serviced daily and kept very clean. The location is nice - adjacent to an MTR (subway) station and streetcar line (makes it a convenient base of operations), and there are a number of fine restaurants in the blocks right around the MTR station. The room had a nice view overlooking Victoria Park and the harbour, and the view from the rooftop pool area is especially spectacular.Overall we were pretty happy with the hotel, and despite the problems on check-in we'd consider staying here again next time we are in HK. We were not as impressed as a lot of the other reviewers on Tripadvisor, though.

<Content>Excellent hotel for very good price Excellent experience. Close to MTR station, so you can be almost anywhere in Hong Kong in minutes. Very kind and extremely helpful staff. Great view from our room. Confortable bedroom and bathroom. The pool is the best! Great views from the pool and the deck, a must if staying in HK in summer.The restaurant was very good and affordable.And the price for all this was unbelievably moderate.

<Content>pretty good I booked this having read the reviews here and was forced to book a suite because our young child and baby could not be accomodated in a standard or deluxe room. As it was we had to have our son on existing bedding with us (two single beds) or otherwise take two rooms (but they didn't have any connecting available so our family would have been seperated). We found this a problem all around Hong Kong where rooms are small.Having said all that I was comparing the suite price about NZ$320 with what I could get in Malaysia, where I live and on that comparison it didn't come up too well. The hotel itself was great in other respects - the pool and views fantastic and the food and service were fine too. If you were booking a standard room as a couple this hotel would be great value and reasonably well located (though I won't say perfectly located - we stayed in Wan Chai later and it was easier to get around from there). If you are booking a suite, it was nice, a little bit tired but pretty good, though not super cheap. Still the views were amazing!The location, not far from the Tin Hau station and close to the trams that run the length of the island was fine, though it's a little away. I didn't mind too much as Causeway Bay is great and has tons of restaurants and shops. We bought takeaway food a lot because of the kids. There is a good Thai restaurant down the road (turn right when you reach the station and continue on the road with the trams) I think called Bangkok Thai (there aren't many so you'll find it). Sogo Department store has a giant food hall at the bottom and they sell excellent takeaway sushi (being japanese and all...) for tired sightseers.Overall a pretty good choice I think. In this price range, the best I could find anyway (but like others said there aren't many bargains in HK).

<Content>Hard to find I stayed at this hotel back in 2005. It was quite good for the price, but really hard to walk to from the metro station. It took me forever to find the place. There are many restaurants within 10-15 min walk, but just around the hotel there is not much.The rooms are small but cozy and clean. The bathroom was ok, with shower. The view from the window was not great, but this is HK and you pay for nice view... For the price I paid, I cannot complain.

<Content>Quite good value, outstanding view Stayed for 2 nights in an Exec Level Room on the 24th floor (2406 I think), this is important because the view was just outstanding- the even numbered rooms had the harbour view.Check in was in the Lounge on the 29th floor, this was quick and efficient. The actual room was great, had a very clean and modern feel, did I mention the view? The room was spacious with twin beds as requested. I like the starched white comforters/sheet combo as opposed to a blanket or bedspread - it looks and feels much more contemproray and clean. The room is divided off from the large bathroom by opaque glass/door which I also love the look of. Pillows were feather but I think you could request an alternative. There were robes and slippers provided also. The bathroom was well appointed with a great separate shower as well as very deep bath. Double sink and hairdryer and lots of good towels.There was a lounge and comfy chair and coffee table within the room- also clean and comfortable. A flat screen TV and CD player also furnished this area. A large desk ran the length of the room and a computer with comp internet was in the room.The mini bar was very mini- just enough room to squeeze some milk into. A kettle and pretty average tea/coffee was supplied but there was no complimentary water - a bit odd I thought.We had a fruit platter delivered on arrival.The perks of the Club Level were quite good although I think we were spoiled with our previous hotel (Regal Kowloon). The evening snacks were not plentiful - often the dishes were empty for some time, there was also a fairly limited range (compared wit Regal Kowloon), drinks were served on request. Breakfast was included as part of the Exec Level deal, it could be had in the Lounge or resaurant downstairs. We opted for the cafe- it was just OK, glad it was included.Staff were all helpful at every level, our housekeeping staff were very nice.We used the hotels shuttle service to the airport. The location was great- lots of litlle shops/food outlets and the metro. I would definitely saty again.

<Content>Excellent value for money My husband and I had a harbour view executive parlour room which was clean, comfortable and spacious with a seperate lounge area. The bed was particularly comfortable and made for a good night's rest, especially as the hotel is quiet. There was a generous bowl of fruit in the room to welcome us.The executive parlour room and parlour suite is good value if you make sure you have a good breakfast in the morning and take advantage of the complimentary cocktails and nibbles served between 5.30 - 7.30p.m. Nibbles included choices such as mussles, sate, crackers, cheeses, dumplings etc - certainly enough to keep you going if you did not feel like going out again, or to serve as a generous apetiser before your evening meal. We ate out each evening so cannot comment on the hotel restaurant.Hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Our first room had a rather strong stagnant water smell, and we were immediately moved to another room and provided with a de-humidifier which solved the problem. There is free internet access in the bedroom and access to 2 computes in the Parlour Lounge (for use of executive room residents only), and another 2 computers in the travel agent office located on Floor 2.Despite the address, the hotel is actually outside the Causeway Bay area, but just a stone's throw from the next stop on the MTR, Tin Hau. It is very convenient to catch the airport express to Hong Kong (Central), then the MTR to Tin Hau. Total journey time approx 40 mins.

<Content>Great Staff and really favor the Location Upon my arrival all the staff here is very very very helpful and friendly. It made me feel very comfortable, everyone from the check-in, receptionist, concierge, business lady (the most helpful and nicest person), up to the housekeeping lady. The room sure is tiny, yet very clean and comfy. The location is great, just a minute walk from the Tin-Hau MTR station, bus station and tram. The hotel also has their own free shuttle to Wan Chai and Causeway Bay area, which is very convenient. Another interesting find is that the hotel is just next to a coach service that goes to Shenzhen, so it will be a breeze should anyone need a quick trip there. Finding food is easy around the area, as there are supermarkets, convenience store just down stairs, not to mention some restaurants and also a pub near by.

<Content>Value hotel in HK but small The room is very small. I was given a smoking room at the beginning but reception replaced the room for me later on.It is clean and near to Tin-Ho MTR station. And the view from roof pool is very good. It is good value for the cost. (US 100 without breakfast).

<Content>Excellent location and value, rooms on the small side The hotel is in an excellent location, a stone's throw from Tin Hau MTR, tram and bus stops plus only around 10 minute walk through Victoria Park to Causeway Bay with Times Square shopping on your doorstep.The standard rooms are light and airy but are pretty small. Beds are queensize and there is only just enough room to walk around them. Bathrooms are a good size though - no bath but nice shower and plenty of fluffy towels and goodies.As you long as you get a habour view room, it's good value for Hong Kong. I can imagine a room at the back overlooking the flats won't seem so much of bargain though. The staff were lovely, nothing too much of a problem. Concierge extremely helpful. Recommend the airport bus which costs around HK$120 and also an Octopus card which you swipe on all publc transport - buy from the customer service kiosks at any MTR station for HK$150 ($50 refundable). The only problem I had with the hotel is the air con. The room was a little musty and smelt damp - although it was spotless and there was no evidence of mould or mildew in the bathroom. It felt like the air con was on recirculation giving the room a slightly sweaty/damp feel. We turned it off at night (lucky it wasn't summer) and this helped a little.We didn't try the restaurant as it seemed pretty expensive and bland for what was on offer outside the hotel (some fantastic Japanese on Electric Road). The rooftop pool was amazing.

<Content>Good location, easy access, good rates Have to agree with recent reviews. Super location for transport with the MTR, buses and trams to take you around the city just a few hundred yards away. Buses to Stanley and Aberdeen etc are also just up the road from the tram stop.We had a harbour view room which was fairly small as compared to other hotels that we stayed in Asia - but that is to be expected given that space is a premium in HK.Rooms are very comfortable, with comfy bed and nice bathroom and safe deposit box and tea/coffee facilities at no charge, staff were very friendy.Will stay again.

<Content>Very good hotel in a good location A fantastic modern hotel situated in the heart of Causeway Bay and well placed to explore a wonderfully bustling city. The staff were incredibly helpful and the room very reasonable and clean. The bar has a real atmosphere (karaoke a definite draw but obviously not to everyone's taste!) and the food served is of a good quality. All in all well worth a visit considering the very reasonable price to stay.

<Content>Convenient, modern hotel that overlooks a great city It was easy to get to the underground, hop on a tram or get on a bus from the Metropark Causeway Bay. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Rooms are clean, small but functional. When you visit Hong Kong you don't want to stay in the room much which is fortunate for us as our room was at the back and looked directly across into another block of flats and our friends room looked into a block of flats that were being renovated/newly built and was surrounded by green netting. No, we were not given a view over the harbour - do you have to pay extra for that we wondered? There is no lounge to sit in only a few chairs and low tables by the lift or in the bar. However the staff went out of their way to serve us when we hadn't book a table in the restaurant and we only wanted a snack. They moved tables, laid it with white stiff cloths and napkins and served us in the foyer outside the restaurant - the food still tasted good and we were appreciative. Each morning someone knocked on the door to see if we had any laundry we wanted doing. We have stayed at the sister hotel in Kowloon but this is more convenient and we would stay here again.

<Content>A High Value Option in HK We were looking for a comfortable hotel for an extended stay in HK and definitely found it at the Metropark Causeway Bay.After reading the Trip Advisor reviews we booked a panorama suitewith club access and were completely seduced.The view of the HK skyline was great from our hugeroom on the 23rd floor and the rate was a steal by HK standardsExtremely convenient to the Metro and several tram lines.Located in a real Chinese neighbor hood with many shops and restaurants near by.The hotel buffet breakfast was also great with many western and chinese options.Would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Brilliant Hotel Fantastic Hotel. Centrally located. The staff were great - their service levels were above and beyond expectations. And the rooms were amazing. Even if you don't have a harbour view room (and it's a real shame if you don't) you can still take the lift up to the roof, to the pool, and see the great view from there.The buffet breakfast was superb as was their dinner menu. And guests of the hotel immediately get 30% off the menu in the hotel restaurant so it's really good value.I'd go back to this hotel in an instant!!!!

<Content>Very Good hotel in Causeway Bay area of Hong Kong I stayed at the Metropark for 4 days in May, 2008. We had booked a double room. I was traveling with my adult son and they did not have a room with twin beds when we checked in. They provided a roll away free of charge, however for the first 3 nights. We checked out for one night at Macau and were provided a twin room when we returned. Our room was an Executive Parlor room with a great view of the harbor and Victoria Park. The room was large, with a small sitting area. The staff was very helpful. They provided free internet access through computers at the executive level check in. Breakfast was a small but excellent buffet with terrific coffee at the executive level check in. You could also go to a restaurant. The room was attractively furnished. The room was quiet with little to no noise from other rooms. They have a complimentary happy hour in the evening. The bed was firm but comfortable. The bathroom was large and well designed with a separate shower and tub. There is a subway stop 2 blocks from the hotel, and it is on the same line with a stop connected to the airport express. We took the taxi to the city stop for the airport express because we had a couple of large bags and didn't want to lug them up the flight of stairs at the top of the subway station. There are many excellent restaurants one subway stop way from the hotel or a short walk if don't mind the excercise. The subway line also connects a few stops away to the line that goes to Kowloon. We enjoyed our stay at the hotel and would stay there again if we return. There is a small market at the end of the same block if need water or snacks and don't want to pay mini bar prices. There is also a 7-11. Restaurants in the immediate area, were not great, but you're only a few blocks from an area with lots of shopping and restaurants.

<Content>6-week stay - thank goodness for this GEM! I arrived April 1, (leaving) May 10 for business - thank goodness I decided on Metropark Causeway Bay. I booked a Panorama Executive Suite - the room is very large, clean and bright with comfortable furniture and fully equipped. The view is spectacular and the extras included are worth the upgrade. I have a huge bowl of fresh fruit delivered each Monday, daily paper at my door, pm turndown service replacing any used towels, free breakfast offered from either the restaurant or the private Panorama lounge, which then offers free cocktails and snacks from 5:30 to 7:30 daily and free broadband (from all rooms). The Panorama staff is there for your every whim; the staff throughout actually. Maintenance is great and the room is always spotless, others are always around the hotel polishing, staff will deliver almost anything you require within minutes. The concierge area offers free daily shuttle service that drops guests at the Convention Centre in Wanchai several times in the morning from where you can continue to your destination very conveniently. There are two pm pick-ups from this same location. The pool / gym area has the best view in town of the harbour and Victoria Park. Location - MTR (the underground, Metro, subway, whatever you call it, you will not have seen a more spotless, efficient system in North America or Europe) is a 5 minute walk. The tram is always fun but make sure it's not after a day of shopping - very narrow. Taxis, first 2 kms only 16$hkd. And though it is located in an area that houses local small businesses and residences, it is an ideal location because it is not rowdy with tourists when you are winding down from your day - having stayed in Wanchai area last year, the difference is day and night!Being in HK for 6 weeks for biz would have been difficult were it not for this hotel and the staff (past 10-day stay at another establishment was disappointing). I am able to have a solid workout at the gym, eat fresh fruit and oatmeal at breakfast, get to work comfortably on a shuttle which I take home after work almost regularly, wind down in a quiet lounge during happy hour, and log in to continue working in the pm as I watch the harbour light show every night at 8pm from the comfort of my spacious room.

<Content>OK Hotel but nothing special. I picked this hotel because of the great reviews from tripadvisor鈥?and frankly I was a bit disappointed鈥?br/>Surely the hotel is descent, clean and everything鈥?but this is not a 4 stars experience鈥?it鈥檚 more like a 3 stars鈥?br/>The room is very tiny. And it really has no personality; it looks like a novotel room, only tinier鈥?I had a room with a back view, so I had nothing to see except the building facing the hotel鈥?If you go there make sure you get a view on the bay!However the hotel staff was very helpful, and the location was ok as it鈥檚 near the metro.The buffet was descent鈥?and so was the food I ordered from room service.The internet was free鈥?always a plus.I鈥檓 not familiar with the HK scene, but certainly for 100-150 euros, I was excepting something a bit better鈥?/p>

<Content>Fantastic view and great location We stayed in a Parlour Suite on the 30th floor for a week. The room was large with a superb view over the harbour and a big bathroom. These rooms also have broadband, lounge area and bar, and modern design. Everything was spotlessly clean, the staff were friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was excellent (Chinese and Western food available). The roof top pool is a real bonus. We couldn't fault the hotel, and we also got a discounted price through the hotel website. The location is excellent as the tram line and MTR stations are 5 minutes walk away.

<Content>Treated like royalty! Used the Metropark as a stopover for 2 nights en route to Australia. On arrival at 9.30a.m. our rooms weren't quite ready but the staff made every effort to prepare the room as soon as possible (still early morning). The staff were very polite, courteous and understanding that we were very tired! Had harbour view rooms, which were spotless, and well furnished. The buffet dinner and breakfast were both excellent value for money. Location was very good, next to Victoria park and a short walk from the main shopping areas. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Doors were opened whenever we left or entered the building, staff greeting us with brolly bags upon our return from a heavy shower! Well done Metropark!

<Content>Good location The hotel location is not far from Causeway Bay where all shoppings can be done, but better take the tram which only cost HKD2.00/person. Staff are friendly and they will make your stay as good as possible. I was upgraded to a suite (I guess because I am a regular) since they couldn't find an available twin bed room while I specifically requested a King size bed room since I was staying with my 3 year old son. Now the rooms are equipped with computer and internet, January was my third time staying in this hotel but each time I stay there, they keep increasing the room rate. My question would be is adding all those computers necessary to increase the room rates since most people go to HK is mostly for shopping purposes. Business people tend to bring their own laptops anyway.But overall, I like stay here since it is still cheaper than staying in the middle of Causeway Bay (used to stay at Excelsior but the rooms rates are ridiculous now compared to a couple of years ago), and location is not too bad, there's a 7-11 just beside the hotel and a supermarket.

<Content>Great Hotel in a fantastic location We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Metropark Causeway Bay. My husband and I were very impressed by the service and cleaniness of the hotel and rooms.The reception staff and door staff were very friendly and helpful. However, the bar is quite expensive, dated and often hosts karaoke which is loud and not to everyone's taste. The Forever Bar a couple of doors down is friendly and cheap.Location was ideal as it is a stone's throw away from Tin Hau metro station and the tram is also just round the corner. Travelling around was easy - I would recommend getting an Octopus card for ease so that you don't have to carry lots of change around (the trams and buses don't give change). The hotel is very close to the Viking restaurant (just by the side of Tin Hau station) and is very cheap with fantastic char sui!!!The hotel is also within walking distance of Times Square and is only a couple of stops on the metro from Wan Chai and a little further for Lan Kwai Fong for those who enjoy a drink or two! Make the most of happy hour which usually goes on til around 9pm.We were lucky enough to have a room on the top floor and it was 21m square which is not big but not a bad size for a city like Hong Kong where space is at a premium. Room was clean, practical and no complaints about the bathroom either. Unfortunately the air con is quite loud so ear plugs are definitely recommended!The pool was lovely to look at but it is not heated so very chilly in March. Fantastic view of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon though so well worth going up just for the view.Excellently located hotel for everything and good hotel all round. For those thinking of visiting the Peninsula for a drink - be warned, their dress code is apparently smart casual but men must wear smart shoes and trousers. Most women were very dressed up in dresses and men in suits so more smart than casual in my opinion!

<Content>Good base to explore Good place to use as a base to explore. Short walk to the underground trains, trams and plenty of buses and taxis.Food in the restaurant always very good at breakfast and dinner. We had a good view of the harbour from a high floor and our stay was exactly as planned other than the weather which was wet and chilly for each of the days. The horse racing trip is recommended and we will be back another time to see more when it's a little warmer.

<Content>Great friendly hotel Stayed here for three nights. There is a subway station 100 metres from the hotel so not sure why someone said it was far. The staff here were very helpful and polite. The rooms aren't the biggest but this is Hong Kong. You get a great view of the harbour light show and the breakfast is one of the best for value and choice for this star rating. If you're into exercise you can have a good workout with a stunning view from the 32nd floor.

<Content>Happily accommodated at the Metropark We had a harbour view room, which was characterless and compact but clean and comfortable. My husband said it was everything he wants in a business hotel, with a good desk, comfortable bed and tea/coffee making facilities. The bathroom was well maintained and very clean. Our shower (there was no bath) was large and lovely. We had an angled view of the harbour over Victoria Park, which was lit up and choked with crowds for the annual market - we were in HK over Lunar New Year.This hotel has a terrific location - it's a short stroll from trams, buses and the MTR. Times Square and Causeway Bay are lively shopping and entertainment areas, and only a walk away. Electric Road, the local shopping centre, boasts not only hardware (electric goods) shops, but a cluster of organic food shops, as well.The hotel breakfast was OK - we'd just come from Vietnam so we missed the wide array of FRESH fruit and pastries we'd enjoyed there, but the variety and quality at the Metropark was pretty good. The service was excellent - coffee and tea replenished at regular intervals by friendly and attentive staff who were working through the biggest holiday period on their calendar - with a smile. In fact, I thought the hotel generally had a happy feel to it - maybe in part because of the time of year we were there.Eddie the barman was everything a barman should be, and we enjoyed a couple of happy hours with him. Although the restaurant was busy we thought it lacked atmosphere. One evening, at the end of a particularly chilly day, we had dinner at the hotel, but because the restaurant was full, we dined in the bar (same menu). We preferred it.The front desk staff were welcoming and efficient, and the doormen were particularly friendly and obliging. There are a couple of desktops with internet access for guests in the business centre, but you might have to queue.

<Content>faultless, great location, great service Stayed here for a week in January in a harbour view room.The rooms are smallish but adequate to live out of 2 suitcases, very clean and housekeeping were always in and out in quick time.Hotel staff were excellent, there was a mix up with my booking (Wired destinations not sending through reservation) but hotel sorted it all out with no hassle. Also it was my husbands birthday while we were there, and with no prompting phoned on the day and asked when would be convenient for bringing the cake! (we have been on holiday for many years on his B'day and first time this has happened).The location is across from the park and a 3 minute walk if that to the MTR (Tin Hau is closest), you do have to cross a busy road with no green man, but is not that bad.Next to the MTR is a fab Thai restaurant, wonderful food and cheap, Bangkok Thai is the name.If your in the market for a tailored suit/shirts I would recommend Classic Fashions on Nathan Road, Tony was great spending time making sure the fittings were right and advising on materials etc. No hassle and will ship future orders. G.F National Court, 242 Nathan Road, you will get salesman approach you on the street and bring you in, but the least hassle I had.Would definately rate this hotel on all counts!

<Content>Great Little Hotel Stayed there for 5 days at the beginning of the year. Although a bit far removed from Central and the business district, the hotel is located close to a MTR station and it was easy to hail a taxi.The hotel itself is quite new. The rooms are small, but the views were stunning. The hotel is situated next to Victoria Park and walking from the centre of causeway bay, e.g. times square is quite possible and rather pleasant. The staff were very friendly. They even took the trouble of calling me in Australia, after I left a small box in my room, - which they did not open. And the open kareoke at the hotel bar was something else! Overall, don't go expecting 5 stars and be pleasantly surprised.

<Content>Not as good as expected Stayed here 7 nights in an executive suite. Standard room is very small and is very close to neighboring bldg. Other than the suites, rooms are small. Location is good except you really have to be careful crossing 2 streets when going to the hotel from the closest Tin Hau MTR station exit (exit B I believe). Using exit A1 from Tin Hau MTR station is an extra couple of minute walk but a lot safer to cross 2 streets. Desk lamp and TV remote didn't work that well initially. Cleanliness so so. Old TV. Service and food so so. Quite expensive eating at their restaurant (all 3 meals). Had a bit of damp smell (maybe from the AC) in the suite. Not sure if I would stay here again. Pool is nice and offers great views but it is not heated.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel We enjoyed our 3 night stay at the Metropark Causeway Bay. We had a standard harbour view room on the 18th floor. Above the 18th floor are the executive rooms (with sitting area, etc). We thought the room was quite luxurious and had everything we could possible need. We also managed to get a great rate through an on line agency (GB拢50 per night, room only).Breakfast was great - very extensive - but quite expensive. We also found that the laundry service was expensive, as well as drinks in the bar (but I guess that's to be expected). There was live music in the bar each evening. The rooftop pool and gym were open even in December. I didn't try the pool but another guest did and said it was a bit chilly!Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel, and Hong Kong in general. We had great fun!

<Content>Very good value Me and my boyfriend stayed for four nights in 2006 and thought it great value.It is a business kind of hotel, very modern, very smart, room small but very nice and always clean, location excellent, couldn't have asked for more for the money.Staff friendly and efficient.The only downside was the food in the restaurant wasn't great but there are many other places to eat and this shouldn't detract from the great value of this hotel.

<Content>What a Great Find Firstly I didn't enjoy Hong Kong at all. 3 days was quite long enough BUT the saving grace was the MetroparkCauseway.Not to be mistaken by the other 3 Metropark in the area!!This Hotel is situated next door to the only open space in the whole of H/K. Victoria Park, which is huge and full of very active people doing all sorts of excerise. The roof top pool was the crowning glory and what a view, especially at 8pm when the light show from the skyscrapers kicks in. Take the tram for 2 $HK and you arrive right into downtown HK.Buy an Octupus travel card but be aware their are 2 different types, I was there for 3 days and got the MTR travel free anywhere one,BUT it doesn't give you access onto trams, buses like the other. Mine was the Tourist one not the local one.Also Tea at Conrads is a must! Not just any old buffett tea but the full works, go with a least 3 hours to spare and don't plan on eating anything for the next day, it is gluttonery at its best!! Wasn't impressed with Kowloon and the best trip was to the Big Budha out on Langtu Island, quite a bus trip up,down and up again to reach it, but if you take the local ferry back, you get a wonderful site-seeing tour of HK harbour at locals prices 11 $HK

<Content>Good Value  We stayed for a two night stopover on our way to Australia. Although our harbour view room was small it was nonetheless first class. The location makes it ideal for the tourist as you can easily access Victoria Peak, CBD and Kowloon cheaply and easily via the excellent rail system. Tin Hau Station is virtually opposite the main entrance to the Hotel.The breakfast was excellent although we did have to pay 拢10 each.If we return then this hotel will be a serious contender!

<Content>Nothing special, but OK We had a harbour view room which was nice, but the hotel is not very exciting. We never had breakfast there, it was very expensive. The pool on the top floor was not heated but looked nice. The room OK in size. The location is a little off, but fairly close to a metro station. Information from the concierge was not reliable. Would probably not stay there again.

<Content>Beautiful hotel, tiny rooms, amazing breakfast! Stayed 3N, 4D. Beautiful hotel and central location, only 5 minute walk to MTR.ROOM: Stayed in their most basic room for about HKD900/night, which was nice but extremely small. Really only good for sleeping in. View was okay, only partial view of the water. Decorations were older-looking with modern touches.AMENITIES: Gym and pool looked great, didn't get to use either because it was so cold. Both are on roof with a great view of the city, except for the smog that is characteristic of HK.BREAKFAST: Great! One of the best spreads I've ever had, fresh foods and great service.LOCATION: As I said, only 5 minutes to the MTR. Nothing much in terms of tourist shopping close to the hotel but everything is within 15 minutes by subway.TRANSPORTATION: Couldn't find anything cheaper than HKD220 for 2 ppl, airport shuttle booked through hotel. There were only 6 ppl on our shuttle so it didn't take too long to get to the hotel.Overall a great experience, service at the hotel is unparalleled!

<Content>Convenient location  This is my 4th stay at this hotel in a Parlour Executive Room. The carpet in my room has just been replaced. Friendly and helpful staff. Very convenient location to public transportation. Excellent value for money. This hotel is located in a predominantly residential neighbourhood a the eastern fringes of Causeway Bay. Breakfast buffet offered reasonably good selection. Wellcome supermarket next to hotel to pick up bottled water and snacks, etc. Also many restaurants nearby over at Tsing Fung Street and Electric Road.

<Content>An excellent hotel which is a good base to explore! We recently stayed at this hotel following reviews from other travellers. It was our first visit to Hong Kong.The hotel is very convieniently situated near to the MTR station, tram and bus stops and was an excellent base for exploring.We stayed for our honeymoon and the hotel made sure the stay was memorable. Although the rooms are quite small, they are very well equiped with free Broadband, fridge, hairdrier etc. The hotel is very clean and the staff all extremely friendly. We had a harbour view room which was lovely.The bar was very reasonable - go to happy hour!Overall I would recommend this to anyone looking for a hotel in Hong Kong.

<Content>basic but great hotel The Metropark is a very basic but functional hotel. The rooms are really smallish, but they are the standard in Hongkong. We were upgraded to harbourview rooms and glad that they did because the standard rooms are in the back of the hotel, no view there save for the concrete jungle. Broadband is free, even if not wi-fi, other hotels in Hongkong still charge for internet access. Used the shuttle to go to the convention center, very convenient. Staff are helpful, speaks English, housekeeping did their job. No iron  board, no alarm clock, safe not big enough to hold my notebook. So I just left my computer in the room, nobody was interested in taking it. Great location, very accessible, not too touristy, I could say that it is in a quiet residential street. Lots of choices for a good and quick bite around the area. Would stay again at this hotel, I'll try to book the executive rooms next time.

<Content>Really Good Hotel Have just returned after spending 6 nights here. It is a lovely hotel, great value for money compared to other hotels in Hong Kong.Get a harbour view room for great views over the city, harbour and kowloon. The rooms are a bit on the small side but have a fridge and tea/coffee making facilities. They also have a hairdryer but no ironing facilities.I thought the laundry charges were a bit steep. There is a local laundry booth just around the corner that is much cheaper. There is also a 7/11 and a local supermarket nearby for snacks and drinks etc.Breakfast was included and was an excellent buffet with lots to choose from.There is a small business centre with free internet access and lovely helpful ladies to help you with tours or local info. Hong Kong is very easy to get around. The hotel is a 2 min walk from the MTR Tin Hau station which is 4 stops from Central. Also many trams and buses stop nearby to various destinations.I used the airport express to get into town (24 mins to Hong Kong sation for 300 HK dollars return) then took a taxi to the hotel ($35). It helps to have a map of the hotel for the taxi drivers as they don't necessarily speak english.I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>New, modern, clean, excellent service This hotel is one of the newest built in Hong Kong. It is modern, clean, compact, and the service shames most other hotels. The hotel itself is not particularly grand, but extremely clean, with lovely big showers and big, comfy beds. The swimming pool on the 32nd floor is wonderful, as you still feel part of the city although you're immersed in the water.There are stunning views out of the dining room, which serves delicious breakfast - proper continental, cooked and Chinese.We arrived early, well before 10am, and wanted to leave our luggage so we could explore. They immediately, and without prompting, checked to see if the room was ready and were pleased to offer us a very early check in. Room service food was lovely (yummy burger!). The staff could not do enough for you and were most respectful and helpful. The hotels location is at the edge of the tourist zone, so, it's easy to keep it real and dine with the locals and appreciate gorgeous chinese food at ridiculously low prices (拢6 to feed two, etc.).My only quibble is that the location means that on tours you are first to be picked up and last to be dropped off, hence with traffic, it can add 2 hours to tour times and your time on a minibus.

<Content>Would Stay Here Again We arrived in HK early and were able to get our suite by 11am as well as enjoy the complimentary breakfast. We appreciated the fact that the staff understood how tired we were from traveling. We booked the Metropark for its location and the availability of a suite. They have long-staying rates that make it cheaper than just booking online. The suite had a bathroom with a separate shower and tub in the room and toilet outside in the living room. My only complaint about the room is that the beds and pillows are too soft. Everything else is great!The free breakfast buffet selection is large. There are hot and cold items, Western and Chinese. The service is excellent. We never got the chance to try the afternoon tea or cocktails. The location is very close to an MTR station, with a 7-11 and Wellcome (supermarket) just downstairs. There is a free shuttle to Causeway Bay and Wan Chai, although Causeway Bay is about a 15 minute walk away.There seems to be a lack of suites in HK hotels or else very expensive. We would definitely consider staying here again.

<Content>Not as good as we expected This hotel looks great from the website photos but is not as flash in reality in some parts. The room had a great view but smelt horrible. The corridor smelt the same. We needed to change rooms and the next room smelt musty too. Small rooms, average bathrooms, very expensive over rated breakfast, but great service, very friendly.Overall it was OK for 3 nights, but would look elsewhere for next time.

<Content>Loved the Metropark I stayed at the Metropark in September having booked it with the hotel directly and getting a long stay package and an executive suite. I was there for 14 nights staying in a room with my mum and my aunt. We had plenty of room although by the end of the second week we had bought so much at the shops and markets the room seemed to be getting smaller.The location was fantastic and it was good to get away from the hustle of Causeway bay, the trams and the MTR were great, we bought the Octopus card and kept topping it up. We went to the italian restarent down the road called Zitis a few times and the decor was basic and the service wasn't great but the food was fantastic and more than made up for it, they also do take away which was great for the weary shoppers.The hotel staff were always helpful especially in the Panorama lounge and the pool was brilliant to chill out in as the weather was humid, We had breakfast included in our package and it was a buffet style with plenty of choice. To finish off the holiday we booked the hotel limo to take us back to the airport and it was worth every penny. We paid 拢1800 for this hotel including the limo which we all felt was great value for money

<Content>Recommend this hotel We stayed there for 7 nights in late October.We caught the train from the airport into Central but then had to wait about 25 minutes for a cab from Central to the hotel at 7pm.Check in was efficient and friendly.Initially given a twin room and changed to a Queen the next day with no problems.The room was quiet with a fantastic view over Victoria Park to the Harbour.It is close enough to the main shopping areas without the hustle bustle of Kowloon with Tin Hau MTR only a few minutes walk away.We had an early flight home to Sydney - there is a bus from the hotel departing at 5.35 am which costs HK$110 per person which we arranged through the concierge. The bus ride was about 50 minutes.We would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Busy hotel, clean and very small rooms I stayed here on a business trip for 3 nights. The hotel is located well away from the harbour and our room overlooked a run down building.The room size was very small, even though it was a 'superior' room. Just enough for 2 beds, a table and a chair in the corner.. only inches to spare.The hotel is very busy, always with a queue at reception.. it always took time to get served. There's no concierge service, just a very busy information desk. The staff were run off their feet and gave just passable service at best.The room and hotel was quite clean... but just overflowing with guests, it's run like a budget airline.The only English channel on the TV was Bloomberg. The internet was medium speed and at an extra charge using a card which was quite expensive.The breakfast was OK, nothing special.This hotel is ideal for a short stay if you just want somewhere to sleep and you get a room at a cheap price.

<Content>Good value long stay 7 days package We booked a long stay 7 nights package for an ExecutiveRoom for HKD$1400 per night. The room we got atthe 20th floor had spectacular view of the Victoria Harbour.The room was very spacious. The bathroom had separateshower and bath. The daily breakfast buffet includedin the long stay package was good too and we had ourbreakfast at the lounge at the 29th floor each day,very nice view indeed. The gym and the swimming poolat the roof-top were good too. The gym wasn't very big,nor the swimming pool though. I also stayed at the LansonPlace hotel for 3 nights and paid HKD$2000 per night.The Lanson Place hotel location is nicer (closer toCauseway Bay) but the Metropark hotel room is bigger,the view is nicer and the hotel has gym/swimming pool.Metrolpark hotel is at Tin-Hau station so it only costsHKD$2 on a tram to go to Causeway Bay so I think Metrokpark hotel is better in value. Both hotels have safetydeposit box big enough to hold a notebook but the LansonPlace hotel one had a socket inside so you can re-chargeyour notebook while locked inside the deposit box! That is attention in details!

<Content>Stunning views and super polite staff We booked this hotel through British Airways at a very reasonable rate. Normally we prefer to stay in small charming hotels when we are travelling but we simply fell in love with the pool views posted on the internet.The hotel was very nice, clean and very well maintained. We got a room at the 24. floor, unfortunately it did not have Harborview but instead faced a residence area which turned out to be an advantage as the room was very quiet.The view from the rooftop was simply stunning actually it was almost as great as the view from 鈥淭he Peak鈥? We had breakfast in the restaurant at one occasion and it was really great. One night we went for a drink at the bar which was great too although Chinese karaoke almost drove us away.The staff of this hotel was more than polite, always smiling and kind and they seemed very professional.The location is great for exploring Hong Kong, just beside a metro stop and with lots of great restaurants nearby.

<Content>Fabulous building, shame about the staff This is a strange one. My wife and a friend of ours visited, having booked through an online travel agency. When the 3 of us arrived to check in the staff clearly had two seperate documents for two rooms, one for two people, the second for one.They only checked two of us in - myself and our friend, into one room. with two single beds. They upgraded us but then got upset when I told them they had it wrong. It seemed they totally ignored my wife who was standing next to me because she did not hand her passport over (we had, wrongly, assumed one per soon, not everyone's). This set the tone of the visit as it was like dealing with the Civil Service or Prefects at school. Having sorted out the booking we then waited over an hour for luggage to come - I went to get it myself which caused some sort of action having had reception tell me 30 minutes earlier it was already on it's way to usArriving on the club floor we were checked out by an officious woman to the point where I was starting to think about going elsewhere. She acted like police and made us feel very unwelcome. Friendliness was not a trait the staff were showing.It got worse - the cleaner found a mark on the carpet and the duty manager rang, came to inspect it and asked if I knew how it had happened! I felt like I was being interrogated - especially when he mentioned burning and it as clear the mark was dirt from a shoe or similar. At this point I was wishing for my normal Exelscior hotel. The room was excellent - the harbour views do beat my normal place, the room bright and airy with a modern feel. The locality is good, very good bar two doors away if you do not want to listen to the karaoke in the hotel lounge or watch German football on their big screens. Structurally this is a new, modern hotel and the rooftop pool a gem. It only has 3 lifts for 32 floors so they are slow. As I was checking out I found the staff doing it lovely. It may me wonder if we were unlucky and just got a bad shift of staff. I think if you book a club floor Harbour View room direct you will be treated well, if not then it felt like anything could happen. Would I stay again? Possibly to give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe I got the staff on a really bad couple of days. Certainly I'm in no hurry to give them more of my money.

<Content>Excellent Hong Kong-on-a-budget hotel! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Metropark for a week in September and cannot fault it! It is excellent value for money, the staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and modern (we didn't have a harbour view room but by going to the roof you have excellent views across Victoria Park and the harbour). All the usual amenities were available, we didn't eat at the hotel as there are so many good (and cheaper, I think the breakfast buffet works out at around 拢7 a head) restaurants around. The location of the Metropark was perfect- opposite Victoria Park, around the corner from Tin Hau MTR station and other bus and tram routes and only a 10 minute walk from Causeway Bay (which is great for shopping and dining). Tin Hau itself has some great restaurants- I recommend Te Se Kitchen on Electric Road for some good cheap Dim Sum. I recommend this hotel to anyone who is travelling on a budget but doesn't want to skimp on comfort! I would definitely book this hotel again when I next visit Hong Kong !

<Content>Great for our short break Nice place at a really decent price for proper Hong Kong hotel (we booked through a thai website, great deal). It is not in centre of town but is 2 seconds from a tube line or you can do what we did every day for fun and get the trams that run all the way into the city. Pool on top is small but lovely for relaxing after HOT days sightseeing. So easy to get anywhere from here.

<Content>Great Stay We loved the Metropark. On arrival we were upgraded to an executive suite which was great as we have a 3 year old boy so it gave that extra room that made all the difference. The breakfast in the hotel was good and the laundry service was very prompt as well. We used room service once which wasn't the best so we headed out to restaurants on the other nights we were there. The location was great and we had a fantastic view of Hong Kong from the 27th floor.The room was a little musty smelling but nothing too bad.The check in and out staff were great and very helpful with our queries.Great value for money and would definately go back.

<Content>Great rate, convenient location Our visit to HK and Macau included a stay at the Metropark Hotel in Causeway Bay. We booked through the hotel website which was seamless and had great rates for the holiday season.PRO: convenient location to get to and from the shopping district (although Causeway Bay is a major shopping district), Ferry ports, and metro stations. Within walking distance to eateries nearby. There's a great bakery around the corner that has vegetarian pastries! Victoria Park is right across the street as is the Noon Day Gun. Great view of the HK Harbor and stunning sights at night of Victoria Peak and the Star Ferries crossing in the evenings. Quiet rooms although they are Japanese-style (i.e., small) yet cozy and relaxing. Hotel offered free drink tickets upon our arrival.CON: small rooms if you require tons of space. A bit difficult to find at first, but look up for the hotel sign right out of the Tin Hau station. A bit further from the central terminal than other hotels if you plan to head to outer islands such as Lamma Island or take a Star Ferry ride. But if you like to walk and have purchased an octopus card, then this hotel is a good location to start from.Overall a great rate, certainly not overpriced, a good, reasonable place to stay with a solid, courteous staff.

<Content>Excellent Hotel 19th June 2007Jean Glenrothes Fife ScotlandSpent first 6 nights of our honeymoon here and it was fantastic. We were upgraded to a harbour view room with fruit and a bottle of sparkling wine. Room size was ok and spotless. Visit the rooftop pool even if you are not a sun worshiper as the sunsets are amazing. One negative point is there are only a few sun loungers. We had breakfast twice during our stay and the selection of food was very good. Evening meal was ok but we found a wonderful Thai Restaurant nearby called the Bankok Thai Restaurant mmmmmm yummy and inexpensive. ( exit Tin Hau MTR station and 50 mtrs left)Location was excellent and only 2 mins from nearest MTR( TIN HAU )and aprox 10 mins walk to Causeway Bay.If you plan to use public transport then buy an octopus card which can be used on most forms of transport. Remember to return it at the end of your trip for your 50hkd refund or whatever has not been spent. Does not seem much but you can use it to buy a cup of coffee at the airport it your flight is delayed :-)

<Content>What great value! When we came through Hong Kong in June after an absence of several years we decided to stay on the Hong Kong side, as a change from Kowloon where we had always stayed previously.We booked the Metropark through Asia Reservations, who undercut everyone else, and took both the upgrade to a Harbour View room and the full breakfast package which was offered when we booked - but is not showing on the website now - give them a call and ask for it. Both additions were worthwhile. The view from our 16th floor room looking out to the harbour over the tennis courts and soccer fields of Victoria Park was like a breath of fresh air, in such contrast to the crowded high rise buildings that cover so much of Hong Kong. The hotel it is a little away from the centre of Causway Bay shopping, but still an easy 15 minutes walk, and in any event the MRT station is just across the nearest intersection giving access to one of the most user friendly public transport systems anywhere.The room was smallish, like all Hong Kong hotel rooms, but came with all necessary conveniences, including free cable connection to broadband internet. Add a very comprehensive buffet breakfast, helpful friendly staff, and you have a value recipe which is hard to top. Tip to travellers - don't miss the quality shopping at nearby Times Square - and the top grade restaurants on the top four floors offering a variety of cuisines at very reasonable prices.

<Content>good quality hotel me and my husband stayed at the hotel for 2 nigths in April. we found the hotel to be of good standard, nice and modern and clean with good facilities and bathroom. The breakfast was good value for money and wish we had eaten there on one of our eveings. The location is slightly out of the centre, but this was not an issue as there is underground tube about 3 min walk from the hotel which takes a few minutes to get into the centre and is very cheap and efficent, never waiting more than a couple of mins for the tube. If you walk, it will take baout 10 - 15 mins. the area felt safe all times of the day . overall a great stop of hotel, pity the weather wasnt slightly better as we would have sued the pool which is situated on top of the hotel roof with amazing views of hongkongstaff were also very helpful and friendly.we took at taxi to the hotel but found this rather expensive, so used the tube on the way back which was a very efficent way of travelling

<Content>good choice; good location My aunt  I stayed for 3 nights as part of a tour package. It was a nice hotel w/friendly, customer oriented service. Breakfast (part of our package) was terrific - much variety. Pool had a fabulous view of the Bay  Victoria Park  there was a good exercise room w/views. View from room was also very good (although HK smog was an impediment). Free internet was an unexpected bonus. We felt we got very good value.

<Content>A really nice hotel We stayed for three nights from May 28th and were upgraded to a harbour view room with a free breakfast thrown in! The room was spotless and the staff could not be faulted. Nothing much more to add as previous rewiewers have already mentioned the close proximity to Tin Hau MTR station,bus and tram stops etc. One thing that did concern me about Hong Kong was the air pollution, we actually caught a whiff of diesel fumes whilst we were in the swimming pool 32 floors up !

<Content>Wonderful hotel My wife and I chose this hotel from the Virgin Holidays Brochure as part of our Far East tour to celebrate my 60th Birthday. We loved the hotel, the service, the location and our view was exactly what we hoped for. We only stayed 3 nights but when we return we will stay there again. Breakfasts were good even though cheaper meals can be found in the immediate area and late night snacks were enjoyable. We did not find out until the last evening of the shopping faciliteis in Causeway Bay just on our doorstep and when we return we will enjoy these more. Overall an excellent hotel with very, very helpful staff.

<Content>Great stay !!!!!!!!!!!! My wife i had have just returned from a 5 night stay at this hotel and can highly recommend it. I would suggest if possible you upgrade your room to a suite we paid an extra $500 hong kong dollars per night but well worth it - the breakfast comes with the room and is excellent. we found we could eat as much as you loke that would see you through the day without the need of paying for a lunch. the service was excellent in this hotel very friendly. if we return to hong kong we would stay there again.very easy to get anywhere in Hong Kong from here with the MTR only yards away and so easy to use.very clean and safe. we can highly recommend a stay here

<Content>Silver Wedding My husband and I really enjoyed our week in Hong Kong. A suite at the Metropark is good value, we had excellent views and appreciated the quiet breakfasts and afternoon teas in the Panorama Lounge. Free use of the PCs enabled us to keep in easy contact with home. A swim in the pool was lovely after a day sightseeing. The location, off the main road, was great with easy access to public transport. The staff were very attentive.

<Content>Decent hotel I stayed at this hotel with my husband for three nights in May 07. We had a disappointing start with this hotel. We arrived in Hong Kong quite late at night. We checked in to our room gone midnight to find that we had been given a room with two separated singles beds. When we booked our holiday we had specifically requested a double room. My husband went back to reception to request a double room and was told that they had all been given away. We were told we could be moved the next morning. The annoying part was that we were not informed of this when we checked in and we got the impression that they had hoped we would not notice. True to their word though they did move us and our luggage the next day. The hotel itself was very nice and clean. At first I thought the hotel was not in an ideal location but after spending the day in the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong it was nice to get away from the crowds. The train service in Hong Kong is fantastic, so as long as you use that then location should not be a problem. Room service was fantastic, and the buffet breakfast was also good. Overall the staff were friendly and helpful and I would stay there again. If you want a room with a room make sure you ask for it as parts of the hotel overlook a residential area.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We stayed at the Metropark from the 21 to 29 April. Harbour view room was brilliant over looked Victoria Park. The hotel service was superb. Good breakfast buffet and dining facilities. The views from the roof top pool and the fitness room were again excellent. The hotel was very close to the MTR, buses and trams just purchase an Octopus card when you arrive in Hong Kong. Visited China and Macau during our stay. We will definitlely stay at the Metropark when we visit Hong Kong again.

<Content>Can't be bettered. Just returned from the most fabulous hotel experience EVER!We had a suite, consisting of, lounge with TV  DVD player, another TV in a swish cabinet in the bedroom.a bathroom , with bath and shower,and a visitors cloakroom, mini bar in room electronic safe, more lights and switches than I could count including a floor level light, and a bay window with , yes, a view of the bay, and the hills and dozens of skyscrapers as well as the Victoria Park with all it's sporting activities. The toileteries were abundant and extensive, as was the breakfast menu. The roof top pool and jacuzzi were elegant and naturally spotless with all round views, although I can quite see that some rooms may have a restricted outlook. Just a couple of nights, but it seemed like Hollywood, in fact probably better from what I've seen of Hollywood!

<Content>Excellent Hotel Having read the reviews on here we decided to book the Metropark for our 5 night stay in Hong Kong and found that we got the best rate through Thomson's Travel Agent rather than various web sites. We had hoped to book a harbour view room but as our stay clashed with a trade fair we were told there was not left, however on arrival we were upgraded to a harbour view room. I had no complaints about the view and given the hotels location away from the central ferry area, I think we had just as good a view as we expected. The rooms were cleaned to a high standard every day regardless of how late in the day we went out, in fact on one occasion we were at the poll most of the day and did not go out until mid afternoon and still returned to a freshly made bed!The staff went out of their way to make an extra effort in any way they could and the Hotel was really as good as we had expected. Only grumble would be that the Jacuzzi did not appear to be heated so was a bit chilly as was the pool. All in all a great location and great hotel for the money.

<Content>Foul smell with a peek-a-boo harbour view room When we arrived at the hotel late at night tired from our trip, we were greeted by very loud and unpleasant karaoke singing at the lobby. Then we were given a room smelled of cigarette or what ever that smell was. Even we paid more for a habour view room, we were given a room with only a partial view. We complained about the smell and the view, the receptionist told us that the hotel is partially blocked by another building and it's not possible to have a full view. We were also told that the veiw would be better in the morning?!!! We knew it's not true because we saw some of the pictures on this site. We were tired and didn't want to bother about the view but the smell really bothered us so we asked to changed to another room. This new room that we were given still had the smell. We were totally disappointed with this hotel because we thought it would be good after reading the reviews.

<Content>Excellent value in Hong Kong I have stayed in Hong Kong many many times on business - on an expense account. When I had to reach into my own pocket I asked business contacts where they stay when they come to Hong Kong with their families and universally they say the Metropark in Causeway Bay. We upgraded to a suite and we strongly recommend such upgrade. The suite is a very good size compared to many higher price hotels that I have stayed in (e.g., Conrad, Island Shangri-La). One great value is the 7/11 only 15 yards from the Hotel Entrance at which you can buy water/snacks/noodles. The internet worked fantastic and the location is great - especially if you are willing to take 10 minutes to learn to use the subway. There was a real bath in the bathroom which my wife liked and the suite had a small second bathroom so that two sinks could be in use at the same time when we were getting ready to go out. Downsides - the airconditioner didn't quite seem to work. Also I had some business in town so asked the front desk for an official exchange rate statement for calculating my expenses and they didn't want to give me one and finally make me feel like I was a jerk for asking for one. Other than that - on your own dime in HK - I strongly recommend this. HK is small and you can taxi everywhere from the Hotel.

<Content>Metropark - excellent value I stayed at the Metropark for 7 nights in March based on the reviews here. The hotel was great - terrific value. Thanks to everyone who posted!I booked a Harbourview room which was fine - spotlessly clean, an ok size, good bathroom, comfy bed. Internet access was free and a decent speed. Shampoos, etc topped up daily and a newspaper delivered every morning.It was nice and quiet but so close to the MTR station, bus stops and tram stops. Couldn't have been more convenient to get around! What a brilliant transport system!The staff were helpful and polite when I needed them which was only twice as the stay was smooth as anything.The food in the restaurant was so-so, I only ate there on my first night as I was tired from the flight. Whatever you do, don't go to the Chilli Garden a few doors down - my food (chicken) was literally raw and they still tried to charge me as they offered to reheat it. Can you imagine!7-11 and a supermarket just steps from the hotel for water, beer and other essentialsI'd recommend staying here as the price is great for the level of service and the nice rooms. The rooftop pool was also lovely with incredible views.On a side note - get the Octopus card and just hop on and off buses, trams, ferries and MTR. Fantastic. Pay a visit to the Peninsula Hotel (I went to the Felix restaurant for dinner - incredible!). The Peak tram is fun as is the bus ride to Stanley. Spend a day or more in Macau, interesting place. Of course the Star Ferry is a must and so is playing on the trams and getting the escalator to the Mid Levels. Amazing choice of bars and restaurants there.Great shopping, brilliant food - what a top holiday!

<Content>Excellent hotel, very well located Having recently stayed at the Metropark Hotel in Causeway Bay from 13 March - 25 March 07 in Hong Kong, I can highly recommend this hotel to travellers looking for accomodation. This hotel is very well located (close to Tin Hau station which has many bakeries and restaurants) to Victoria Park and the shopping area of SOGO.the service was very good however my only complaint was that the room smelt musty at time mostly due to the window not being able to open.The breakfast is expensive and I would not recommend it unless you eat a lot in the morning.All in all, I recommend the Metropark hotel highly.

<Content>A bit disappointing.... To be honest, after reading all rave reviews on this hotel, we were abit disappointed to find the hotel room 1) v. small; 2) smelly of mildew; 3) a bit pricey considering both 1  2. Due to limited space/availability we had to move in the middle of the trip into Harbour Plaza Hotel (Hung Hom) which in our minds was really worth the price since the room was 3 times as big as Metropark and no foul smell. Better yet, the view and location of Harbour Plaza were spectacular.

<Content>Best Value!!! We were there the first week of March. For what we paid, this is one of the best deal for hotels in Hong Kong. The hotel's location is very convenient, right next to a MTR station. The hotel is fairly new. The room is nicely decorated, and big enough for the 2 of us. We ate at the Cafe De Coral, and the dim sum restaurant near the hotel. We love Hong Kong. What we like best about our trip to Hong Kong:* The people - nice, friendly, respectful.* The food - so many choices, so little time.* The public transportation (IMO) is the best in the world.* So many places to see and do.

<Content>you can do far worse this is a beautiful hotel we asked if poss a room with a view of hong kong we had a really good room and view at no extra cost but only quarter of hotel rooms have a good view so ask yes it is a bit out of hong kong this makes no difference as the public transport is from another world right out side is the metro which runs every 4 mins to anywhere this is a nice place in general there was me and my wife and two sons 13 16 we always felt safe even in of beat areas such as pifer street market monkock a must when we came home we can see what England has lost RESPECT

<Content>Location  We stayed in the Metropark for 3 nights out of five in HKG, where the first two were spent in L'Hotel just round the corner - I've posted a review for L'Hotel also, so the location comments are very similar, but to re-iterate....Basically, the hotel is in a good location. It's a few minutes walk from Tin Hau MTR where there is also a bus station and a stop for the trams which rumble along toward Wan Chai, Central etc. Taxis again are plentiful, and not that expensive (HK$40 - 50 into Central, LKF, Airport Express HK station) and again, there are numerous 7-11's, bakeries and small supermarkets which are handy for snacks and drinks.The hotel entrance itself is clean and impressive - at the entry level you are met by a bellboy who will load your bags and allow you to proceed up to the reception via the escalators. Checking in was quick and easy - we had requested an early check - in, and a non-smoking room on a high floor with a view if possible and were allocated a room on the 29th floor. It was on arriving at the room that it all started to come apart a little - we were allocated a room on a smoking floor which didn't smell pleasant, to say the least. The view was of an apartment block, but we could live with that!I called the front desk back immediately and asked that we be moved to a non-smoking room, but was told that there was no availability till the next day - not in a twin, a double or any other non-smoking room! The hotel didn't seem full, but on reading other reviews and the hotels website, only about a third of the hotel is designated non-smoking which seemed a strange ratio, so perhaps there were no more suitable rooms. So, we were stuck with either paying for the Metropark AND finding somewhere else to stay, or putting up with it for one night. We talked it over quickly and decided that we hadn't come to Hong Kong to stay in our hotel room, so we decided to lump it for one night as it was just a place to rest our heads, after all.As we had missed breakfast at L'Hotel (see other review!) we visited the hotel restaurant for the lunchtime buffet after the room disappointment and were impressed with the range and quality of the food. It was very reasonably priced and delicious, which cheered us up no end and set us up well for the day ahead.The following day, I called the reception to find out when we could move rooms. This seemed to pose a problem - again - but after a little further discussion, a room was found on a non-smoking floor for us (21st). This room was better in terms of not smelling of cigarettes, but seemed to accumulate a lot of condensation later on in the night with the result that the air - con had to be on a high setting to keep the room humidity at a comfortable level. On exploring the hotel a little more, there is a rooftop pool which looked fab and had a great view over the harbour and Victoria Park - it's a pity it wasn't really the weather for swimming outside as that would have been fun! There is also a business / TV lounge on the 29th floor with similar views to the rooftop pool. We didn't use the bar (Vic's) although they seem to have a quite busy 2 for 1 happy hour!Finally, the hotel is very clean, comfortable, has good facilities (web access, restaurants, gym, pool etc) and was reasonably priced with BA Holidays. However, if we were looking again, we probably wouldn't wholeheartedly recommend the Metropark as we found L'Hotel a better place. And if you're a non - smoker, be absolutely sure that you get a room on a non - smoking floor!!!

<Content>It's okay My husband an I had a one night stay at the hotel. I suppose after the favourable reviews, my expectation of the hotel was raised, so much so that I was a little disappointed. The room was clean alright, but so small and it was facing an office block. So the expectation about a good view was quashed. It was located opposite the Tin-Hau MTR station, exit B2. Not many people seem to know the hotel, and we nearly dragged our luggages and walked all the way to Causeway Bay. You see several people that we asked for direction didn't seem to know the hotel, and when they heard Causeway Bay, they just pointed us to the Causeway Bay direction. My husband spotted two tall buildings just opposite the station and decided to walk over to check them out while I stayed with the luggages. Luckily he did that as otherwise we would be walking the next 10 - 15 minutes towards the Causeway Bay direction for nothing.I would rate the hotel as average and would probably like to explore other hotels if we want to stay in Causeway Bay again the next time we visit HK.

The nightly music in Vic's lounge, superb.Location, stones throw to the metro, or and old time trolly right in front on Hennessay. Took the trolly all the way to the end of the line at night, what a trip. All for 26cents american. Don't pass on this hotel, What a value.I'll be back

<Content>OK, but not great We stayed at the Metropark Causeway Bay in Jan/Feb 07. The hotel was new and the rooms were newly furnished, clean and neat and had internet access.However, we had a problem checking in, which is that we were booked into a twin room on a smoking floor when we had requested a double on a non-smoking floor. The hotel said that the agent did not pass our request on to them, and I believed them, but they did not fix the problem. We had to sleep in a twin room on a nonsmoking floor one night and then move to a double on a nonsmoking floor the next. The hotel didn't seem fully booked and I suspected that our problem could have been fixed by upgrading us - something the hotel wasn't willing to do.If you do not smoke, you absolutely should book a non-smoking floor. The smoking floors smell heavily of cigarette smoke.

<Content>Why only 3 stars? It has been an ambition of mine to visit Hong Kong for many years, so I checked with trip adivsor for an hotel  opted for the Metropark,  boy am I glad that I did.Everything about this hotel was perfect, I had a room on the 7th floor which overlooked Victoria Park (I was there for the Chinese New Year ,so was able to watch the firework display from my room).I did have some meals in the hotel which were of high quality, the service was excellent with a good choice.I cannot understand why this hotel only rates 3 stars as I could not fault it.As other reviewers have said the transport system is just a very short walk away, also another bonus is the abundance of little cafes  restaurants, I used the Chilli Garden a couple of times a very friendly Indian place,only about 15 metres to the right.If I ever get the chance I would stay there again.

<Content>Great Value and Location We (myself, my wife and two kids,ages 10 and 11) stayed at the Metropark Hotel in Hong Kong this past January for 4 nights.While some people might think that the hotel is out of action in terms of location, we found it perfectly located, quiet and the rooms were very modern and clean. Be warned that the rooms are very small, two single beds in our case (we had two rooms between the four of us) but that is normal in Hong Kong, if you want Western sized rooms then you will pay a lot more money.The hotel is located right off the main Subway line so getting around either by subway or taxi was fine. We liked the location since it was not as crowded outside as other places in HK.

<Content>Outstanding service and value for money The hotel was reasonably central in Hong Kong Island, being a couple of minutes walk from the metro station and then only a couple of stops to central shopping and sights. There is a park almost opposite, which was good for a stroll in the mornings, away from the bustle.Although it does technically have a harbour view, it is really too far away and at an angle, so not what many people would consider to be a good view from most of the rooms.It was spotlessly clean and a large and well-provided room. Although relatively inexpensive, we were really impressed the hotel overall. The food in the restaurant was excellent - we ate there on the evening we arrived and had a really good meal, and had a delicious breakfast there each day, although this wasn't included in our room rate - some people obviously did have an inclusive rate for breakfast, so it's worth checking in advance as it was relatively expensive but, we felt, still worth paying for. They have a business centre where, as well as providing tourist info and booking tours if you want them, they have a couple of internet points which are provided free of charge to guests.There is also a hotel shuttle bus to and from the airport, which is very efficient and can be booked in advance, saving a lot of hassle and concern about being ripped off by taxis etc.  We were very impressed overall and would certainly go back, and also recommend it to friends.

<Content>Location! Location! Location! Our room is small, but it is very clean, pleasantly decorated and comes with a free Internet connection. Breakfast is not included but you can enjoy it at nearby restaurants like the locals do; well, you鈥檒l have to get used to crowded places and sharing tables. Within half a block there鈥檚 a laundry shop that will wash your cloths by weight. Within a block there鈥檙e bus stops and a subway station. Around the corner there鈥檚 a supermarket and a 7-11. If you don鈥檛 mind to walk, Causeway Bay is only 15 minutes away. If you don't want to walk, however, the hotel can shuttle you to Time Square. Location is everything and need I say more?

<Content>Great hotel, bit too far away Stayed here in October 06. This was a really nice, clean, modern and fairly new hotel. The rooms were small and the bathroom tiny but who needs a huge room when you're really just sleeping here at night and sightseeing by day! It was always immaculate and clean and we even had cookies to welcome us, in the room.The hotel has an excellent view of HK from the rooftop pool. Its right next to a metro station and tram stops. There are also local shops where you can get food and drinks next door.The hotel is 5 minutes from the shops in Causeway Bay but we really liked being in Kowloon and wished we'd stayed there. The hotel seemed to be a bit far away from the main attractions but with the metro nearby it was only ever 20 minutes at the most.We'd recommend this hotel if on a budget but if you can afford it, there are nicer hotels in HK.

Concierge excellent,every request was handled efficiently  professionally.Food -a very high standard,especially dinner buffet which was superb.Breakfast buffet Or a la carte also excellent.HongKong is a great place full of polite,friendly people who really try hard to make you feel welcome comfortable. Rooms adequate size-spotless with great bathrooms. A top class hotel which puts a lot of 4 5 star European hotels to shame.

Terrific view from harbour view rooms makes up for lack of spaciousness.Excellent breakfast and room service at good prices. Good position - walk to great shopping in Causeway Bay or jump on a tram nearby. Shuttle bus every half hour.Would certainly recommend this one

<Content>Amazing View! Amazing service! Amazing City! We stayed there for 3 nights and were blown away by the view in our room, which we had to upgrade to a suite due to the 3rd unexpected person in our party. It was still super reasonable! I have to say that Hong Kong is now my new favorite asian city! The service at the hotel was great, and the breakfast buffet was very nice, everything was fresh. We chose this hotel due to all the positive reviews from Tripadvisor, and we would/will stay there again. Convenient location, close to the subway, shopping and restaurants. Can't wait to go back!

<Content>Fantastic value Stayed in the Metropark for 4 nights in September. It was clean, helpful, friendly and it's a good location to get around Hong Kong. Conveniently near the Underground. The hotel helped us sort out any trips or to find out how to get where we wanted to. I couldn't belive what good value it was.I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Value! Very nice, hotel staff was great  very helpful, room was small (common in HK). We paid $73.(plus taxes) for a standard room with a double bed but when we got there they said they only had single beds.available but would upgrade us to a deluxe room, I told them this was unacceptable as we had reserved in advance  wanted a double bed. They ended up eventually finding one in a standard room. It was very clean, the view was of an apartment bldg. directly behind it, bed was comfortable, bathroom was great, but the room had a musty smell to it. (I heard the same comment from someone else, so it wasn't just our room) The in-room wireless was appreciated. The location is excellent, (Causeway Bay)  was very close to MTR  buses. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Excellent hotel This was our first time in Hong Kong. We chose this hotel after having read the reviews on trip advisor. We found this to be an excellent hotel for the money. The rooms were spotless and comfortable. I would recomend requesting a harbour view. The staff were excellent and could not do enough for us. The hotel is a little way out from the main attractions, but you should not be put off by this as the metro stop is just over the road and the metro is cheap and easy to use. The shops of Causeway bay are just a 5 minute walk across the park. This is probably one of the best 3 star hotels I have stayed in, and why waste more money, we were hardly in our rooms anyway, with so much to do and see.I would recomend the trip to Lamma Island to both the Monastry and fishing village, forget the tours and take the Ferry from Central and the bus one way and the cable car and Metro back. For the cable cars, if you are willing to stand up, you can jump the long queue at the end of the day and you get a better view anyway.Stanley is also worth a visit.

<Content>Fantastic place Great location and great service. It's every-so-slightly off the beaten path, so it's in a quieter, more authentic, corner of Hong Kong. But it's right across the street from an MTR station, the tram, and Victoria Park. The staff are very friendly and helpful, but their English is not as good as those hotels that are used to having visitors from other countries. Still, they try hard and you won't have any problems coming from an English-speaking country. In the two weeks we stayed there, we were the only white people we saw, which was nice. The bar is cute and nice for a drink to unwind before bed. The laundry service is exceptional, though overpriced. Free high-speed internet is very good. The room was a good size, too. Overall, a great value. I was told by someone living in Hong Kong that this hotel is owned by the Chinese government, so if that creeps you out (some people have vague memories of Red China) be so warned. I didn't see any evidence that we were being spied on or otherwise noticed. In modern Hong Kong nobody cares anymore. Overall -- a great stay. I'll be back.

<Content>Almost Perfect We were really happy with our choice of Hotel but unless you are only staying a couple of nights (we were staying 8) you must have a parlour/executive room as the standard rooms are very compact. Having said that, the bathroom/shower were perfectly adquate. We made a decision to upgrade after a couple of nights as we were staying longer and we were really pleased we did. The parlour/executive rooms give you plenty of room to spread out and have great views of the harbour - considering the size of the room and facilities it is great value compared to other hotels. It may seem a little far out but don't be mislead - the metro is 5 minutes walk and it takes 10-15 mins to get to Central. It is in a fairly quiet side street - you will never get away from the traffic noise in Hong Kong but this was pretty good compared to another hotel we stayed in. We only ate breakfast in the restaurant once which was fine and thereafter kept it simple in the Panoramic lounge which was free with our upgraded room - only complaint here really is that the selection and sometimes the freshness wasn't great but if you stick to normal basics of cereal, toast, yoghurt and fruit it is fine.I would definitely recommend this hotel - we made maximum use of the metro, the 7,11 is close by as are some other key shops - chemists etc, the staff are young but ssuper efficient and very helpful and despite it being in a residential area it was pretty clean and we never felt unsafe. Only other downside is you might have to wait for cabs sometimes but that's it - we would definitely stay there again. Highly recommended.

<Content>Convenient and Reasonably Priced I stayed in a suite with two other companions for 9 nights. When we checked in, I specifically asked for a non-smoking room, but I noticed our room had two ash trays along with matches, so it was obvious to me that the room was not a non-smoking room. Since there was no cigarette odors, we did not bother changing rooms. The suite was big enough to fit a king-size bed with a rollaway. I was pleasantly surprised that they provided slippers, robes, plus toothbrushes  toothpastes along with the other basic toiletries. The room offered a great view of the harbor. We were able to see the Kowloon side of the laser light show from our room. Breakfast was average. They offered pretty much the same selections every day which became rather boring after a few days. Guests staying in suites can use the Panorama Lounge on the 29th floor. The breakfast selection was smaller there vs. the 2nd floor cafe. However, it is much quieter in the lounge and the service was great. Two computers with internet access along with newspapers and magazines were available. The Panorama Lounge also offered drinks and snacks during happy hour!The location is very convenient. Trams, MTR, buses, and taxis are all close by. There are also plenty of restaurants, bakeries, and supermarkets nearby. Overall, this is a good hotel to stay in.

<Content>A Good Modern Hotel I stayed at the Metropark for 6 nights in November and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The Metropark is a modern hotel located right next to Victoria Park. The location is on the main Hong Kong Island in the district of Tin Hau.Within walking distance, across Victoria Park, is the Causeway Bay area for shopping and restaurants and five minutes walk around the corner you have the Tin Hau MTR station which quickly gets you to most of the tourist attractions.The hotel is a modern 31 storey hotel. The hotel reception on the 1st floor is accessed from the ground floor lobby by escalators, or the lifts adjacent to the concierge desk. Adjacent to reception is a bar, which host lounge singers each evening.On the second floor is the restaurant and Business centre. The restaurant serves a breakfast buffet consisting of cereals, cooked English style plus noodles and continental. In the evening there is both an a la carte and a buffet. The buffet serves a mix of all nationalities; I would have preferred a few more Chinese style dishes, but the choices on offer attempts to suits all tastes.The main purpose of the business centre is to sell tourist excursions but it also has two public access PCs for surfing the internet for free.On the roof is a swimming pool, hot tub and fitness room with great views of the harbour and city.Most of the rooms are on the front of the hotel so offer views of the harbour.I had a double harbour view room on the fourteenth floor. Room 1416 gives what I would call a side view of the harbour, although I was perfectly happy with it as it did give a great city and park views as well as the harbour. See photos. The hotel has a slight curved front so other rooms may get a more substatial harbour view.The room was small but adequate, with the usual layout of shower room on the right with the room opening out containing double bed, TV, fridge, coffee  tea facilities and a desk in front of the window. The room has climate control air conditioning which was quiet.All the staff were pleasant and attentive.Close to the hotel is a supermarket and a seven eleven good for bottled water and very cheap sandwiches. To eat the best place to venture is Causeway bay which is a ten minute walk across the Park or one stop on the MTR. Victoria Park is worth a relaxing visit plenty going on day and night.All in all I enjoyed my stay at the Metropark and if I visit Hong Kong again I would consider returning to this hotel.Best bits: Close to MTR station, clean comfortable room, close to Victoria Park.Worst bits: Sausages at breakfast, not on the harbour front or in Causeway bay, Hong Kong air pollution.Best Tip: Get the Airport Express train from Lantau Airport using the tourist Octopus Card which can then be used for travel on the MTR for three days. Then you charge it back up with cash and use it to go on the ferry, peak tram, buses and use it in the supermarkets such as Seven Eleven.

<Content>Metropark Causeway Bay, great hotel, great location I recently took my first trip to Hong Kong, from the UK on Oasis Hong Kong, a new airline that's just started up on the London to Hong Kong route.The airfare was only 拢75 each way, plus taxes!!! A bargain that I couln't resist.I chose the Metropark Causeway Bay after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. I wanted a nice hotel, in a good position. Although I've stayed in a couple of Ritz Carltons in my time, I didn't want to pay Ritz Carlton prices. I wanted to see if I could find a hotel with the following:(1). a room with a view (2). inclusive food and drinks(3). a hotel that wasn't too basis(4). convenient locationWell, I can tell you that the Metropark hit the spot on all four points.I chose to have a Suite at $1400HK per night, because it guaranteed a harbour view, and was inclusive of breakfast, dinner buffet and evening cocktails in the Panorama Lounge on the 29th floor. Superb!!My suite was on the 26th floor. It consisted of a lounge, bedroom, a guest half bathroom and a main bathroom with a separate bathtub, and walk-in shower (wet room). In the lounge was a sofa, armchair, a TV and CD/Radio stereo system. There was also a writing desk with complimentary broadband internet.The bedroom had a very comfortable big king sized bed and a TV.Both the lounge and bedroom had floor to ceiling windows, with stunning views over Hong Kong, Kowloon and the harbour.The food and service in the Panorama lounge was very good.The hotel was only a few hundred yards from both the Tin Hau MTR, and Victoria Park.All in all a very nice hotel, in a very convienient position, that didn't break the bank to stay there.I would recommend it to anyone, and certainly will be going back.Just an additional note: I chose to use the MTR to get from the airport to the hotel, and vice versa. It's a breeze. The Hong Kong rail system is quick, clean and comfortable. The interchange from the Airport Express train at the Hong Kong station, to the Island Line MTR (Metro) train is very straightforward. The journey is less expensive that the Airport Bus, and quicker.My tip: Get an Octopus card from the MTR desk at the airport. It's a card that you deposit money onto. You place the card on a pad whilst entering and leaving the MTR, which then computes your journey and deducts the appropriate fare from your credit. The Octopus Card can also be used on the buses, trams and Star Ferry. Some shops and food outlets let you pay by Octopus card as well. Any credit can be redeemed (less a small service charge) by handing in your Octopus card when you leave Hong Kong.

<Content>Travelling with a toddler we did a 7 day long stay in an executive suite for the larger room and conviences of a the breakfast buffet (excellent selection) and other amenities. The pool is not heated so we did not use it. too cold. the hot tub is part of the pool and was also too cold. Weather was threat of rain most days so the proximity to the tram station, and MTR was fabulous. Taxis are inexpensive and abundant. The hotel will arrange a shuttle to and from the airport which was super and not expensive. While the website shows one large room for the suites, some of the suites are 2 separate rooms. I am not sure how many of them there are. This provided 1.5 baths, a sitting room, and a bedroom. Great for our toddler during naps. Our room overlooked the harbor (rm 2102) and the view was super. As advertised, there was internet access in the room (a plug adapter and cable was also provided). Additionally, there was a fridge and hairdryer. Bathrobes, slippers and ample storage as well. the crib provided was smaller than american cribs but safe and a good size for our child. The housekeeping staff kindly removed the coffee table for us upon request. There was not a DVD player, but a CD player and in the lounge upstairs a library of music to check out.Location of the hotel is not near any major site but with the mass transit so easy to negiotiate and the taxis so inexpensive, we found the benefit was an ability to go to Victoria Park a lot. There are many playgrounds, basketball and soccer areas plus a lot of paths for exploring. Additionally, with the city so small, it is easy to get to places quickly.Restaurants are not within walking distance unless you are adventurous. However, there is a small supermarket, 7-Eleven store and cheap laundry (30HK dollars for 2kg of clothing) in the same block as the hotel. It made for lighter packing. Staff is attentive and brought up a highchair to the lounge for our toddler during breakfast each day. The hotel restaurant is good and not too expensive. There is no kids menu, but many options that are kid friendly. Hong Kong is a hilly town and not very stroller friendly so plan on an alternative method of carrying your child if needed. I brought our stroller and we used it 50% of the time.We will stay again at Metropark Hotel. It was a great place for our needs.

<Content>Very good value Booked this through hotel's web site (Real-time booking option) for 1009 HKD++ (breakfast included!) Stayed at 2 5-star properties during the trip; Metropark by far gave the best value. Very new hotel, stylish interior design; good staff and service; free use of internet in lobby business center; room was smallish and no bathtub; it's great for one person or a very friendly couple. This is an ideal hotel as a base for exploring the city or if you're here on business. It doesn't have spa or comfortable lounge area. The standard room isn't conducive to more than one person hanging out there. Walk to subway is irritating; it's a one-minute hop as the crow flies but b/c of pedestrian routing around busy street, it's more like a five-minute walk. 7-11 a few doors down. Get a hotel card for taxi drivers; some don't yet know it. Elevators can get crowded or go a bit slow. Great value; clean, safe, good staff.

<Content>Good 3 star hotel. Stayed at the Metropark for 10 nights having booked the long stay package through their website. It was in a Harbour view room.Had two take a room with two single beds for two nights even though i confirmed all my requests, including a double bed a week previous. But i was just glad they had a room ready for us at 9pm in the evening after a long day travelling.The room itself was okay, just your typical 3 star setup. Was clean, reasonably quiet with a good view. We didnt feel that it was that small either.The hotel itself was fine, the staff where always friendly. Wasnt impressed by our meal in the restaurant and we didnt venture into the bar for a drink either due to the terrible singers that performed every night, im glad i couldnt hear them from my room!.Location wise it was alright for the first few days but then the walk to the MTR got a bit tiresome. And the hotel just seemed a bit out of the way. But there was plenty transport alternatives around like the trams and buses.All in all i feel we got what we payed for, so in that respect the hotel done its job. I'd defintely go for something a bit closer to the main areas of HK island next time.

<Content>PRACTICAL, AND THAT'S IT i really cant understand the people who get all exited and give 5 star ratings to a hotel only for being clean... metropark hotel is your motel 6 on heels.... it's clean, it's spacious... but that's it. the bar is horrible, the food sucks, the design is terrible. if you are looking for the mimimun - cleanliness - go there. if you are looking for an experiance - don't even think about it.

<Content>Very nice 鈥榣ong stay鈥?package The Metropark hotel is a very nice hotel, situated in the North of Hongkong Island. With harbour view rooms you can see sport grounds in front and of course the harbour with all the daily excitements and Kowloon (mainland). It is a 5-minute walk to the metro or to several bus stops. My husband and I stayed here for one week in May 2006 and booked in advance a so called 鈥榣ong stay package鈥?direct with the hotel. We had a beautiful spacious suite with magnificent view, comfortable bed, sitting area and a huge bathroom with separate shower and bad. There is a coffeemaker and fridge, plenty of space for personal items and a desk with chair. The service is unbelievable; sometimes we even felt a little embarrassed, two till up to three times a day, clean towels!!!! With this executive suite deal there are much more benefits, express check-in and out, access to the executive floor 鈥?Panorama Lounge - with complementary breakfast (you can also have your free breakfast in the restaurant, which we did, much more items to choose from), computers with free Internet, the whole day free coffee and tea and in the evening free cocktails. Especially this was very nice, from 5:00 till 7:30 p.m free drinks and snacks. They offer all kinds of alcoholic drinks, the quality of the red wine we had was very good. You will also have 20% discount on Food and Beverage in the bar and restaurant (we can recommend the diner buffet) All the employees were very friendly. We had a lovely stay and can surely recommend this hotel.

<Author>Shanghaisol
<Content>Very pleased. My colleague and I needed a more budget-minded option for a quick business trip to Hong Kong from our offices in Shanghai. Based on the reviews of this site, I booked the Metropark. I was very pleased. Of note for those who might have early morning appointments: The fitness center officially opens at 7 a.m. As the center is directly accessible from the elevators, though, you can go in early should you wish to - as we did. The Metropark is just a block down the street from the Tin Hau subway stop as well. Our meetings finished early and we had some time to kill before our outbound flight, so we took the metro one stop to the Causeway Bay stop (HK$4 each, one way) to do some shopping in the large Times Square shopping center. For those of you who book the hotel shuttle (HK$140 per person, one way), keep in mind that it's a bus that leaves at pre-set times with a group of people to drop at various hotels, which may mean you'll wait a bit for the shuttle to depart (like we did) and have the delay of stopping at various hotels en route (like we did).

<Content>Fantastic Stayed at the Mertopark Causeway Bay for 3 nights at the end of September 2006. We took the hotel shuttle bus from the airport as we were arriving very late into HK - last shuttle left around 11.45pm. Costs HK$140 each but it was a very very luxurious bus and at that time of night it was nice to snooze in comfort. Arrived at hotel at 1.30am. We had booked a Harbour View Room and were upgraded to an Executive suite. Result!!! First time we've ever been upgraded in a hotel so didn't know what to expect but were very pleasantly surprised. We had two separate rooms, both with spectacular views of the Harbour across Victoria Park. The lounge had a settee, chair, coffee table, large TV, CD player and desk area. There was also a bar area and a second toilet. The bedroom was an OK size but not a lot of room around the bed but when you've got a whole other room to spread out into who's complaining. There was a second TV which also had a DVD player incorporated. The bathroom was lovely with a large bath and a huge shower cubicle. Bed was big and nicely presented. Breakfast was served in the second floor restaurant but finishes at 10.30am. There is nothing in the hotel directory to tell you this so we nearly missed out after having a lie in after our late arrival. There was a great selection on offer. Fresh fruit juice and fresh fruit, youghurts, breads and pastries, cereals, all the usual suspects for a cooked breakfast, along with dim sum and noodle soup. All good. Breakfast for 2 was HK$280 (拢20) - not too bad. Location is superb - views over the harbour and the park are great. The Tin Hau metro station is 2 min walk (honest) at the bottom of the road which is on the main line. Times Square shopping mall is about a 15 min walk into to the Causeway Bay area. Our first full day we arranged a half day city tour at the hotel tour desk for that afternoon. Pool on the roof is fairly small and the water is quite cold but the views make up for that. Area is quiet at night so no problems sleeping. Couldn't have asked for much more from the Metropark. If we were back in HK we would definately be staying at the Metropark, Causeway Bay.

<Content>Great Value Hong Kong Hotel I stayed at the Metropark for three nights in September 2006 and have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The room and bathroom were clean and the bathroom instead of the usual shower with curtain over the bath had a wonderful large walk in cubicle with an extremely powerful shower.Staff were friendly and efficient and an added bonus was free use of the internet in the business centre.Would definitely recommend this hotel to other travellers.

<Content>Great hotel! We booked this hotel three days prior to our arrival and did not expect it to be such a clean, friendly, upscale property. Our original accommodations fell through and we were frantic trying to find a place that would be comfortable, affordable and in a good location. Based on the many prior reviews, we booked one of the executive suites and were so very happy with the room. You check in at the executive club/lounge which is so comfortable and quiet and so great after a 14 hour flight. They can answer any and all questions as everyone up there is fluent in English and can provide maps, suggestions for restaurants, etc. All of the executive suites have views of the city as well as huge bathrooms. The sitting area is great for resting after a long day of touring and the wall mounted CD player is an added bonus. Breakfast is served up in the lounge for those in suites but the restaurant has more options including an omlette bar. The workout room is fabulous and you don't even need your iPod because all the cardio machines face the city and the harbour and the views are breathtaking. I found this hotel on many sites but decided to check their website hotel specials and found a rate of about $200 U.S. for the suite incl. breakfast. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel and I have never written a hotel review before but I thought this was such a nice hotel for the price and hopefully someone will benefit from my review.

<Content>Great Location, Modern Rooms Stayed in 2004 January for NY Eve. Great, hotel in a centralized area. Causeway bay. It's walkable to the shopping area (10 mins) or by tram right outside (two stops) to the busy shopping area. Will definitely stay again. Rooms are small like most HK hotels but which one isn't. Room was clean and decently modern. I wouldn't pay more that $100 USD if possible per night.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights at the end of September and found it fantastic both for value and location in Hong Kong. It's very smart, clean and quiet with outstanding views from the Harbour View rooms and even if you were staying in HK for one night only I would highly recomend this hotel because simply by looking out of your window you get a fantastic feel for the place.The rooms arn't massive but absolutly adequate and the bed was one of the most comfortable i've slept on. The Roof top pool offers amaazing views and is always quiet at night - where you can have a cooling swim before hitting the town once more !The metro is literally just over the road so you can be central in a matter of 15 mins and a stroll through adjacent Victoria Park is a must, to see the locals doing their stuff !Overall I highly recomend this hotel, which is available at fantastic rates with a little research.Top HK Tip: Go to Lamma Island for the best seafood in the world !!!! Lamcombe Seafood Resturant at Yung Shue Wan and Lamma Hilton Shum Kee Seafood Resturant both absolutly fantastic !!!!

<Content>Great Hotel in a quiet location We were very ppleased with this hotel helped by the fact that we were immediately upgraded from a standard to a harbour view room. The rooms are spacious and well appointed, bathrooms are excellent and a CD plaer as well as a cable TV is provided. The hotel pool is small but as this is primarily a business hotel it is usually not used too much during the day - the views from the pool are ioutstanding. The buffet style breakfasts are very good and we had one evening meal in the restaurant and that was quite good, but don't expect fine dining. The Tin Hau metro station is just across the street that makes it very convenient as the metro in Hong Kong was one of the best we experienced (including France and London). Local shopping is limited to food and drinks (2 good supermarkets nearby) and some small lkocal restaurants. The Gardens and Zoo are definitely worth a visit and the peak tram and the view is amazing on a clear day. Shopping in Kowloon is an experience in itself - know your prices before you go to Hong Kong and you should be able to get some good prices - clothing, footwear, sunglasses, replica watches and handbags - good range of electronics but it is not much cheaper than at home

<Content>Pleasant stay at the Metropark We stayed for 5 nights at a suite with a great harbour view. Agree with most reviewers that hotel rooms in HK run on the small side; but then again, you're not really there to stay in the hotel room.We enjoyed the breakfast buffet, the service at the Metropark and above all, the proximity to the Tin Hau MTR station. The Time Square shopping mall was one MTR station away, and was home to a great grocery store (City Super), and all the main shops you would need. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel I booked an executive suite for my husband, son and I. It had a bedroom,living room, which was used as my son's bedroom, plus two bathrooms. The suite cost about the same as two separate rooms but it meant we were entitled to use the executive floor, which we found very useful.We arrived at 9a.m. after a long flight from London. Our room wasn't ready, but they offered us breakfast while we waited. The view over Hong Kong Harbour was wonderful, and after breakfast and a short while using their internet facilities our room was ready.Afternoon tea was provided on the executive floor, which was really refreshing after a busy day sightseeing and before we went out in the evening drinks and small snacks were available between 5  7p.m.The hotel is slightly out of the centre of town, but the trams run so frequently and the subway is also really close.The pool is not big, but the view from the rooftop fantastic.On our last day we had to check out at 5.30a.m. and they offered us a packed breakfast to take to eat at the airport. By booking the executive suite we received so many little extras and the staff could not have been more helpful.

<Content>I did't want to leave!!!! My son  I stayed here Aug 06, and I must say we had an excellent time in HK. It started when we arrived at the hotel at 7am coming from Beijing. We had to go to the 29th floor to check in because we had an executive clubroom. So I was just expecting to drop off my bags  come back in the afternoon to check in. This wasn鈥檛 the case they informed me that I could check in now which was a surprise (never happen to me before). After she told me that I then let them know that my credit cards were cancelled/on hold for fraud  that one of them won鈥檛 be active until the next day. I had told the stupid credit card company  my bank that I was going to Asia but the put both my cards on hold after they saw charges in Beijing. Anyways, the check-in clerk spoke w/ the on duty Manager  they said that it would be no problem I鈥檒l just have to leave a nights deposit then finish the check in the next day. Well all I had was $600HK cash  the room was $1200Hk. After talking to each other a bit in Chinese the girl said I could just leave a $500 deposit (leaving some cash for me to eat). Then they noticed that my Res was for a double bed but they informed me that the best viewing room was avail but it only has a king bed w/ separate living room plus 1 陆 bahrooms. Once we saw it my son was sold he loved, the room had a sofa, chair, desk w/ chair, a bench, bar, entertainment center. Then in the bedroom another Enter. Center. The bathroom was just beautiful; it had a sep shower  huge tub. Extra long vanity sink. The entire suite had a panoramic view of The Harbor and Victoria Park. FYI, Victoria Park is enormous it has like 20 Tennis Courts, 8 Basketball courts, Soccer field, 2 swimming pools and various other fields if you have kids this is a perfect hotel to stay at. Plus around the corner you have McDonalds, 7 Eleven, and a Game Room. Back to the hotel, the next day we finished check-in and we got everything fixed w/ the bank I felt better. I forgot to mention that also during check-in they gave me 2 free drink tickets to the hotel bar. Plus because I had a clubroom we got free breakfast. We cold either go to the rest on the 2nd fl or we could use the Club Lounge on the 29th fl. Also in the evenings they served free drinks  light snacks in the Club lounge (kids could also come). We preferred using the CL during breakfast because it was less crowded and served some of the things from the full rest on the lower level. I鈥檓 not a big Breakfast person so I opted for the quietness of the CL. Make sure to try the spring rolls if they serve them they were excellent even my 13yr son loved them and he鈥檚 a picky eater. The entire staff is very friendly  helpful; they remember your name  what you drink in the evenings. One staff person had just return from vacation  she knew my name  what I drink before I could tell her. One of my co-workers pointed out to me that I was prob the only African-AM at the hotel so it would be hard to miss me, but that little bit of detail still made me fell good.We wound up staying 6 days and would def go back again.

<Content>Perfect deal for a cool stay in HK My wife and I spent three nights at Metropark Hotel in Hong Kong in August 2006. We enjoyed our stay there, as we had the overall impression to have found a very good compromise (comfort/location) for a reasonable price.Booking : very esay through hotel website, just make sure to get owest possible price by scrolling down the whole page (loest prices are often at the end of the page). We finally paid around 120 鈧?per night including breakfast, for a 42 sqm suite.Location : not perfectly central (not a walking distance from Kowloon or Central), but we found this to be and advantage towards other HK hotels. In fact, you can benefit from immediate access to the subway (2 min walk, 200 m from Tin Hau), and open view on the hong-kong bay. In addition, it is an advantage as well to escape after an active from the busy crowdy city center.Room : we had 42 sqm suite. It must be said we did not have the impression to have such a surface. Nevertheless, room was overall spacious (bed + sort of small living room with sofa and chair). Being at 21st floor, view was really impressive (park in front row and then in the same landscape HK and Kowloon skylines). Room was clean, even if carpet and floor suffered from several cigarette burnt holes.Food : we tried both buffet restaurant and private vip breakfast space in the uppest floor. The first one offers a great choice of both asian and european dishes, bith fresh and with large choice. The vip room offers less choice, but a much more quiet atmosfear, and a wonderful view (buffet restaurant at first floor is a huge room, which may become noisy).In a nutshell, having made our choice thanks to other Tripadvisor positive comments, we had no suprise to be vedry satisfied.

<Content>Too-small room for three without a view - the kind you won't see in the ads I stayed in Hong Kong Metropark Hotel (Causeway Bay) for 10 days. It was one of those air-line tickets plus 3 days hotel stay deals. I paid for the rest of the 7 days ($95 US dollar/day). The hotel gave me a room with 2 small double beds (I have 3 people. My wife and I and my 14 years old kid).The room is the smallest, in comparison with other hotels I had stayed before. I visit Hong Kong every two or three years and I have stayed in YMCA (Kowloon), Marco Polo (Kowloon) and Park Lane Hotel (Kowloon) before. The beds are small and just enough to fit one person comfortably. My biggest complaint is about the so-called smoke-free floor. I am very sensitive to cigerette smoking. As such, I am especially picky in ensuring my hotel room is smoke-free. Again, this hotel is the worst (in comparision with others) in terms of non-smoking room. We can smell cigerette smoke from the air conditioning in our rooms. The complaint to the front desk was of no-avail. I guess the hotel is not very strict in enforcing the law. Someone next door might be violating the no-smoking rule. At the very least, the hotel should put up warning signs (with the eye-catching words: $5000 fine) like those displayed in public non-smoking areas.The last but not least is the problem of Taxis drivers failing to find the hotel. Taxis drivers, especially those coming from the Kowloon side simply don't know how to get us to the front door of the hotel. About 50% of the time, they drove us to as close as they could and we have to walk a few blocks (not to mention, we are carrying all our shopping bags and the heavy rain was pouring...) to got back to the hotel. The location of the Hotel is simply too remote.The only good remarks I can give to this hotel is to its staff. They are friendly and respectful at all times.

<Content>check-in service wasn't great, but got a fab free upgrade! My husband and I booked a Harbourview standard room (Double room, non-smoking) through Wired Destinations website for a promo rate of S$130 per night. Upon check-in, i asked how much it would cost to upgrade to parlour room -- HK$500, or almost double my room's cost, so we didn't bother. Then the check-in guy realised that they ran out of Harbourview standard rooms and grudgingly offered us a free upgrade, which of course made our day. Unfortunately, he said we could either have a) non smoking room with two single beds, or b) double but smoking room. Since i'm there on a second honeymoon with my husband and i'm asthmatic (no smoking rooms!), both options were no good for us. I explained nicely to the check-in guy that i had requested a non-smoking room because I'm asthmatic, but he insisted that there was no such request and even acted as if he was accommodating a last-minute and unreasonable request. Only when I showed him the confirmation slip I'd printed out (lesson learnt: ALWAYS print out the slip for verification) did he say, Oh, travel agent made a mistake, they did not inform us, which i think was rubbish since the request was in black and white. Then miraculously, he managed to get me both a double AND non-smoking room! When i entered the room, i realised why he had been hanging onto it instead of giving it to me right from the beginning. It's a gorgeous 21st-storey parlour room with a bedroom and a living room, 2 TVs (both showing cable), two bathrooms, one long bath and a wonderful shower perfect for a massage-shower after a long day out shopping. The bed faced the harbour and kowloon, it was the most gorgeous view ever and we slept with the curtains pulled back so we could wake up to the view every morning. Other than that little confusion at check-in, we had a fabulous four-night stay at Metropark. They let us use the pool after we checked out, and we took a shower before we left for the airport early evening. Great way to freshen up. The little pub had a karaoke session the night we popped by for our complimentary drinks. Hilarious to watch middle-aged men warble terribly and worse, dance. Food Tips:1. we stumbled upon a fantastic chinese restaurant in In Square (i think) at Causeway Bay. Anyhow, it's the shopping mall opposite HMV and in fact, used to house HMV. Also has Toys R Us and a cinema in the building and it's very near to Beverly island shopping mall, you can't miss it. The restaurant is on 14th floor and the dim sum is super cheap before 4pm, on weekdays, starting from HK$6 per dish! We paid HK140 for a huge and very good lunch including roasted pigeon.2. If you're visiting Lamma island, don't eat at Man Fung, the first seafood restaurant after you pass the ferry terminal. For three dishes (steamed fish, fried crab and a mixed toufu  seafood hotpot), it cost us HK$620+. the food was not fantastic, although of course it was very fresh. i think you can get better deals if you walk further down the village.We also trekked half an hour to Han Lok Yuen which supposedly served one of HK's best roasted pigeon. Very hard to find, but food was okay. incidentally, i didn't think their pigeon HK$55 was better than the one i had in the chinese dim sum restaurant HK$22.

<Content>Very accommodating We landed in Hong Kong after a 15 hour overnight flight. It was 7am. The Metropark let us check in right then. We took a dip in the fabulous rooftop pool and relaxed in the sauna. (Although the sauna is quite small in the ladies locker room). The rooftop pool is really spectacular - nothing like floating on your back and watching the HK skyline! However, the hot tub/small pool was not hot at all. I'm not sure why. It would have been a nice touch.The staff at the hotel are really helpful. We needed some brief translation for our tailor, and they seemed happy to be of service. The rooms are a bit small - but I suspect that is more typical of a cramped city. The furnishings are nice and new. The location is really great - so close to the subway line.

<Content>Tiny room, but good location We have just returned from the Metropark hotel. We found the hotel decidedly average, the room was titchy, and after our 3 suitcases there was no room to move! The room also smelt of cigarettes even though it was no smoking. On our first morning we had breakfast in the restaurant which was overpriced, we never eat there again! The redeeming feature of the hotel is that it is in a great location, it felt far from the craziness of Kowloon and yet it took us only 15 minutes in total from the hotel to anywhere of interest on the MTR. The only thing else that is good is the cheap price, but you certainly get what you paid for 鈥?expect no luxuries.

<Content>Great Hotel My wife and I arrived at the hotel on a Saturday evening and check-in was made so easy by the hotel staff. My first impressions of the hotel were that the pictures on the website just didn鈥檛 do it any justice. Before even seeing the standard room we upgraded to one of their executive suites for an extra 拢230 for the week. If you have the money, this is well worth it. The upgrade will include an executive lounge for guests wishing to use the Internet, lounge and watch some TV or just take advantage of the free breakfast buffet in the mornings. If possible try to request a corner room as they seem even bigger than the normal executive suites. The executive corner room suites come with the standard bedroom and front room but also 2 bathrooms and a bar.There鈥檚 a 鈥?Eleven鈥?store a few doors down from the hotel which is open 24 hours so you鈥檙e better off buying your own drinks and storing them in the fridge rather than taking them from the mini bar.There鈥檚 also an Indian/ Thai restaurant a few doors down from the hotel. While the staff were very friendly, the service was slow and our meal wasn鈥檛 brought out all at once, (i.e., I received my meal long before my wife鈥檚 arrived.) So it may be worth requesting that everything is brought to you at the same time. But the food is also very overpriced so it may be worth dining elsewhere. The hotel food is fine but beware, after 1am the late night menu may be poor. The menu does offer a selection of food but you may find that in reality, there鈥檒l only be one or two dishes actually available at that time. Vic鈥檚 Bar is also a nice place to hang out with its live music and karaoke鈥?not to mention the happy hour (buy one get one free drinks) from 4pm- 8pm. Also worth seeing are the groups of people who gather in the nearby park to practice Tai Chi every morning. But be warned; they often start from as early as 6am so if you鈥檙e not an early-bird, you鈥檇 better set your alarm if you want to catch them!The hotel provides a shuttle bus service that will take you to a number of popular destinations. Officially, the bus runs every half an hour. But (we could only assume) that the drivers weren鈥檛 keen to make the trips as we were told several times to come back in half an hour as that would be when the bus was running. After insisting that we wanted to be taken immediately, the staff were more than happy to put us on a bus! So it may be necessary to let staff know in advance what bus you鈥檇 like to catch鈥?and be persistent if necessary.That said, Tin Hau train station is right around the corner from the hotel and the train system is very straightforward, so this is a very reliable mode of transport.Very lovely hotel鈥?would definitely stay there again

<Content>Loved this hotel...our little base while in Hong Kong!!! We stayed at the Metropark for 3 nights - March 9th through 12th. When we first arrived there from the airport it seemed a little out of the way and seemed to be in a semi-residential area. I was very wrong! Less than a 5 minute walk away is an MTR station (their subway) which can take you anywhere you want to go. Central is I think only 2 stops away. Everything was so convenient to get to!!As other posts mentioned, great grocery store (a real grocery store) just around the corner which added great savings for snacks and drinks!Rooms were clean and modern but incredibly small. Our view was that of a gazilion other apartment buildings but I was fine with that. Our room had a shower only and two tiny twin beds. Still it suited our needs we were hardly there anyways.Breakfast was excellent (as all Asian hotels seem to do) - Chinese, Japanese, American - it's all there.The pool on the top floor was open but I did not swim in it. Even if you don't swim or work out (also on the top floor - some free weights and about 5 pieces of cardio equipment with mirrored walls) you should go to the top floor for the wonderful views it has!I would definitely stay here again if/when I return to Hong Kong. It felt homey (and that's a good thing), staff were great (doormen running to push open the door for you every single time) the room was fine and we zipped all over Hong Kong.Oh....and the best part....Ethernet Internet Access in the room is free! (You have to supply your own computer)...I believe there is Internet Access in the Business Centre as well.! (I also had about 20 wireless networks come up on my laptop but stuck with the hotels access)

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed for 4 nights in the Metropark in December 05. It is a lovely modern hotel with very helpful staff and although not right in the centre of things there is an MTR station about 3-4 minsutes walk from the hotel that will take you anywhere you need to go. I found the room size to be fine for Hong Kong. We had a harbour view that was great. There are a few restuarants nearby and a few bars too, if you want to stay local.

<Content>Very pleasant Stay Can`t fault my stay in this hotel last year, I arrived on an early morning flight from the UK tired and expecting to have to wait for my room until the afternoon but without prompting they offered me an early check in. Also as I had a late departure was able to use the gym facilities to freshen up. Very good location less than a couple of mins walk from the MTR and tram stops and theres a small supermarket just 2 doors down. Free internet access in the rooms if you have a laptop was a real plus.

To get to Metropark from the airport, I would recommend bringing the hotel phone number or telling the taxi that it is in Tin Hau on Tung lo wan Rd to make it easier. The staff was also very helpful in giving directions to tourist areas.

<Content>Excellent Service We were so glad we chose to stay at the Metropark after much deliberation. We stayed for 3 nights in a suite. The room was very large and beautiful with a welcoming fruit platter. The bathroom was also an excellent size and the view over the harbour was magnificent. It was also possible to watch the locals do tai chi in the mornings at Victoria Park. The service was excellent and very friendly. As we stayed in the suite we had a lovely buffet breakfast included as well as all day access to the lounge. The MTR is across the road and it is only a short walk to Causeway Bay.

<Content>A good value hotel on Hong Kong island I was satisfied with the Metropark, a good value clean hotel on Hong Kong island. The room was small but well designed (I believe small rooms are normal in this price range in Hong Kong). The room windows were large. I had a harbour view room and was quite happy with the view: the hotel faces a sports club with tennis courts etc (so no high rises in front of the hotel) and the harbour was at about 2 o'clock. There are tea and coffee making facilities in the room. The bathroom was small (a shower, no bath). The only real complaint I had with my room was that the bed headboard needed replaced, but otherwise the room was in good condition.The breakfast selection is fine but the breakfast room itself is perhaps a bit stark. There is free internet access available in the hotel (3 internet points).There is a small rooftop pool and gym. The pool is open during the summer months but was covered over when I was there (January 2006).The hotel is in a good location for transport: an airport bus stops right outside, the hotel is very close to Tin Hau metro station and a tram line runs very close by.There are some useful shops around the hotel area, small supermarket, pharmacy etc.

<Content>A Pleasant Week at the Metropark We visited Hong Kong for Chinese New Year (our eighth trip to Hong Kong over the last 20 years) and family didn't have room for us so we gave the Metropark hotel a try. The space was beautiful with a lovely view but small. This is Hong Kong after all! Service is excellent and attentive. As they primarily cater to the mainland trade, English takes a backseat to Cantonese and Mandarin among the staff. We will definitely stay there again if the arises. The location is off the beaten track but it allows a traveller to see more of the real Hong Kong than a place in Central or TST.

<Content>Great Choice I stayed at this hotel for three nights with my girlfriend, and recommend this hotel to anyone on holiday in Hong Kong. Excellent price for value, clean, and friendly. The pool is also very nice but small and unheated, with a spectacular vista of the skyline from its rooftop perch. If visiting Hong Kong, The Metropark is not off the beaten track. With the Tin Hau Station a two minute walk from the front door, you are in Hong Kong Central, Admiralty, or Wan Chai in less than 10 minutes. Airport connection is also very easy and efficient.

<Content>Great hotel We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on a stopover on our way to Australia. I booked this hotel after reading the reviews on this forum, and particularly because it was close to the airport bus stop. We arrived at 11am when check-in was not until 2pm. As we were very tired from a long flight we were quite keen to get showered and changed etc before heading out again. After some persistence, we were given a room that we could use just to freshen up until our room became ready. Room size was fine. Staff were friendly and helpful. The location of this hotel is very handy and it is walking distance to many shops and restaurants. There is a great Indian restaurant across the road from the hotel as well. We took an excursion offered by the hotel which was a day tour of Hong Kong - this was fairly priced (compared to others we saw) and convenient. We had a great time and a convenient base for sight seeing. I would stay here again.

<Content>small rooms As we intended staying for five nights we were disappointed to be allocated a very small room with no view [other than a highrise tenement block]. We requested an upgrade and oh boy was it worth it! We moved to a suite with a separate sittingroom and huge windows with fabulous views of the city.It cost us more but it elevated our stay to a different level completely. The rooftop pool was lovely and was a great way to finish the night - a jacuzzi and cocktail - bliss!

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Metropark at the start of a 3 week holiday. We spent 4 days in Hong Kong and you can read the report on the discussion page. It is a great hotel. The location is great and the MTR is so easy to use you can get everwhere within a few mintues. The staff were all friendly and the rooms were kept very clean. We actually stayed in a parlour room and got a very large room with two bathrooms and a view to die for!! You also get complimentary breakfast, papers and evening drink on the 29th floor (again, superb views). It is definately worth the extra.The rooftop pool has great views, as does the gym (if you can be bothered with that kind of thing on holiday). We also like Vic's bar on the 1st floor and the unusual Karaoke that went on, like nothing we've seen before in England, enteraining all the same.We would recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>Great Value - But Off the Beaten Path Great value: very clean, very organized, and very comfortable. However, Causeway is somewhat off the beaten path, and hence the lower price. Essentially, you're getting the same quality as in Central or Wan Chai, but paying less for being 3 stops away on the metro (the MTR stop is very close by, however). Also, if you need western amenities (i.e., Starbucks, a pub, or western breakfast), you won't find it immediately nearby.

<Content>For what it is - very good This hotel is excellently located near the MTR, bus and tram lines. The view from the roof top pool is spectacular - I would imagine the views from the upper floor harbour view rooms are great too.The rooms and bathrooms are a good size, comfortable and well stocked. The main reason you would stay at this hotel is it is a decent hotel in an excellent location.

<Content>What a pleasanr surprise! My wife and I stayed here from 2 - 5 November 2005. To be frank, we were a little concerned that, when we changed from the recommended hotel in Kowloon to the Metropark in Hong Kong at the end of our tour of China, it was actually cheaper. We couldn't have been more pleased with the outcome.Rooms are not large by other than Hong Kong standards, but they are well designed, clean and comfortable. The views over Victoria Park to the Peak, harbour and the skyscrapers of the Island and Kowloon are spectacular. That goes double for the views from the rooftop swimming pool on the 33rd floor.Staff are very pleasant and responsive and the food in the restaurant is good value - particularly the lunchtime buffet at senior citizen prices. The hotel is also very covenient for MTR, buses and trams to explore the Island.We will make a point of staying there again on our next trip.

<Content>MetroPark hotel is A OK! I stayed at metropark hotel one year after it opened up (it first opened in 2001). I took the metro right from the airport to the hotel, you have to transfer once. It's about a 3 minute walk to the hotel. when i got there, the hotel inside is beautiful. I was checked in fast and went up to my room on the 29th floor. The room is very clean, very attractive and nice. the bed has a white goose down comforter(which i never seen in a hotel befor). The bathroom was clean and has a roomy shower. I didn't find the room cramped, but it is a lil' smaller then the rooms in the USA. Very nice staff. I'm a college student and went by was by myself at the time. When I went to go to book a tour at the tour office, the lady rep invited me to have dinner with her at the hotel for no charge. Very nice hotel, on of the best service I ever had at a hotel. Very easy to get around the city, since it very close to the metro station and bus stations. The pool is on the roof, very nice pool and very nice view. Seven Eleven is 3 stores away, super market is close too. i sugest you go there instead of using the mini bar at the hotel since that is a lil' bit pricey. Breakfast was very good! overall I Loved It. Would stay there again if i ever go back to hong kong.

<Content>A week at the Metropark My wife and I have just returned from a week in Hong Kong staying at the Metropark Hotel at Tin Hau (near Causeway Bay). We arrived early at the hotel on the first day of our holiday hopeful that the hotel would have a room available for us a little earlier than the advertised check-in time. Unfortunately, our room was not quite ready but the staff at the hotel were happy for us to use the change facilties attached to the top floor gym (with nearby pool that has sensational views towards the harbour) and to store our luggage until our room was available. We took them up on their offer and when we returned a few hours later our room was available. Our deal included a double, non-smoking room with harbour views. Unfortunately, the room provided was not what we requested and a couple of moves later they were able to meet our original request.After this slight hiccup where we were able to get to know the hotel porters quite well as we travelled between rooms and also got to see several of the hotel's floors we were quite impressed with the overall cleaniness, standard of service and friendliness of the staff.The hotel's lifts (as advised by other guests of this hotel on this site) were at times quite slow, but this was outweighed by the hotel's close proximity to transport; the MTR (Tin Hau) station and trams were across the road, nearby supermarket and green space in the form of parkland, jogging track, pool and tennis courts. One of the more memorable sights was to watch the locals engaging in the morning ritual of Tai Chi.This hotel represented pretty good value for money and enabled us to be centrally located whilst not being entirely immersed in the bustle associated with downtown areas.I would recommend the hotel to people planning a trip to Hong Kong that were looking for value for money in respect to those features mentioned above.

<Content>Wonderful suite We had wonderful time staying in Metropark Hotel. Very nice location, only 2 mins walk to TinHou subway station. Highly recommend the suite. ask for the room with west facing harbour view, fantastic. Very nice bathroom. Friendly stuff. Only the rooftop swimming pool is sorta on the small size, but the view made up for it. we also get the excellent rates on the suite. However, if you are a single visitor primarily interested in bar hopping then stay close to centre.

<Content>Highly recommend the Parlour Suite We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Metropark. After reading lots of hotel reviews about small rooms we choose to treat ourselves to the Parlour Suite and we have been spoilt. The room is very large with a sitting area and a beautiful view of the harbour. The bathroom is also large and includes a bath and shower. We received complimentary buffet breakfast daily, internet use, daily newspaper, tea  coffee and at all times excellent service. Highly recommend the Parlour Suite.

The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel was extremely clean.The rooms were quite small but very nicely furnished. The only problems we had were that we had asked for a double room and were given a twin room and the air conditioning didnt work very well.The restaurant served good meals and a hearty breakfast.Great location just across the road from the MTR underground.I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>No hesitation in recommending this hotel. This is a classy good four star hotel. The rooms are small, for a four star hotel. However, they are in very good condition, with good views onto Victoria Park and Hong Kong Harbour. The rooftop pool  spa is lovely, and worth a visit. The food  service of their buffet restaurant is of a very high standard. The hotel is just outside the tourist/shopping area of Hong Kong Island (do you really, really want to be in the middle of the shops  noise anyway?). However, it is only a 30 second walk to the closest tram stop, and a 1 minute walk to the Island Line train line. When I return to Hong Kong, I will definetely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Good location The location of the hotel is very convenient for travelling by MTR, bus, tram and taxi. It is also not far from the main Causeway Bay shopping area.Couple of supermarkets  hot bread shops nearby.The TV need a bit of patience to learn  operate.Bath room only has shower facility, no bath tub.Power point has no on off switch.The standard room is rather small  looking at apartment across the road. The room is rather dark  I had to go into the toilet to read my paper.The karaoke bar downstairs is loud but won't affect people upstairs.If you are security conscious be aware anyone from the street can walk in and go upstairs without requiring a key to operate the lift.As mentioned by other people the view on the roof top swimming pool is lovely - however it is not for the faint hearted or people who are scare of height. Do not stand too close to the edge !!!

<Content>Good hotel, good location Stayed here for a few on nights on way to Sydney in November 04. Like a lot of other reviewers, i thought the room was small but in a place like Hong Kong you shouldn't be spending too much time there. Staff were friendly and helpful and some good info from the tourist desk. About 10 minutes walk from the busy streets of Causeway Bay, but 30 seconds from the MTR station and trams which are cheap and reliable (buy an Octupus card at the airport!).Tremendous, mainly unrestricted views over Hong Kong, harbour and Kowloon from the rooftop pool. Restaraunt a bit pricey, but reasonable value European/Asian buffet breakfast. No problems at night with karoke - although Bridge Over Troubled Water in Cantonese is interesting.

<Content>nice hotel, but nothing that makes it stand out This hotel was fine, but you can't really say anyhting that makes it stand out above any other run-of-the-mill hotel. The main thing about most hotels in Honkers is that you are only in them to sleep, so if you are out and about people who spend most of the time wandering around the night markets or going sight seeing then the metropark is fine, If though you spend a lot of time in your hotel then you may find it slightly lacking. The karaoke though was probably the funniest thing I have ever seen, lots of japanese businessmen singing danny boy, I am still laughing at it now. It deserves its 3 1/2* rating it probably should be 4 star in fairness

<Content>Great hotel in fabulous Hong Kong We've just come back from Hong Kong  stayed at the Metropark for a few nights on our way to  from Sydney. We were more than pleased with the hotel - Yes the rooms are on the smaller side (tho no worse than in Italy) but there is still more than enough room  lets face it, when you are in HK, the amount of time that you'll be spending in your hotel room will / should be minimal! The staff were great  nothing was too much trouble. The rooms themselves are so clean  tastefully decorated - we really couldn't fault it for the money (拢30 per room per night excl b'fast for harbour view room)We didn't go for breakfast (it was around 拢10) as there is so much on offer everywhere you go in HK. The view from our room as well as the gym  pool areas on the top floor were stunning also. There is a lively karaoke bar on the first floor, which I'd imagine could be a problem if you are on one of the very low floors so I'd specify an upper floor when booking. All in all, we enjoyed it immensely  would highly recommend the Metropark  HK.
