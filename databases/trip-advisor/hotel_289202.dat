<Content>Lovely hotel, convenient location in Venice We enjoyed staying for 2 nights at the Antiche Figure in Venice last month. Upon arriving we were offered to move to suites (we had 2 rooms booked) at the 'annex' location down the small street next to the hotel. The rooms were well decorated with many amenities. The suites did appear to be quite a bit larger than the double and triple rooms we were shown in the main hotel. The suites did not have views of the Canal, but that was not a priority for us as we spent most of our time exploring the lovely city of Venice.The location of the hotel is very convenient for arrival and departure from Venice. We were able to walk from the Piazzale Roma after arriving by air, then leave Venice via the train station directly across the canal. The bridge across the canal is somewhat difficult with large luggage to reach the train station. Venice is easy to walk in, we walked to and from St. Mark's square, although the water bus was also available.The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. They were kind to give us restaurant recommendations and show us the nearest church to attend Christmas Eve services. The breakfast room was large, the buffet was nice with meats, cheese, eggs, fresh fruit and a large variety of breads and cereals each day. We would be pleased to stay at this hotel if we are able to return to Venice in the future.

<Content>Wouldn't stay anywhere else! I had read all the great reviews for Antiche Figure before booking with them through Expedia, so it's hard to say something that hasn't already been said. However, I have travelled all over the world and have rarely encountered the degree of friendliness and service that this small hotel provides. The personnel were truly outstanding.  FYI....the Antiche Figure will be opening a Boutique Hotel down the street from their current location later this year. They said that any previous guests or persons who say they received a recommendation from a previous guest will be able to stay at the new hotel during it's first year of operation at the same rates as the original hotel.

<Content>Lovely Hotel with Excellent Service My family of four booked the hotel based on tripadvisor's reviews and we were not disappointed. The service staff was excellent, taking the trouble to explain the finer features of the hotel without our asking. They went out of the way to anticipate our needs.Although they were near the train station, having to clear the bridge across the Grand Canal with heavy luggages made it seemed more distant. However, it was better than having to take a vaporetto or water taxi to get to a hotel.If only they did not recommend the glass foundry visit to a certain Signoretti company, our stay would have been perfect. While the glass foundry visit itself was above board, the sales staff was definitely pushy and the hotel's association certainly tainted their image.

<Content>Best Value For Money Small but perfect in many ways.Nothing beats a 3-Star Hotel with a 5-Star service and accommodation offer! The staff ensure constant personalised  friendly assistance. Your stay here is guaranteed to be comfortable, pleasant and hassle free. Conveniently located within a 5 minute walk from the central bus terminus at Piazzale Roma (the final stop for all vehicles before Venice) and situated directly opposite (across the Grand Canal) the Train Station, you are perfectly set within reach of all major attractions. The Vaporetto (public water bus service) from close to the Train Station here is only 鈧?.50 to Piazza San Marco.The hotel staff will surprise you with their unsurpassed knowledge of current events in the city, cultural or historical exhibtions and more. The rooms are incredibly decorated in the style reminiscent of pure Venetian romance. They are kept constantly preened and spotless by their 'attention to detail' housekeepers. I loved walking in to find a Baci chocolate on my pillow every night and I would let it slowly melt in my mouth while I smiled like the princess I imagined myself to be while gazing out of my window onto the Canale Grande.The breakfast was always fresh with a wide choice of healthy food items to choose from or for those who want to indulge  spoil themselves during their stay, there is always a delectable spread of tarts, fresh crossants and other mouth-watering goodies!I highly recommend the place. It's the best value for money anyone can get around venice....and believe me, the staff's genuine friendly attitude is priceless. I am definitely returning for a personal vacation with my partner and shall mark this hotel as my top choice!Francesca VincentiMalta

<Content>Loved the hotel, loved the service--fantastic location! We stayed in Venice right before the most recent flooding . . .the location from the main bus terminal Piazelle Roma made it really convenient and CHEAP to get to and from the airport on the airport buses. When you land and go to the main baggage area, look for a little window (Information) off to one end of the airport and you can buy the bus passes for the airport bus and waterbuses for however many days you'll be using it. The water buses were very short walk from the hotel, as people have mentioned, --even a gondelier station right outside the hotel door! Pay attention to the directions from the buses, because you want to go over the little green metal bridge (about 40 steps) to walk to the hotel. You'll come right to it then.I booked after looking at the hotel website and checking everything out on Trip Advisor---which was so helpful for planning our trip there and to Vienna. The front desk was very good about emailing all info and confirmations. I even wrote a few days before since I booked the room months in advance; they always replied promptly etc. They genuinely wanted us to have a good stay.The front desk staff was very accommodating---gave us names of places to try for eating, gave us an early morning cappucino and continental breakfast at 5:00a.m. the day we left for an early flight. They offered us a room upgrade for a nominal amount, which was really worth it to be facing the Grand Canale. We were there when it was cold, so the tourists were not there enmasse, loud etc. It was great room . .. great coffeemaker in the room fully stocked with teas and coffee, and fantastic amenities like shampoos, toothbrushes with paste etc. So nice since it's such a pain with the airline restrictions now. Flat screen TV. The hotel has recently been remodeled; it's clean and lots of marble in the bathrooms, nice decor. Even the inside room we looked at was nice, but a good deal cozier (small) than the one we ended up with. Either way, they have nice rooms.The staff couldn't have been kinder and more helpful! (They will make you a nice cappucino in the bar and bring it to the breakfast area if you ask, and then will just charge it to your room. It's lovely, better than the coffee machine, which isn't terrible either) The bar also has some little sweet treats to buy and maybe even some sandwiches; I didn't check. No full restaurant service tho, but a cute little nook in the lobby across from the bar, if you want to enjoy something downstairs, which people did I noticed. The breakfast I thought was very good---quite a big spread of all kinds of baked items, boiled eggs, fruit, cereals, yogurt and so forth. A lovely big breakfast room--enough to handle all the clientele. The staff weren't pushy, either, about getting you out of the breakfast, which was nice since you're on vacation! They arranged the FREE water taxi to Murano (you can take a water bus home) which was really nice, although the taxi takes you to a small, artist gallery glass factory which is pretty pricey--the cheapest thing we saw was 60 Euro, but we did enjoy the little demonstration and looking in the showroom. NO obligation to buy; the hotel staff even mentioned that, but you do have to steel yourself for the sales pitch. The last demonstrations were around 3 or 4:00 in the afternoon, so watch the timing. It's a short walk from there up the hill to the main street and canal where there are plenty of other shops and restaurants. You catch the water bus from there.One thing to watch in the restaurants--especially near San Marks Square. There are two menu prices in many---one for take away items, drinks etc. and another price for sitting down, which can make it considerably more expensive. We were there without the big crowds, which was sooo nice. We enjoyed touring the Basilica and the Doges' Palace--esp. the prisons (very foreboding), but we enjoyed wandering around the streets just as much! Got a lot in because there was no waiting time, but it was chilly and probably felt even colder because you're on the water, so we were glad we had heavy coats and cashmere! Our stay was definitely enhanced because of the Hotel Antiche Figure; I'm so glad we found it online. We did book early and I'd advise that because I'm sure it fills up fast because of the price and the good reviews. We would love to find another hotel like this one if we visit another romantic spot in Italy again. sometime.

<Content>Best Concierge i travel a lot on business and have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world. this time i was traveling as a tourist.I chose this hotel based on the reviews on hotels.com. I was very pleased, its a short walk from the blue airport bus stop, away from the crowded area of san marco. there is a water bus stop right across, and in front of the santa lucia train station, a very convenient location. on top of the convenience, i was most impressed by the staff, mikele, carlo, and francesca and the rest of the antiche figure employees made my stay very comfortable and unforgettable. they were conscientious and overtly accommodating, much better service than in any of the big hotel chains i have stayed at. most people think of venice in the late spring or summer, but people in the know will tell you nothing is quite like venice in the winter.thanks again to the antiche figure staff!

<Content>Best Hotel in Venice! This hotel is amazing. We had a lovely room on the top floor with windows on 2 sides over looking the canal. The staff go out of their way to help you. They booked us a lovely restuarant and a show which we wanted to go to. The rooms are clean and big. The bed is big enough to swim in!The boat stop is on the otherside of the bridge and most numbers stop there, so bery easy to get around and back. We walking to the Rialto bridge in 25 mins at a slow pace.I would recommend this hotel to everyone. Noramlly I would give good and bad points to the hotel but this one really has none. There is no restuarant in the hotel, but your in venice and there are resturants everywhere. If you stay here I hope you have as good as time as we did. I will be going back here soon.

<Content>Amazing - really top class The Antiche Figure couldn't have made us feel any more welcome, any happier or any more valued than they did. Service was routinely pleasant and helpful - we emailed before arrival asking a couple of things and go helpful responses. Ours was a Christmas stay and they made the whole thing brilliant. So OK the rooms are a little smaller than one might expect - but this is Venice, this faces the Grand Canal, it's beautiful and the staff are genuine.Can't fault it - stay there again for definite if we're ever back in Venice.

<Content>Great Hotel My wife and I stayed for one night in the Antiche Figure and booked the Grand Canal overlook room. It was very charming, quiet, and the staff were extremely friendly. We loved the views from the windows in our room. Also, the bed was exceptionally soft and comfortable, something you dont find much in Europe.Price was comparable to everything else in Venice: very expensive.

<Content>Excellent choice We chose this hotel based on reviews here and on its location across from the train and vaporetto station. So glad we did. When we arrived we had no trouble crossing the bridge and finding our hotel which was right there on the Grand Canal. (Still perplexed at how one would drag luggage on the vaporetto or worse, walk through the winding streets of Venice, if one's hotel was some distance from the train station.) The staff was amazingly helpful, knowledgeable and patient and all spoke very good English. The room was very clean, though on the small side, quite luxurious and had a wonderful view of the canal. We could walk everywhere though it was quite a long walk to St Mark's. Highly recommended, though if you are looking for a very quiet location, this may be a little busy for you but we loved the convenience of the vaporetto station just across the bridge.

<Content>A Lovely Place and Perfect Location After returning from our cruise in the Greek islands, we had just a few nights to see Venice. Hotel Antique Figure was the perfect location. We walked from the ship to the hotel and when we left to return to the states we walked to the station to catch the bus to Marco Polo airport. The hotel was lovely. The room was beautiful over looking the Grande Canal with a large spacious marble bathroom. But better than the accomodations and breakfast was the personal service we were given. Everyone was kind and helpful with plenty of advice and suggestions for where to go, and how to get there, from restaurants to tourist attractions. We had a wonderful experience and would recommend this hotel to all our friends!  Max and Cynthia Pennsylvania, USA

<Content>Glorious Hotel What a glorious hotel!! My new wife and I had been to Italy on our honeymoon. We had just come from Milan where we had a disappointing hotel stay (I booked without consulting Trip Advisor). Furthermore, I had heard rooms (and particularly bathrooms) in Venice were tiny. So my expectations were lowered.When we arrived at the Venice train station, we took a short walk over a nearby bridge and viola, the hotel was just a few doors down right on the Grand Canal. Francesca greated us with warmth and ebulience (noting that it was our honeymoon). The lobby/bar area was charming and cozy. She personally escorted us to our room (312). It was beautiful and surpringly spacious. The was a desk, a separate sitting area with a table and two chairs. The bathroom was also spacious and nicely appointed with murano (sp?) style glass fixtures. Everything was also spotless! The bed was large and comfortable. There was a tasteful work of art, and the room had a very elegant, gilded element to it. But the best part was the windows. Another reviewer noted that he did not think a deluxe view room was worth the extra money unless it was on the second floor, which have small balconies. While I would agree balconies are even better, I would respectfully disagree. We had a nearly panoramic view of the activities all along the upper part of the Grand Canal. It is true that the hotel does face the main train station, and the bus station is visable. But it was easy for me to let my eyes wander down at the canal level, I loved the sights and sounds of the waterway. However, once we clossed the windows we were pleased to discover the soundproofingwas quite satisfactory; we slept well at night, It was a deluxe room, and came with a supply of complimentary coffee and teas. Internet is free of charge in the rooms. When we mentioned that we had a laptop, but no connecting cable, she had one brought up for us to use. There was a nice coninental brekfast every morning that I would recommend for 7 Euros. Since anywhere in Venice is theoretically no more than about a 30 minute walk, or a comparable vaparotto (water bus) ride, its location works quite well. The front desk, whether it be Francesca or the very helpful and humorous man whose name I cannot recall that splits time with her, is alway there to help with a restaurant recommendation or a suggestion about what to do.Overall a complete treat to stay there!

<Content>Back in Venice at the Hotel Antiche Figure We stayed at this hotel just after it was opened in 2003,the first time,and loved the location, staff and aminities. We booked acruise that began in Venice last Novemeber and took the opportunity to stay at the Antiche Figure again. Once again we had a wonderful stay. It is an easy walk to the cruise ship buses or taxi stand from the hotel. If we ever have the opportunity to return to Venice this will be our hotel of choice.

<Content>Outstanding We stayed here for 3 nights back in May. We chose this hotel due to the previous reviews and it more than lived up to its fabulous expectations. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly especially when I put in more than a few requests for 'the best local restaurants' and flowers to be delivered on the Friday morning for my partners 30th birthday. They arrived within 15 mins - perfect service.The room and location were excellent and we had the perfect 3 days with my partner saying yes to my marriage proposal. Don't stay anywhere else in Venice.

<Content>Perfect Location After a quick five minute walk from the train station (across a bridge), we were greeted at the Hotel Antiche Figure by a warm and wonderful lady named Francesca. She immediately made us feel right at home and gave us all the necessary information about the vaparetto(s), food and tours (as well as getting us reservations for a Vivaldi concert). If your staying for more than 2 days, by all means buy a vaparetto pass, great savings. We had a beautiful room with a small balcony overlooking the Grand Canal. Francesca recommended a great place to eat (Auntica Bessica (sp?), and the sea bass was amazing. Continental breakfeast was good each morning as was the service. Venice is expensive (more than Rome and Positano) but again, if your into Prada, Armani, Ferregamo or Louis Vitton your'll be at Heaven's gate!! All in all a great time, and we thank Francesca and the rest of the front desk staff for their kindness and sincere attentiveness to make our stay a truly memorable experience.

<Content>High marks for the Antiche Figure We enjoyed our stay here very much. Our room was not large but was well appointed. The hotel is conveniently located directly across the Grand Canal from the rail station and a water bus stop. They serve a nice breakfast in the morning (for an extra charge), and the staff was wonderful - friendly, professional, and very helpful. I can recommend this hotel to anyone who does not feel they have to be in the expensive St. Mark's square area.

<Content>The Best Hotel I do not normally write reviews about the hotels we stay in but the Hotel Antiche Figure was so good I just had to let everyone know.We arrived at the end of extended European holiday to spend our last night in Venice at the Antiche Figure. After 6 weeks of hotels we thought this would just be the same as the rest. Fortunately we soon found out this was not the case. The staff were absolutely wonderful, their service was excellent and most importantly they made you feel as if we were at home.Our room was a deluxe room overlooking the grand canal, it was a blue room and was beautifully furnished. We loved some of the little things that our room had, such as the coffee and tea facilities in the room, something very rare in Italian hotel rooms. The bathroom was a generous size with more than usual amenities and of course it was fitted with beautiful marble and murano glass lighting. Everything about the hotel was perfect. Next time we go to Venice the Hotel Antiches Figure is definitely the place for us to stay. By the way our room number was 311.

<Content>A Perfect Stay at the Perfect Hotel We booked the Antiche Figure as a result of the reviews in TripAdvisor, and we were not disappointed! We were in Venice for a few days before leaving on a cruise on the Zuiderdam.We arrived on September 27 after flying from NY through Madrid, taking the 3 Euro blue bus from the airport to Piazzale Roma (the only place in Venice that vehicles are allowed). The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from Piazzale Roma (it would have been five minutes as they suggest, but we were each pulling two large wheeled suitcases up and over the two bridges which were a bit challenging).When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the manager, who offered us a choice of two rooms - and insisted that we go up and choose. The rooms are beautiful (even though we had one the lower cost red rooms) and the bath was marble with a wonderful shower.Once up and the room chosen, our bags arrived in about two minutes. We then went down (it was 2:30pm) and asked the manager if there was anywhere in the area to grab a quick lunch. He directed us down an alley next to the hotel to a series of small shops including a bakery and pizzeria.Having eaten, we returned and asked if there was a short walk we could take before we started thinking about dinner. He pulled out a map, told us how to get Vaporetto (water bus) tickets (a 3-day pass), and mapped out a route for us to San Marcos via water and then a walk back. It seemed aggeressive, but it was perfect! By the way, you can pretty much throw your map away in Venice. Despite what you read, you are never really lost. You see yellow signs everywhere for San Marcos, Rialto, Piazzala Roma, and Ferrovia (train station). Since the Antiche Figure is near both the train station and Piazzala Roma, just follow the signs until you get to the Grand Canal!The staff sent us to Osteria al Veccio Pozzo for dinner, a simple restaurant where we got the simple light meal we needed before crashing.The next morning, we went to the Antiche Figure's breakfast room where we found just about anything you'd want - from delightful pastries to cereal to juice, to meats and cheeses, boiled eggs, etc. The hostess was consistent with the rest of the staff - going overboard to be helpful - everyone was even asked whether they wanted cappuccino!Back for more advice from the staff, and then a day's run around the city. Their recommendation for dinner was Trattoria Antica Bessetta, where we eventually resorted to a map - it's not easy to find! But was it worth the effort! We met the owner, who told us about a trip that morning to the Venice Pescheria (open air fish market near the Rialto) where he found the perfect turbot, which we ordered. He brought it to the table in the foil in which is was baked, and then worked like an artist to prepare the perfect presentation on our plates. This place is well worth a visit, but make reservations. It was fully booked when we left....Another restful night at the Antiche Figure, followed by check out and detailed directions on how to find the free shuttle bus that runs between the Piazzale Roma and the pier (we had previously contacted Holland America Line and they told us that there was no such bus) which was right where the staff told us it would be.Visiting the Antiche Figure is like going home, even though it may be your first visit. The staff makes you feel like family, and they have practiced their art well. We spoke to others who had stayed at other hotels - even one in famous Bauer for more than twice the money - and none could rave about the hotel, its staff and service, as we could.If you're going to Venice, do yourself a favor. Stay at the Antiche Figure - you won't be disappointed!

<Content>I wanted to stay longer! I booked the Deluxe room at the Hotel Antiche Figure in Venice by going through their web site. The web site itself was well done, but I couldn't have been more pleased than I was when I actually checked in. Our room was right on the Grand Canal with beautiful views in both directions. The hotel staff was awesome! We felt at home here and I really wished I had booked more time to stay in Venice. It was so easy to get around and our hotel hosts, Francesca and Allejandro (sorry if I misspelled your names) were extremely helpful with tips about what to do. You can bet we'll come back here and I'll ask to stay with them again!

<Content>Great place to stay We have just returned from a trip to Venice and stayed in the Antiche Figure. It was excellent. It is ideally placed as it is opposite the railway station with a water bus stop close by. The room was delightful, beautifully furnished and welcoming and the bathroom was wonderful - complete with candelabra! The staff were so good - giving us a map and directions to the best places to see and how to get there. They even stored our bags for nothing when we had a late train journey out - a great change when everyone charges you for everything! It was so quiet and peaceful, yet everything to see with the water on your doorstep. Highly recommended.

<Content>Lovely place, great location Really lovely little hotel opposite the station on the Grand Canal. Our room didn't really have a view (an alley way) but it was clean, extremely comfortable and very Venetian - marble and murano glass. We checked in very late due to flight problems so maybe if we'd been there earlier in the day we might have had more of a view. But can't complain. It was a really nice room. And it sounds like a odd thing to commend a hotel on, but the air conditioning was great - quiet and efficient. A night's sleep in a what would otherwise be a good hotel is so often ruined by the whirring and whining of bad air con. And good double glazing too - Venice is a noisy place. We slept so well there. Well done to the maintenance staff. The staff are what made the stay. All of them are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is continental buffet and plenty of choice. You can have breakfast in the dining room or outside the hotel by the canal. And a night cap from the bar sitting at the tables outside the hotel watching the vaporettos and gondolas go by is an extremely pleasant way to end the day. The hotel is very handy for transport too. We really enjoyed our stay there and will definitely go back next time we're in Venice.

<Content>Wonderful experience I stayed here 9/13-16 with 2 girlfriends. We reserved 2 rooms. When we arrived on a cold, rainy day, we found that they had only one room for us and had not seen the 2nd request for a room. However, they accomodated us by giving us a large triple room with a view of the Grande Canal. The staff was right up there to set up the room. The next day, they gave my friend her room one floor up and they let me and my other friend stay in the triple for a great price (remember the room had an awesome view!) They were very apologetic about the whole mistake. The managers were very helpful and if you called down to request help ie) with bags, they would be up in 60 seconds flat. No joke!! The breakfast was adequate. The room and bathroom was spacious and beautifully decorated. I liked standing on the small balcony and watching boat traffic on the canal. It was a little far from San Marco but there is a vaporetto nearby. I preferred walking so this wasn't a big deal to me. It is right across the canal from the train station. On a side note, ladies, some of the male staff here are VERY easy on the eyes ; ) Overall, the experience here at this hotel and the city in general was wonderful!

<Content>Very Disappointing As everyone has said, the hotel is in a good location. However, I felt that the room that we had was very over priced for a three star hotel. This was supposed to be one of their top rooms facing the Grand Canel. The room was fairly clean but the carpet was terribly faded with a good number of spots all over it. There was also some confusion whether or not our breakfast was included in our rate. If I were to visit Venice again, I'd stay somewhere else.

<Content>Brilliant hotel, great location, fantastic staff This is a lovely smaller hotel situated in a great location. Access from Marco Polo Airport is around 3 euro per person by direct bus to Piazzale Roma just a few hundred metres away while the hotel itself is directly opposite the train station. Position is on the Grand Canal with most of the sites a pleasant walk away or of course a water boat ride. Lots of restaurants in the area so you have a great choice but of course Venice is not somewhere you come for the variety and quality of its cuisine, pizza is its staple dish. On arrival at the hotel we were welcomed by the most pleasant and enthusiastic staff I have ever encountered. We were offered an update to their newly opened suites for surcharge but no pressure to take the deal. We visited our pre booked room which was lovely but the suites were really special and suited our needs better so we took the offer. The suites have a lounge with kitchen area, double bedroom and top quality bathroom, well worth the extra. Our time in Venice was terrific, Venice is a lovely quiet and safe city due to the total lack of motor vehicles, you really discover what we have lost when you can walk around smelling the air not fumes, hearing the sounds of peoples not Lorries and can turn a corner without fear of being flattened. Breakfast at the hotel was a good quality continental and again the staff were wonderful, full of smiles and welcomes. This is a wonderfully convenient hotel which is maintained in excellent condition and is staffed by highly trained and pleasant people, what more could you want?

<Content>Welcoming and friendly The Antiche Figure has a lovely setting overlooking the Grand Canal and extremely close to Ferrovia waterbus stop. Continental Breakfast choices are fine and the accompanying Cappucino's finish it off nicely. All the staff go out of there way to assist and are really helpful with directions and advice. Nothing is too much trouble. Rooms are clean and well furnished. The free water taxi to and from the Casino, with free entry tickets from the hotel including a free drink, provided an exciting evening's entertainment.

<Content>Nice little hotel The staff was extremely friendly. There is a computer to use with internet access of course. The hotel is conveniently located on the opposite side of the train station, across the bridge. Mind you though that there are 40 steps up the bridge and another 40 steps down, which means you want to travel light as you have to carry your luggage across the bridge.The room has been renovated and the bathroom is very clean and tidy.The fresh cappucino at breakfast is a nice touch.I would strongly recommend this hotel.

<Content>First Class Hotel What can we say about this hotel.We stayed a full week in room 412 top floor with three windows overlooking the Grand Canal. This is a small hotel with a great family atmosphere.Nothing is to much trouble. The hotel offer a free trip to a Glass factory via water taxi on Murano, wonderful experience.We spent a long time looking at TA to find the hotel in vencie for our first visit, Hotel Antiche Fugure will not dissappoint you.The hotel is on the Grand Canal, 5 minutes walk from the bus terminal and the train station.Gandola trips go from outside the front door as do water taxis.The Hotel organised a gondola trip for us at night, it was fantastic.If you go to Venice book this Hotel.On a general note ,when you arrive go and buy a 1,2 or 3 day pass from ATVC to travel around on the public transport system including the vaporetto boats.Linda and Roger, West Midlands UK

<Content>Nice 3 star hotel Very clean hotel and very helpful staff. Very enjoyable to sip a glass of wine on the outside patio with the Grand Canal in front of you. We booked a room on the low end of the hotel's price scale. It was very adequate (as I said it was very clean, and that's really important to me, esp. in a foreign country!). The room was probably a bit larger than the std. European room size, but small by American standards. Overall, the room was decent enough but nothing to 'write home about'. Given the high prices in Venice, the rooms are competitively priced, but compared to elsewhere are a bit high.

<Content>family like atmosphere I stayed at this hotel at the beginnig of august for four nights.All the personnel of this hotel that i met during my stay were friendly and get out of their way to make my stay like if i was a family member. They were always smiling. The location of the hotel is convenient.It is near the train station(right on the other side of the grand canal) and near the bus terminus (5 minutes walk with luggages on the same side of the canal as the hotel).It is lively but not crowdy.The room i had was cleanand comfortable.It was not a tiny room.Their was space to move around.Naturally it was not the equivalent of the north american standard as floor space goes but it beat largely a New york city standard hotel room.The breakfast room was inviting and the breakfast good.I loved to sit outside facing the Grand canal in the early morning as the city started to unfold a new day.I felt welcome and i would likely stay there again if im back in Venice one day

<Content>Great hotel, Great location Very nice hotel on other side of grand canal from train station. Follow signs to Ferrovia to get back to the hotel from other parts of Venice. Hotel is located in less touristy area but in close proximity to all sights and transportation. Great service by staff (checking in/breakfast/maid). We upgraded room to Residence Suite which was a newly renovated building with the entrance in the alley next to the hotel. Room was beautiful! It was large and bathroom had massage shower. It felt like our own apartment in Venice. Breakfast buffet was in main hotel, with tables inside and outside overlooking grand canal. Different rolls, cheese, meats, cereal and fruit, but no American breakfast. Complimentary boatride and factory tour of murano glass at Murano Island. Definitely worth going.

<Author>Alphaville1976
<Content>our stay at Antiche Figure was excellent ... My wife and I spent our honeymoon in Italy recently: 5 nights in Rome, 3 in Florence, and 2 in Venice. I heard about Antiche Figure through the reviews here on TripAdvisor, and I decided to book a room for two nights based on a combination of the positive reviews and it's location on the Grand Canal.Just a few comments about it's location: it is a 20 minute walk or so from St. Mark's Square, so this is something for people to consider. I actually like this aspect of the hotel ... my wife and discovered so many interesting streets on our way to the main square. One of the streets was somewhat hidden from the main tourist areas (we found it after visiting Murano), but it contained one of the best restaurants we've ever been to (ex. my wife's dish was squid braised in ink). So, if you really want to discover Venice by walking, I would highly recommend this hotel due to it's location. Another thing to consider is that you can reach this hotel via the local boat system (which is akin to say, Rome's bus system). In fact, it was really fun to visit San Georgio (an island near main Venice) and then take the boat back to our hotel. In the process, we saw some of the other neighboring islands and it really is a nice boat ride. For these reasons, I consider the location to be a plus.Now, for the actual hotel: our room was very nice. It was very clean with a great view of the canal. All of the accomodations were great: comfortable bed, nice bathroom with spacious tub and US-compatible electrical outlet. We didn't get the most expensive room, but I would say that it was a very nice room and definitely very romantic if you are considering this aspect for your trip. We did have the breakfast, and we both felt that this was the best of any of the hotels we visited in Italy. There was a wide assortment of different cereals, coffee products, pastries, meats, and cheeses. A definite plus!Lastly, I would say that the staff was very polite and helpful. We didn't ask too many questions because we like to explore and find things ourselves. Nonetheless, they were always very helpful and willing to suggest things when asked. Overall, a great experence. A very nice hotel with a great location: nice, romantic rooms; great breakfast; and friendly staff.

<Content>Great Hotel, perfect location Excellent hotel with really friendly staff. Great location for Venice - not too close to tourist swamped San Marco but easy to reach all locations in Venice. On Grand Canal with main bus depot nearby, main railway station opposite, waterbus opposite and 5 minute walk from airport waterbus drop off point (as there are no roads, you always have to walk to your hotel!)

<Content>Adorable Hotel with Fantastic Location We selected Hotel Antiche Figure based on others' reviews on Trip Advisor. After a long flight from the US, we took a bus to the Piazzale Roma (main bus stop) and were so relieved to find the hotel just a 5-minute walk away on the canal. The hotel clerk (Johnny, if I recall) was so courteous. He not only accommodated our request for no ground-level rooms, he also upgraded us to a gorgeous suite! The room did not disappoint - beautiful hardwood floors, classic decorations, and the bathroom appeared newly renovated. This hotel really helped make our first trip to Venice an enjoyable, relaxing trip. My one and only opportunity area for this hotel would be its breakfast offering. The breakfast room is quite tight and nothing looked/tasted very appetizing - the cereal was a little stale and the fruit looked bruised.

<Content>I'd go back in a flash A nice little hotel tucked into a busy area of Venice, the Antiche Figure is directly across the Grand Canal from the train station. To get there from the station, simply gross the bridge, turn to the right and it鈥檚 about the equivalent of a city block at most. The bus station to the airport is a short walk beyond the hotel and across a couple of bridges and you can travel to either Marco Polo or Treviso for very little money. With the trains, gondolas, heavy foot traffic and constant coming and going of the vaporetti, you might at first wince at the prospect of a room fronting the canal, however, we spent two nights there and slept like babies.Rooms are smallish but comfortable, with a worn-around-the edges sort of elegance with plenty of closet space, in room safe and fridge, TV, phone, antiqued furniture and silk drapes, and the spacious and elegant baths which seemed to be the standard during our stay in Italy. Personnel is crisply efficient and consistently available. There is an elevator, an ample Continental breakfast of fruits, yogurt, cereal, and pastries or croissants. There is a machine for American coffee and staff will quickly offer you freshly made cappuccino if they spot you in front of the apparatus. Granted the Antiche Figure is a long walk to Piazza San Marco (which can be obviated by traveling via vaporetto) and perhaps it鈥檚 not the most glamorous spot in Venice, but the view is still lovely. Frankly, after the hordes of tourists in Piazza San Marco, I found the area rather an oasis.

<Content>a great place to stay in venice We spent three nights at the hotel, and it was everything we could have hoped for. The room was quiet, well appointed and clean. The breakfast included was more than adequate. The location was very convenient for all of our activities and easily accessible to our arrival point (Piazza Le Roma) which was also the place where we left on a shuttle bus for the marine terminal. Overall a great experience.

<Content>Great hotel  We stayed at the Hotel Antiche Figure just prior to embarking on a cruise from Venice. The hotel is quaint and beautifully maintained. Our room overlooked the Grand Canal. The only detraction was the smaller windows. We were on the top floor and it appears those below have larger windows and hence, a better view. Regardless, we were thoroughly satisfied with the room. The bed was soft, the bathroom exquisite! They furnish robes, slippers, the whole nine yards! A nice buffet breakfast is furnished. A small bar off the lobby provides alcoholic libations as well as cappucinos and cafe Americano. The location is convenient, being right across the canal from the train station and a short walk from the bus terminal. Water taxis are available at the train station and private taxis are also available. It's about a half hour walk to St. Mark's, but it's pleasant with numerous shops to browse around in or small cafes to grab a cappucino. There are a lot of cafes nearby, so going hungry won't be a problem. Overall, I couldn't give a higher recommendation to a hotel. Beware that everything in Venice has to be offloaded and transferred to a boat before delivery, so extra expenses are involved. With the dollar not holding up to the Euro, everything in Venice is expensive. Regardless, it's a city you shouldn't miss and the Hotel Antiche Figure will make it even more rewarding. Ciao!

<Content>Welcome to the family!!! Rarely do you encounter customer service like this.The hotel is so intimate that even though you may only stay there for a couple of nights as we did, the staff know who you are and remember the last conversation they had with you.Not in an overbearing way... just in a way that says they are interested in you, in your stay and in your enjoyment of their city. Of which they are abundantly proud.Our room was beautiful. By way of congratulations for our marrige, we were lucky enough to be given one of the two rooms which home a little C15th balcony, giving us fabulous views of the Grand canal.The rooms are decorated in a typically venetian palatial style... fabric wall coverings, chandeliers etc. Spacious beds which were very comfortable, and so very quiet.Location wise this place was great.. Gondolas outside the hotel doors, Train station on the other side of the Canal, great for onward transfers to Rome or Florence. Water taxi over thebridge. St Mark's square 20 mins walk away. The hotel offers a free water taxi service to Murano island, home of the famous glass, where you can enjoy a free tour of the factory and witness glass blowing etc. well worth visiting.The main bonus was the liitle terrace where you can sit and enjoy breakfast and watch the world go by. brilliant!Lovely family feel, helpful staff, Highly recommended.

<Content>Great Gem of a Hotel- Great Value! For our honeymoon, we had planned a week sailing on the French Riviera, followed by a few nights in Venice.We picked this hotel, based on the great reviews we had read, and we were completly satisfied! Everyone, from the front desk staff to the cleaning service to the dining room and bar staff, was exceptional. From the moment we arrived, they took great efforts to make our trip a great experience. They helped us with suggestions of things to do and places to eat, as well as what to avoid. We had a Grand Canal View room and just loved it. The only thing I would change next time is the lack of a balcony. Our room, while nice, didn't have a balcony and I didn't realize that some rooms had balconies and some didn't. For a honeymoon trip, I would have much preferred having the balcony. Overall, this hotel provides a very good value- it is so close to the train station and the bus stations (both water bus and auto bus). Easy to get anywhere from here- and yet it is a bit out of the most hectic, crowded areas. Very professional and friendly staff. Very helpful! I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again if I returned to Venice. Thank you very much for a very memorable time in Venice!

The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, always with a smile.The Hotel is situated centrally, so you have easy access to all places, and it is decorated to a high standard. We felt comfortable and at home.We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of taking a holiday in Venice and would definitely return here again.Well done.

<Content>A perfect hotel We stayed for the Saturday night after we left the cruise ship Splendour of the Seas. The hotel was just perfect for us and we had a beautiful room at the side of the hotel. It did not matter that we did not have a view as we were only staying the one night and had to leave early the next morning for the airport. We thought the hotel was one of the nicest we had stayed in and the breakfast was fine the next morning. All the staff were very pleasant, helpful and most obliging. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and if we visit Venice again we will stay there.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We stayed at this hotel for two nights to celebrate my birthday, and couldn't have asked for better.We had booked one of the red rooms, but on arrival were informed that one of the suites was available in an adjacent building down a short Calle. We were offered it at a reduced rate of an additional 鈧?0 a night instead of the usual 鈧?0 with breakfast included. Once we had seen the picture, we were hooked and when we saw it, we knew we had made the right choice. It was lovely, and looked very recently done. There was a king size fourposter bed,draped in white muslin. Dressing table, and wardrobe all beautifully decorated. The walls are covered in cream striped fabric, and there are very beautiful wall lights and table lamps. The windows were dressed with acres more white muslin and luxuriously draped curtains. The room was equipped with a security box in the wardrobe and a very efficient mini bar, not to mention the wall mounted flat screen TV.The bathroom was spotlessly clean, and equipped with a superb shower cubicle. Everything from spare toothbrushes, razors , shower caps, shoe polishing sponges and a very handy sewing kit. Huge, white fluffy bath sheets too.The airconditioning unit was very efficient. The double glazing kept out all noise, and the shutters were excellent too. It was hard to believe that you were only a couple of hundred yards away from the Grand Canal, you heard nothing, not even the church bells!The entry hall was all marble, as were the two flights of stairs you had to climb to get to our suite. Entry was via a buzzer system operated from the reception area, then a security card key to your suite. We were never kept waiting to get in form more than a minute.The hotel has tables and chairs right on the Grand Canal, and a shady area to the side under two large sun shades. We sat there for a couple of hours every afternoon with a drink or two just watching Venice pass by. Entertainment was provided by the Gondoliers based at the Gondola station right outside the notel, their banter is wonderful to watch. Breakfast was very good, cheese and cold meats, boiled eggs yoghurts, cereals, juice and a wide array of pastries and fresh fruit. We got down later one morning, nearer 10 than 7, and there was still plenty to choose from. Fresh coffee is made for you from an impressive machine at reception. A choice of teas was also available.The breakfast room was very well presented, and you can also breakfast outside or in the bar area. We did all three during our stay.The reception staff and all the waiting/bar staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble.Reception was full of flowers, and an enduring memory of the hotel will be the scent of lilies, gorgeous!We will definately be returning, and recommending it to anyone we know is intending to visit Venice. Almost forgot, it is even easier to find it when you arrive at Piazza Roma than the website says, and takes less than 10 minutes to walk even with a case. They were also more than happy to store our luggage before and after check out, which was brilliantEverything is right there on the doorstep. You cannot go wrong.We were asked when we left if we could think of anyway the stay could have been better, we honestyly couldn't hink of anything at all. On reflection, a chest of drawers might be a useful addition to Room 515, but in the scale of things, how minor is that?Pretty much faultless, we loved it.

<Content>Perfect location! Great Staff! Hotel Antiche Figure was perfect. The staff were very helpful and the hotel was darling. Great location. We are a family of four and were only staying for 1 night after our cruise. They had a room that had plenty of room for 4. Could not have been a better location. Close to everything yet away from the more congested areas. We are used to staying at 4 to 5 star hotels - we thought the cleanliness, accommodations and breakfast was right up there with the best.

<Content>Wonderful hotel! We used TripAdvisor with some trepidation to help us find a good hotel for our two night stay in Venice prior to a cruise. We were thrilled beyond words to find that everything we had read about the Antiche Figure hotel in this forum was accurate. The rooms (we traveled with another couple) were very nice, one was larger than the other, but the smaller one was still very functional. The decor was lovely, bathrooms especially. The rooms were very quiet, as well. The breakfast was quite good and could be eaten in either the breakfast room or outside right by the canal. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Definitely trust their restaurant recommendations, they were excellent. The hotel is a short walk (ten minutes max) from the Piazzelle Roma but it does require going over two bridges to get there, so pack accordingly! The hotel staff were able to direct us exactly to where the free bus was in Piazzelle Roma to take us to the cruise port. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to everyone, it has a wonderful charm about it and it's location, away from the busier parts of Venice and near the major port, make it ideal for cruisers.

<Content>Beware of Cancellation For our expected stay in June we had made a reservation on their somewhat cryptic website - noting the 48 hr cancellation policy.Unfortunately, our plans changed and we sent them an email approx. 2 1/2 days before asking to have our reservation canceled. We mis-specified the date of our reservation by one day and they later said we had not canceled properly. Obviously, they couldn't be bothered into searching 'by name' and discovering we had a res a date later.What a bunch of crooks. We will dispute the $400+ charge with our CC company and should have no trouble reversing the charge.Buyer BEWARE! There are many other nicer and less expensive hotels in Venice and we would recommend people check them out first.

<Content>Fantastic hotel! We arrived at the hotel at 10am thinking that we would have to drop our bags off and check in later in the day, but our room was ready and they allowed us to check in straight away. Our room was superb - overlooking the grand canal. It was huge and very comfortable. The staff were very friendly and gave us lots of info on getting around, and even arranged a trip to Murano to see glass blowing, free of charge! We have stayed in many hotels in Europe and this has been the best so far, I would recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>A Classy Stay I had a wonderful stay in this hotel. It is situated on the Grand Canal, very convenient to vaporetto stops and the railway station, and a great base to explore Venice. The staff were professional, charming and very Venetian (especially Alessandro....mmm...). The facilities were excellent: classy room, comfortable bed, a roomy bathroom with drying facilities (it rains alot in Venice...), free internet, good breakfast (the best soft-boiled eggs), and competent airconditioning. I enjoyed every minute at this hotel, and I found myself looking forward to getting away from the crowds to relax in my room. When I needed help with tours, again the staff were very helpful. I plan to return here, it is good value for money and I thoroughly recommend it.

<Content>Fantastic Location My husband and I just returned from a Mediterranean cruise and stayed at Antiche Figure for 2 nights before the departure of the Emerald Princess from Venice. Once flying into Venice we took the ACTO bus to Piazza Roma. The bus is right outside the exit of the baggage area of the airport so it was very convenient. Look for a yellow ticket machine. Once you put your 3 euros in ( it gives change), validate it in another machine near it before the bus comes. When you arrive at Piazza Roma (very busy area) you have a decision to make before going to the hotel. How will you get there. We are in our 60's and pulling our luggage over 2 stepped bridges nearly killed us. If you are young, you could walk to the hotel. If not,. take a water taxi at the Piazza. ( Even young people were struggling with their luggage) The hotel was fantastic and the room 411 overlooking the canal was so much fun. When you take a shower, you can open the bathroom window and look at the beautiful green dome right next to you. There are two windows that you can open over the canal and see and hear all of the action, but once you close the windows, we couldn't hear anything. Amazing! We could see the Railway Station right across the canal. The breakfast in the morning was typical European and we loved the little cappicino machine. Take your breakfast out to the tables in front of or the side of the hotel to eat. Don't miss the action. We couldn't understand why people would eat in the breakfast room. The staff was outstanding and very pleasant. They answered any question you could think of and drew maps for anywhere. We can't say enough about the hotel and you won't be disappointed. My husband and I have traveled to Europe 5 times and would definitely stay at this hotel again. We paid about 300 euros a night for the room ( directly booked, but don't forget, you are on the canal and nothing is cheap in Venice). Going to the cruise ship, we shared a taxi with another couple we met a the hotel and then it was cheaper. Ask the desk if someone would need to also go to the ship. We paid 40 euros instead of 80 and it was well worth it. It is farther than you think to the cruise terminal if you have 2 suitcases a piece and dragging them over many steps on bridges. Have fun!

<Content>Great small hotel away from the madness Wonderful small hotel right on the Grand Hotel. Located away from the madness of the tousit areas...yet diretly across the canal from the train station and a few blocks walk to the bus station...the 2 ways into and out of Venice. The front desk people are great...reallyu care about their guests...and very helpful in finding neighborhood restaurants. One of the great bargains of Italy is the 24-hour pass on the water buses...take your own tour of Venice by day and night and go see the islands (Burano and Murano). Tip: BUy the ticket in early evening, go for a tour that evening..and then use it for the next day to see the islands. We found food in Vencie to be expensive and not great...but try to find the true neighborhood restaurants for an interesting evening and good food.We were careful regarding pickpockets but did have any problems.

<Content>Great Hotel My wife and I stayed 26/06/08 for 2 nights but wished we were staying longer, and can honestly say this is a great hotel. We had a room overlooking the Grand Canal with a small balcony. The room was excellent and quite spacious with a good sized bathroom and shower. The staff where very pleasant and helpful, The dining room offered a good selection of food for a continental breakfast at a reasonable 7 euros. Although being opposite the railway station is probably not the best view on theGrand Canal it made for a lively scene and this placed it very near the bridge to cross to the Vaperetto stops, and with the passes we had purchased at the airport, this allowed us to have unlimited rides on the local transport placing us very near all the sights. The hotel was also 5 minutes walk from Piazalle Roma where we collected our hire car for our onward journey.I can recomend this hotel to anyone for a stay inVenice and will happily return on the next possible occasion.

<Content>A Great Hotel - go there! We stayed at this hotel in June 2008 and all the rave reviews were right on! The hotel is beautiful and the staff are all uniformly pleasant and go out of their way to be helpful and welcoming. This location is excellent because it's away from the main tourist areas of San Marco Square but is located near water bus stops and you can get anywhere you want easily and quickly.Only 1 warning - This is not a hotel for people who are frail, with bad backs or with disabilities. If you arrive from the airport by bus, this hotel requires you to traverse 2 bridges from the Piazzale Roma each with at least 10 steps up and back down. Or if you arrive at the train station which is literally across the canal from the hotel, you must climb a bridge with 50 steps up and the same number down...easy with no luggage but quite a workout if you are carrying 50 lb. bags with you. Be forewarned.Make sure you get restaurant recommendations from the front desk staff. All were very good and we were never disappointed. All in all, an excellent hotel experience and I would unhesitatingly recommend it to any traveller.

<Content>Impressive After seeing the many reviews here, I booked this hotel pre-cruise. I tried through travelocity and then, finally got this off an european website.This is a fabulous hotel. We were extremely impressed by the location, friendliness of the staff, quality of the room, and the breakfast as well.It felt like a small intimate boutique hotel. It is located near the station. Only had to carry our luggage over 2 bridges! We arrived late and the staff had everything ready for us. The room was elegant and large. The washroom clean and tidy. In room safe. Breakfast was great as well. Free internet in the lobby. Wish we could have stayed longer.Couldn't have asked for a better hotel. Highly highly recommended. Worth any reasonable cost.

<Content>Second Stay and Still Fabulous This is our second time staying at the Antiche Figure. Our visit this time was at the end of our Wedding/Honeymooon travels through Italy. We were a party of 7-- some of us were upgraded to the Residence Suite and some stayed in the main hotel. We all loved our stay!These new suites were great-- beautiful furnishings, sitting area, and best hair dryer I used during the entire vacation. :-) Breakfast was wonderful.My little nephew even got a surprise gondola toy when we checked out.The location is great. We will never stay anywhere in Venice but the Antiche Figure.

<Content>What a find! We are 2 seniors from Australia who just spent 4 weeks travelling by train through southern Germany, Austria, Slovenia and northern Italy. All of our accommodation was booked online, but our 3 night stay at Hotel Antiche Figure was the best. First of all the hotel was easy to find since it is located directly across the Grand Canal from the main train station. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and told our room was ready, but a newly-renovated suite nearby was offered for the same price. We opted for the beautifully decorated suite with a living area, kitchenette, large bedroom with canopy bed and complete bathroom with all mod-cons. Breakfast was served each morning in the main hotel. The manager and his staff spoke perfect English. Nearby restaurants, patronized by the locals, were recommended. Advice on the ferries and sightseeing hints were given. Even a water taxi ride and guided tour through one of the glass factories on Murano Island were arranged for us with 15 minutes notice. We could not have wished for a more pleasant stay.

<Content>A little Gem in Venice II guess all the preceding reviews some up this little gem of a hotel in Venice.We booked one of the suites which are in a separate building about 30 meters away from the hotel. The standard of furnishing and comfort are excellent and they are quiet being off the Grand Canal, views from these rooms are limited. The suites are well equipped, with kitchen and seating area and bedroom and bathroom. They are small, but not unusual for a city and OK for a few days which is the usual case. So if you are after a view of the Grand Canal book in to the main hotel. The breakfast is served in the main hotel and reasonably good. The staff are all helpful and will provide any information or assistance you require. The location is ideal if you are arriving or leaving by road or rail and convenient for the Vapporato. This is good value, and quality accommodation for Venice.

<Content>Perfect. WILL return I booked this hotel upon seeing its reasonable price and high rating, and my expectation were all exceeded. The staff was extremely helpful, and made sure we had everything we needed. There was free internet and free breakfast. After arriving in Venice, I was so thankful that the hotel was located where it was. It would have been so stressful to have to search through the alleys immediately upon arriving in a foreign city.This was for our honeymoon. We stayed for 3 nights in a standard room, went to rome for 1 night (and stayed in a 4star that pales in comparison to AF) then came back and spend a night in a deluxe with a view.Their bathrooms are amazing.Things you should know an expect.1. Building in venice are close together, if you don't pay for a view, don't expect one, and don't complain when you look out your window and see the side of a building.2. The grand canal is Venice major street, boats are loud, it will not be silent.I am getting ALL nostolgic just writing this.

<Content>Just as good as everyone says! We booked a double deluxe canal view room for 2 nights for the beginning of our honeymoon. Our check in was smooth and the front desk personnel were wonderful.LOCATION: Superb! We came into Venice by train and the hotel is located directly across the canal from the train station. The most difficult portion is dragging two 50 lb luggage bag over the bridge. There are only steps, no smooth part to pull them! The other benefit of this location is that is located next to a vaperetto stop (water bus) that takes you wherever you want to go. If you desire to walk (which we did), it takes only about 20 minutes to walk to St. Marks Square and about 10 minutes to Rialto Bridge. Frankly you have so much fun walking you don't even notice the length!ROOM: Our room was very spacious for a European room. Beds were firm as to be expected, but fine. The view is really nice, but a little noisy in the morning with all of the water traffic. I really didn't care. The bathroom was great with a deep tub, double sinks, robes, and tons of hot water!FOOD: We didn't eat at the hotel. We ate in the town.SERVICE: The front desk personnel are amazing! They wil help you find anything, explain how to get there in detail, and put it on a map. All of this will a pleasant, friendly attitude!I didn't post any pictures, because mine are all the same as everyone else's.

<Content>Wonderful hotel, cannot wait to return I stayed at this lovely hotel in this beautiful city for three nights (May 22 - 25) and I wish had booked a longer stay. I would like to keep the hotel a secret but that would not be fair! They deserve the business. The staff made my stay very special. By far this was the best hotel that I stayed at in Italy. I would recommend you choose this property for your stay for the following reasons:The staff - From the minute I arrived I was treated with the utmost courtesy and professionalism. All of the staff (I apologize I do not know all of their names) were wonderful. Each guest is treated like a valued customer. The lovely lady at the front desk was so pleasant when I arrived. She took the time to explain all of the main sites and options for accessing Venice. Linda (the very nice lady in the breakfast room) makes you a great cappuccino in the morning and is very pleasant. It is a nice way to start your day. The breakfast selection was great (meats, cheeses, cereals, pastries and juice). The location - it is right across the canal from the train station. You exit the train station to the left, cross the bridge and turn right and you are at the hotel. You do not have to drag your luggage on boats and canals. It is very convenient. In addition, the vaporetto stop (Ferrovia) is across the canal so you can easily access all of the sites. Tip:you can buy a 48 hour ACTV pass for 26.00 Euros or a 72 hour pass for 31 Euros. Walking is also possible with the signs that point you to San Marco and Rialto. I recommend a walk at night in particular. The room - I was upgraded to a beautiful suite which was located beside the hotel. It was spotlessly clean with excellent housekeeping service. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was large with a shower/tub combination. The suite had a full kitchen and two TVs. The toiletries were very nice and replaced daily.The hotel also has a very nice bar and at night you can sit at your table and enjoy a glass of wine while overlooking the canal. TIP: I enjoyed a lovely meal at Trattoria al Ponte Tel: [-] Address: Ponte del Megio (Calle Larga), Santa Croce 1666 The sea bass was excellent!I cannot wait to return to Venice and to this hotel. Thanks again to all of the staff at the Hotel Antiche Figure for your hospitality.

<Content>Fantastic service We stayed at this fantastic little hotel for a long weekend in Venice. We stayed in the Residence Suite (small but well-fitted bedroom and a living room with double sofa bed) with our two children. The rooms are decorated in an ornate, Venetian style and come with every necessity, including a small kitchenette.The main reason our visit was such a success was the amazingly helpful attitude of all the staff. Everyone was very friendly and went out of their way to help us settle and find the best things to see and do.The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the Piazza Roma Bus Station and across the Grande Canale from the Railway Station. It is so easy to find - we strolled straight to it. Just get a bus from the airport and you are in the hotel in under 20 minuites!!If you want to enjoy great hospitality, deal with professional yet friendly staff, have super clean bedrooms in a great location - this is the hotel for you.We can't wait to return.

<Content>The Best We researched Venice hotels for 6 months before choosing Hotel Antiche Figure for our 6 nights stay. We took the negative comment (which are view) with a grain of salt. People FIND THINGS to complain about.Our stay was excellent from the moment we arrived. Check in was fast and efficient . We were upgraded to the other building which had ample space and beautiful decor. Breakfast and service was above European standards. Thanks Linda! The location is perfect, close to the train station and vaperrato. It was nice to walk the 20 minutes and enjoy Venice's beauty. The entire staff deserves a pat on the back. Keep up the good work. Our next Venice vacation will be Antiche Figure without a second thought.

<Content>Perfect location We stayed at Antiche Figure the night prior to our cruise, based on recommendations from these boards. Because we had visited Venice previously, we were happy to stay away from the crowds in San Marco and enjoy the beauty and tranquility of San Polo and Santo Croce. The hotel's position across from the Ferrovia made it easy to always find our way back.We opted for a pricey water taxi at the airport, but felt that our jet lag, our luggage, and the distance made it worthwhile. We were able to share the water taxi cost to the pier the next day with a couple we met in the lobby. The graciousness of the staff and intimate size of the hotel made it easy to make this connection.The hotel is beautifully maintained and we would want to stay here again!

<Content>* A Sparkling Gem My husband's and my first visit to Venice, was preceded by warm greetings, as well as genuine friendliness, at this wonderful cozy hotel. For an extra fee and the fact that we would be staying for eight nights, we agreed to be upgraded to a comfortable roomy suite with a good-sized bathroom. Therefore, we echo other travelers' accolades regarding cleanliness and gracious service, along with the ample breakfast buffet that included fresh coffee, milk, and juice. Great location, not too close and not too far from bustling main sights, with nearby transportation. Walking through nearby backstreets provided glimpses of everyday Venetian life. Alessandro, Franchesca, Michaele, Linda, and the rest of the dedicated staff expressed so much patience, helpfulness, and tireless enthusiasm with us, as well as with the other guests. One of the glowing highlights in the celebration of our wedding anniversary. We plan to return to Venice, in a year or two, and look forward to staying here again.

<Content>DO believe the hype! My husband brought me to Venice for my birthday this year, a city I've always wanted to visit. He was looking for a 4 or 5 star hotel but because of the fabulous reviews on TripAdvisor he chose the Antiche Figure.We had a wonderful stay here. The staff are fantastic! Thank you, Francesca, for all your help and advice and also for booking a beautiful trattoria for my birthday dinner. It was just perfect. The staff at the trattoria even sang Happy Birthday to me and brought out my pudding complete with birthday candle. I knew that my husband would never have thought of doing this and the waiter told me that Francesca had let him know at the time of booking that it was a special birthday treat. We had a wonderful evening in the most beautiful and romantic of cities.This is a gorgeous hotel. I loved the Murano glass chandeliers in the bedroom (and in the bathroom!!). We upgraded to a room overlooking the Grand Canal and can't recommend it highly enough. The breakfasts, location and, of course the genuinely friendly and helpful staff made the trip so memorable, I'd go back in a heartbeat. Don't waste any time - book it, go and ENJOY!!

<Content>Loved the Antiche Figure My husband and I stayed at this hotel end of March/beginning of April this year for 5 days for the occasion of our 20th anniversary. We upgraded to a junior suite on arrival which was magnificent with the windows facing onto the Grand Canal. The suite was immaculate and each day when we returned to the hotel there was a Baci chocolate laid out on a serviette on each pillow. The en suite bathroom was large and also extremely clean. All the staff were lovely, especially at Reception and if you required any advice on travelling about Venice, where to eat etc. they were extremely helpful. Whenever we return to Venice we would definitely stay here again and would have no hesitation in recommendng it to anyone. The hotel is also very well located across from the railway station and it was very easy to get around from this point.

<Content>It's Really As Good As All of the Reviews Say It Is! My wife and I visited Venice from May 8-12 and we spent two nights at the Hotel Antiche Figure before boarding our cruise ship. We read these reviews before booking the room and trust me (a complete stranger) staying there was one of the BEST decisions that we ever made. The hotel is on the northern portion of the grand canal adjacent to the Scalzi bridge. We hadn't been to Venice before, so we didn't know what this location meant. It's within a very short walk from the bus stop from the airport (Piazza le Roma) and across from both the train station and a vaporetto stop. This means that you can actually take the bus from the airport (~3 Euros/person), be dropped off at Piazza le Roma, and reasonably walk to the hotel with a small suitcase. (In full disclosure you still have to cross two bridges, though).We're young and found no problem making the walk. We can't imagine having to lug our suitcases around to the hotels further down the canal. Our room was on the top floor (deluxe blue decor, check out the website) overlooking the canal. It was really beautiful and they have an elevator which made the trip up easy. The room was very nice. Nice furniture, well lit, spotless, and it appeared newly renovated (not sure if it was, or if it has just been well taken care of). It was larger than the hotels we stayed at elsewhere in Europe. The bathroom was top notch, large, beautiful with marble and Murano glass fixtures It also had two sinks.Everyone at the front desk was friendly and helped us navigate through this beautiful city. They spoke excellent English (we started to feel guilty because we don't speak Italian) and took great care to make sure that we were happy with our stay. I wish we could have stayed longer, but alas the boat had to set sail. That brings up another point. While the cruise ship port is relatively close, it is too far to trek on foot. You can either take a water taxi (they are literally parked directly in front of the building, or you can walk to Piazza le Roma and take a bus provided by the port authority (our bus was free). Less than 5 minutes drive to the cruise terminal.Breakfast consisted of breakfast meats, cheeses, coffees, and breads. It was very good.We made use of the free computer in the lobby with internet access. I think that there is wifi access in the rooms (but don't quote me on that). We were pressed for space so we didn't pack a computer. We will definitely be staying here again when we return to Venice. The cleanliness, size of the room, the view, the location, breakfast and staff made it special. If you choose to stay here you'll be happy with your decision!

<Content>Excellent service, location, and facility Stayed here as last of trip from Rome, Florence and Venice. Location across canal from train station and minutes to airport direct shuttle was ideal. Staff on all shifts went out of there way to offer assistance and spoke excellent english. Room was high end of 3 star and price very competitive.

<Content>Perfect! My husband and I went on a Meditteranean Cruise and wanted to spend more time in Venice on our return. We booked this hotel solely on the reviews from Tripadvisor. Never doing this before, we were a little skeptical and anxious. What a perfect choice! The Hotel Antiche Figure far surpassed our dreams and expectations. Clean, friendly and perfect location. The little cafe' outside was a wonderful way to end the day with a glass of wine and watching the gondolas on the Grand Canal right in front of us. I wouldn't choose any other hotel for our return to Venice. Allesandro and the staff made our stay a memorable one.

<Content>Excellent experience - worth the price We stayed two nights at the Hotel Antiche Figure in Venice, April 28 and 29, 2008. I selected this property based on the TripAdvisor reviews because the trip to Italy was a surprise for my husband's 60th birthday, and I wanted things to be as close to perfect as they could be. I made the right choice, so many thanks to all of you who stayed there before us and wrote reviews.The hotel sits on the Grand Canal immediately across from the train station, which is very convenient. We lucked out as we were crossing the bridge and a young many offered to carry all our bags for 10 euros. It was a bargain! (Note: If you're coming from Piazzale Roma, there is a porter service via boat that will take you and your luggage for 35 euro - also a great bargain given the number of bridges you have to cross.)I splurged on the deluxe canal view room and was glad I did. While it is true that straight across you see the train station, that is definitely outweighed by the opportunity to watch the passing traffic in the Canal. The rooms are generously-sized, exactly as pictured on the hotel's website, immaculately clean, AND the bathrooms are huge, particularly by European standards.Every staff member with whom we interacted was professional, pleasant and helpful both before we arrived, by making restaurant recommendations and reservations, and after we got there, by answering our numerous questions and arranging a water taxi to get us to the airport when we departed. Francesa and Michele were lovely and tried to anticipate our needs.There is a computer for guests' use in the lobby, or if you travel with your own notebook, as we did, you can request a network cable at the desk to use in your room.The breakfast was excellent. We laughed when an American family came into the breakfast room, inspected the food, turned up their noses and promptly announced there was nothing to eat. I don't know what they expected because both days there were hard-boiled eggs, several kinds of meat and cheese, three types of cereal, abundant pastries, croissants and breads, juices and freshly-made cappuccinos and espressos.Both evenings we were there, we sat out in the little cafe area they have facing the Canal and had grappa while we watched the passersby.All in all, it was a lovely ending to our three-week trip. We will certainly return to Venice - it's a fabulous city where walking everywhere is safe and doable - and when we do, we will stay at the Hotel Antiche Figure.One last note: if you're going to Italy, learn some Italian. I did, and it was most rewarding to see how appreciative the people were. No one ever laughed at the numerous errors I'm sure I made and instead I heard again and again, Brava!

<Content>Great Stay This hotel was the ending point on a 12 day cruise and it was great! The location was about 15 mins from where the cruise ship docked and there was a free shuttle to the Piazzale Roma. we walked with our luggage to the hotel in about 10 mins. The location is great you can walk anywhere in about 20 mins. There are gondolas right outside and there is plenty of food places around the corner. The train statiion is across the Grand Canal and not to noisy either. Free internet and Breakfast was a nice addition. All in all we enjpyed our stay and would reccomend this hotel to all!

<Content>Loved this hotel We have just returned from a four night trip to Venice and have to say that the Hotel Antiche Figure was fabulous. Based on Trip Advisor reviews we decided to book this hotel. We were not disappointed and would recommend it to anyone thinking of a trip to Venice. The hotel is located in a very convenient section of the Grand Canal, close to Piazzale Roma, the main gateway to Venice and opposite the train station.We chose a deluxe room with views of the Grand Canal. The room was spotless, tastefully decorated, extremely comfortable and a decent size. The bathroom was large, with two basins, shower and bath. It had a marble floor and beautiful Murano glass fittings. We had a small balcony and were able to view the grand canal and watch the world go by which was a bonus. We would recommend paying extra for a front view from the hotel.All the staff were friendly and helpful. We were particularly impressed by the staff serving breakfast. The manager of the hotel was keen to please guests and asked for comments or suggestions to improve the service given. It was hard to find fault.We do not think that any traveller would be disappointed with a stay here

<Content>Wonderful Antiche Figure My husband and I stayed at Hotel Antiche Figure last week of March for our first visit to Venice. The hotel is perfectly situated right by the water near the airport shuttle depot and the Ferrovia (train station). This is a big factor if you plan to take the train to other parts of Italy and have a luggage or two, or if you will take the train to Venice. Hotel is across from sestiere of Cannaregio, which has a lot of gelato places and restaurants.We upgraded to a deluxe room for 30 euros a night including breakfast. Not bad at all. The room was nicely decorated and the bathroom quite roomy. We had 3 windows that overlooked the water and the street. Our room was on the second floor and contrary to what most people said they experienced at hotels in Venice and Italy as a whole, it was quiet at night and even early morning. We kind of expected it would be noisy, but we're surprised in a very good way that it wasn't. Traditional Italian breakfast had quite a bit of options and cappuccino was better made by one of the servers than from the machine. All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. It's romantic yet not cheesy. The concierge was very helpful and nice, too. I'd stay here again if I come back to Venice. Another one I highly recommend is the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari. The exterior looks rather plain but once you set foot in, you'll be more than amazed. Jaw-dropping, really. They said it rivals St. Mark's Basilica for top billing and I completely agree. Don't miss it.

<Content>Hotel Antiche Figure ticked all the boxes The Hotel Antiche Figure completely fulfilled all my hopes: the room was comfortable, beautifully furnished, large, clean with tea making facilities and lovely bathroom. Chocolates on the pillows everyday and a rose. The breakfast offered a wide choice and was delicious. The staff were friendly and very helpful at all times. We had a taxi trip to Murano courtesy of the Hotel and a visit to the Casino. It was very convenient being near the bus station. We took the public bus for only 2.50鈧?from Marco Polo bus station outside the airport which was fine. The vaporetto stops just opposite the hotel over the bridge. We would always go back there.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay. We just returned from our first trip to Italy. We stayed at Hotel Antiche Figure for our three nights in Venice. When we arrived, we were offered a junior suite that was actually down the alley right beside the hotel. My boyfriend wanted to stay there, so I went along with him. It was very nice and had a very nice bathroom. You do have to buzz to get someone in the hotel to let you in and sometimes that would take a few minutes, especially if it was late at night. This is not a complaint, just wanting to let others know before choosing the off site suite. The hotel itself was very nice and their breakfast was great! The service at the front desk was superb and everyone was very helpful and friendly. We both loved Venice and will most likely return one day. I would most definitely stay at Hotel Antiche again, no hesitation. We had a really nice stay here and I would recommend it to friends/family.

<Content>Favolosso! I have just returned from a brief weekend trip to Venice and have to say that the hotel was fabulous. I booked this based on other travellers reviews and would recommend it to anyone thinking of a trip to Venice. The staff were particularly great, very friendly, knowledgeable and always happy to help with a smile and great tips for walks and food. The room was spotless, extremely comfortable and attention to detail makes it one of prettiest i have stayed in! No traveller would be disappointed with a stay here! convenience to the bus station is a huge advantage as it was nice not to have to walk far with bags etc! and it is not at all noisy and being able to sit out side with a view of the grand canal watching the world go by was brilliant. Hope the owners are very proud of their staff as they really do make the hotel a very enjoyable spot to stay in and i have recommended it on to friends!

<Content>Perfect Venice Hotel We had three days in Venice, and I chose this hotel after reading the Tripadvisor reviews. I think this must be the perfect hotel in Venice, for the following reasons: Location - so easy to find, and only a few minutes from the excellent airport bus service. Welcoming - the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful, with suggestions on what to do and see, also advising on nearby restaurants, which were excellent. Beautiful - we upgraded to a Deluxe room, which was palatial, and beautifully decorated and furnished, with direct views of the Grand Canal from the windows. I was delighted to find tea/coffee making facilities in the room - every detail had been thought of, right down to fluffy towelling robes and slippers. The breakfasts were far better than the average Venice hotels - a cold buffet with plenty of fresh croissants. The bar had tables outside on the canal-side - a perfect place to relax in the evening sunshine. Everything about this hotel is superb!

<Content>Recommended to us by friends  They couldn't do enough for us, spent 5 minutes explaining the city, the main attractions, best forms of transport - useful stuff like that.As we booked directly and they had a vancancy in the suites just round the corner we were upgraded as we were staying 3 nights, which was great.We also got some recommendations for out of the way restaurants, off the beaten track - very reasonable and superb.Breakfast was also great.We'll be back.

<Author>Londonlover7977
<Content>Loved It!! This was my second stay at the Antiche Figure. This first time we stayed in a red room (superior) which was fairly big with a good size bathroom, beautifully decorated, and if we stuck our head out of the window had a view of the canal. This last time I was there I was offered to upgrade for 20EUR more to the blue room (deluxe). I decided to go for it as we were only there for 1 night. Just gorgeous with a tiny balcony overlooking the Grand Canal. Large room and bathroom with double sinks. As others have said, it's directly across from Santa Lucia train station. You do have to cross a tall bridge so hopefully you packed lightly. To get to the bus stop to go the airport it's a few minutes walk away crossing 2 or 3 small bridges.It does take about 30 minutes to get to San Marco but you can take a vaporetto (the stop is in front of the train station) which takes about 25 minutes with the stops if you're tired of walking.The staff is wonderful. Free internet access in your room if you have a laptop and computer you can use in the lobby if you don't. In the lobby my daughter used her ITouch but could not access the internet from our room.I will definitely stay here again next time I go to Venice.

<Content>Just like viting mum's house and being pampered!!! I am a frequent traveller with a few hotel loyaly cards for 5* hotels and that makes me a very diffucult customer due to my level of expectation. My wife and I stayed at this hotel from 11-13th of April and the service was PERFECT!!! The staff were GENUINELY friendly and always offered fo help the minute they noticed you looked a bit lost - they were not doing this because they had been told to be nice but because they took pride in keeping the customers happy.. Its nice to hear someone ask you: Are you happy with your room? It may rain, would upi like an umbrella? We were offered breakfast at 鈧? per person per day when we checked in but we didnt take it up at that point in time but decided to go for it the next morning, went to the reception to advise them but was told enjoy breakfast and just tell us when you check out, we trust our guests WOW!!! On checkout, we were asked is there anything at all we can do to improve our hotel? Will recommend this hotel over and over again - No i am not on commision!! Just a very happy customer.Its nice to experience the Italian Family spirit!

<Content>One of the best affordable hotels in Venice! My stay at Antiche Figure was amazing. The hotel is located in a very convenient section of the Grand Canal, close to Piazzale Roma, one of the main gateways to Venice (close to the train station, cruise terminals and ground transportation to the airport). The building itself is clean, cozy and warm鈥ou really feel like you鈥檙e entering someone鈥檚 home rather than a hotel. The rooms are standard European sizes (American would consider them small), but perfect for resting after walking all over the labyrinth that is Venice. The staff was extremely friendly and spoke English, which made things easier for us since we didn鈥檛 speak Italian. The hotel actually has extra 鈥渁partments鈥?that are available for rent and I strongly recommend staying in one of them if you can 鈥?they are large and roomy (separate living room, kitchen, bathroom and bedroom) and cheaper than the actual hotel rooms. I can鈥檛 recommend this hotel enough...Venice can be a very expensive city and finding an affordable, nice hotel can be a challenge, but look no further than this hotel 鈥?it鈥檚 definitely a gem.

<Content>Brilliant Excellent little place and keeps the costs down. This was a lovely little hotel that we staying in for 5 nights. It is situated accross from the train station and a short walk from the bus drop off aswell. It has water taxi drop off's right outside. There was no noise from the train station. We got into the airport and got blue bus into the main bus drop off and then walked for 10 mins to the hotel. The service and welcome was excellent. They offered to upgrade us but we declined to try and keep to the budget we had set. The room was nice and clean. We had one of the red rooms which had no view but they dress the windows up to make it look better. The views from the blue rooms would be over the canal and would be very nice. We got a 3 day travel pass which I highly recommend as it allows you to travel on the water taxis as much as you want. You are not really walking distance to the main site so taking the water taxis is a must. To be fair its really nice to travel up and down the canal and take in the sights. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant but there are plenty of places to eat accross the bridge ( only a short 5 min walk) and the taxis run till late from the middle of town. The hotel staff were very good at telling us the best places to see in the short time we had. They also had their own water taxi that would take you to the nearby islands at a time of your choosing.Throughly recommend the hotel if you are looking for a budget trip and a hotel that is pleasant.

<Content>Great choice for wonderful first visit Just back from wonderful 4 days here, hotel deserves all the good reviews- staff delightful, had answer to any query, we did take upgrade to Grand Canal view, and were glad we did- you don't spend ages in your room in Venice, but it was brilliant to watch and listen to all the buzz on the water while getting ready!- and the decor and spaciousness were an extra treat.It was only towards the end of our stay that we fully appreciated just how good the location is, particularly for a first visit- you cannot get lost!!- and so, as it's a long enough walk from P. S Marco, you quickly become confident about exploring all the districts, and finding wonderful liitle squares, cafes and bars with a real local ambience. Re the many breakfast comments, by the way, the coffee machine is really for those who want top ups or aren't fussed about their coffee- you will be offered a delicious freshly made one!

<Content>All the charm of Venice After reading extensive reviews of hotels in Venice, I chose this hotel for our two night stay in March 2008. We had requested a room for three people and I was a bit apprehensive of what we were going to get, but could not have been more pleased with the room we were given.Upon check in, the staff was very friendly and gave us a briefing of where we were in relationship to all the major attractions. We were offered an upgrade for a suite in an adjacent building for a few more Euro, but opted to keep the room we booked. It was a beautiful room that fit a queen size bed and roll-in twin comfortably with a very large bathroom that looked like it was recently renovated. It was done in beautiful stone tiling with ample counter space, glass sconces, a shower, and bidet. If you stuck your head out the bathroom window, you could actually see the Grand Canal. The room itself was very clean and decorated accordingly with the old world charm of Venice.To some, the location may seem far from places like the Rialto (a 10-15 minute walk) or Piazza San Marco (a 20 minute vaporetto ride), but it proved extremely convenient to the train station (from where we arrived) and to Piazzale Roma where all the taxis and shuttles depart from to the airport (from where we left.) The only word of warning is that you will need to carry your luggage over the Scalzi Bridge (around 80 steps) from the train station) and two other bridges if you're heading to Piazzale Roma. It's a small price to pay for the great location and sure beats rolling your luggage to a hotel around Piazza San Marco or lugging it onto a water taxi.The area felt very safe and easy to find your way back after wandering all the streets and canals (just keep following the signs that say Ferrovia). Getting lost is the quintessential experience in Venice and it's how you discover some amazing architecture, shops, and restaurants.We had breakfast at the hotel on our last day and enjoyed the simple buffet of pastries, fruit and coffee. The free internet terminal in the lobby was also a nice bonus. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone willing to stay a little bit away from the major sites, but appreciates great service, charming rooms, and is in need of some good cardio getting those bags over the bridges.

<Content>Perfect for a beautiful stay in Venice Stayed here for 2 nights over the Easter break. The staff were absolutely excellent, really pleasant and helpful. We were offered a room upgrade on arrival and we were allowed to view both rooms before making a decision but we stuck to our original booking as it suited our budget a little better. The hotel is very easy to find from the bus station and in a great location close to everything. Venice is a beautiful place and quite small so easily accessible by foot. I would recommend this hotel and would return.

<Content>Lovely hotel On reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, I booked Hotel Antiche Figure for three nights and we were very impressed. We were offered an upgrade for 25 euro a night for a Grand Canal view which we accepted. The room was very clean, tidy and spacious with a beautiful view.We had excellent service from all the staff and the continental breakfast was very good.Location of hotel was good and I would recomend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Friendly and convenient So convenient for the bus into Venice and a lovely location right on the Grand Canal and near to the less touristy part of Venice. We loved meandering the pathways and canals and found it easy to get to all the main sites from the hotel without feeling like we were in the middle of tourist madness! The staff were sooo friendly and helpful - they booked a fab restaurant for our first night and gave lots of top tips. The breakfast was simple but fine and again the waiting staff were delightful. Our room was spacious and clean and wow what a bathroom! All marble!Tripadvisor gave us a great steer yet again! I'm too scared to book anywhere without checking here first.

<Content>Nice hotel and good location My husband and I stayed there 3 nights for our honeymoon. When we check in, the staff gave us a detail introduction of the area and tips on transportation. They also gave us good tips on dining. The room was good size, but our room was facing a wall (Rm. 216). We liked the Venetian decor. The room was very clean and has a good size bath tub.The location was great, 2 mins walk to the train station and water bus. Gondola service is right outside, although I would recommend to take the gondola ride near S. Marco's Square. It's about 10-15 mins walk to Rialto. There's free internet at the front desk, definetely a plus. They're also having a promotion to have a free tour to one of the glass factory in Murano island. We got a private water taxi to take us to the island. It was very nice. I also got flowers and chocolates in the hotel room during the Women's days. The price is quite expensive for a 3 star hotel but it is expensive everywhere in Venice.

<Content>Found nothing wrong here Am always interested in how hotels get such high rankings on tripadvisor. After staying here, i think the answer is: you walk away with nothing to complain about and you realize how rare that is. This hotel was great - not the best hotel of course - but for the price, it's great. I guess it is the absence of bad reviews that puts this hotel in such a high position. There wasn't any one thing that was great - but everything was above average. And if you're spending your own money, you won't feel like you overspent here. This hotel charges you for nothing extra (the internet wi-fi for free was a big plus) except late-afternoon beverages or drinks and mini-bar items. It's refreshing to walk away from a hotel and not have a bunch of extra charges on your bill.I've read all the reviews and everyone seems to be in agreement - staff is fabulous, location is excellent. The only things I'd add: yes, the floors/ceilings are thin. Hearing the water running (loudly) through the walls/ceiling was surprisingly loud. Not worth a bad review, but worth a mention. And yes, beds are extra firm - could have asked for another room probably, but wasn't worth the energy. Also, on the plus side: there's a laundromat right behind the hotel and right near the residences (where we stayed). It's great to have access to a washer/dryer even if you don't think you'll use it. And when you check out, they actually ask you if you have suggestions for them - and sound like they really want to know, which is great! Arrivaderci

<Content>A little Gem Stayed at this hotel last week for 3 nights, booked mainly on TA reveiws but also on price. Hotel is very easy to find from bus station, and easy to access with luggage. Wouldn't fancy trying to reach a hotel right in the heart of the city with luggage in tow.Hotel staff were superb especially the reception staff who were happy to help you with any queries or give you recommendations for places to see, restaurants ect.Hotel itself was immaculate, we upgraded on arrival to a canal veiw room with breakfast for 30 Euro per night, this was well worth it just to stand at the window and watch normal venetian life float by.Can't recommend this hotel highly enough for the money, Don't compare it to any 3 star you may have stayed in in the uk this is streets ahead.

<Content>The very "Fabulous" Home from Home! Hotel Antiche Figure"! Well have just returned from another wonderful trip to Venice Italy and as wonderful as Venice is it is the Fabulous Hotel Antiche Figure that makes you love it even more! I can not tell you how much of a wonderful stay my friend's and I had again at this lovely Hotel. The staff are what really give it that special feeling from the very charming and helpful manager Alessandro and of course the very helpful and charming Gianni who could not do enough for us while there from organising hairdresser's which was a real Italian experience and one of the best hair stylest I have ever been to! to organising advise on there lovely city! All of the front desk staff also especially the lovely Franseca are what give's this Hotel it's class. I do not know of any other Hotel I have stayed in that make you feel like a 5 star guest. The room we had again was the Resident suite room 511 which I have stayed in before but my 2 friend's had not, they were very impressed and just loved it. The room's are filled with every little luxury from chocklate's on your pillow's to fresh flower's put on our bed for a festival for Women while we were there.We were really looked after in every aspect of our trip. So once again I would absoultley recommend this wonderful Hotel to anyone going to Venice there are many hotel's to stay at in Venice but I can tell you for location service and just plain wonderful hospitality the Hotel Antiche Figure are in a class of there own! Thank you Hotel Antiche Figure for a wonderful break in the lovely Venice we will be back very soon!SuzanneIreland

<Content>Lovely room, even lovelier service I booked at the Antiche Figure on the basis of Tripadvisor reviews, and I'm so glad we did. The Location is great, as the others say, near to the train station and perfect for the water ferries all around. We also upgraded to one of their suites - a junior suite, which is not in the hotel itself but down the adjoining street, tucked away in a very very quiet spot - I slept like a log every night. The suite was a little small, but very bright, with a lovely comfortable four-poster and a massage shower, and for a three night stay, a perfectly adequate size (especially somewhere like Venice, and especially for the price). The best thing though was the service: after arriving very tetchy and frazzled after the airline losing our luggage, we received the warmest welcome I can remember having in any hotel, and given a cup of coffee while the receptionist took the lost luggage report and said We'll take care of that for you, and went off to ring them on my behalf. They kept an eye on the situation and phoned me as soon as the bag arrived (they did - not, say, the airline, who were supposed to) and sounded as happy as I did that it was there.The breakfast is simple but fine, the room (that we stayed in, at least) really quiet and lovely, the location excellent - far enough away to make a difference in terms of price, but easy to reach everything. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. I've been back 9 hours and already told three friends they should book there...

<Content>Lovely hotel The hotel is in an excellent location fronting the Grand Canal and a short walk from the rail station and coach station. We arrived by bus from the airport - the number 5 from outside the arrival hall straight into the city bus station - The hotel was a 5 minute walk from the bus station. You only need to cross two bridges and then its pavements all the way to the hotel door. We stayed for one night at the end of our trip around the Veneto area.The reception staff were excellent - warm, welcoming and spoke excellent english. We were on a room only basis and decided not to have breakfast at the hotel (at a small additional cost) so cannot comment on the quality of the food.The room was large, well decorated and clean. We had a room on the first floor with windows to the side alley which meant it was quiet. We had a disabled equipped room so no bath but the bathroom was like a wet room with a walk in shower. Shower was nice and hot and plenty of towels. The lack of bath did not bother us. The bed was large and comfortable and we had a great nights sleep. The only minor thing that stops me giving the hotel an excellent rating is that we had a glass light fitting which clinked and rattled when ever the person in the room above walked around. This got a little annoying but not enough to ruin our stay. It might just be me being slightly intollerant and the person upstairs being a tad heavy footed!?There is a mini-bar in the room but no tea of coffee making facilities. On returning to the hotel late and cold at night we fancied a coffee and the bar man kindly made a silver tray up of tea and coffee for us to take up to our room. The cost was very reasonable (about 6 euro) given the cost of a coffee when out in the city during the day!Location wise, you exit from the front door and a bridge crossing the grand canal is just to the right. On the opposite side of the Canal is a vaporetti stop for most routes. We had a 36 hour ticket which covered us for unlimited travel on the bus from the airport to the city, access on all the vaporetti - even out to Murano and the Lido - and back to the airport. You can also follow the signs through the city on foot to San Marco, the Rialto etc... which are a nice walk away.Overall, we were very impressed with the hotel - its location, staff, decor and cleanliness and would certainly stay here again when we return.

<Content>Thanks for the tip! I was looking to stay with my partner in Venice and thought I would see what TripAdviser had to say. This 3 star hotel was 3rd in the list and we just went for it. The reviews were spot on and it was really good value and in a great location.The location was good, as it meant you saw everything. if you stayed just by St Marks Square then you would not see all the other sights or get wonderfully lost in all the lanes.We were offered a upgrade which we accepted and the room was as good as some 5 start hotel rooms I have stayed in the UK and overlooked the Grand Canal. The staff were brilliant and breakfast was continental - simple but good enough!

<Content>Great hotel, perfect location We stayed in this lovely hotel for 4 nights, staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was exceptionally clean and well fitted, if not particularly large, and the bathroom had a bath and an excellent shower. The location is great, a short walk from both the Piazzale Roma (where all the buses stop) and the Ponte di Cannaregio (where the airport water bus stops), right opposite the Scalzi bridge to the train station and close to loads of good local restaurants and cafes in Santa Croce, San Polo and Cannaregio (in particular we liked Osteria 40 Ladroni in Cannaregio, which is a fantastic seafood restaurant with more locals than tourists, but still very friendly).St. Mark's Square is only a 30-40 minute walk away (or a Vaporetto ride for 6 Euros) but the walk is so picturesque it's well worth doing.If I was to stay in Venice again I'd definitely stay here...

<Content>Excellent hotel We have just returned from a fantastic stay in Venice, and found this to be a fantastic, friendly, well located hotel. The convenience of being such a short walk from where the airport buses drop you off is great, as is the closeness of a Vaparetto stop - Ferrovia, and the Scalzi bridge for crossing the Grand Canal. We booked this hotel after reading reviews on here, and were not disappointed. The room (311) and bathroom were lovely, clean and well maintained. We booked with alpharooms, and paid 拢241 for 3 nights, Sun, Mon, Tues, then paid 25 euro a night to upgrade to a canal view room when we arrived.

<Content>Great Attitude! We just arrived home from Venice(1 hour ago) and Antiche Figure. What a great place to stay. Outstanding management, Alessandro and staff were ready to help solve any problem.We were upgraded(complimentary) to a newly developed small suite that was just right. Two flat screens, shower-massage and small kitchenette all so tastefully done in Venetian elegance. Linda, the breakfast host was sensational. Good cappucino and a huge selection of cereals, yogurts, breads, meats and cheeses.  The facility is spotlessly clean with all fine products and linens.  Truly a GREAT three star. What a value! We have been to Venice before and will return to this terrific hotel. Vinoperson1

<Content>Friendliest hotel in Venice, A Must! Well, what a fantastic hotel. The friendliest place I have ever stayed. Went there Feb08 to confess my undying love for my man, and the hotel staff made sure our stay (and the moment) was perfect. Arranged the gondola and champagne at rock bottom prices. We upgraded to 'a room with a view' on arrival, 312, third floor with canal view, worth every penny, 拢33/night extra. The brekky was excellent, informal, with a good choice. The bar area was cosy and friendly, and they do a mean coffee liquer. The room was spotless, the service was the perfect balance of discretion and helpfulness. If I went back to Venice I would not consider staying anywhere else, and I usually like to try new things. The location is excellent, far enough away from tourist central to give good value for money but an easy walk or convenient water taxi away from the central attractions. Also, only a few mins walk from Bus Station or Train Station with your suitcase. To sum up, it was a magical trip and Antiche Figure helped to sprinkle their own bit of magic to make it absolute perfection. Thank you Antiche Figure, I'm sure we shall see you again.

<Content>Loved it! There is little more to add to the great reviews Antiche Figure already has. Everything you read is true. We will most definitely be back (something my husband very rarely does, even if he really likes somewhere - he thinks there are more places to be explored, so why go somewhere you've already been?). I have no complaints whatsoever - just one request please, that can we have tea/coffee making in the room please? Talking of the room - fab bed, even for my restless hubby - big and comfortable! (The bed I mean, not my hubby!!)

<Content>Hard to beat. Stayed August 2007. Arrived from Treviso airport by bus. A five minute walk over two bridges gets you to the hotel if you arrive this way.Fantastic location, close to a vaporetto bus stop, gives easy access to everywhere. The hotel and its staff are superb. It and they made the stay unforgettable. Well worth asking for restaurant advice. We were asked... A good view, or good food? We chose the latter and they did not let us down. The hotel was comfortable, clean and welcoming. If you can, stay here.

<Content>Great little hotel Don't listen to the reviewers that say to avoid staying near the train station. Antiche Figure is directly across from the station on the grand canal, which means only a short way to transport bags. Stay away from the tourist trap restaurants. Transportation options are excellent. The hotel is small, welcoming and comfortable. Its easy to see why this is one of TripAdvisor's most popular hotels. Highly recommended

<Content>Perfect Stay The hotel is just as many reviews have described it. Extremely clean, lovely room (we had a room overlooking the canal) and well appointed.Staff are exceptionally helpful and we had a wonderful time.The location of this hotel makes it a real winner too. Just across from the rail sation and the Piazzale Roma, where the buses arrive, means you are perfectly located for getting around Venice. Looking forward to returning!

<Content>perfect service my friend and I have been doing a winter weekend for the last two years and have been to rome and venice so far. we always look at trip advisor for recommended hotels. This last trip we chose the antiche figure a very cosy and welcoming hotel which made our stay. The rooms were clean and smart but it was the service from the reception staff that made our stay. They were polite and helpful and we will recommend this hotel to our friends. Venice is charming and full of history. We mostly ate at this canteen place called Brek where we could get a hearty meal for around 15 euros for both including some wine.

<Content>Grand Canal Treat After several trips to Venice, we couldn't imagine a better experience than the staff and accommodations at this comfortable hotel. The rooms are handsome, clean, and pretty classy; the free buffet breakfast was complete and tasty; the staff was entirely excellent in every regard, including help in any matters that might arise; the location is ideal [directly across the Grand Canal from the main train station] and the outside activity is reasonably quiet, with endless ways to find the glories of sights, restaurants, and shops. We researched Venice hotels on the Trip Advisor website...and those reviews helped us have a terrific experience! We hope that these words will help you in your own search. We doubt that there are many other values for the money like the Antiche Figure....

<Content>Great location, hotel  Very nice suprise! The rooms and bathrooms were very clean and tastefully decorated and a decent size (even had a bidet), not at all the older tired look we expected. We took a public bus from the airport to the last stop - Pizzale Roma and from there it was a ten minute walk over two bridges - a little odd with all the suitcases but you see lots of people doing it (no ramps on the bridges so you have to deal with the stairs) - very cheap commute about 3GBP, unlike I believe a water shuttle. Very conveniently located, close to many stores and restaurants and a walk to St. Marks Square. The hotel will even arrange a complimentary water shuttle to the glass factory (no sales pressure watch the glass blowing and leave if you like). We had breakfast each morning sitting outside by the canal which was lovely (self serve continental breakfast was adequate). Opposite the hotel is a beautiful church (interior is very impressive - take the 2 mins to check it out). Outside the hotel you can even get a gondala. We were allowed to drink our own wine bottles in the seating area by the canal (instead of their bar service). Staff were wonderful and very helpful! Would not hesitate to stay again.

<Content>Fabulous We were amazed this hotel only has 3 stars. It's fantastic. The room we stayed in was large, clean, very well decorated with a huge bed and nice furnishings. The en-suite was spacious and of a high standard.We paid a little extra for a view of the Grand Canal - which we thought was worth it.It's got a great location - right opposite the main station and close to the main waterbus stops. It's an easy 15 minute walk to Rialto and St Mark's Square.We always thought hotel accommodation in Venice was overpriced. This little gem showed us that's not necessarily true.

<Content>Well worth its 3 star+ rating My husband and I stayed at this hotel 6th-9th January 2008. I booked this hotel as a birthday surprise for my husband and although we had stayed in Venice before and loved the hotel we chose then, I decided on the Antiche Figure as the reviews were excellent and it was so central. We were not disappointed, it was an easy walk from the Bus station, over 2 small bridges. The welcome we received on arrival was very friendly and throughout our stay our every need was catered for even down to a chocolate on our pillows, reception staff organized the secret itinerary tour of Doges Palace (16 euros) which was fascinating, they also organized a free taxi transfer from the hotel's landing stage to a Murano glass factory  showroom which I would not recommend as although they say there is no obligation to buy we definitely felt uncomfortable not buying any of the beautiful glassware on display, also there was no route through to the rest of the island which meant we had a wait of 30 mins before we were picked up and dumped at Fondamente Nuove the nearest vaporetto stop on Venice. We later returned to Murano by vaporetto (No 42) and enjoyed walking through and seeing the rest of the island. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely use this Hotel again.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Antiche Figure for three nights from 3rd to 6thJanuary and could not recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff were very welcoming on arrival and provided a map and advice on how toget around. The room was lovely and spotlessly clean, as was the bathroom. The location of the hotel is perfect as it is directly across the way from a waterbus stop. We bought a 3 day pass for publictransport for 30 Euro and this covered the bus from the airport and all travel on the waterbus - excellent value. The bus from the airportis just a 5 minute walk to the hotel. We travelled on the waterbus to St. Mark's Square, Rialto etc. We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would definitely stay there if we return to Venice again.

<Content>Lovely - decor, location, service! The rooms are nicely decorated in a historic style. Bathrooms were large, marble floors, big showers, great toiletries. Great location on the canal! Ideal if you arrive to the train station which is directly across the canal from the hotel. Also just across the canal is one of the public water bus stops (use it - very convienent service! although take many walks too as the streets of Venice are amazing and fun!) Service was spectacular - they were so helpful, friendly and sincere! Breakfast was good, nothing elaborate. I actually did not like that they used a coffee machine (i.e. the kind that makes coffee, cappucino, hot choc, etc with the push of a vending-machine-like button). I would have preferred fresh, real coffee. Overall, spectacular! I will stay there again and will recommend it to friends (A friend actually recommended it to me!)

<Content>Perfect Location and Perfect Service I took my partner there for his birthday...and so what a birthday he had. We arrived about 21h00 on the Wednesday evening so I phoned just to let them know that we were still coming but just a little late so they wished us a great trip and not to worry about anything. When we arrived, the receptionist Eddi (not sure about the spelling, sorry) showed us a restaurant to go and grab a quick bite and told us about few things to do in the area, She was really nice and smiley...which is always nice.Our room was lovely and cosy ( the red one) with a great Chandelier in the room and Bathroom (I think probably from Murano Glass Factory) we even had a view over the grand canal...bonus... but still very quiet during the night.. In the morning breakfast was between 7-8h00 and 10h00 so you could have a little lying in bed...nice.The walk from the Piazzale Roma was really a 5 minutes walk tops...I was really worried to get lost but it is very easy to find the hotel, they have lovely christmas light on the front of the hotel so you can not miss it. Just look at the comments below someone gave great directions to get to the hotel.As long as you have a map of the island you really can't get lost .After a couple of days you really get the hang of it and it is pretty easy to find you way around. From the hotel to San Marco Square you are talking about a 20 minutes walk through the lovely street full of christmas lights and lovely little boutiques. Venice is a trully remarquable place, full of history and beautifull architecture, December is a great month to go as well as you get some very good deals on Gondola Ride, Place to Visit (Murano Glass Factory was free to visit....(to be honest it was a really quick visit with a quick demonstration of the blowing glass technique but very interesting).The only negative things I will have to say unfortunately is prepare yourself to fing some grumpy Italians in some places like restaurants ( oh another thing don't go for the Menu Touristico, it is much better to order from the main menu)or museem, we were very lucky because all the staff from the hotel made us feel very welcome and they were always really smiley and happy to help but it will not be the same everywhere.Anyway it was a very great romantic break for me and my husband to be...so can not wait to come back and of course stay again at the Antiche Figure...

<Content>Excellent location/service We stayed here one night after a Med cruise. There is a free bus to take you from the cruise terminal to the Piazzale Roma. The Hotel is a 5-8 minute walk from there.We arrived with other passengers early in the morning. the staff stored everyone's luggage until rooms were ready later in the day.  The staff could not be any nicer or more helpful. We were looking for a good resturant that served seafood. They told us in detail about three different ones within walking distance, and drew their locations on a map with the best route.Our room over looking the canal was fairly large with a very large bathroom. Clean room with comfortable bed.These people want you to enjoy your stay in Venice.

<Content>Great romantic boutique hotel! Just had a wonderful stay at Antiche Figure. Such a quaint prefect romantic getaway right on the Grand Canal across from the train station. Away from the bustle of St. Mark's square, you still have access to the best of venice. We had a nice room on the side of the hotel with a partial view of the canal. The staff was amazing and arranged a free trip to Murano (obligation to buy partially).Had the breakfast one morning, basically consisted of pastries, fruit, and italian meats. Cappucinos were made upon request. Definitely a great getaway for a romantic getaway.

<Content>Taking a cruise from Venice? The Hotel Antiche Figure is wonderful, particularly if you are taking a cruise from Venice, or arriving by ship to Venice. It is a short water taxi ride to the Piazza Roma, and then a five minute shuttle bus ride to the pier. The hotel staff is friendly and accomodating in every way. There is no reason to spend more money elsewhere. This is great value in a great location. Ask for a Grand Canal view room. You will not be disappointed.

<Content>Venice's Best Kept Secret! The Antiche Figure delivers what it promises and more! The plain exterior of this hotel belies what is really inside. We stayed here for 3 nights following a 14-day cruise. We were amongst several other cruising families checking-in on Sunday morning. In spite of the hustle and bustle, we were still warmly greeted and served by cheerful Alessandro and Francesca. Throughout our stay, they were both anxious to assist us and tend to our needs and questions. We had booked a deluxe room and declined an upgrade to a beautiful suite next door, mainly because we wanted the convenience of being close to the breakfast dining area inside the hotel. We had room 112, which faces the Grand Canal. The vaparettos started running about at about 6:30 am but their noise did not really disturb us from sleeping (but, our windows were closed). The hotel does have a modern elevator/lift and the breakfast at 5 euros per person is one of the best deals in Venice. There is a small bar area adjacent to the lobby where we had coffee/tea on two occasions. Internet is complimentary in the lobby and it was very fast.We thought that the hotel's location was fine, given it's proximity to the vaporetto stop (across the canal), an easy 5 minute walk across the Scalzi Bridge. There are a number of restaraunts within easy walking distance. Also, we took a free shuttle bus from the cruise terminal to the Piazzale Roma. Plan on about a 10 minute hike from there to the hotel with luggage. We wished that the two bridges between the hotel and the Ple Roma had ramps on them! To get to the airport, use the B2 bus for 6 Euro per person-the ticket office is across the street from the Piazzale at the bus terminal. It was about a 30 minute ride on the bus to the airport. Venice is a wonderful city and our stay at the Antiche Figure was definitely one of the highlights.

<Content>Excellent Service Excellent service by everyone we encountered at this hotel. We were impressed! The staff speaks English very well, but indulged my desire to improve my Italian. Our room was comfortable with a view of the Grand Canal. Opening the windows at night provided a great breeze. We enjoyed having wine and coffee at the tables outside the hotel after a day of taking in the sights of Venice.We found the location of the hotel to be great for taking a water taxis. It is across from the train station and all water taxis make the station a stop. Breakfast was good and plentiful. Especially liked being able to get a cup of coffee to take to our room before going down to eat.The Hotel Antiche Figure was the first stop on our trip to Italy and no other hotel matched their service.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel!! This hotel is wonderful -- terrific location along the Grand Canal within walking distance of the Piazzale Roma and the train/bus stations, so that you don't have to worry about dragging your luggage all over Venice. The staff speak perfect English, are exceptionally friendly and helpful and the room I stayed in was spacious with all the amenities. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Venice, particularly those arriving in Venice by cruise ship (as I did) or train.

<Content>Great Hotel The first thing you see coming down the steps of the station at Ferrovia is the Grand Canal. the second thing, just over the bridge, is the Hotel Antiche Figure, and what a welcome sight! The location is perfect for bus and train station,and the water buses are right there. We found the staff at the hotel charming and helpful, and the accommodation very good.The recommended local restaurants were excellent. No better place to stay in Venice.

<Content>Fantastic hotel I took my girlfriend to Venice for a romantic weekend to propose to her and choose to stay at the Hotel Antiche Figure based on all the positive reviews on this website. Everything you read about this hotel is completely justified!! The staff are excellent, very pleasant and helpful and the room was fantastic with a balcony overlooking the canal. The only small complaint I have (and it is very small) is that returning at 11:30pm it took us the best part of 10-15 minutes to get the attention of the very unapologetic night porter to let us in. This said, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>I'd recommend to anyone! A very well situated hotel run by staff who are genuinely willing and happy to help you.Upon arrival we were given the option of upgrading to a suite which we were shown, but these are not directly connected to the main hotel, instead you walk a short way down the side of the hotel to another block. The suites were immaculate and contain their own kitchen areas if required. These were a little beyond our price range however so we opted for a room within the hotel itself, again, very well prepared and lovely decor, typical Venetian style. Our room was not directly overlooking the grand canal, but this could be seen from the bedroom window. With the window open you can hear the hustle and bustle of Venetian life, with them shut - not a sound.The staff were superb. Any questions you have about Venetian transport or tourist attractions you should ask the staff first! Also they were very useful in suggesting places to eat (off the tourist trail) and we never had a bad meal.Being on the grand canal, close to the bus/train depot but away from the expensive St. Marks Square region was ideal. Hardly any dragging of suitcases around Venice is needed and a short ride on the water bus gets you to the main attractions.Highly recommended.

<Content>Loved Everything! November 12, 2007We have just returned from a fantastic week in Italy. Our first stop was in Venice where we stayed at Hotel Antiche Figure for two nights. We loved everything about this charming, intimate hotel. Though small, the rooms were very pretty (and clean) and the marble bathrooms were so beautiful that we photographed them! Our room had a lovely view of the Grand Canal. The hotel is located almost directly across the Grand Canal from the train station, which was extremely convenient as we were planning to continue on to Florence by rail. Hotel Antiche Figure also has a charming Bar / Cafe area to accomodate their guests day and night with cafe tables located inside and outside the hotel. For a small fee you can include breakfast in the cafe during your stay...something I strongly recommend! As beautiful as the Hotel Antiche Figure was, it would just be like any other hotel without its wonderful staff! Everyone we came in contact with was friendly, polite and most important, helpful. From Alessandro and Francesca at the front desk, to Michele, who went out of his way to make my daughter 'the best hot cocoa she has ever tasted', to the chamber maids, everyone was fantastic!If you are looking for a small but lovely hotel with exceptional people to answer your questions and take care of all of your travel needs, Hotel Antiche Figure in Venice, Italy will be perfect for you .Lauri B.

<Content>Excellent service Wonderful place. Add kind and patient to the glowing reports for front desk personnel. Here is some extra info:1. Booked 3 superior rooms 5 months in advance via hotel website and expedia for pre-cruise stay. Our rooms on the 2nd. 3rd and 4th floors appeared exactly as shown on website. Very firm beds. Adequate size for us. Anyone over 6'2 and 300 lbs might find the superior rooms a tad small. Walls are padded to reduce noise. There is a lift. Guests may use one computer in lobby for free internet access. TV has English language news channel.2. Breakfast is included with room rate if booked via website but cost 5 euros ( a bargain) if booked on expedia. Ask server to make you a cappucino (no extra cost) or use the coffee machine.3. Arrived via blue bus from Marco Polo airport to Piazzale Roma (bus terminal) in the pouring rain. Bus terminal is an open-air bus stop, not a building. Cheap plastic rain ponchos are assets during the rainy season. 4. To get to hotel by foot from Piazzale Roma, look for the white stone bridge or the green metal bridge directly in front of the terminal exit. The exit is lined with small souvenir shops. There is a public WC. The bridges cross the Rio Nuovo (small canal) and consists of about 40 to 50 steps (no ramp). Once you cross either bridge, the Grand Canal will be on your left hand side (you can't miss it). Keep walking along the Grand Canal. The hotel will be straight ahead. You need to cross another small bridge (about 30 steps) before reaching the hotel. The walk takes about 10 minutes, depending on how well you drag your cases over the bridges. We had 3 elderly travellers who were able to negotiate the step bridges with their cases with assistance.4. To get to hotel by vaporetto (public water bus) or water taxi: wouldn't recommend vaporetto. Too crowded. Water taxi stand is just steps from the terminal exit, along the Rio Nuovo, and takes you to a landing right in front of the hotel. Costly but worth it if you have mobility problems and lots of luggage.5. To get to the cruise port: there are two cruise ship ports. find out which one you need. Ask front desk about sharing water taxi to the port. Elderly members of our group rebelled against walking back to Piazzale Roma to catch free port shuttle. Shared taxi fare with 7 passengers- total cost of 110 euros (about 16 euros per person) to Stazione Marittima. We were met at the port's water taxi landing by cruise staff who efficiently handled our cases.

<Content>Perfect Location in Venice - Michele ROCKS! We would recommend this hotel to ANYONE and EVERYONE traveling to Venice. Since we came in by train and available transportion in Venice is by boat or on foot, the location couldn't be more perfect. Not only is the termini an excellent reference point to always find your way back to the hotel, if you have heavy bags as we did, your only challenge is hauling luggage up and down the steps of the bridge!Michele was an excellent host and local resource for us. He recommended two wonderful restaurants which we enjoyed each night of our stay and Antiche Figure had a warm and inviting atmosphere. They are not kidding when they describe the balcony as small but having the view of the Canal and large windows to enjoy the canal activity and landscape of Venice was an excellent treat.A cautionary word for travelers interested in visiting Murano. One of the things that I really wanted to do while in Venice was a visit to a Murano glass factory. The front desk informed us that we could arrange a private pick up from outside of our hotel and the driver would take us directly to Murano, free of charge. If you are into handsome Italian men, this place is for YOU. Our Italian Stallion ushered us into the factory to watch a SHORT demonstration of glass blowing by a master (who was drinking beer at 10:30am inbetween demonstrations and seeking tips for his 5 minutes of work). Then we were escorted into the show room where a well-dressed 50-something man invited us to look around and choose something that we like without worring about cost. Although we chose a piece to remember our honeymoon trip, it felt a little like lambs to the slaughter. This became extremely evident when it was recommended that instead of returning to Venice right away, we should make our next stop (another free boat ride) Burano where they make lace. We only had 3 days/2 nights in Venice and didn't realize that this excursion would require 4+ hours. Burano is beautiful and we would say that this is worth the time if you have time. However, if you are limited and enjoy history and the landscape of Venice, we would suggest sticking with the cultural highlights and save Murano/Burano for a longer visit to Venice.

<Content>Excellent When asked on check out did I have any complaints or suggestions I said just keep doing what you already are The staff from front desk down to the chambermaid couldn't do more to help. From giving a choice of rooms, advising on restaurants to even getting my coffee right every day. You can't beat the location and rooms were as advertised clean and comfortable.

<Content>full of charm The hotel is located near the railway station on the relatively peaceful side of the canal. We loved the location because we could wander the back streets and avoid the hordes of day trippers and other tourists. We also used the vaporettos to explore Lido/Murano etc If you are mainly interested in St Mark's etc the hotel may feel a little remote.The corner canal view room we had was light, airy and exceptionally well maintained. Breakfast was great. The staff were first class.Another small elevator, however it seemed very well maintained - I took the stairs anyway !!

<Content>Perfect Stay Traveled through Italy during October and, yes, everything is expensive compared to American standards. So, we try not to break the bank so we can travel more often.Antiche Figure is a small hotel in Venice directly across the canal from the train station. It took us maybe 5 minutes to walk there. Don't waste the time or money on a water taxi. Keep in mind that the bridges have steps, not ramps.The room was cute and probably a normal size for a European hotel. The front rooms are suites and face the canal. Ours was off to the side but we could still see the canal well. Breakfasts were standard fare: cereal, pastries, fruit, hard-boiled eggs, cold cuts, coffee, tea, juice, etc. The staff is very nice and language is not a problem. There is a lounge on the first floor where guests would sometimes gather in the evening for a drink or just conversation. I think a major plus for this area is that it is on high enough ground where there is no flooding during high tide. We could tell who got flooded by where the elevated walkways were placed.All in all, we had a wonderful time, even in the rain. If returning to Venice, I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Don't pass this up--Fantastic Hotel All of the glowing reports about this hotel is true. Beautiful hotel...clean...recently remodeled..friendly, helpful and professional staff.......great location on the Grand Canal across from the train station...water bus service is across the canal ..a 2 minutes walking distance. 30 --45 minutes walk to St. Mark or take a water bus to the Rialto Bridge and it will be a 10 minute walk to St. Mark. The hotel is in a great location....easy walking distance to all points Venice. We really enjoyed our stay here and if we do return to Venice this will be our hotel. Do not pass this up....you will truly enjoy your stay.

<Content>An excellent hotel located on Grand Canal We booked this hotel after reading reviews on Tripadvisor and we werenot disappointed. The assistant manager, Gianni, was very helpful throughout our short stay.I am not going to repeat all of the great comments but add some that we found very helpful on our visit.We arrived in the dark and after settling in Gianni directed us to a lovely, local restaurant, very close to the hotel, where we were able to eat (shuts at 11pm).Our booking did not include breakfast but because we had booked through expedia breafast was only 5 Euros instead of the normal 15 Euros. There was ample to eat:- cereals, yoghurts, cheese, ham, boiled eggs etc. Coffee was from a machine but it was fine. The hotelalso runs a free water taxi to and from the island of Murano where you can visit the glass factory.Our room did not have a canal view but we were shown rooms that did have this view. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and they spoke excellent English.This is information that I found extremely helpful when arriving in Venice.1. After picking up your luggage turn left in Airport entrance and buy a 30Euro 3 day pass for the water buses (vaperetto) and the airport bus. This pays for itself after day 1.2. This info was given to me by another trip advisor member but it was so handy. Take the number 5 bus from the airport to the Piazzale Roma (the main bus station). This takes about 25 minutes, runs every half hour and the 3 day pass covers the fare. Stamp your ticket in the orange box when you get on the bus. When you get off the bus, go straight ahead, down the steps towards the canal. Turn left, cross the bridge, turn left and then cross another bridge. The hotel is now only a short walk away. 3. If you have a short stay ,use a day to visit the islands in the lagoon. The hotel taxi service will take you to Murano, then you can use your 3 day pass to go to Burano. This is a must. A beautiful island which makes lace. The houses are all brightly coloured. Plentyof places to eat. From there a short hop to Torcello where you can see Venices oldest cathedral. Beautiful mosaics. Then back to Burano and the on to San Marco (St Marks Square). Allow a day. The journeys take longer than you expect. Enjoy Venice. We did and we would returnto same hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Just spent a week stopping in room 412 which was spacious, beautifully decorated and furnished, very clean and had three windows giving wonderful views over the Grand Canal. Nice touches in the room such as slippers and bathrobes together with sweets and a well stocked mini bar. Bathroom was lovely too and quite luxurious. All staff were extremely friendly and helpful. A special mention to the lovely waitress at breakfast who always greeted us with a smile. Breakfast was far better than we had been expecting. Useful to have internet access available in the lobby. Hotel is perfectly situated and easy to find when you get lost wandering around the side streets, there are plenty of signs pointing the way to Ferrovia which is the train station opposite the hotel or the Plaza Roma. Just a short walk over the bridge to shops and restaurants. When we checked out we were asked for any suggestions on how the hotel can improve its service but we really haven't got any, everything was perfect for us and we would definitely stop here again. Thanks to everyone at the Hotel Antiche Figure for a wonderful holiday.

<Content>Wonderful Staff and location This hotel on the Grand Canal was beutifully decorated, comfortable and close to the many attractions in Venice. The staff helped in every way possible, from trips to the outlying islands to good restaurants near the hotel. We were able to get a top floor room facing the canal and the activity there and along the promenade great fun to watch. The hotel is quiet but from 7:30 am onward the canal gets very busy.Walking or taking the vaporeto to get arounfd the city was easy and convenient and a boat trip to a Murano glass furnce was arranged at no cost. Fabulous looking glassware and artistic pieces on the island.The staff at Antiche Figure were outstanding in their efforts to make our stay memorable but the informallity of the place was welcome as well. It definitely felt like home and we would stay again.

<Content>Friendly Antiche Figure We have just returned from a 3-night stay at the Hotel Antiche Figure in Venice, and were extremely impressed wirh the Hotel. It is situated on the Grand Canal, and is within easy reach of bus and train stations, as well as being close to vaporetta stops, making it easy to get around Venice. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and we were always greeted with a smile. When we arrived at the hotel, a member of staff gave us a map, and spent about 10 minutes giving us useful information, such as how to use the local transport, things to do and see, and where to eat. As a result, we were able to make the most of our stay in Venice, and felt very comfortable about asking for information as and when we needed it.The hotel itself was stylishly decorated, clean, warm (the weather was quite cold when we visited Venice, so if you go in October like we did, take jumpers, scarves and gloves, as well as a good coat and sensible shoes!), and there was a good variety of fresh food for breakfast. We were upgraded to a newly refurbished room, with a canopied bed, and an ensuite with a power shower with side jets of water - very sumptuous, and romantic. The room had all the facilities we needed, including a safe, hairdryer and minibar. There were fresh towels , and even sweets on the pillows every day. Attention to detail, with Italian style and hospitality, is what made this hotel a real winner. We had a lovely time, and would certainly recommend it.Tips: Make sure you take mosquito repellant, and those plug-in things, as mosquitos are rife in Venice, and be aware that eating out can be quite expensive. A great restaurant to eat in is the Alla Madonna, on Calle Alla Madonna, close to the Rialto bridge, where the food is amazing - but get there early, as there are often queues to get in. (Opens at 6.45pm) Also, if you are staying for a few days, it is a good idea to buy a local transport ticket, which you can use on the vaporetta around Venice, and the bus service to and from the airport . We were hopping on and off the Vaporetta a lot, and we reckon it saved us a lot of money. (We paid 30 Euros each for a 72 hour ticket, but it paid for itself in the first day.) Also be aware that Venice can flood occasionally, making it difficult to get around. It wasn't too bad while we were there, but we could see that it could get quite tricky in places if there were exceptionally high tides. The locals put up raised wooden walkways when flooding occurs, which partially solve the problem, but could be difficult for some people to climb on to. There is so much to see, so plan your itinerary carefully. Hope you have as fabulous a time as we did.

<Content>Little gem on the Grand Canal We stayed at the Antiche Figure for four nights in September. We booked this hotel in Venice because of the excellent Tripadvisor reviews and we were not disappointed. The Antiche Figure is excellently located both for the bus and train stations. Having seen people lugging cases around in Venice looking for their accomodation on this occasion and on previous occasions, believe me that is a a major plus for the hotel. The hotel is also across (bridge nearby) the canal from the Vaporetto stop so access to the Rialto and St Mark's is very easy. It is also a fairly reasonable walk if you feel up to the 20-25 minutes or so it takes.The hotel is very clean, beautifully decorated and we upgraded to a beautiful room overlooking the canal. The staff were most pleasant and helpful in relation to directions, travel, advice on dining etc.A few pieces of advice 1) the three day vaporetto ticket is a great deal2) if you have time take the No 1 from Piazzale Roma to the end of the line, it is a great way to orient yourself3) go to Burano, it is a picturesque island and the trip across is very pleasantWhen I return to Venice it will definitely be to the Antiche Figure.

<Content>We would love to return to this hotel We had a wonderful stay in this hotel. The staff is so friendly and helpful, treating us like family. The location is just perfect, just across the canal from the train station and within walking distance to all the attractions. The rooms are clean and beautifully decorated. We enjoyed having a Bellini in the small lounge adjacent to the lobby.

<Content>Perfect in every way Booked this hotel because of the excellent reviews and discovered they were well deserved. We stayed one night pre-cruise and it proved an excellent choice in every way. We took airport express to P.Roma (3 euros) which is about 100 metres from hotel. Two bridges to cross and even with heavy cases ( well we were cruising), we managed no problem.We were on the top floor in a deluxe room with 3 windows over looking the grand canal and it was brill - found it amazing watching all the activity on the canal and loved the elaborate decor - a nice change from modern hotel chains.The staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly and provided us with a map of Venice. We preferred just to wander as there were plenty of signs for P.Marco, Rialto Bridge and P. Roma so we never got lost. We found St Marks easily and jumped on the waterbus there. It sailed right up the grand canal, dropping us off opposite the hotel at the station. For anyone planning to cruise from Venice then this hotel is perfect. Shuttle buses leave from P Roma to Cruise Terminal and as we had an afternoon flight post-cruise, the hotel kept our luggage to give us another morning in Venice.Fantastic location, great staff, lovely room - definitely recommend for a short stay in Venice.

<Content>Enhanced the Venetian experience We were travellling with our two  half year old daughter and this hotel is perfectly located for travelling into and out of Venice, and for exploring the city hassle free. We arrived early for check-in but were offered a room upgrade to give us more space for three overlooking the grand canal. The bathroom, with bathtub had double basin. The staff were friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for us. The location allowed us to get rid of our luggage within minutes of arrival in Venice so no time was lost. Similarly, we were departing Venice by train and the proximty to the station made for an easy transfer. On returning to the hotel in the evening, the canalside of the hotel was dotted with candlelit tables which made for a warm homecoming. This hotel contributed to a memorable trip to Venice.

<Content>Very nice hotel, few quirks Antiche Figure has been reviewed many, many times so Ill try not to repeat what has already been said and focus on key points (good  bad)Good: LOCATION!!! Venice is a labyrinth, which is beyond obvious. (Quick tip: I used a compass way more then a map!) Finding your hotel is one aggravation that you don鈥檛 want to deal with. Seeing this hotel is located right across the Canal from the train station all you have to look for is yellow signs that say FERROVIA....in English it means...Hey, your hotel is thatta way! This is a huge advantage. Plus, your right near a valperreto stop and a gondola hut. Stated many times but worth repeating...customer service. Very attentive, kind, and speak English very well.Overall appearance of the hotel is very nice. Everything is well maintained and very clean.Bad: hate to point these out...The church located right next door is going through a renovation. I am aware this is not their fault but still a little bit of an eye sore. Don鈥檛 know how long this will take to complete but it appears might be awhile.Pillows are pretty bad...thin as a Kit-Kat and piling on top of each other makes it worse. For someone who loves the big fluffy pillows, this can be frustrating.Grand Canal....I really don鈥檛 see the advantage of having a canal room. You have some nice views but honestly it can be a tad noisy and it鈥檚 not exactly private. I would have preferred a hotel with a lagoon view but that鈥檚 just personal preference which leads to my final point.I requested a room on the highest floor possible almost 10 months in advance. We were put on the first floor, not exactly what I had in mind. Could they have been totally booked...possible but not probable.Overall I鈥檓 sure you will be very pleased if you choose this hotel. With such a high ranking I seriously doubt my 4 out of 5 will be that big of a deal in the big picture. Still I wanted to be honest about my stay. The location is a HUGE factor and pretty much trumps any other disappointments.

<Content>Fabulous Fiftieth!! We spent three nights at the Antiche Figure 11 - 14 October to celebrate my fiftieth. The hotel was chosen on the basis of the huge number of excellent reviews, and it certainly didn't disappoint! We arrived in style on the water taxi from the airport (definitely recommended!), and the staff were immediately welcoming and offered plenty of suggestions of places to go and things to do, an attitude which was typical throughout our stay.We were in a superior bedroom, but this was still furnished very tastefully and with the characteristic Murano chandeliers in the bathroom. Breakfast was included, and was more than enough to set us up for the morning.Getting to the sights was simple - just over the Scalzi Bridge to the vaporetto stop in front of the railway station.I had always wanted to visit Venice, and when we return, as we surely will, we'll definitely be booking the Antiche Figure again. Thank you for a truly memorable stay!

<Content>great service Unfortunatley we never got to stay here.We were looking - very last minute -for a small hotel in Venice and saw this on trip advisor.I emailed the hotel direct and got an immediate email saying that they were fully booked.A little while later I received a second email with suggestions for alternative hotels - with names and contact numbers!..... and this was followed up by a third wishing us good trip.With that kind of servcie I am not surprised that people want to stay here.We did see the hotel on one of our (many) vaperretto rides and it did look lovely.Very near to train station if you want the convieience of being there.

<Content>Loved the Antiche Figure After reading hundreds of reviews trying to find the perfect hotel In Venice I chose the Antiche Figure. I was not disappointed. It was everything that the reviews say and MORE!The location is fabulous. We opted for a view of the Grand Canal and we LOVED our room and the view. The breakfast was wonderful and the front desk was fabulous, answering questions and helping us with reservations. They even got us a last minute water taxi to our cruise ship at the last minute when we had gone to the wrong place!!!I asked to see the new accomodations in the back and they are really terrific too, but we loved the grand canal room!!!If you are looking for the best value in Venice with wonderful personal attention and a fabulous room chose this hotel..you won't be dissappointed.

<Content>This place is fabulous! The Hotel Antiche Figure is fully deserving of the praise it receives on this site. We thought the location was ideal - if you are carrying even a little bit of luggage, the steps and bridges of Venice can be a nightmare. Antiche Figure is steps away from the train station - cross one bridge and there you are. It is also close to some wonderful parts of Venice that are less touristy, such as Santa Croce.We had a lovely room with a canal view. The room was done in a classic Venetian style and looked pretty glam overall. We had no problems with canal noise, as the windows are likely soundproofed and had substantial shutters. The bathroom was spacious. There was plenty of closet space and a large desk in the room. They serve breakfast in a very nice dining area just off of the lobby. They made us a cappuccino every morning and the breakfast was quite good.The thing that makes this hotel a true gem is the service. The staff could not have been more helpful. The made dinner reservations for us, and then re-arranged them to accommodate the changes in weather so we could dine outside. One staff member actually remembered where we were having dinner one evening and took the time to ask us about it. They were also excellent about providing directions, which is a much needed service in a place like Venice. As we were checking out on our way to Florence, another member of the hotel staff gave us dining suggestions and even a few menu choices! These people are a class act.I would absolutely stay at Antiche Figure again - bravo!

<Content>Wonderful small Hotel with a view We stayed at the Antiche Figure for 2 nights after a 12 night cruise. I booked the Antiche Figure for it's proximity to the Piazzale Rome (bus terminal). We got a bus ride from the port terminal to the Piazzale and walked with our bags (over 2 bridges) to the Hotel. It was a fairly easy walk even with 2 large bags and 3 carry on size bags. We had a canal view room on the third floor and it was breathtaking. The view up and down the Grand Canal was all I expected. There is some noise from the boats on the canal but with the windows closed it was not noticeable. The buzz on the Grand Canal was part of the Venice experience, in my opinion. The water taxi is just across the canal and St. Mark's square is an easy 30-45 minute walk. The directions from the front desk are easy to follow and the walk is very worthwhile for the shopping and dining. This area of Venice is less crowded with tourists and has more local flavor than the area around St. Marks. When leaving, we walked back to the bus terminal and took a blue airport bus for 3 euros. (Beats the water taxi prices). The breakfast for 5 euros is very basic but still not bad considering the cost of breakfast elsewhere in Venice.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We arrived in venice around 1130 am on a Monday morning. We were greeted by alessandro (sorry if i mispelled) who was quick to offer to have the room ready in 30 minutes for us even though we were there early. We stayed in room 212 which was right on the grand canal across from the train station. Fantastic location when you are lugging around heavy bags and much more cost effective then having to take a water taxi down to st marks sq. We spent one afternoon having a couple beers outside of the hotel while people watching and enjoying the weather. Our room was quite impressive. Loads of windows in the rooms. We would certainly stay at this hotel if we decide to ever go back to venice. Alessandro and Franchesca were very pleasant and made our stay unforgettable

<Content>Wonderful hotel, friendly and helpful staff We stayed in the Hotel Antiche Figure for 3 nights in a room on the fourth floor overlooking the Grand Canal. Not only were we warmly greeted by the desk clerk, Francesca, but we were shown two rooms on different floors to choose for our stay. The hotel room and bathroom were both beautiful and incredibly spotless. Everyone working at the hotel was friendly and helpful. The breakfast staff even made us fresh cappucinos upon request each morning.We loved the location of the hotel as well. It's directly across from the train station and a short walk from the bus terminal for easy access traveling to and from Venice. While the hotel is a distance from St. Mark's Square, we found that to be a plus as it's less congested and allowed us to explore the enchanting alleys of Venice.Travel tip: Large suitcases are difficult to maneuver on the stairs of bridges in Venice. Suggest travelers to Venice pack light if walking to their hotel.

<Content>The Place to Stay in Venice My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Antiche Figure 14-16 Sep 07 mainly based on Trip Advisor reviews. We were not disappointed.The hotel is well situated at the entrance of the Grand Canal near Piazzale Roma and the Cruise Terminal. The hotel is spotless and the service personalized. We throughly enjoyed our stay at Antiche Figure.This hotel enjoys a superb rating on Trip Advisor - and rightly so. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>A charming and convenient Hotel Just returned from 4 nights at this most charming hotel located right across from the train Station in Venezzia. Having just completed a Holy LAnd cruise and a 5 hour train ride from Civitavecchia it was wonder ful to just land at the hotel in Venice. staff was courteous and so friendly and informative should you need it. Breakfast was quite good but got boring by day 3..would be good to vary it a bit for those staying more than a day or two.Rooms were clean and well decorated. Internet available too for no cost....The convenience of this hotel for the water taxi to anywhere was great and we were out of the noisy St . mark's square. area. Just loved all about it...highly recommended.Will return. Priced right too... Lorraine and Charles from Philadelphia, Pa.

<Content>The Perfect Spot We stayed at the Antiche Figure for 4 nights at the beginning of a two week trip to Italy. We were extremely impressed with the hotel, the rooms, its location, and the service provided. Our room overlooked the Grand Canal which was fabulous. I would recommend this hotel highly!

<Content>Excellent breakfast staff In addition to all the other comments made about this hotel, I feel that I would like to thank the breakfast lady for her excellent service. Our daughter who has a nut allergy wanted to eat one of the freshly baked croissants that were on the breakfast table. I checked first with the lady who was serving at breakfast and she didn't know if they contained nuts or not because they were supplied by a local bakery. She got straight on the phone to the bakery and spoke to the baker himself who was able to give her a list of all the ingredients. In this day and age of mass-produced food we were so impressed with being able to speak directly to the person who had baked the pastries. There is no way that you could do that in England--everything these days seems to come from some huge bakehouse and transported miles by road. I am sorry that I didn't get her name but that was first-class customer service. By the way, the hotel provides a splendid continental breakfast, with a wide choice of freshly produced breads, pastries, cakes and accompanying yoghurts, ham, cheese, cerial and fruit. Plus you can ask for a genuine Italian latte which comes in a glass!!

<Content>Wonderful hotel My wife and I stayed here for two nights on the 7th  8th of September and absolutely loved it. We had a canal view room which I would highly recommend. The room was very nice and good sized as was the bath. There was a mini bar and nice toiletries for the bathroom, also houseslippers. The staff was excellent with very good English skills. The breakfast was not outstanding but was good by European standards. The hotel is right across the canal from the railroad station with a gondola station right in front of the hotel for 100 euros which was cheaper than the main tourist areas. An easy and delightful walk to the sights but be prepared to get lost, thats half the fun. We plan on staying here again on our next trip.

<Content>A little gem I just got back yesterday and had spent three nights at the Hotel Antiche Figure. This is a little gem. I had a canal view on the first floor. It is busy and a lot of things happening out side your window which I actually liked. I stayed at the Westin in Florence for three nights and I actually prefered the charm of the AF. I would stay there again. I gave up on trying to find restuarants as recommended by tripadvisors. Seems like I would spend more time looking around for the restuarants and I would eventually end up at a restuarant that looked appealing. Stay a few minutes and look at the waiters attitudes. If I liked what I saw I would decide to eat there. There are several places in the back alley ways of the AF. Breakfast was not included in our package but they offered us a 5 euro per person deal being guests. Breakfast was continental but very well done. I fi booked again I would contact the hotel directly via email. The front desk english is excellent.

<Content>Antiche Figure - excellent hotel!! our room faced the grand canal. It was very clean, good size and well soundproofed so we couldn't hear any of the boat/pedestrian traffic just below our window. Staff was excellent and attentive. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Service and Great Location Stayed at this hotel pre/post on a cruise out of Venice. The locationis great -- close to the bus terminal for transportation to/from the airport and cruise terminal. (Only needed to carry our luggage acrosstwo bridges.) It's a bit of a walk to the major attractions, but veryclose to the vaparetto stop. On the other hand, the neighborhood isn't nearly as crazy crowded as those nearer to San Marco.The staff couldn't have been nicer. Very friendly and helpful, excellent English. Gave us recommendations for restaurants in the area and good advice on how to get around.The rooms are fairly small, typical of Europe. Three of us were givena small suite in a beautifully renovated annex just down the calle from the main building. It had a bedroom and separate living room with a sofa bed. Perfect for us. (Not a lot of room for luggage, however.)The only problem was the shower in the bathroom which had no bracket for hanging the hose. Rather awkward. The staff assured us this will be fixed soon -- now that the August everything closes down in Italy season is over.All in all, we all enjoyed this hotel very much and highly recommend it.

<Content>Very impressive hotel A small group of us stayed at Antiche Figure in late January 2007 for a few nights before heading up to the Dolomites for a ski holiday.We found this hotel to be everything we expected from the reviews on Trip Advisor. The location directly across from the train station was a big bonus, as were the views of the Grand Canal from the hotel room windows. I don't understand other reviewers complaining about the canal traffic noise.....I thought the noise was neglible and what I did hear only added to the culture I wanted to experience in Venice.The hotel lobby and coffee bar were modern, clean and comfortable. The room we had was quite spacious for Venice standards and beautifully decorated. The bathroom was immaculate and luxurious, especially with the marble finishings. The breakfast room was neat and comfortable and the breakfast itself was more than adequate for our needs.The location of the hotel was perfect for easy access to restaurants, cafes, bars etc in Venice. I felt it was not a long walk to St Marks square as some readers have said.For quality, convenience and value for money, our touring party couldn't be happier with our stay at Antiche Figure. It thoroughly deserves it's reputation. I thoroughly recommend this hotel to all types of visitors and definitely plan on staying here next time.

<Content>Wonderful Staff We stayed at this wonderful little hotel for 2 nights in early September. The staff is just great and the location is very good. The rooms are quite spacious and the bathrooms in particular are well appointed.  The staff will go out of there way to make reservations for restaurants and any other services you may need. If at all possible go to the Osterio al Vecio Pozzo restaurant which is tucked into a side street behind the hotel. Absolutely fabulous and a great value. The hotel people recommended it to us! A word of caution to Venezia travelers. The train station is across the Canal from the hotel. However it is very difficult to get your baggage over the bridge especially if it is heavy.We hired a porter and paid him $8 euro per bag and it was well worth it. He put the luggage right on the train for us. This was all arranged by the hotel. We will go back!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Antiche Figure is in a terrific location and is in a lovely building with a lot of character. The proprietor and hotel staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. We do not have children, but Antiche Figure would be an excellent place for families as well. Breakfast at the hotel was very good and a real bargain. Although this hotel has a 3 star rating (from the Italian hotel board), it is clearly on the higher end of the 3 star band and has a number of amenities that 3 star hotels in Italy frequently do not have. We travel all over the world and normally stay at 5 star hotels, but absolutely loved Antiche Figure. We will definitely stay here again when we return to Venice.

<Content>Thankyou Antiche Figure We read Trip Advisor before booking the room and I must say that Im glad that we have found this little gem in Venice as we will return.The 4 of us arrived on the 19th easy to find, and was welcomed by a fantastic gentleman who showed us to our family room with a romeo and juliet balcony overlooking the grand canal, he also booked us a waterside table in a nearby restaurant for our evening meal.Breakfast was good, a charming lady made us real italian latte'sThe 24 hours we stayed in this hotel we were made to feel like family, nothing was any trouble, we crossed the bridge to the train station for our journey to lake garda.The hotel is very convienent for the train station and the bus terminus and for walking into venice as the gentleman behind the reception said to us go and have a walk around venice, explore the side streets you will never be lost how right he was, thank you to all at the antiche figure

<Content>Way above average service I just can't say enough about the level of service at this hotel - I've travelled extensively to some very expensive hotels and this is the best service I've encountered anywhere. They upgraded me free of charge to a beautiful canal view room which was tasteful a good size and spotless. If you're worried about noise, don't go for the canal view (could be why I got the room I guess being on the younger side of the guests staying there) - the noise on the street served as a great alarm clock in the morning. The location is great - not for charm but convenience - directly opposite the train station and very close to the bus station, also directly opposite the vaporetto, so perfect really. the ground floor which includes the breakfast area is tiny, really small and not as tastefully decorated as the rooms but it's fine. You can eat outside by the canal although it's pretty busy with people arriving with suitcases etc. although really not a problem either. The food is as good as any other hotel in Italy I've experienced, they could probably do more if they had more space. In short the crowning glory of this hotel is its staff from chamber maids, to waitress to manager, they are all genuine, cheerful but not overbearing - and the manager (I think he was the manager) could not have gone out of his way more for me or anyone else I saw him dealing with. As a woman travelling on her own I felt very safe and comfortable here.

<Content>Excellent hotel!!!! I booked this hotel months before our trip based on excellent reviews from this site. I was not disappointed in any way. This was our 2nd visit to Venice and Hotel Antiche Figure provided the perfect location for our stay. I contacted the hotel directly to make reservations. We needed a triple for two nights prior to our cruise and one additional night after the cruise. Normally they don't book one night on a Saturday night, but kindly made an exception since we were booked to stay several nights before the cruise. All dealings with them were timely, positive, and friendly. Several days before we were due to arrive a possible train strike in Germany meant that we needed to get to Venice a day early. An email to the hotel easily arranged an additional night. The location was very convenient to the train station, though we had to lug our heavy suitcases over a very steep bridge. We arrived late at night when restaurants were closed, but the management got some food and wine rustled up so that we didn't go to bed hungry. The room was absolutely beautiful, overlooking the Grand Canal. It was huge and the bathroom was also very large and very modern. The management of the hotel was accommodating in many ways. They suggested Osterias and Trattorias. They also arranged a water taxi to take us to the cruise ship as well as to the airport when we left Venice. I give this hotel and its management my highest praise and will stay there again any time I return to Venice.

<Content>Wonderful hotel We stayed pre and post cruise at this delightful hotel.Two rooms, family of four. Location is perfect, five minutes from Piazza Roma. Rooms were immaculate and breakfast was more than adequate. The reception was warm and friendly. They provided us with maps and even made dinner reservations for us! Internet was available in the lobby and it was free. We were in Venice for a Med cruise and this was the perfect beginning and ending for such a cruise. Thank you Alessandro and staff for a lovely stay. We will return to Venice and the Antiche Figure Hotel.

<Content>2 nights - nice and convenient! We stayed here for two nights in August and it was our first trip to Venice. Very nice hotel, convenient location right next to Piazza Roma (where you arrive when you take a bus from Marco Polo Airport). Hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful, bartender was interested in America, etc. The convenience is huge for first time visitors to Venice, because fighting the mobs through the narrow streets and on the Vaporetto may be intimidating and stressful with lots of luggage to get to another hotel. Vaporetto stops right across the canal for easy access throughout Venice, or you can walk through the meandering streets for a great experience. Venice is beautiful, but it is a 100% tourist destination so expect lots of people. Got to the island of Burano - its beautiful! Torcello is very quiet and remote and probably ok to miss.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel The hotel is located on the Grand Canal, right across from the train station and near the bus terminal. When we arrived our room was not ready, so our bags were stored till later. My husband and I stayed in the blue room facing the Grand Canal on the top floor. The room was immaculate and beautifully decorated. The breakfast buffet was vaery good, and we also loved the free internet service in the lobby. Alesandro, the manager, was very welcoming and most helpful. He recommended a great little restaurant, the Old Well, for our first dinner in Venice. He also called the agent at the train station across the canal to help us with our train tickets. At the end of our stay, Michaele offered to mail my postcards to the US when I left him the necessary euros. The only thing my husband thought we would change about our stay here was to not spend the extra money for a room facing the canal, because you see it all the time. I would definitely stay here again even though it is a good walk to San Marco. We also would haved loved having Alesandro's services with us on the entire trip.

<Content>"Fantastic" Everything has been said about this hotel in the last couple of reviews, but we felt we just had to add a few comments.My wife and I stayed at this hotel on the 4th August 2007 only for one night, before our cruise, but what a night it was, staying at the Hotel Antiche Figure. From the time we checked in, to the time we checked out, nothing was to much trouble.Francesca on reception made up most welcome, even helping with places to eat, see, etc. and pointing them all out on a map. The room was out of this world, over looking the Grand Canal. The hotel and Venice are both beautiful, and we shall be returning in the Autumn.If you have not been to Venice you should try this hotel the location is fantastic.Roy  Lesley

<Content>Excellent base from which to explore Venice Based on the glowing user reviews at tripadvisor.com I decided early on that I wanted to stay here with my famiy when we visited Venice. I booked in early February after a long conversation during which I made clear that I wanted two joined rooms for our family of three. This turned out not to be possible (the hotel was planning to introduce apartments in a separate building, but they weren't in service at that point, I was told) so I settled for a three-person room overlooking the canal.The one big advantage of the Antiche Figure is that you can get there by foot in about three minutes from the station, saving you the need to fight your way onto a vaporetto with bags. The first impression of the room was not good, since we were bowled over by the smell of cigarette smoke when we opened the door. I went down to reception and was told they had no record of a specific request for a non-smoking room (although they knew we were travelling with a young child).Overall, we enjoyed our stay. The breakfasts were very good.The room was air conditioned, comfortable and not too noisy despite facing on to the canal, although you won't be able to sleep in much beyond 7.30 am when the boat traffic really starts up. There are plenty of vaporetto stops outside the station which makes exploring the city very easy. There also is a high-speed internet terminal in reception for clients, which I found useful.The one thing that did bug me was that every time I was in reception and guests came in, I seemed to hear them being told their apartments were ready or that they were being upgraded to a suite at no extra charge. The hotel had known in early February that I really wanted an apartment or suite-type arrangement andyet they made no effort to inform me when these types of accommodations became available. I'd willingly have paid the extra.

<Content>Loved the hotel Stayed here for 1 night at the beginning of August after choosing it because of reviews on this site. Reviews are all very accurate - a fabulous little hotel with excellent service. We booked directly with the hotel through their website and had breakfast included. Were offered an upgrade on arrival which we took up and found the room to be very comfortable with a canal view. A nice touch is being able to have breakfast out on the canal side terrace. Would definately recommend the hotel and would stay here again if back in Venice.

<Content>Charming Hotel We stayed here for 2 nights in July prior to a cruise. We chose this hotel because of the reviews on Tripadvisor and its location close to Piazalle Roma. We had a superior room overlooking the canal which is really 4 star standard. And I am told that very soon they will be offering tea and coffee making facilities in the room to make the rooms even better.Breakfast was fine with plenty of variety offered and we took it on the terrace.This small, apparently family run hotel deserves its reputation as everyone is smiling and accomodating. When we return to Venice this will definately be our choice.

<Content>Fantastic Stay in Venice We stayed at the hotel in late June. The hotel was absolutely fantastic. We were a little skeptical about all the reviews because the hotel is so close to the train station. Many of the professional reviews suggest that staying near the station is not ideal. However, we found the hotel to be nice particularly coming in from the airport.We stayed in the junior suite with a canal view. The room was very nicely decorated and was quite quiet. The hotel is near the vaparetto stop and is about a 30 minute walk to Piazza San Marco (St. Mark's Square), which was our preferred mode of transportation. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic, Friendly Hotel Just got back from a night stay in this excellent hotel. We've stayed there three times on three seperate occasions, and will deffinately stay here again the next time we're back in Venice. It's location is great for ease of access to the Bus Terminal, Train Station (directly opposite) and the majority of the major Vaporetto routes. There's a Gondola pick up point right outside too, which if you ask at the reception desk they can get you a discount. If you plan to visit Murano to see the glass blowing factories, It's also worth asking at reception as they can get you a free taxi ride to one of the factories on the island with no obligation to purchase anything.Of the three rooms that we've had, they've all been fantastic. Spacious by european standards, fully air conditioned and with a well appointed bathroom. Breakfast isn't included (I believe) in the normal price, but they do a deal with those that have booked through expedia (and maybe other online agencies) of a continental style buffet breakfast for 鈧?. I think that's great value, as you'd be hard pressed to find this price anywhere else.The bar area is great, and they do have chairs and tables outside so that you can watch people passing and boats chugging up and down the grand canal. The adjacent reception area also has a free internet access point. Above all, this is a friendly and relaxing hotel that we will always come back to.

<Content>Fantastic hotel We spent three nights at the hotel as part of our Grand Tour of Europe honeymoonOn arrival, we were given the choice of a room in the hotel, or, for the same price, a larger room in the annexe at the back. We were the first people to stay on the second floor and gave the room a test drive. Room was charming, with canopied four-poster bed, huge shower with massage jets, and bath robes and slippers. Obviously no view of the Grand Canal, and no lift (unlike the main building) but extremely comfortableWe found the 5 Euro breakfast excellent value - and took the advice of Tripadvisors to have non-machine made cappucinos. Cereal, fruit, croissants, eggs, cold meats, pastries, fruit juice - and we finished our breakfast by taking our last cappucino and a slice of fruit pie outside to watch the world go by on the Grand Canal (worth 5 Euros alone!) I have no idea where people would go to get a better value breakfast in VeniceThe hotel is a vaporetto ride from St Mark's Square, but we found this to be beneficial as the squares and canals behind the hotel were much less crowded and interesting to explore. Great location for the train station or the Piazza Roma where we left our car (just two bridges to negotiate)Staff were excellent and informative, and sitting at one of the tables in the evening drinking Prosecco or Peach Bellinis just people watching is one of the highlights of our honeymoonAbsolutely intend to return, but with less baggage!

<Content>Loved Venice and Hotel Antiche Figure!! It doesn't get any better than Venice and this lovely, little hotel with an amazing location on the Grand Canal! My husband and I spent 6 weeks in Europe and we planned and booked our entire trip based on Trip Advisor recommendations. We found the reviews to be very accurate. We had 3 nights in Venice in a Deluxe Grand Canal View Room. It could not have been better. The view from our room on the 4th floor was captivating! The room was beautiful and the staff were so friendly and helpful. We felt the breakfast was more than adequate and good value for 5 euro. If you are travelling by train don't hesitate to book this hotel because it is opposite the station - we felt sorry for all the other tourists trying to drag their bags for miles and not being able to find their hotels.If you book this hotel you won't be sorry. We loved it and it was a perfest finale to an amazing holiday!!

<Content>Great location We stayed at Hotel Antiche Figure for three nights during our honeymoon and found it to be the perfect hotel for a stay in one of the most romantic cities in the world. While the hotel is located on the opposite end of all the attractions (St. Mark's Square, Doge's Palace, etc.), it was nice to be near the quieter part of the city, but yet still be on the Grand Canal. Plus, Venice is so small we had fun just walking to places like St. Mark's, being that it would only take about 20-25 minutes to walk there (And who doesn't love walking through Venetian cobblestone streets!)The hotel was a 5 minute walk to both the ATV (water bus) and to Piazzale Roma, which is where we had to pick up the shuttle to the cruise we were taking from Venice. To get to the airport you can either, very easily, take the ATV to the airport or pick up an actual taxi (driven) from Piazzale Roma, which is connected by bridge to the mainland. Another benefit was the hotel was right next to one of the only three bridges that crosses the Grand Canal, so we didn't have to walk far to get to the other side. The only downside to the hotel was the 5 euro breakfast. It served cold lunchmeat, cereal and fruit, not enough to fill our bellies before walking around for 10 hours. I would suggest saving your money for a slice of Italian pizza.

<Content>Room Change otherwise very good We booked through the internet and e.mailed the hotel we would be late and not to re-let our room. When we arrived they did not have a room except for an upgrade across the alley which would cost 50E a night extra! They did agree to one night at the old cost and then pay an extra 50E for the second night. Thought this was a bit of sharp practice. However room was excellent, shower etc very good, staff all very helpful and position very good. Make sure you get a good location map if you arrive in the dark. Most confusing as you leave p.roma where all the airport buses drop you.Air con was good which was needed as temps were in the high 30s when we were there.

<Content>Great location and service! After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, we booked this hotel, and what everyone said was right. The staff is outstanding, and bends over backward to make sure your stay is great. The room was clean and large, by Ventian standards (considering we had our two kids as well). Being across from the trainstation is what made it fun to sit and have a drink at the end of the day and watch the world go by. I would recommend the front rooms on the third floor facing the canal(we were on the 4th--the windows were smaller). There is really no roblem with noise at night, since most everyone seems to leave at night, and the AC was great. They have recently added a couple more suites that are just a short walk away with no canal view, but new, gorgeous and modern--would definitely recommend these as well.

<Content>Great Value My husband, daughter and I stayed here for one night in July. The location and price was what appealed to me. The hotel was beautiful. The rooms were lovely, as well as the bathroom. The staff was outstanding, very helpful and spoke English very well.  I booked with Expedia, so the breakfast was not included, but it was not that expensive and was very good. The only drawback was we had a room with NO view ( a wall) but it really didn't matter to me because I just wanted a room to sleep. The location of the hotel made it easy to find and was very convenient for us since we arrived by train. I would recommend this hotel to those who are looking for a great deal.

<Content>Loved Antiche Figure!! We have just returned from 4 nights at Hotel Anitche Figure in Venice. We stayed there prior to boarding the Splendour of the Sea on a Greek Island cruise. The hotel is on the grand canal and beautifully maintained. The service is fantastic and all of the staff we met were charming and friendly. The hotel is right across from the train station and next to the major port and bus stop - we were able to walk with our luggages to get on the cruiseship. The four of us stayed in 2 separate rooms, I believe rooms can only accommodate a maximum of 3 people. My two daughters had their own room close by and the rooms are very comfortable with beautiful bathrooms. The included breakfast is simple but really tasty with enough items to keep us going for the whole day. We hiked/walked to the famous San Marco Square every day. It was an advanture to take a different route on a daily basis. We enjoyed sitting in front of the hotel in the late afternoon with wine and snack looking at all the passerbys. It was a positive that the hotel is not at the center of the tourist area around San Marco. The shops around tend to have better prices and are less crowded than around San Marco and the Rialto Bridge. The staff also showed us some new residential units, i.e., apartments that are part of the hotel in the street next to the hotel. Since it was our first time in Venice, we wanted to be overlooking the grand canal, but we will definitely consider staying at those units the next time. We will definitely go back to Hotel Anitche Figure when we plan on returning to Venice.

<Content>Great Location, fantastic staff! I just stayed at this hotel for one night last week and can absolutely say it is a wonderful hotel. Located straight across from the train station was one of the reasons I picked this hotel and I am happy I did. I saw people dragging their luggage through the crowed corridors of Venice and I was glad I did not have to do that. The hotel staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help in any way they could. Check in was quick and easy. Our hotel room overlooked the Canal and was clean, spacious and quiet. The hotel stored our luggage for us on check out day while we explored Venice until our 2:30 train departure. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Venice.

<Content>"wow factor" We have just returned from a superb stay in Venice.10/7-14/7.The hotel was one of the best we have visted around the world and the most helpful !! When we arrived we were offered an 515 upgraded room in a quite alley which had just been completed. The room had a large conopy bed and a massive massage shower. Venice is a wonderful place with beautiful architecture and plenty to do.The hotel staff are brilliant and nothing is ever too much trouble.We would definately recommend this hotel .Thanks to all the staff at Antiche Figure for a great stay to celebrate our 6th wedding anniversary.

<Content>A Real Let-Down. We were excited to stay at the Hotel Antiche Figure during our first stay in Venice together. We were so excited that the location was near the train station and therefore we wouldn't have to carry our luggage very far and of course Trip Advisor is usually right on the money! We were greeted pleasantly but were not offered our choice of rooms even though we booked our room way in advance. A previous reviewer mentioned that the concierge allowed them to choose a newer room; this was during the same time we were staying here! Our room was on the side of the hotel and we were told we'd have a great view of the canal if we stuck our head out of the window and twisted it around (this was true). While the room was clean, our bathroom smelled like mold and was not ventilated. The breakfast is not complimentary and is less-than-stellar. A coffee machine instead of home-brewed coffee, and a paltry selection of pastries and breakfast choices. We had a magnificent trip to Venice, but this was our least favorite hotel on our trip. It's okay but we would not choose to stay here again.

<Content>Great location, romantic hotel, easy to reach cruise terminal We stayed at this hotel before our meditaranean cruise. It was well located as we caught the bus from the airport to Piazzale Roma and only had to walk a short distance to the hotel. Then when we went to the cruise terminal we could either catch the shuttle bus - 5 mins from the Piazzale or walk (20 mins).We picked the hotel based on location and did not have expectations of the hotel. We were pleasantly surprised. The hotel was exceptional, the room (we stayed in the superior room, top floor) overlooked the grand canal, and was beautifully furnished. The staff were exceptionally helpful. Breakfast was lovely, and served on their sunny terrace.We wouldn't hesitate recommending this romantic hotel to anyone.

<Content>Perfect! We had a marvelous experience at this hotel. From check-in to check-out, we received nothing but excellent service. The staff there is friendly and will spend time explaining the area. We chose this hotel because of the closeness to the train station. We did not want to lug our suitcases in and out of boats. It was a quick walk over the bridge, and there we were! The water bus picks up at the train station, so we used it often. Walking to Rialto Bridge from there was memorable and not too hard to do. Our room was beautfully decorated with a real Venice feel. The bathroom was lovely as well. We have traveled all over Europe and have rarely found a hotel that was so concerned with meeting the needs of its visitors. We miss it already!

<Content>everything perfect we arrived at the hotel antiche figure about 10am on the 8th of july for 2 nights, after a quick and straight forward flight from liverpool to trivosa airport. The hotel and its staff are out of this world, nothing is too much trouble, after checking straight in, imagine our surprise to be offered a choice of rooms, we was shown the room in the hotel, which was lovely, but then we was shown a hidden gem!, we was taken outside the hotel, and taken down the side of the hotel to a door way, with its own enterance up the stairs and wow!!!!!!! this brand new set of rooms are out of this world..of course we opted for this one! We went back in to the hotel where we was given amap with lots of things to do, directions of places to go, and so much friendly advice.. nothing is too much trouble. this hotel deserves all the fantastic reviews. We are hoping to return to venice again, and would definately choose this hotel again.

<Content>Antiche Figure is a gem! We just returned from a trip to Italy and our stay at the Antiche Figure couldn't have been nicer. The location is perfect and the staff is wonderful. They have just opened up some rooms in the building next door to the hotel and we stayed in those brand new rooms. They were spacious, clean, and decorated very nicely. It was quiet and very peaceful in those rooms. I can't believe this is just a 3 star hotel, everything about it is well above that rating. Venice is truly magical and this hotel added to the charm of our stay.

<Content>Fantastic Little hotel I am currently on a two night stay at the Hotel Antiche Figure, Venezia as the final leg of my trip to Italy. A lot has already been said about this hotel, the quality of the rooms, the friendly staff etc and they are all true so I won鈥檛 go into too much detail. What I will say is that I thought the location was really good. If you are arriving by train then it really is only across the Ponte dei Scalzi, just a couple of minutes walk. Ok the bridge is very steep and it can get very hot in Venice at this time of year but if you are incapable of taking your luggage over this bridge then I would suggest that Venice is probably not the best place for you to visit as it does involve a great deal of walking and climbing over bridges (after all there are over 1000 of them). OK there are probably more central locations down the Grand Canal but these are generally more expensive and I would suggest not such good value for money as the Antiche Figure.I booked the hotel entirely on the strength of the TA reviews giving this hotel a #3 status in Venice went a long way and as usual TA visitors did not let me down. The hotel management obviously keep an eye on this website as they posted a retort to one review a couple of days ago which is one of the great things about this site and is what makes it unbiased. Anyway if they are reading this after I post it just send the Champagne to the room ;-).I booked through an agent (otel.com) but then on the off chance e-mailed the hotel directly to see if they had a canal view room. They replied promptly and for 40 euros per night extra I was upgraded to room 212 which had a small balcony, one of only two with a balcony overlooking the canal. This was a great little bonus as I really enjoyed sitting there watching the hustle and bustle of the canal especially waking up at 06:30 and watching the local papers being delivered along with everything else Venice needs during the day. As previous reviews have said the ACTV stop Ferrovia is directly across from the hotel so you only have to cross the ponte and you can go wherever you like in Venice by vaparetto. One way trips cost 6 euros and 24 hour tickets 15 euros (no reduction for children). You can also get 12, 48  72 hour tickets, see the ACTV website. Remember to validate your ticket in the yellow stamping machines, I nearly got into trouble for this. If in doubt the staff in the hotel will give you more info. Use the #1 or #82 line to get all the way down the Grand Canal and to the Piazza San Marco. The 82 is a little quicker as it has fewer stops. Alternatively you can order a water taxi to get you wherever you want to go.Anyway I was gonna keep this one short so in summary this is a nice, comfortable, well run hotel. The location is great for getting in and out of Venice especially if you are arriving for the first time and anyway Venice is a small city so it鈥檚 not really an issue unless you really want to stay nearer the so called hotspots. The rooms are well appointed and clean. Staff are great. The internet connection is FREE just ask for a LAN cable at the front desk (my campaign for hotels to provide free internet access is gaining support at last) which is fantastic since it cost me 15 euros a night in Rome. The breakfast is good, probably not the best in the world as already stated by the manager, but a good choice of pastries, drinks etc. You are not going to get a good ol鈥?American/English breakfast in Venice as far as I can see so when in Venezia etc. It was sufficient for me before a long walk around Venice.I would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>We couldn't ask for anything more. My wife and I were just starting out on our holiday and were spending one night in Venice before embarking on a 15 day cruise around the Mediterranean and then north on the Atlantic to end up in Copenhagen.We were very tired upon arrival (after continuously flying from Vancouver to Calgary to Frankfurt and then on to Venice) and after a slow bus trip from the Venice airport on a hot day it was quite a relief to finally find this very attractive and comfortable little hotel. The reviews that I had read about this place were quite accurate.The Antiche Figure is a real gem and more than I had even expected. The room (311) that we stayed in was very classic with a lovely view out and down the Grand Canal. Everything is easily accessible. The breakfast was perfect! Everything we needed was there and it was super clean and very efficiently attended by a young female server.We know about the importance of packing lightly in Europe (particularly a city like Venice with all its bridges and canals) and pride ourselves on limiting our bags. Even with a pending cruise we were down to 2 bags so you can imagine our concern when only 1 of them accompanied our flight from Frankfurt! Some attention from the front desk to communicate with the airport ensured that our 2nd bag met us in our room onboard the ship the next afternoon! Also, some negotiations with a water taxi (by this same individual) got us a split fare to the cruise terminal with another couple heading that way.All in all, this excellent reception at the Antiche Figure got us off on the right foot to a very successful trip and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>A Magnificent Find! We just returned from a two week trip to Italy where we ended our travels at the Antiche Figure in Venice. I commented to my husband that I have never experienced a better service attitude in all my global travels. At every turn, care was expressed to assure that everything met our expectations. We booked three rooms for seven of us and were very surprised at the ample size. The rooms and baths were spotless and had very quiet air conditioning!This is a hotel for people who want to experience the flavor of Venice...it is very quaint and the breakfast was very complete by European measures. We especially appreciated the very accomodating attitude of hotel staff when we asked if we could use one of their outdoor tables (normally for service from their bar inside) to have a bottle of our own wine. Absolutely no problem!While it is a hike to the main tourist attractions, the rates are favorable and we found its accessibility to the train station a major plus. We had no trouble with family ranging from 58 yrs. to 10 yrs. managing the walk across the bridge though we did make sure to pack appropriately throughout our journey. The water buses are a breeze so we would absolutely stay there again!!!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel and Staff My husband and I stayed at the Antiche Figure for three nights in June in a Deluxe room overlooking the canal. We arrived in Venice via an overnight train from Paris and were thrilled that we had such a short walk to the hotel. Yes... the bridge is steep, but very manageable. Just rest at the top! The hotel is lovely downstairs. There is a small lobby and a bar area. The breakfast room is also on this floor and is very nice and quite adequate for all of the guests. But the best seats are outside at one of the many tables right on the canal. It was a lot of fun to sit and watch Venice go by! Our room was quite large with several windows which opened up to the canal. It was fun to sit in the window in the afternoon and watch the gondoliers get ready for the afternoon gondola rides. The room/bathroom was very clean and the bed was VERY comfortable. Our room had a King bed with sitting area and desk. We slept with the window open and could hear the water at night and in the morning. After 10pm, it was very quiet outside except for an occasional boat. I thought the room on the canal was worth the extra price.The location was great for us since we arrived and departed by train. I was also happy to retreat from the crowds and noise at San Marco's Square to our quiet hotel. Walking was not a problem in Venice since the city isn't that large. You will get lost, but that is part of the fun. Just relax. The best part of the hotel is the staff. We stayed in 6 hotels on our 3-week trip and the staff at Antiche Figure was by far the most helpful and conscience of all of the hotels we visited (and they were all nice hotels). We were spoiled by good service after leaving the Antiche Figure. The staff always made you feel as though you were the only one they were assisting. Even the young woman at breakfast was so friendly and helpful it made you look forward to breakfast each morning. Speaking of breakfast, I will have to disagree with a previous reviewer. As I said, we stayed in 5 other hotels on our trip and the breakfast at Antiche Figure was right on par with every other hotel. They offered a good variety with pasteries, meats, cheeses, eggs, cereal, yogurt, cookies, and various beverages. And we thoroughly enjoyed having our breakfast on the patio each morning and watching the city start to come to life. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to all of my friends.

<Content>Great stay at the Antiche Figure The AF did not disappoint, especially given our extremely high expectations from consistently strong reviews on TA. We were fortunate to be upgraded to a wonderfully large canal view room (with a surprisingly plush bathroom) on the top floor. We loved eating the fantastic breakfast buffet and enjoying pre-dinner cocktails outside along the grand canal. The hotel staff take their TA reputation extremely seriously, and could not be more friendly and accomodating to maintain their well deserved high grades. The AF is well located across the canal from the train station and vaporetto stop. However, while I felt the accomodations and service at the AF are excellent, I'm not sure I agree that the AF is deserving of its TA designation as Best for Romance in Europe. I would expect this distinction to imply that there is something extremely special about the property itself (e.g. well-maintained grounds, charming public areas, or spectacular views) and I wouldn't say the AF offers this, relative to other properties we've stayed at in Europe. However, the AF is a great hotel and is highly recommended for your stay in Venice.

<Content>A great hotel This may be the best hotel overall that I have stayed in while travelling in Italy! We are a family of 5 and had side by side rooms that were small, but very comfortable. Remember, this is Venice and all the rooms are tiny! The hotel is on the canal, a 3 minute walk from the railway station. The hotel service is terrific! Internet in the room is always helpful when you're travelling. Lovely breakfast included. I highly recommend this small but outstanding hotel.

<Content>some specifics I agree that the location is a plus. But you should know that walking over the bridge to and from the train station is not the cinch that some seem to imply. The bridge that you need to cross is high and there are steps to climb up and down. Also, as Rick Steve points out in his guide book: staying in this area you are constantly jostling with a lot of people hauling their luggage to and from the train station. It's not a big detriment but still something to take into consideration.Also, this area is not known for great restaurants and as has been pointed out you need to take the vaporetto to go to the main tourist attractions. I don't mean to ding the hotel but its internet connection in the room is ethernet only. However, there is good wireless access downstairs in the lobby. The breakfast buffet is not something that I will remember with fond memory.I have not stayed in other hotels in Venice and perhaps by comparison this place is a gem, but for the money I pay I would expect a lot more elsewhere.

<Content>A Venetian Gem The Antiche Figure and the people who work in this hotel made our stay in Venice memorable. From check in to check out they could not have been more accomodating. Alessandro was an absoute pleasure to deal with. His recommendations for activities, restaurants, and sight seeing were par excellance! Our room was clean and had a great view of the Grand Canal with easy access to the train station. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel for a future visit to Venice.

<Content>A Good Choice in Venice We returned from Venice and the Hotel Antiche Figure a week or so ago, and as we found all the excellent hotels by using TA I thought I should at a miniumum add my review - I'm glad to for this very nice hotel.I chose the Antiche Figure after browsing TA for a reasonably priced (by summer Venice standards!) hotel that sounded like a good match for myself, wife and 11 year old daughter. The high rankings of the Antiche Figure made me book a room.Venice was the last stop on our Italy vacation and by the time we arrived we were dragging a bit - the proximity to the train station (where we arrived) was a BIG plus, as was the warm welcome of the front desk staff. (It should be noted, however, that even though the hotel is a short bridge crossing from the train station, the bridge has no ramps - you'll have to 'lug' your luggage up and down stairs. No slight on the hotel, of course, but older travelers may want to know this).As stated the front desk staff was friendly and professional througout our stay - they took the time to welcome us each time we entered, and spent a long time orienting us to Venice when we first arrived.The room we received was the smallest of the four we stayed at in Italy, and looked out on an alley rather than the Grand Canal. Although I'd asked and hoped for a front-facing room I was told (or interpreted from the web site?) that if you have more than 2 persons the rooms don't face the front (don't take this as absolute - I *think* this is the case). Our alley-facing room was not a surprise, but I would have preferred and paid for a front-facing room if it had been available.It was clear that the room we got, with a 'matrimonial bed' (two twins pushed together) and another twin for our daughter, was originally designed for just the matrimonial bed. The large bed was pushed out of alignment with the headboard (attached to the wall), and one side bedstand had been turned sideways so they could stuff the extra twin in. This made the drawers on the bedstand useless (they were blocked) and the extra twin blocked what would have been the desk area. Not a great setup but we didn't let it spoil our stay (perhaps we should have complained?). As long as we coordinated our movements through the room all was OK.The hotel is far from St. Marks, but as Venice is small and I enjoy the vaporettos anyway this wasn't really a negative - could have been a plus due to the relative quiet. On the other hand the hotel is very close to the train station (as noted), a major water taxi stand, and the Roma (?) parking lot/bus stand which we used for transportation to the airport.The hotel breakfast was standard Italian and was offered both inside and out on the patio - a nice touch. My wife and I found food we liked but they could probably provide a few different items for children (pre-sweetened cereal, for instance). A free computer with Internet access is available across from the front desk - though with just 1 computer we could have had problems waiting we didn't have this happen during our brief checks of email.I would recommend this hotel to others who like its convenience, and would suggest that time is taken to clarify just what kind of room you receive in advance, so as to assuage any disappointment.

<Content>Convenient Location, Friendly Staff As the over 300 reviews here tend to say, this is a great place to stay. In fact I think all their guests are trip-advisor readers, judging by our experience. The staff is very friendly, the little bar is nice, and the location across from the train station and near the bus stop is convenient. The rooms are pleasant. Their only cons: the bathroom did not smell good, but that might have been venice generally, and it is far from the cenral sights of Venice. The second con is really a pro given the easy location for getting into and out of Venice.

<Content>AN ITALIAN DREAM We stayed at this excellent hotel for a week and found the facilities excellent. Our room overlooking the Grand Canal was spacious and very well appointed. The breakfast buffet offered a great choice and was exceptionally reasonably priced. Best of all were the management and staff - friendly, helpful and always willing to go the extra mile for their guests.

<Content>High marks to the Antiche Figure We were delighted to stay at this hotel. Location is very convenient to Venezia Santa Lucia train station and it was a great relief to get off the train, cross the bridge, and get to our hotel so fast. The reception staff was charming and very helpful. The room was very clean although not very spacious. Breakfast in the tables that face the canal was a big plus.

<Content>Eveerything great My wife and I couldn't have been more happy with our choice of hotel in Venice. The hotel staff is very friendly and gives great advice on restaurants etc. Also, our booking didn't have breakfast, but they offered us to add the breakfast buffet anyway. For 5 Euro the breakfast included hardboiled eggs, cereals, pastries, juices and cold cuts and was a true bargain. The hotel is conveniently close to the train station if you want to take a train ride. It is also close to water bus (vaporetto) stops. Of course, most everything in Venice eg. St Marcus place is in walking distance anyway. Our room didn't have a view, but was big enough and very nicely furnitured. Also the bathroom was quite beautiful with the multi-colored tiles. Everything was vey clean. There is a construction project of the sewer system going on in the vicinity of the hotel right now and workers' voices did wake us up around 7 am, but this is obviously outside of the control of the hotel and wasn't a big deal. Would definitely book this hotel again for our nex visit and recommend it to anybody.

<Content>WHAT ALL HOTELS SHOULD PROVIDE! We stayed there at the end of May beginning of june 2007. We selected the Hotel on the advice of friends that we have that live in Venice, supplemented with the reviews found on trip advisor. The location is ideal as mentioned by other reviewers, you do not want to be dragging suitcases any further than needed! Hotel staff were wonderful, very obliging and polite to all of our requests, We stayed in a room overlooking the Grand Canal, room 111, it was the most comfortable Hotel bed we have slept in during all of our travels! We took advice to get off the beaten track behind the Hotel and a different Venice greets you, not the crowds making their way to St Marco, take this route into town and you will not be disappointed. Thoroughly recommend this Hotel, be warned it is not cheap to eat but with advice from Hotel staff you will find nicer restaurants at affordable prices, enjoy!

<Content>Beautiful location We stayed at this hotel for one night before a Greek cruise. The staff, especially Gianni were very helpful both while booking the hotel and when we arrived. We were given a beautiful ttriple room with a tiny balcony overlooking the Grand Canal. What a view to have for our first, but certainly not last, visit to Venice.The room was clean and the bathroom large and well-equipped with two sinks. The breakfast room was a bit small, but the food was good. There are also several tables outside which can provide a good spot for people watching or just sipping a cocktail from the hotel bar after a day of sightseeing.The hotel is across from the train station and just a couple of blocks from the Piazzale Roma. Very convenient for travelers. It is about 25 minutes stroll to San Marco, but there is much less traffic and the prices for accommodations and food are cheaper in the area around the hotel. Let me say that Venice is NOT a cheap place to stay, but if you order meals carefully, you can avoid breaking the bank.All in all, the stay at the Antiche Figure was very enjoyable and I would suggest it for travelers to Venice.

<Content>One of the best This hotel is one of the best I've ever stayed in! My husband took me as a 40th birthday present and we chose the hotel on the strength of trip advisor reviews and we found them to be very accurate. Its location is perfect - just opposite the railway and vaporetto stations and only a short walk from the bus station- believe me when you're carrying luggage it's a brilliant place to be! We had a side room (314) which was a bit small, but beautifully appointed with fabric walls, murano glass chandelier and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in on holiday. The bathroom was beautiful and the towels were changed daily. I would say not having a room overlooking the canal was an advantage because the traffic on the canal can be noisy and is ceaseless - think of the M25! The staff are wonderfully friendly and helpful but not intrusive - spending time with you on arrival advising you of places to go and where to eat and will book tickets for concerts or the doges palace for you. Take advantage of this as we never got to the basilica because of the queues. Don't go to Venice expecting to be wowed by the cuisine. We found the restaurants to be plentiful, but mostly offering the same dishes and at very expensive prices. Expect to pay around 50 euros for a 2 course meal for 2 with house wine, but service charges are added usually at around 12% so there's no need to tip.Go over the Scalzi bridge outside the hotel to the Cannaregio district in the evening for a stroll. The area is lively and bright with glass shops and street artists. You can walk all the way to the Rialto bridge along a main street with wonderful shopping opportunities and views around every corner. We found the prices and variety here for glass and jewellery to be the best in Venice but don't be afraid to keep looking until you find what you really want as no two shops are quite the same.Murano is very pretty and very clean. There's an abundance of glass shops and we found the staff to be friendly and happy to let you look so don't be pressured into buying anything you don't want. The glass museum is worth a visit too for the 4m chandelier and the miniature formal garden all made out of glass.

The room was charming and very clean with a balcony and view of the canal, ask for room 211. The breakfast was perfect. I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>A gem Like many here, I booked this hotel on the strength of its Tripadvisor ratings and they were spot on! Location is ideal, directly across from the train terminal and vaporetto stop - a good walk away from the main tourist action (about 30 min to the main square), but it saves dragging your bags over dozens of bridges! Staff were very friendly and gave some good sightseeing tips. We had one of the larger rooms which was a good size, with a nice view of the canal. Breakfast was your standard continental and the restaurant they recommended was indeed fine. The price, while expensive for many cities, is very cheap for Venice. Book this place well in advance because it fills up fast!

<Content>Small, wonderful hotel with super location. We selected this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and were not disappointed in the least. The room was elegant and the staff was outstanding. Alessandro even called one of his friends to drive me to another town where I could replace our lost camerea. They were always helping us with reservations and practical suggestions. I liked being on the canal and having a drink outside while watching the passing scene. All the fixtures in the hotel were Murano glass and added an elegant touch. I would go back in a minute.

<Content>Fantastic little gem I booked this after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor - and am glad to report that everything good that I read is true. We stayed for just two nights precruise. The hotel is a short walk from Piazzale Roma over two small bridges, right opposite the train station. The staff are as friendly and welcoming as everyone has said. We were offered a choice of rooms and chose the smaller room with the 'view' of the canal.The restaurant that the hotel recommended was so good that we went there two nights running - Osteria al Vecio Pozzo just a few streets behind the hotel. Good cooking and the house 'white' wine [which is really a Prosecco] slid down easily at 鈧?3.50 a litre! Another very good restaurant we found was in San Tome Square right by the San Tome stop on the Grand Canal. Tables set up outside the church in a quiet area of town - well worth it.One reviewer was moaning that this hotel was not near St Marks Square and I can only say thank goodness it wasn't ,as that area was absolutely heaving with tourists, and the restaurants that we tried in the area were not as good and charged considerably more!The breakfast was good, ask for a proper cappucino instead of using the machine [no extra cost], and they are happy to serve drinks until the small hours in the small area outside! Hope you get your #1 rating on TripAdvisor back soon!

<Content>Loved the Antiche Figure We were 5 ladies travelling throughout Italy and Venice was our first stop, arriving from Rome via train. I had contacted the hotel and told them we might be late in the evening as we were arriving from the US and taking the train from Rome to Venice. Well, we arrived around 10:30 pm and as soon as we walked in...the hotel is directly across the canal from the train station...we were greeted as long lost relatives. Tony, at the front desk was so welcoming and our rooms...we had a double and a triple...were all set and ready for us weary travellers. The rooms were perfect, not too small and nicely appoited. The bathrooms were an excellent size and the beds were comfortable.The rates included breakfast which was in the back room on the main floor, small but accomodating with the usual fare. There are also small tables and chairs outside to have a drink and watch the world go bye and a small bar in the lobby for a good cocktail at the end of the day. I asked the hotel in advance to get us reservations for the Secret Tour at the Dodge's Palace and we had reservations for the next day at 10:30.The also recommended a nice restaurant the next evening for dinner in the neighborhood, which was excellent.They have free internet in the lobby which is a nice touch, so we could all let our families know we arrived safely. They did mention to me that they are in the process of adding more rooms, but these would be mini-apt, ideal for families. The location of the hotel is perfect if you are using the train station, very easy to get to with luggage. I have stayed in Venice several times, and at hotels within this area and I like this hotel by far the best. The other hotels treat you like paying guests, this hotel treats you like family. While it is a walk from St. Mark's , you can easily hop on a vaporetto, directly across the bridge, and in no time you are there, or you can walk..a wonderful way to see the real Venice and all the interesting shops, etc. along the way.I will definately come back to the Antiche Figure.

<Content>Great hotel After reviewing Trip Advisor we decided on this Hotel based on the numerous good reviews it had received.We were certainly not dissapointed, the service at the hotel was excellent and the location whilst being at one of the busiest places of the Grand Canel opposite the train station was very good to access all the key areas of Venice.Would recommend the Bacaro Jazz bar for a lively dinner at reasonable prices and for a long lunch slightly off the beat and track try the restaurant on Murano island (located opposite the main glassworks a dozen yards from the main water taxi station)

<Content>Super Location We also booked this hotel after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor. We were very pleased. We had never been to Venice, so it was quite nice to walk out of the train station and look across the canal and see the hotel. Easy access to the bus back to the airport was a plus. Our room was spotless and very comfortable. We enjoyed sitting at the tables and chairs in front of the hotel relaxing with a drink after a busy day. I loved all the activity in front of the hotel. Hotel staff was wonderful. Free computer use with internet was a nice touch.

<Content>Great Hotel Just returned from Venice where we stayed at the Antiche Figure Hotel situated on the Grand Canal, a short walk from Pizzale Roma. The Antiche Figure was very welcoming and the hotel was spotless, well decorated, a peaceful haven away from the bustle of the Grand Canal. The Reception Staff went out of their way to be helpful and informative about Venice and we had a wonderful stay. Our bedroom was well decorated, well kept and there was a digital safe, mini bar and magnifying shaving mirror in the bathroom. They are also very open to new ideas and are taking on board a comment from a previous traveller and are going to put tea/coffee making facilities in the bedrooms. I really recommend this hotel and would ike to point out that this is the first hotel review that I have ever written so that should be seen as a measure on how well we enjoyed staying at the Antiche Figure.

<Content>Worthy of all the praises ! We booked this hotel having read the reviews on Tripadvisor and it certainly lived up to all the previous praises. It is in an excellent position, near to the airport , the railway station and the vaporetti stops, facing the Grand Canal. We paid extra for a room overlooking the canal and it was well worth the extra cost -elegant furnishings, very good beds and spectacular views. The hotel is clean and very comfortable, it has a warm and welcoming atmosphere but its greatest strength is the staff. We arrived with a problem - Easyjet lost our suitcase for the duration of our stay. All the managerial staff speak excellent English and they took on the problem for us, ringing the airline everyday, sorting out our prebooked visit to the Doge's Palace (paperwork was in suitcase) and generally helping and supporting us. It was just like staying with friends and we are very grateful to them. We will certainly return there and until then, grazie Gianni, Francesca, Alessandro and all the staff at Hotel Antiche Figure.

<Content>Little Gem We have just returned from a 3 day stay and cannot rate this Hotel highly enough.We chose the Antiche Figure for our 20th wedding anniversary based upon other Tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed. Having contacted the hotel directly to book they arranged flowers, chocolates and champagne in the room upon arrival and recommended restaurants in which to eat. The Hotel is situated at the quieter end of the Grand Canel and is about a 15 minute walk from the Rialto bridge and 25 minutes form St Marcs square. The breakfast is more than adequate and the bar is a welcome retreat at the end of a day or an evening out.The staff are friendly and helpful beyond the call and we will return.Alessandro - thank you !

<Content>You're right - it really is nice Just arrived home after a lovely weekend at the Antiche. All the good things said by previous reviewers are true. Location perfect - not near S.Marco but we liked the walk or the vaporetto ride and being away from the crowds was an advantage. The hotel staff were so pleasant and helpful and arranged tickets for the secret tour and gave excellent advice on Murano and gondolas. We also loved their restaurant recommendation - very simple style but excellent fresh food and very attentive service. we would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. We booked a canal view room (212) which was perfect and we were not disturbed by noise, it was great to watch all the traffic going by outside. Thank you Antiche and Venice for a lovely weekend.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great location We stayed here only one night and one long day in April 2007. The location was very good for what we wanted. It was located right on the Grand Canal but quite west right across the Scalzi Bridge. It is across the canal from the train station and a 7 minute walk from Piazzelle Roma. We arrived very early in the morning having just left a cruise ship. We did not expect to be able to get our room so early and were prepared to stash our bags and run. However, the woman at the front desk had knowledge of us from our email correspondence and told us to wait in the breakfast room and that she would send the housekeeper up immediately to do our room. She gave us the hotel brochure, circled the windows of our room and in a 1/2 hour we were in the room. All this before 9:30 am. The view from our room was breathtaking. The service otherwise was very helpful and warm. We would stay here again without hesitation.It is in the San Croce area right near a vaporetto stop. The breakfast was good, free internet access with a cable they supply. Bathroom with little crystal chandeliers, toothbruses and other nice ammenities.

<Content>Fantastic We visited Hotel Antiche Figure on our honeymoon last month, I can honestly say it lived up to all its reviews. Great location the room was beautifully decorated with great view of the grand canal (room 111, we were offered a choice of room on arrival and were given the opportunity to view ) Central location within walking distance of all main attractions. All the staff were exceptional but we would have to thank Gianni who went out of his way to help us when we had a problem with a gondola ride and meal we had pre booked at home.Cant say enough good things and hope to return soon.

<Content>Can't wait to go back to the Antiche Figure! After reading Trip Advisor's comments about this hotel I decided to book this for our 20th Wedding Anniversary. I am so glad I did!!The location is fantastic! Just 5 minutes walk away from the bus station and over the bridge to the train station and water bus, the hotel enabled us to get around Venice very easily.We upgraded to the Deluxe room which was lovely as it was a huge room, tastefully decorated (feel the fabric on the walls) and the bed was massive! Francesca and Alessandro were most helpful in recommending places to eat and the best way to get around and places to see.There was a lot of choice for breakfast. Breadrolls, meats, cheeses, eggs, fruit, yogurts, cereals, croissants and cake. Also tea, coffee, juice and milk.  We bought a 72 hour ticket for the water taxi and found we got value for money doing this. Most days we caught the number 83 watertaxi to the Rialto bridge and followed the signs Per S Marco. This took us through all the lovely streets to St Mark's Square. Spend time there and soak up the atmosphere, it was truly amazing! Go to the roof of St Mark's and see the four horses, we could have spent ages up there admiring the views. To get back to the hotel you could take a number 1 watertaxi from St Mark's Square to the Ferruvio (train station) or like us wander through the street following the signs Per Piazzale Roma. Don't worry you can't get lost and it is a good way of seeing all the little squares, churches, cafes, shops and a good excuse to rest on a bench to eat ice cream! When I booked this trip I really wasn't certain what to expect from Venice, some people said it smelled and it was old and dirty. All I can say is ignore it. Go and see for yourself. I fell in love with the city, it was SO much better that I could ever imagine. I would recommend this hotel to anyone as I would certainly go there again, in fact I can't wait until the next time I do!

<Content>A Terrifice Venice Hotel What a terrific hotel...excellent staff (especially Johnny); fine breakfasts, a room with a view (411), close to the train station. Hotel staff recommendations for restaurants were terrific. Can't say enough about the quality of this hotel.

<Content>What a find This was our first trip to Venice, a special surprise birthday treat for my wife. Not many hotels have as many good reviews as the Antiche Figure and I did wonder if it might be a case of 'the emperors new clothes' but I decided to trust my fellow travellers... and I am glad I did. I was also a little concerned whether the view of the railway station might not exactly be the best in town, but I needn't have worried. The Grand Canal is something else, a liquid main street, and the hustle and bustle on the water and beside it is so engaging.Our hotel room was on the top floor at the front, overlooking the Grand Canal. It was beautifully decorated, very comfortable and, with the windows closed, completely peaceful. The bathroom was excellent. We received a lovely welcome from Francesca at reception who gave us lots of information about exploring the city. She advised us of two restaurants that are quite close to the hotel, both of which were excellent recommendations. They were booked for us by the hotel and the staff at the restaurants welcomed us and looked after us very well.I could wax lyrical about Venice - 3 days is just not enough and we will return... and to the Antiche Figure. It really is a great little hotel, with everything accessible, close enough to the city life yet away from the really touristy bits of San Marco.A couple of tips - take the bus from the airport to Piazzale Roma. The hotel is just 5 minutes walk from there. It is quick and cheap.Take a gondola ride, but book it yourself with the gondoliers outside the hotel, it is cheaper than the hotel arranging it. We did a night ride and I would thoroughly recommend doing it then, you see the city in a different light (excuse the pun).Take the free water taxi from the hotel to Murano (paid by the glass factory). The water taxi is a great ride but expensive if you have to pay it yourself. You just have to make your excuses at the factory for not buying their glass (phenomenally expensive, like thousands of Euros for a single piece) - but that was part of the fun!Use the Vaporettos - cheap, convenient and accessible from and to everywhere.

<Content>Unforgettable Vacation We loved this hotel!! It was our first trip to Venice and this hotel was the perfect ending to each beautiful day of exploring the city and sampling the wonderful food and wines. We had a canal view room with three large windows that was very tastefully furnished and spacious. The breakfast each morning was a pleasant way to start the day and the outdoor cafe tables were a enjoyable place for an afternoon drink or just a nice place to observe the canal and people walking by. The staff were tremendous from the minute we walked through the front door until the minute we left. Very helpful with directions (they provided a detailed map of Venice and a guidebook) and were very courteous and friendly. Hotel Antiche Figure will become our hotel of choice for future visits to Venice and a nice recommendation to our friends. DiMuzio Family, Beaconsfield, UK

<Content>great place great staff Had a great stay first week of april. staff before and during were very friendly and informative. The location is great, i just dont getthe gripes of some earlier reviews, i thought the view overlooking the canal was great...so there is a train station on the other side. Only gripes would be limited breakfast and the 3rd bed to make our room a triple wasnt the most comfortable in the world but everybody were agreed that they enjoyed their stay.

<Content>Easter break in Venice This was an excellent hotel for our first trip to Venice, easy to find and well located for trips to all parts. The rooms are spacious, very nicely decorated, with comfortable beds. The bathrooms appear to be newly refurbished with beautiful venetian chandeliers on the mirrors. We paid a little extra in order to have a room facing the Grand Canal which had a view of the Scalzi Bridge. We found all the staff spoke good english and were very keen to please. We would definitely recommend this hotel to all who wish to visit Venice. Gill and Steve

<Content>Excellent Location and friendly staff Lovely hotel on the Grand Canal. Staff were very welcoming and on our arrival gave us lots of useful information about places to go and what to do during our stay. Room was nicely decorated and clean, the bathroom was also very nice. The hotel was ideally situated just across the bridge from the Vaporettas which took you into the centre of the city at regular intervals.I would stay here again most definitely!

<Content>Nice Hotel We are a family of four that stayed at this hotel for two nights in March. The hotel was very clean and the staff was extremely nice. This is a great location for those that arrive by train, the hotel is right across the canal from the train station. We had a little trouble with the shower getting water all over the bathroom floor, but were very satisfied with everything else.

<Content>Warm, friendly Hotel We recently returned from our second trip to Italy, and our second stay at the Antiche Figure Hotel in Venice. The first trip, we relyed on Hotels.com to help us find a good hotel, and we were so pleased with this wonderful, little hotel.First of all, it has a fantastic location. Our first trip, we came in from Marco Polo Airport, via the bus, which dropped us off at Piazelle Roma, which is a transportation hub. We hopped a vaporetto (water bus) to find our hotel, and there it was, on the right side in full view! We got off at the first stop, Ferrovia,and walked across the bridge to the hotel. We couldn't believe that it was that convenient. It is also across the Grand Canal from the train station, which also came in handy for both of our trips to and from other cities. Remember that Venice is unlike other cities where one can hail a cab and be dropped right in front of your hotel. Their location is fantastic!As we walked trhrough the front door, we were greeted warmly by Alessandro, the hotel manager, who was very helpful in orienting us to the city of Venice, as well. During our three day stay, we were always treated like a member of the family by this warm and friendly staff. They all spoke English, too.The rooms are very pretty and comfortable. It is my understanding that the Grand Canal side rooms are larger, and that was where we stayed both visits. The bathrooms are very nice, too, with a bathtub and shower and a nice sized vanity.As I said earlier, we just returned from our second trip to Venice and a big reason for returning was the Antiche Figure. We have sent friends to stay there, as well, and I highly recommend this hotel.As a final note, I celebrated my birthday there last week and planned on a gondola ride, which Gianni, at the front desk, arranged for us. He escorted us to the gondola (again, right out in front of the hotel) and then quickly went back in to their bar and returned with an ice bucket and my favorite white wine, courtesy of the hotel! He even made me a birthday card on the hotel computer and presented it with the wine. Needless, to say, I was very touched by his thoughtfulness!

<Content>Nice hotel My husband stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in March. I selected it based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. I enjoyed my stay at the hotel but to be honest I was expecting a little bit more from the hotel based on the over the top reviews. We booked a canal view room (Room 111). It was a fairly large room with a view of the Grand Canal. It was clean  nicely decorated. The room looked just like it shows on the website. The bed we had was 2 twin beds pushed together (very normal in Europe) however the beds were not quite an equal height. The side closest to the door way was slightly lower and a bit worn. In fact the foot of the bed had a rather big indentation. I wanted to mention this to the hotel but my husband wouldn't let me (it was his side of the bed). I was just a little disappointed considering we paid 239 euros for the first night  299 euros for each of the next two nights.I want to clarify that the hotel is nice but I didn't see why the reviews are as incredible as they are. I must give props to the staff. They were very helpful when we checked in - providing us with information about the vaperatos and also when we needed a water taxi for our very early flights home. I am in no way bad mouthing this hotel as it is a nice 3 star hotel. The location is perfect for those who have lots of luggage  don't want to haul them on a vaperato or pay for a water taxi.

<Content>Perfection ! My fiance booked a trip to Venice as a surprise trip over Valentines day - he couldnt have chosen a more perfect hotel! everything about the hotel was brilliant, location, staff, the room, etc etc etc! Staff were all so friendly and took time to tell us how to get places, recommendations of restaurants etc. We werent actually aware the Carnival was on when we arrived, but the staff took their time to explain all the goings on for the duration of our stay and supplied us with maps and info on the carnival.Only a short walk from the bus station over the river and afew little bridges and we were at the hotel!The Vaparetto station directly accross from the hotel, outside the train station, was very handy, we used it loads. Worthwhile getting a pass for your duration, especially since you can jump on off anywhere, all day, and although you can walk to St Marks Square, it does take about 30mins or so, depending on the pace. But the pass gives you the option of perhaps walking there and getting the vaparetto back.We got engaged over there, and hope to return to the Antiche Figure sometime in the future, maby even for our Honeymoon!

<Content>hotel antiche figure We stayed at this hotel in March (13-17) and had a fantastic time. The staff could not have been more helpful. They booked us tickets for the Secret Itinery tour of the Doges Palace at our request over the net prior to arrival (well worth doing to avoid queues). They also booked us tickets to see a concert which was lovely and we really enjoyed a Vilvaldi concert one evening too. The location is excellant and we used our 3 day waterbus pass everywhere and felt it was good value. The weather was fab which helped, and we got a waterbus out to lido and hired bikes for an hour (which only cost 3 euros). Overall we loved the hotel. Thanks to all the staff. We loved Venice and hope to back soon. Claire and Niel

<Content>Up to expectations Having looked at the previous reviews and photographs we booked the hotel for our 35th wedding anniversary and were not disappointed. Hotel location is ideal for bus station for blue bus from airport only having to walk some 200yards and overlooks the grand canal. Staff were excellent, friendly and spoke english so well that I didn't have to try my beginners italian. Bedroom (to side of hotel) and bathroom were on the smaller side but comfy, very adequate and spotlessly clean. Nights were quiet and we slept well. Buffet breakfast was an extra to our costs but good value at 5 euros each we thought. If going for a few days only suggest that you avoid the weekend as the main tourist attractions were extremely busy then. (Too many people to enjoy the sights). Venice is a safe friendly city though and still has that special magic.

<Content>Fantastic choice; luxurious rooms with helpful staff Rooms are very luxurious by Italian standards with carpeting instead of the usual hard floors and a co-ordinated decor. Bathrooms were good size and towels were changed every day. A nice touch were the chocolates on the pillow.Breakfast was only 5 E for usual condinental buffet style which was great value.All of the staff were excellent, helpful and friendly. We had taken my father in a wheel chair ( brave in Venice!!) and found the staff very happy to store the chair etc.Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a visit to Venice. It can be reached within minutes from Piazale Roma, which is where the coaches arrive and is across the river from the railway station. The vaporetto's tend to be less crowded as this is the start of the Grand Canal, and this makes getting a good seat easier.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! We went to visit Venice in February this year for the Carnival. Aftera long but interesting train trip from Vienna, we arrived at the Hotel located opposite Santa Lucia Train Station, which was great because we did not have to carry our luggage far. Getting to the Hotel, I was very impressed by the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. These people would do anything to make sure that your stay is perfect. We had the room with a view to the Grand Canal and that was truly magical especially in the evenings! It goes without saying that the room was impeccably clean and that it lived up to the reviews that I read before making the booking. Also, the Staff recommended a very good restaurant close by. This is a truly wonderful Hotel and I look forward to returning at Antiche Figure for the next Carnival!

<Content>The Worlds Best!! My wife and I spent the first leg of our 3 month world tour honeymoon at this hotel and despite staying in some of the finest hotels in the world, I still can't find one that matches Hotel Antiche Figure.The staff are wonderful and went out of their way to make us feel right at home and even though we didn't tell them we were on our honeymoon I was beginning to wonder if somebody tipped them off as we have never been made feel more special in any other hotel.The view from our room was splendid and the location is second to none.The only reason I would hesitate in giving this hotel a five star rating is that I'd be afraid that the next time we go there we won't be able to get a room due to overwheming demand from people trying to stay there. Simply the best and we will be back as regular customers!

<Content>A good experience Returned on 16 March having spent 4 nights. The staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is very well managed.It is spotless, immaculate bed linen and good quality bath towels etc. We were on the top floor looking across to Ferovia station and up to the bridge, the views from our windows were wonderful. The bedroom temperature was just right and the rooms were very quiet considering our location. The dining rooms are a little on the small side for me, I tend not to like seeing anyone in the morning so we sat at the front beside the reception area and that was just perfect. Very lovely lady in dining area who seemed to be in charge, nothing was a bother.We are pretty fussy about our food, they recommended a place quite close by for our first meal and it was just perfect, It was called the White Well or something like that, at least it had a well in front of it. You could not be dissapointed with this hotel.

<Content>A truly wonderful hotel We have just returned from a short break in Venice. I have always used tripadvisor and it has never let me down. True to form the reports from other guests did not disappoint. What a wonderful intimate hotel in a great location. The staff were fantastic and were always so eager to please and what was encouraging is that they actively and genuinly solicit feedback and suggestions on ways to improve, however I was unable to suggest anything. Based on previous reviews I had already made my reservation through Hotels.Com but then made direct contact with the hotel to enquire about upgrading to a room on the front of the hotel overlooking the canal. Francesca responded very quickly and offered me an upgrade to a superior deluxe room at a greatly discounted rate. Upon arrival I was also then informed that this nominal upgrade would include breakfast, fantastic. I would whole heartedly recommend this hotel and we will definately return.

Decided not to pay extra for room with a view, no regrets though, room very quiet, decor lovely, comfy bed, room spotless, just as in the pictures on web. Highly recommended, wouldn't hesitate to return.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel This really is a fantastic hotel just what I was looking when arranging a romantic getaway to venice.I planned to propose to my girlfriend whilst we were away and I wanted everything to be just right, this included getting a great hotel.I couldn't have made a better choice than the Antiche Figure.I had booked through expedia a room facing the Grand Canal and emailed the hotel before my trip to see if I could get one of the rooms with the little balcony, I promptly got a reply from Alessandro who said they were both unfortunately booked. However upon our arrival we were greeted by Alessandro who remembered my earlier request and I was extremely pleased when he told us that one of these rooms with the balcony was now available( room 212).The room was immaculate in everyway with it's marble bathroom and great view of the grand canal it was just perfect.The hotels location is also great just 5mins walk from the bus station, and within easy access of the Vaparetto's.I would recommend buying a Venice card upon your arrival as it allows you to jump on and off the vaparettos as many times as you like, they are good value for money.Overall I can't recommend this hotel enough.Thanks to all the staff at the Antiche for making our stay one to remember.

<Content>Wonderful ! We booked this hotel through Lastminute.com, and had a wonderful break. The hotel was easy to find [when arriving by bus or taxi, find grand canal, turn right cross 2 bridges and you're there]. Lots of places to eat / shop nearby, nice walking distance for anywhere in Venice, but also handy for the boat bus if you're not up for the walk. We paid extra for the upgrade but I am sure all the rooms are as nice, so its all down to personal choice. Be aware that coffee/ tea making facilities are not usual in rooms in hotels in Venice and this hotel is no exception. Rooms are pristine, staff are very helpful and friendly. Venice itself is quite expensive so be warned, but it is also a unique and fabulous city, I felt quite safe walking in Venice [more so than at home] so go and enjoy,I whole heartedly recommend the Antiche figure

<Content>great-even for fussy travellers Well I think all the other reviews say it all. I have to say with such good reviews you get suspicious that the hotel is commissioning people to write reviews-but it does actually live up to its reputation! The hotel is a few minutes walk from the Piazza Roma (bus station) and there are convenient buses from the airport. It was a relief that we only had to wheel the suitcases a short distance -with only two small bridges (steps!). We had a room overlooking the canal which was magical -particularly opening the windows in the morning and seeing the buzz on the canal below. The room was beautifully decorated and of a good size. Minor gripe that the bathroom smelt a bit fusty but not because it wasn't clean as everything was spotless but more to do with the perils of shower curtains. The bed was really comfortable and this is coming from somebody who is obsessed with having proper cotton sheets and good pillows! The breakfast in the morning was great and well worth the 5euros (it costs that much for a coffee alone in some places!). It was approx 15 minute walk to St Marks Square but the walk was great-and it was nice to be away from the hectic atmosphere of the Square.Reception were really helpful with directions and recommended some great places to eat. For a special night we would definitely recommend  La Columbina-fantastic food (best steak ever!) and enthusiastic service.What more can I say-we will definitely be back!See you soon Antiche Figure!!

<Content>Quite simply the most charming romatic luxurious places in Venice My now fiancee and I stayed there for 6 nights. We had a memorable time. Everything was quite perfect. As you spot the property up a cobbled street it looks warm and inviting and even better than any of the photos on their website. The reception staff, were all very welcoming and charming - any request was met with a smile and prompt response.We stayed in a luxurious room, generously sized with a great marble tiled bathroom and very opulent. The view from our room was of a wall but did not hinder our stay as this is common of most accomodations in Venice.The breakfast (included) was as fine as you'll find in a European hotel, although advertised as an American breakfast?This has to be one of the best hotels in Venice. We'll definitely go back. The staff were so nice, they'll do everything to satisfy.

<Content>Bella Figure I happily recommend this hotel to you if you are planning a stay in Venice (at the same time envious that it is not my fortune to be returning). While not initially booking a canal side room, we did choose to upgrade when given the option on arrival. I am very glad that we did as it was a personal pleasure to awaken early to the sound of the city coming to life on the water, and to watch deliveries and commuters to and fro. We stayed for four nights at the end of February/ beginning of March. Our room was very comfortable, spotlessly clean, and prettily furnished. All of the staff members we encountered were friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was ample for our needs with a good selection of pastries, cheese, meat, eggs, fruit, cereal, juice, coffee etc. etc. The hotel is well located for arrival in Venice by train (to Santa Lucia) or by bus to the Piazzale Roma and it isn鈥檛 too much of a struggle with luggage from either. We also liked that that it was far enough away from St. Mark鈥檚 to allow us respite from the tourist throng (to which we contributed betimes), and to see a little of the more 鈥榬eal鈥?Venice, while the Basilica and the Palazzo Ducale were still perfectly accessible by waterbus, or indeed on foot, or by both means for a double perspective. Ciao! PS We booked directly via the hotel鈥檚 own nicely-designed Website which we found cheaper than other Web accommodation booking services.

<Content>Excellent value in an expensive city I stayed at the Hotel Antiche Figure at the end of February / beginning of March. The hotel is located opposite the train station, and about 5 minutes walk from the bus station. However, if you arrive by airport shuttle late at night be prepared to get lost between the bus station and the hotel.The hotel rooms are very clean and spacious, the beds are comfortable, and the bathrooms sparkling and well equipped with both bath and shower (but make sure you learn your 'C's and 'F's if you don't want a shock). The bedroom is equipped with an in room safe, basic TV stations (CNN and BBC World for English speakers) and chandalier lighting. You can pay extra for a view of the Grande Canal, however, my view of the building opposite let me know whether it was raining or not in the morning, which was important.While the hotel is 20 minutes or so from St Marks Square this does mean you have ample opportunity to explore the side alleys on the way and discover those quiet hidden 'village squares' with kids playing and locals chatting in cafes. Getting lost is a real treat in Venice, even at night. Also, being on the Grande Canal opposite the Ferrovia boat stop means there are no fewer than nine different boat routes that will take you back to the hotel (in fact every boat on the Grande Hotel stops opposite the hotel). This means you can enjoy the boat trip from St Marks Square to the hotel late at night, when Venice seems so much more peaceful. You wouldn't do this if you stayed in an expensive hotel near St Marks. You can also catch a boat direct to Murano from opposite the hotel.The hotel staff are very helpful, and can book almost any ticket for evening concerts (at no extra charge) as well as recommend excellent restaurants (usually those recommended by other visitors). The breakfast may be extra, depending on who you book with, but the buffet of rolls, orange juice, ham, cheese, yoghurts, croissants and various pastries provide an excellent start to the day (plus tea in a pot!). The foyer also has a laptop with internet access free of charge to residents.I would defintely stay here again on my next trip to VeniceFinally, don't worry, the lift floor always makes that noise when you get in.

<Content>A little cracker! Booked via [----] and flew Ryan Air from Liverpool. The return flightrequired us to be at the Bus Station @ 0710 but the location of the hotel, 5 minutes away, made this a piece of cake. This hotel shines like a new pin - a real credit to it's owners and staff. We shall return!

<Content>Bella! The Hotel Antiche Figure is a little gem in a fantastically convenient location. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay here! The hotel itself is spotlessly clean and beautifully maintained. I have stayed in numerous hotels across Europe and further afield and would say that Antiche Figure is one of my very favourites. As it is a relatively small hotel, this guarantees you the best in personal service and attention to detail. The hotel's three star rating really does not do justice to the quality of the accomodation and finishing touches.As previous reviewers have pointed out, the hotel is not in the centre of San Marco, but we saw this as a big advantage. It was far enough away to prevent us from being overcome by tourists and ripped off, but perfectly located for the bus station at Piazzale Roma, the water bus at Ferrovia and local shops and restaurants.Alessandro and his staff did everything they could to ensure that we were well looked after and comfortable. The Hotel Antiche Figure has really proved to us that 'size doesn't matter!'

<Content>Great Hotel as expected from other Reviews We have recently returned from a 3 day visit to Venice staying at the Antiche Figure, booking the hotel based on the reviews on Trip Adviser. We were not disappointed. Our room was small, but clean, tasteful  comfortable. It would have been nice to have a room overlooking the canal, but it is quite noisy with river boats running early to late at night, but that is probably the charm of Venice. The hotel is at the top of the Grand Canal near the bus station at Piazzale Roma, very convenient when arriving by bus from the airport. The staff were really friendly  helpful  we would definately stay there again. If anyone could recommend reasonably priced cafes  restaurants with good food in Venice - much appreciated as they are thin on the ground.

<Content>great hotel we booked this hotel through last minute.co. and then got in touch directly with the management who arranged an upgrade to our lovely canal view room on the 4th floor at a v good price. One of the best things about the hotel was its location- walking distance across 2 bridges approx 5 mins away from piazza roma. We got bus no 5 frm the airport to piazza roma for only 3 Eur. Did not have to drag suitcases across boats etc and through the small alleys. The 30min walk through santa croce and san polo to san marco was v atmospheric. Cannerigio and Murano were great too. We used the vaporetto to go to Murano- no 42 from opposite the hotel and no. 41 back from Murano which circumvented around Venice.The hotel staff were v helpful and gave us a map with excellent directions. The room was clean- definitely should have 4 star status. Alessandro was really friendly and check in and check out was carried out professionally. \\i

<Content>Venice Great location, short walk from airport bus at Piazza Roma (only 3 Euro/person from airport), right on the Grand Canal, close to the bridge to the train station. Hotel is clean and the bathroom is the best for all the hotels we stayed in Italy. Friendly staff, especially Johnny, and very good breakfast included in the hotel rate. Definitely will stay at Figure next time in Venice.

<Content>My "Home" in Venice This is our third stay in Venice ! 1st year in 2005 a l weekend - at another hotel very near - as rates seemed too high, we booked for my 50th birthday, a 1 week stay at what seemed most convenient, pricewise and quality wise. We were really enthusiastic with all the services provided by the hotel - Friendly help, nice and very clean rooms, very nice furniture, great bathroom, luxury I may say, and a stunning view over the GRAND CANAL- Although packed with tourists runing around at this time of the year, the hotel offers calm and peaceful nights. Breakfast is really good, lots of choices, even for the late-rising tired tourist we were (far after 10am, and no one complains, just serve you a smile and friendly words, with a good breakfast !)Access to the Web is freely provided, and so on, So, we decided once more to spend another well earned vacation week in this hotel this february 2007 - This time, we booked directly by phone two days before the Carnival started. I was most anxious, as I knew everything was full, but they managed to get us a room, great as usual. Always friendly, and helpfull is the gentlmeman at the desk - Now back to work, in La Turbie, near Monte Carlo, for another year, I'm just longing to go back to Venice and in this hotel which I strongly recommend !Daniele Cheret/M.

<Content>Fine times at the Antiche Figure Venice Spent a romantic Valentines week in Venice, and the Hotel Antiche Figure was one of the high points.We were greeted by extremely friendly and helpful staff who were able to point us in the right direction for our first trip to Venice.The hotel itself is immaculately decorated, and kept in an extemely clean condition. We chose to upgrade to a larger room with a Grand Canal view, at it was difinitely worth it! All in all, one of the best hotels I've encountered on my travels, and we have already decided we will be staying there again when we return to Venice.

<Content>Enjoyable stay My daughter and I stayed for 4 nights,we had a twin room on the 4th floor.The room was clean and well decorated and furnished to a high standard.Like the previous reviewer I have stayed in hotels all over the world and I am extremely fussy but I have no complaints about this hotel.The location is fine, I was aware it was not near St Marks Square,I did my research before I booked.The walk to the tourist sights was pleasant ,and what I expected for Venice.The staff were efficient and helpful.Breakfast was not included in my deal,but for an extra 5 euros was good value.We had a great time and I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Rip Off My wife and I stayed in Hotel Antiche Figure from 7th to 11th Feb.First impressions were that it was just adequate. It was easy to get to from piazza roma where bus depot is. Right across grand canal from large unsightly train station which is not what you want to see when you look out of your bedroom window in Venice. My room was 鈧?39(鈧?0 extra for canal view) a night plus basic breakfast. The hotel will probably dissagree but in my opinion it was basic. Now I have been in a lot of cities around europe and most hotels I have stayed in are of a much better quality for a more reasonable price. The noise levels throughout the night were overbearing, banging doors, drunken people on street, bin men empting bins etc.We asked for a restaurant recommendation and were sent down alleyways with open sewers(because of road works) and came to this dark empty restaurant beside roadworks. It was about as inviting as a morgue. We were disgusted with the restaurant recommendation by the hotel.Now this hotel is not I repeat not near St.Marks Square.Between walking to, waiting, travelling on water bus it takes about 45 mins. The hotels around St Marks Sq are a lot better value for money. They are near all the good restaurants, shops, attractions. Now I am not too particular but the restaurants around Hotel Antiche Figure are awful. Dirty, cheap furnishings, all obscure menus, ignorant staff.If you want to have a good a time as possible in Venice, stay near St.Marks Square not at Antiche Figure.Also when we were leaving we were asked was everything okay during our stay, we mentioned the noise and were told if we said something we could have swapped to another room.First of all hotel was fully booked(according to night porter) so how could we have, secondly why was a room with such bad soundproofing being rented by hotel, it should be worked on.Overall I felt it was terrible value for money and most certainly does not deserve its place as second best hotel in venice.

<Content>Great value for money My Aunt and myself stayed here for 3 nights from 4th February 2007 and were highly delighted with the hotel. I booked this hotel after reading all the marvelous write ups on this sight. Everything said is true and I cannot add any more regarding the hotel as it has all been said. We did go to the restaurant behind the hotel but found this to be a wee bit expensive and we had to wait a long time for service, they also got the meals wrong. I would recomment a further restaurant - the Al Poggio. The meals are good value for money and the Tourist menu was very good also. Go out of the hotel to the right and go over the Scalzi bridge - turn right and continue until the next bridge over the Cannaregio canal. The restarant is on your left just after the bar on the corner. I hope that you enjoy.Venice was just magical and at this time of year was not so crowded. We were able to see all the recommended sights with hardly any crowds and the weather was kind to us.

<Content>Wonderful location and Great Price!! My boyfriend (now fiancee) and I took our first trip together and stayed at the Hotel Antiche Figure Mar 06. The location is just perfect for travelers leaving Venice by train, as it is just across the canal. There are numerous, excellent, and reasonably priced restaurants and bars very near. We were lucky enough to upgrade to a room with a view of the Canal for a low price. There is a traghetto stop just across the canal! We stayed for two nights...I wish we had more time. I loved the experience!! It's very easy to find and very convenent to where the bus leaves you from the airport. Every member of the staff were so nice and eager to make your experience in Venice a pleasant one. I can't wait to return! Although early Mar was still chilly, that is the best time for travel...no flooding, and not so many tourists!

<Content>The perfect Venetian place to stay I can't recommend this fantastic little hotel enough. This was our second stay here, our first in the summer last year and most recently at the beginning of February with our parents. Both experiences were of the highest standard - where do I start?The hotel was so simple to find and incredibly convenient. It's directly opposite the train station (a very nice train station - not unsightly at all!) and just 5 minutes walk and a couple of small bridges away from the Piazzale Roma (the main bus station, connecting you to the mainland and airport). Right from the moment we arrived (we were early both times) we were greeted by Gianni who was very friendly and couldn't help us enough. We were shown immediately to our rooms. We paid extra for the canal view which I believe was definitely worth it. Room 412 on the top floor was particularly lovely. The rooms are clean and beautifully furnished in typical Venetian decor. Comfy beds, gorgeous bathroom, mini-bar, tv, hairdryer etc. Cleaned every day including little chocolates left on our pillows. Only TINY gripe was the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Having said that, you're in Venice where there are more cafes than you could shake a stick at. There's only so much caffeine one can drink! I presume that the rooms over looking the very tiny side streets are just as beautiful - it depends whether or not a room with a view is important to you. If you didn't have a great view, no matter as there's a lovely little terrace downstairs from which to sip a coffee or a glass of prosecco and watch the world go by. Breakfast was a basic continental spread (cereals, yoghurt, juice, pastries, cheese, ham, eggs, bread rolls and tea/coffee) but there was plenty of it and it was fine for setting you up for a big day of sightseeing. We were recommended a fantastic restaurant around the corner (Osteria Veccio Pozzo) which apart from the incredible fish does the BEST steak ever (surprising for a small island!). Gianni also booked for us to see a wonderful concert in a palazzo 'La Traviata - Verdi' where we moved to a different room for each of the 3 acts. Alessandro (the manager) and Elena were both really helpful and couldn't do enough to make our stay more welcome. The rest of the staff were the same (sorry, don't know names!) This really was what made this place so special. We've stayed in some amazing hotels in our time and most would need to take lessons from Alessandro and the rest of the staff! We felt welcomed and comfortable and as if nothing was too much trouble. Our parents LOVED Venice and it was made that bit more special by having such a fabulous hotel from which to be based. We never return to the same hotel as we love to visit new places but we have made an exception in this case. We're very much looking forward to staying in the new suites (which are part of the hotel) and are currently under construction - ready in April 2007 I think. Thank you Hotel Antiche Figure, can't wait til next time!

<Content>Going to Venice? Stay here! Summary: Fantastic value, very highly recommended.My sister and I accompanied my mother on her first trip to Venice, to celebrate her 80th birthday. Mum is fit but has two artificial hips and finds steps difficult. From every point of view the Antiche Figure was the perfect choice of hotel for her and us. The hotel is a five minute walk from the Piazzale Roma where the airport buses terminate, and even less from the railway station. It is very easy to find, as it looks over the canal opposite the station. It is almost at one end of the Grand Canal, so you can hop on a vaporetto and travel the length of the canal in one journey. At the same time it is not so far on foot to Rialto, with its shops and restaurants.The hotel itself is run to the highest standards. It is clean, comfortable, tastefully and appropriately decorated. We had a triple room, and whilst not large, it was adequate. The bathroom was beautiful (though I would agree with a previous reviewer that a shower screen would be an improvement). The linen was spotless, snowy and luxurious and was changed daily. The staff were all helpful and friendly and ready to help with restaurant suggestions, and other enquiries. The breakfast was varied and plentiful. The amenities it offers may warrant a 3 star grading, but their quality is well in excess of that. At the price we paid, it was amazing value.It is hard to fault the hotel. As an Englishwoman, my mother would have liked to find tea-making equipment in the room on arrival - but when in Venice....

<Content>Hotel Antiche Figure has the warmest welcome in Venice! We returned to Venice to stay at the delightful little Hotel Antiche Figure. We had our usual wonderful experience. The room was perfect. The staff is exceptional. There was nothing they would not do to make our stay perfect. They are very knowledgeable, extremely helpful and they always give everyone a very warm welcome. The location of this little gem is extremely handy to shopping, great restaurants and the various Palazzos anyone would want to visit while in Venice. There is even a Gondola stand just in front of the hotel. We travel extensively all year everywhere. This is definitely one of my favorite Boutique Hotels anywhere. They are almost always full, so one needs to book as early as possible. As we were checking out some guests were arriving early in the morning, long before check-in: we heard them say to the front desk  I am sorry we are so early and the reply was you are always welcome. This perfectly describes this elegant little hotel鈥檚 attitude towards all their guests. We will always stay there when we can.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel This is a wonderful hotel which well deserves its high ranking on Trip Advisor. It is well placed to take vaparetto number 1 from the start of the route down the grand canal. If you wait for an older vaparetto they have seating on the front unllike the newer ones.You can spend a lot more on hotels in Venice but unless you need the opulence you can't do better than here.

<Content>Excellent choice, excellent location Neither of us ever having visited Venice before, I was anxious that my husband's birthday treat should be memorable for all the right reasons! We are both regular users of all the best hotels in the world and although this time we were on a budget, we were highly impressed by the standards that the Antiche Figure offered. Don't be put off that it is only a 3 star listing! The room was spacious, clean and beautifully decorated. We paid the extra for a deluxe canal view room, which are bigger, but on the whole this was an unnecessary extravagance. (In fact, I would imagine that in the high season, it would be a disadvantage, as you are right on the street and the edge of the Grand Canal) I am fanatical about the bed, linen and bathrooms in hotels, but this was all once again well above 3star expectations. The bed was most comfortable and the linen was of superb quality and changed each day. My only reservation about the bathroom, that the shower was screened by a shower curtain (which always have an unpleasant aroma associated with them!) - Why not have a glass screen, this would have been much more fitting with the marble and the murano chandeliers! The hotel was only a 5 minute walk from the bus terminal in Piazzale Roma and surprisingly easy to find. The staff and management were extremely polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend the Antiche Figure to anybocy.Susan Ricketts

The Location was great. The hotel is located at the top of the Grand Canal directly opposite the railway station and few mins walk to the waterbus and 5 min walk from the bus station. Really good restaurants near by, the hotel staff will point you in the right direction.I will def be coming back to this hotel.

<Content>Absoluely Fabulous My boyfriend and I just got back from a 2 nights stay at the Hotel Antiche Figure (1-19  1-20) and all I can say is WOW. From the time we checked into the hotel to the time we left everything was wonderful. The rooms are very clean and beautiful decorated. I would recommend this hotel to any one. It is in a great location and easy to find and if you have ever been to Venice you know what I mean about being able to find you hotel.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel We contacted the hotel directly having read the reviews. They responded extremely promptly with a deal which included a room overlooking the Grand Canal.We were celebrating our first wedding anniversary and quite honestly we good not have chosen better. The room was beautifully laid out and very romantic. Having a view of the canal was very special and we spent time just watching out of the window. Having such a lovely room was a joy to come back to after a day out exploring. The hotel is located within easy reach of the bus station and we found it very easy to travel around Venice with many of the Water buses coming back to opposite the hotel. The reception staff could not have been more helpful and the whole package was great. This included a candle light dinner at a local restaurant which was also excellent. It included 5 courses all local fish dishes.I would highly recommend this hotel.When we return to Venice we will certainly want to stay again.Nicky Hextall

<Content>Pleasant and Clean Hotel I have to agree with all the other reviews about the location of this hotel. Less than 5 minutes walk from both the railway and bus stations and waterbuses just across the bridge.I spent the weekend there with my 13 year old son and we had a first floor room overlooking the canal. The views were terrific and being just above street level gave us a great feel of being in the thick of it. However the Water buses run through the night so if you need complete silence to sleep perhaps a room higher up or not over looking the canal would be better. But you can't have your cake and eat it and for our part the hustle and bustle was part of the overall great experience.The room was clean tidy and well equipped for a 3* Hotel - my son thought the chocolate each night on the pillow was really cool. As has been said many times the staff were friendly and helpful, even to the extent of phoning the transport department to find out what the orange travel card could be used for.We both thought the breakfast was just right, typical continental and plenty of it. The waitress was diligent in making sure everything was topped up and I thought the orange juice was fine (so full marks to the hotel for taking note of previous reviews).I would wholeheartedly recommend the hotel and should I be lucky enough to visit Venice again I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.Stuart (UK)

<Content>Believe the reviews! They are right on the money! We stayed at the Hotel Antiche Figure for our 3 days in December during our Italian Honeymoon and made the decision to book it based on the great reviews here on Tripadvisor, boy we were glad we did!The hotel is a solid 3 star with 4 star service.The hotel is located literally right in front of the train station so if your coming by train it's perfect. It's location is great as you will avoid alot of the tourist crowds, and the vaporetto stops are right there as well. The hotel was very clean and the staff was exceptional especially Alessandro, who was a tremendous help during our stay and gave us the inside info on how best to get around and what to see and what to avoid. The breakfast was quaint but good and the juices were fresh and delicious.Our room overlooked the canal and it was worth it to us. We highly recommend this hotel to all who are considering it. We will defintiely be back!!

<Content>Oh Venice! I had a wonderful time staying at the Antiche Figure. I loved the location, just a walk across the bridge, although I didn't know the bridge would have so many steps! The water taxi stop is close also to go where ever you want. Everyone there was great helping in anyway they could...in English. The rooms were small but very clean and I didn't have a problem with noise at all. Will definitely stay there on my next trip! Breakfast was alright, cappicino you could get from the machine or have it made for you which we didn't know the first morning. They also have a nice little place for outside dining right on the Grand Canal.

<Content>Fantastic!! I found this hotel on this website and the reviews were all very good. We stayed here for one night at the beginning of our honeymoon. I was a little nervous about trying to find a hotel in Venice with our luggage after a long flight. It was so easy to find, we went straight there from the airport shuttle drop off. When we first got to the hotel, the reception was very nice and helpful. Our room was probably one of the nicest I have stayed at in Europe. The furnishings were very nice. The bathroom was nice, with a very large tub and a window that opened. This hotel is a good walking distance from St. Marks, but the walk was one of our favorite parts. There were lots of cute shops, markets and restaurants on the way to all the major sights. I would stay here again if returning to Venice. Don't waste your time looking at other hotels. This hotel has it all; great location, service and price!!

<Content>Great Stay! My husband and I recently returned from a trip to Italy with a one night stay at the Hotel Antiche Figure. We loved this hotel and have nothing but wonderful things to say. Great location, great staff, clean, comfortable and just a nice place to come back to at the end of the day!It was a great plus to come out of the train station and see our hotel across the Grand Canal. After traveling all over by train it was so nice just to walk to the hotel in 5 minutes! Especially helpful in Venice. Also, the water buses are very easy to get around the city and pick up right outside the hotel across by the station. We had a great view with a small balcony in our room. We overlooked the Grand Canal and the Gondola boats outside...perfect and romantic! The city is so neat, especially at night.Our only wish was that we had longer in Venice, but we will definitely be back and when we do we'll be booking at the Hotel Antiche Figure.We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to have a nice stay in Venice. It's a good value compared to so many others that we looked at and you get great, personal service too!

<Content>Fantastic hotel, great location, easy to find and friendly and helpful staff A fantastic hotel in Venice, 3* prices, 4* interior and service. Staff are friendly, Francesca on Reception particularly helpful during our stay. Rooms are tasteful, clean and furnished to high standard, top floor (4th) have great beamed ceilings, heating and a/c with double glazed windows if you dont like the sound of church bells! Great location, just across from the train and bus station, 5 mins walk and very easy to find (which is a great start to your city break). Nice little bar in the hotel for coffee or a nightcap and a great breakfast set us up for the day. All sights are within 20 - 30 mins walking distance over the canals if you want an alternative to the vaporettos. Lots of local restaurants without tourist prices close to hand, great for exploring. Can't recommend this hotel enough. Dawn  Linda, Scotland 3rd Jan 2007

<Content>An excellent hotel Just got back from spending three nights in the hotel. On arrival we were offered an upgrade to a canal view room at a very reasonable price which we took. The hotel is very convenient to reach from the bus terminal which is useful if you are arriving in the evening as we were. The rooms were very well proportioned and comfortable. Breakfasts were adequate and the dining room was of a reasonable size. The staff were very helpful; we were given a map and advised on where to go to eat. each of the staff on duty was very helpful and spoke perfect English. I would have no hesitation in staying there again and would thoroughly recommend the hotel for anyone visiting venice. I can see why it has such a high rating on trip Advisor.

<Content>LovelyAntiche We had been to Italy before but not Venice. We selected it due to the closeness to the train station and it was on the main canal. The hotel is beautiful, wonderful view of the canal, away from the St. Marco crowds and noise but it is a wonderful walk to get to the square.Alessandro, Francesca, Gianni are the most wonderful, friendly and charming people. They were very gracious and extremely helpful. They provided us with the best place to eat on a little side street near the hotel. After returning home, all 3 helped me with finding a speical gift for my husband that I was unable to get while in Venice. They went way beyond the call of their jobs. Hotel Antiche is the only place I would ever stay when we return to Venice. One of a kind in all areas of hotel stay. The Guanti's Baltimore, Maryland USA

<Content>Excellent room and service The room was excellent, and the staff very friendly and helpful, speaking perfect English. They also arranged a doctor to visit the hotel to see our young daugther, and then also interpreted. My only observation is that you probably don't need to book a canal room as there's not a huge amount to see out of the windows. You'll enjoy the stay

<Content>Wonderful stay at Antiche Figure My wife and I stayed at the Antiche Figure for 3 nights at the beginning of December. It was our first time in Venice and we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. We chose the hotel based on the recommendations of this site and we were very happy with our selection. The staff are very helpful in all respects and went out of their way to ensure that we enjoyed our stay They made good recommendations for dinner and gave helpful travel and sightseeing advice. We had Room 211 which was a large room with a small balcony and a lovely view over the Grand Canal. It had a really nice bathroom, with marble floors, his and hers basins and even a bidet. It was also useful having a minibar fridge in the room to store small food items. Our room had a safe for any valuables.The location of the hotel is superb if you are travelling into Venice by bus. It is literally a 5 minute walk from the main bus terminal at Piazalle Roma. With its location directly opposite the Rail terminal (Ferrovia), it is easy to find after your days sightseeing. The vaporetto (water bus) is less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel and will take you to Rialto and St Marco in less than 20 and 40 minutes respectively. Its really easy to walk around Venice as it is very flat, so we appreciated Francesca's advice to only buy a vaporetto ticket for one day for 12 Euros. I thought that the breakfast was great, with cereals, fruits, cold meats, yoghurts, hard boiled eggs, biscuits and plenty more! The lady serving breakfast is very sweet (sorry I don't know her name) and helpful. It was good having access to the internet in the lobby. I would not hesitate to book this hotel again when I return to Venice. For those of you who are still thinking about whether to stay here, don't waste any more time looking elsewhere -just book here - you won't regret it.

<Content>The Grand Canal with a view This is a small hotel with character and friendly staff. The location is convenient and centralized. It sits right on the bank of the Grand Canal across from the train station. The walk to the hotel from the train station is about 150 yards over a bride of stairs (that lack a ramp or handicap access). Neither my wife nor I are handicapped, but I sure felt immobile after dragging 5 luggage bags up and over the stairs. In Venice, you apparently have to have a license to transport luggage or goods over a certain distance. Our options were to take the water Taxi across the 10 yards (I could literately throw a rock at the hotel) of water to the other side for 35 Euros or drag the luggage over the bridge. As you can tell I am still happy about it.The hotel has a small bar and breakfast area on the first floor with a public computer. Our room was on the second floor over looking the Canal. The view is great, but I would recommend a room at the back of the hotel because of the noise from the boats. The room was clean and adequate. It had a tub/shower and large sink. The lighting is poor for women, but it was clean and covered is nice grey marble. The bed was firm, but comfortable. The hotel has free DSL internet and local TV. If you like to watch movies bring your laptop because CNN World news was the only station in English. Overall I would recommend the hotel. Be clear about non-smoking requirements though.FYI: Take a taxi to Murano and don鈥檛 get strong armed into buying from a factory on the spot. Shop around for glass that you like. Once you look in enough stores and factories you will realize that there is a lot of the same stuff for varying prices. If you buy anything over 400 Euros make sure it鈥檚 real Murano glass certified by Vetro Artistico.

<Content>Relaxing Atmosphere, clean tidy and helpful A very tidy Boutique type hotel well maintained and decorated without wrecking the character of an old building. The rooms are clean and tidy and the view if you are at the front is of the Grand Canal is excellent to wake up to. (Well worth a few mores pennies/cents) .The hotel is opposite the train station (not a bad thing; it is not an 'industrial' view) and 5 minutes from it and the bus station and a two minute stroll from a Vaporeto stop. Staff are very friendly and helpful and will happily advise you where it is good to visit and perhaps more importantly what is not. I can't offer much more feedback as we were generally out all day and although breakfast was included for us we only made breakfast on one occasion as we prefer to grab something while out and about but it appeared decent as these continental buffet arrangements go (I still prefer a Venetian snack from a Street vendor myself. Make sure you get yourselves a Vapporeto (boat bus) ticket to cover the period you are there (They do 24/36/48 hour tickets etc. you can get them from the stop over the bridge next to the train station) and you can just jump on and jump off when you feel like it. They are like London buses arriving every few minutes and there are few places more than a 5 minute stroll or a 15 minute saunter from a Vapo stop.Get a good guide book (Eyewitness with the 3D maps are particularly good for the Grand Canal) and follow the advice on eateries in Venice as they are a bit variable in quality. If you like seafood head for the fish market and if you stand on the stone bridge running alongside the grand canal and look inland there is a little wooden bridge which leads to an excellent seafood restaurant (I think it is called the Antiche something or the other) for a quiet high quality meal that will not break the bank. Turbot for two I would heartily recommend with a lobster gnocchi starter or the seafood soup. Good wine list too.

<Content>Great Room, Great Service It was nice getting off the train and being right at your hotel. We were greeted by Johnny who was extremely helpful in setting up our Venice Itinerary.This part of Venice was pretty quiet, but a little far from things, but the express vapporetto made everything very convienient. I will definitely stay here again. The room was big enough and the bathroom was very spacious. Breakfast was not the best we had, but it wasn't horrible either.Thanks Johnny, see you next time.

<Content>Loved the position and the staff The Huddos. Paynesville. Victoria. AustraliaWe have returned to Australia after 6 weeks travelling overseas, we stayed at some wonderful places but our favorite place was Hotel Antiche Figure in Venice. Our stay was made so memorable by the receptionist who made us so welcome and looked after all our needs, the position right on the Grand Canal and the service. We stayed with two other couples and all agreed that we would recommend this hotel to all our friends back in Australia. The breakfast was fine and the rooms were very clean, one of our group had upgraded to a balcony room looking over the canal and l would recommend that it is well worth paying the extra for the view of all the activity that happens on the Grand Canal.

<Content>Unbelievably good I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is beautifully decorated, and a five minute walk away from the train station and bus terminal. Breakfast was not included with our acccomodation, but they have a deal with Hotels.com that offers a buffet breakfast for 鈧?. This was a great deal, it was self service, which meant unlimited coffee, tea, cereal, juices, crossaints, bread rolls, fruit, ham,cheese, yoghurts etc. It was a really fantastic experience staying here, and the staff were so helpful and friendly. Please take my advice and stay here if you are planning a trip to Venice, you really won't regret it!

<Content>A Wonderful End to a Dream Vacation! The hotel is in a beautiful historical building near the beginning of the Grand Canal. It is just a 5 minute walk from Piazzale Roma (where you first begin your journey into Venice if going by car). Remember that if you have a lot of luggage you will have to pass over two bridges with stairs to get to the hotel so pack light or bring strong arms. When compared to any other hotel in Venice, however, two bridges to cross is nothing! The hotel is within a 30 minute walk to San Marco Square and there is a really nice area with shops just around the corner from the hotel as well. The accomodations were spotless and spacious and I didn't have a Canal view room. The bathroom was beautifully done in marble and murano glass. Most importantly, service was 5 star and exceeds any Hilton, Marriott or other hotel with more stars that I have ever stayed in. 3 Star Superior? This hotel's staff sets it at a standard above the rest and deserves a 4 Star Superior in my view.

<Content>Our dream came true We had just left beautiful Tuscony to visit Venice with a group of six. Not knowing the area all that well we were so pleased to find that the Antiiche was only a short walk from car park and bus terminal. Our very freindly driver even carried that ladies bags to the motel where we were met by the most professional and helpful receptionist. She was just so delightful and really couldn't do enough for us. We had free internet access in our rooms with our own laptop. We were made welcome to drink wine that we had bought with us from Tuscony in their bar area. (No extra charge.) The rooms were excellently presented and very comfortable, the breakfast was pleasant and more than adequate. The best thing of all was the location. How central do you want to be. Three cheers to the Antiche and a very big thank you to the young lady on reception. You made our stay in Vencie a very enjoyable one.

<Content>Solid hotel for quick visit This is a solid but not spectacular hotel. The best thing about this hotel is the location. When people say it is across from the train station next to the green dome, they mean directly across the grand canal from the train station. I forgot my watch and looked out the window at the train station clock for the time. When leaving by train, just walk across the bridge, no hassle worrying about being late for the train. If getting in by bus it is a block or two walk so if your luggage has wheels, no problem. I went to the right instead of straight and to the left where the bus dropped us off and went to the side canal which is pretty big and thought it was the grand canal. Just asked where the train station was and got pointed in the right direction. If staying for a long time, there are better hotels in quieter areas on side canals. There are no real balconies where you can hang out and watch the grand canal and the windows are just a little too high to get a good view. Breakfast is plain, don't think of it as a big meal.. just enough to get you to lunch. The staff is very nice. They will only recommend two restaurants and the one in back which is accessed on the alley is cheaper and I thought it was better than the more expensive one by the first bridge which is a step up in class but harder to find. They were just puttin up their website and it wasn't in English yet but should be ready by now. If you book directly with them they will give you a better deal if you upgrade your room. The room they booked for us was too small and we upgraded to a bigger room with a canal view. If anyone makes a suggestion they try and implement it. Someone wanted internet access so they put a laptop by the front desk you can use free of charge to access your email. There are better hotels, but if you only have a few days, the location and clealiness make this a solid choice. It takes you a day to figure out the vaporeto schedule, but they start the line a block away by the bus stop so walk down there and you always get a good seat, often in the front or back rather than inside. Avoid the #1, take the #86 whenever possible and don't worry, almost every one stops at the train station to get back if you don't want to walk. As you are at the far end of town, it makes you get out and travel. We walked from here to St. Marks but only one way and takes awile. Get off at the Rialto bridge which is the most crowded stop and walk to St. Marks. Safe at night so we went there every day and night and usually got back midnight to 1am and the desk clerk didn't mind. Posting an arrow above streets telling you how to get to major areas is a big plus, I wish they did that in Rome. You never feel you are lost and always felt safe even walking around after midnight.

<Content>The best hotel After spending 3 weeks of planning for this anniversary trip and reading 100's of reviews i finally picked this hotel to stay in whilst in Venice. I was looking for 4 or 5 star hotels but none of the reviews were as good as this hotel.The staff were fluent in english and were always willing to help. The room was beautiful and the view of the canal was wonderful.On Arrival at the aiport we took a bus which costs us only 3 euros each this was dirt cheap compared to a water taxi which was 100 euros or a normal taxi which was 70 euros and the bus ride was only 15 minutes away. It stopped at one stop only which was the Santa Lucia station and from there the hotel was only a 5 minute walk.Across the hotel was the waterbus stop where we could access all areas of Venice like the Rialto Bridge, St. Marks Sqaure etc.Would recommend this hotel to everyone and anyone.Ajay Sagar - London UK

<Content>First Class Hotel We have just returned from Venice  The Antiche Figure....this is how all small hotels should be.We booked the hotel after reading reviews on this site and all was as others have wrote. The position is excellent opposite the rail station ( we were lucky enough to arrive by Orient Express) and only 25 mins walk from everywhere!The hotel is spotless and clean with polite and informative staff. From when we booked in to when we left nothing was too much trouble for Gianni, Linda and all the staff.Breakfast was good, the usual continental ham cheese eggs etc.Hotel bar as cheap as local bars, which were all charging 5euros a beer etc.Hotel recommended restraunts nearby which were good.Best restraunt was Lineadegra a modern restraunt at the bottom of Venice on the east end of Giudea Canal

<Content>Terrific hotel all-around We stayed at the Hotel Antiche Figure recently on a 10 day girls trip to Italy. We were amazed when we arrived in Venice via train and stepped outside to see our hotel directly across the Grand Canal. While dragging 65 pound suitcases over the bridge was interesting, our location was so close, we did not care. The hotel staff was friendly and courteous to us while we checked in and our room was large and tastefully decorated. We were able to book a room on the Grand Canal, which really added to the hotel's charm.The hotel staff really added to our experience in Venice. They were wonderful about making recommendations for dinner and shopping. Our favorite restaurant was a recommendation by the hotel, very close by. We liked it so much we went back for dessert the night after we ate dinner there!You cannot find a better hotel in Venice with this location, amazing rooms, friendly and helpful staff, and a good price. We would definately stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful hotel, great location I was really worried about finding a good hotel in Venice. I had heard that most of them were expensive and not always worth the cost, so when I saw the reviews on this site I thought that it was worth a try. It's easy to find if you come into Venice on the bus from the airport, which is a bonus when it is late and you are dragging your suitcase behind you! It is also a great spot from which to explore the rest of Venice.The staff are really helpful. It is great to get people on the reception desk who want to help you. The rooms are comfortable, clean and really well decorated. Next time I will spend a little bit more for a canal view without a doubt.If they recommend you eat at the Ostaria al Vecio Pozzo (literally five minutes round the corner), do! The food was amazingly good at a great price and, again, the staff were friendly and helpful.I'm already counting the days until my next trip to Venice!

<Content>Karen and John Adamthwaite, Newcastle, NSW Australia - Loved it Antiche Figure, Venice, Italy.Date 26/27October 2006.What a great hotel. We had a booking for four couples, two had booked canal view rooms and the other two normal rooms. We had just arrived off the Marco Polo Cruise and had to walk from the overseas terminal to the hotel as no transport was available so we just followed the signs to Piazzale Roma and then followed the signs to the trains station. Only took 15 minutes in total. Ten of us arrived at the hotel at 9.30am, eight were staying and the other couple we travelling from Venice to Rome by train at 1pm. On our arrival Alessandro was marvellous he allowed our other friends to leave their luggage until they left on the train and that allowed them to explore Venice for a few hours.From the moment we walked in Alessandro was only too pleased to assist us with maps and information on Venice. We stayed two nights (not enough) and that afternoon we bought a 24 hour Vaporetta ticket from across the Canal, good value. Only takes 10 minutes to get to St Mark's Square and it is an exciting way to travel around Venice, especially when you do not have much time. We also used the ticket to go over to the island of Lido, what a pretty place, it even has cars and buses.Before our arrival at the Antiche Figure I emailed them and asked if they could book the Secret Itinerary of Doge's Palace which they did so without any bother. Francesca emailed me a booking number and all we had to do was arrive there and go to the Information desk and get out tickets. This tour takes you to parts of Doge's Palace that the general tours do not take you. Well worth it. Two of us had canal view rooms, and the other two couples had the other rooms. All four rooms we great. My room was 411 and every morning I would stand at the window and look at all the traffic and goings on on the grand canal, loved it. Bathroom was huge and our bedroom was huge. It is lovely to sit out at the tables out the front of the hotel and have a few glasses of wine and just people watch.This hotel has everything, even free internet access in the lobby. How good is that., especially when internet cafes charge so much throughout Italy.This was the best hotel we stayed at during our 4 weeks away and would have no hesitation in staying there again, even if I couldn't get a canal view room. All four couples found this to be the best, not one complaint.Congragulations Alessandro, Francesca, and the lovely lady who served us our wine of an afternoon, I'm sorry I didn't get your name. Antiche Figure exceeding all our expectations and thank you for your hospitality.Karen And John Adamthwaite, Newcastle, NSW, Australia

<Content>The best hotel experience My husband and I stayed at this hotel in October 2006 for three nights, and we were blown away. It was just gorgous. Our room was on the top floor and we paid extra for Canal views and it was worth every euro! The room was big, the bed was big and comfortable, the bathroom was big and all marble and glass. The view was big, everything was just fantastic.The staff were terrific and on arrival organised a trip to the Murano Island to see glassworks. Also a gondola ride which we took in the evening - a tad expensive but worth it (E90). Very romantic and lovely to see the canals at night. The hotel also recommended some excellent restaurants. This hotel was easily the best hotel we stayed in during our European trip. I would go back there in a flash! Especially since I have absolutely fallen in love with Venice!

<Content>My fav hotel in Europe I loved this hotel. The decor was gorgeous and the room spacious  clean. After an 8 hr train ride with no airconditioning, very happy hotel was just across a bridge from the train station given we were weighed down with 25kg backpacks, a pram  2 yr old. Choice of vaporetto stops right in front of hotel made getting out  seeing the sights very easy. Front desk staff very helpful also.Exceeded my expectations  topped off a great visit to one of the coolest cities in Europe.

<Content>Spirit of Venice This hotel is excellently situated, close to the railway station all the important vaporetti stops are just over the canal. The rooms are superb, elegantly and well appointed, the staff friendly, efficient and fun. The georgeous Francesca managed my late request for the laundering of my shirts with great alacrity. It is a great place for people watching, a Birra Moretti, or Campari Soda taken on the tables outside in the evening provide an insight into the protocol of the gondoliers who operate from their well-appointed cabin on the quay. They always seem pre-booked when asked by middle-aged couples, but are, nor surprisngly, available when requested by skimpily-clad antipodean girls! C'est la vie - or the Venetian equivalent! Although a busy frontage, there is no street crime and the ambience is is one of studied insoucience.Good restaurants close by - the Ostaria Vecio Pozzo just around the corner in Corte Canal is excellent - the mussels are a treat and thr range of wines interesting.

<Content>Great value and impeccible cleanliness in a dirty city A great little hotel across the Grand Canal from the train station and about a 30 minute walk to St. Marks Square, staffed by very nice and friendly people. We had a standard room which was well furnished and maintained, and immaculately clean. Unfortunately our room looked out onto a side street with a blank wall to look at only about 5 feet from our windows. The included breakfast was standard in Italy and OK.

<Content>All we'd hoped for We chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews - and are glad we did. It was all we'd hoped for. We arrived by train and it's very reassuring to see the hotel as soon as you emerge from the Station. Venice is a maze and full of people dragging luggage over cobblestones and up and down steps, we were glad this wasn't us! The location of Antiche Figure is excellent. It's just far enough from the Station (on the other side of the Grand Canal) not to be a Station Hotel but is within easy walking or vaporetto distance to all the sights. After our forays to Piazza San Marco and the Rialto, we were glad that our hotel wasn't there! All of Venice is crowded with tourists but some parts are even worse than others. Our room was quite small, Alessandro said we could change if we wanted to but we chose to stay as, although we hadn't paid for a canal view, this room did, in fact, have a good view of the canal from the side windows. Reception were very helpful and made us feel most welcome. On arrival, hours before check-in, Alessandro took in our luggage, gave us a map and pointed out our Venice familiarisation tour via vaporetto! On his suggestion we bought a 3-day vaporetto pass which turned out ot be an excellent investment. Later he made bookings for us on the Secret Itinerary Tour at the Palazzo Ducale so we didn't have to queue. My husband and I would happily recommend Antiche Figure as THE place to stay on a trip to Venice.

<Content>Can't go wrong with Hotel Antiche Figure Everything was great about the hotel! The location was perfect for us as we were there for a pre-cruise stay. Everything is within walking distance and it's so easy to catch the water buses. Regarding the noise - If you don't leave any of the windows open, you don't hear any of the canal or street noise as all the windows are double paned. (Also the mosquitoes don't come in!!) The canal rooms are worth the upgrade as they are slightly larger than the interior rooms. Breakfast was good. There were fresh fruits, yogurt, cheese, cold cuts and bread/pastries. Can't comment on the coffee as I didn't have any. There were at least two juice selections. Hard-boiled eggs were available, but I don't recall if they served scrambled eggs or not. The selection of food is much better than some of the other hotels I stayed at in Europe from previous trips. The staff made sure that there was enough food selection for everyone.Alessandro and Francesca were extremely helpful. They answered all my e-mails promptly and even helped in getting some tickets for us. The only thing that I didn't quite understand was that when we booked 11 rooms nine months ago, 4 were for canal view rooms. When we arrived, we were informed that they had overbooked the canal view rooms the following day and wanted to know if anyone in our party was interested in moving to an interior room. One member in our party volunteered to move and in fact, he liked his second room better than the canal view room he had on the first floor! Again, this hotel is great. You will enjoy your stay there.

<Content>A great hotel and fab location Two of us stayed at the lovely hotel in July 06. It was one of the best hotels I have stayed in for a very long time. Great breakfast and great location, just fab for the train station, you dont have to go carrying bags around Venice which gets very tiring after a while. Book early though seems to get booked up quickly. It has a lovely little reception and a small outside area to have drinks and watch the world go by! Higly recommended.

<Content>Loved this beautiful hotel and its fabulous staff! Thanks to the rave reviews on TripAdvisor, I booked this hotel for our trip to Venice to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary, and were thrilled with everything about it! Our room (311) looked out over the Grand Canal, yet we did not hear any noise at night. The room itself was spacious, immaculate, with a modern bathroom (and two sinks!). The general manager, Alessandro, was absolutely terrific, the staff at the front desk, the bar, and the breakfast room could not have been more welcoming, and even the other guests were so friendly! I think we were all enjoying the hotel and the city so much, everyone was in a great mood. Most of those we spoke with identified Antiche Figure through TripAdvisor, and we all agreed this hotel is a gem! Thanks to Alessandro and his superb team!

<Content>Perfect European Experience We could not have been more pleased with our stay at this hotel. The rooms were lovely. We did upgrade to a canal view which were very bright. Since we were towards the entrance to Venice's Grand Canal, it was quite quiet at night and in the morning. The staff was excellent, always prepared to give us some honest, helpful recommendations or impeccable service.Breakfast could be taken inside or sitting along the canal edge. Again, the waitstaff were friendly and attentive.

<Content>fantastic hotel Well..what can I say? This hotel was absolutely fantastic! It was in a great location, away from the main tourist attractions, but they were easily accessiable by water taxi, which suited us better as we found st marks square very busy and could have potentially been noisy at night!The bus stop that goes to/from the airport is literally 5 minutes away, and although the railway station is oppsoite, you cannot hear any trains what so ever.The room was clean and fairly big, it felt quite luxurious.The breakfast was good and adequate.The staff were very helpful and friendly, gave us a lot of tourist information upon arrival and happy to answer any questions through out our stay.I would definately stay here again!

<Content>Beautiful, quaint hotel We enjoyed out stay at this cute little hotel. We had a blue room on the second floor with a balcony, from which we had a beautiful view. Unlike others, we didn't find it noisy at all. The location was terrific not too busy, but within easy walking distance to restaurants and shopping. We took a shuttle bus from the airport to Piazza Roma and then walked over two small bridges to the hotel. Pack lightly. We bought a three-day pass for the vaporetto and went all over Venice. What a beautiful city. When we left, to go on a cruise, we could have walked from the hotel to the free shuttle to the port, but it was raining, so we took a water taxi (60 euros). The staff at the hotel couldn't have more friendly or helpful. We would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Tremendous value in very city with too many tourists We spent 3 nights at the Antiche and would certainly recommend it. The hotel started welcoming guests on 14th Feb 2003; they state that meeting/exceeding customer expectation is their #1 priority and every member of staff adhers to this principle. Effort has been made to use traditional fittings inside to match the external facade. Our room was on the small size but it was similar to anything (3star hotel) in Paris, Rome etc We were unsure about the air conditioning on the first night and left the windows open for air - a BAD mistake due to constant noise from the canal. The only downside was breakfast - only 鈧? but not worth more. Venice is FULL of tourists - and the single experience was probably enough for us. We found 2 excellent traditional restaurants - Osteria Alba Nova (sea food) and All ANFORA Trattoria (best pizza in Venice, Europe. .. the World?). We had a single drink in Harrys Bar (鈧?6.50 for 2 Vodka and Tonics) In 45 minutes, we never saw anyone purchase a second drink!!

<Content>We really enjoyed our stay here This hotel is conveniently located across the street from the train station. Rick Steve doesn't suggest staying in this area, but I'm not sure why. We would gladly stay at this hotel on a return trip to Venice. The Vaporetto stop was just a few steps away as were plenty of restaurants and shopping. The rooms were larger than any other we had while in Italy. They were also very clean, which is of utmost importance to us. The staff was very helpful in reccomending restaurants and offering tips for our stay in Venice. We also enjoyed the outdoor tables for a late night coffee and some people watching.

<Content>Brilliant! This hotel was fantastic! We chose it because it was a reasonable price and seemed to be a good location - when you've never been before you can't be sure. It is on the Grand Canal within easy reach of the buses, trains and a vaporetto station just over the bridge.The staff were lovely - especially the poor woman doing breakfasts all by herself each morning!The only thing I would say is that if you have long hair take a hand towel with you because theirs (and this may be a Venetian thing) are just like large fabric napkins- absorb no water!

<Content>What a great place to stay! My husband and I stayed at Hotel Antiche Figure 17-20 August 2006 as a part of our 1-month European honeymoon. We arrived in the early evening and were immediately checked into our room on the 1st floor (floor 0 is street level in Europe). When we opened the door to our room we both stood there smiling ear-to-ear....it was huge! And, well appointed and comfortable and clean. Our room overlooked the Grand Canal and the walkway below so our view was amazing. I'm a light sleeper so I was a little concerned about the potential for excess noise. But the windows were well insulated and had exterior shutters too. The recommendation from the young lady at the front desk for where to have dinner could not have been better. We ended up going to that same restaurant 2 of the 3 nights we were in Venice - Trattoria Borghi (I believe). The morning breakfast was a good assortment of pastries, meats, cheeses, cafe, fruit, and juice. We enjoyed a glass of wine each evening as we sat outside and watched the sunset. *sigh* I can't wait to go back and will definitely stay at the Hotel Antiche Figure. In fact, I loved this hotel so much that I've recommended it to my new mother-in-law!

<Content>Great views and outstanding staff I would imagine it is quite hard to find a bad hotel in Venice as the city itself overtakes you with its beauty and elegance. We travelled frequently by train as we travelled through Italy so we chose this hotel as it was close to the train station. This was good because you only had to walk over the bridge of steps to get to it. However, it could be nearly impossible for disabled people unless they paid for some sort of quick transport across the canal. Although, this could be tricky throughout all of Venice anyhow. The other thing it reminds you to do is pack extra light. We had to carry ons and 1 very large suitcase that had we not been young and in shape would have probably killed us trying to get up the steps and across the bridge. The only other negative is the nearby church that rings several times in the morning. It rings pretty early too. I can't remember the times, but it rang frequently. I don't know if this a everyday occurrence or not as we were there on a Friday and Saturday night. Other than those small negatives, the hotel location, staff and room were above average. We had a Grand Canal view and a small balcony to enjoy it on. It was breathtaking, but Venice will do that to you. I'm not sure how great the rate was, but we were on the 2nd floor and had a Grand Canal view and paid $289/night.

<Content>Deserves its rating We booked our stay based on the tripadvisor rating and were not disappointed. We knew what to expect in Venice and were happy to be near the train, the vaporetto, piazza di Roma and away from San Marco. The room was nice though not large, the bed and pillows very good and the bathroom excellent. The breakfast was varied and tasty. The decor is understated and the staff was absolutely first class and without attitude.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel But SO Noisy! We stayed at this hotel for two nights. Upon arrival, we were given a Canal View room which is what we paid for on the first floor. I was concerned about the noise level since there seemed to be a lot of activity outside, but I was assured that there are no cars in Venice so it would be quiet. During the day, the view from our room was great and the location was fantastic. The people were friendly and helpful and the room was spacious. They definitely have a mold problem at least in our bathroom in room 112 in which they may want to invest in a Bleach pen. We fight mold at our house, too, but this did not seem to be in control. We returned to our room at 9:30 pm to settle in for the evening and between the foot traffic and boats on the canal, it seemed to be noisier than a freeway. In addition, people stopped at the hotel tables outside to have a drink on the canal and were not very respectful to those of us who were exhausted from a long day of sightseeing. It finally calms down after 11 pm and starts right back up at 4 am when I heard the rolling of suitcases heading toward the bus stop and the vaporetti begins again. We would have changed rooms the next evening but our flight was at 6 am from Venice airport so we knew we wouldn't need to sleep later than 4 am, so we just stuck it out. If you are a heavy sleeper and can sleep through anything, this hotel is wonderful. However, if you are a light (me) to moderate (my husband) sleeper, do not get a canal view room. You will not sleep or even rest due to the noise level.

<Content>splendid facility, staff and experience My wife and I spent three great nights at this facility, arriving via water taxi from the airport two doors from the front of the entrance. As we planned to leave Venice via train, the location was perfect to minimize navigation anxiety. As we left for Salzberg on Austrian Rail at the end of our visit, I realized the wisdom of having booked this hotel. It was so easy, all of it, from the way we were greeted, to the quality of the facility, to the friendliness of the staff.I cannot recall a nicer overall experience.Staff was always willing to assist or serve. The location was great, far from the utter chaos of the more crowded areas. We received a great recommendation for a local Venetian meal, enjoyed our breakfast in the cool of the morning outside, and after a day of walking (and you do walk in Venice) we were grateful to have a seriously strong air conditioner.Our canal-facing room, I believe it was on floor 3 , ( I am still traveled out!) was just great. The dual-glazed windows made the room, and building, completely silent. Highly recommened, for any travelers. Thanks to all who previously reviewed the site as you were on the money.patrick

<Content>Beautiful with balcony on Grand Canal! The hotel was perfect from beginning to end. The staff at the front desk were helpful and friendly. Our room was *gorgeous* and quite spacious. A little balcony overlooking the Grand Canal was the icing on the cake. The bathroom was luxurious and all the little details were great. Beautiful furniture, nice linens. The room was so comfortable and was the perfect place to come back to after a day of walking, sightseeing and enjoying. My husband and I are anxious to return and wouldn't think of staying anywhere else in Venice.

<Content>Thank you Hotel Antiche Figure We thoroughly enjoyed the Hotel Antiche Figure at the the end of our three weeks in Italy. We had a wonderful room overlooking the canal and it was fabulous. We loved looking out the window in the early morning and watching Venice go by on the canal. The staff was wonderful and always helpful to us. We saw many people trying to find their hotel with luggage in tow, and we were very grateful to be across from the train station. Using the water taxis or walking, gave us easy access to all the sites. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Venice. You will have the time of your life.

<Content>Lovely stay and highly recommended This was our first visit to Venice and we stayed at the Hotel Antiche Figure. There are so many hotels in Venice and so many reviews - and I think we read most of them before taking the plunge and booking this hotel! If you are in the same situation as we were and wondering where to stay, stop dithering and book here - you will not regret it. The majority of the reviews say it all.St Marks Square is about a half hour walk or you can catch the water bus which stops very near to the hotel. We both thought that the distance from St Marks Square was a benefit - the walk was lovely, it was quieter and the prices of everything a lot lower... Although we travelled to Venice on the ferry from Croatia (highly recommended!), we caught the train to Treviso and flew back to the UK from Treviso airport; however, for people arriving in Venice by train, being directly opposite the Railway Station makes the hotel very accessible and easy to find. When researching where to stay in Venice a recurring theme was the difficulties people had finding their hotels (particularly in the dark) and also carrying their luggage around Venice. You will not have those problems here.

<Content>Great after a long flight! My husband ,son and I spent a night here after an overnight flight from New York. We were to board a cruise the following day. The hotel was perfect for us. We took a bus from the airport to Piazza Roma and were at the hotel after a very short walk. The following morning we had another easy walk back to the Piazza to catch the bus to the ship. The hotel was clean, the bathroom wonderful and breakfast was good. I would highly recomend this hotel!

<Content>Great little hotel, with a lot of charm My family and I (6 people in total) stayed at the Antiche Figure on the night of August 30th (following our 12 night Mediterranean cruise). We chose this classy small hotel based on the glowing reviews we'd read on trip advisor.The hotel lived up to our expectations because it truly is a charming little hotel (more like a BB), dramatically located on the Grand Canal - offering breathtaking views of the Grand Canal.Our family had two rooms (#412 and #211). Both were beautifully furnished with stylish fabrics and were very spacious as far as European rooms go. They each overlooked the Grand Canal and had elegant bathrooms. The television sets are tiny (they should consider adding 25 tv's), however, we weren't there to watch tv. The tv's carried CNN News and BBC (really the only two English speaking channels available to us).The best thing about the hotel - other than its favorable canal front setting - is their personable front office staff. Elena, Franchesca and Alessandro were top notch! They were friendly, informative and helpful. Franchesca recommended a nice little restaurant to us which was located only a couple of minute stroll from the hotel (the Ostaria al Vecio Pozzo). Its nothing fancy, as its located in a small alley way, however, the food was very good and reasonably priced.One of the things we learned while dining at restaurants around the Mediterranean during our cruise is that you should expect to pay a cover charge to eat in the restaurant. Most of the cover charges ranged from 2 to 3 euros per person (that's right, it typically costed us $2.50 to $3.50 per person just to sit down in the restaurant - a ridiculous fee, but one that seemed to be standard wherever we ate). Plus, you could expect to pay a service charge of 10 to 13 percent (which we were consistently told was to pay for the restaurant ambiance and the rolls they brought us when we sat down). THEN, you are expected to leave a tip for the waitstaff! Europeans should never complain about eating in U.S. restaurants because they won't be hit with these same types of fees!The Antiche Figure has a small breakfast room where a complimentary continental breakfast is served (traditional european style continental breakfast with hams, cheeses, cereals, croissants, rolls, juices, coffee, teas, etc). Nice, but nothing fancy.Elena was very helpful in arranging a water taxi for us to go to the airport in the morning. Let me point out a few things which will be helpful to you in terms of the best ways to get around Venice from this hotel...As you know, probably the best way to explore Venice is by foot! The hotel is a 15 minute leisurely walk from the Rialto Bridge (a very overrated sightseeing attraction!). The Rialto Bridge is a 15 minute walk from San Marco Square (the major tourist attraction in Venice which was always mobbed with tourists). We had fun feeding the pigeons there and shopping in the seemingly endless glass boutiques! As previous reviews have mentioned, it is VERY EASY to find your way back through the maze of small side streets, because you simply follow the signs for Ferrazzi (not sure on the spelling of it) - which means train station. The train station is located directly across the canal from the hotel, however, you really don't hear any noise from there other than the occasional street singers/musicians who perform at the base of the steps.Franchesca advised us to take Water Taxi #1 (located only a two minute walk from the front of the hotel) in order to have a nice cruise down the Grand Canal. The water taxi ride was 5 euros per person and enabled us to go down the entire Grand Canal (we got off at San Marco Square and walked back). She also recommended that we use the services of the gondoliers located outside the front entrance of the hotel, since we wanted to experience one of Venice's famous gondola rides. The 40 minute gondola ride we opted to take cost us 100 euros (which seemed on par with what two other gondoliers near San Marco Plaza had quoted me). The gondola ride was very fun and definitely worth taking in order to experience Venice's small canals! Plus, if you take the gondola ride from the guys located in front of the hotel, you know you'll get your money's worth!The most economical way to get to Marco Polo Airport is via bus (the bus fare is only 3 euros per person from the bus terminal to the airport). The bus depot is only a five minute walk from the hotel - however, if you are dragging/carrying luggage, be advised that you have to cross two small bridges. Our family opted for the much pricier private water taxi ride (which cost us 120 euros in total) only because of the convenience of it. The water taxi picked us up right outside the hotel entrance and only took 25 minutes to get to the airport! We had lots of luggage, so it made sense to take the water taxi (despite the much higher cost). Allesandro was very helpful getting us settled into the water taxi in the morning. If you are travelling alone or with one or two other people, I would strongly advise just taking the bus. Also, please be aware that once you get to the airport via water taxi, you still have to walk about four minutes from the dock area to the airport terminal. It's a very ease walk though. When our water taxi pulled in, we were asked if we wanted help taking our luggage over to the airport. Be aware that the porters/luggage handlers were looking to charge us 4 1/2 euros per bag for this service. We quickly decided to haul our own luggage instead (the airport has small luggage carts that you can use at no extra charge).We enjoyed our stay in Venice very much. It's such a quaint little city and truly unique with its endless canal system. Like nothing you'll ever see anywhere else in the world! We all said that we'd definitely return to stay at the Antiche Figure hotel when we return to Venice. If you are looking for a hotel with more amenities (like fitness equipment, a dinner restaurant, etc), you are probably better off staying at a bigger property. However, the Antiche Figure is a great value because of its high level of personal service and great canal location (even if it is a 30 minute walk from the main tourist area of San Marco).

<Content>Beautiful, Clean and Great Location My wife and I spent three nights at this wonderful hotel in mid-August. The location is great - easy access to all areas of interest, including restaurants and water transport. Can easily walk to quaint areas that are 'off the beaten path' - and not get too lost!!Rooms are extremely clean and spacious. All staff very helpful and pleasant.It was a joy to stay here and we would definitely do so again should we be fortunate to return to visit Venice.Daljit  DolareToronto

<Content>Hotel Antiche Figure is the place to stay!! The Hotel Antiche Figure is a small lovely hotel with a great location at a quieter end of the Grand Canal and perfectly located to take the vaparetto to go where ever you want (get a 3 day pass and you save money). I don't think you could find a lovelier hotel with rooms facing the Grand Canal even if you were to spend mega dollars. The fact that you look across at the unattractive train station is mediated by having a room that faces the Grand Canal and seeing all the action that takes place on the Canal. The airconditioning is excellent.The major downside is that there is no internet available in the hotel and the internet cafe has unbearably slow processing which really means no internet while you are in Venice. We just returned from staying there 7 nights and were delighted to be there. All of the staff is delightful. The breakfast is adequate (5 Euro when you book with Expedia) but there is nothing hot like eggs or really good Italian cheese, etc. Take your food to the outside tables overlooking the canals! We were thrilled to have chosen this hotel!A trip advisor member, Los Angeles, CA.

<Content>We Loved This Hotel The location was great as we arrived by ferry from Greece and left by train. The area around the hotel is wonderful. We did walk to St Mark's Square one day and walked straight through and onto a water taxi to go back!. We knew Venice would be crowded and hot in August but we had no choice but to travel then. I wish we had just stayed near the hotel and wandered.The management was very helpful when we checked in. They had tickets to the Vivaldi concert I wanted to see. Our rooms were clean and nicely decorated. I felt we had more space than in some hotels. There was even a tub! Our rooms looked out onto a small street but we hadn't asked for a view. There was no issue with noise.The breakfast was pretty standard Italian. We asked for espresso and had it served promptly even though the one server was VERY busy. I do agree about the fake juice but it seems freshly squeezed juice is less common in Italy than in North America. We had the pleasant option of eating outside right beside the grand canal.

<Content>Loved Antiche Figure I have just returned from 4 night stay with teenage son. Our first time to Venice, and booked this hotel based on previous reviews. This is a fabulous hotel with a great location and wonderful staff. Venice is absolutley unique! The hotels have to be unique too. This hotel is wonderfully located at the top of the Grand Canal. It says it is in a residential area, however you are a minute away from a fabulous restaurant as recommended by Alessandros, or a pizzeria, or a bar, or numerous other restaurants, or shops...This is a beautifully appointed hotel from which to explore Venice. You are 2 bridges, 5 minutes walk from the bus staion that will bring you in from Marco Polo or Treviso, or just across the canal is the railway station with its elegant front, buskers and stalls. I never saw or heard a train the whole time and we had a canal view room!The breakfasts at 5 euros are a bargain! Rolls, coffees, juices, cereals, yoghurts, cheese, ham.. Across the road you would pay 8 euoros for less in a cafe.Our room was spotlessly clean, air conditioning, safe.Without anty hesitation I would recommend this hotel and its wondrful staff, and will be coming back again to stay.

<Content>Fabulous hotel Fantastic little hotel. It was convenient for all forms of transport. In a vibrant, yet not too noisy part of the city. Hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Any requests were dealt with immediately. Hotel itself was extremely clean, well decorated and comfortable. Room wasn't oversized, but big enough and very pleasant. Breakfast at 5 euros was a bargain! Best way of getting to  from hotel from airport is by land bus. Comfortable, air-conditioned, takes 15 to 20 minutes and only costs 3 euros each. Do not be swayed by the ticket seller at the airport that the water bus is best, it isn't! We went by water bus, it took two hours, crowded, hot, had to change at San Marco and cost 16 euros each!! We had two excellent meals at L'Incontro, Rio Tera Canal. Just 15 minutes stroll from the hotel. Reasonably priced, excellent food, excellent service, great atmosphere. Bad meal at Il Brandisi, Palazza Labia. Poor service, expensive, food okay. Would definately stay here again, would recommend for any group or family. Venice felt very safe. Best to just 'get lost' in the little alleyways, you come across some great little squares, cafe's and shops that way. Enjoy!!!

<Author>Grumpathome
<Content>Perfect small hotel on the Grand Canal with great customer service! I am going to sum up this review first, then if it still interests you, you can read the rest: : If you are looking for a Big American style hotel - then Antiche Figure is not for you. But if you want a charming boutique style hotel with clean comfortable accomodations, the charm of Venice, Murano glass fixtures, a great location to explore Venice from and incredibly friendly customer service (with excellant English) then the Antiche Figure is for you !I need to start by telling you about booking our rooms. I read all the reviews in TA before emailing Antiche Figure - all the reviews that raved about this hotel were right. Customer service began with the emails we exchanged. I was booking rooms for 10 people and was trying to make everyone happy, Antiche Figure did. Not only did Alessandro answer all my questions about the hotel and its' accommodations, but he answered lots of questions about Venice. He could not have been any more helpful! Also check out their website for lots of pictures and their email address.My family stayed here in the middle of July after a cruise ending in Venice. We had 4 rooms, (3 doubles and one quad). They were all nicely decorated, with comfortable beds (they even have kings), very clean, with working air conditioning, nice bathrooms and a fridge ( it was stocked, but we were told we could move stuff to make room for our water bottles). The hotel is wonderful, in a wonderful location, especially if you want to get away from the noise and tourists around San Marco. There is even a lovely patio with tables in front of the hotel where you can sit and enjoy the gondolas etc. on the Grand Canal.It is a 5 min. walk from Piazzale Roma ( we had a lot of luggage, but were able to to get over the two walking bridges with a little extra effort - it is still easier to walk to the Antiche Figure than to get to most hotels in Venice. You can also leave your luggage at the P. Roma where there is a boat that will deliver it to the hotel for several Euros a bag - but the walk was not too bad. The hotel is also across the canal from the train station. It is also near a waterbus stopWe went to the hotel to check it out on our first day in Venice ( we had one night on ship and then disembarked the next morning). Alessandro helped us with maps, directions, suggestions about where to go and where to get lunch - and we weren't even checking in until the next day. We arrived the next morning around 8:30 AM (the ships gets you off early) with at least 24 bags, since it was still early and the rooms were not ready, Alessandro helped us stack all our bags next to the desk in the lobby, this is a small hotel with a small lobby so we took up a lot of space. He arranged a free taxi to take us to a glass factory in Murano. The factory and showroom were great and not high pressure, but I decided to keep looking at other shops, so I passed on purchasing a bowl that I liked, since I thought we might see something similar for less money elsewhere. We shopped some more in Murano, then took a waterbus back. I had not found anything I liked better and regretted not buying it and told Francesca about it at the front desk, she offered to get another water taxi to take me back to the glass factory, but since it was late, I did not want to do that, she called the factory for me, found out which salesman had helped me, I talked to him and with some faxing back and forth, I was able to order my murano glass and have it shipped to the USA. ( he had quoted me a price before we left that morning - he remembered the bowl as the one he was trying to give to me....) this was another example of how helpful and nice they are at AF! When we returned, all our bags were in the right rooms - a real feat, since most ot them had the same last name. That evening we were able to walk from AF to the Ponte Vecchio in about 15 - 20 mins. with lots of shopping and browsing on the way. To get to San Marco, you can waterbus or walk it in about 30 mins. Walking in Venice is a must! Lots of interesting little streets, but signs on the corner of building to point you in the right direction. The breakfast is served in two small rooms and was a nice little buffet with enough choices to fill you up. Everything was fresh and nicely displayed.Overall we could not have picked a better place to end our cruise of the Mediterranean and we will go back! Kudos to Alessandro and Francesca for all their help!

<Content>Right on the Grande Canal We arrived in Venice early in the morning after a Ryanair flight from Rome ($4.95 on-line sale- see more below). The flight goes into Treviso Airport, so you have a 5 Euro, 45 minute bus ride to the Piazza Roma in Venice. As noted in other reviews, the Antiche Figure is a quick 5 minute walk from the bus station, although I will note that you do have to carry your bags over two bridges. Our room was not yet ready, but reception was very accomidating and took care of our bags and gave us maps and hints to start our exploration of the area. When we returned mid afternoon, our room was ready, on the top floor in the corner, so we had three windows overlooking the Grande Canal. No balcony, but the view was really neat. The room was very, very nice. One quirky thing I had never seen before was a key card slot near the door to operate the lights in the room. They had not told us about that at check in, and we could not at first figure out why the light in the room did not work. Then I saw the key slot on the wall by the door, inserted my room key and all the lights came on. We had planned to get a waterbus pass for our time in Venice, but after that first day we realized with a good map, knowing your primary end destination (i.e. San Marco) and willing to make a few wrong turns, you can travel the city pretty well on foot, so we skipped the water bus passes. Venice streets were very crowed, but it appeared that so were the water busses. I did not give this hotel an excellent rating, as my wife and I agreed that the breakfast, which was included, was only so so. The juice was only red juice, the coffee came from a push button machine and was not very good, and the food selection was pretty bland. Breakfast did not compare favorably at all to the other places we stayed in Italy during out trip. We took a gondola ride from one of the boats right in front of the hotel. We went about 5 o'clock and they were not particularly busy. It was 80 euro for 40 minutes or 120 euros for an hour. He showed us on a map what the difference was, and we did the hour. Even though they start in the Grande Canal, you soon get off the busy routes and into the smaller, more intimate canals. Our gondalier was pleasant, informative and made our ride very memorable. I had read horror stories about grouchy operators, but when we noticed the lines of people waiting near St Marks for rides, it was no wonder. Our operator said that he knows that he could make more money if he took over his father's permit at St. Marks, but he prefers to take life a little slower.RyanAir- By taking a 7 a.m. flight to Venice we were at our hotel by 9:30 a.m. vs. a 6 hour drive in the car. For others in the U.S., RyanAir is like Southwest without the frills(?). They are full size jets, but fly from regional airports. You take a bus from the terminal to your jet on the tarmac. I had never heard of them, but would not hesitate to fly them again if I needed an economy flight.

<Content>OK but a couple of niggles... We were very excited about this hotel and whilst it was good it wasn't as good as we were expecting. We paid for the deluxe canal view, just under 拢150 a night and stayed 2 nights. The staff were helpful and gave us a choice of 2 rooms, we chose the top floor as it would be quieter which I have to say it was very quiet. The view was ok but not as good as the pictures from another visitor on here. We looked directly over the train station but could see down the canal if we leant out the window, not something you do all the time though and the train station isn't really picturesque. The location was ideal for when you arrive and leave Venice as its so close to the bus and train station but when you're out and about it is really at the opposite end of where the action is, however, the water bus stop is right opposite so it's not a big deal and it's quite nice to travel up and down the canal on the bus. The rooms were large and clean but the bathroom had mould, it wasn't bad but I was surprised by that for a 拢150 a night deluxe room. Also the breakfasts were raved about in previous reviews, again I was a bit surprised to see that it was a self service, coffee from a vending machine and pre-packaged muffins and yoghurts with a few slices of cheese and ham thrown in. Overall it wasn't a bad hotel at all and not one to complain about but I definitely expected more following these reviews so was left feeling a bit disappointed and probably wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Exceptional Antiche Figure We had read many reviews of the Antiche Figure before going, so it had a lot to live up to!! We were delighted with our four night stay. Venice was absolutely wonderful....but tiring...and our beautiful top floor, canal facing room was a joy to return to. It was explained to us that the owner could afford to be lavish when furnishing and decorating..so all the decore is of a wonderful standard...beyond what one would expect of a 3* hotel. Other reviewers major on great location, cleanliness, really helpful service...and all we can do is confirm what they have said. Before going I e-mailed a couple of requests / queries and they were dealt with in a very friendly and efficient way. Whilst there, we requested that breakfast be bagged up for us one morning as we intended to walk to the Rialto and St. Mark's at 6 o clock!! This was sorted out in the same helpful way. Would recommend the Antiche Figure wholeheartedly.

<Content>made reservations months in advance and they "overbooked" this is the hotel i was most excited about while visiting italy because of all the fabulous reviews on trip advisor. i booked my room months in advance. however, when we arrived, they told us that there was a mistake and they were overbooked. they put us up in a more expensive hotel and assured us it was better...well it was a hotel rated #155 on trip advisor and it was not great.......i was very dissapointed. so if you decide to book a room here...be prepared to be sent to another hotel.

<Content>Absolutely Wonderful We stayed at the Antiche Figure for three nights at the end of July 2006. Our stay was absolutely wonderful. Everyone at the hotel was very, very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. The hotel was very pretty and the view over the canal was outstanding. The location is very convenient to the train station. It's all been said in other reviews. All-in-all, completely deserving of it's great rating. We would stay there again in a second.

<Content>A perfect location in a wonderful city! The Hotel Antiche lives up to all of the positive reviews that have been written abuot it.The main advantage as far as I am concerned is its location right on the Grand Canal directly opposite the Santa Lucia railway station and within 100 metres or so of the main (only!) bus station.When you arrive in Venice the vast majority of travellers will arrive at one of these two locations. Then you are set loose into the MAZE that is Venice!When you witness the poor travellers who go round in circles trying to find their hotel, it is comforting to have a hotel that is located in such fine position. As for the accomodation itself, it has all been said previously.

<Content>Worthy of the high ratings given here Superior experience at this hotel. Great location (you can see it from the train station). Modern, clean rooms, bathroom especially nice. Good breakfasts. Good air conditioning.Best part about this hotel was the staff, though. Very helpful, recommended restaurants (that were exceptional, and not touristy), gave directions, just generally went out of their way to provide a great experience.Stayed here with my two teen-age daughters. They loved it, too.And we chose this hotel based on prior ratings at this site. Lived up to the billing---

<Content>Our whole family loved it Our family (10 of us, 4 rooms) stayed overnight after a cruise which ended in Venice. The staff was outstanding, esp. Alessandro, who helped us with specific information on taxis, getting to the airport, walking or riding to San Marco, and also out to Murano. They can arrange for a water taxi directly to a Murano glass factory, which had OUTSTANDING glass. We were in room 311, facing the canal, which was surprisingly quiet. It is directly across the canal from the train station (very convenient). We had two young children in our room, but we still had a king (they may call it a double if you ask), and two twins, with still plenty of room. Two huge windows open onto the canal, and this floor has high ceilings, so it felt quite spacious. The bath was quite large as well, with 2 sinks, tub/shower, toilet and bidet, and the air conditioning actually works (unlike some of our rooms in Europe). The rest of my family had smaller rooms, since they were not quads, but still nice. We all agreed we would stay here again

<Content>Great Hotel The hotel is beautiful and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The location is good but beware if you are travelling with lots of luggage as there are two bridges you have to cross. The breakfasts were good and included in the price. Overall a great hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Place to Stay!! Just need to say what a wonderful place this was to stay. It was our first stop in Europe, and after missing a connection, our luggage being lost...I can't think of a warmer welcome. The service was extraordinary!!! The rooms were beautiful, I would however recommend getting the blue rooms overlooking the canal. We decided too late and they were all booked. The red rooms are small but certainly very well appointed. I hope to return to Venice when I can take more time enjoying the sites rather than looking for clothes...there is something magical about this city and about Hotel Antiche Figure.

<Content>Fabulous oasis on the Grande Canal We had just disembarked from a cruise liner in the port of Naples, en route to our home in Ireland. We found the hotel a short stroll from the bus station, just under 5 minutes ,and directly opposite the rail station. When we entered reception we were most courteously welcomed. The receptionist immediately suggested we should deposit our luggage and set off to enjoy Venice. His suggestions for local walking, water bus tours and travel routes were enormously practical and helpful . Our room, Canal View was very well appointed well soundproofed and air conditioned it was exceedingly comfortable. Breakfast was fresh and delicious. We were so pleased with our one night stay that we intend to return in the Autumn for a mid week break.

<Content>Great Hotel Great Location We stayed one night in room 411 which is the perfect room with a wonderful view of the Grand Canal. The location is amazing if you travel by train. When we got out of the train station like all tourist first time in a new city had no idea where the hotel was located on the Grand Canal, I was on my way to ask a police officer when I noticed my shoe needed to be tied, I bent down to tie the shoe and looked across the canal and there is was Hotel Antiche Figure. Across the bridge, to the right and into the hotel. All the help was helpful in giving us ideas to see Venice, the $5.00 a piece brekfast was well worth the cost, we recommend this hotel highly.

<Content>Best ever and clean and the staff was excellent! We stayed here in July for 4 nights, when checking in Alesandro was very friendly and very helpful as well as all the staff here. The airlines had lost our luggage in Rome and this was our 4th night in Italy with no luggage, we were traveling with our 2 kids also. The staff here was very helpful in calling the airport and helping us out with this situation as well as giving recommndations on where to go and visit, shop for clothes, which we had none, and food great dining. Cute local place we enjoyed and even watched the world cup soccer game was Eclipse. Very good and great place to mingle with some locals. The Breakfast was plentiful and again the staff very pleasant and always had a smile on their face. We were late to breakfast one morning and they still with a smile let us sit and eat. This Hotel is right on the Grand Canal and close to the train if traveling from another city which we did. Our room was beautiful with double sinks in the bathroom and overlooked right onto the Canal with our big double bed and two single beds, the room was large enough to walk around. Our children were with us ages 10 and 12 and they also loved this place. Gondola's right ouside our window, very romantic. I would highly recommned this hotel to anyone, as I love hotels and this is by far better than the 3 stars it gets. Enjoy we did!

<Content>Great hotel, unforgettable stay Date: 9-10 July 2006.Our family of four (two teenagers) stayed at the hotel for two magnificent nights. We were given a huge quadrable room facing the Grand Canal. The hotel is just opposite the train station and across the bridge. Travel light since all bridges in Venice are made of steps. The room was spotlesly clean, with a very good bathroom, a huge queen bed and two singles. Excellent decoration and a very effective air-conditioning (a must in Venice's humidity). The staff very friendly and helpful. Good breakfast and possibility to have it outside near the canal. The same with a drink from the bar. The bar of the hotel is, supprisingly, cheaper than most cafeterias and bars in the city and definitely with a better view.

<Content>Absolutely wonderful We have just returned from a 6 night stay with friends (Woodley). After our visit last year we made a promise to return, not only to Venice, but to The Hotel Antiche Figure. All of the staff were helpful and very informative. Being situated opposite the railway station makes the hotel ideally appointed, as it is not right in the middle of all that goes on! however you will not be disappointed as life seems to carry on throughout the night, but after a few beers and a very good malt you won't hear a thing.The standard of the hotel cannot be faulted, it is clean, the rooms are of a generous size, and I would thoroughly recommend spending that little bit extra to book the rooms overlooking the Grand Canal, You will NOT be disappointed!If I was pressed to make any complaint it would only be that tea making facilities would be a bonus. I suppose only an Englishman could make such a comment, but that first cup in the morning reallly needs to be before breakfast!!And do please ask the hotels advice with regards as to where to eat, you will not be disappointed and you will not be ripped off as you could well be if you are attracted by the bright lights of the canal and the persuavive patter of some of the other restaurants close by!Enjoy your stay at the Hotel Antich Figure, perhaps we might meet you there as we will bet returning.

<Content>Fantastic We have just returned from 6 days at the Hotel Antiche Figure in Venice. Friends had warned us not to return to the same place/hotel (we first stayed there last year and liked it so much that we had booked again for this year) as they are never as good as you remember - they could not have been more wrong. This time we had booked the rooms overlooking the Grand Canal and it was worth every penny. In addition, the hotel and the staff were just as good as we remembered, if not better.The hotel is ideally situated right on the Grand Canal close to all facilities, bridge, train, bus (water and auto), water taxi and gondola stations are all within easy reach. A lot of hotels claim to be on the canal, which they are, but not the Grand Canal, so be careful.The Hotel Antiche Figure provides an excellent continental spread at breakfast time and although they do not provide evening meals this is not a problem as there are plenty of excellent restaurants close by, but be sure to ask the staff which they recommend, and be sure to follow their advice.

<Content>Beautiful hotel with exemplary staff Selected based on reviews posted here. Enjoyed my stay in Venice and this hotel was a big reason.The city can be a little overwhelming when you get off the bus in the Piazzale Roma with large luggage. Thankfully the hotel is a quick walk - there are two little bridges, but overall easier than having to take a water bus/taxi.The hotel itself is nicely decorated, extremely clean, and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. You are right on the canal, and directly across the bridge from a vaparetto stop. If course, it's fun to wander through the streets and see where you end up.Breakfast is a great value and the recommendations for dinner were spot-on. I will definitely be staying here again on my return to Venice.

<Content>Super staff made my stay ! This small hotel has the most accomadating staff I have ever encounterd. Helped with taxi, water taxi reservations, let me check in early and stay late etc. I stayed there on both ends of a cruise.Rooms are fine. Excellent A/C. Rooms have safe, reasonable mini-bar, CNN.Bar is expensive. Neighbood is not the best but perfectly safe. Close to transportation-train, boats etc. But beware if you have lots of luggage. You have to cross two bridges with many steps to get there from Piazza Roma (buses) and one steep bridge from the train station. It was hard with two big suitcases.I would stay there again.

<Content>Loved the City. Loved the Hotel. We have just returned from a wonderful weekend break in Venice. What a magical place. Loved the City. Loved the Hotel. We arrived late at night (after a 2hr delay), and received a lovely warm welcome and within minutes of checking in, were directed to a lovely local restaurant, which even though it was late, was still buzzing - an excellent recommendation. Our room was delightful, spotlessly clean and overlooked the Canal as requested. The staff were all so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. We enjoyed breakfast outside and early/late evening drinks watching the world go by. The location was great, with access to the vaporettas, on the other side of the canal. It was a totally relaxing and stress free break and we would definitely go back and stay there again.

<Content>Simply The Best! Our family of 5 started our vacation in Italy at the Antiche Figure and it was our BEST memory, even comparing to the Hillton in Rome. The entire staff welcomes you every time you come or go while there. They were the friendliest and most helpful staff in Italy. The hotel is small but looked brand new to us. We were blessed to have the two balcony rooms overlooking the canal-unbelievable sights  sounds! We closed our windows at night so had no trouble with insects. We found the location to be great too. Everywhere in Venice is a great location. The vaporettos whisked us quickly to the Rialto and St Marks. We spent too little time in Venice. With another day we would have sat at a cafe all day and simply enjoyed the Canal. We would not go to Florence again but Venice will be our number one stop in Italy.

<Content>We will come again With some trepidation we arrived at the AF with our 2 friends early in a 5 week combined 30th wedding anniversay European tour. Would our friends find the hotel OK after assuring them that all my research said it would be? It was and they did! In fact it was much better than 'OK' and truly deserves its high Trip Advisor rating. Arriving by train and with 5 weeks worth of luggage including formal wear for the upcoming Mediterranean cruise, our only surprise was the steps on the bridge that separates the hotel and the station. We had imagined a smooth surface to glide the wheels over and had to carry them. Over 3 nights we stayed in the canal view rooms and smaller ones down the side. All have fairly recently been fitted out, and were clean. The welcome by John was friendly and the restaurant recommendation excellent. The female party members' already high estimation of the hotel climbed even higher when they met Alessandro next day - so charming, so handsome, so helpful! Location was fine and we walked or vaporettoed everywhere.

<Content>Great Hotel - Glad we took your advice ! We stayed at the Hotel AF for 4 nights at the beginning of June 2006 (2 adults + teenage son) and we can highly recommend it. The hotel itself is small but spotlessly clean with very hard working staff who make you feel very welcome. We met Alessandro the manager and Francesa who gave us lots of advice to make our trip enjoyable. We had an excellant room (211) with a large double and a single bed, large marble bathroom and small balcony. We really enjoyed watching the world go by from the balcony - either standing on it or sitting in our room at the open balcony door with our feet up after a hard days sight seeing. The mini bar prices for water (2 euro) beer (4 euro) were about 80 cents higher than in shops but a cold beer in the comfort of your own room was worth it. We saw other hotels that we had been tempted to book but were very relieved that we hadn't as none of them had a prime spot on the grand canal like the AF, so our advice is to look no further than this hotel. It's location by the bus / train stations is ideal and despite being on the canal side once the shutters were closed at night there was no noise preventing a good nights sleep - especially after a lovely hot chocolate in the bar.We booked direct through the hotel's web site having checked tripadvisor reviews and exchanged friendly emails with Gianni before our visit. Breakfast was very good and at busy times guests sat in the bar area or outside to eat and the staff worked very hard to keep up with demand (and always with a smile).Our favourite restaurant was Marciana, in Calle Lunga Chioverette. Turn right out of the hotel walk to the Scalzi bridge; do not cross the bridge but turn right again at the bridge and it is the second restaurant on the right. The waiter Leon was very friendly and amusing and I had a complimentary cocktail for my birthday.Top tips.When arriving at the airport, do not stand in a long queue / line at the window marked public transport, but walk past to the tourist information desk where without waiting we bought bus tickets to Venice (the No 5 at 2 euros) and a three day vaporetto pass that will take you anywhere on the water as often as you like. Gondolas extra (but you have to do it!!). Outside hotel the price was 80 euros.Forget Murano and the Lido!!!DO visit Burano with it's pretty painted houses.DO book the secret tour of the Doges Palace through the hotel. You will miss very long queues and actually see far more of the palace!Wandering around Venice can be a challenge, but DO try it. Many Calles end in a canal with no bridge or a dead end. You will make friends with other lost souls. Just follow the signs to 'Ferrovia' and you WILL be fine.We have never written a review before, but on this occasion felt we had to join others in recommending this lovely hotel and say thank you for the advice from other reviewers.

<Content>Wonderful hotel Had a fabulous stay here for the nights of 5th-8th June. We chose this hotel on the basis of the reviews on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed. Our room overlooking the canal was large and comfortable with a fabulous bathroom. Everything was spotless and the staff were really friendly. This was our first trip away on our own for 11 years. Thanks to the previous review we now know that we can book a triple room next time and return with our son.

<Content>Wonderful location What a wonderful hotel...the whole experience was great, from check-in to check-out..... The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful with great information. I cannot say enough about the room. It was absolutely spotless, tastefully decorated and the bathroom was enormous. For the small added charge, the breakfast each morning was delightful. The location was excellent, quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of St. Mark's square, but still very convenient to all attractions. The water bus stop was a very short walk away....I would hightly recomment this hotel and can hardly wait for a return visit......

<Content>Perfection! We stayed at the Hotel Antiche Figure on May 24th and 25th and I must say it far surpassed our expectations. We were on a two week trip through Italy, and this hotel was definitely the highlight. The rooms were beautifully decorated and immaculate. The staff were friendly and always helpful. The breakfast was the best of all the hotels we visited on our trip. The location of this hotel is perfect. If you arrive by train, you will see it accross the canal as soon as you step out of the train station and take in the beauty of Venice. I look forward to staying at this hotel again and again.

<Content>Absolute Perfection!!! we stayed at the beautiful Antiche Figure Hotel for 2 nights, May 23 and 24. I had been so excited to stay at this hotel, and was not disappointed! The room was simply gorgeous,large, beautifully furnished in venetion period style, and even had a murano glass chandelier over the king bed, as well as 3 murano glass sconces in the marble bathroom.We had a canal view room on the third floor, with a lovely view of the bridge nearby, and the parade of gondolas and various other boats of every kind below. The hotel provided nightly turndown service, with lemoncello candies on our pillow, and the even laid out our jammies! (I thought that was a nice touch!) The breakfast was good, much like our other hotels in Italy, coffee, juice, yogurt, pastries, croissants, ham, cheese, cereals, etc.The location couldn't be better, over the bridge, across the canal from the train stationwhere we arrived from, easily spotted from the station, and a 5 minute easy walk to theairport bus station, (tickets only 3 euro, don't waste money on a water taxi!) Close to a variety of restaurants, shopping, etc. A great experiance!

<Content>A trip to remember! We have just returned from a four day break, staying at the antiche figure. It was a surprise gift for my 40th birthday, from my husband, and he had requested a balcony if possible. I was delighted to be told on arrival that we were allocated a room with a 15th century balcony for my special birthday!!!!! Our room, overlooking the grand canal was beautiful. huge bed, lovely bathroom and so clean! They even left us a sweet on our pillow each evening! The staff were genuinely friendly and helpful, and nothing is too much trouble. They are keen to know your thoughts and how they can improve things but we couldn't give them an answer on that one because there is nothing to improve!! The only thing i would say is if they offer you a complimentary visit to Murano, and the glass factory, be warned...!! The water taxi ride is great but unless you have 拢拢拢拢拢's to spend on the very beautiful, but very expensive glass, they are not interested in you once you get to the factory!!!!! We politely left, once it was clear to the hard sales staff that we were not going to purchase, and walked around independently, then caught another vaparetto to Burano, which is well worth a visit!!We had a fabulous and very memorable time and would return to the hotel antiche figure without a second thought! It may not be the largest, grandest hotel in Venice, but if you want to feel that they really care about making your holiday special, then this is the place to go!!!

<Content>Small but perfectly formed We have recently returned from a 4 day break in Venice with friends to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. The hotel was lovely. Very accessible from the bus station and the train station and very easy to stroll to the main tourist sights. Staff were very helpful, rooms were beautiful, excellent bathrooms and the most comfortable beds. Breakfast was self service but as much as you wanted and a good variety of choices. The staff kept the bar open if we wanted it and booked us a beautiful restaurant for our last evening. All in all could not have asked for better. Would recommend wholeheartedly.

<Content>Excellent location for Venice Stayed three nights with my wife for our 25th anniversary. It was away from the hustle of San Marco and Rialto but right by two water taxi stops. Great spot for arriving and departing Venice. It is just across from the train station and about 7 minutes walk from the bus station(rode bus to airport). I don't know if I could find other hotels that were farther into town as this wa our first visit to Venice.The hotel staff was superior. Provided all the useful help about what to see and how to get there. Breakfast was super! The room was large and the bathroom was the largest we had while in Italy.I don't know whatelse we could have asked for from a hotel. We were very pleased with the price, room, service and value we received. We were treated extremely well by everyone. We would stay here again and would highly reccomend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Excellent Location! My husband and I stayed at the Antiche Figure for three nights in early May. Our room was on the first floor (one above street level) , was quite large and overlooked the canal. It's a busy location, so if you don't like street noise (voices, laughter, gondolas - no cars!) ask for a room either higher up or off the canal. The location across the canal from the train station was great - except for lugging our bags up the bridge stairs. Oh well. The staff was great - Francesca especially. Breakfast was fine, except for the coffee from the automatic machine in the dining room. AVOID IT if you consider yourself a coffee lover. Ask the staff to make you an espresso or americano from the real machine at the bar. Trust me. Oh, and try the little cafe down the alley adjacent to the hotel - the cafe right next to the laundry facility. They make excellent sandwiches!

<Content>this hotel is second to none! What can I say - the best hotel I ever stayed in. I've been to Tokyo, London, Rome, Sydney and nothing compares to the service and genuinely friendly and helpful atmosphere in this hotel. My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon in early April purely on the strength of the reviews and comments on this site. From the moment we arrived we were treated so well it was unbelievable. We realised that maybe our experience wouldnt be quiet as good as everyone who posted here, but we were blissfully wrong.The gentleman who checked us in was so helpful and gave us loads of info on the immediate area. We had booked the famous blue room with balcony and it was a joy to behold. With marvellous views overlooking the Grand Canal, it was very spacious with lots of storage spaces and a beautiful and spotless marble bathroom.The breakfast was the usual continental style, but the young lady who ran the breakfast room was so kind and gave a warm and individual welcome every morning. She ran the place like clockwork and was so efficient and we began to think could this place get any better. It did. Unfortunately my wife was ill for a day or two during our stay, but the staff arranged for a doctor to visit her at the hotel. We obviously had to pay for this ourselves, but it was the kind and understanding way in which the staff assisted us which I will never forget. A lesser hotel might not want to know about your problems.As if that wasnt enough to recommend this hotel, the location was excellent. A short two minute walk over Scalzi bridge and you're at the St Lucia Train Station. During our stay we travelled to Milan, Florence and Vicenza on day trips and the close proximity to the station meant that we had lots more time to relax at our destination. Arriving back from Florence at 11.30pm, we were sipping a gorgeous hot chocolate at the bar in our hotel at 11.35pm!There are many fine restaurants (and an Irish bar) within a few footsteps of the hotel. I would recommend Gino's on the Rio Terra Lista di Spagna. They do a marvellous Pizza Calzone. St. Marks Square and Rialto Bridge are about a 20 minute walk from the hotel, but walking is the only true way to experience this city. Our trip was truely memorable and this was in no small part to the wonderful hotel. We will definately be returning to this hotel in near future.

<Content>Brilliant little hotel Staff were truly always helpful at any time. Rooms were quiet and perfect in size. Bathrooms were surprisingly large and always clean. This hotel was perfect for what we wanted. Breakfast was more than adequate and they even brought me proper expresso when asked. Some distance form the main areas but the walk was always fun and one can always take the vaporeretto. Definitely one up for trip advisor for recommending this one

<Content>What a Hotel 8 of us have just returned from the Hotel after 4 days of of an excellent experience. The hotel was brilliantly situated on the Grand Canal opposite the railway station and the Ferrovia Water Bus stop which made travelling around easy. there was also a gondola station outside the hotel which made sitting outside with a drink after a long day very interesting. The rooms were nicely decorated with chandaliers in the room and even in the bathroom. You could pay extra for a Canal view but we didn't bother. We enjoyed a lovely breakfast each morning for which we paid 5 Euros as Expedia travellers consisting of cold meat, cheese, boiled eggs, pastries, tea, coffee and orange juice. The staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Whilst not in the main area of venice this was quite nice as you could get away from the larger crowds. We shall certainly be recommending this hotel to our friends and booking again in the near future.

<Content>A lovely little hotel Prior to moving into an apartment for a week, we spent a night in the Hotel Antiche Figure in Venice. It is located on the Grand Canal, across from the train station, admittedly not the most charming view, which may account for its price being more reasonable.It does make it easy to find and handy if you will be taking trains. Our room was small, but attractive with a fine bathroom and closet space. The breakfast was typical of our experience with Italian hotel breakfasts; baked goods, fruit, cereal, slices of ham and cheese, etc. There was a neat self-service coffee machine from which you could get a selection of coffees. The desk staff spoke fabulous English, putting we Americans to shame. as usual. Allejandro (sp.?) made the phone call for us to contact the landlord of the apartment , a task I had been dreading . He also allowed us to store our luggage for several hours after we had checked out. As you leave the hotel take a left and walk into that pretty, less comercial area.This is a nice place to stay.

<Content>Great location in Venice Across the canal from the train station - you'd think it would noisy, butthe room was quiet, well-appointed, and very comfortable. The staff was top notch - emailed questions were answered sometimes withinan hour - when I phoned when we were in Italy already, the person whoI talked to said, when you get here, tell us what you want to do, and wewill help you make it happen. What more could you want? We were only there for two days in Venice, but had great meals at smallrestaurants (suggested by the hotel), had a great gondola ride (with agondolier who was 4th generation, spoke good English, and knew anamazing amount of Venetian history), went to Murano, ate dessert in frontof St. Marco square (expensive, but very much part of the Venice experience),and still had time to people watch and wander around.We had an early morning flight out of Marco Polo airport - the hotel arrangeda taxi (the driver walked over to the hotel to help one of our group, who neededassistance, with their bag).The breakfast, which was included with the room, was good - pastries, freshfruit, cereal, yogurt, and assorted teas, juices, and coffees. We splurged for this last hotel on our trip and had their best rooms on the top floorfacing the canal, still not as expensive as staying at many other hotels. It was agreat, comfortable, relaxing place to finish our 2 week trip to Italy. We hope toreturn to Venice and the Hotel Antiche Figure for a longer stay in the future.

<Content>Believe all the reviews I'm a tripadvisor fan and use it to decide on hotels around the world. It proved itself again in our choice of Hotel Antiche Figure for the May 1 long weekend. The hotel is lovely, it's location is excellent and its staff very helpful. We arrived a day late to the hotel, after BA cancelled our flight the previous night. When we arrived the staff were very apologetic (although it clearly wasn't their fault), and offered us free breakfast for the remainder of our stay (our expedia rate did not include breakfast) to make up for the lost day. To get to the hotel take the bus from the airport to the bus terminal in Venice. It only costs 2 euro's per person and it's only a 5 min walk from the bus terminal to the hotel. Would definately recommend this hotel.

<Content>Brilliant! Glad to see that the Antiche Figure has reached number one! We spent three days here around Liberation Day (25th April) and couldn't have wished for better. The Hotel is ideally situated for both the bus from the airport, the Ferrovia train station and the Ferrovia vaporetto stop. There is even a gondola stand immediately outside. Great breakfast (only 鈧? for Expedia customers, more for others) with a good selection of croissants, rolls, ham, cheese, hard boiled eggs and a wonderful panatone. Even the coffee machine produces an acceptable capaccino. Clean rooms and very helpful staff. The location is a little way away from the main attractions but we see that as a benefit especially when you can just hop on a vaporetto and get anywhere you want.

<Content>The Best Hotel I've stayed in... The Hotel Antiche Figure is the most excellent hotel in every respect that I've stayed in so far. The accomodation was absolutley superb and luxurious, the staff treated me as though I was a favourite member of their family. They were helpful and courteous - nothing was too much trouble. I am intending to revisit this hotel during the next few weeks. Thanks so much for a memorable and lovely break.

<Content>Delightful hotel; perfect position We picked this hotel for our first trip to Venice after reading Trip Advisor reviews and we weren't disappointed. We travelled from the airport on the bus which stops 5 minutes away. the staff were friendly and helpful, the room beautifully furnished, the bed comfortable and enormous and these two duvet-haters both appreciated the fact that there were sheets and blankets. we also had fun getting lost in the backstreets nearby. If we ever get to Venice again (and there is a lot we didn't have time to see) we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel We spent 3 nights in the Figure over Easter weekend during a two week trip to Italy. It was the best hotel we stayed in during our trip. Great location, extremely helpful staff, and wonderful room. All at a great price. After spending some time in San Marco we were thankful that we were staying here. We very much enjoyed sitting out front every evening. When we get back to Venice we will not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Everything you read! As many of us do, I count on the feedback I read on TA to decide on hotels. I want to say thanks to all the others who take time to write about their experiences. I chose the Antiche Figure for a week long visit to Venice based on TA notes and could not have picked a better hotel! Our next stay will absolutely be booked at this hotel.Roxanne

<Content>What a great place!! This little hotel is a real gem. It is only 5 minutes walk from the bus station(airport shuttle - 3 euros each way!!) and 2 minutes walk from the train station and the nearest vaporetto. The hotel is brilliantly placed for exploring Venice without the constant bustle of the central attractions. Our room was beautifully appointed with a georgeous and fully functional bathroom. Breakfast, for a small surcharge, was varied and fresh and made a great start to the day. What makes this hotel special above all else is the staff. They were unfailingly friendly, polite and helpful. They made you feel special and were cearly pleased that we had chosen the Antiche Figure. I have stayed in many hotels. Despite(or perhaps because of) its size,this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. If you want a really comfortable, accessible and friendly place to stay, you will not find better. I spent hours readng reviews before I picked this hotel. Save yourself the effort and worry. Just book it!! We will return to Venice and we will stay at the Antiche Figure.

<Content>Fabulous Figure What a fabulous find!I loved the Antiche Figure in so many ways, the Grand Canal view, the Gondolas at the doorstep, the beautifully appointed bedroom  magnificient bathroom, the tasty breakfast and the most charming and helpful staff and manager. I highly recommend checking this chic hotel out. Shame my visit was only for 4 days, I could have stayed in this small Venetian palace a lifetime.

<Content>A gem of a hotel My husband and I got back late last night from a two night stay in Venice on 9th and 10th April using this hotel. Venice exceeded our expectations - and the hotel made our stay extra special. Well done to all the staff at Hotel Antiche Figure for reaching No 1 in Tripadvisor!Location - excellent as it is a 5 min walk from coach station at Piazzale Roma, opposite the train station, adjacent to the Ponte d Scalzi Bridge (one of the three bridges to cross the Grand Canal) and opposite the Ferrovia waterbus stop.Hotel - extremely well maintained, spotlessly clean, excellent decor and furnishings throughout. We arrived on an early flight, and as a room had already been cleaned, it was made available to us early so we were able to settle in, freshen up and go straight into Venice. We had a red room to the rear on the 4th floor, which had a lovely view of the Grand Canal.Staff - they were all extremely welcoming, polite and helpful. The hotel receptionist booked the Ducale Palace secret tour for us (which is well worth visiting).Breakfast - this is provided in two small beautifully decorated rooms. Plenty of choice ie: rolls, ham, cheese, cereal, croissants, muffins, eggs, yoghurts, orange juice and coffee/tea etc.Recommendations - use the vaporetta (waterbuses) - buy the tickets at the booths entering the main landing stages ie: Ferrovia (single fare E5, 24 hr ticket E12, 72 hr ticket E25) and pickup a timetable. Don't just stick to main sights ie: Piazza San Marco (St Marks), Rialto Bridge etc, but meander the back streets by foot. We also took the waterbus to other islands ie: Burano (famous for lace and has wonderfully coloured houses), and Murano (famous for glass blowing). We used a local restaurant recommended by the hotel which was very nice, and also a restaurant using their tourist menu which was good value for money.

<Content>Excellent but do upgrade your room if you can. Very enjoyable 2 night stay. Upon arrival we were shown to our allocated room on the first floor. Accepting buildings are close to each other in Venice, there was no daylight at all. We were offered another room which was better but opted to pay a (negotiated) extra 50 Euros (for both nights) for a second floor canal facing blue room. Worth every penny of the extra - spacious, spotless, lots to see and very comfortable but if you are a light sleeper the boat engines do carry on through the night! Breakfast OK and essentially local fare although orange juice a bit like squash. Local restaurant nearby recommended by Hotel - Restorante/Pizzeria Vecio Pozzo very good - pizza at front, posh bit beyond - 拢30 to 拢35 per head with wine! Would definately stay at Hotel Antiche Figure again, without any hesitation.

<Content>Best Hotel in Venice All the reviews are spot on. The hotel is in a perfect location. Great rooms, friendly staff and close to lots of good restaurants.Being opposite one of only 3 bridges that crosses the Grand canal and a main Vaporetto stop it is very easy to explore Venice from this hotel. There are so many nice walks from Rialto Bridge to the hotel- make sure you explore the canals behind the hotel.The Scalzi restaurant opposite the bridge serves great food and is good value for money. A good tip- wherever you are in Venice there are numerous signs for Ferrovia (Train Station) which will always lead you back to the hotel.If we go back to Venice, we wouldn't stay anywhere else!PS Avoid Harry's bar- Overpriced and nothing to see!!

<Content>Can't say enough about Hotel Antiche Figure! We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel Antiche Figure. The hotel is directly across from the train station, just walk down the front steps and look across the Grand Canal. You couldn't ask for a more convenient location!The rooms were impeccably clean, well furnished and comfortable. The staff was extremely friendly and courteous. We were there for Carnival and the hotel offered capes and hats to rent (extremely inexpensive) for the day so we could enjoy the celebrations. I have travelled extensively throughout Europe and would recommend this hotel in a heart beat to anyone.

<Content>We really enjoyed this hotel People have written a lot of good thing about this hotel so please read them and I will not repeat. We were only in Venice for one night and the location was perfect. We took the train in, crossed 1 bridge to the hotel and were checked in immediately. We explained we were leaving by plane and they showed us the bus depot to the airport (only 2 or 3 blocks away) and even told us what bus to take. Our room was large compaired to New York and Europe rooms, it was on the top floor with a low beamed ceiling and very attractive. The only problem we had was the heat and air conditioning would not come on, but since it was perfect weather we just opened the windows. When we mentioned the problem the next morning, they said there was just a switch that needed turning on. This is something you may want to check if you stay there. All in all a very nice hotel.

<Content>Great especially for late night arrival at Santa Lucia The reviews don't lie - this hotel is really a find. The location is great - it's literally across the Grand Canal from the Santa Lucia train station. We had a red room (not a canal view) and it was quite small, but clean and charming. The bathroom had all the amenities and was really nice for a 3-star hotel.One world of caution, though. While it is literally steps from the station, it's the steps you need to keep in mind. To get over the canal, you need to go over a bridge that is all steps up and down. If you're over 50 and you're carrying a small suitcase and a tote bag, you'll be puffing by the time you get to the other side. I think it was worth it.We arrived at 8:30 p.m., checked in, dropped our bags, and went to find a pizzeria. That in itself is a typically Venetian adventure at night. To keep your bearings, just keep looking up to follow the signs for Rialto and make sure that the Grand Canal (the water) is always on your left. The rooms have high-speed internet access, but you must remind them when you check in to enable it. Also, the ethernet jack in our room was behind the TV armoire which we had to move to find. The gentleman who checked us in forgot to mention that little tidbit!We took the ATVO bus from the Piazzale Roma (10 min. walk with luggage and 2 bridges - remember the steps) to Marco Polo the next morning. CAUTION: You must buy your ticket for this bus in the ticket office at the plaza before you board the bus. The only time they allow you to buy your ticket on the bus is when the office is closed. We found out the hard way, although the driver very kindly and patiently waited for us (and about 5 other unaware tourists) to run and buy the tickets at the office. Imagine an American bus driver doing that!

When asked where to eat, we were pointed in the direction of a local pizzeria/restaurant. It was great also. The rooms were spacious and very clean. The location was great. We had a great time!!

<Content>wonderful! Just returned from a wonderful stay in venice- made all the more perfect with the Hotel Antiche Figure! What more can i add to what has already been written - the views onto the grand canal from our 4th floor room were amazing! Service was impecable. It is well worth paying the five euro for breakfast if you book with expedia; lots of choice and it really sets you up for the day ahead. Highlights of the trip for us were St Marks Square (obviously), The Basillica - although if you don't have a head for heights avoid climbing up to the balcony, my knees would not stop wobbling! Doge's palace was great for a rainy day. Do not miss Titian's Assumption of Mary in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei frari - it is truely a masterpiece! The Rialto Bridge is worth a photo opportunity but the crowds do get busy here, even in March. To get away from all the hustle and bussle of venice, a trip on the direct vaporetta to the islands of Murano, Burano and Torcello is recomended. A haven of peace and quiet but not too far away from all the action back in venice. Finally do not miss grabbing a front seat of the vaporetta, (Numbers 1 or 82), sailing up the grand canal with a birds eye view of venice laid out before you! - Fantastic!N.B don't bother with a map - they are useless,just follow the crowd and be prepared to get wonderfully lost!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel This hotel exceeded all expectations!It is superbly located just 5 minutes walk from the piazza roma - no need to try and travel on the vaperetto with your luggage.The staff are more than welcoming and remember all guests individually - this really adds to the holiday making you feel special and valued. They can't do enough for you and have a couple of restaurants they recommend which are superb.The accommodation itself is spotless and has a luxurious feel - we were lucky enough to stay in a blue room with stunning views overlooking the grand canal.The breakfast room is small but quaint and there is a good variety of breakfast items on offer following a continental theme.The location also ensures you discover the whole of Venice - if staying in/near St Marks Square it would be too easy not to venture further afield. The hotel istelf is located not too far from a hidden gem in Venice - the Frari Church, which is definately worth a visit.All in all a fantastic holiday which would not have been the same if not for the stay in the Antiche Figure - we will definitely be returning one day!

<Content>A wonderful small hotel, from a seasoned traveller Would highly recommend staying at this hotel. Rooms very clean, beautifully decorated, and excellent value for money. Receptionist gave a detailed, useful and friendly introduction to Venice on arrival. Unfortunately, I did not receive a wake-up call on my last day (as requested), but this will not detract from a wonderful 4 day break.

<Content>Little Treasure We have just returned from a 3 night stay in Venice. I love Venice anyway but the Hotel Antiche Figure made the stay even more special. The hotel and rooms look immaculate as if only recently decorated. Our room had a huge comfortable bed and the bathroom was luxurious and spotless. Breakfast buffet was generous.All the staff were friendly and helpful and spoke excellent english.Recommend getting the 3 day bus pass as it doesn't matter if you get on the wrong boat occasionally as we did. Although generally all travel was really easy to understand including buses back to the airport. Just remember the hotel is opposite the railway station and you can't go wrong.We found the location good as it was easy to find when we arrived and easy to get to the airport from. It also overlooked the Grand Canal which was a bonus. It is a little way from the main attractions but nowhere is difficult to get to in Venice as the bus services are so good. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>The Best This was the best hotel we have ever stayed in in Europe. We were hesitant about booking here since it is on the Grand Canal just across from the train station, but we couldn't have been happier with the quality of the hotel itself and the staff. Our room and bath were large, immaculate and beautifully appointed. For the off season price we paid, the Antiche Figure is a real bargain. We would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Five Star Treatment What a fantastic place! We booked with no real prior knowledge through Expedia. The bus from the airport cost a mere two Euros and dropped us just round the corner from this hotel. We received five star treatment ( in this three star hotel ). The desk staff were outstanding in their helpfulness and their recommendation of a local trattoria was so good we went there every evening. The room was beautifully appointed and we even had Venetian glass chandeliers in the bathroom. The breakfast was invoiced separately, but at five euros each was superb value with a choice of yoghurt, fruit, cereals, cold meats, cheese, various breads and croissants, preserves, etc. etc. The hotel is superbly situated for the water buses ( vaporetto ) and the main train station, enabling us to explore the entire Venetian lagoon and some cities inland too. I would more than happily stay at the Antiche Figure anytime.

<Content>Loved the hotel We booked our first trip to Venice last December, and just arrived back from our trip last night. We booked 6 nights at Antiche Figure based completely on the high-praise for the hotel found in the posts here. Our experience is that AF is a stellar value. The day we arrived we were offered either a red room (on the side away from the Grand Canal) at our booked rate, a blue room (top floor front facing the canal, as a 25eur/day upgrade), or since we were staying so many days, the apartment the hotel owns. We took the top floor front blue room, so I have no details about the apartment, although other folks have mentioned it in these reviews. We simply decided that the original Pallazzo windows and longer/better view from the fourth floor sounded too good to pass up.*The hotel is incredibly convenient to the 3euro airport atvo-bus drop at Piazalla Roma (5mins walk down the canal to the landmark 'big green dome church' across the Grand Canal from the modern Ferrovia train station)*The room was spotless. *The bathroom was great: marble floors, walls, sizable tub with hand-shower. Nice modern fixtures. And of course the oft-mentioned beautiful murano crystal fixtures.*king-size bed (dbl-twin) mattresses).*mini-bar hidden in the desk (not cheap: 4euro cokes, but hey, it's extremely convenient and nothing in Venice is cheap :D)*a few foibles - not issues, as these aren't essential or even wanted items -- just differences compared to what you may see in western hotels: no alarmclock/radio (but wakeup calls are avail), no iron, no vending machines, no ice machine (that we saw). I mention these simply so that you can bring suitable items if you want them...*we booked through travelocity and the included continental breakfast was good. Nice array of options (croissants, meat, cheese, a nice rolled coffee cake,cereals,soft-boiled eggs in the shell, a variety of yogurts, etc...), all tasted very good, and you could eat as much as you wanted - no reason for anyone to go hungry. The lady policing the breakfast room was a pleasant blur of motion as she sailed around keeping the tables cleared  stocked. Yes the coffee from the machine is very strong, and be sure to use the 'stop' button to keep it from over-filling your cup.:D We got a table daily around 9:40am in the breakfast room. Except one day, when they had very few people checking out, all but two rooms booked and everyone decided to eat between 9  10 -- that was the only day that we actually saw they'd had to expand service to the tables out in the bar out front... We were there during the very slow period in Feb, but I could see where it could be a real scramble to get in for breakfast in July/Aug. Also, I can't for the life of me believe there's a review here from someone that sat in the breakfast room and waited for service. It's pretty clear it's a self-serve breakfast with several buffet tables of things to eat.*the staff is great. From management to the lady that cleaned our room. They were very interested in how happy we were, actively solicited ideas for improvements, and suggested several wonderful restaraunts when we asked. On serveral occasions they offered to make reservations for their recommendations.*When you're in Venice, USE THE VAPPRETTOS and available multi-day passes! We walked everywhere for five of the six days and my feet took a heck of a beating (still got the blisters to show for it). Not to mention, Venice can be a pretty tough town to navigate in on-foot, as the chains of signs leading you from Ferrovia (the landmark train station near hotel) to Rialto  S. Marco can be very easy to lose track of as you're navigating. We got solidly lost at least once a day -- found ourselves coming back to the hotel through the soon-all-too-familiar Cannaregio section instead of the shorter Rialto route, on several ocassions. It can get frustrating. The vapprettos are easy, fast, and largely fool-proof. Just sit down and watch things go by. Not to mention they're alot less excertion than hiking.:D*We loved Ostaria al Vecio Pozzo! Ended up eating there FOUR TIMES! We had some difficulty with book-recommended restaraunts all over town (all but one of the 7 we tracked down on foot from Rick Steves' 2006  Knopf Cityguide were permanently/seasonally closed). So whenever we got tired of tracking around town to restaraunts that may or may not be open, we just went to Vecio Pozzo! They always recognized us and greeted us warmly each visit. They've even got a web site with a large gallery of pictures, although it doesn't show the best part: the wonderful food or the people!: ---. Map at the site. As others have mentioned, it's a few blocks along the street on the right of the hotel, on Corte Canal # 656.*Another restaraunt recommended by the manager was Trattoria Antica Besseta. Very nice seafood, although the restaraunt was hard for us to find. We had both directions on our map (drawn by AF's manager) and a map on the back of the Besetta business card he gave us, and we still got completely lost and had to ask directions. 1395 Salizada de C脿 Zusto (3-4 blks NE of the hotel). *Finally, another good spot from the Knopf Cityguide, that was open not very expensive and had great food, though not particularly close to the hotel, was Osteria Ai Assassini, in San Marco, On Rio Tera Dei Assassini, #3695 (several blks north of the Fenice Opera house off of Calle D. Verona).

<Content>Great place to Stay We would recommend this hotel very much. The position is ideal, just 5 minutes walk from Piazza La Roma where the buses stop from the airport. The decor is lovely, the place is spotlessly clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was nice with a lot of things to choose from. We will be going there again, no doubt, watch out here we come!!!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel in a Convienent Location This hotel is directly across from the main train station and is in easy walking distance from the main bus depot. The hotel is among the best value I have found at after staying in about 100 hotels across Europe. It was recently renovated and everything is clean and the staff is incredibly helpful. It was the first time I have ever been asked by any hotel employee How could we improve the experience for future guests. Such a profound concept coming from a European, as customer service is typically lacking in many establishments.

<Content>First Class Have just left this hotel after a couple of nights stay and cannot praise this hotel enough. The location is great - right oposite the railway station. We paid around 拢55 per night (low season I guess). Staff so friendly and helpful - they kept the bar open for us late one evening and treated us to free Lemoncello!! Roooms spacious and very clean. Lovely bathrooms. Cannot recommend this hotel enough.

<Content>A good experience for us! I booked this hotel 3 months ago after reading good reviews on Tripadvisor and it lived up to all expectations. The room was excellent and the staff friendly and helpful.We splashed out and booked a canal view room for 4 nights and it was definitely worth it. Watching Venetian life pass by from our duel aspect 3rd floor room added an extra dimension to our holiday.Many hints and tips can be found in previous reviews but the ones I would particularly endorse include:Buying the 3 day waterbus ticket.The free trip to Murano by watertaxi (bookable at the hotel reception).Eating at the Ostaria al Vecio Pozzo a few minutes walk away (again, bookable at reception)If you're visiting the Doge's Palace consider buying a Museum ticket which will also give free access to other museums in the city. We spent an enjoyable (and inexpensive!) final day hopping on and off the vaporettos visiting those we had previously missed. Another invaluable tip was to follow the signs to Ferrovia (station) to find your way back to the hotel.Finally - we paid an extra 5 euros each for breakfast which was good value. I had read in previous reviews about the infamous coffee machine. I have to say it was fine for our morning tea but the coffee was not good! However,when I mentioned it on departure, I was informed by a member of staff that a freshly made coffee may be ordered and brought on request. So that's my main new tip to pass on to future guests!We very much enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would definitely recommend it to friends.

<Content>Could not fault this place.... Thank you to contributors to Tripadvisor - we booked this hotel for a long weekend in Venice in January and we really could not fault it. Don't be put off by the 3* superior rating, the price or the photos, it is excellent. Arriving into the bus station/railway station (can't stand the boarding scrum for Ryanair but that is another issue) go over the bridge, turn left along the canal, walk 100 metres and you are there. It is not the best end of the city, but you will be smiling watching the other passengers struggle to St Mark's Square. The hotel is warm and friendly. We booked a canal view room, which was exceptionally clean and comfortable. The marble bathroom was excellent and the whole place just looks new and well cared for. The staff were so helpful, booking restaurants and concerts for us and nothing was too much trouble. They also take a pride in maintaining standards and know how highly they are rated on Tripadvisor. I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel to anybody.Points to note - Expedia bookings do not include breakfast which is 5 euros and worth it. The view over the Grand Canal is mostly of the train station which isn't the prettiest view in Venice. You may get a little noise from the river buses but this quietens down at night and shouldn't put you off. You will also notice that the lift makes an annoying noise when it arrives but again these are only minor issues. If you want a reasonable break in Venice definitely book this place. Get the Time Out guide as it was briliant for restaurants, also get a 22 euro boat pass when you arrive which is great value. Take some very warm clothes if you go in January. If you can, avoid Treviso airport until they have built the new terminal - the current one is a joke!

<Content>Antiche Figure was perfect We stayed at Antiche Figure right after Christmas, 2005. STAFF- front desk, housekeepers, breakfast room attendants... ALL were always very nice and helpful. Front desk staff all spoke excellent english. LOCATION - PERFECT location. Right on the canal. Right across (literally) from the train station and vaperreto stop. 30 minute stroll (timed it) from Plaza San Marco.ROOMS - beautiful, clean and comfortable.BREAKFAST - Great! for a continental breakfast, they had a wide variety of foods. Coffee machine was a bit wonky, but nothing's perfect. Breakfast room attendant was incredibly nice and helped me put together a breakfast tray for my husband when he was sick. Even ran out to open the elevator for me!!!RETURN? - in a heartbeat!!! =)

<Content>Better than the Waldorf Astoria! Last weekend we arrived in a very cold and misty Venice, but what a warm welcome we got in hotel Antiche Figure! At the reception Alessandro patiently and kindly informed us about the hotel, breakfast etc. We had booked one of the spacious canal view rooms (blue room, nr. 211), preferably with balcony and so we got it! The room was beautifully furnished, very clean with excellent king size beds and a super luxurious marble bath room with Venetian chandeliers. We have also stayed at the Waldorf in NY, but the room we had there was not as well maintained as ours in Antiche Figure! The location of the hotel is also perfect: the vaporetto and railway station just in front. The area is more quiet but when you cross the bridge you are in a lively area with shops, restaurants etc., but not as expensive as in the San Marco area (E 10,-- for a sip of coffee, shame on them; please make sure you also double check the bill!!). We can really recommend this lovely hotel with very service minded staff: the breakfast lady (we think she's called Linda) fulfils are your breakfast wishes with pleasure, she's great and very hardworking. Unfortunately we missed Francesca, who was on a holiday. Gianni who helped us check-out was also a very service minded and kind guy and helped us efficiently with our transfer to the airport. We can highly recommend this lovely hotel and we would like to thank the wonderful staff and send them regards from Holland. We think Antiche Figure should be ranked no. 1 on Trip Advisor for Venice hotels! Josephine  Barbara

<Content>A great hotel We were in Venice for a little more than 24 hours, so we needed a place that was central, but also wanted one that had ambiance. We found it with this hotel. The hotel itself was in a perfect location - across the Grand Canal from the train station. The staff couldn't have been more helpful - from helping us decide what to do in the short time we had, to suggesting the perfect place for dinner. We had a chance to upgrade to a canal view room, but decided not to: every room in this hotel is wonderful. The breakfast was great, and we were able to leave our bags in the hotel until it was time to board our train. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Beautiful Venice This was our first trip to Venice and we chose the hotel Antiche Figure. The hotel is conveniently situated near the Piazzale di Roma and just opposite the train station. The staff was very helpful, and a special mention should go to Linda in the breakfast room who was very attentive and went that extra mile. We upgraded to a room overlooking the canale grande and that was certainly an excellent move for only EUR 30.00 a day extra. A lovely little hotel and very clean.

<Content>Just Perfect... For Venice the staff was very couteous and friendly, which in my opinion says a lot. The hotel was a great find. We were upgraded to a canal view room upon check in for only 20 euros more. Excellent location on the Grand Canal and right across from Santa Lucia Station. I would recommend and stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Excellent Choice My husband and I arrived in Venice at Piazzale Roma by bus from the airport and were able to walk to Antiche Figure Hotel with our luggage and, later, to return to the Piazzale for our rental car when we left Venice. The hotel is also across the Grand Canal from the train station and from a vaporetta stop. For us, it was very well situated. The accommodations were very comfortable and the staff helpful. It is an excellent place to stay while in Venice.

<Content>Impressive Hotel !! Having read the great reviews about this hotel on tripadvisor, my wife and I decided to book this hotel for a short 3 night city break. This is certainly an impressive hotel with service to match.The staff were always helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble which of course made our stay all the more comfortable and enjoyable. To see many of the tourist sights, walking really is the best way to get around Venice (together with a good map-which the hotel provided) and with that in mind, the location of this hotel couldn't be better. The room we had was spotless. In summary, we have no hesitation in recommending this first-class hotel to anyone wishing to enjoy the splendour of Venice.

<Content>Such a loverly little hotel What a fantastic Hotel to stay in. Staff very helpful and friendly. The location is great only 5 mins away from where the bus dropped us off. All attractions close enough to walk to so very little money needs to be spend on water buses.The view of the canel was out of this world. venice is an excellent place, so much to see and explore.The rooms in the Hotel Antiche Figure are just right large beds and lots of storage space. The decoration is beautiful. The whole atmosphere was very romanic.Would definatly recommend and hope to go back myself.

<Content>Perfect hotel with which to end the Italy Grand Tour My husband and I just returned from an eight day trip through Italy and ended our stay at the Hotel Antiche Figure. The hotel, room, and staff were absolutely charming. All three of the front desk clerks we encountered spoke English very well and were wonderfully friendly and helpful, as was the woman who managed the breakfast area. Our room was just big enough, cozy, and clean. The bathroom was also spotless and a good size, relative to other hotels we have visited in Europe. The only thing that we saw that could be improved was the selection of food for breakfast. The food that was offered was good, but limited. However, I would note that the spread was pretty standard as compared to other hotels in Europe. The breakfast room itself was very spacious and clean.The location of the hotel was also extremely convenient for us since we arrived at Venice by train (the train station is right across the canal), we were able to catch a water bus to anywhere in Venice with a short three minute walk, and we departed Venice by plane (the main bus station with shuttles to the airport is a short 5 - 10 minute walk away). A tip to save some money: Buy the 22 Euro travel card from ACTV. It is good for 72 hours of unlimited trips on any of the ACTV water buses (including the Grand Canal water buses) and land buses (including the bus #5 to the airport).We would without a doubt return to this hotel on future trips to Venice.

<Content>Excellent Stayed in the Antiche Figaro in November and found it to be perfect for our needs. Excellent, canal view room and friendly staff who helped no end. We would not hesitate to return, and recommend it!!Take advantage of the Hotel recommendations with regard to food and you won't be disappointed.Vaperetto stop outside the hotel, however we used this rarely as it was easily walkable to all major sights. Fantastic location close to the Piazza de Roma, so only a 5 min walk to the hotel from where the bus drops you off.

<Content>As Per Great Reviews I booked this hotel on the basis of the consistantly good reviews given to it via Trip Advisor.The best thing about the hotel is the honesty and integrity of the staff which I have found lacking in some Venetian Hotels. I suppose this is understandable with the huge number of tourists there.It was very clean, quiet, the staff appear to enjoy their job and your presence and very good value for money. I will stay here again if I get the opportunity.

<Content>Great Stay in Venice My girlfriend and I traveled to Venice for a short two night stay on our way to Rome. Venice overall, is not for me. I was bored to tears after the first night. I think after you do Saint Mark's square, feed the pigeons, and do the gondola, not sure what else there is to do. Of course we are two females (28 and 29), and not romantics, or honeymooning. We were looking to party and there was no partying to be had in Venice.Anyway, the location of this hotel CANNOT be beat, it was so nice to hop off the train (from Florence and Milan respectively), and cross the bridge and we are at our hotel. Of course we over packed and had to negotiate the stairs, but that's ok, we didn't have to hassle with the water taxi's or figure out the water bus schedules. That was great! I got to the hotel first and my room was ready on the first floor and we were pleasantly surprised. The use of a full length mirror with two females was very handy. Also, liked having the use of a safe in the room, and we loved the shower/tub combo, since this is rare. The location of the hotel is near restaurants and the concierge was very helpful and went above and beyond. They translated for us, when my girlfriend picked up a Milan soccer player that only spoke Italian; we only spoke English and some Spanish/French. Other than the concierge telling us he was a millionaire (NOT), she was a good sport about relaying messages. The b-fast was average, but this is a real deal and we booked it on Travelocity for like $125/night, so we were happy with our hotel choice. Thanks tripadvisor community, you got this one right.choice. Have fun!

<Content>Charming Hotel My husband and I just got back from a weekend at the Hotel Antiche Figure, which we booked entirely on the basis of the reviews on Trip Advisor. We were delighted with the hotel and have no hesitation in recommending it very highly.It is small, intimate, decorated to a very high standard and has very helpful, charming, English-speaking staff.It is located on the side of the Grand Canal in Santa Croce, right next door to San Simeone Piccolo (large church with green dome). It is easily walked from either the train station (directly opposite the hotel via the Scalzi Bridge), or from the bus station in Piazzale Roma. If you are coming in from Marco Polo airport, take the blue ATVO bus (3 euro)which takes about 20 minutes. When you disembark the bus in Piazzale Roma, walk down the steps at the side of the Santa Chiara Hotel on to the banks of the Grand Canal. It's about a five minute walk (across two small bridges).The location is great, because you're not reliant on the vaporetto and a long walk before you get to your hotel. The restaurants recommended are cheaper and friendlier than those in the touristy areas around the Rialto bridge and San Marco.Just be prepared to walk a fair amount but we certainly felt that it was worth it, and we'd have no hesitation in going back to Hotel Antiche Figure!

Breakfast good.Location very good, close to the bus station, opposite the train station  most importantly opposite one of the main water bus stops in the city. The 3 day ticket recommended by the hotel staff was the most worthwhile purchase of our stay-the best way to travel in VeniceCheck out erly  leave your luggage for collection later- amutually convenient arrangement for us  the hotelA hotel to recommend to anyone. We will certainly visit again

<Content>Don't hesitate - book it! This is the ideal place to stay in Venice - a little away from the main tourist sites and the crowds but close enough to get to them easily and quickly by boat. The bus from Treviso airport stops 5 minutes walk away so there are just two small bridges to haul your luggage over - and the railway station is opposite if you come by train - again just 5 minutes walk over the Scalzi bridge. Your luggage can be stored if necessary after check out. There are plenty of quaint little alleyways, squares, shops, churches etc to explore [and get lost in!] close by after you have done the major sights.The view from the front [blue] rooms over the Grand Canal is well worth paying a bit extra for - the rooms are larger, not noisy, and watching the busy river traffic can be quite entertaining. We learned that the hotel was renovated and opened about three years ago - the rooms are spotless, very well equipped, comfortable and cosy with well designed quality fittings and fabric wallpaper [unmarked!] - even glass chandeliers over the two sinks in our large bathroom!Breakfast was certainly more than adequate - but there are no hot cooked eggs/bacon/sausage etc - previous writers comments have either been noted or expectations were too high.Staff are friendly - position is ideal - just note that there is no hotel lounge or restaurant so in bad weather the bar or your room is the only place to relax. Hence the three rather than five stars the hotel deserves. Thoroughly recommended!

<Content>Better than Wonderful! We had two nights in Venice before boarding our cruise ship. Looked on-line, saw the Hotel Antiche Figure reviews and booked our stay. We were six women in our 30's to 50's.From the airport we took a vapparetto (80 euros for us all including massive luggage) directly to the dock at the hotel. We were greeted on the dock by Alessandro the Manager, who quickly helped us with our luggage.Upon entering the hotel we were just knocked out by how beautiful the lobby and bar area were and how helpful Allesandro and his staff were. They answered every question we had (in English) and helped us with money exchange, telephone calls, restaurant recommendations, trips to Murano (the boat came and picked us up at the dock in front of the hotel). The entire staff goes out of their way to be helpful. Francesca (night manager) mentioned a wonderful restaurant that the locals love -- Ostaria al Vecio Pozzo -- a 5 minute walk around the corner from the hotel. The food was wonderful, the pace leisurely, and the staff very friendly and attentive.Our room was a canal view with balcony, third floor triple. The beds were all comfortable and the room was quiet and luxurious. The bathroom with all the marble and murano glass was georgous! The breakfast was great and it is included in the price of the room! I had a bit of trouble with the coffee machine, but the dining room server was happy to help me. The breakfast was more than we had expected...from cereals, yogurt, fruit, muffins, breads, to meats and cheeses. Trust me, we didn't go hungry.This should be listed as 5 star...it is beautiful, well run, and the staff is outstanding! When I return to Venice, I'm booking this hotel again.Barbara (and 5 lady friends)

<Content>Beautiful room, convenient location, friendly service We were really happy with our stay at this property.The room was large and beautifully decorated with furniture that was well matched to the romantic venetian vibe. The bathroom was large, clean, and even had venetian glass light fixtures. This was the nicest room we stayed in while in Italy.The location across from the the modern looking train station on the Grand Canal was not entirely romantic, but extremely practical. It allowed us to avoid lugging our luggage around on foot or on the often crowded vapporettos.Service was always friendly if not entirely knowledgable. The hotel provided umbrellas in the lobby for their guest when it rained, and we got a great restaurant recommendation for a place frequented by locals.

<Content>Quaint, lovely gem For your first nights in Venice, after an overnight flight or a long train ride, I cannot conceive of a nicer intro to Venice. This lovely, quaint gem is close to the bus and train stations and to a major vaporetta stop. The management was extreemly gracious and helpful. While a bit pricey, this is Venice.

<Content>Albergo magnifico!!!!! The vast majority of responders here are in total agreement that Antiche Figure is one of the best!!! If it were in New York City, it would be a five star establishment. Put it in the top 10 as Manager, Alessandro, hopes it will soon be placed. It deserves it. Antiche is a definitive part of the joy of Venice. The staff, especially Alessandro(you can tell by the gentlemanly way he responds to those who ran into difficultly), Francesca, and Gianni, were always available, helpful and very communicative(in either English or Italian!). The breakfast was more than adequate(would agree that a specially brewed cup of coffee would improve things slightly-but the machine provided some mirth when clients found it difficult to operate and had it run over on them! Nothing serious, but a delightful way to wake up in the morning!). The views, area in Venice, accessibility to everything, and the benefits of using the hotel for trips to Murano, etc. are all splendid! Room was well attended, carefully groomed, large enough for two of us, with a more than adequate bathroom. The setting reminded us of our stay in the Hotel Riva in Giardini, Sicily. Similar hotel, similar staff, all top drawer. Thank you, Alessandro, Francesca, and Gianni for a wonderful four day stay! We will try to get back to see you, but if we are delayed, don't forget, we would love to extend the flavor to you should you decide to visit our New York area.  Ti saluto affettuosamente, Bob and Vicki

<Content>A small gem in a great city Contrary to the previous few nay-sayers, this lovely, small, and expertly maintained hotel is operated at the same high service level as the much more expensive hotels in this exceptional city. VERY professional and caring front desk, always ready to offer help, and among the best encountered anywhere by this former travel agent. The clean and recently renovated rooms are somewhat small by American standards, but perfectly adequate. The location near the Pizzalle Roma bus and rail stations may seem a negative, but is actually a benefit to those otherwise carrying baggage up and down the many bridges to hotels nearer the center. A nearby vaporetto stop brings all of Venice into easy reach. Fine restaurants nearby. Wonderful areas to stroll all around the hotel. Even the included breakfast is well done. Best of all is the price - at least 50% less that comparable hotels.

<Content>This is a great small hotel This is a lovely small hotel in a location convenient to vaporetti, the train station and the bus terminal. They serve a delicious breakfast, included in the room rate. Rooms are clean and comfortable. It is the staff, however, that is the hotel's prize asset - very friendly, very helpful, and anxious to make your stay a pleasant and memorable one.

<Content>Hotel Antiche Figure, Location is wonderful The Hotel Antiche Figure, what a wonderful location as it's only a 10 min walk from the bus station situated right by the Grand Canal, as you get off the coach at the bus station look along the canal for the church with the green dome and you will find the hotel right next door. So while everyone else is walking past with their suitcases you are already settled in, and sat at your table outside the hotel with a glass of Prosecco relaxing and reflecting on what a gem of a hotel you have found, because it is a gem. The staff are very accomodating, as soon as you walk through the door of this wonderful hotel it feels like home, the room we had was a triple, very well decorated with a stunning bathroom, soft towels, plenty of hot water and a hairdryer. The beds were a good size and the room had a fridge and a safe for no extra charge. Breakfast, although it was only a continental was adequate and a welcome start to the day in a pleasant environment, the staff again very friendly. I could not rate this hotel highly enough and it's a wonderful base for anyone visiting Venice.Some other information I would like to share if you are planning a trip to Venice and landing at Marco Polo Airport walk out to where the buses stop and take the Blue ATVO coach to Piazzale Roma only 3 euros, a cheap way to get to the above hotel and it only takes 20 mins. Also if you choose to stay at the above hotel and want to try a lovely restaurant walk down the alley way to the left of the hotel as you walk out of the front entrance and part way down on the left is a restaurant called Ostaria al Vecio Pozzo, the food is mouth watering and used alot by the locals, which is always a good sign.This hotel and the location of it made our trip to Venice as I am sure it would for anyone reading this review.

<Content>5 star accommodation for a 3 star price. My mother and I stayed here for 3 nights as part of our tour of Europe and were so impressed with this hotel. All the staff could not have been more helpful with directions, sight seeing recommendations and restaurants. We had a blue room as we felt we needed a little bit of room and preferred a view of the Grand Canal We were certainly not disappointed. After a busy day shopping and sighteeing we would arrive back to our beautiful room with a bottle of vino, open our windows to the Grand Canal and watch Venetian life pass by, it was brilliant! The twin basin bathroom with beautiful chandeliers was a little luxury also when there is two of you. After choosing this hotel from many on tripadvisor we were so relieved to find it was everything we had hoped, read and wished for. Thank you Alessandro and Gianni for a memorable stay! I hope to one day return with my husband!

<Content>I highly recommend Antiche Figure We were just in Venice for 2 nights (far too brief). The weather was poor, but the hotel more than made up for that, being the nicest hotel of our entire trip to Italy. We had a large room overlooking the canal, with a great bathroom. I found this hotel to be as asthetically pleasing as it was friendly and comfortable. We were a party of 3 couples and we all agreed the location was very good. We really enjoyed Gianni, who helped us with everything, right down to providing me information on how to purchase one of the beautiful light fixtures I admired there. Another highlight was an Enoteca (wine bar/restaurant) we went to that friends had recommended. Gianni said it is well-known and can help you find it. The owner is a real character and has written a guide book on Enoteca's throughout Europe.

<Content>Service above and beyond We just returned from Venice where we stayed at Hotel Antiche Figure a charming hotel conveniently locate on the Grand Canal and across from the train station. Our rooms were wonderfully appointed. Our attentive hosts were so responsive - with ideas of what to see, where to eat. Imagine our delight when we found their concern for us continued even after we left. When I returned home, I was unable to find a jacket I had taken on my trip and wondered if I might have left it in Venice. I emailed the hotel and within an hour I had a response; within a week I had my jacket! What a treat to find such high standards of service and graciousness!

<Content>Hotel Antiche Figure the BEST It was hard to believe this Hotel was only rated a 3! My husband  I started our European vacation with a cruise to the Greek Islands and finished with 3 days at this hotel. It is located so close to the port that we were able to check out the hotel before we even took off for Greece. As such, we were able to look forward to even more luxury, comfort and entertainment once disembarked. This hotel has an excellent location for purposes of transportation to anywhere/anything. The staff were not only exceptional in demeanor and helpfulness, but also in timely direction to our every need. ALWAYS presented with a smile! They even extended this service and characteristic to anyone coming in off the walkway to get information! Our room was extremely accommodating/comfortable and even 'quiet,' as it faced the Grand Canal. We WILL come back to this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We stayed for 3 nights in the Antiche Figure and I have to say that it lived up to all the previous Trip Advisor reviews I'd read before going. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The bedroom was a gem, overlooking the Grand Canal and was extremely well decorated and was spotlessly clean. The TV broke on day 1 and a brand new one was delivered within the hour. The breakfast room is small but the buffet breakfast is excellent. The hotel is easy to find near to the Railway station and The Piazzala Roma where the airport bus arrives. I would advise you to get the bus in from the airport - 3 Euros as you will have plenty of opportunities to use the Vaporettos (water buses) during your stay and a Water taxi will cost 80 Euros from the airport and take longer to get there.The best value and most interesting trip was the Secret Itineries Tour of the Doges Palace. Only 25 people on the tour and only in 3 languages so the English tour gets booked up with Americans, Dutch, Germans Scandinavians etc. You therefore must book in advance on the internet as the tour will be full on the day.Walking to the Rialto will take 15 mins from the hotel and St Marks will take 25mins and it is quite easy to get lost in the small alleyways. However if you follow the yellow signs its easy and its also easy getting back to the hotel as you just follow the Railway signs (Ferrovia) which are all over town.

Staff all seemed friendly and helpful.Enjoyed sitting canalside at the hotel with a prosecco watching the world go by..would recommend Antiche Figure ! Just off the main area(of Santa Croce) discovered great restaurants in what felt like a film set...sitting out by a tiny canal with just the odd gondoler passing by was wonderful! Would love to return anytime of year !! Ciao.

<Content>Great hotel in great city This hotel was booked on the internet by my boyfriend for our 4th anniversary.We were pleasantly surprised with what we found. It's in great location (walking distance from the bus terminus for the airport bus (very easy to navigate), on the Grand Canal, opposite markets/shops etc. It's a pleasant walk to all the tourist sights.We arrived late at night and were upgraded for our first night to a huge room overlooking the canal with antique furniture and his and hers sinks and marble bath. We were in the standard room on the second night, still okay but much smaller and less of a view.Go to Harry's Bar for a bellini (and dinner if you have the money), go on a gondola (bargain a price), eat ice-cream, pizza etc. Venice is a lovely city to spend a couple of days.

<Content>A highlight of Venice What a wonderful hotel. It is small, clean, beautifully decorated, and the staff are so kind and professional. The location is amazing on the Grand Canal. It is just far enough away from St. Marco's Square to give you some relaxation and it it very easy to get from the train/bus station to the hotel (no expensive water taxis or lugging your bags all over the city). You will not be disappointed if you stay here.

<Content>Antiche Figure, absolutely fantastic I visited the hotel Antiche Figure over the bank holiday weekend at the end of August with my mother, having done much research on Tripadvisor for the right place to stay. We couldn't have picked anywhere better.Rooms: The room we had was very large by european standards, it was a twin bedded room overlooking the Grand Canal. We had paid in advance for a grand canal room and definitely felt it was worth the extra 50 euros per night. In total, the room cost 180 euros per night and we were there for four nights.The beds were huge for single beds, very comfortable and fresh. They were made up everyday by the friendly maid. The room also had a TV and an internet socket. It was decorated in a traditional italian style with beautiful furnishings and exceptional attention to detail. The room also has a minibar, safe and large cupboards. The bathroom was equally as lovely and was again large by european standards, decorated all in marble with two sinks, a toilet and a bath with shower. The lights were all traditional Murano glass lights. Both the room and bathroom were cleaned to a very high standard every day.Even though the room was over looking the canal, once the windows are shut you hear nothing. We could not hear the amazing storm we had, let alone the rumble of waterbuses.Staff: were incredibly accommodating. Prior to the trip they answered all email correspondances very quickly and if you phone them they speak perfect english and are more than helpful. I also heard the staff speak very good spanish and french while we were there. When we arrived, we were supplied with a map of Venice and were pointed in the direction of the main sites. We were also given a free trip to Murano and tour around one of the glass factories, which was really lovely. It was very nice to be able to arrive by water taxi, which are otherwise horrendously expensive! We just went down one morning to inquire about the trip assuming we'd have to give notice but they booked it there and then and 15 minutes later we were in the taxi. The lady that served the breakfast in the morning was always so polite, happy and helpful, as were all the other staff. Breakfast itself was a small buffet, consisting of croissants, rolls, cheeses, meats, cereals, yoghurts, eggs, fruit, juices and hot drinks. A great way to start a long days sightseeing!Location: The hotel Antiche Figure is situated exactly opposite the railway station and about 5 minutes walk from Piazzale Roma (the last place that cars are allowed in the city). It was so convenient. From Marco Polo airport just take the ATVO bus costing 3 euros to Piazzale Roma (it takes about 20 minutes) and then head for the green domed church and scalzi bridge on the grand canal. You can also get a road taxi to piazzale roma but it will cost about 30 euros. Alternatively you can arrive by water taxi, but they are incredibly expensive, usually about 80 euros from the airport. If arriving from Treviso airport, you can get the ATVO bus from there for about 4.50 euros which arrives in the same place. Always remember to buy airport bus tickets from the office at the airport or, for the return journey, from the office in piazzale roma in advance. Although on the map the hotel looks like it is far from the main hub of Venice, this is simply not true. Venice is a small place and it only takes about 15-20 minutes to walk to the Rialto and St Marks area. It is a benefit to be far away from St Marks Square as you will find that the restaurants further out give much better value for money. If you can't face the walk, the waterbus stop is right outside the hotel across the bridge. You can buy a one day ticket for 10.50 euros or 3 day ticket for 22 euros. You can also buy a card called the VeniceCard blue/orange which give waterbus use and discounts at many museums and churches.If you head up to the Cannareggio region to the north there are some lovely restaurants. One restaurant which i WOULD NOT recommend is the Mirabar between the hotel and piazzale roma. It is poor value for money and the service is appauling too!Another nice thing about the hotel is that it has a small bar which is lovely at night. You can sit outside and watch the world go by.Although not to do with the hotel, I must recommend a particular tour at the Doge's Palace, called the 'Secret Itineries' tour. This needs ot be booked a few days in advance, and can be done so on the internet or by phone. The official price is 15 euros per adult, though some websites charge a lot more. We phoned up the palace 4 days before arrival but when we arrived they had lost the reservation number and claimed it was our fault and handed it back to us. It took about 25 minutes of 'discussions' to sort it out but eventually they let us go anyway even though they said it was all our fault and not their responsibility. Half way around the tour, the guide presented us with a reference number asking if it was ours, which it matched exactly, it had been lost in the office, no apology...The tour itself however is fantastic, it takes you to all the locked rooms in the doge's palace. You get to see the torture chambers, learn all about the system and hear Casanova's tale and see the cells where he was kept prisoner. I would also recommend a tour of the theatre La Fenice. It costs 7 euros each (6 euros on presentation of a waterbus ticket at the ACTV office in piazzale roma). it is very good value and they run tours in all different languages. So, the reason I have given the Antiche Figure 5/5 is because it is exceptional value for a 3* superior hotel. I doubt you would find another hotel at this price to match the Antiche Figure. Sorry to also include other information, but felt it might be useful!!! I would recommend the hotel's website for pictures of the rooms and location etc.

<Content>The Perfect Venetian Hotel If you are looking for the perfect hotel in Venice, this is it. The room was absolutely lovely, large by Venetian standards, with a little balcony overlooking the Grand Canal. The front desk personnel were more than helpful and the internet connection in the room was a blessing after having been out of the US for more than a week. The breakfast room is set up beautifully and breakfast was more than adequate. If I am ever back in Venice, I would not hesitate to book this hotel again.

<Content>Great hotel - exceeded expectations My daughter and I stayed at the Antiche Figure at the end of March. We booked the hotel after reading other reviews on Trip Advisor, and couldn't have picked a better hotel. The location is perfect and only a few minutes walk from the bus terminal (Direct bus from the airport for about 3 euros). The hotel is a charming old building situated on the Grand Canal, and throughout our stay the staff were friendly and more than helpful. Our room on the second floor was beautifully decorated, very comfortable and spotlessly clean. Breakfast was as expected for a three star hotel and a welcome start to the day! We easily managed to walk all over Venice from here (about 15 minutes to St Marks), it was nice to return to an area not so crowded with tourists after a busy day sightseeing. We would definately stay at this hotel again on returning to Venice as we had such a fantastic time here.

<Content>Lovely hotel The Antiche Figure is a marvelous small hotel. Our room faced the Grand Hotel, and although this meant that it was occasionally noisy, I enjoyed having the view. The room was very comfortable. The bathroom was quite large for a European hotel. The staff were accommodating, although some were more helpful and knowledgable than others.I made the reservations directly with the hotel, with ease, and was provided the same rate as an online service had advertised.The hotel is located a bit far from the action in Venice (the Piazza), but we did not mind walking. Others might find the distance to be a problem.

<Content>If only all 3 star hotels were like this Great Hotel. We stayed just two nights in Venice at the end of a long European vacation. We had a room with a view of the Grande Canal--which I would recommend spending the extra for. The room was great. We had stayed in five star hotels which were not a whole lot better than this one. The staff was wonderful, the room was very clean, the location was great, and of course Venice was awesome. The hotel exceeded our expectations and we would stay there again without even looking at other hotels.

<Content>Great Location! Great Hotel! We loved Hotel Antiche Figure! Located directly across the Grand Canal from the train station, it was convenient for our arrival to and departure from the city, in addition to providing a great base for exploring all areas of Venice. There are vaporetto stations directly across the water, a bridge 50 m away, and restaurants and stores close by. The staff were friendly and spoke English well, and the breakfast the hotel provided was nice. The room was spacious, as was the shower--something we did not find in other Italian hotels. Excellent for the price!

<Content>Could'nt have been better Stayed here for 3 nights in June and could'nt have picked a better location. The staff were very friendly and helpful when required, the room was outstanding with a full view of the canal it was very entertaining just to lean out the window and watch all the boats and people going by. They certainly go all out with decoration in venice even the bathroom had a chandelier it was all very posh. The breakfast provided was good to always nice to have it included.The location was great for restaurants or just wandering around siteseeing. I highly recommend this hotel

<Content>A Lovely Little Hotel in Venice My sister and I just returned from a long weekend in Venice, and were very pleased with the Hotel Antiche Figure. The rooms are not huge, but very clean and well-appointed. The staff are friendly, professional, and very helpful (special thanks to Gwendolina (sp?) and Alessandro). It is well worth booking a canal view room. We arrived before our room had been vacated (checkout is noon), and agreed to stay our first night in a non-canal view room, which was small, but we wanted to get out and about. The next day we were moved to room 412, which is one of the largest rooms, canal view, no balcony, non-smoking. The buffet breakfast, which is included in the price, is from 7 until 10, and includes croissants, rolls, yogurt, cheese, fruit, cereal, cold cuts, etc. The hotel is across the Grand Canal from the railway station, and a short walk from the bus station in Piazzale Roma, but our room was quiet nevertheless. If you arrive by train, walk over the Scalzi bridge -- the hotel is next to the church with the green dome. If you arrive by bus (take the blue ATVO express bus from Marco Polo airport, 3 euros) just walk down the Grand Canal toward the aforementioned church. We highly recommend Ristorante Ribo, which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel, in Fondamenta Minotto. It isn't cheap (dinner for two, with antipasto, pasta, main course, a bottle of wine and dessert costs about 140 euros) but well worth it-- we ate dinner there twice, and the seafood is delicious. We will certainly stay at Antiche Figure again.

<Content>All-around great hotel We loved our stay at this hotel! It is beautifully decorated in Venetian decor and looks newly renovated. The place was extremely clean, breakfast offered a good variety of foods, and the staff was friendly and professional. It's an EXCELLENT value for the price. Its location on the grand canal across from the train station was perfect for us since we arrived by train and it was easy to find the hotel (not something you can say about many places in Venice.) It is not in the middle of the main tourist attractions, which I preferred. Yet, we were still able to walk to everything or take the vaporetto (water bus) next to the hotel in order to easily get around the city. I can't recommend this place highly enough!

<Content>Problems with reservations - again Having booked a four night stay at the hotel I was a little nervous at comments about reservations - therfore I did e-mail about four weeks before arrival. However on arrival at the hotel we were told there was problems with the booking and we had been 'upgraded' to the Bellini - which was just across the bridge. Therefore I cannot rate the hotel. Where we transferred was adequate though the rooms were small. I would say though that Venise was absolutely stunning. The three day pass on the vaporetto was probably the best bargain of the holiday. And we were treated to an amazing thunder storm on the Thursday night. All I can say is check your booking carefully

<Content>What a gem Stayed for two nights July 18 / 19th. for our 30th Wedding Anniversary We requested one of the only two balcony front rooms 201  202 in an email sent 2 weeks ago. They obliged  the room was perfect. All the decorations inside the Hotel are 5 star. - The wall coverings in the bedroom are fabric ( slightly padded ) not wall paper  all the switches  fittings are gold plated.This hotel has a magical feel to it. The location is perfect for the airport bus ( 5 mins walk over two bridges)Gondola station outside Hotel.Water bus to all sites across bridge but do walk on both sides of Grand Canal to Rialto, fully sign posted . ( RHS - Narrow alleys  passages or cross over bridge  down LHS for shops  cafes )In the evening sit  people watch outside the Hotel - Food  drink prices in Venice are expensive but this is paradise - Enjoy.

<Content>Number 11? Don't think so! I can't believe this hotel ranks number 11 of all hotels in Venice. The rest must be pretty poor then as this is just your average bland hotel. The rooms are a reasonable size, but cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired. We actually found traces of poo on the toilet after checking in! Disgusting.Reception staff are nice, but the waitress in the breakfast area was unbelievably unfriendly and seemed to get great pleasure in trying to make as much noise as possible when setting or cleaning the tables. She never even made the effort to come round and offer us any coffee or tea. Most guests had to ask for plates, orange juice was not refilled etc. The breakfast was the most dissapointing I've ever had. Cheap quality and little selection. The one good thing about this hotel is its location (right accross the train station). All in all a very unimpressive hotel and I will not bother returning. Sooooo not worth the money.

<Content>Great Hotel! We stayed in this lovely hotel for 4 nights in may 2005. The location was perfect for us as we arrived from Rome by train and just had to walk over the bridge to the hotel. This was great as we had 2 heavy bags with us. We got the bus to the airport when the holiday was over and the bus station is also very close. The staff were very friendly and helpful and gave us a great map with directions to all the sights. The room was much better than we expected it to be and was absolutely spotless. The breakfast was fine but it was difficult to get a table some mornings. But we were in no hurry anyway. We walked everywhere and found some restaurants that were great value - there were plenty of locals eating there too and the food was amazing. We never ate near Piazza san Marco as the food and wine is a rip off there - much better value in the small squares of Dorso Duro. I would recommend this hotel to all my friends and will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Very Good Value Indeed My parents stayed here in June to celebrate a 70th Birthday. We had seen the reviews on Tripadvisor and booked on the basis of these recommendations. Glad to say, its all true. My parents had a wonderful time, were well looked after, and thoroughly recommend the hotel. My brother, who stayed somewhere else was sick-as-a-parrot.

<Content>Excellent Time We had a wonderful stay here--we upgraded to two front rooms, which were very lovely, spacious and not that noisy. The staff was very friendly and helpful, good for dinner recommendations, did the trip to Murano--very nice.We had an overnight train to Rome and we were able to leave our luggage with them after we checked out and we sat out front and watched the nightlife. I would definitely stay there again!

<Content>beyond expectations ANGELA AND NEIL HAMMOND STOKE ON TRENT Returned 7/6/2005This fabulous hotel was beyond our expectations,very friendly most accomodating staff,lovely room,excellent location easy to find,get the bus from the airport to piazza roma 3 euros each 20mins, head for the green domed church.Breakfast a bit boring same everyday and only 9 tables for 22 rooms so a bit of a scramble some mornings.We took advantage of the tourist waterbus pass 22 euros each for 72hrs brilliant we went everywhere on them even to the islands (well worth a visit particularly Lido de Venizia) a bit crowded at times but fun. Although the gondola was a bit expensive 80 euros for 45mins a must we went on an independant one not the companies on the waterfront this was great the only was to see the back waterways not accessible on foot. Its extremely safe to walk about this beautiful city but so easy to get lost without a street map as every street looks the same. We chose this hotel after reading other reviews, the helpful hints and information were invaluable, will certainly check when booking any other trips. Beware Venice is expensive as you would expect particularly if you eat at canal side restaurants but still a fantastic place to see and visit well worth every penny.

<Content>What a charming hotel! We've just returned from 3 days at the Antiche Figure and we loved it! It's absolutely charming and elegant and spotlessly clean. It's across from the train station which was perfect for us since we were coming into Venice by train from Florence and all we had to do was wheel our suitcases across the bridge and practically into the door of the hotel. It's true that you will have to ride a few stops longer on the vaporetto to get to some places but hey, it's not exactly a hardship riding down the Grand Canal of Venice. That said, if you like to walk, it's not difficult to walk to the Rialto area. We did it several times. I had originally booked a room on the city-side of the hotel because I was concerned about noise since my husband is a light sleeper but my younger (but wiser) sister insisted that it was a waste to book a Canal-front hotel and not get a Canal-front room. I had originally booked on expedia but since Venice was our last stop in Italy and we were only going to be there three nights, I threw caution to the winds and paid 45EUR extra per night for a deluxe room. And was I ever glad! Our room (room 201, I think) had a little balcony that looked out onto the Grand Canal, gondolas and vaporetti. The room was large with a king-sized bed, an extra single bed, lots of closet space and a beautiful Murano-glass chandelier. The bathroom was incredible -- all wood and marble with three matching glass chandelier sconces on the mirror and a large bath/shower. Noise was no problem at all. It's not a particularly noisy area, despite the busy streets, and the windows are double-glazed with heavy wooden shutters that can be closed as well.The lobby and lobby bar were charming (check out the painted ceiling beams in the lobby) as were the breakfast rooms. The breakfast buffet, although not the fullest we had on our trip, was certainly ample -- soft boiled eggs, baked goods, cheese, ham, cereal, juice fruit. My only complaint (and it's very minor) was that they had a machine that made coffee, cappuccino, espresso and hot chocolate and I would have prefered 'hand-made'. The Antiche Figure is plain on the outside but very charming and elegant on the inside. We loved it and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>A Wonderful Choice!! We stayed at this wonderful hotel for four nights beginning June 2nd. Our 2nd floor Canal View room with a balcony was splendid (had to pay a hefty exta 50 euros per night for this type room). Very nice bathroom with deep tub and plush towels. Room was made up promptly each day and was spotless.Desk staff was always helpful, booked classical concert tickets for us, and appeared to be more than willing to answer our questions.Being away from the crowds around more tourist areas of Venice was a real plus and the walk to the Rialto from either side of the Canal was enjoyable. As we arrived from Rome via train, the location could not have been more convenient. Out the front door of the train station, over the bridge to the left and back to the right again and we were standing in the lobby five minutes later! The staff and this hotel added to a wonderful time in a wonderful city.

<Content>Wonderful boutique hotel After spending 6 days touring Tuscany we settled into our room at the Antiche Figure and were pleasantly surprised. We had booked through our local AAA and not knowing what to expect found the room small but very well appointed. Although the bathrooms were small, they were aptly appointed. The beds were very comfortable and the A/C worked nicely. The hotel staff was wonderful and the breakfast was sufficient and tasty. We knew the hotel fronted the Grand Canal but did not request a canal room. So our only regret was our view was of the side of an adjacent building. We should have been smarter and requested a canal view room. Our mistake. But we didn't spend much time in our room anyway!The bar/cafe off the lobby offered a wonderful Bellini, not to be missed. A perfect end to a beautiful day.Would definitely stay at the hotel again!

<Content>Beyond expectation! My husband and I had a wonderful experience in this hotel.Rooms were small but extremely clean and wonderfully decorated.Hotel provides a ride to the Murano Island to see one of the factories.Train Station is right across.Also,Gondoliers charge less around this hotel.In areas like San Marco and rialto,the gondoliers were charging 100 to 120 E.The minimum rate is 80 E.Transportation to the main attractions from the hotel was great.Staff was warm and gave helpful tips.We will definitely go back and stay in this wonderful hotel.Made us love Venice even more.Thanks to the lady in the reception who was very warm and friendly

<Content>Fantastic, good locaiton, fab room JUST RETURNED TODAY, The Hotel is very well sited close to one of the 3 bridges over THE GRAND CANAL, Within easy walking distance of the Bus Station from The Airport and set overlooking The Grand Canal... The Reception staff were very helpfull and courteous, (NO HARD SELL), We took advantage of the 'FREE' trip to the glass factory... Great in a Water Taxi!! Try to avoid the Factory's hard sell ALL the Glass is CHEAPER OUT AND ABOUT ON MURANO.. Our Bedroom was very nice, with a splendid bathroom, can be a bit noisy but what do you exspect and the windows are double glazed, Another time we would ask for a 4TH floor room to avoid plumbing noise from above.. About 5Mins down the right hand side of the Hotel is a great eatery called OSTARIA AL VECIO POZZO well worth a visit...

<Content>Upon arrival in venice we felt as we were part of film set we stayed at the fantastic hotel to celebrate my 40th birthday, i wanted the occasion to always be memorable, the hotel and staff certainly made it that way ,as recommended by other Trip Advisor users i would arrive by the express bus to Pizzale Roma and walk across to the hotel it is only a few mins away and you will find it straight away if you look for the green dome of the church of St simeon piccolo which is next door.

<Content>A true value in in pricey Venice My wife and I stayed at the Antiche Figure for only two nights on April 12, 13, 2005. As with all of the hotels in our two week Italian tour, Tripadvisor was a factor in hotel selection. This hotel was THE nicest one we stayed in during our trip, and we selected hotels from the top of Tripadvisor's list in Rome, Sorrento, and Florence in the $250/nt price range.The hotel is very well located to all forms of transportation, the train station and vaporetto stop right across the canal, and the bus/ land taxi station only a couple of blocks away in the Piazzale Roma. Getting to your hotel in Venice can be a real pain, but the Antiche Figure is ridiculously easy to get to no matter how you arrive in Venice. There is loads of shopping and eating three minutes walk away. We had reserved a Canal view balcony room several weeks prior and reconfirmed via e-mail two weeks before our stay. No Problem! The room far exceeded our expectations, it was lavishly appointed in true Venetian style, spotlessly clean and all of the amenities were in perfect working order. One could spend nearly twice as much for the same room closer to the Rialto bridge or San Marco, but there is no reason to do so if you can book this Hotel! It offers the true Venice experience with the added benefit of fronting on one of the widest and longest canal-side promenades in the city (Great people watching).We preferred to hear to the sounds of Venice at night by leaving the balcony door open, but if noise bothers you (which is not that much to begin with), everything is double-paned and you can close the door/window and shut out the noise.The staff is very helpful and make every effort to make sure your needs are met. Thank You, Hotel Antiche Figure for making our too short stay in Venice so fabulous!!

<Content>Style and quality...! My wife and I stayed here for 6 nights at the end of March. We booked direct and very much on the strength of other TripAdvisor reports. We were not disappointed. There were no problems with not getting the room we'd asked for - though I did send an email about a week before our trip to make sure that everything was o/k. On our arrival, Alessandro on reception was very welcoming and ready with informative and helpful advice, and this set the scene for the rest of our stay - the hotel staff were always friendly and very efficient. The location is excellent; only about 5 minutes away from either the bus or train stations, so no need to trundle your luggage over bridges for miles before you reach the hotel! Yet for all that, it still has a very strong feel of Venice by virtue of its position right on the Grand Canal, with its view of the Scalzi bridge. And after a day's exploring, it was great to sit at the pavement tables outside the hotel, with an ice cream and coffee and just watch the world go by!Our room was typically Venetian in style, with a little balcony overlooking the Grand Canal. Very romantic, but, if you're a light sleeper, be aware that there can be some noise from canal traffic (the vaporetta stop is opposite the hotel, and there's a gondala jetty just outside). Take a tip, close the outside window shutters and this may help to bring the sound down to a manageable level.Breakfast was included. This was a cold buffet breakfast, but we thought it was more than adequate - a very good selection, very well presented, and as much coffee as you want - and the breakfast room was bright and extremely clean and very distinctively furnished.Eating out in Venice can be a bit of a lottery. It can be very expensive for food which is nothing special (and I don't mean pizza or pasta, etc) and for service which can be frankly indifferent, and fresh vegetables seem to be a scarcity on most menus. Shop around and find what suits you and your pocket. We found an excellent place 15 minutes stroll away; the Alla Palazzina on Ponte delle Guglie (good food and at the end of the meal you weren't hassled for tips!); or for lunch, and if you're down in the Arsenale area, the osteria da Amelia e Sergio (not a lot of English spoken, but you can soon make yourself understood. The bill came to euros and cents! A novelty, and they very kindly said Oh, just pay us the euros!We loved Venice, what a fascinating city. And when we next visit, we'll make sure we stay at this hotel again. As travellers, we have high standards and high expectations, but we would fully recommend this hotel without any hesitation.Enjoy it, and enjoy Venice.

<Content>Hard to beat for price Stayed in the Antiche Figure for two nights 16-17 March 2005. It is cleaner, more modern, and has a friendler more professional staff than any other three star I have ever stayed in in Italy. It would be highly unlikely to find a less expensive, nicer hotel on the Grand Canal. If it could improve its booking system and elaborate its breakfast buffet it might even merit another star.

<Content>Problems with Reservation (again!) As with another reviewer who contributed on September 14, 2004, I had a confirmed reservation at the hotel with a Grand Canal View. I had booked this at a special Expedia rate a month prior to my arrival and had confirmation of the booking. However upon arrival (I arrived at 6 pm) I was told that there had been a problem with my reservation and they had booked me into another hotel five minutes away. As it happens, this was also on Piazze Roma and instead of a view of the Grand Canal, I was afforded views of the main bus station out front and a car park out back. I too was upgraded to a 'Suite', although in any 4* hotel in the USA this would have qualified as a normal room in terms of its size. Although this was perfectly acceptable to me as I was there on business (the room at the 'new' hotel was clean and recently renovated, and the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful) I have to admit I would have been furious had I been there on a romantic weekend.I have raised this issue with Expedia and asked them to investigate. However, in the meantime, if you really want to stay at this hotel and have a room with a view, I too would encourage people to also receive confirmation (preferably in writing) directly from the hotel that the hotel have not only received the reservation (which undoubtedly they will have), but that the hotel will honour it and not move the guest to another hotel.

<Content>First visit to Venice For our first ever visit to Venice, my partner and I booked 4 nights at the Antiche Figure for 4 nights in February 2005 through Expedia.THe hotel is conveniently situated for all forms of transport.Both the Railway and Bus Stations are within a 5 minute walk. The No5 bus brings you direct from Marco Polo Airport. They run at least evey 30 minutes during the day and the fare is 2 Euros.Across the canal from the hotel is the Vaperetto Public Water Bus Stop at Ferrovia, right outside the rail station. Catch the No1 Vaperetto to travel down the Grand Canal towards the Rialto Bridge and St Marks Square. A 3 day pass costs 22 Euros, a really good buy.We both thought the hotel was fantastic. Recently refurbished to a very high standard both the rooms we had were of a good size, spotlessly clean and nicely furnished.We stayed for 2 nights on the fourth floor at the side of the hotel. This was perfectly fine but we enquired about the availability of a room overlooking the canal. Subject to availability this can be arranged for a supplement of 25 to 50 Euros per night.(Per room not person).The view that this room gave down the canal was fantastic. I would recommend paying the supplement for at least part of your stay if not all.Like most visitors we were bowled over by Venice and delighted to have stayed in such a nice hotel. We would recommend it to anybody.

<Content>Loved It but..... i think it's haunted We stayed at this hotel in June of 2004 for 2 days. Tucked up in the upper most corner suite overlooking the canal and train station. The room and hotel staff were fabulous!! And the location was very convenient for us. The hotel staff even arranged for a day trip for us to Muranno Island to visit the glass factories. The hotel itself was very clean, comfortable and since we had the deluxe suite, very spacious and well decorated. Wonderful chandeliers and marble in the enormous bathroom, lovely textiled walls and draperies....... One problem though..... Both nights I woke up with a sense that there was someone else in the room with us. An eerie sensation that I could not shake even after I woke my boyfriend out of a sound sleep and made him turn on all the lights and check the room over. At one point I swear I could see a shadowy figure in the corner of the room. I feel silly even typing this, but it's true, and not so overwhelming that it would ever stop me from staying this this lovely hotel again. Enjoy you time in this unique hotel...it is one of a kind!!

<Content>Wonderful small hotel! My partner and I spent three nights at the Antiche Figure in October, and will definitely stay there again. Though I was at first apprehensive about staying near the train station, the location turned out to be ideal. We were well away from the crowds of San Marco, and were able to explore the quiet canals and streets that we would have missed had we stayed in a more touristy neighborhood. Our top-floor room was small but cozy and beautifully furnished, with an oblique view of the Grand Canal and a lavish - though tiny - marble bathroom. Breakfast was ample and tasty, and the staff, led by Alessandro, was consistently friendly and helpful. We can't wait to return.

<Content>Not bad A bit far from the city center (This could be view as a picky statement, since the hotel is right across from the train station and located ON the grand canal)If I go back again, I would probably try something in San Marco, but I would not hesistate to stay here again. The renovation was clearly well done and everything about the room is perfect.

<Content>Bellisimo!-BRAVO! This hotel was in a GREAT location!!! The room was VERY clean and comfortable. The bathroom was SPOTLESS and the shower had excellent water pressure. The staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. The breakfast was sufficent. This hotel was FANTASTIC!!!! Helpful hints:From Marco Polo Airport take the BLUE BUS to Piazzeli Roma. Be sure to have Euro's in change to buy your ticket-3 Euro's per person.Behind the Piazzeli Roma ticket booth is a walkway along the Grand Canal-make a right, go over two small bridges and you are there-on your right. It is directly across the Grand Canal from the Santa Lucia Train Station. This area, Santa Croce, is in walking distance of the Rialto and San Marco area. If you don't want to walk, take the vaperatto-SP? #1-this stops frequently along the Grand Canal or #82 which makes fewer stops along the Grand Canal. ***You can buy a 72 hour ticket for 22 Euros/per person at the Piazzeli Roma ticket booth.****To the right of the Santa Lucia Train Station there are plenty of shops and restaurants.Try to walk. You will get to see more of the canals and homes. You can't get lost!! There are destination signs throughout the city. When wanting to return to Marco Polo Airport buy a bus ticket at the Piazelli Roma ticket booth. It will cost 2 Euro's per person. You will need to board the YELLOW BUS #5-Aeroporto.This is a beautiful city-ENJOY!!!!!!

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed at the hotel in October 2004. Location is opposite from train station over a bridge. All bridges have stairs (no ramp) and you must drag your luggage up/down. The front desk was very nice. Breakfast was good. Had originally booked a room in the hotel, but arrived early and got a room in the apartment. We got it for the same price, very quiet and very roomy (2 bedrooms, washing machine, iron, refrig, stove, kitchen). The apartment is in the same building. Never got to see what the hotel rooms were like, so no comment. It was nice to have a big place after staying in a few other places in Italy and having small places. I guess the key is to not look like a target. Booked hotel through hotels ($140e night). If you think you are going to have to change your schedule, it is easier to find your best price online and then call the hotel directly (011-39-041-2759486) and book it. This gives you flexibility with the hotel to extend/decrease your stay without hotels.com policy.

<Content>Excellent in every way The location of the hotel is excellent. Take a bus from the Airport to Piazzale Roma, cross the bridge and you are there. The first impression was very good of a clean hotel. It was slightly spoiled by reception asking us if we would like to upgrade to a canal view room at a discounted rate (we had a side view). After a long journey we didn't want to feel a sales pressure. However there was no pressure and we stayed in our original room. It was smallish but very adequate, nicely furnished with a very nice bathroom. We had a good view of the Grande Canal.Transport is very easy. You are very close to the train station, vaparetto and just a 10 minute walk from the bus station.We stayed for 4 nights, September 2004. The breakfasts were excellent, cereals, yogurts, fruit, meats, cheese, croissants etc. Staff were helpful and friendly. We would certainly go back to this hotel.

<Content>Great Little Hotel Stayed here for three nights beginning August 31. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. The location was perfect, across the Grand Canal from the train station. Vaporetto stops five minutes away across the canal. Very helpful staff. The rooms were comfortable and the baths with the Murano fixtures luxurious. This is a four star hotel for a three star price in a perfect location.

<Content>Buyer beware.... I had confirmed reservations at this hotel through Expedia. I chose it based upon reviews on this site and proximity to the train station. I was also hoping for a room overlooking the Grand Canal. Upon showing up, the hostess informed me they had problems confirming my room. I wasn't sure what she meant as she has my reservation but somehow they didn't have a room for me. I couldn't explore further due to Italian/English Communication barrier. Needless to stay they provided a room at another hotel (with an upgrade room to a junior suite to sweeten the blow). The hotel was about 5-10 walk away and was conveniently next to the Venice bus station off the beaten path. I'm curious about the mixup, and I guess I'll never find out, but my recommendation is to confirm you actually will be staying at this hotel before your trip.
