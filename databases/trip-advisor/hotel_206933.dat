<Content>Nice Business Hotel - long way from the tourist trail Stayed for 2 nights in this Hotel. Nice rooms, spacious, clean and well serviced.It is a little noisy in the Hotel, you can hear every door banging along the whole floor which is a little annoying if you are looking for a lie in.The coffee shop is nice, good coffee and great pastries.The location is far from the tourist spots, but the bus tours and metro are only a 10 min walk away.Little disturbing that a number of gentlemens clubs are right on the doorstep but to be fair they seemed discreet and no hassle even passing late at night.Overall nice business hotel, clean conveneint and good service.

<Content>Very efficient hotel, but watch... I thought that this hotel was very efficient, clean, quiet and situated in a pleasant, residential neighborhood - far from the touristy, congested city center. We walked the routes to the famous sites and enjoyed other sights along the way. It is not necessary to take a taxi. The staff was always pleasant and helpful to us. There was a terrific shower. The hotel did not have much ambience, but who cares?My only qualm (which is major) with this hotel is that they did not explain that the buffet, continental breakfast was NOT included in the room price. For the cost of this breakfast, forgetaboutit. It is expensive and not worth participating in this hotel feature.

<Content>Noisy and wouldnt stay again After reading the reviews we decided to give Derby Hotel a go anyway because we have always experienced some noise in hotel rooms in big cities in Europe, but this place was the WORST we have ever experienced. The noise either kept us awake at night, or woke us up when we finally got to sleep. The noise was not only from the street outside (which is actually a nice residential street), but also constant noise from the uncarpeted corridors and also there is a lack of soundproofing between the rooms. The fact that the hotel was quite removed from the main sights and public transport and that the staff were not friendly only compounded our disappointment during our stay.On the positive side, the rooms were clean and the hotel was in great condition.

<Content>NOT GREAT FOR A FOUR STAR HOTEL we recently returned from staying at this hotel.First impressions on arrival were very pleasing, there was my wife and i, plus our 1 year old child. I booked this hotel from their own website, so i saved 拢拢拢 they even provided a cot for our baby.The rooms were clean and well looked after. Apart from the mini bar, lcd tv and the hair dryer there was nothing else! I was hoping they had a kettle and a iron in the room. One of the reasons i wanted a kettle was to warm my childs food up. Every time i wanted hot water i had to ring room service, which would take time to bring the water. After a day or so, room service started to charge for hot water (鈧?) which i thought was nuts!! We used the pool which was across the road at the Grand Derby Hotel, which was fine, but the water in the pool was freezing and the lack of towels was amazing, considering there was only 3 other people there! Breakfast was brilliant and generally staff were pleasant!Personally i would not class this as a 4 Star Hotel.It would be useful to learn Spanish, as non of the house keeping staff did not speak English!

<Content>A great place to stay. We booked a 4 night stay in Barcelona at a last minute bargain price. We weren't too sure what the hotel would be like, as is often the case with last minute deals! However we were very happy with what we got!Our first impression as we arrived was of a hotel that was smart clean, and possibly under other circumstances out of our price range (although I can't remember figures now, I am sure the normal rates aren't too bad). As you can imagine we were pleased with our bargain. The rooms were immaculate - our only complaint being that the previous guest had used the mini bar and the half full bottle of gin that they had used was sitting in the fridge when we arrived. Other than that, no complaints whatsoever.We only ate breakfast at the hotel on the first morning, after that it was out and about grabbing food on the go! It was lovely though and perhaps had we not been so keen to take in all the sites we may have had breakfast there more often.There is no pool at the Derby, but you can use the pool across the road at the Grand Derby. It is a very small pool though, and overlooked by apartments on all sides. We only used is once, but this was not really an issue for us as we didn't go to Barcelona to lounge by a pool! All in all a really nice place to stay, the only off putting thing were the random sculptures in the foyer!

<Content>very far from the centre barcelona itself is absolutely fabulous. Me and my friend both 24 have just come back we had a great time with all the sights, shopping and sangria. but the biggest downfall was how far away the hotel is, we were always in taxis , of a day its fine to walk but as its on a back street we felt it unsafe to walk of a evening. would reccomend people to stay closer to the centre. x

<Content>Nice hotel A lovely hotel, GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY!!Rooms are lovely, with a HUGE bath which is nice to soak in after all the walking we did. If you're after a room with a nice view, this is NOT the hotel for you as it's in the middle of a residential area.Only negative is that you have a 15/20min walk to the nearest metro station BUT it doesn't take very long to get into the main city centre hustle/bustle areas.A cute little cafe is next door serving light snack in the morning which is nice if you don't require a 'breakfast.

<Content>Agree that this is not 4 star! Hotel is as you would expect for a 3 star class. Rooms are clean, but beware of the noise if you are on the road side (there are a few bars/restaurants in the street and a bottle recyling bin which doesnt help with noise control!)Location is about 20min walk to La Ramblas...7鈧?taxi ride.Breakfast is good but not worth the 14鈧?br/>

<Content>Not a 4 star hotel At the most this hotel is a superior 2 star. There are very little tourist leaflets or information on the stand in the hotel or at the Gran Derby across the road. The staff are non communicative even when spoken to. Unless you have booked a superior room, you have to ask for a CD player. I would recommend booking a superior room if there are 2 of you. The standard double rooms are very small. Ask for a room on the 7th floor as they all have a private terrace with table and chairs and the rooms are larger. Room service meals are good value and decent sized portions but not a great deal of choice. The cafe next door (which is part of the hotel) only displays their menu in Spanish and doesn't give prices, so beware. The pool at the Gran Derby is about a quarter of the size of a normal pool and there are only 8 loungers and a table and 4 chairs so get there early at the height of the season. The hotel is a 25 minute walk from La Ramblas. On the plus side, the toiletries are nice.

<Content>great hotel lovely hotel to stay in, very clean, well looked after, most staff spoke english and were very polite and helpful. swimmimg pool was small but lovely exactly how it looks in the picture. it was situated about 10-15 minutes from the ramblas (by taxi) and costs about 5-6 euros by taxi, make sure you take a map to let taxi know which hotel you want to go back to., you can also grab a taxi right outside hotel. very pleased with our stay.

<Content>Don't expect a pre-breakfast swim! The hotel is spotlessly clean and efficient but somehow without atmosphere. Don't believe what they say about a swimming pool. It's in the Gran Derby over the road and is about 2 metres square!Good coffee shops next door and over the road for breakfast is you don't have it included in your stay -(we didn't - and were too scared to ask the price of the hotel buffet breakfast - after seeing the prices of the items in the mini bar!)It seems a long way away from the centre of town but the 59 bus stops close by and operates very regularly - about every 10 minutes. Do get a bus routes map from the information centres.

<Content>Ok room, terrible service The decor of the hotel and the rooms were nice, but if you're after any kind of service then dont stay here. Firstly, when checking-in the front desk staff were incredibly unhelpful. We had a problem with our phone which took a lot of time to get fixed. The staff members were quite rude when we asked them to fix it. The room description said pay-per-view movies which the room did not have and when I enquired about it the front desk staff said that they had not renewed their subscription, which was not acceptable. There is a really nice bar on the ground floor which did not open at any time during our stay. The hotel is not in the centre of Barcelona so I would recommend staying in a more central hotel even if they have a lower star rating. The only thing that I really liked about the hotel was the housekeeping staff. They were really friendly and helpful.

<Content>Top Quality Hotel My family and I stayed at the Derby in Feb 2005 for four nights, we booked two adjoining rooms and we were delighted with them. Excellent rooms, full size beds and a decent bathroom with full size baths. The rooms were fully serviced every day.The hotel itself was of a very high standard and was very quiet.The reception staff were as helpful as possible, information on shopping centres, restaurants, etc. They organised a Hire Car for us, at a very good rate, and looked after the paperwork for the collection.The hotel is a little outside the Main Shopping area, but it is only 5 Euro by cab and there is a small rank outside the door.We could not believe reviews of this hotel which complained about various things. We would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>A Pleasure to stay here ! I can't beleive some of the reviews I have read on the Derby hotel ! My experience was one of pleasure. I found the hotel to be clean and comfortable and the staff to be very helpful. I was in Barcelona with a group of friends for a long weekend and had a superb time which was greatly added to by being able to come back to the Derby and relax after a long day's exploring or a night out .The rooms are sound proofed and I didnt hear any noise at all,OK I was in a room to the rear of the building and not one at the front overlooking the road.But Loreto is not a busy road and was very quiet when I was coming home for the night at 4.30AM !!!!!!!If I had one thing to say against the Derby it would be that for some people it could be a bit too far from the centre of the tourists hot spots.If you are on a budget you could find your cash being eaten into considerably if you were to take a taxi each time you wanted to go to the city centre.I was only there for a long weekend and I enjoyed the 30min walk into town as we could see the sites on our walk in. but I would think if you were on a longer stay the walk in would soon loose its appeal and would take a lot of time off your holiday.But that is not a critisism of the Derby Hotel.It is in very easy walking distance of the Diagonal and the Nou camp and a minutes walk to the Bus touristic stops (both routes) which take you to all the best sites of Barcelona. I am sorry the other reviewers have not had the experience I had of this Hotel, I wish I was back in Barcelona now and back at the Derby !!!

<Content>Staff need to learn how to serve customers Worst hotel we have stayed in. Staff were really unhelpful and did not care. They could not even help to provide an iron. This hotel is rated as a four star but this is wrong. Hotel should be rated as a 1 star and that is being generous. Hotel staff were not concerned at all about the lack of service. Hotel needs new management to get staff trained properly and to learn how to serve CUSTOMERS.

<Content>Dissappointing Having just spent two nights at the Hotel Derby it is a relief to be home. Described as a 'quiet hotel' I would not want a noisey one! The well out of the centre location is very close to a busy main road and the 'soundproofed' rooms do little to stop noise from outside and the terrible noise from the wood floored corridors,the plumbing is very very noisey - with you hearing the bathrooms floors above. The rooms were clean but small dark and depressing. The staff were fairly helpful although spoke poor English.I would not recommend the Hotel Derby and would suggest the Hotel Colon were I had a far better experince.

<Content>Nice Parquet Room 4 star (USD100) nice room with safe.. we could locked our passports and money in the room. helpful staff. A bit far from main tourist area but its convenient as both the blue and red stops of Bus Turistic (open-top tourist bus) are nearby. Also bus #59 brings you right into La Ramblas area.

<Content>nice area but small rooms! Outside tourist area, you need a cab to go to city centre!! Nice area, neer shops like Gucci etc but i thought it was too far away from everything! Rooms are very small and the bathrooms low class! The staff was friendly if you tipped them...we booked a room incl breakf, but had to pay an extra 15euro p/p!!!! NOT OK! They did not except american express....This hotel is ****, but i thought is was more like a *** hotel.

<Content>Great choice outside tourist district The Hotel Derby is an excellent choice and I highly recommend it. So often the staff in 4-star hotels are too stuffy yet here the people couldn't have been more helpful. If you want to be in the heart of the tourist district of Barcelona then this isn't for you, but if you prefer to do your sightseeing then escape to a peaceful haven away from it all then this is a fine choice.
