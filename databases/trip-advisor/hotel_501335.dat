<Content>Charming Hotel Misc We had 3 nights in Amsterdam for some rest after a long stretch of business travel. Hotel Mis was the perfect 'home away from home'!! Rachel  Pipijn's never ending enthusiasm  knowledge about Amsterdam added considerably to our stay and they really are the most thoughtful hosts who will offer you excellent local insight.Our room featured a glorious view over the canal, was cosy  included thoughtful touches that really added to our comfort. The location of the hotel is fabulously convenient to pretty much anything in Amsterdam. Amongst the highlights you can expect .. an excellent breakfast individually prepared and served until a very civilised midday! Soft, fluffy towels, heavenly pillows  quality linens. Super coffee both from the kitchen  in the rooms. Thoroughly engaging hosts!! We will definitely stay here again!!

<Content>This Place Is Fabulous! This place is a dream to stay in! Unbelievably convenient location... The rooms were lovely. We stayed in the 'Wonders' room. It was so cosy and nice.The owners of the Hotel Misc were incredibly friendly and very knowledgeable about the whole area. Excellent English.The breakfast was nice, the area is cool - I really can't fault it. I would highly recommend it to anybody seeking a romantic getaway. I wouldn't say it's suitable for children, but as a single person or a couple, you can't go far wrong here!Loved it! :)

<Content>Great start to our honeymoon My husband and I stayed at Hotel Misc for one night on our way to our honeymoon.Even though we arrived quite late, Pepijn had arranged for a taxi to pick us up at the airport and we were offered a brief tour of the city before checking in at the hotel.We stayed in the room called Wonders which has an Asian feel to it and was perfect to set the mood for our future travel. As it was late, Pepijn recommended us a tapas place but unfortunately the place was closed. Not to worry though, there are hundreds of eateries and restaurants close to the hotel and we sampled some Argentinian cuisine, was gorgeous.Anyway, back in the room we found plenty of free refreshments in the mini bar and a bottle of bubbly was waiting for us!The following day, Rachel treated us to an amazing breakfast. Over all this hotel does not look like much but it is all the personal touches brought by Rachel and Pepijn that made our stay so special.

<Content>Great boutique hotel, friendly staff We stayed for two nights in the Wonders room. Great little hotel, with modern/design oriented decor (one of the owners, Rachel, is in architecture school). Very clean. Fantasic location, 10 min walk to central train station. Only one street away from red-light district (don't be concerned, it is very safe there -and a nice neighborhood, lots of shops and good restraunts). Free WiFi. Great home-cooked breakfast. Best of all was the staff, helpful with directions and tips for places to go! I would stay here again if I come back to Amsterdam.

<Content>Fantastic Little Hotel This small hotel provides you with everything you could wish for on a city break - it is right in the heart of old Amsterdam, overlooking one of the canals, the room (Design) had everything including complementary snacks and a real coffee machine, and the service was intimate and exclusive but not irritating. Wonderful breakfast cooked right in front of you, oranges squeezed on demand, boat trip organised and left from outside the hotel. Small, unique, informal and relaxed and yet quietly catering to your every whim. A real find.Lucy and Richard.

<Content>Still a superb hotel We stayed again at the Misc as we loved it so much last year - and it did not dissapoint. We stayed in the Design room again which we love. Rachel and Pepjin were as before, such great hosts. I was staying for my birthday and was made to feel very special by them. A great breakfast anytime from 9 - Noon (and you are sitting in the kitchen/diner whilst it is cooked for you) set us up for the day and the complimentary mini bar helped with the munchies!!!There really is little I can add to what has already been said. It is in such a central, yet beautiful part of Amsterdam. Just a 10 minute walk from the station. We have yet to ride a tram in Amsterdam as eveything is so easy to walk too from here. The furthest we walked was the Van Goch musuem which in itself is a great walk.A fab, friendly, clean, relaxing, modern, personal, boutique hotel in the centre of town. Who could wish for more - we will be back!!

<Content>Nice but limited Stayed here while visiting Amsterdam in the Summer. The couple who run the place are quite nice (she more than he), and it is probably an excellent choice if you do not require some of the more basic hotel amenities (i.e., granola types will love it, 4 Seasons types will run for the door). Nice, basic rooms without a/c and small, functional bathrooms. One caveat, due to the proximity to the red light district, you may run into the periodic drunken lout ranting about ManU.

<Content>Outstanding experience, feeling better than home... The experience of staying at the Hotel Misc cannot be adequately described with words - it has to be lived in order to be evaluated properly. However, I will try to describe our experience with words, mainly because by doing so I will re-live the experience and all the beautiful feelings associated with it...Having been in Amsterdam before, it took me a long research to find the perfect hotel for my wedding trip. Deciding factors were: location, reviews and communication with the hotel. The hotel scored excellent in all areas. So, after seeing the pictures and considering my options, I decided to book the Rembrandt room, since both me and my wife love art, and the museums would be one of our major sightseeings during our trip.First, the location of the hotel is perfect - right in the middle of the city's center, just 5 minutes from practically everywhere: the Dam square, the Central Station, the Koningsplein  the Flower Market, the Rembrandtplein, the Waterlooplein, or even the Leidseplein and the Jordaan if you're like us and don't mind walking a bit more to get where you want. Even if you don't like walking, the hotel is next to the Nieuwmarkt, which means there's a taxi stand right across the street, to make up for the loss of a nearby tram stop. And for those who feel a little uncomfortable with staying at the edge of the Red Light District, it doesn't feel like that at all. You should be able to forget you're near the RLD just by using your common sense, like you would do in any big city.The hotel itself has only one drawback - the steep stairs. But of course this is Amsterdam, stairs are steep by default, and it's really not that bad once you get the hang of it. Other than that, our room was much more beautiful and convenient than I expected it to be, with fresh flowers on the table and a lovely view over the canal, a fridge with snacks  soft drinks, all toilet/bathroom necessities and the most comfortable double bed I've ever slept on. Each day we had a delicious late breakfast, and while we were out exploring the city, our room was cleaned/restocked for the day.Communication with Rachel and Pepjin couldn't have been better, from the beginning of the booking until the end of our trip. They both went out of their way to, not only accomodate us, but help us with everything we possibly needed, from providing  helping us customize boat tours, to offering us a laptop to use with the hotel's wireless Internet connection. It is because of their help  understanding that the surprise I planned for my wife was a huge success, and it is because of their hospitality that we will both remember this trip for the rest of our lives.Thank you Rachel  Pepjin for all the things you did for us and for all the trouble you went into helping us live a wonderful experience. We'll see you again in Amsterdam, hopefully sooner than we think ;)

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Superb hotel in the centre of Amsterdam. My wife and I stayed in one of the smaller rooms at the book of the building but there was plenty of room for two far-from-light travellers. The location is perfect, within walking distance of almost everything without feeling seedy due to the close proximity of the red light district. Our room was very clean and nicely furnished. What really made the trip special however was Rachel and Pepijn (the owners) who were fantastic. The breakfast they prepare is wonderful (we tended to eat late and get by with a light lunch) and they went to great lengths to find restaurants for us 鈥?take their advice, every recommendation turned out to be a good one. Also, if you have the chance to go on a canal trip, it is well worth it.

<Content>Oasis on the canal We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Misc for 7 nights. The owners were fantastic and gave us ideas and suggestions of where to go during our stay. They even arranged a 2 hour canal tour that we highly recommend! The garden rooms face the back and are a little smaller, but alot quieter. Note there is no air conditioning so can get a little warm in the summer months. There is a free standing fan provided in the room. The breakfast provided is delicious and catered to your choices. There is even a resident cat if you are missing your pets at home. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone who is planning on coming to Amsterdam. Just be prepared for steep stair climbing to your room, but totally worth the individually styled rooms. The location is prime and a short walk from Centraal station. Do not hesitate to stay here!

<Content>Wonderful place This hotel was wonderful, my husband and I stayed there last night and absolutely loved it. They were told it was our honeymoon and sent up a bottle of champagne then when we came back from our evening out there was a piece of chocolate cake... it was like every time we left we came back to a sweet little surprise. The owners were a very sweet couple. A full breakfast was provided and the fridge in our room was stocked with complimentary drinks. Everything was clean and the white bed linens were beautiful and comfortable. Overall it was fabulous.

<Content>All the great reviews are absolutely true! I chose Hotel Misc based on all the great reviews here, and it absolutely lived up to my (high) expectations.As others have mentioned, what makes this place so special are its owners, Rachel and Pepijn. They are friendly without being intrusive, incredibly helpful, and seemed genuinely interested in the goings-on and satisfaction of their guests. The breakfast they provided was fantastic: bread, meat, cheese, an egg cooked to order with bacon, and fresh baked croissants, not to mention cappucino, latte or any other kind of coffee, teas, and fresh squeezed orange juice. It all kept me going well into the afternoon.The hotel itself is well-situated in Amsterdam, within walking distance of most attractions. I was a bit apprehensive about its proximity to the Red Light District, but it was not an issue at all. My room was comfortable and bright, and the free mini-bar was an extra-special treat, stocked each day with sweet and savory snacks, fruit juices, sodas and water.I hope I have reason to return to Amsterdam and stay at Hotel Misc again! It's a very special place.

<Content>The "Misc" made Amsterdam Fantastic I used TripAdvisor extensively when planning our vacation to Amsterdam. In the end, we ended up staying at the Misc, arriving May 1st among the fallout from the Queens Brithday celebration the night before. This was the final stop after seeing 2 other European cities.While I wouldn't characterize Amsterdam as the easiest place to navigate, the Misc's location just off Nieuwmarkt gave us a great landmark to navigate towards. The location was a great home base for our walking expeditions through the city. We were never bothered by its proxiemety to the Red Light District.In the end, we weren't struck so much by the size or quality of the room itself, but were absolutly delighted with the Misc because of the amount of attention and interaction with had with our hosts there, Rachel and Pepijn. From the quality of the food they prepared, to the conversations that gave us real insight into Dutch culture, to the restaurant and beer recommendations they gave, to a very special boat charter, they definately went out of their way to distinguish their hotel as a unique experience. We could not believe how willing they were to go out of their way for us. Looking back , we agree that we got so much more out of Amsterdam because of our choice to stay at the Misc.

<Content>Great, Great, Great Fabulously located, the Hotel Misc is a must stay if you're in Amsterdam. The owners run a top quality establishment. It's a very private small hotel/bb. The breakfast is incredibly good and filling. Rachel, the owner, cooks a made to order fresh egg and bacon for you in the morning. There is also fresh squeezed oj which was my personal favorite, a selection of jams, cheeses, breads, fruit, teas and fresh baked croissants! It's fantastic. Every room has a mini fridge that is FREE and restocked every day with goodies like soda and brownies, so you can eat like you're on vacation. The hotel is well located and within walking distance to every major site. Although you have to enjoy walking because some sites are not right around the corner. The rooms are great, although more because of their unique furnishings than anything else. Each room has a different theme which is fun. We stayed in the baroque room which was large and quiet because it was at the back of the house. The bathroom was large, had great toiletries and the bed were SO comfortable. I highly recommend this place and would go back if we returned to Amsterdam. One word of caution, there are steep stairs up to the rooms, so if you can not walk well, this property would present some problems.

<Content>The Absolute Best! Everything said about this hotel in these reviews is absolutely true! The owners deliver the best customer service, the rooms are cozy, you couldn't ask for a better location, and the breakfast is excellent. I can't imagine that any other hotel in Amsterdam could pay as much attention to detail. The hotel is obviously very popular and was booked up the entire time we were there. I just hope there are rooms available next time I visit Amsterdam!

<Content>Best Small Hotel Anywhere We stayed at the MISC hotel in Amsterdam for 4 days in March along with my wife. I can simply say that it is the best small hotel we have ever stayed in. The hostess Rachel is from American and her husband is from Holland, so they are a perfect pair for American visitors. They were also unusually attentive to all of their guests 鈥搕hey even made breakfast for us before the usual opening time so that we could eat before cathing an early plane home.鈥攁nd are very knowledgeable about Amsterdam. The nice touches and amenities were almost too numerous to mention. They included free snacks, soft drinks, and mineral water in the room, a cooked to order breakfast served until noon, with great bread and pastries, umbrellas for the rainy March weather, and even a very friendly cat. The location of the hotel is great-right on a canal and walking distance of the train station, Dam square, and the museums and other sites. Our room was small, but very neat and quiet. The room was also a good value for the money, although somewhat expensive for Americans due to the low value of the dollar. If only they could do something about the rainy Spring weather!

<Content>A jewel in the heart of Amsterdam If you want to spend a few days in Amsterdam without the hassle of getting around by public transport, Hotel Misc is a jewel. The central location is great, the hosts welcoming, the rooms suitably quirky and the breakfasts sublime.Yes, the stairs are steep and the hotel is on the edge of the red light district, but this *is* Amsterdam, so you should feel short-changed if they weren't.We stayed in the Wonders Room (overlooking the small, rear courtyard) which was more than large enough (the en-suite in particular) and quiet. The free non-alcoholic minibar, coffee/tea maker and capacious safe (presumably in every room) are good touches, but nothing compared to the breakfasts (9am to noon): enough to keep you going until the evening. Then the hotel's location really shines; it's ideal for heading out into the under-explored eastern parts of the city centre for dinner and drinks alongside the locals.Although officially the facilities are only two-star, it really *does* feel like you're staying a few days with Pepijn and Rachel; a genuinely five-star experience.P.S. Did we mention the breakfasts?

<Content>A little gem! I used the feed back on this site to choose a place to stay in Amsterdam, and was not disappointed. My husband and I stayed at Misc for two nights, mid Feb.'08. What a little gem this place is. We arrived very early in the morning, and our room was not ready, so they put us in another one (Design) so we could rest up a bit. This is at the front of the building overlooking the canal. Was very impressed.The breakfast was excellent. Yes, you get fresh juice, eggs, cheeses, meats, coffee, bread, but Rachel's homemade spiced rhubarb jam was simply...heaven! While we were out exploring, they kindly moved our things to the room we had booked(Wonders) which is at the back, overlooking a really sweet garden courtyard. It was a very comfortable room, had all the amenities of a small hotel, and a good sized bathroom to boot! Misc definitley has location, location. It's about a 10 min. walk from the train station, and we did not need to take public transport at all. We walked every where. While we took the train in from the airport and walked to Misc on our arrival, we choose to take a taxi back to the airport for our departure because it was really, really, early. When it didn't arrive as planned we simply called Pepijn, and it was there in 10 mins.Rachel and Pepijn are excellent hosts and do their very best to make sure you enjoy your time at their place. Amsterdam is a wonderful city, and Misc is just the place to stay and enjoy it!

<Content>Out of this world! I have never had a better hotel stay than I had at the Hotel Misc over Thanksgiving Weekend, 2007. It was nothing short of spectacular.  My travel mate, Allison, and I stayed in the Rembrant Room, which overlooks the lovely Kloveniersburgwal canal -- right in the heart of the city. The room was spacious, clean and charmingly decorated with beautiful wooden furniture and framed Rembrant and Vermeer prints on the walls. It was quiet, save for the church bells ringing periodically in the distance. The room was perfect for resting or reading by the large windows after a busy day of sightseeing. It instantly felt like home. My favorite part of our stay was definitely the superb breakfast lovingly prepared for us each morning. In addition to freshly baked breads, homemade jams, fresh fruit, coffee and tea, guests are treated to an assortment of excellent cheeses and ham. Bacon and free-range eggs are made to order and served with the flakiest, most buttery croussants imaginable. Oh, and I forgot to mention the freshly squeezed orange juice. It was the perfect way to start the day -- truly heavenly. The minibar in our room was tuly complimentary. The delicious goodies inside (chocolates, cookies, sodas, water, potato chips) were restocked daily and, best of all, included in the cost of the room! I could not believe it. The minibar was very much appreciated when the late night munchies struck (a very common occurrance in Amsterdam)! The best part of our stay, however, had to be the warmth and hospitality with which we were welcomed by Rachel and Pepin. It is so clear that they love what they do. That love was evident in every aspect of our stay at the Hotel Misc. This was not my last time in Amsterdam, nor will it my last stay at the incredible Hotel MIsc!

<Content>Don't delay, book it now! As others have said, it's all been said before. Myself and my wife were there for our honeymoon, and stayed there for a total of 6 or 7 nights, split up over two weeks as we were using Amsterdam as our 'home base'. Stayed in 4 of the 6 rooms, and they were all very nice, as others have mentioned. Yes, the stairs are steep by North American standards, but if you've been in other old buildings in A'dam then you know they are all like that. Unlike other reviewers, we didn't find the canal view rooms excessively noisy, and the garden view rooms were very peaceful.Rachel and Pepijn were both fantastic hosts, and no request was refused. Breakfast was top quality, with fantastic breads and cheeses etc. The location is one of the highlights; very close to Nieumarket Square, which has some wonderful restaurants and coffee shops. Easy, easy, to get anywhere on foot, or use the very good trolley system. If you are a traveler who enjoys staying in places that give you a local flavour, as opposed to those that insist on 'the north american experience', then I highly recommend Misc.Mark  Dale

<Content>Perfect Location, excellent hosts Myself and my girlfriend stayed here for a long weekend in April and would definitely return.The hotel is in a great spot for exploring Amsterdam on foot (ie tourist spots in the day, bars  restaurants in evening) and is fairly close to the train station - we walked it in about 15 mins or so. If you're flying into Amsterdam I'd definitely take the train to the city rather than a taxi, unless you have loads of luggage.We thought the hotel was very reasonable (compared to other Amsterdam hotel prices). The room was clean, had all the facilities we required and had a nice view of the garden. I would book a room on the front of the hotel in the future (the retro room we booked was more student kitsch - but was absolutely fine)Breakfast was excellent and we really liked the breakfast space - really friendly and informal.I've saved the best for last though - Pepijn  Rachel are fantastic hosts. I had been in touch with them before we arrived and they provided some really good local knowledge on where best to visit, booked an excellent restaurant for us (Grietje I think?), and booked us tickets for a trip to Keukenhof.Overall - loved it and would recommend

<Content>Faultless Experience What can I say that hasn't been said already? This is a fantastic hotel, individual hotel that made my girlfriend and I's stay in Amsterdam very special indeed. We stayed in the romantic Baroque room which had an lovely view of the gardens; we would definitley recommend it for couples. The well stocked fridge and bathrobes were a really nice touch.The hosts were superb (i'm running out of superlatives now :-) ) - breakfast was always delicious - fresh fruit, local breads, eggs, bacon, cereal, crousaints, ham and cheese - there really is something for everyone. The location was well placed near the Central Station and behind the Red Light District. We will definitely be returning!!!

<Content>Not as good as expected - time for a lick of paint We stayed at Hotel Misc for 3 nights in the middle of June. We booked directly through the website and got one of the larger rooms (at the front, overlooking one of the canals) for 155 euros. We thought the price wasn't bad for a central hotel with breakfast and a free non-alcoholic mini bar.The hotel was easy to find and very central but we were a bit disappointed once we got inside the locked door (you have to ring, but then it only has 6 rooms, so you can't expect it to be manned all the time). The reception area was in a bit of a mess - lots of boxes of stuff and paperwork all over the place (this didn't change while we were there) - and after a brusque tour and a quick demonstration of the fridge and coffee machine we were left to ourselves. The room was disappointing (we got the Design room on the first floor). It's seen better days and having the shower room separate to the toilet made both seem very cramped. The hairdryer in the shower room was broken (it heated up but didn't blow and so was rather dangerous, though a replacement had been supplied), there were a few cracked wall tiles near the floor, cracks in the walls and general wear and tear marks. The fittings were more Ikea than boutique design hotel and the feel wasn鈥檛 exactly luxurious.Otherwise things were pretty good - comfy bed (albeit one of those zipped together twins with two single duvets), decent lighting and the fridge was stocked up daily with free cola, smoothies and water. The shower wasn't bad (when they say rain shower all they mean is a fixed rose, as the pressure's not up to much), toiletries were okay (no brands that I have ever heard of) and the TV had lots of channels.There was a problem with mosquitoes, but I assume this is due to the recent hot wet weather and the closeness to the canal. There was a mosquito repeller plugged in in the room but it wasn't terribly effective (I got pretty good at swatting the blighters).The breakfast was the highlight of the hotel. Fresh bread for toasting, a selection of jams and spreads plus cheese, ham and warmed croissants. On top of this, freshly squeezed orange juice, good hot coffee and eggs (however you like them) and bacon. Lots of guides and style magazines dotted about, plus brochures and maps of the area.Rachel (one of the proprietors) was really welcoming and friendly and happy to chat when we came in and out (and she does mean scrambled eggs).Pepijn just didn鈥檛 seem to be that warm. He may have been having a bad week, but he just wasn鈥檛 in to making conversation and I suspect is happier behind the scenes than out front dealing with people. What else can I say? Overall it wasn't bad for the money but it is about time they had a revamp to get back to the standard that they show on their website and that lives up to the reputation they have built up here on Tripadvisor and that got them included in some of the hip hotel guides.

<Content>Excellent hosts ! We spent 3 days in this hotel with some friends. We were 8 in total so we almost used all the rooms. If you want to stay at luxury hotel with all the commodities this is not for you. However, if you want to really feel like at home, then this hotel is the one you're looking for. Rachel a Pepjin are excellent hosts, they recommended some restaurants and made the reservation for us and their extreme sympathy was the best thing. The breakfast was excellent and the rooms were clean, comfortable and nice. The only negative point is the mess in the reception and that the bar was not working. But, depending how you see it, it would be also part of his charm!

<Content>Wonderful Experience My wife and I recently returned from a 2 week honeymoon to Europe. We started off our trip at the Hotel Misc in Amsterdam, and from the day we left the hotel we missed it. We stayed in the Baroque room. This hotel thinks about every comfort element, from comfortable bets, bathrobes and great waterfall shower. Every morning you are welcomed with a world class breakfest, fresh bread, fresh squeezed orange juice, home made jam and coffee that would make starbucks jealous. I could probably write about the breakfest alone for 10 minutes. Long story short, this is a wonderfull hotel, in a great location with even better hosts. If you are searching for the perfect hotel, you found it. Papiejn and Rachel, we cant waite to stay at your hotel in the future. thanks again!!Brandon and Erin

<Content>Ideal place to stay We recently spent 5 nights at Hotel Misc and cannot wait to return! Rachel and Pepjin are wonderful - so helpful, kind and laid back. Not only did they give us great recommendations for places to go hear music or eat, but they were even kind enough to let us borrow a spare cell phone!The hotel itself is exactly what we were looking for - fantastic location; spacious (by European standards), clean rooms and bathrooms; great breakfast; and reasonably priced. We stayed in the Retro room and loved having the quite garden view.We were so pleased with our stay and would not even think of staying elsewhere for our next visit. Laura  Ford

<Content>Love this hotel! I have just returned from Amsterdam 8th May 07, we stayed at this lovely hotel. We arrived late on Friday evening, after getting a taxi from the airport (if you plan to do this book your taxi through the hotel to save approx 15 euro). All rooms have themes, we stayed in the Rembrandt room which was lovely, very comfortable and clean, with a lovely view of the canal. We found the breakfast superb, choice of breads, croissants, cheese, egg and bacon and fantastic coffee...all very filling and good value. (Rachael's home made jams are also a nice touch)I would recommend this hotel to anyone, it is in a lovely area, great access to shops and local bars only thing wich may pose a problem for somepeople is the stairs, which are very steep and narrow, but we didn't find this a problem.Would stay at this hotel whenever I return to Amsterdam!!

<Content>Cosy And Enchantful Went there for our anniversary which, incidentally, is on St Patrick's Day.I had asked Rachel and Pepijn to prepare the room with a little fancy St Pat's decoration, which they did (check photos) very kindly.Both Rachel and Pepijn were very helpful during our stay. We had nice little chats in the morning with our excellent and plentiful breakfast as we were in no hurry.They answered all our questions about the city, what to see, when to see it, where to buy that excellent cheese we had for breakfast...The smaller rooms (garden view) are a good size, and the larger ones (canal view) are huge, especially if you think about the size of everything else in Amsterdam.We definitely loved our stay there and will most surely return when we go back to Amsterdam.THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

<Content>Little Gem We've just returned from the Hotel Misc and we had a wonderful time. The hotel offers everything that a larger one could not. The personal service was brilliant. Rachel recommended restaurants that we otherwise would not have found and also made reservations for us.The bar is really well stocked and Rachel has a really good bartending knowledge. After asking for a gin and tonic, Rachel offered me a cocktail made with the local genever, which was so good I bought a bottle to take home. Similarly she recommended local beers to my ale drinking other half!We stayed in the baroque room and although it was one of the smaller rooms, there was plenty of space. The room had a complimentary snack bar filled with juices, fizzy drinks and snacks. The location was great - just off Nieumarket providing a fabulous base to explore the city on foot. The hotel has lots of books on exploring and eating and drinking in Amsterdam which came in handy. There are also umbrellas which you can use which were a life saver when it tipped it down!The bar and breakfast area has a very Ikea like feel. It's trendy but, unlike some places, it still feels friendly and cosy.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Hotel Misc to friends and family.

<Content>Best of both worlds Quite like Amsterdam itself gathering the advantages of a international city in a village atmosphere, Hotel Misc succesfully offers the best of both worlds. The cosiness, friendship, true  personalised care of the hosts that one may expect from a BB and the top quality of accomodation  food, Wi-fi, telephone, TV, safe, minibar, 24/24 access by magnetic key, information  bookings and overall professional service that you may look for in international hotels. Hotel Misc is thus small by its size (only 6 rooms) but big by its ambition: ie. making sure you spend a perfect stay in Amsterdam and take home fantastic memories. Many Amsterdammers find their city beautiful (and rightly so!) but not all of them do so much to share this love with their guests as Pepijn  Rachel (the owners of Hotel Misc) do. The other reviews have said it all about the great location, canal view, peaceful rooms, etc, which I certainly confirm. There is only one risk with Hotel Misc and that is that you might not be able to find a room available, given its increasing (and derserved) popularity!

<Content>Comfortable stay Stayed here over Christmas 2005 and had a very pleasant time. Hotel is located in a well catered for area including quality restaurants, close but not too close to RL district, walkable to Van Gogh, Heineken Mus. and Concert hall. Also worth noting, is that the New' Sq looks great at this time of year!Very small premises (with scary staircase to the top...) with a contemporary but very comfortable feel. Our room was of a reasonable standard and good size but on the rear of building. Try to get one on the front of building if you can. Best of all, the owner couldn't be more welcoming or happy to help. Great breakfast. Well recommended.

<Author>TwoTorontoTravellers
<Content>A Wonderful, romantic stay in Amsterdam My boyfriend and I stayed in the Baroque room in October. We can't say enough positive words about Hotel Misc. The room was very romantic. At night, we would turn out the lights, except for the chandelier above the bed (the light bulbs looked like flames when on), and would sit in the big windows that overlook a garden and listen to the city. You can hear church bells every 15 minutes from the room. The room is quiet (on the top floor but worth the climb) and very clean. Pepijn and Rachel were amazingly helpful and welcoming people. All of their suggestions for restaurants, etc were exceptional. Have them book a boat tour for you if you have the time. It's such a calm, relaxing way to see the city. The location was very convenient, central and safe. You are so close to everything - a couple of steps and you're in the Red Light District.  I wanted a hotel that was clean, inviting and had a bit of character. The hotel was so much more. Unlike most hotels we have stayed in, this one felt like home for a few days. We were sad to leave. We can't think of Amsterdam now without mentioning Hotel Misc. There's no place I would stay except Hotel Misc when we return.We can't wait to visit again!

<Content>Thanks Pepijn and Rachel (and the cat!) We stayed at the Misc in September, in the Wonders room which is pretty and looks out onto a peaceful garden, with the beautiful sounds of church bells. We liked so many things about this place. Cute room, excellent location, yummy breakfast, all the ameneties we needed, and wonderful hosts, including the cozy tortoiseshell cat. Pepijn was great, very laid back but at the same time attentive and helpful. Our experience here was perfect and we definitely recommend it!

<Content>Plenty of Personality and great location I stood 3 nights at Hotel Misc 9/19-9/22/06. The hotel is more of a bed and breakfast with 24 hour service. Pepijn our host was extremely helpful. He would give us restaurant recommendations, club recommendations and draw out routes for us on our map. The attentive service alone is why I rate the hotel so high.THe hotel is in a great location right off o Nieumarket Square and a block or two to China Town and the Red Light District. The hotel itself reminded me of a Hippie hangout and above all else you felt very welcome. The room was large for European Standards (I had the design room). The room was in the front so you could hear some street noise. The room and amenities itself were minimal. I would not recommend anyone to stay here who could not easily make it up the narrow winding stairs native to Amsterdam.Breakfast was fresh breads, cheese, 1 egg and freshly squeezed orange juice with great coffee. It definitely wasn't a luxury hotel but the experience was well worth it and I would definitely stay again.Thanks to Rachel  Pepijn

<Content>Great hotel, great people, great location Have just returned from four nights at the Hotel Misc (16-19Sept). Other reviewers have given very good reports on this canal-side hotel which is the reason we went there. We were not dissapointed. The two people running the hotel, Rachel and Pepijn could not do enough - we borrowed an umbrella, borrowed books, borrowed a pass for the botanical gardens, took their advice on what to see and where to go, had no charge made for a five minute phone call to the UK.We stayed in the Rembrant room at the front of the hotel and we overlooked the canal. This really is old Amsterdam. Comfortable room with plenty of Rembrant pictures, clean, usual facilities including two comfortable chairs in the window. The stairs however are very steep and winding and would not suit a disabled person. Good breakfast of cheese, friut, jams and super fresh bread. Because of the very good location we did not use public transport. The central station, Dam Square, flower market, canal cruises, main shops, botanical gardens and as many canals and bridges as you could ever want are all within 15 minutes walk. The red light area is even closer but poses no problem.Plenty of bars, cafes and restaurants close by. A real traditional Dutch narrow house that you see in the paintings and not to be missed. Not just for younger people, my wife and I are 60 and 63.

<Content>Wedding night Last week we had our weddingnight in the hotel Miscc, and it turned out to be an excellent and very nice stay, in the first place thanks to the lovely owners who are friendly and helpfull -something that is very rare to find in Amsterdam. The room we got was named 'wonders', and that is exactly what it was -everyone who wants a romatnic night in this hotel should book that room. In the morning, in fact it was already noon, we got a very healthy breakfast who helped us to get rid of a hang-over.Herman and Els

<Content>Booking disaster Appalling booking system. Hotel Misc accepted our booking and credit card details via their website when actually fully booked, then let us know only weeks later, after the rest of our trip was completely organised, and it was too late to book anywhere else good. The hotel itself may be fine but we will never know. Do not trust their booking system.
