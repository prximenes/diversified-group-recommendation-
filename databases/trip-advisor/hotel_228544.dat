<Content>Very Satisfied with the Stay We were a group of 3 that booked 2 rooms at the hotel for a 3 night stay. Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay. The location is acceptable, we felt safe and the hotel was not too far from the main attractions. For avid walkers such as me and my wife, walking everywhere was quite pleasant--we walked to all of the main attractons which also gave us the opportunity to explore the local residential areas. The train station for both TMB and Renfe (for to/from Airport) are within less than 5 minutes walk (Station El Clot). It takes approximately 1 hour to reach the airport at a cost of 2.60 Euros. As far as the rooms, the staff and breakfast, all was above average. Upon check-in, the receptionist was very nice and pleasant, spoke English (slightly worrisome because none in our party speaks Spanish) and even gave us vouchers for a free Cava at the bar. The room was large enough by European standards, easy to get to both by elevator and stairs (which were actually well-lit as it faced the front and had glass panes). Most important of all, the room was clean. The breakfast was just fine with enough choices. The price was included in our stay which made it all the better. The cheese/marmalade sandwiches, tuna sandwiches (yes for breakfast!) and sardine sandwiches were excellent. There was also a hot griddle for eggs which we did not try. We never felt unsafe in the area of the hotel as walked back each night typically after 11:30 PM.  Overall, I would rate the stay above average for the price we paid and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>pretty good The hotel is about 4 minutes walk from clot metro. It takes about 20 mins from the hotel (by metro) to get to the main attractions apart from sagrada familia which can be walked in 15 mins. The room was large and clean, as was the bathroom. (6th floor) The area seemed ok,if a bit run down. The toilet did not flush properly which the hotel sorted out quickly. The staff are efficient, if not overly friendly. eg i am not sure if the one of the female receptionists had the ability to smile. however, a couple of the staff were friendly and all were helpful. breakfast was quite nice with a selection of pastries and cereals and coffee, and some hot options. (no bacon) The hotel is clean, and there were no noise issues, although perhaps this was due to the time of year. there appears to only ever be one person on reception which is a bit of a problem with a hotel this size. clot metro is on red line 1 and purple line 2 which allows for easy access to the things to see. when arriving, leave the station from the red line at exit sortida arago. the hotel also provides dinner which we did not have.

<Content>Never seen something like it The hotel advertises a 3 star rating, but it should be a 1 star. First the location is bad and far away from city attractions, only Sagrada Familia is near. The elevators are a disaster and you cannot get to your room if you do not take the right one. Hallways are dark as are the stairs. You have to be a circus acrobat to get acrossthe room without tripping with the bed,suitcases, given the narrow and angular design of the room. The bathroom was huge, but the toilet paper dispenser was located at the opposite wall from the toilet, so that was a problem if one did not take the paper beforehand. The front desk personal is unhelpful,with a take or leave it attitude, and the same applies to the restaurant . The price for the safe was insane. I will never recommend this place to anybody

<Content>Good Hotel I spent in this hotel 3 nights.- Hotel : nice hotel, clean and quiet rooms + location -Breakfast: was not included, it costs ca 12 Euros but nearby there is a backer and cafeterias which are very cheap( coffe+ croissant from Eur. 1.40 to Eur 2,00) - Location: walking distance to the sagrada familia ( 10 minutes) - while one hour walking to Passage de Gracia  but there are 2 metro lines ( the red and the violet one) which lead in 10 minutes to the city centre. - The metro is 2/3 minutes far from the hotel. -From the airport you can take the local train RENFE directly to passage de Gracia and change to the violet metro. ( total cost Eur. 2,60) I suggest to take the T 10 ticket, for 7.20 Eur for 10 Metro + bus tickets. ( onle single ticket costs Eur. 1,30) Yuo can use it for the RENFE train too.

<Content>Quite a surprise It was quite a surprise. The Hotel was Nice, Breakfast was excellent. Our room was very quiet and clean with almost no noise from the outside which was a surprise from everything I read about this hotel, but we did run into Problems. Our room Central Air conditioner did not work, which was very inconvient as it was +34 C outside, Hotel was full so we couldn't change rooms and the Front Desk forgot to book our ride back to the Airport that we requested the night before which made us navigate the Metro and Bus system at 5:30 a.m. They did not seem interested in helping us and made it sound like it was my fault for not booking the night before.

<Content>What A Pleasant Surprise! At the end of our 12-day jaunt through London, France and Barcelona, our group stayed two nights at the Catalonia Aragon. What a wonderful surprise. It's about 6-8 blocks east of the marvelous Sagrada Familia cathedral, near the Clot metro stop. The neighborhood is working-class, but we didn't feel unsafe walking to the cathedral in the evening. The rooms were spacious (by European standards), and it was evident that they had been recently redone. The breakfast/restaurant was excellent -- we had a great buffet supper, and breakfast the next morning had cook-to-order omelettes available, along with steamed tomatoes, cheeses, meats, cereals, etc! The staff was most helpful, and spoke very passable English, offering to briefly stow our luggage while we ate breakfast before heading to the Estancia Franca train station to catch our train to Lyon (we had stayed behind, the rest of the group had left at 3 am to catch their flight). The also were most helpful in getting a taxi for us to the train station. I'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised! We stayed at the Catalona Aragon for 3 nights and were pleasantly surprised with the experience at the hotel. It was a lovely stay. Having read numerous reviews, we were a bit reluctant, but it worked out. Customer Service: It was impeccable - the front desk staff were as helpful as possible, some more than others, but always to the best of their ability. They checked tickets for concerts, bullfights, and looked into dinner reservations.Location: Some reviews noted that the hotel was far away - it depends on what you are looking to do and where you are planning to go - we found the hotel very accessible. It is a 2 minute walk to Clot metro station, which is on the L2 and very well connected without needing multiple transfers. That said, given the nice weather, we took a few nice walks to La Sagrada Familia and even all the way to Las Ramblas and did not find it too much trouble - it was a great location. We were able to see a few less touristy spots and eat a few more authentic meals than if we'd stayed directly in the city center. We stayed for 4 full days and did not use up our T-10 metro cards!Despite the fact that everyone raved about the breakfast - we did not eat it, instead, we opted for amazing .65 croissants at the bakery just 1 block past the hotel (away from the metro) - amazing, fresh, and much better than the 12 euro option at the hotel! Also, 'Isabels' is a local convenient store - .77 for a 1.5L bottle of water - if you are walking into town, better to buy it there, because at La Sagrada Familiar the same bottle was 2.50 euros.Booking: We booked on laterooms.com where the rate was substantially lower than the website and expedia. Then, I emailed the reservation staff at the Aragon, who emailed back promptly and worked with me to ensure that the room had 2 beds pushed together so that my boyfriend and I did not have to sleep across the room - very very helpful. Then, reservations surprised me by sending an envelope of 'Barcelona' information - tours, exhibits, etc to my apartment, which arrived before we left so that we could start to plan out our trip.We hope this helps! We would definitely return to the hotel - clean, modern, and very refreshing!

<Content>nice comfy hotel in quiet neighbourhood We stayed just for one night. The hotel is clean, modern and has a nice atmosphere. The shower in our room was big enough to have a party in and the although we didnt try the breakfast it looked very nice. It was an easy walk to get to the metro and then onwards to rest of the city.

<Content>Another great stay in Barcelona We were transferred from the adjacent Hotel Albeniz, and we probably received better value at this hotel. The bedroom smelt a little smoky, and was fairly small, but it was clean and comfortable, with a modern bathroom, with both bath and shower. There was plenty of choice at the breakfast buffet, with omelettes available, cooked to order, as well as the usual selection of food. We did receive an unnecessarily surly reception when we arrived before 7.30.a.m. on Saturday; breakfast is served half-an-hour later at weekends.The hotel is a very short walk from the Clot Metro station, and we saved a lot of time and money by purchasing five-day travel tickets (which permit access to bus and metro.)This was our third visit to Barcelona, and it gets better each time, with so much to see, and such beautiful colours. This time we included a tour of the fantastic Palau Musica de Catalunya, and also participated in an excusion to Montserrat, Sitges and a winery, as well as visiting the normal Gaudi haunts. Hotel Aragon was fine for our purpose. Our only complaint about the holiday was having to fly home at the end !!!!

<Content>Under the average hotel I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and 2005 but I didn't like the hotel.It was under renovation but we were put in the oldest part of the hotel, for sure. The room was nothing special (the worst I've been), small, old and the heater has been grabbed from the wall and there was dust in. The bathroom was much better and clean. Our friends had to change their room because the 1st one had a really strange smell and was dirty.The staff was really bad, un-helpful and, at breakfast, they were always looking at us as if we were going to steal food or something. They didn't offer to help with the luggage and gave us rooms located somewhere strange with no indications and, when we asked for help to find the rooms they were unpleasant.The breakfast was really good and with a wide choice and the comedor was new and with very good conditions.The hotel is far away from the heart of Barcelona, at night that zone is quite scary, all the shops are closed and with metal doors, so it is not very pleasant to walk there at night. The nearest Metro station os Clot, 5-10 minutes walking. The metro station was dirty and had no one at night.I think now the hotel is renovated but if I return to Barcelona I would not choose Catalonia Aragon!

<Content>Nice Hotel with great location. I stayed in this hotel for almost a week during my honeymoon vacation. A three stars ranking hotel (after a full renovation recently) located in a quiet area, walking distance from the famous Sagrada Familia and from a metro station, which we later on used to go easily everywhereIf you are intrested in more details please see:[--]

<Content>Lovely city Booked this hotel through Fly Globespan.Hotel is a bit far from the heart of the city, although the Clot Metro station is about 5 mins walk away, this metro line takes you to all the hussle and bussle in the heart of Barcelona.The room itself was a fairy average size, the beds were twin beds pushed together, The bathroom was a bit dated but served it's purpose well. The room walls are fairly thin and you can hear people walking above you on the wood floor. Outside the room it can be fairly busy first thing in the morning and the lift beeps everytime it opens.The buffet breakfast was very good and there was lots of choice.On the whole the staff were friendly and helpful enough.If I was to go toBarcelona again I would stay somewhere closer tto the centre itself.

<Content>Great hotel - well worth the money I stayed here with my girlfriend recently and thought the hotel was great. We paid 拢77.50 per night altogether which included a large buffet breakfast every day which was very impressive. There was everything you can think of, both hot (omlettes, bacon, sausages in particular) and cold (croissants, many pastries etc) and coffees, espressos etc. This was easily the best choice of breakfast I've seen yet and much better than the 4 and 5 star hotels I've been to have to offer.The bedroom itself was alright, nice decor and a decent size. The bathroom was good, especially the large shower wet room which had a powerful shower. We stayed on the 4th floor so had to use the lift and there was no problems with the lift.The location was also quite good, a couple of minutes walk from Clot metro station which takes you to places such as Sagrada Familia, Nou Camp and Placa Catalunya within minutes. I would say the area is alright and fairly safe but always be aware of those around you just like in any other major European city and use your common sense and you'll be fine. The metro in the city is excellent...you can get to the beach fairly easily also.The hotel can get fairly noisy at times mainly because the floor is marbled for instance when people are coming in at night but don't let you put this off staying there as every other hotel I've ever stayed in have been the same. The walls are quite thin also but I think this is just common in hotels...we hardly stayed in the hotel so it really wasn't a problem for us so don't let it put you off, the positives easily outweigh the negatives.I would highly recommend this place especially for couples, friends and families.

<Content>Terrible elevator... The room was fine as well as the location of the hotel (not too far from city centre). However, there were 2 big problems disappointing me: noise on the outside and a constant beeping from the elevator door throughout the night whenever the door opened. Overall, i didn't get much sleep because of this so i'm disappointed with the hotel.

<Content>I will not be back... passed three nights in the Catalonia Aragon with my wife in the beggining of June. I sent an email for the hotel asking prices but not receive any answer.A day before leavong, I call directly to the hotel and receive the price of the stay. As soon as I arrive to the Hotel, I was informed that the value that me envoys by email (still expecting the answer..) was lower then the one gave by phone. The price was 93 鈧?by night. In the check out the price was the double and if it wasn麓t the fact that I had written the correct price I would have to pay the double. The hotel in itself is nothing of special. Of early morning, we were awake with beaten fortresses in the doors in other levels and people walking in the correddors and there were many teenagers that at night did a lot noise. The elevators did not function correctly and the doorman that was on the door did not know to give any usefull information to you . The breakfast was the more razoavel of our stay. The hotel is not properly well located for who is going to be nearby the center. In the exit I asked the price of a taxi for the airport and informed myself that was more or less 40 鈧?and called a taxi. I opted for go in a taxi that passed in the street and led myself only 20 鈧? The persons of the staff are unpleasant and do not have a lot will in collaborate with . Finally, it is a hotel for which I am not going to come back.

<Content>good value This hotel is lovely and would definately go back for a return visit. It is situated in a residential part of Barcelona but is easy access to a metro station. The room was very clean and a decent size and breakfasts were really nice. Our airline did not book a room for us as they were requested to do but the receptionist called the airline after letting us check in and sorted it all out. Barcelona itself is great - I have never been but will definately be going back in the not to distant future. The transport system is extremely cheap and reliable . We would recommend getting the train into the centre of barcelona from the airport and 拢1 for 2 people it is wll worth it. Buy the T10 ticket at the station at the airport and thats all it will cost you to get to your hotel as you dont get charged again for inter changing at the metro. If your looking for a nice relaxing break then this is the hotel and city for you

<Content>Happy to return! booked this hotel as part of a budget deal online so didnt have the highest expectations. We were pleasantly surprised! The staff were nice, despite us having a couple of late nights and having to wake the porters up to get into the hotel.The location isn't too bad at all. With a taxi ride to the airport only 25euros and a barcelona card (9euros for 2days) getting about the city is pretty easy. As long as you familiarise yourself with the tube system, managing to get from one end of barcelona to the other is simple. The Sagrada Familia is a couple of stops away and HAS to be visited- its so close!The rooms were nice, clean and the bathrooms are amazing. The bath is big enough for two and the shower is excellent! Breakfast was pretty good, although we didn't make it on our first day. We'd both be happy to return to the hotel!

<Content>Enjoyable stay My boyfriend and I have just returned from a short stay in this hotel. We found it to be very clean and we really enjoyed our time there. The breakfast was excellent. We ate in the hotel one night, the meal was lovely but the menu was a bit limited and the menu stayed the same for each night of our stay. We stayed in a room on the seventh floor which was very quiet and thankfully there was air conditioning and a lift. There is bar which remains open until 12 but it was very quiet. There are also 2 computer that I saw available for use. You insert 鈧? into the machine and you get 10 minutes internet time. This was very handy in order to check up flight times etc. The staff did not speak much english but were very good for organising taxi's to take us where we wanted to go. It is a good walk to the city centre, we did walk once but it is quite a distance in the heat so it was much easier to flag down a taxi. There wasn't alot to do in the immediate area but it was only a short walk from the Sagrada Famillia. Overall, our stay was very enjoyable and I would definately recommend it to people for a short break.

<Content>Don't recommend this hotel The room I stayed at smelled like mold, men麓s cologne, and new paint and it didn麓t have any ventilation or windows to help air it out. The hotel is situated outside of the main areas of Barcelona (you can麓t find it on the Street Wise map) so it麓s about a 40 minute walk to Old Town or you have use the metro. The hotel staff was rude and not helpful at all.I would recommend the Hotel Aristol (which is also a little outside of the main city area but much cleaner) or the Fiesta Hotel Caspe (which was really nice and close to the Arc). Hope this helps.

<Content>not a bad hotel for the price This hotel was adequate for our travel needs. The rooms were clean and the breakfast was good. The hotel staff was not always helpful and the location isn't the greatest because it's kinda far from all the major sights. So although you may save money, you may end up paying more for public transportation. There is a good restaurant right down the street from it owned by a husband and wife. She cooks meals to order and they are very helpful and have lots of tips for tourist. I would stay here again.

<Content>No frills Barcelona Stay This hotel is in a good location - easy access to a metro stop where two metro lines intersect - very convienant for touring! The room is small but adequate. The mattress was as hard as a rock, but if you don't mind a fim mattress, then you won't have any complaints. The hotel is modern and clean and has a nice breakfast buffet. But you better come prepared - the staff is of little help, whether you need a restaurant recommendation, directions to the train station or simply a wake up call, the staff can't be bothered. We had prepaid our stay and the desk clerk was insistant that we still owed for the room - thankfully we brought the email paperwork and conformation info... be sure that you have proof if you prepay! The hotel doesn't offer any extras, and for the price, it seemed to underdeliver. But if you are looking for a clean place to stay and you plan to be out touring, not inside the hotel with the less than friendly staff, this hotel will work for you.

<Content>Perfect for our needs My husband and I and two of our friends had booked the Catalonia Aragon because of past favorable reviews. We were very pleased that we did as it offered us great accomodations, close to the metro, lots of little shops and restaurants nearby and a great breakfast that would begin our day on a good note. The rooms were very clean, the water was hot and the shower had lots of pressure. The bathrooms were stocked everyday with essentials. Most of the rooms seem to face the street and it was quite noisy, but we found that if we closed the windows it solved the problem. The day we arrived, after nearly 20 hours of travelling, we were very early and did not think we would get to check in right away, but we were pleasantly surprised when we were handed the keys.If we ever return to Barcelona, we would stay there again.L.

<Content>Nice hotel We stayed here for three nights this month. The breakfast was very good, good pineapple. The room was clean, the desk staff cordial. I did notice they don't greet you as you come and go by the desk. I thought that was rude, being trained in the hotel field. I also thought it would be helpful if the hotel had maps available of the neighborhood instead of just saying, go out of the hotel, turn right and walk 7 blocks to get to La Sagrada. I'm not sure I'd stay there again on my own, this hotel was included in our package.

<Content>Loved the Catalonia Aragon My husband, son, his girlfriend and myself have just returned from two super nights stay in this hotel.Imaculately clean,warm and bright rooms,comfy beds and beautiful well stocked bathrooms,piping hot water and powerful shower,just what you need when you come back from the football frozen to the bone.Excellent buffet breakfast, to satisfy even the biggest appetite. Helpfull and honest staff. After checking out we left our bags in the luggage room to collect later in the day as we had an evening flight home. About an hour later, after leaving the hotel, we realised we had left some English money in our room. When we returned the room had been cleaned and the money had been left in reception with our room number and our name on it to be given to us when we returned to collect our luggage. Ideally situated for the Metro,which will take you from one side of the city to the other for e1.20. Friendly local bars for snacks and reasonably priced drinks.We would deffinately stay here again.

<Content>Great Breakfast Stayed at the Catalonia Aragon for 3 nights last month (November 2005). Clean, stylish rooms.Front Desk was extremely helpful with our lost luggage problem. Not in center of town, but nearby metro and train to airport. And as others have stated- a great breakfast!

<Content>good hotel,shame about the bar! My Husband and i stayed in this hotel for my 50th birthday trip. We were there for 3nights and found it very convenient to metro station,2/3 mins.away. We found some nice,small and friendly local bars very nearby where one could easily get a snack of bocadillo or tortilla as well as something more than that if required.We walked from the hotel to Sagrada Familia quite easily on our first night.On Friday and Saturday,we got a metro within 10mins or so to Placa Catalunya and then hopped on the Bus Turistica for fantastic tours around the whole city.On Friday night,we returned on the metro to take in the ambiance of Las Ramblas,returning with no bother from the nearby metro station which took us back to our area in 3 stops.The room was spacious enough and well fitted out as was the bathroom with plenty of 'goodies'laid on.We had a meal in the restaurant on Saturday evening which was very disappointing after the meals we had had in other places in barcelona.The service was poor and the food adequate.The bar service was abysmal totally. When it was open and staffed,they did not know much about drinks!it was hard to get someone to serve us and this was not late by any means.It's nice to have a nightcap back at one's hotel before retiring,this it seems is not allowed in Hotel Catalonia Aragon!!Overall,I would recommend it but do your drinking and eating elsewhere!!

<Content>Great hotel Stayed in the Aragon for 3 nights at the beginning of November. We paid around 拢70 per night for a double room. Place very clean although the layout can be a bit confusing on arrival. Floors seem to be split so that you have to find out which lift to take up.But the best thing about the hotel is the breakfasts. From 7.30 to 10.30 - buffet style. Lots of choice and no limits on the amount you can eat. Excellent fare too.The hotel location is a little out from the centre but its only a hundred metres or so from Clot metro station with links to all parts of Barcelona. My partner found the crowds at Catalunya metro intimidating but hey its a big city!Full marks for economy, style and service.

<Content>Needs improvement Having stayed in the hotel for 4 nights.I found a couple of things that could be improved on.The hotel Service was very bad.Very unhelpful and a lot of english speaking tourists were staying there and most of the people working behind recption had very poor english.Rooms are very small and do stink of smoke as well.The Area itself is not too bad.But if you are heading back to your hotel after 1am get a Taxi home.

<Content>Worst hotel I've stayed at - ever I got back last night from staying at the Catalonia Aragon for four nights and decided to do my first post here. I'm young, I can speak Spanish and I went to Barcelona for a conference - but I was treated like a fool. First of all, the hotel is in a seedy area with basically no hotel security. When I checked in, the lady standing next to me had just been robbed - in the hotel!! And I heard of another two people to whom this had happened (the hotel staff was extremely unhelpful in each case). Only five rooms on the floor on which I stayed were occupied as there was major building work going on, with all the noise and dirt attached and plenty of builders hanging around your door. Room was small and stank of smoke but the worst thing was that there was no phone socket. When I first complained about the phone not being connected, the receptionist and bell-boy gave me weird looks (strange girl, doedn't know how to plug in a phone..). After complaining three times (my boss had sent me on a business trip and wanted to be able to get in touch with me, damn it), someone finally came and checked and confirmed that there was no socket. Every night when I got back from the conference I'd be told that it would be sorted out the next morning but nothing happened during my entire stay. Anyway, if you must stay there, keep an eye on your belongings both within the hotel and when walking to the metro or around the Clot area OR take a taxi at all times.

<Content>Great hotel, good location We stayed at this hotel in August 2005 and couldnt fault it. Location is superb - 3 min walk to Clot metro and rail stations. The rail station takes you directly to the airport in 25 mins for a mere 2 Euros a head! To the main La Rambla area takes about 15 mins. There is also a huge shopping centre called Diagonal Glories a 10 min walk from the hotel, near the Glories metro station and close to a large glass building which looks like the gherkin in London - for all shopping requirements as well as restaurants.The breakfast at the hotel was superb - a full range of hot and cold. The rooms were modern, clean and comfortable, and each room had aircon and a great high pressure shower. The hotel is in a quiet area which is good when you need to get some sleep at the end of a long day sightseeing. We would definately look at staying at this hotel again on future trips to Barcelona.

<Content>Smart, good breakfast and great location. This is a reasonably priced business hotel in 'Clot 'only 3 metro stops from Sagrada Familia and its easy and cheap to get to all the sites with a metro pass. Very trendy and tasteful, we got a big room with a TV, big wardrobe and a great bathroom. The hotel generally is spotless.Breakfast has plenty on offer , though you will have to get up early to get the bacon! The chef's are happy to cook you an egg or bacon how you like on request.The maid came round daily to clean and with fresh towels .The location is what I would call a local residetial area, quiet at night and plenty of little local shops if you need any urgent essentials.The metro less than 5 mins walk away. So if you're a couple or friends who want a very nice affordable place to stay away from the crowds of hen and stag parties in la Rambla, this is perfect.The metro runs till 2am sat and sun so no problems if you want a night out.Otherwise cabs are cheap, if you want a drop out/into the centre of town, so I wouldn't worry about getting to Clot.I read the bad reviews and these were obviously going on when the hotel was being renovated so I can only say, its great now.It certainly feels superior to a three star hotel!

<Content>Wait til they get it renovated I would wait until this hotel finishes its renovations before I went here. The neighborhood is rather seedy and I didn't feel safe having my students out at night in it. It has no public phone and the staff was very rude and unhelpful to our tour director. Meals were average at best.The hotel didn't even bother to clean up the dust from renovations so floor was slippery.

<Content>On Point What a great Hotel!. I went there with a couple of girlfriends to get a break and what a break we got! the hotel was clean, peaceful, and just what we needed. It does however, get very hot in the summer and though the hotel boasts of air-conditioning it doesnt work to the desired effect....Full Blast!. The hotel is ideal for tourists, students and those who want a weekend break from the hustle and bustle of London. Highly Recommended.

<Content>You get what you pay for Booked this as a last minute break and then I read that the hotel is being renovated. However, this did not bother us as the work was in another wing. We were on Room only so can't comment on the food, and can't say we missed our brekkie as, by the time we reached the city, we were then ready for a bite to eat.The room was rather small and basic but as soon as we requested more pillows (why do continental hotels only ever put one pillow on their beds?) The bathroom was fine and the toiletries supplied daily was a nice touch. While it stated the Metro (Clot) was only a couple of mins from the hotel, I think you would need to be pretty nifty to make it in that time! Clot is best described as Working Class, definitely not touristy!We found a lovely hotel near the harbour - PanyVino - and it was really lovely ,great food and ambience too. Last word though - BEWARE of DIPPERS!!! We were targeted by two very young girls on our last trip in Metro to go to the Airport. Their accomplice was on the platform and blocked our exit. In this time,the girl took my purse with my money but more importantly, my credit cards. A horrible end to what had been a smashing break. Apart from that, we loved Barcelona, it is brilliant for short breaks and we would return again. This time with our goods held closer than the Crown Jewels!

<Content>Building site Just back from Barcelona, what a beautiful city!!! but cannot say the same about the Aragon. We arrived at the hotel around 7.00pm our hearts fell when we saw the buliling site outside the hotel. At reception there were buckets and towel on floor to catch water from a leaking roof.Our room was new and very clean. We rang down for room service and the only thing available was salad sandwiches. We then tried the restaraunt the only thing available was a buffet of salad, cold sausages and cold fish this cost us 30 euro for two. Next morning at 7.00 am the building work commenced hammering and drilling, no need for an alarm clock. The hotel was too far out and after a long day sight-seeing the hotel offered poor choice of food and not even a lounge to enjoy a relaxing drink.

<Content>got back today Just returned from three nights at the Catalonia Aragon. Booked the trip as a present for my husband but was a bit worried after reading the reviews on the site. There was no need to I'm glad to say.We arrived about 11pm, the girl on reception was perfectly pleasant and polite the whole time- she even smiled more than once- contrary to the info on other reviews. The hotel is built around a corner and some of the rooms can be difficult to find. We couldn't find ours but just went back to reception to ask and someone came with us.The public areas of the hotel have seen a bit better days, but they are trying to tidy them up a bit. There was notice in reception to this effect and one of the walls was painted while we were there. Some of the public areas are also being used as store rooms for mattresses and towels. I didn't mention it to any of the staff so don't know whether this is usual or not.The rooms themselves are fine, ours wasn't huge but there was plenty of room for two of us, everything was clean and tidy, the bed was comfy, loads of hot water, the heating control worked and the maid gave us clean towels and new toiletries every day. Breakfast was 7.30 to 10.30 every day and 7.30 til 11 am on Sunday. There was everything you could want to eat and more both hot  cold. The staff in the restaurant smiled too!Not much in the way of bars and restaurants right by the hotel but you pass plenty if you walk 2 streets back from the hotel toward Segrada Familia. For the price I paid I believe I got good value and would be happy to stay here again. The only drawback was the distance from the ramblas, place catalunya etc. We tended to have breakfast and leave for the day and just came back after our evening meal about 11pm. Had we been staying a bit more central we may have gone back to the hotel late afternoon for a bit of a rest. But instead we had to find a bar with some tasty tapas and a smooth red wine.... such hardship!

<Content>OK but would not go back The hotel is not in the center of Barcelona but the Clot metro and train station is within a 3 minutes walk. This makes travel to the airport, city center and nearby towns and resorts quick. You can also get to the hotel from Ramblas for about 6 euro (with day tarrif).Surroundings of the hotel were a bit suspicious as the streets were not well lit and were empty after midnight although we did not have any problems.Room was very small and simple with shabby furniture which reminded me Soviet hotels (defintely not the best memories I wanted to have). Breakfast was good with fresh pastry which is baked in the hotel. Staff was OK but not too firendly. Overall, the hotel did not spoil our enjoyment with Barcelona but I would not go back.

<Content>Okay, will not use again Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights (late August 2004).Found the staff hard work and not very helpful.The rooms are small but clean and comfortable.MAKE SURE you get your breakfast early as we were refused breakfast 20 minutes before it was supposed to close.TIP: Take a map out with you, as some taxi drivers could not find the place, then drop you off in the wrong area. Maps are available in reception.A bit out of the way but the location is close to the metro 'Clot'.

<Content>Great hotel....pity about the staff!!! Stayed here for 6 nights in July/Aug2004.DO NOT GO IN JULY/AUG as it is TOO HOT!!!!Hotel was a train journey away to nearest metro(Clot) and then about 5 minutes walk on the main Aragon Road.Hotel is Lovely! We were however on the very top floor.Good views of the surrounding area but if you have kids could be a problem ESPECIALLY if the lifts don't work...we were lucky!The room was very nice and clean and spacious and even the Breakfast was very good.However the staff are VERY HARD WORK!!!Not friendly(or perhaps they just didn't like US!!!).Apart from that,a good base to commute from to travel around Barca(which is GREAT!!!)

<Content>Avoid in the summer I stayed for one night with my family in late July after reading favourable reviews on this site. My advice would be to avoid this hotel in summer. The room was tiny for two people let alone for the three of us. Although basically clean the walls were desperately in need of being repainted, the air conditioning was ineffective and horrendously noisy so that we hardly slept at all. Window wouldn't open as the handle was broken (along with most of the air conditioning controls) but the loud traffic noise at the front would have made an open window probably too noisy. Reasonable breakfast, convenient luggage storage and closesnees to Clot station did not make up for the lack of sleep.

<Content>WOuld not go back We booked a weekend trip to Barcelona. The hotel was included in the package. Although being outside the centre it has good connections to public transportation. Next to that the breakfast was good.The service however was really bad. At check-in, they checked somebody else in under our name. Noticing they made an error the receptionist started cursing in Spanish thinking we didn't understand it. That already gave it a bad impression. The next day we noticed the air conditioning was not working so we told the same receptionist and asked her to have someone check it. When we came back the room was like a sauna (mid August).She argued with us and try to put is in a single bed room, at the same time other people seemed to have the same problem. In the end got no help from the hotel and found ourselves fixing the air-conditioning by de-icing. My advise don't go in in summer or ever...

<Content>Good tourist class hotel The best thing about the Aragon is its proximity to the meto (across the street). It really was convenient. My room was unique. You had to walk down a hallway before reaching the bedroom. It was a little worn but the beds were comfortable and the linens were clean. I knew beforehand that it was tourist class. It was bright and a nice breeze came in thru the windows esp. the bathroom window. The bath was average-size and I had plenty of towels. Breakfast was decent and included in the price of the room. I was surprised to see they had beer (Amstel) vending machines. They also have a small bar. There's an internet cafe on the corner, a Pizza Hut, and a few souvenir shops. The staff was friendly and stored our luggage for our evening departure. I'd stay there again.

<Content>Sightseeing in Barcelona We thought this hotel was excellent value for money - clean and comfortable with everything we needed. The breakfast was good, and who wants to eat evening meals in the hotel anyway? The Metro station was a couple of minutes walk away, and the Sagradia Familia only 10 minutes walk. A good place for sightseeing, (try the tourist bus) though you would need to get the Metro for shopping.

<Content>Comfortable and enjoyable stay We stayed at the Catalonia Aragon in February of 2002. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The Clot station is a very short walk away, which will take you into the main part of Barcelona pretty quickly. Our room and bathroom were clean and modern. We had a nice view from our room, as well. The breakfast buffet in the morning had a lot of variety and was filling, definitely better than your typical continental breakfast. It was a great place to stay, especially for the price!

<Content>Good value for money I stayed here for a couple of nights on business and my colleagues stayed a little longer on business. I thought the hotel was very good value for both it's location and it's room/breakfast. It is a 5 minute walk from Clot metro and mainline station which runs direct to and from the airport. The rooms were small and reasonably clean. One of my colleagues said that she was bothered by a lot of noise from the street so maybe the windows could be better as it is on a very busy street. Overall the hotel was starting to look a little tired and certainly within two years will need a re-vamp. However, the breakfast, which was included in the price I'd booked, was excellent. Large choice and have as much of it as you want. Staff were pleasant and the main guy was exceptionally helpful.With a similar budget to spend I would use the Hotel Aragon again.

<Content>Finding Clot railway station This was excellent, especially when we discoverd that Clot (2 mins walk from the Aragon) not only has a metro station but also a mainline railway station with cheap trips to Sitges, Girona etc. and also the airport (25 mins.). The railway station, being underground, was not that obvious and we only discovered it on day three. The breakfast was indeed excellent and plentiful and after a decent morning fill, only tapas, drinks and nuts were required for the rest of the day.

<Content>Good hotel, friendly staff. The hotel is very nice and the staff very friendly and helpful - all of them speak good english. We stayed there from 21-24 March 2004 and really enjoyed it. Everyone has talked about the breakfast, and it is very good, but do try the evening menu as well. We had an excellent 3 course evening meal with a bottle of good wine included for about 13 euros each - great value. The room was spotlessly clean and plenty big enough. The hotel is a bit out of town but the Metro is less than 5 minutes walk away (this Metro station also has a direct link to the airport) so you can be in the centre in about 10 minutes from leaving your hotel. I've read some of the less complimentary reviews on here, but from our own experience the hotel is very good and I would have no qualms about recommending the Aragon to anyone taking a holiday in Barcelona.

<Content>Don't Pay Any Attention To The Irish User Review The Irish user seems to have unrealistically expected much more for what they paid. The hotel is near a main shopping area, but not Las Ramblas! However, it's definitely worth exploring as an alternative from the parts that everyone visits. The hotel is extremely convenient for a metro station (linking you directly to the airport and La Place Catalunia without changing) and Gaudi's Cathedral (a pleasant walk; take time to look at the shops on the way if you can spare it). Across the road from the Cathedral you'll find an official tourist bus stop and somewhere to buy tickets. The hotel was fine; very friendly staff who were more than helpful in terms of explaining the stuff we really needed to know (i.e., what metro tickets to buy - that sort of thing). The room was pretty small but had a balcony about the same size. Some balcony furniture would have been nice but I suppose no hotel can guarantee that guests on the ninth floor won't indulge in gravity experiments... The bathroom was good, although being on the ninth floor we got no hot water pressure in the shower at the most popular time before breakfast (8-8:30ish). Any other time was fine. Breakfast was very good - enough to fill you up until past lunch time. Basically, if you don't have unrealistic expectations of what you'll get for your budget then you should be more than happy, especially as you're very close to public transport.

<Content>breakfast great,dinner variable Extremely clean, gorgeous breakfast, friendly and efficient English speaking staff. Very handy stroll to the Clot metro station which is at the junction of three lines and will take you anywhere you want to go for peanuts. A ten trip pass costs just 脗 6.00 ie about 40p for a trip no matter how far. Dinner was good on the Sunday, when Spanish locals came in to eat in family parties-it was quite nasty during the week when we chose to use the Metro to find restaurants downtown. We paid the 脗 4.00 per day to use a private safe and had no other problems. We flew from Barcelona airport, could have used the Metro to the hotel but being elderly took a taxi instead. It went straight there and cost about 脗 30.0

<Content>Pleasant hotel, cheap and cheerful Nice hotel, situated not too far out of barcelona itself. Nice buffet style breakfast. Clot Arago metro station around 300 yds from hotel which takes you to and from the main airport. Within walking distance of local restaurants. Beware of expensive telephone calls from your room, about 脗拢6.00 for a 30 second call to the UK. Staff were friendly and helpful and there is a facility to leave your luggage at the hotel on check out day. All in all a pleasant stay.
