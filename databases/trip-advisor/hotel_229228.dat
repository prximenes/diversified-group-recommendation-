<Content>Great hotel but lots of noise from the nearby disco! NH Caransa is a modern looking hotel with stylish interior and friendly service. We stayed there at a Saturday night which wasn't a good idea because we could hear the beats from the nearby club so hard that we even could recognize which songs they played. So unless you go partying yourself during the night, don't stay at this hotel at a Saturday or Friday evening.

<Content>The hotel was nice but the area was incredibly noisy We got to the hotel was told we could not use our debit card and had to leave a cah deposit of 50 euros which wasnt a problem, then when we came to book out (after a terrible night of riot police and noise) we were given back 57 euros, which we assumed was the room rate had gone down. We got back home the next day to a telephone call telling us they had made a mistake and they had given us 8 euros too much which was fair enough and agreed for them to use the debit card that was refused and couldn't be used in the hotel the day before they could now use. when we booked the hotel we booked it for 拢73 when we looked at our account they had taken 拢103. we will never use this chain of hotels again, we had booked on a non-refundable price so we can not understand how they can change the price now and 8 euros does not account for this discrepency.

<Content>Great Hotel for the 'Heavy Sleeper' Just a short weekend stay, turned up early and although the room wasn't ready they stored our luggage for us and when we returned had moved us down a couple of floors, not sure if it was an upgrade but it was a nice room, very clean. Comfortable beds with four choices of pillow, large bathroom. Staff were very polite and helpful. Would have scored excellent had it not been for the noise. Something I was aware of because of the proximity of nightclubs in Rembrant Square. Great location though in the heart of Amsterdam, within 10-20 minutes walking distance of virtually all attractions. So if you are a heavy sleeper or just out partying all night then this is the perfect place for you.

<Content>Nice Hotel, but noisy We have stayed at NH Hotels in the past and have never been disappointed. The NH Caransa was nice as well and they were offering a special to upgrade to a room that overlooked the square for 30 euro a night. Our room was very spacious with a king size bed (two twins together). We had no complaints about the hotel at all but per previous reviews, please be aware that it is very noisy in Rembrandtsplein. There are two clubs next door that close around 3AM and then folks are out and about in the streets until around 5AM. If you are a light sleeper as I am bring really good earplugs, otherwise you'll be up all night.

<Content>Beware of the fleas! I stayed at this hotel for a week and left having a positive opinion for the hotel and its stuff. It's true everybody was friendly, eager to help with every small or big problem that appeared always smiling. But when my 13 months daughter started bearing marks on her body, I couldn't believe that the diagnose would be: flea's bites, from the mattres or the carpet. If you can't be sure for your children's health in a 3 star hotel in one of the most popular cities in Europe today, where can you be? There is no excuse for that, as items that are destined to be used by babes should be sterlized.Shame on everybody responsible for that.

<Content>Good Hotel! It was a very well located hotel and the room was nice as well..We were debating between Park and NH. I am glad we chose NH. Though Park is located just opposite the train station, but the area was extremely noisy and unpleasant.

<Content>Nice Little Hotel After reading many great reviews from Trip Advisor, I decided to book the NH Caransa in Amsterdam. The hotel is clean, modern smallish hotel with about 66 rooms. The hotel staff were very friendly and very accomodating. After our long trip, we arrived a bit early and without any hesitation they allowed us to check into our room early to freshen up and relax. We asked the staff a few times to help us with various things and they were always very friendly and accomodating. Excellent service from this hotel.The room was very nice and modern. They looked just like the pictures. The hotel is situated right in the middle of Rembrantplein, the club area of Amsterdam. For the most part this did not bother us, as we live near the entertainment district back home. But one night the crowd was noisy until about 6am! We did not complain, but good to know for next time. Very central and easy walking distance to Leidsplein, Waterlooplein, Central Station and of course the red light district.For the price we paid the hotel was very nice. The hotel shuttle from the airport will drop you in front of the hote for about 13 Euros one way. The hotel is about 15-20 minutes walk from Central station, so I would not advise taking the train from the airport to the hotel if you have a lot of luggage.

<Content>Fantastic hotel in a great location This hotel is very modern and very clean - a must for any hotels i stay at. It is also in a great location with tram stop right outside the hotel. It is surrounded by restaurants which makes it really convenient if you are looking for places to eat. From the Central train station, just take tram 9 or 14 and get off at the Rembrandtplein stop. The hotel is just across the road from the tram stop. For those who prefer to walk, Dam Square is about a 15 min walk from the hotel - still quite accessible. The reception was very helpful, looking up information for us when requested. The only down side is that there seems to be a pub or night club next door, so at night time, you will have to put up with muffled music pounding through the walls. However, overall, the hotel is great and situated in a fantastic location.

<Content>excellent We, a group of eight, 4 couples are just back from two nights in this hotel. It was everything that it promised to be. It has a central location with a tram stop just out side the door; the staff was friendly and helpful. We didn鈥檛 opt for the breakfast as we felt it was expensive at 18 Euro a head, so we opted to make use of the tea and coffee facilities and get some fruit and fresh pastries at the local shop. The rooms were modern roomy and very clean and the bathroom was mod with extra nice toiletries. We chose this hotel as a work mate had stayed here and told me it was clean and an excellent location. So the price was ok once we knew it was good, at the end of the day you get what you pay for. We bought a 48 hour unlimited tram ticket which we used constantly. Most places are within walking distance. We got the hotel shuttle in from the airport and had pre arranged a price as there was 8 of us. Then the hotel arranged for the shuttle to pick us up on our return to the airport.

<Content>Good hotel! Good points: Very central - about 15 mins walk to Anne Frank's house, 10 mins to Van Gogh museum, flower market practically next door, tram stop outside the hotel. Very clean and comfortable (apparently the hotel had been recently renovated), choice of pillows, loads of great free toiletries, good breakfast. Staff very efficient, obliging and friendly. Bad points: Fairly noisy - right next door to a nightclub (bring earplugs if you cannot sleep unless it is deathly quiet). The small bottle of water in the room costs 鈧?.50. The windows cannot be opened and mine looked out onto a concrete wall with big metal pipes (but I suppose my room was quieter than those at the front of the hotel). The shower panel in the bathroom didn't stop the water going all over the floor.Tips: There is a shuttle bus which can pick you up from and drop you off at the airport (www.airporthotelshuttle.nl) - it's cheaper than a taxi. Szmulewicz restaurant around the corner at Bakkerstraat 12 is good (small and cosy). If you want to go to Anne Frank's house or the museums - get there early (before 10 am) otherwise the queue is very long.

<Content>A great value base! My Fiance and I just got back from 3 nights in the Caransa. Everything was great, nothing was 'wow' like a Jacuzzi bath or balcony over the canal, but the rooms were very nice and spacious, lovely bathrooms, spotlessly clean, great location- and when you paid the price we did I would have been very happy with a lot less! I booked the hotel with help from an online comparison site, we paid 拢185 for 3 nights including breakfast (and including Valentine's night) while without breakfast was 拢300! the company assured me this was right, and that this was a special rate the NH hotels sometimes put out (The Schiller and Doelen both had this same price).Breakfast was great, so much choice- fruits, breads cheeses, meats, salad, the usual eggs and bacon, loads of cakes, yogurts, carton drinks and convenient things you can sneak into your bag for later in the day! The toiletries and freebies were very generous, there was a pillow menu and a nice minibar. Ever staff member we met was very polite and friendly, and on arrival we were given a room with two beds pushed together as a double- we asked to see a double room and it was a lot smaller (just like the receptionist had advised us!) so we stuck with the twin.We really couldn't have wanted anything else from a hotel which is so central in Amsterdam- the trams stop literally on the doorstep and although you can hear them at night it's not bad, and it means it's never a hassle to pop back and forth during the day. I couldn't believe how much some pubs and restaurants charge for food (鈧?6 for a normal steak!) and booze (鈧?-6 a pint!) but there was a lovely restaurant round the back of the hotel called Szmulewicz which seemed popular with the locals. The guide book said how tacky the rembrandtplein was, ignore it- it just meant there was lots of choice for bars, shops, trams- ok it might be touristy but when you鈥檙e a tourist that can be convenient! I鈥檇 definitely go back again, and recommend it to anyone- save your money on the hotel, you鈥檒l need it for the restaurants!

<Content>Good value for money and a pleasant stay. I stayed for the weekend and found that the staff were polite and helpful, the rooms were clean and modern and well stocked with toiletries and anything you might have forgotten. I had a room at the back which was really quiet, despite the hotel's location on busy Rembrantsplein. The central location was useful during my short stay. I go to Amsterdam every couple of years and would definately stay at NH Caransa again.

<Content>Caransa is perfect for the money Attended IDFA 4 days in Amsterdam. Was booked by the conference staff, 480 euro total with breakfast included. The building looked weird from the outside, but I was pleasantly surprised once inside the room.Room had two beds, nice bedding, good lighting, good desk, nice extra armchair, sparkling bathroom. Drawback:: I'd hate for two people to share this room. There was ZERO CLOSET SPACE. Really. There was ONE DRAWER. You'd need to store all your stuff in your suitcase or on hangers which were on an open rod. There was a minibar with sodas, smoothies and waters, a few Toblerone bars, etc.Modern, efficient, VERY CLEAN, good breakfast buffet with granola, yogurt, fresh fruit, cheese, bread, herb tea, some kind of hot entree (which I never really checked out). Drawback: Wireless Internet in room supplied by swisscom. Ludicrous prices, 17 euro per 24 hour access. Never worked on my PC for some reason, had to go downstairs in the lobby and buy access per minute, although the receptionist was supernice and gave me some free extra time. I was lucky (or unlucky in that the wireless didn't work in my room) because there was only one computer available downstairs.Yeah, I'd stay here again if on business. Zero romance factor though, so unless you're 20 and don't care about anything except your hottie, don't bother going there for a luxurious, sexy weekend. For business - it's very good.

<Content>Nice rooms, great location Stayed at Caransa this weekend with friends and had a great stay.The rooms are lovely, very modern and immacuately clean. All mod cons- TV, hairdrier etcThe location of the hotel is great - surrounded by lively pubs and restaurants and only a two minute walk from the shops. Probably aroundten - fifteen mins walk from Dam square.Staff are brilliant, really friendly and very accommodating - there was probably someone different on reception each time we walked thro and they were all great. Price wise it was relatively expensive (325 euros for two nights excluding breakfast) but only compared to UK - everywhere decent in Amsterdam is like that,If getting taxi from station or indeed anywhere in the city, be sure to agree a price first, we got fleeced once or twice. Taxi fromstation was station was 20 euros and it is no way that far.The only people I would not recommend this hotel is those who want to stay somewhere quiet - the location is very busy and a bit noisy (not horrendous tho) - and if you are a couple who object to sleeping in two single beds made up as a double (altho most places in the Holland are like that).I would return to this hotel and would recommend it to others

<Content>Definately recommend this hotel... I am just back from a three night stay in this hotel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I booked the hotel only a few days before going but we still had a lovely room. It was very modern with a mini bar which didn't charge you everytime you moved something which was handy because you could buy your own drinks and put them in the mini bar. Our room was quite small probably because we booked late but it had a lovely window which practically took up the whole of one wall. We were on the third floor at the back of the hotel overlooking houses... being at the back worked out perfectly... it was so quiet even at the weekend... so if you want no noise whatsoever book a room at the back of the hotel. One thing that bugged me was we had no iron or ironing board in the room... I went down to reception and told them and within seconds there was an iron and an ironing board in the room. The air conditioning also was always on I couldn't get it off but it didn't affect us so it was grand. Oh ya one major thingthat I think the hotel could easily rectify is to put a full a full lenght mirror in the room... I found this annoying but at least therewas one in the lift. The bathroom was very small but it was absolutely spotless and the shower was one of the best I have ever used... very powerful. The bathroom products were amazing there was a hairbrush, a comb, a toothbrush kit, a shaving kit, a sponge, an exfoliating pad, soaps and designer shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. Even if you had just used one thing once they gave you another new one the next day. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel does not have a bar or a restaurant but it really doesn't affect you if you are off all day and night and using the hotel just to relax or sleep. It gives you an excuse to find some bars and restaurants around Amsterdam. After seeing alot of the other hotels I had been thinking of staying in I think the Caransa is the best onefor a few reasons... it is modern, spotlessly clean, has great staff,is centrally located, in the best location I think for seeing everything in Amsterdam and it is in a safe area... I felt alot saferwalking around here at night than other areas in the city. Also the tram stop is right outside the hotel which is very handy and very cheap... buy a strip card for 6.80 in a shop it works out cheaper than paying everytime you get on. I would definately recommend a tripto the following Artis Zoo, Anne Frank's House, the Ice Bar and the Aussie bar on Rembrant Square (happy hour every day at 5 - 6pm and 10 -11pm, cocktails are only 3 euro and they are gorgeous). We went to the Sea Palace Chinese Restaurant it is very impressive but to be honest the food isn't great and it is quite expensive for what you get... I wouldn't go back there again. Just be careful in the Red Light District of pick pocketers especially around the lanes... we were followed one day. Overall this hotel is brilliant and located in a perfect location... definately worth a stay and Amsterdam is definately worth visiting.

<Content>Loved the hotel and the area Stayed here for 3 nights end of july, for my dads 70th birthday. Well what can i say, what a good hotel based in a great square. got the tram no 9 straight outside central station and got of right outside of the hotel, check in was quick and efficient. Reception man was very helpful. All got rooms on differnt floors, but all rooms were the same, and had the same view overlooking the side street. Which was fine. Rooms were exactly as the pictures someone has posted lower down, nice big beds with clean sheets, and different pillows can be ordered. Bathroom was clean and had a nice warm power shower, plenty of shampoos and toiletries. If you are 2 ladies travelling here and staying in a room together, then there is a special ladies room, which you can request, and it is filled with womens magazines, fluffy bath robes and loads more extra pampering kits.Breakfast was great, lots of choice, from fruit, plenty of cereals, cooked breakfast, bacon is streaky but ok, loads of different breads. Dining room is fine as well, and if it is nice then you can have your breakfast on the terrace overlooking the square. Maid service again no problems. Somebody mentioned that there are no stairs, well there are. At the side of reception, and the side of the lift there are stairs which take you to the 1st floor, where the dining room is and the corridor with floor 1 on, just walk up the stairs and turn right walk down the corridor to the end passing the rooms, and at the back of the hotel there is a stairwell running up the back of the hotel. i know this because i used it to visit my sisters room, it was easier for me than getting the lift. i couldn' t fault this hotel, although it can be a bit noisy early morning, when the cafes are putting out there tabel and chairs, and the bin men are round and the street cleaners as well. But you are staying in the center of a busy square, which has some fantastic bars on it. And is well located to see everything in amsterdam, we walked everywhere.

<Content>Great Location - Good hotel Stayed here for 4 nights over bank holiday in August. Got the connexions hotel shuttle bus from the airport. Drops you right outside for 19.50 euros return trip. Hotel staff very helpful. Room was good - view not good - but if you have a room with a view you also have the noise, as the hotel is located in a busy square with many bars and a couple of disco's. Paid for BB - but cannot comment on the food as we were never up in time! The bathroom is very small but there were loads of complimentary goodies. Also Tea making and TV and Fridge, safe etc in the room. Free internet access for 15 minutes in reception if you have to check you bank account or emails!The location is fantastic with tram stops right outside the hotel - but a leisurely walk gets you to Dam Square or Singel for the flower market. The hotel staff arranged the shuttle back. All in all a brilliant time!

<Content>Claustophobics unwelcome !! No public staircase! Claustrophobics unwelcome!Arrived at NH Caranza and checked in.I asked Receptionist where the stairs where and she replied that I would have to use the lift.I told her that I was claustrophobic to which she just replied there where no stairs. I enquired about the fire exits to which she said these could not be used without a member of staff .When I asked her what other people did who didn't like lifts she said they didn' t get ' those sort of people ' staying at the hotel.She eventually summoned a memeber of staff to accompany us up the stairs. After looking at the stairs I decided these where unacceptable (I wouldn't have liked to have tried to come down these in the event of a fire) we decided not to stay there.The NH Schiller across the road was fully booked but the NH city centre had a lovely room and very good staircases.Didn't actually stay at the hotel but the receptionist was rude unhelpful and made me feel stupid.

<Content>No peace and quiet! + Very friendly staff, warm atmosphere - Our room was too noisy, so we couldn't sleep at night. The biggest problem is that the hotel is situated next to the disco.

<Content>Good location! At the end of November 2006 I stayed with my partner at the NH Caransa Hotel in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.The receptionists were all very friendly and helpful. Our room was a bit small, but well-kept and clean.Our only dislike was the fact that nothwithstanding the price of our room, we had to pay 20 Euros for 24 hours. And the 24 hours were running even though you didn't log in to internet.The hotel is on the Rembrandtplein, 1 minute walk to the trams and on walking distance to most views in Amsterdam. For gays, the Reguliersdwarstraat, where many gay bars/discos/shops/restaurants are situated, is a comfortable 5 minutes walk away.

<Content>Good hotel-great location Just returned from a two night stay at the NH Carasna and was very happy with the hotel despite it not being our first choice. The location is great and very easily reached by tram from central station. Having said that we did walk to the hotel from central station as it was early, we wanted to stretch our legs and get our bearings.It's located in the very busy Rembrantplein although it never seemed that busy the weekend we were there. The building itself it not much to look at and reception is a little dated and misleading as to the type of hotel! Our room was lovely and on the 2nd floor, not overlooking the square so I can't comment on any possible noise from there. I went prepared though, with ear-plugs as it was a must that I sleep on the first night as we were there to take part in the marathon and half-marathon races! The room was immaculately clean and also had tea and coffee making facilities. The bathroom was a little on the small size but again very clean and well stocked. The shower was very good. The rooms seem to have been modernised as of late and are very tasteful and trendy. As I said before the reception area is of older and more dated decor.The staff were very friendly and efficient. I was sent off to run with complimentary sports drinks and quickly provided with a bag of ice for my weary muscles on my return!The buffet breakfast was fine, the usual cereals, breads, cheese, ham and fruit. There is a plentiful supply of great restaurants in the area away from the more touristy ones around the square.All in all, I was very pleasantly surprised with the hotel. Its an ideal location to explore the city from and really within walking disance of everthing!

<Content>Nice Hotel Caransa! I stayed here at the end of September for a lads holiday to Amsterdam. We had some last minute changes to our booking which the hotel sorted out over the telephone very quickly. The hotel is excellently located on rembrantsplein. It takes about 10 mins max by tram from central station to get there. We were checked in very efficiently and quickly. I found all the staff to be friendly and helpful - happy to book restaurants and taxis whenever needed. Hotel room was excellent size, in top quality state and facilities very good - there's a safe in every room and plenty of storage. Bathroom good size although some of the rooms have frosted glass doors which i always find slightly bizarre. Only critiscism is that rooms at front over looking square can be quite noisy into wee small hours!There's a lot of touristy type bars in the area and its easy to get pretty much anywhere in the city from the location - i.e. museums a 10 min walk away, dam square 10 mins, coffee shop just across the sq.....One thing to note the area can get pretty lively on a Fri and Sat night and there appeared to be a bit of trouble in the area on both these nights (although this was about 2-3am). Hotel is secure though as front doors are locked at night and you gain access by pushing a bell which the night porter answers very quickly.Overall hotel was great and would definately stay again.

<Content>Fab hotel, brilliant location We have recently returned from a weekend break at the NH Caransa, what can one say. Brilliant location, everything a walk or tram ride away, we walked most places. Hotel was lovely and clean and our room on the fifth floor was huge and was located on the corner part of the hotel. Breakfast was plentiful, no complaints. Room spotless and the bed was very comfy with a good choice of pillow. Staff very helpful. Only complaints, the air con was set to high which made the room very stuffy, tried opening the windows but as the Dutch and holiday makers didnt' quiet down till 5am, this made the room to noisy. But we survived the broken sleep, however older people may prefer somewhere a little quieter in the summer months

<Content>Excellent Location Having booked this hotel speedily through Expedia we chose the NH Caransa because of its comparable price, modern bedrooms, excellent reviews on Tripadvisor and its central location to Rembrandtplein, a leafy large square filled with cafes, bars and excellent travel connections. Just a short taxi ride from Central Station (8euros) the hotel is situated amongst a row of large cafe bars with ample exterior seating - perfect for drinks and snacks whilst absorbing the laid back atmosphere of the square and ideally located for watching the inhabitants of Amsterdam -indeed the world-stroll or cycle by. The entrance of the hotel is scruffy and outdated in appearance and one could easily mistake it for having read its reviews that the hotel has recently completed its refurbishment. The hallway leading to reception is dated, dimly lit, is mirrored yet quite forbidding for a hotel that boasts it has 4 stars on its front door signage. The three of us had arrived four hours earlier than the requested 14.00hrs check in so we expected to leave our bags safely with the concierge. The check in was not as smooth as it could have been if the hotel had considered employing more than one person to handle telephone bookings, baggage handling, cash handling, settling bills, etc. for the work was clearly too much for one sole employee to handle. Nevertheless the friendly yet flustered multi-tasking receptionist informed us our room was being serviced and would be eventually ready for us circa 14.00hrs. We agreed to sample brunch at one of the external eateries nearby and we quickly fell into and alongside the laid back attitude of the Dutch whilst we absorbed the cafe society ambiance. So when our room had finally been serviced at 14.45hrs it didn鈥檛 really seem to matter to us at all! Our bags had been left safely under the stairs with the concierge so we took the lift to the fourth floor where our welcoming (thankfully) refurbished modern twin superior en suite room slept three with a comfortable fold out bed for the third person in our party. The floor to ceiling windows let in a vast amount of light and the room faced out into the square and tram stops below. The buzz of passing trams, excited holidaying Europeans, shoppers, cyclists, dog walkers and partygoers could be shut out with the double glazed windows but we seemed to not mind the noise preferring it combined with the breeze that was offered with the windows open.The beds were extremely comfortable with spotless clean white linen and there was ample room for storage for three persons. The addition of the third bed did not encroach on the room space at all and was (I was regrettably advised) very comfortable to sleep on. The bathroom with shower was clean and modern if a little on the small side for no more than one person could frequent it any one time.We did not use the breakfast service so could not comment on this or the room service that only seemed to be advertising its menus in the lift. The hotel is ideal for its location and we were all content with the modern room and comfy beds if taken aback by the shabby dated hallways and reception areas. It is perfect for exploring Amsterdam and with so many beautiful walkways and canals, street side eateries, excellent shopping and a travel system that so, so easily puts the UK to shame one does not really wish to stay in a hotel room for any long period than necessary for fear of missing out on what beautiful Amsterdam has to offer.

<Content>One of the best We just come back from Holland, and stayed 7 weeks at the Caransa hotel. We've stayed in many hotels around the world, from 3 to 5 stars, but the Caransa ranks with the best. Not as flashy as some, but very clean, excellent staff who all speak English and at least another language besides Dutch. Breakfast is plentyful with a choice of two restaurants, one at the Caransa, and the other and bigger and very cosy at the Schiller across the Rembrandts Plein, one of the great nightspots in Amsterdam.Nothing but praise for this excellent establishment.

<Content>Cold days in Amsterdam The location is excellent! The plaza and tram is right in front of the hotel and the hotel is just walking distance to most tourist spots. A busy area during the time we went there (March) but I鈥檓 sure it will be busier during the summer vacation time due to cafes and restaurants that are outside the front door. We were assigned on the third floor overlooking the Rembrandtplein. If you leave the windows open, it is quite noisy sometimes. A big help is to close the windows. The room is modern of white and apple green with a TV, phone, pay internet connection  an in-room safe. Full sized beds were quite comfortable and as we were 3 in our group, we asked for a rollaway bed. Bathroom is spacious, with a bath and hand held shower (No shower curtains available - 1/3 glass door attached instead). Hairdryer and toiletries are also available. Mirror is enormous but not friendly with those who are height challenged. We were early when we arrived on our first day, so we left our baggages with the concierge. Ate our breakfast with their sister hotel (NH Schiller) which is just across. When we returned we were assigned on the 3rd floor. Across our room, however, is a glass exit door, pass a metal stairway that leads outside (a fire exit door). The building is still in the process of renovation and you will see construction workers on certain floors. On our 2nd day, we went out early to see the sites then came back at about 9:00p. The door of our room was slightly open and upon further investigation, the in-room safe was open and all CASH  JEWELRIES are gone!! They left us our important papers (passports, airline tickets鈥?. We called the concierge to report this and after a few minutes the night manager came up (Mr. Lips). He was not very happy about this, even insinuating that we left our door open. We wanted to call the police but he said that the police will not come on such a situation especially at night. He gave us the address of the police station to go to and we went to report it the following morning. They offered to transfer us to another room. The following day, we transferred to the 6th floor. When you travel to another country or place, comfort is very important after a very tiring day. But safety is the No. 1 priority. This is our second time in Amsterdam. If we have a chance to go back to Amsterdam, will we stay again in NH Caransa? 鈥 big NO!!.

<Content>Great location Having visited Amsterdam seven times, each in a different hotel, finally we have found one we would return to. Despite signs claiming renovation work in progress, we didn't hear a thing. The hotel room was modern and clean with all of the amenities you would expect from a four star hotel. Our visit was over Easter and the constant supply of chocolate eggs in reception was a nice touch! Only thing that stops us rating the hotel 5/5 was the lack of a full-length mirror in the room, other than that, a great hotel in a great location, we will return to this one.

<Content>Good modern hotel in a great area Very good modern hotel, although some renorvation work was being done at the time of our stay (March 2006)and we had to take breakfast at the Schiller Hotel opposite (very good breakfast and vouchers for free drinks to compensate)we would still recommned it.Room was a very good size, very clean and quiet as it was on the side of the hotel. Staff helpfull.Plenty of bars around the area, would highly recommend the food at the Bell Inn Pub opposite.Tram stop right outside the front door for ease of getting about.

<Content>Loved the Caransa! We arrived on a Friday evening and checked in very smoothly. Staff were friendly and spoke very good english. We were very impressed with the room as on reading Trip Advisor comments beforehand we were a little apprehensive. They are having some renovations done so we could have breakfast in their sister hotel across the square which was equally lovely. The renovation work was done after 9am on the Saturday and Monday but we were up anyway as we were out doing things so it did not bother us. I would definitely recommend this hotel as its central, modern and clean with helpful staff.

<Content>Very disappointed with NH Caransa. I stayed at The NH Caransa at the end of Novemeber 2005 with my fiance. We travelled to Amsterdam for a weekend break, and had high expectations of the Caransa.We arrived at the hotel at around 20:00 and were told that the hotel was in the process of being refurbished and were given earplugs! We didn't hear a sound from the builders but instead had the noise of a pub/club underneath until the early hours of the morning. We were allocated a tiny room which was dark, with awful decor, and a small, very draughty window with a view of a wall inches ahead and a fire escape to the left.On a positive note, the hotel reception and our room were both immaculate (apart from another guests empty bottle under the bed). The bathroom was on the small side but spotless, with the usual complementary toiletries. The reception staff spoke excellent English and were very professional. The hotel is in an excellent location, with a tram stop right outside and aproximate 10 minuite walk to the centre. I would probably stay in the area again, but would definately not recommend this hotel to friends or family.
