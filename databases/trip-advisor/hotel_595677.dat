<Content>Best hotel in Beijing! Simply the best hotel in Beijing (been in quite a few); its main advantages are quite reasonable prices, extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff, very nice rooms (had executive suite - very nice), quietness, super-efficient housekeeping twice a day... Will stay there again, definitely!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Experience Spent four nights at the Park Plaza and enjoyed every minute that we were there. Major highlight was the incredible conceriege service who we not only consulted with before heading out each day but frequently called while we were out to ask for help scheduling tours, making dinner reservations, etc. Additionally, the nicely decorated, clean rooms and the hotel's proximity to Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City and the popular Wangfujing shopping area contributed to a most pleasant stay. I'd recommend this hotel for anyone taking a trip to Beijing.

<Content>Best hotel EVER I cannot get over how wonderful this hotel was! After a long walk from Beijing railway station (we caught the bus from the airport to the station since we were told it was apparently close by) we were greeted by a friendly doorboy (who we later found out was Byron )who immediatly came over, cracked a joke and then helped us with our luggage and got us ready to check in.The front desk service as we checked in were wonderful, polite, friendly and extremly helpful and spoke in fluent english. The staff were amazing and made our stay wonderful. The door boys were extremly funny especially Byron who kindly helped us with any enquiries we had about getting to places and always warmly greeted us when we came back from our daily adventures! When we were about to leave Park Plaza to our next hotel to Xi'an, I asked if the staff could translate our next hotel in written Manadarin, and they happily went onto the internet to get all the details for me and were so friendly! Conceirge were great in even getting a maxi taxi for us since we were going to catch the train to the airport.Our room was fantastic. The beds were big, bathrooms were clean, 2 water bottles were provided each day, and the heating system was great since it was very cold outside! TV also had lots of english shows such as HBO, MTV, Discovery etc. The restaurant was clean and very nice to eat in although the price of the drinks were very pricey ? I think they were almost the same as the food! Other than that, the staff were great and remebered us sicne we ate there almost every night for our 5 night stay!Overall Park Plaza was the best hotel I stayed in! We stayed in the most terrible hotels in Xi'an and Shanghai and funnily enough our hotel in Shanghai was 4 star and was horrendus!! it wasn't even half as good as park plaza!again the staff were so friendly with all their smiling faces, and they made it very enjoyable for us! definatly will be coming back here!

<Content>Convenient location - 5 star quality The rooms, service including food, and all amenities such as gym and internet were what you would expect of the Plaza franchise. We were there before the Olympics so the room rates were only $150/night but were due to skyrocket later for a 4-5star hotel. Very clean with new fittings. Lots of tv channels but could use more english ones. good study area but have to pay for internet service in room.Food in restaurant was good as was the general hotel staff.

<Content>good value hotel, service people need to think more The hotel is centrally localized, and a great value for the cost. The room was very nice, clean and quiet. The bathroom is high quality and functional. The internet is free. My only complain is after I came back from the trip. They charged me twice for the stay. I booked the hotel through Orbitz and prepaid. I even gave them a copy of my voucher showing that I have paid. The manager on duty seemed to have understood it fine. However, the other front desk people obviously most function as flower-vases. When we checked in, the manager was instructing everyone to get him this and that. When we checked out, unfortunately, the manager was not on duty. The staff were left to themselves, and the lack of brain showed. The credit card was only supposed to be for incidentals. However, they charged the room on it without our approval and without any reciepts (of course). This happened after we left the hotel. Of course we could fight the charge off through the credit card. But what a waste of time and energy. If they only train their staff better or use someone with a brain!

<Content>Wonderful Experience This is an excellent hotel and deserves the high ratings of this website. It's a solid 4-star hotel, but priced more competitively. The Park Plaza has a great location within walking distance of the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Sq. A Starbucks is located right outside the front door, so you can grab a quick, cheap breakfast before you start the day. Their sister 5-star Regent hotel is connected via a short walkway, which has more upscale bars and restaurants. The Park Plaza is located behind the Regent and another office building, so it's not on the street. This means that the rooms are quiet. However, it might be hard for a taxi driver to find. I recommend that you take the hotel's card from the bellman before you head out for the day. Rooms were newly furnished and well appointed. Bed was extremely comfortable. The restaurants (I tried the Western and Japanese) were excellent and reasonably priced. Service was superb. All staff spoke English well, and eager to please. They really went out of their way to make sure that you didn't wait for anything. One of the most pleasurable hotels that I've stayed at on vacation. Park Plaza is part of the Radisson/Regent hotel chain, so you can earn/use Goldpointsplus. Only drawback was at check-out. Despite being shown a bill in the local currency, Chinese yuan (CNY) also called Renminbi (RMB), the hotel's credit card machine converted the amount into US dollars on the spot, without my consent, at an unfavorable rate - equal to about a 3% surcharge. Other charges in local currency to my credit card on the same day from other merchants resulted in a much better conversion rate. I was able to get the hotel to refund the surcharge, but it was a hassle.

<Content>Not sure why this hotel is so popular Not sure why this hotel has been so popular with TA readers. We chose it because of its popularity and was quite disappointed. We were there for 6 nights during October. There was a mess up with our booking when we arrived and by 2nd day, it developed into a Faulty Tower drama, all due to their poor internal communication. There were so many issues with the room (long story). The final straw came on day 2 when we returned to the hotel after a full day out to find our luggage etc were no longer in the room. Instead someone else's luggage was in our room . While the whole episode may sound funny now, it was such a shock to us at the time, finding our things gone!. We had their buffet breakfast everyday (included in the tariff). Quality of the food was generally poor. They could do a lot better in their Chinese food selection. After all, we were in China.

<Content>Warning! Do not book this hotel! The InterContinental Financial Street Beijing hotel is far better than this hotel! I'm baffled why the Park Plaza is higher up in the ratings. this is the first travel review I've ever written and it's to make sure you make an informed choice, because I picked this hotel on the strength of it's ranking here and quite frankly, I was very disappointed. Everything in life is comparative of course, and the Park Plaza is actually an ok hotel - the staff are indeed lovely, but it just doesn't compare to the InterContinental Financial Street Beijing. The Park Plaza is slightly dated, has no pool and the decor / rooms are nowhere near as swish. And the breakfast not as good either. So if you're looking for luxury, good service and great food, try the InterContinental Financial Street Beijing hotel - you won't regret it...

<Content>You have to try it! We stayed in a Plaza Club room with afternoon High Tea included between 5.30 and 7.30 p m each day. Maybe some tea was available, but we went for the drinks and delicatessen table where there was everything you could wish! On top of that, staff and standard of the entire hotel were out-of-the-ordinary excellent at a very reasonable price!A Svensson, Sweden

<Content>Great staff I stayed at the Park Plaza as part of a tour group. The stay was fantastic from start to finish. Every member of staff did absolutely everything possible to make us welcome. A big thank you to Bessie and her staff at The First Bar for their impeccable service each night. Rooms are of a very good standard with plenty of space and full kit of amenities in the bathroom. You can use the wired internet in your room or the wifi at the bar/reception area, both are free. All in all I would definitely recommend the Park Plaza if you are travelling to Beijing.

<Content>Loved the Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing My husband and I stayed at the Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing for 5 nights in mid-October at the beginning of a two week tour of China. I booked the hotel based on very positive reviews on Tripadvisor and was not disappointed. This was the best hotel we stayed at during our trip. I stayed in a superior room and it was spacious, clean, and nicely decorated. The bathroom was huge! The two bottles of complimentary water were appreciated as you can not drink tap water anywhere in China. There is a nice convenience store around the corner that sells bottled water for 2 RMB and IP phone cards (I bargained for 70 RMB down from 100 RMB). The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The concierge was able to arrange tickets to the Legend of Kung Fu and the China Acrobatic Troupe at Chaoyang Theatre. I also arranged for a driver to the Great Wall Mutianyu, through the concierge, for 800 RMB. The hotel has a wonderful location and is only a short commute to the major sites and in walking distance of the Forbidden City. I used taxis exclusively for travel and the bell boy was excellent at telling the taxi driver where we wanted to go. However, returning to the hotel was challenging! Several taxi drivers had to call for directions after getting us in the general area of the hotel. However, the overall benefits of the hotel far outweighed this inconvenience. I do advise having the hotel email you a map so that when you arrive at the airport the taxi driver will have the best shot at locating the hotel. But, don't be surprised if the taxi driver still has to call for directions as ours did. Our room rate included breakfast and the breakfast buffet was the best of any of the hotels we stayed at during our trip. The buffet offered both American and Asian cuisine and the dishes varied from day to day. The food was excellent! I also enjoyed having Starbucks just across the road-a nice place to unwind at the end of a busy day of sightseeing. I am recommending this hotel to all my friends who are planning trips to Beijing.I wanted to share a few tips from my experience touring in Beijing.1. I always flagged legitimate taxis and the drivers always used the meter. Only once did a taxi driver try to negotiate a price without using the meter and my husband and I just walked away and hailed another taxi passing on the street. There is absolutely no need to do business with black cabs with legitimate ones being readily available.2. Don't be suprised if taxi drivers have difficulty finding theatres. I was surprised that the drivers didn't know Beijing better than they did. However, I always got to the right place eventually.3. Although the Legend of Kung Fu was recommended to me by friends, the show was actually not worth the time or money. It was rather boring and my husband and I were relieved when it was over.4. I tried very hard to get tickets to the Beijing Acrobatics Troupe at Wansheng Theatre, but was unable to secure tickets through my travel agency outside China or through the hotel concierge. As this theatre reportedly has the best acrobatic show, I was puzzled as to how no one seemed to know anything about the show. The concierge was able to get tickets to Chaoyang Theatre and I felt the performance was satisfactory.5. The Great Wall Mutianyu was the highlight of our Beijing trip. I followed recommendations made by other Tripadvisor reviewers and arrived at approximately 9:30 a.m. (I left the hotel at 8:00 a.m.). I strongly recommend taking the cable car up and then walking left on the Great Wall first. This, in my opinion, was the most impressive portion of the Great Wall. If you walk it first thing in the morning you will have it mostly to yourself. Most tourists take the chair lift up and start walking the Great Wall from the far right end making this section crowded and more touristy. Also, if you start walking at the extreme right end of the wall you won't likely have the energy to walk to the far left end of the Great Wall. The hike can get very steep at times and my husband and I were surprised at how tiring it was after 4 hours of hiking. However, if you start at the cable car and walk left to the end where it is blocked off and then walk right and end at the chair lift and toboggan entrance, it is a very pleasant 3.5 to 4 hour hike without the tourist crowds to contend with. Most tour groups only hike from the chair lift and then go down on the cable car. My husband and I took the toboggan down and that was a fun end to our Great Wall experience.6. The Olympic venues were open for touring during our stay in mid-October. For 50 RMB/person you can visit the Bird's Nest. I believe it opened for touring at 9:00 a.m. and closed at 6:30 p.m. It was beautiful to visit at around 5:00 p.m. so it could be seen both during daylight and lit up at night. The Water Cube is also open for touring, but I missed touring it as it closed earlier at 5:00 p.m.7. The best people watching areas in Beijing are the parks. I loved visiting Bei Hai Park and Temple of Heaven Park. It was great fun to see the locals ballroom dancing under the trees and to watch 300 people spontaneously gather for a sing along. 8. Beware of rickshaw drivers in and near the Hutong. My husband and I just wanted to walk this area on foot, but it was frustrating to have to deal with verbally abusive rickshaw drivers every few feet. I was surprised that the drivers thought their bullying would actually result in a fare. All it made me want to do was get away from them as quickly as possible. A final note of the Hutong-skip Prince Gong's Mansion-it is highly overrated and just crawling with Chinese tourists-it is hard to even move around the grounds and the Mansion is no longer offering the mini Chinese Opera performance.The 5 days we had in Beijing were some of the best of our entire trip in no small part because of the wonderful hotel and staff. This hotel is a great find.

<Content>Excellent Staff A friend and I stayed at the Park Plaza Wangfujing in Beijing and had a great experience. The location was very close to a subway stop, the Wanfujing Shopping Area and about 10 minute walk to Tian'namen Square. The hotel is new and nice. Breakfast was included with plenty of Asian and Western options. The guys at the concierge desk were helpful, professional and nice to talk to. It was my first time in Beijing and they got us a private driver for a day trip to the Great Wall and recommended a great local restaurant--best food we had during the trip. And thanks to Hong, I brought home some really great new CDs of popular Chinese music.

<Content>Other reviews are spot on Earlier reviews of the Park Plaza were spot on and led us to that hotel. Friendly employees, nice and well appointed rooms, very clean and excellent location.A few hints may be helpful to others. 1. When I made reservations for 2 rooms the only rate available was the full one. I checked a couple weeks later and they had a AAA rate that was about $50/night less. So I cancelled the first reservation and made a new one at the AAA rate. 2. Be aware that they add a 15% surcharge to everything - room, bar and dining room. 3. If breakfast is not included in your rate, the Starbucks just a few feet away, is a good alternative. 4. Email the hotel and they will send you a map in Chinese that you can give the taxi driver at the airport to help him find the hotel. The taxi cost is about 100 yaun.

<Content>Good hotel in good location I stayed at this hotel at the beginning of my recent trip to Beijing. I used membership points partially toward the stay so my actual cost was about 1/2 the usual rate.Upon checkin I was upgraded to a club level room, a nice touch-- though I was not given access to the club features on the floor. The room was good sized and clean.English at this hotel was serviceable, both at the front desk and at the concierge. In China the concierges typically speak pretty limited English so that was a nice plus.I would say the real highlight of this hotel is the location though. It is around the corner from the very easy to use Beijing subway and is very close to the night market. One note: I printed out a map of the location from the hotel's website (with Chinese street names) before I flew in so I could show it to the taxi driver at the airport. Unfortunately the font on the image was very small and the driver could not read it. So make sure you print it large otherwise you'll be driving around downtown Beijing for a while if you're not lucky.

<Content>the BEST place to stay in Beijing! My husband and I booked this hotel based on the wonderful reviews here on T.A. We were not disappointed. I asked the hotel to send directions in Chinese, which was very helpful to the taxi driver. The hotel is not easy to find for most drivers as we found out. We arrived late (11pm) and check-in went smoothly. We were asked if we would like to pay for breakfast or an upgrade - we declined both, but were upgraded anyway for free! The staff spoke excellent english, which was a huge benefit as we do not know much Mandarin Chinese. In fact, the whole staff was beyond wonderful, from the bellboys, to the doormen, to the waitresses in the lounge! Thank you!!! We booked a private driver for our trip to the Great Wall, which I would recommend doing. When you need a taxi, the doormen help with everything and make sure the taxi knows where to go and that we have their number in case of a problem. Our room was very comfortable and spacious. There are many TV channels in English and the bathroom was large and modern. We enjoyed having the Starbucks right across from us as well. We did a lot of walking - the hotel has a great location with an easy walk to the Forbidden City, etc. If you need ANYTHING, the hotel is eager to help! We would not hesitate to stay here again. Side notes:We took 5 different taxis and 3 were good, 2 tried to take advantage of us. One taxi thought we wouldn't notice if they demanded we pay for the toll (there is a toll both after leaving the airport). We had been through this toll before and knew better - the taxi driver should pay. He also took us in circles before we started to argue about his driving. After arriving at the hotel, we had the doormen of the Park Plaza translate for us and the taxi driver gave us our money back. Be sure you take official taxis as well. We took one from the Summer Palace to the hotel that wasn't an official taxi, but we thought we could handle the driver. He drove us within a block of the hotel and parked (refusing to go up to the doormen who would recognize a con artist) and his meter was way off. We negotiated a lower fare because we knew what the taxi should cost. He accepted, but gave us fake currency for change, which we discovered after getting back to our room. So, do NOT take an unofficial taxi. The official ones are black. Do not be afraid to negotiate rates - this is expected in China. The subway is much better than taking a taxi - it is modern and fast and convenient and there is a subway stop right behing the Park Plaza!

<Content>Perfect Hotel My family (wife, 3 kids aged 12, 10 and 5 and myself) spent a week at this hotel earlier this month (Oct 08). This was the start of a China and Southeast Asia trip. We booked directly, based on tripadvisor reviews.After a 19 hour journey Via Singapore we were really tired and wanted a quick check in and a soft bed, we got both plus much more.The entire hotel is in great condition probably for the olympics. It is situated slightly off Jinbao and is seconds away from both the Regent and Peninsula hotels as well as other 5 star hotels. We were given two rooms interconnecting one with three single beds the other a king, the rate included breakfast which is good when travelling with kids. The rooms are absolutely perfect and we loved the feather pillows. Unfortunately we could hear our neighbours opening cupboards etc which was a little annoying early in the morning.All in all the best hotel we stayed at in China rdifficult to fault, and we would not hesitate to return. Finally I mentioned to the hotel that the trip was to celebrate my wifes birthday, they sent magnificent flowers and fruit as well as a very sweet card up for our arrival.Breifly to sum upPROS-Really comfortable bedsAll the extras you could want (iron and board, fridge, free bottles of water etc etc.Room very clean and new looking.Great location close to Wangfujing easy walk, and really close to Dengshikou MRT 92 minutes if you go the right way, just ask the doorman.Adequate breakfastWell appointed furnishings.Exceptionally helpful and friendly staff.Turndown.CONS-Only one unfortunately you can hear the people in the next room opening cupboards and drawers. This could have been just this room or those specific neighbours as I have not read any reviews mentioning this. Do yourself a favour and stay in this hotel you will not regret it.

<Content>loved the park plaza beijing The Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing was the highlight of our two week trip to China. Our room was beautiful, the hotel staff always made us feel special and they did everything they could to help us, the breakfasts were fantastic, and the happy hour nightly (actually two hours because it ran from 5:30 - 7:30 pm) were so much fun that we seldom went out for dinner after that. They served appetizers, fruit, desserts, and drinks free of charge. The hotel also offered free internet and free tea or coffee (including fancy coffees) all day long. The concierge was most helpful, as were all the young men who worked at the hotel front.

<Content>The BEST hotel in Beijing I'm still staying at the Park Plaza Beijing as I write this. I'm sending this on complimentary in-room broadband. I just had to write this review after the most recent reviewer trashed this great hotel. BEWARE the disgruntled reviewer! I guess you can't please everybody. The majority of reviews speak for themselves.I booked this hotel weeks ago online and although we arrived early, we were able to go to our room right after finishing a leisurely latte at the Starbucks across the way. We had a wonderfully pressured hot shower which was great after the red-eye flight.Headed out to explore Beijing by hopping on the subway which was just round the corner.October is a good time to be in Beijing, the weather is mild and conducive to walking from Wangfujing, the main shopping and dining district to the Park Plaza.

<Content>Out of Rooms? We had a travel agent book this hotel only because of the rating on Trip Advisor. We were on the last week of a two week business trip to China and checking in after midnight. We just wanted to go to bed when the front desk informed us they had no more rooms even though we did pay upfront to make sure we had a room. They moved us to their sister hotel The Regent, which was very nice but we could have picked any 5 star in Beijing, we did not need them to pick it for us. We picked Park Plaza for a reason. Beware, confirm they have room!

<Content>modern hotel room We stayed here in July 2008 as part of a stopover that unfortunately only allowed one night rather than two, due to flight delays. The hotel room was very comfortable and had all the mod cons. Unfortunately our Aussie credit cards (both visa and mastercard) did not work in this hotel!! Ridiculously, we had to pay cash on arrival, which meant that we used our spending money all in one go on the bond. Then as we were leaving, we had all this cash to spend and no time to spend it! The staff were friendly, especially the concierge staff who went out of the way to help us. Can someone please tell us where that close train station was?! We walked for kilometres to find one. We do believe you all though!....Just make sure you get good directions from the hotel or catch a taxi so you don't end up hot and bothered by the time you get there like us! We thought the 15% surcharge to have a few drinks from the bar was ridiculous, so much for their happy hour!!

<Content>Great hotel - super location - look no further! I recently stayed at this hotel for nights while in Beijing. Great hotel choice. Very courteous service and very helpful. The rooms are a good size equipped with little extras like robes, slippers, complimentary water daily, many English TV channels and great water pressure! The hotel also helped to organized tours and tickets - very helpful. The rooms were very clean and the beds comfortable. I have recommended this hotel to friends that are going to Beijing in a few months. I would definitely stay here again. There is a subway station around the corner too!

<Content>Lovely Beijing Hotel We recently stayed at the Park Plaza for four nights while in Beijing. The rooms were lovely and well kept, the staff was extremely courteous and helpful and the food was adequate but not exciting. I would suggest that folks consider skipping the breakfast option as they have a limited selection and you'll probably want to venture out into Beijing where the food is much cheaper once you leave the hotel.Aside from the stylish and comfortable room and the free internet (although not wi fi), the biggest plus of this hotel is definitely the location directly beside the subway. We took the subway everywhere in Beijing from the Olympic Park, Forbidden City and beyond (it's about 40 cents USD per person, per trip!!) without any problems.And there is a Starbucks across the street if you yearn for a little western culture...

<Content>A very comfortable stay I stayed in this hotel for one night after roughing it out in Yunnan province (RMB 920 after taxes for a superior room with 1 queen bed). It is an excellent business hotel. Customer service was by and large excellent - fast check-in, helpful concierge (directions, baggage storage, message delivery), great gym service (attendant served water, provided towels personally), and good in-room breakfast service that takes orders until 3 am and begins serving at 6. The room was very stylish for a business hotel - great bed (not too hard or soft), good lighting, high ceilings and both new and clean. Tasteful washroom facilities. Free internet (cable provided) with ok speed and bandwidth. Location is a 5 minute walk to Wangfujing Street and is beside the massive Regency Hotel and another local chain. For a hotel in the US$100-120 range it's a solid, comfortable stay. No complaints here.

<Content>Great Hotel in a Fantastic City The hotel is in an excellent location which I think is its main selling point. The rooms could be bigger but what you would expect from hotel rooms in any large city.We walked everywhere (good walking shoes are a must) and we also used the subway which is very close to the hotel. We didn鈥檛 eat in the hotel restaurant but we did have our breakfast there every morning which was great. There is continental type breakfast and Chinese style, all of which were excellent.The staff were attentive but on some occasions English was a problem, however it would be unfair of me not to congratulate the staff for their use of English which 9 out of 10 times was superb!!We drank in the hotel bar once and it was expensive and they add a 15% service charge to your bill. Water was supplied everyday but if you need some more at any stage, there is a little shop just across the road from the Hotel beside Starbucks.The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Wangfujing Shopping Street which is always hectic but worth a visit. Also just beside the shopping street (just go straight across the junction at Wangfujing shopping street) a food market is held every night. Its worth walking up to see this as the sell all sorts of wonderful things to eat. If sheep鈥檚 penis or indeed Dog hotpot is your thing鈥his is the place for you.If you are looking for a more Western Style fantastic meal, I would highly recommend a restaurant called the Courtyard. This restaurant is right beside the Forbidden City (ask for a window seat) and the views and food are fantastic. It is expensive (拢70 per bottle of wine) but worth every penny.The only other advice I can give on Beijing is that public toilets are pretty poor so hold your breath and get in and out ASAP. Also there is a lack of soap in all but hotel toilets. Take loads of Antibacterial gels and wipes. You鈥檒l be lost without them and probably get a dodgy stomach. Lucky we went prepared. I鈥檓 obsessed with clean hands and neither I nor my husband got sick our entire holiday.I can鈥檛 recommend Beijing or the Park Plaza hotel enough.

<Content>Wonderful hotel We recently stayed at the Park Plaza, everything about the hotel was superb. The location is very close to the city centre, there is a subway station right behind the hotel and it is safe to walk around.The rooms were great, and breakfast was good, on our last day we went down early before the breakfast started and they served us anyway. The best asset of the hotel is the staff they are wonderful, the best we have ever had the pleassure of staying with. The taxi marshals could'nt do enough for you and the reception were great. Dont even think of going anywhere else.

<Content>Great hotel I agree - this is a great hotel, well managed - you can tell that from all the small thngs that they got right (as opposed to the equal-status hotle in Xi'am where I'm writing this, and al the small things are wrong and make it secnd-class). For instance, the staff were friendy and happy to chat - they seemed to be happy to be working there which is often not the case. The breakfast was the best I've had in a hotel buffet. The rooms was big enough, very clean, and well thought out, the bedroom was well-lit, bathroom toiletries just what we needed, etc. It was a pleasure to stay there. Happily, we're going back for one night at the end of this business trip and I'm delighted. One niggle - as a vegetarian, the ground flor restaurant, which is open 24 hours, didn't serve any veggie sandwiches. I had a waldorf salad one lunchtime, without the walnuts! Reminds me of Fawlty Towers in that respect) We were in a great rush so didn't complain and anway, what doyou expect if you order western food in an asian hotel? But veggie food was a bit unsatisfactory. And the restaurant itself rather enpty and cold, But again, that's what you often get if you eat in a hotel. Overall, excellent.

<Content>Great Hotel I recently stayed at the Park Plaza in Beijing. Having read the previous reviews on this site I agree that it is a great hotel. It is very handy for exploring the city of Beijing. It is close by to the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square and as taxis are cheap in Beijing it is very easy to get to the other areas of the city also. The concierge staff are excellent and will help with any of your travel requests. You must try Quanjude Peking Duck Restaurant on Wangfujing Street and for drinking and people watching go to Hou Hai in the evening. Only complaint was on arrival the hotel tried to sell us their Club package for an additional fee. Firstly we said yes but luckily they had no rooms available so we kept our superior room which was most than sufficient for our needs. In the end we were glad as we went to Starbucks each morning for breakfast (about 5 few metres from hotel entrance) and the free happy hour would have confined us each evening to being in the hotel. Would definitely recommend this hotel for a tourist stay in Beijing.

<Content>Good hotel and location A good hotel and relatively good value for money. The hotel is in a decent location, although as a westerner travelling alone it was difficult to find a suitable restaurant in the area. Thankfully the room service was excellent. Overall a good choice for a westerner visiting the city. The hotel has an arrangement with local drivers who will take you, for example, to the Great Wall. It costs more than the bus or local taxi, but it's still a good arrangement - with one catch. The driver may insist on taking you to a ceramics factory on the way, and a tea room on the way back. And in both places they'll try very hard to get you to buy something. It wasn't too over the top, but as with all of Beijing, some of the locals are trying every tourist trick in the book. Girls approaching single males to practice their English (but in reality to entice you to an extortionate bar) can be really annoying after a while. But overall, Beijing is a great place to vist. I'd definitely recommend it and the hotel.

<Content>fine to stay I stayed two nights a week after Olympic Games were over. The city is not crowded already at all. The location is good, room is clean. staffs are good. There is ntg to complain.If you insist me to complain even one point, I would say I can not believe this is a two-year-old hotel. There were already some places to be fixed in my room, that makes me think this hotel looks seven-year-old hotel.If you read my review and dont want to waste your time to find a hotel in BJ, just pick this up. You have nothing to lose as long as the price is around USD100-120.However, pls be sure that there are plenty of hotels that you would prefer to stay.

<Content>Awesome Olympic Stay Park Plaza was an excellent hotel. Having stayed at 5 star hotels in the states, this was no different. The service was great. We stayed on the club level which included a full breakfast, afternoon cocktails and snacks and 24 hour access to free internet. Well worth the extra money for the club amenities. Rooms were well appointed and bathrooms were large and spacious. Location is great, we walked everywhere. This was an IOC hotel during the Olympics so security was tight, but appreciated. We ate at Bloo restaurant and the japanese restaurant and both were reasonably priced and good. Highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good hotel It is a good, clean, high end hotel in Beijing. Although I won't rate it as highly as it is hyped.Even service and concierage is not as great.The enjoyable part is good decoration, cleanliness, comfortable rooms, very clean and well designed bathrooms and location, location, location. Its walking distance from Wangfujing and subway station which is a big plus.

<Content>Comfort, friendly staff, recommended for families We stayed at the Park Plaza for four nights with two kids (14,16) and enjoyed the comfort and really friendly and familiar atmosphere offered by the hotel. Reception, concierge desk, restaurant, bar and all other staff were very corteous. The hotel is located in walking distance to all major places of interest. Beds are just marvelous. We booked the rooms with breakfast included and that is what I would recommend. The buffet is very good, though (of course) dominated by Chinese specialities. However, for those who need their muffins and donuts - there is a Starbucks just 20 m from the hotel entrance. I recommend the Park Plaza for family trips.

<Content>Excellent hotel, fantastic location We had a wonderful 5 day stay in Beijing and loved this hotel! When we arrived we upgraded to a club suite which gave access to the Club Lounge, with afternoon snacks and refreshments, a huge buffet breakfast with everything you could imagine and a nice gym. The room was excellent, nice and modern furnished, a huge comfy bed, spacious bathroom, international cable and all necessary conveniences.The staff is over all very good and really friendly and helpful, most speak good English.The location is fantastic, a short taxi drive to all the major attractions and only a five min walk to Wangfujing and the Donghuamen night market.PSAsk for a note with the hotel name and street in Chinese, very helpful if you catch a taxi鈥?/p>

<Content>Loved this hotel!!! There is absolutely a reason this hotel was ranked #2 on the popularity index for Trip Advisory. I booked a standard room online (they offer AAA discounts) and then when we arrived, decided to upgrade to a suite for 1/2 the cost, had I booked the suite directly online. for 368RMB we got a suite, two buffet breakfasts, and happy hour every days (which included a selection of hot and cold food, and alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks). the concierge and staff in general are excellent. they all speak fantastic english and are extremely friendly and helpful. the location is fantastic - we walked to the forbidden city on two separate days. you are also walking distance to a fun night market where you get to see numerous items 'on a stick' including scorpions... the hotel arranged for a car for us to mutianyu and we had an excellent day on the great wall. i would definitely stay here again and i highly recommend it!!!!

<Content>Loved this hotel! We had a wonderful, wonderful 5-day stay at the Park Plaza Beijing in June. This hotel is really a sleeper -- neither big and over-the-top, nor boutique -- but really everything a hotel should be. The location is terrific -- close to the major attractions, and easy walking distance to Wangfujing, good restaurants, and shopping. Our room had all that we wanted, including a very comfortable bed (especially compared to other places we stayed in China), very nice linens, plenty of pillows, a well-appointed bathroom, and quiet. But what really sets the Park Plaza apart from other hotels is the service. The staff was unfailingly welcoming, helpful, and so pleasant -- really bending over backwards to make us happy. And it seemed as if everyone genuinely enjoyed what they were doing ... helping to make our stay in Beijing a special one. We stayed in much more expensive and exclusive hotels in China, and they paled in comparison to the Park Plaza. This is a place that really understands the meaning of hospitality. I strongly recommend this hotel -- you won't be disappointed! (One caveat: the restaurant, while nice for breakfast, disappointed for dinner. There are many terrific dining options in the area ... just ask the concierge for a recommendation.)

<Content>Excellent Stay After carefully reviewing tripadvisor comments I stayed at the Park Plaza for 6 nights in mid June. It really does deserve its number 2 ranking in Beijing. While not the most luxurious hotel it has all the modern amenities and comforts you could wish for (minus pool) at a great price. It really was a good deal compared to some of the other hotels I looked at : Peninsular, Regent, etc. I think the room rate outweighs the little luxuries of the other 5 -6star hotels. While there is no pool you can use the pool of the Regent which is the Park Plaza's sister hotel right next door. For about $10 you can use the beautiful pool, sauna, srteam room, jacuzzis and exercise room.I do think that the staff makes the stay even more pleasant. Concierge staff are very accommodating - especially Mr. Hong. A great young fellow. Hotel is tucked behind a main road and some taxis had a hard time finding it. Always carry the hotel business card with a little map on it. Beware some of the taxi drivers. They will drive you in circles and will plead they don't know where they are going. Hotel is a close walk to Wangfujing and of course all the main sites are only a $2-3 cab ride (unless you get the occassional round the world driver).

<Content>Excellent hotel with soft comfortable beds The best hotel we enjoyed during our month long journey through China. I give it the best rating primarily due to the comfortable beds; as most beds in China have such Firm mattresses that it feels like you are sleeping on concrete.....Our room was very spacious with a comfortable king size bed plus a sitting area with a couch, chair  table + a desk. The bathroom was filled with all the amenities we could wish for and new toothbrushes where supplied each day. All was kept spotlessly clean. We actually got a non-smoking room a huge bonus in China.There was the usual fridge, safe, writing paper, postcard etc.We did not check out either the pool or the weight room.However the cafe was great.Breakfast that came with the room was a large buffet with both hot and cold offerings. There was everything on the buffet you could possibly want along with a chef standing by to cook your eggs for you to your specifications.Two evenings we enjoyed a wonderful American Dinner of steak in the restaurant. I wanted to share the meal with my Dad as neither of us wanted a full dinner. When we explained this to the waitress it was not a problem and the kitchen actually split the meal and it arrived on 2 plates beautifully presented.The non-smoking area was approximtely half the size of hte restaurant. It was a real bonus after being in Asia for a month to actually be able to enjoy a meal without having a smoker light up at the table next to ours.The staff at the front desk were very accomodating about exchanging money.There was a Starbucks next door and a neighbourhood shop just around the corner to buy inexpensive pop and junk food at.About a 3 block walk brought you to a shopping area and there were lots of restaurants close to the hotel.The only glitch as a very slow check in and I had to argue to get the room which we had reserved and paid for. They wanted to give me a room with 2 single beds instead of a superior room with a king size bed. However this is not so unusual when one checks in late at night....I would definitely recommend this hotel as a good place to stay for anyone heading to Beijing.

<Content>Very nice and cozy hotel This is a very nice and cozy hotel located in the center of beijing but in the inner street of a commercial complex, which makes it very quiet... Its a relatively new hotel, very clean and modern, the decoration is very simple so its almost relaxing, the staff is very friendly, specially the concierges who are very helpful with directions and helping you out with your plans...The breakfast buffet is very good and even the dinner buffet is worth it if you are too tired to go out.... the hotel and meals are not expensive at allTip: Always have a card with the hotel directions in chinese so the taxi drivers know how to get there.. they are puzzled when they see the address since its a very small street but they often call either the hotel or someone to explain it to them.... Hand them the address once you are in the cab because if you show it to them before getting in and they dont know how to get there they may refuse to take you (happened to me a couple of times)

<Content>Fabulous Staff We stayed at this hotel from the 25th to the 30th of May. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel, particularly about the Concierge Department. Their command of the english language was fabulous, they were extremely helpful and could not do enough for us, assisting us with booking our train tickets to Xian, booking day trips to the Great Wall as well as a fabulous Hutong Tour. They also took care of our luggage when we went to Xian. We received a lovely welcome back on our return from Xian. The reception counter, although were helpful, were not able to assist us quite as efficiently due to their lack of command of the English language. The hotel was set back off the street and was therefore very quiet, it is the sister hotel of the Regent Hotel which was right next door. The Starbucks across from the hotel was well utilized as was the ATM machine in the same building. The rooms were great, beds were comfortable and a good size and the bathroom was great. We were very sad to leave this great hotel. I can see why it is rated number two on trip advisor. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent! Stayed here May 24-30th and absolutely loved it. I'm ultra-picky with hotels, so draw your own conclusions! Staff friendly  helpful and always plenty on hand to advise. Uniformed doormen always on duty, and willing/able to help. Building is gorgeous inside, and very much what you'd expect from a 5-star hotel in Europe. Think InterContinental. Nice softly-lit lobby, and bar area. Room was spacious and comfortable - very clean, stylish, well-appointed, and large impressive bathroom. Robes  slippers supplied. We stayed in a standard room. Room was no. 502 and had a view to a side street - great for avoiding street noise. Breakfast not included, and was offered at RMB 159 pp, plus 15% cover charge, or a deal of RMB 220 per couple, to include happy hour drinks. In truth, this was the only let-down, as these prices (esp in China) are just bonkers. That's about 拢12 for a buffet meal, whereas that would get you dinner for 2 anyplace else in Beijing. Anyhow, there's a Starbucks across the way, but that's also (relatively) expensive. Ate in 'Oodles' restaurant, and were the only people there (the hotel restaurants don't seem to be busy at all). Food was nice - a bit pricey by Beijing standards - but ultra-cheap by Western standards. About RMB 45 per dish. Good sushi. Service was smiling, attentive - and their command of English will just put you to shame. Transport-wise: yes, as per other comments you'll always need the address in Chinese - and once our taxi dropped us off at the sister Regent Hotel - but OK as it's just in front of Park Plaza. The little card you get with your room keys has a fold-out map of the area, with place names in Chinese - so you can just show that to taxi drivers. You can enter the new subway Line 5 directly next to the Regent - it's really impressive, cheap (RMB 2 per ticket any distance), and easy to navigate. But if there are 2 or 3 of you, taxis maybe just as cheap - rarely paid more than around RMB 15 for rides of about 20 mins. You can hail them anywhere on the street. Taxi to/from airport should not cost more than RMB 100. No tipping. Driving  traffic can be very scary - so buckle up. There's a little convenience store just near the intersection with Jinyu Hutong and Dongsi Nandajie - a few mins walk from hotel. You can stock up there on water etc. But you do get 2 free bottles per day in your room. Also Thai vegetarian, Japanese - and of course Chinese - restaurants all within minutes walk of hotel. Safe, pleasant area. Staff smile and wave at you. Isn't that nice.

<Content>unexpected upgrade not much to say about this place--we had booked an executive level room and after a long flight from AU were unexpectedly upgraded to a great room at the Regent next door! No idea why--the foyer looked deserted and the hotel did not feel booked out. On a subsequent flight we met a traveller who had had exactly the same experience. Worth asking for??

<Content>Good hotel, great location Recently stayed 4 nights at this hotel in a deluxe room. Enjoyed the stay very much. The room was comfortable and clean and had an ok view. The hotel is nice. We ate in the restaurant, Bloo, one night, the food was good but the restaurant was empty, which was a shame. Location is good, set back from the main street and within walking distance to main shopping area and we walked to parks within about 1/2 hour.Overall, I would stay at this hotel again. Downpoint was no free internet access and cost of use in the business centre is pricey compared to other places.

<Content>Really enjoyed the Park Plaza I'm in the middle of a stay here and really enjoy it. Staff is excellent, English is pretty good, location fantastic - right next to the Regent hotel but cheaper and set back from Jinbao Street so it's a bit quieter too. Being set back can be a bit difficult for a taxi driver but it's not too hard. Subway station just down the block (at the base of the Regent), Starbucks next door for a taste of home if, like me, you've been gone a while. Lei Garden on the 3rd floor of the Jinabo Tower is a good choice for food, and there are ATMs at the front of Jinbao Tower from several bank chains. Walking distance to Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square is a nice perk.Beijing is a nice city, but not my favorite. If I come back, though, I will certainly stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel We thought this hotel was great - a modern, well run 4 star hotel, as advertised. We stayed there with our 2 year old - our only complaint was that they tried to charge extra for bedding for our 2 year old, which we are finding if often done in Asia, but we haven't encountered this in other regions. We used a great driver, John, to take us to the great wall at Mutiyani (800 rmb for the day, including a trip to a temple and a drive by the Olympic stadium). He came recommended via a friend, who got the original recommendation from tripadvisor. HIs email is [-] He also recommended a great guide who showed us around Beijing (350 rmb for a day). She is young, but amazingly knowledgable - a University student majoring in French and English who is also a trained guide.We upgraded to the Executive Floor, which included an extensive buffet breakfast -and drinks and a small range of snacks in the evening. Don't go to the Executive floor for the breakfast as the choices are limited, go to the restaurant which is also included in the upgrade price. The upgrade did not get a bigger or better room - to upgrade to a 'suite' was approx 460 rmb (plus 15% tax)per night. The upgrade to the was 235 plus tax. If you don't want a full breakfast, I wouldn't bother and go to starbucks accross the way.

<Content>Service is excellent This is a really nice hotel, with nice decor and great staff. We were only here for 3 nights on a stop-over but felt wonderfully relaxed after staying here. The staff are great, really friendly, and willing to do anything to help. A special commendation goes to the concierge who managed to sort us out at 1130pm with a chauffeur driven car for a couple of days for sight-seeing at a comparable rate to the tourist bus. The car was so much better.The hotel was really good value. If I go back to Beijing I'd stay here.

<Content>Great Location in the middle of the city! I stayed here with a slew of MBA classmates in March to visit companies in Beijing. The hotel is very nice and the breakfast buffet was above average. The staff was very helpful and there was generally at least one English speaking person available. The conference room was a little small, but then again there was apx. 80 of us. Lounge downstairs has a full bar  is a very convenient place to get a drink before heading out for dinner in the evenings. Location is great. And if you need a Starbucks fix, it's just outside next door. I also walked to the Wangfujing market one night which is very close by  an experience. You can even walk to Tienanmen Square.The concierge was okay. They're good at setting up tours to all the major cultural sites and the most popular nightlife venues. But they seemed to be limited to exactly that...so, if you're looking for the inside track on the up  coming art scene or authentic restaurants where not a word of English is spoken, it could be tough. Though they do seem to know these places, it's just not in their regular repertoire to recommend them. Lucky for me, my friend spoke fluent Mandarin, lived for a time in Beijing  still had friends there which proved invaluable. Definitely take the hotel card that has their location on it. You will find that many cab drivers do not speak English and some also don't know the city that well b/c even they are newcomers.

<Content>Great Hotel! PRICE: My parents and I spent 5 nights at the Park Plaza in April 2008. We called the hotel directly and booked the following room: 2 Twin Beds, Rollaway Bed, Non Smoking, Deluxe Room, Bed  Breakfast Package for 1,270 per night ($181 US). An extremely great rate for such an upscale hotel with a phenomenal location and breakfast buffet. STAFF: The staff spoke English very well and were extremely helpful. The hotel provides these little cards with the major sites written in Chinese for you to give the cab drivers, since most do not speak English. ROOM: The hotel rooms are fabulous: air-conditioning is great, tons of hot water in the shower, complimentary bottled water is provided by the cleaning staff each day, linens are great, everything is really nice. AREA: There's a Starbucks and ATM across the driveway, and several restaurants and convenience stores steps away. The Dongdan metro stop is a couple blocks away... but blocks in Beijing are huge. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Lousy front desk service... I stayed with a friend, who was on biz trip, for 2 nites, 21-23 April.She booked directly through the hotel, requesting for a twin bed.However, when we arrived, we were shocked that the front desk staff told us that the booking was not confirmed hence there's no room for us. The hotel expected us to contact them before we arrived to confirm the booking, when they have already accepted our booking with credit card details. Meaning, by not calling them = non-confirmation. This is a great shock to us as being frequent travellers, we have never experience such regulations.So, after dragging for half an hour, they finally found us a suitable room, meaning a queen bed plus a sofa bed! Apparently that's the only solution they can offer! We accepted reluctantly since we were both tired.On our check-out day, we realised another western guest had the same experience as us. Hence, I do not think ours is an isolated case. And we certainly do not expect this from such a well-received hotel.Plus, I think there are nicer, more centrally located hotels around. Like the Regent, Hyatt or Raffles. However, we heard that most of them are booked till Olympics. Good luck!

<Content>nice upgrade this hotel is located near a subway station and walking distance to everything. we arrived late at night and the hotel is fully booked; they gave our room away. To our surprise, they upgraded us to Regent, which is connected to this hotel. Regent is a nice 5 star hotel.....loved it!

<Content>Loved the Park Plaza We just returned from 4 nights in this great hotel. Our family is two seniors and 2 twenties daughters. The price is right and the restaurants great. We opted for the extra money for the breakfast and cocktails. This was a bargain as well. The breakfast is sumptuous and provides everything you could want for breakfast no matter your country of origin. The cocktail area with a few hors d'oeuvres was also nice and worth the money. We ate at the hotel restaurant two nights and had one lunch in the noodle restaurant--all excellent. The people at the front desk were very nice as were the concierge staff. One man even agreed to have our taxi driver keep in cell contact with him because of the language barrier. The rooms were good size and beautifully decorated. The bathrooms roomy. My husband is an architect and he was very impressed with the interiors. We walked to the Forbidden City a couple of times and Wangfujing Street is near by. If you are homesick there's a Starbucks in the cul-de-sac. If you need to call from the US we found the English to be good and the arrangements to be just as we requested.

<Content>Loved Park Plaza - EXCELLENT SERVICE My girlfriend and I recently returned from our stay at the Park Plaza in Wangfujing. After being seriously disappointed with the conditions of our hotel in Tokyo (Akasaka Yoko), we decided to stay somewhere a bit more expensive. This was the greatest decision we made. The hotel room really made our trip much more enjoyable. The staff can not do enough to help you while you are staying there. They courteously greet you as soon as you come through the doors and really enjoy small talk. When in need of a taxi, they radio one for you and write down the license plate in case of any scams. They also have really convenient cards with popular tourist attractions listed on them to give to the cab driver. Make sure you have the address of the hotel written down on paper before you go! We didn't and cab drivers aren't familiar with the hotel, and don't speak any English! As for the room, it was fabulous. More than enough space, giant bed, nice bathroom, and great room service! The room service was a decent price too. I recommend the western style breakfast. The only complaint I have was that the bar was a little overpriced, but that was okay because we just left the hotel to drink. They also tried to talk us into upgrading our room for $200 which included a free dinner buffet with alcohol included every night. We didnt do this and were happy about our choice because we looked at the buffet, which appeared to be mostly snack foods and cheap alcohol. Food is really cheap outside of the hotel, so this is a waste of money! The room also had no view, which we didn't come to China for.STAY AT THIS HOTEL. IT IS GREAT!

<Content>Good hotel and great location We were impressed by the entrance and lobby area. All the public areas are well maintained. The reception dealt with us quickly and efficiently. The bedroom was clean, quiet and with modern furnishings. The linen is good quality. The bathroom was also a good size in good condition and clean. Towels are good quality. We had all that we needed. Bathrobes and sandals are provided. The TV was a large LCD with a large selection of english channels including CNN, BBC world, HBO, Discovery and National Geographic. The bed was confortable.The location is very good and is in walking distance of shops and restaurants.The bar provides live entertainment, although chinese renditions of western songs may not be your cup of tea - you judge.The buffet breakast is a good mixture of chinese, continental and western full cooked breakfast foods. The service is good.

<Content>Amazing Service We have traveled all over the world and the service at Park Plaza Wangfujing exceeds all others. From the gentlemen at the door and the bell desk to the front desk and the wait staff in the fantastic restaurant Bloo Dining the service was by far the best we have ever experienced. Every need was met in a flash and the hotel was planned with so much detail. Friendly and responsive are the two words that best describe the staff. You can exchange currency at the front desk and electric converters are available from housekeeping. Stay here, you will not be disappointed!

<Content>Incredible Hotel, Perfect Location We stayed at the Park Plaza March 18-March 23rd. This hotel absolutely met and exceeded our expectations. We picked this hotel due to the numerous and wonderful reviews on Trip Advisor. There were three of us and we stayed in a suite with a separate bedroom and living room. The living room had an attached bathroom which came in handy for the 3rd guest. We had access to the executive floor which came in handy at the end of a long and exhausting day touring and shopping. The staff was wonderful, knowledgable and spoke very good english. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and had numerous choices including a made to order egg bar. We only had one complaint and that was the climate control system. We had seen this same complaint from other guests. We just compensated by opening the window. As far as location is concerned, this hotel has a great location. it is about a 15 minute walk to Tianmen Square and the Forbidden CIty. We found numerous restaurants within walking distance. They were very good and not expensive. Many of the people who have written about this hotel have said that there is a Starbucks across the way - even better, there is an ATM machine in the office building outside the door. We found one thing with the hotel, however and that is a majority of the taxi drivers dont know where this hotel is. You MUST ask the hotel to e-mail you their name and address in Mandarin. We also found that once we were returning to the hotel, the taxi drivers would not take us because they didnt know where the hotel is located. Since the Park Plaza is right behind the Regent, i would suggest walking over there and asking them for their card - i would definately stay at this hotel again and recommend it to anyone - it was great

<Content>Definitely worth a return visit! I spent 6 nights here based on other reviews here and wasn鈥檛 disappointed. I booked via the hotel website to obtain the suite upgrade offer and was given a room on the upper floors. This also gave me free internet access and use of the Club floor facilities (mini breakfast and early evening snacks and Happy Hour!)My check in was slightly marred as the room wasn鈥檛 ready 鈥揳 surprise as it was 2pm but I was offered hospitality in the Club floor area whilst I waited. The suite was great, spacious and as other people have commented 鈥?clean. The only challenge was working out how to use the room thermostat and I had that cracked by the 3rd day!The breakfast is typical buffet style with some Chinese options as well as western style standard fare. The restaurant, called Bloo, in on the 2nd floor and surprised me slightly by having a smoking section, but this has a separate set of tables. All the staff were pleasant and spoke enough English to get by.I found the concierge and doorman both to be more than helpful and as other reviewers have commented, a very good reflection of the hotel hospitality.Lastly, the location is great for access to Wangfujing Street and the Forbidden City. There is also a subway just around the corner which is very cheap a good way to get around if you want to avoid taxis.All in all this was a great experience and I am happy to recommend it for other travellers.

<Content>Park Plaza Beijing Rocks! I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. Everything about the place is awesome. The lobby and grounds (much of the latter being shared with the Regent) are beautiful, and the front-desk staff was prompt and courteous. The rooms were well decorated and spacious with good-sized bathrooms. The bell desk guys were so helpful. For example, I needed help with a local SIM card, and one of the staff walked several blocks with me to the nearest China Mobile office and stayed with me until my issue was resolved. Incredible service from everyone! I would, however, like to specifically acknowledge the exceptional service provided by Nick at the front desk and Betty in the Club Lounge. These two employees are valuable assets to the hotel. They provided friendly and professional service above and beyond what I expected in every respect. Indeed, Betty and Nick made me feel at home during my four-day stay. No complaints about anything!

<Content>Very Pleasant Stay at Beijing Park Plaza Following the trip advisor rankings of hotels in Beijing and trying to stick to a budget, we decided to book our 7 day stay at the Beijing Park Plaza - Wanfujing. We were not only pleased with the staff and the service at the hotel, but the location was also excellent... only a few blocks away from one of the most popular shopping  restuaruant areas in the city -- Wangfujing Street.ServiceThe check-in and check-out process was flawless. The concierge was very helpful. He gave us directions around town, helped us book a day trip to the Ming Tumbs and the Great Wall, and promptly got us taxis whenever we needed them. On-Site RestaurantOur rate included breakfast, which had a good mix of eastern and western foods. The staff seemed to be a bit moody at times, but after realizing they worked shifts from 6 am to past 10 am, we understood why!!! (We had the same waiters for breakfast as we did for dinner)RoomThe room was clean and had a good view. The bed was a bit hard, but this doesn't seem to be uncommon in China. Everytime we called housekeeping for anything, they would have someone come to our room in less than 5 minutes... which we thought was outstanding! The day before we were supposed to leave the hotel, we were sent a complimentary tray consisting of fresh fruit and a bottle of wine - a nice touch and a great way to end our trip.

<Content>Love this hotel! This hotel is wonderful and I can't fault it. It was a haven in a very polluted city full of people trying to squeeze every last yuan out of you.1. Rooms - We had a twin room. It was spacious, spotless, very comfortable and modern. Suits people on business as there's a large desk.2. Staff - All very friendly and efficient. If you're looking to book a tour, we highly recommend going to the concierge desk and asking them to recommend and book something for you. The tour operators will pick up and drop off at the hotel. For any part of the Great Wall, we recommend a guide called Lily who speaks excellent English and is very knowledgeable. Our tour consisted of just Lily, the driver, my sister and I.3. Location - Very central and you are near a hutong, Wangfujing snack street and lots of restaurants, shops and ATMs. I also felt safe in the area.4. Facilities and other - Internet was free when we were there and the breakfast buffet was plentiful and diverse (Japanese, Chinese, Western).

<Content>Good Bet In Beijing I don't see how anyone could complain about this hotel. Firstly, it is an outstanding location within walking distance of great shopping and tourist attractions. It is one street off the main drag so it is quiet. They had a special on their website for a suite and I found the room very nicely appointed, spacious and quiet with comfortable bed, pillows and amenities. The separate shower had instant hot water with lots of pressure. The food was good at the buffet breakfast and the staff spoke english and was very courteous. This may not be the ritz carlton, but you are not paying those prices, if that is what you want, then stay there but for a great overall experience in beijing at a very reasonable price, this is a winner of a place.

<Content>Great hotel The Park Plaza was a wonderful treat! The location was great and close to the metro. The staff was very helpful and spoke English very well. The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the hotel offered many various trips to see the sights in Beijing. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great service and location We stayed here for 4 nights in February.The rooms are very nice, free internet, large bathrooms.The location is great, however since it was freezing while we were there, we took advantage of the taxis. Pretty much $2 total everywhere you go.The concierge is excellent and had great restaurant recommendations. We ate at Da Dong for the Peking duck. Very good. They did send us to one of the acrobatic shows, the one with the kids, and we did not like that. Go to the big named ones.They also set up a great wall tour for us to Metianyu. It was pricey at 800RMB for the 2 of us, but was great. We had Tony as our guide.The breakfast buffet was AWESOME!! That was the best part of our day. It was included in our stay.Getting there, take a cab. its between 75-95 RMB. Make sure you have it written down in chinese, and also I would print out a map because our driver still had some trouble finding it.

<Content>Fabulous hotel with helpful staff We couldn't believe the deal--about $75 a night for a centrally-located and beautiful hotel. Great staff, gorgeous rooms, convenient location, and a Starbucks 30 feet from the entrance. Concierge arranged Italian, Thai, and Chinese restaurant reservations, even booking a private dining room for six when we showed up at 6 PM on Valentine's night! Prices on this will rise, but for us, it was a sweet deal.

<Content>Fabulous We stayed there a while ago but absolutely loved it. Jeff, the concierge was extremely helpful and spoke good English. I can't wait to go back there especially now the subway is finished.If anyone is there or about to go there check out the fabulously decorated toilets on the floor where you have breakfast. Would love to have a photo of how they were decorated. Had one but lost it.

<Content>Nice room We stayed here for 3 nights during first week of Feb 2008 and had a wonderful stay. The room and the king bed was very nice. Being tired walking around Beijing, a firm bed was enough to mend our aching back by the time we got up in the morning. We did not accept an upgrade when checking in. The US$ 30 extra each day for the upgrade had a free breakfast - its not worth it. We used to go a couple of blocks away from the hotel every day to the Taiwan Hotel where they had a great buffet breakfast for just $14 for two. Otherwise the hotel is conveniently located next to the metro stop and a street with many restaurants. The bell desk recomended us to an acrobatic show but did not find it worth it. They must be making a commission on the tkts. They even wanted us to use their services to book a trip to the Great Wall but we got a very nice trip elsewhere at less than half the price. The Hotel lobby is tiny and the front desk is the only thing which is not impressive at all.

<Content>This is a wonderful hotel with friendly staff I recently visited Beijing from Jan 13-22nd with my finance who happens to be Chinese. I decided to book 3 hotels just to keep the week interesting as we were only going to stay in Beijing. We spent a bit more time IN the hotels than sightseeing as it was VERY cold in Beijing the week we were there. Anyway for me especially, I loved the Park Plaza hotel. When we first checked in a friendly staff member tried to get us to upgrade to a suite from the deluxe room we already booked. Though the suite sounded good...included the Breakfast buffet plus a free 2 hour happy hour I still declined the offer.Check in was very quick and very friendly. We got to the Deluxe room and immediately I noticed it was VERY clean, smelled clean..and was rather modern. However after a few hours I felt the Deluxe room was just a bit small. (The other 2 hotels we stayed at also offered rather small rooms..so maybe this is just the way it is in Beijing, say vs a hotel in NY) We contacted the front desk later that day and asked to be upgraded to the suite the next day. When we finally moved to the suite...it was in a quiet corner of the hotel I felt wow..this feels like home. So the next 2 days we stayed in the suite..and it was just wonderful. Modern electronic thermostats in 2 rooms, 2 bathrooms, 2 tvs etc. All this for about $40 more a day..but you get free breakfast and the happy hour. If you like to drink (I don't) you can get as much Johnny Walker Black or Chivas as you can handle plus some finger type foods. I only mention this because I happen to be a wine/liquor salesman and Johnny Black is NOT cheap. So if you like to eat..and drink a little, the upgrade more or less pays for itself. The Breakfast buffet we felt was pretty good...and I felt everything was rather tasty and fresh overall.Basically I was most impressed with the cleanliness and overall FEELING of being VERY at home rather than in some cold strange hotel. There was just a good vibe about the Park Plaza I did not at all feel about the other 2 hotels we stayed at very nearby. I think for the money..the Park Plaza is a VERY nice friendly place to stay. When I got home to NY I was asked to fill out a survey that the P Plaza asked if I would do for them.. I gave it good grades..and shortly thereafter received a personal letter of thanks from the hotel manager..they seem to genuinely want to please. Overall I think most people would have a nice stay here...if you can afford it, the Suite to me was a big plus!!

<Content>Wonderful place to stay Park Plaza is a nice place to stay after a long day of walking. The rooms are modern with enough closet and drawers for all your clothes. They replenish 2 complimentary water bottles everyday as well. It is conveniently located right next to the new subway station. So if your serious about shopping in the Silk Market, you can easily get there without the hassle of getting caught in traffic. The breakfast though is not that great, it's just ok. I think having bfast there once is enough. The concierge and front desk speaks decent English so you will be able to get directions if needed.

<Content>A Waste of Money. Spend a Bit More and Relish Their Sister Hotel My fiance and I stayed here during our Christmas holidays from Dec 22-28 The reviews of this place had us thrilled and excited, but the only thing we left China with was a polluted taste in our mouths and an assurance if we ever go back to Beijing, PPW's sister hotel, The Regent, will see our business before this -3star establishment ever does again. We booked our reservations online through the goldpointsplus program and were guaranteed the best rate bar none. When we checked in, the desk clerk offered us an upgrade to a junior suite, (which we took), but as we later found out, we were charged for the breakfast upgrade twice. After several complaints the manager offered us a 10$ discount off our total bill, to which we refused. In the end we were offered a free nights' stay, but to this day we are still waiting for the refund we've been promised. We've been told it could take as long as two months for the transaction to process, so I suppose we'll just have to wait and see. The check in girl was nice enough to notice my Christmas Eve birthday and offered us a free birthday cake which was really thoughtful. With our upgrade we had access to the club lounge, but checking in from there took more than TWO hours before our suite was ready and available for us. (We were told there were cleaning issues, lightbulb issues, etc.) The lounge access was a constant issue and we were often denied use of the internet until I became angry enough half way through our stay that it never became an issue again. Having lounge access made us feel more like thieves than privleged guests. The room itself was wonderful and I have zero complaints about it (other than heating issues, but after a day or two, the thermostat was fairly easy to figure out). Our bedroom was spacious with tons of storage and even the plasma screen tv was enjoyable. The bed was a dream to sleep on and the bathroom was clean, spacious, and inviting. I wish I could say the same for service and staff. Our breakfasts at PPW were the one thing I dreaded every single day. Breakfast ran from 6am -10am (seems to end early by 4star standards) and things were rarely (if ever) tended to. Hot dishes were greasy and clearly re-used from the day before, stations were cramped and poorly maintained. We came late and the food was terrible. We came at 6am and the food was equally terrible if not more so. The chef working the egg station showed me obvious and continual contempt when I asked for egg white omelets, cheese was left to dry on plates, and cold cuts looked old and unappetizing.  If you're going to do a buffet in a small space, do it small and do it fabulous, don't fill it with terrible foods poorly prepared and easily forgotten.  The morning of my birthday we came down late for breakfast and were told we couldn't eat any food that was still out from buffet service. When we asked if we could have some of the cold dishes we weren't allowed to do so, even though numerous tables were still eating and helping themselves to the clearly open buffet.   We were forced to order off the menu and our eggs benedict was the worst thing I have ever tried to eat in my life. The eggs were hard boiled and sat on spam and soggy toast, then broiled.   My fiance and I are absolute foodies and this was an absolute travesty. The waitress clearly saw I was upset and refused to do anything about it. We politely voiced our complaints to the manager, and the first thing he tried to do was quiet us with the fact that a birthday cake was due to arrive in our room. He also told us he'd refund our breakfast, but we never heard back from him and the refund never did come. Room service food was mediocre at best, and the infamous birthday cake was left in our bedroom for FOUR days, despite numerous requests to have it removed. We tried to be subtle at one point and destroyed the cake with our cutlery and smeared the plates to make it look like we'd eaten the thing (which we did not). The cleaning staff actually replaced our cutlery and plates but wouldn't remove the cake! It took three separate phone calls to housekeeping, room service, and finally the front desk, to get the offending dishes removed. Christmas Eve was spent at PPW's sister hotel The Regent. Let me say it right now...pay the money and stay in luxury! The hotel is in much better condition (PPW's lobby is dated, dark, and dank, just like their in house restaurants). The Regent staff have smiles on their faces and look to truly enjoy their jobs. They are helpful, the atmosphere is one hundred times better than anything PPW had to offer, and their Christmas Eve seafood buffet was a dream worth waking up for! We even won two prizes that night and were lucky enough to come back for a FREE Christmas Day lunch buffet and high tea in the lounge area. I could go on and on about more, but judge for yourself I suppose. I was thrilled by the reviews posted here and all my fiance and I experienced were disappointment after disappointment.  Bottom line? The room's at PPW are up to par but everything else (staff, surroundings, service, food) are WAY below a 4star rating. Again, pay the extra 10 or 20 dollars and upgrade yourself into a real hotel.

<Author>GroupChinaTrip
<Content>We recommend this Hotel - Detailed Review Summary: Excellent choice, great location, hotel/rooms/facilities  staff are excellent. My friends and i all recommend.General InfoA group of about 10 of us stayed in this hotel over the 2007/2008 New year period. Between us we shared the superior rooms and one deluxe suite which included buffet breakfasts for 2 for 2 days, and free happy hour drinks+finger foods again for 2 for 2 days. I should warn you that although there were 4 of us in the deluxe suite, you are not permitted for all 4 to go at once. You must use 2 coupons in 1 day, and the other 2 the next day. The reasoning behind this is beyond me personally.LocationWangfujing is considered one of, or the most high class/expensive areas in Beijing. By staying in this hotel, and location, you can expect a very clean environment and very spacious paths. Despite a population of something like 15million you would barely believe it when you walk around this area. There is just so much space that overcrowding is not an issue at all. It is a close walk (10-15min) to the shopping area and food markets where if you're daring you can try things like scorpions, starfish and centipedes. You also feel extremely safe in this area. Located directly in front of the hotel is a starbucks, ferrari, Lamborghini and Roll's Royce outlets if that is an indication of the type of location you will be staying at. While walking to the shops you will also pass Novotel hotel and i think it was Regeant. Many restaurants are also along that road as you walk. For the price you pay i think this hotel is a bargain. In terms of getting to other tourist attractions from this hotel there were no issues, it is quite central to everything. Taxi's are cheap and we had no complaints about taxi fares because everything was quite close.Rooms/FacilitiesNo complaints, rooms look modern, clean and beds are comfortable. We were all very happy with our rooms. As with all hotels i stayed in in china, you also get free bottles of water everyday. The deluxe suite is very nice i should mention and included a large LCD tv in the living room, sofa bed and a nice study table. The bathroom is shared and is very big. The toilet is also in its own you could say cubicle and quite far so you don't have to worry about brushing your teeth and holding your breath because someone just did a dump.StaffVery friendly, i must admit due to some complications and the fact that there were 10 of us staff were under pressure but they acted very professional and kept their cool. They can all speak english quite well.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel My wife and I stayed here for 2 weeks over Christmas and we didn't have one single complaint. The hotel is central - A 10 min walk to Wangfujing and is on top of a subway station which is really handy. The room was fantastic, king size bed, fantastic view and free broadband as well. The staff in this hotel should be cloned and sent to every other hotel - Never was a request a problem, they were genuinely happy and always greeted us. Breakfast was amazing and so was their Christmas buffet. We also took advantage of the happy hour offer and was real value for money. I will definitely stay at this hotel again if we are in Beijing.

<Content>The Best !!!!!!!!!!!! I book this hotel online after reading some of the reviews on this site and we were certainly not disappointed. We stayed at the hotel for 8 nights over Dec/Jan 2008. Upon checking in we were given the opportunity to add daily breakfast for two, a room upgrade and happy hour in one of the bars daily for an extra 280RMB (approx A$45 per day), which we decided to take up. The room that we had was a magnificent suite with a seperate lounge and desk with TV, seperate bedroom and large bathroom. It was just beautiful.We had a problem with the airconditioning/heating on the second day of our trip and when we spoke with the reception they moved us to another room immediately. The staff at the hotel were always extremely helpful, nothing was too much of a problem and most staff spoke very good english.The concierge desk was also the best we came across in our travels of china, always willing to help with directions, taxis ( writing down the plate number in case you had a problem), restaurant recommendations etc etc I can not express just how helpful this was travelling independantly in a country where very little english is spoken. The gym in the hotel is fairly small with a couple of treadmills and some other equiptment, although there was rarely anyone else using the facilities. Breakfast buffet was amazing, a few morning it was very busy but they had a huge range of western and chinese cuisine. The bar on the 15th floor in which was part of the upgrade package provided free drinks from 5.30pm til 7pm offering a range of wine. beer, soft drinks and even spirits (johnny walker black, gin, campari, barcardi etc etc) and both hot and cold nibbles.The hotel also offered free internet in the business centre, which was great. The location of the hotel was great, a short walk to the shopping malls, forbidden city etc Taxis were always about and there are many restaurants and even a starbucks within 50m if you don't feel like going too far. I can't rave enough about this hotel, it really made our trip to Beijing magificent !

<Content>Greatly Exceeded Expectations We were delighted with our stay at the Park Plaza and felt that it greatly contributed to the quality of our stay in Beijing. The room was really lovely - all the decor and amenities felt like a 5 star hotel.The staff, especially the concierges, were more than helpful. They not only gave us excellent advice but offered to obtain our train tickets from the station (saving us the hassle) and did not charge for the service -- only for the cab fare. We were also delighted with the door service - helping us into cabs and giving directions to the driver as our Chinese is quite elementary. Also they made wonderful suggestions. But best of all we noted the cheery greetings from all staff in the morning and when we returned or just passing in the lobby. Although other hotels gave similar service, none compared with the desire to please attitude of the staff. We felt this not only reflected the excellent hiring skills but also the training of the staff.

<Content>Christmas Magic at the Park Plaza Staying at the Park Plaza hotel was a great experience. Hotel is abouta 20 min walk to Tianammen and Forbidden City. 10 min walk to Snack Street and main shopping area. The concierge were very helpful in booking city restaurants and also in ensuring that your taxi driver knew exactly where he was going before setting off. The hotel providedhelpful translations of all the main tourist destinations so if you got lost you could idiotically point at the card and magic your way to where you wanted to go.We had a lovely view over a hutong. Housekeeping was fantastic, the place was spotless and a very nice touch.....on Christmas Eve a little parcel of cookies and chocolates was left in our room. Staff very friendly. This was the first hotel westayed in in China and unfortunately for the others, it was the bar to which we measured the others against. Booking direct with the hotelseems to get you the best rates and it was definately great value for money. Would absolutely stay here again. We were very sad to leave thehotel and Beijing, a fantastic city.

<Content>Fantastic I stayed here for five days in December. I got an amazing deal on Expedia for about $65 per day including tax (excluding breakfast though). The hotel is in a great location, close to tourist activities and shopping. It's modern and very pretty inside, but best of all, the service is fantastic. The staff is super helpful and friendly.Overall, this is a great hotel for business and tourists alike. Why pay three times the price at the five star Peninsula (or other hotels) around the corner, when you get the same quality and service at this place. Who knows though how much longer such great deals can be had?

<Content>Park Plaza beijing, absolut top We stayed for 10 days at this excellent hotel. As other reveiwers have mentioned, this is a 5 star+ hotel for a 4 star price. Yes they might miss some special features to get the 5* rating, but none that we missed. We had an fantastic roomy suite, which felt like home and was kept very clean and nice during our entire stay. The staff of the hotel, without exception, was very friendly, helpful and courtious with a special mention for the business lounge staff. The location is also excellent with many tourist attractions within easy reach. Great value and we definite recommend this hotel to travellers to Beijing.

<Content>Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing was our oasis of comfort in Beijing Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing was wonderful. My husband and I stayed for 5 nights in late November. The service by the staff was excellent across the board. The room was spacious and the bedding comfortable. There is a lovely lobby with a comfortable lounge to sit and relax and have a drink after a day in Beijing's pollution and crowds. The concierge (there were a few in the days we were there) were all helpful to us in figuring out how to get from A to B. We were very pleased with our stay and would go back if we were to ever go to Beijing again.

<Content>perfect location Stayed for 5 nights in early December with my family - 2 non-smoking rooms, 1 double and 1 twin, as requested. We weren't able to be given adjoining rooms, but were on the same floor.Rooms are great - quite sleek, and everything looks new, the bathrooms are also nicely done. No smell of smoke at all, was definitely a non-smoking room.Location was fantastic - in a downtown area near Wangfujing street. I agree with previous reviewer - most taxi drivers don't know where it is, unless you know the Chinese name for the hotel. (saying it is next to the Regent can help though).The breakfast buffet was fine, although some of the breakfast staff were a bit slow to serve tea/coffee etc.The doormen were very helpful - once we were heading out to meet a friend, but didn't quite have the right address written down in Chinese. They immediately offered to ring my friend on her mobile  found out the correct address, then made sure the taxi knew where we were going.Recommend a restaurant called Xiao Nan Guo which is in the JinMao tower opposite (can't remember if it was on the 2nd or 3rd floor) - very sleek interior (all black), great service (best we had in Beijing), food was fantastic, and very very reasonably priced. Definitely recommend this hotel!

<Content>Loved the location Hotel was a little difficult to find; would recommend that you download the hotel name and address in Chinese characters to show your driver.Booked a superior room and was upgraded to a deluxe room upon check in. Rooms are new, clean and internet access is free.Its walking distance to Wangfujing shopping area and forbidden city. Eating places are also accessible and more importantly they cater to non-chinese readers like myself with pictorial menus.Overall a great hotel to stay in - superb value for money.

<Content>Be very careful staying here--promises get broken The four of us stayed at the Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing in November, from the 12th to the 16th, four nights. I paid for both rooms. I cannot stress how crucial it was to have non-smoking rooms, so instead of simply booking through the website where one room didn't allow me to choose smoking or non-smoking, I decided to call Carlson directly via the toll free number on their site. Things went down hill from there...Pros: Rooms were spotless, housekeeping was very thorough. Spacious rooms meant room to relax and have our local friends over for evening coffee in our suite. Walls were a little thin, but the comfy beds meant that we slept well anyway. Porters, bellhops, all wonderful. Breakfast buffet selection excellent, congee to omlettes and lots of variety in-between, very good quality. Service at restaurant also good, although the coffee was weak. Since there was a Starbucks accross the way, we just bought ground coffee and made nice strong coffee in our rooms using the coffee pot provided. Concierge arranged taxi service for us to the Great Wall, which was very reasonable at 700 RMB. Decor at the hotel was relatively modern and comfortable, muted earth tones throughout. The staff all spoke passable English, even though two of us, myself included, were fluent in Mandarin. If not for the front desk staff, I'd be a convert: near-St. Regis quality at better than half the price.Cons: After a year, I really would have expected this hotel to have worked through its growing pains. The US reservations call centre thoroughly screwed up our reservations that were so critical to us, so after a few calls to Corporate Customer Service, one free night (of the eight I was paying for) was offered. This was compensation for my hours and hours of calling both US and Chinese Carlson offices/locations trying to get this resolved.I was reassured twice by staff --at the local hotel-- that this was all taken care of, however upon check out I was told by the morning staff that they knew nothing about the issue, feigning ignorance. They conferred some more, all the while not realizing that I understood all that was being said (I am caucasian). Not fun. Finally, one particular representative, and I'm quoting here, concluded: This was the US call centre's problem, and they never contacted us. Since it's not a local problem, we are not going to honor this promise. We are separate and the US can't control us. We are not giving you one night free. I realize that Beijing is 12h behind the US call centre, but basically what happened here is that no one in China was willing to get the job done, to confer and make arrangements behind the scenes.The US can't control us!? What's that all about? This hotel chain made a promise that they broke. They gladly accept reservations arranged courtesy of the call centre, but when things went awry, they decided that they were a separate entity, when it was convenient... We had a flight to catch, travelling on to Hong Kong, so I was stuck, I had to pay.Be very careful--these people don't keep their promises. The assistant manager has also since informed me that they still aren't going to honor the request, and that they don't even guarantee non-smoking rooms when requested! This is one of those places where you just might not get what you bargain for, so I'd be very reluctant to recommend staying here, even with all the positives. I'm sure that other American hotel chains in Beijing are much more willing to put their customers first. The front desk staff here needs to go back to charm school.In the end, the US folks are mailing me a cheque for the one free night, but would I stay there ever again? Nope. It's a matter of trust, that when things go wrong, you can count on the people in charge to make things right and fix the problem. Not the case here.

<Content>Excellent service! This a hidden gem of a hotel, tucked away behind a bigger hotel and therefore shielded by the sound of inner city traffic! Excellent service. We arrived in the afternoon and they told us our room wasn't ready so they were upgrading us to a suite for our 4 day stay! Amazing suite on the executive club floor.Just a few wee problems....the air conditioning didn't work very well and the food was a little average. Would not hesitate to stay there again though as the service was excellent and very friendly.

<Content>V Nice Hotel in great location V nice modern hotel near the main shopping street (Wanfujing) and about a 20 minute walk from the Fobidden City.The hotel doesn't make enough of it but the building complex the hotel is part of sits on top of a metro station on the new line 5 (just opened). The line runs north-south and connects with all the other metro lines. There's a flat rate of 2 Yen per trip which is 7.5p!Hotel rooms and reception are very nice. Ther view is not great as all the rooms (I think) overlook an office/restaurant/hotel block which is about 75m away (the other hotel is called The Regent). There's also a Starbuck in this block.The staff are all very nice and friendly but not all have great english. Great value, would definately stay there again but not a waw hotel.

<Content>Excellent hotel I was in charge of the arrangements for a group of 54 people traveling to China in September 2007. Not only was I extremely impressed with the beautiful rooms, facilities, and location, but the service as well, particularly for the price. Our reservation was complicated, not just because we had so many people, but we had several participants who arrived and departed on different dates, needed special airport pickups, etc. I had communicated these needs to the management for the 2 months leading up to the trip, but was still worried about potential problems given the complexities of our visit. I'm pleased to say that all went off without a hitch! The manager of the hotel was amazing. He was waiting for me when our group arrived, and gave me his cell phone number in case I needed to contact him at any time. I felt the hotel management and staff truly wanted our business and were happy to assist us in any way possible. I would stay here again without question!

<Content>Excellent Hotel at a Great Location The four-star rating is a result of the hotel not having frills such as a swimming pool or a fancy restaurant. The guestroom we had was beautifully furnished, new, clean, and modern. The service is also first rate. With many international hotels nearby, a major shopping area within walking distance, and the new No. 5 subway line 20 metres away from the hotel's back entrance, one can't ask for more in terms of location. The only drawback was the in-room thermostat insisting on setting itself at 25 degrees celsius, regardless of what we tried to set it at. Overall, a very nice hotel that I wouldn't hesistate in recommending to friends.

<Content>i luuuuuuuved it! park plaza is an absolute MUST! i could not say enough about this place- very friendly and helpful staff (front desk, concierge, maid service- everyone was eager to help us), great food for reasonable price (main restaurant has a variety of food. also, try the noodle place. it's great!), clean and spacious room/bathroom, and excellent location! i've been to many 4 and 5 star hotels, but this 3-star rated hotel (i'm not even sure why this has only 3 stars- it far exceeds the quality of a 3-star; i must say, the only thing that is similar to other 3-stars is the price =)) was actually a lot better than an average 4-star hotel in europe. there is no doubt- i will definitely go back to park plaza in beijing!

<Content>comfortable hotel near all Prompted by the long list of favorable reviews we booked a five night stay at this newer hotel near the tourist sites of Beijing. Located on a quiet side street, tucked in behind the Regent hotel, our taxi driver from the airport had a difficult time finding it. On the other hand, our sixth floor room looked out onto a hutong, and we could observe from above the life on the street of one of these fast disappearing old neighborhoods. Pedestrianized Wanfujing Street, the major shopping street of Beijing, is but a couple of blocks away and reached in a short walk.Check-in was accomplished by friendly, efficient staff, who along with the bell captain never tired to assist us with information during our stay. On setting out for a day of sightseeing, they would write our destination in Chinese onto a business card of the hotel to show the taxi driver, who as a norm spoke no English.Our room was comfortably furnished with a king size bed with a great mattress, nice linens and pillows, desk, flat screen TV, phone, broadband Internet access, mini-bar, coffee and tea maker with supplies, and the closet held everything from shoe horn over cloth bush to ironing board and iron. The very nice bathroom with terrazzo counter top, modern bowl shaped porcelain sink, tub/shower, came with very soft towels, cotton robes, and an ample supply of toiletries. Minor nuisances were a very slow draining sink from which at times emanated an odor, noisily slapping doors in neighboring rooms, alarm clocks and wake-up call rings audible through thin walls, and not restocking the mini-bar for two days. Laundry service turn-around was prompt and within the time frame promised.Liberal use of light colored wood to line walls enhanced lobby, restaurant, bar, hallways and elevators. Breakfast was served buffet style in the second floor restaurant and offered something for everyone. An omelet cook stood by as well. Dinner was served a la carte or buffet style.The western style entr茅es were okay, though not exactly fine dining. For that one can go next door to Daccapo in the Regent hotel for some delicious Italian food, prepared by the Swiss chef. Lovers of French food will not be disappointed at Justine, a short taxi ride away. The lobby bar/lounge offered entertainment some nights. A lobby shop and a business center, albeit expensive, round out the public area of the hotel.In summary, we were thoroughly happy with our stay at this newer hotel, which provided a comfortable base from which to venture out to explore the sights in and near Beijing. It deserves its four star rating. Should we return to Beijing, we will definitely stay here again.

<Content>One of the best! We stayed a week and LOVED this hotel!!! Clean and spacious rooms. Staff bent over backwards to be friendly and accommodating.Everything was 5 star. Concierge was a great help! Food in restaurantwas good, especially breakfast, and we normally closed down the restaurant with snacks and drinks late at night. They even boxed up our lunch for the trip to the Great Wall.Oh, and there's a great restaurant across the street where you order a pot of broth, it comes to your table on a hotplate  you add your favorite ingredients...yum...not sure the name. There's a Starbuck's right there, too, and a Bank of China around the corner. Couldn't askfor more. Close enough to all the attractions without too many crowdson the street. (Out of the way, but in a GOOD way). For a couple bucks, you can get a metered cab anywhere!!! (Be careful downtown...we almost got suckered into an expensive ride late at night...only use the METERED cabs.)We walked from Park Plaza to Tienanmen Square one morning at sunrise,but I wouldn't recommend it for most people...we are walkers and we got winded! Better to take a cab or even cab to the subway. It was quite a hike...Even the staff looked at us like we were a bit crazy when we said we'd walk. The maps are deceiving! I would highly recommend Park Plaza. We will stay again without a doubt!!!

<Content>Very Pleasant Stay I had a very pleasant experience at this hotel during a six-day stay in late October 2007. Staff were friendly and helpful, location is superb with a new subway stop tucked around the corner (and not yet on most tourist maps). Very clean room, lots of thick towels, high-pressure shower nozzle, elegant bathroom decor, comfortable bed, complimentary broadband connection, bargain price. Most definitely would stay here again.

<Content>Terrible experience Given the extremely laudatory comments, I must have been quite unlucky.I arrived in the room at 10 pm: nice room, but when I tried to connect to Internet, I discovered that the plug was broken. It took 3 hours to have it repaired.Then I went to bed but the room was next to the elevator, terribly noisy, I slept 3 hours. At 6 am I discovered that rain was pouring in the room thru the window. I called and was told I would be immediately transferred to another room, which was the case 5 hours later.The new room got cold in the afternoon: I called and was told that indeed heating was not any more woirking but that it would be repaired asap. Three days later, it has not been, in spite of my repeated requests. But they were kind enough to bring a tiny heating device: I am still freezing, but at least it works !!I will be delighted to leave to-morrow.My conclusion and advices:- I must have been quite unlucky, in many other aspects the hotel is pleasant- there is obviously problems of maintenance- be sure to have goos sweaters etc.. in case of heating problems- do not come if possible for business purpose: any problem will take hours of your previous time to be solved- do not use the expensive business center: one photocopy will cost you 1.5 US $, so 30 $ for a memo of 20 pages.Good luck!!!

<Content>Good Location, Friendly Hotel We spent a few nights here at different ends of our Mongolian travels. We were upgraded to a business room on one stay and got the best slippers of our entire 51 day trip!The hotel is friendly, in a great location and walking distance to the Hutongs, shopping and night food market. It had fee broadband internet and good size rooms. We left really early one morning and the hotel arranged a packed breakfast for us and took into account our dietary requirements.We stored our luggage at the hotel when we went to Xian and there were no problems. Overall a great hotel - felt like home from home by the time we left. Comfy beds (unusual for the region) and good service.We were lucky enough to be upgraded to the sister hotel for one night (next door) The Regent and were spoilt by the Regent Breakfast buffet, but never went hungry.

<Content>Loved the Plaza Wangfujing WOW! I consider myself a hotel snob and I can't tell you how many hotels I reviewed, looked up, checked with travel agents and read every reveiw I could find on each of them....WELL, we did it right. Our stay was Oct. 1-7, 2007. WITH THE NATIONAL HOLIDAY, THE ENTIRE TOWN WAS PACKED. THAT IS THE ONLY THING I WOULD CHANGE! Try to avoid that holiday.Our hotel was wonderful. It was four star plus as USA standards go. I was afraid that it would be less than was shown or stated but I was pleased right from the moment we pulled up to the front door. It is located right behind the Regent Hotel and is owned by the Regent. First, the location was perfect. It was close to everything and walking distance to many attractions including Wangfujing Street and the night market. But don't make location everything because taxi rides are dirt cheap in Beijing.The Lobby is very modern, the hotel is just a few years old and the staff spoke good english. They made wonderful suggestions and were always willing to direct the cab drivers, write the name of your hotel for our return back. The front desk cashed travelers checks with no problem, except once when they ran out of Chinese currency and told us we needed to return about 2 hours later. The exchange rate is the same for cash and travelers checks. Our room was beautiful. The bed was comfortable and pillows were soft. Everything was spotless. The bathroom was large, modern with marble everything, the tub large and new, water pressure great and perfect flushing toilets. They had all the modern aminities and the toothbrushes they give you are first rate just in case you forget yours. We got our room on the higher floors, but I would not pay the extra as I saw a room on the lower floor that cost much less then ours and was the exact same. We did get the breakfast plan and it was quite nice and held us most of the day. It was buffet with all the trimmings including dim sum which I love.I did call for room service a couple of times and the service fast, food hot and the steak fries were the best I have had anywhere. They are quick to respond to any requests. I did tip the bellman and I think they are now starting to expect it even though they don't ask or make any gestures. Just a few $$ really goes a long way.I would recommend this hotel to anyone. MAKE SURE BEFORE YOU GO THAT YOU HAVE THE HOTEL SEND YOU THE ADDRESS IN CHINESE BECAUSE IT IS SO NEW..... If you want more bling in the lobby, stay at the Regent, but I am sure you will pay more. Again, service great, room outstanding, food better then most in Beijing, and the hotel also gives you free bottled water every day for your trip around the city. Last thing, if you are not on a organized tour, YOU MUST HIRE A GUIDE! That was one of the best things we did. It is really inexpensive and since the taxi drivers don't speak any english, you need one especially if you want to see the city. My best shopping was a the Silk Market.I would be happy to answer any questions about the hotel or city, shopping as I wish I had someone to answer mine before I went.Have a wonderful time!pjdaut@aol.com

<Content>A Great Base in Beijing For the life of me I can't understand what people are griping about with this hotel. The room was great, the location is excellent and the food was good too. You can walk to the forbidden city, the night food market and Wangfujing shopping street, and Tiannamen from here. The staff is very friendly and they will only put you in honest, licensed cabs with a map back to the hotel to give the return driver. The concierge can arrange just about anything you need. Next time we are in Beijing we will plan to spend the entire time in the Park Plaza.I will say a few things that could be improved on,1) The buffett is expensive, especially the breakfast and especially for China. However, The food is fairly good and it managed to keep me happy.2) They need to add at least one person to each shift that speaks english fluently. The staff speaks passable English but if you want something out of the ordinary(Like a glass of ice for your bottled water) they have trouble with that.3) More rooms so that I can get one on short notice.All in all a great hotel and a great experience, I definitely give this hotel my stamp of approval.

<Content>great location, very good hotel We got a very good deal on this hotel, and after the positive reviews we read on tripadvisor we decided to stay there. We were not disappointed. It is an excellent location, to where you can walk to the Forbidden City. In and of itself that was great.The central location also lends itself to cheap taxis for other sites. The rooms were a good size, and very clean. I would not say they have 4 star appointments by any means - more like 3 to 3.5 star style rooms. Free high speed internet was very nice. The food was decent - mostly western food and japanese it seemed. And there is a Starbucks right acroos the driveway, which was nice. The staff were all very helpful with maps and directions. The best thing they helped us with was a driver to take us to the Great Wall for the day. For $100, this made everything really easy for us. We even had enough time to go to the Summer Palace on our way back (the car hire was for 8 hours), as well as stop at a convenience store for snacks and water. The driver they got us was great. One tip - on our way from the airport our driver was very confused as to which hotel it was. There are several hotels of similar names. And just saying it in english or pointing to the name and address in english was not helpful. I would recommend asking someone in the airport who speaks english to write the name and address in chinese on a piece of paper for you. We were lost and finally had to ask people on the street for help.

<Content>The best hotel we stayed at in China We visited China for two weeks staying in Beijing, Xi'an, Hangzhou and Shanghai and we can say that this hotel was above and beyond the rest of the hotels we stayed at (the rest were about the same price). They spoke fluent english, the room and bathroom was clean and very modern. It has good access to Wangfujing street and nearby shopping. It is less than a 30 minute walk to the Forbideen City.

<Content>hotel taxi are overpriced the hotel and rooms are nice and the price for the room is ok. location is not bad but could be better. never had problems with taxis not finding the hotel.The hotel arranged a taxi for a one day trip and they charged me rmb 1000 which seems rather expensive. I booked the room via the hotel webside. while booking the webside stated that the room will be charged within 24 hours but when I checked out, I had to pay again. not sure if I got charged twice.

A must is the Great Wall of China but try to aviod on Chinese public holidays.

<Content>Much more than I expected I trusted the reviews of former travelers in Trip Advisor, and it could never have been better. The hotel has an excellent location, just 10 minutes walk to the Forbidden City  Tiananmen square, and 5 minutes to a pedestrian street packed with shops.I booked the hotel through Expedia, and got a rate of $120 approx. When I arrived, I was given a standard room, so I asked for an upgrade, which was immediately consented. I stayed in suite 1005, on the 10th floor, which was around 45 sq mts divided into a living room with its own toilet and a bedroom, with a huge bathroom. The suite had one TV set in the living room and an LCD in the bedroom.Breakfast was not included in the price, but there was a Starbucks cafe almost next door.Laundry service was very good.

<Content>Good rooms, walking distance to shopping, close to restaurants I stayed here with a tour group recently. I have to echo the other positive reviews. The fitness center is a little smaller than I'd like, but there are treadmills and some weight equipment.I thought at first it was a little far from shopping, but it's still only 5-10 minutes walk to Wangfujing and some good restaurants.The hotel lobby and bar are small and not impressive, but the best part is that the Park Plaza is right next to the Regent (sister hotel?) which has a beautiful lobby and is a nice place to sit for a drink. They also have a better selection of scotch! Several of my friends and I went there and noted the bar prices at the Regent are not much higher than the Park Plaza. It was worth going next door for the better ambiance. Breakfast was good and the selection changed every day. There is a large nonsmoking area. The smoking section was light and airy and is where I chose to sit everyday. It didn't exactly have a view of anything but it was a nice place to sit and the smoke wasn't too bad.Service was generally good, and the bell staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful. I didn't ask them for directions often, but when I talked to them they were glad to give advice.I would definitely stay there again. I will admit, if the Regent weren't right next door I wouldn't enjoy it as much, but it's like having access to the amenities of a 4 star hotel at a 3 star price.

Staff were friendly and approachable and general level of English was very high, Concierge was especially helpful providing us with useful advice and tips for the area. We where lucky enough to get a room upgrade to a beautiful room on the top floor. Location is very close to the forbidden city and other sights, could not really ask for more. The only drawback was the one small bottle of drinking water each a day which was a little annoying however more was very easy to buy from shops nearby.

<Content>Park Plaza Wangfujing The Park Plaza Hotel is a relatively new hotel (less than 2 years old) connected to the Regent Hotel. Food and bar services at both hotels can be charged to your room. Rooms are comfortable and in excellent shape. Staff, and in particular the concierge/doorman group, are excellent. All were able to converse in english and made arranging taxis and trips very easy. The doormen provided a card with your destination in chinese, taxi number, Park Plaza Hotel name in Chinese and a small area map (that facilitated the return trip) each time a taxi was used from the hotel. The hotel desk offered currency conversion for many currencies including usd, cad and aus at better rates than we could get at home. The hotel is within walking distance of the Wangfujing shopping area and within 200 meters of the not yet open Subway line #5. Breakfast buffet featured both Chinese and North American style food including an egg station for fresh eggs/omelettes. Overall an excellent experience and very well valued 4 star hotel.

<Content>coming back great location , we are not backpacker so for the price ($145)we went all the way and got a suite . this hotel is near forb.city/tiananmen (5 min.by taxi) and walking distance to shoppingstreet food. the hotel and the area are very modern and clean.( downstair from the hotel ,you have a ferrari/rollroyce dealer!!!!) we did not try the food at the hotel .all the staff were friendly helpful with all our needs. you have a starbucks near the hotel entrance .(for the homesicks!!).we did not use the subway cuz the taxi are so cheap($1.30 for the 1st 4 kms)so a 30 mins ride will cost you around $4).you have better hotel(grand hyatt) but the price is not the same($300 for a room,not a suite) .you can go there there is a nice restaurantmade in chinathey make a very nice peking duck and is not expensive (crispy duck for 2 pax/ $18). the courtyard resto was great as well,very romantic facing the forb.city. the hotel concierge will help you with the tours for the great wall. for the city tours no need,just take a map and a taxi(so much fun). for the great wall ,i do not recommend badaling is too busy ,but mutianyu' was the best ,not too many personne.you have a cable car to reach the top(or walk!) then after walkin along the wall(1.5 miles down) you can take a different cable car down OR you can slide down the mountain on a tobogan(great) .the private driver(upgraded vehicle) for the day was (8hrs) $95+ tips!! enjoy your trip :)

<Content>Great choice in great area of Beijing I stayed at the Park Plaza for a week in August and really liked the hotel. Having looked at the Park Plaza website, I'm not sure that I would have stayed in any of their other properties but this was a cut above. The rest of my hotels in China were five star and this one could certainly compete with them on almost every level (perhaps the rooms were a bit smaller and there was no pool). The hotel is very new and modern. The rooms are clean and spacious enough for two (though i was only one person in it). The location is great just a block away from the Wangfujing shopping street. It's not far from the Forbidden City but, since distances are so large in Beijing, it makes sense to take cabs anyway (and they're cheap). What really sets this hotel apart from other 4 star properties is the service - which was at a 5 star or above level. From the front desk to the restaurants to the absolutely excellent concierge staff who always put 110% into everything they did (I can't speak highly enough of them). I would call this a 'small 5 star' hotel rather than a 4 star and highly recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Overrated The Park Plaza in Beijing is okay (average at best). While it has decent rooms (clean  new), the service is sub-par when compared to similar hotels in China (for the same price). Its the little things around service ... a meager breakfast buffet (cannot serve cappuccino, canned juice), only one small bottle of mineral water /day, bellboy complaining about a tip to our guide (Tips are not expected in China!) etc.On the plus side, its decently located (close to Wangfujin shopping area, Tiananmen square is a 15-20min cab ride away (there's no subway nearby)  has a very helpful concierge. End of the day, its a fair deal - however doesn't deserve to be #2 on tripadvisor.

<Content>Top Notch A travel buddy and I stayed at this hotel on 2 separate occasions and we loved it. The rooms were great. The staff was excellent. We actually walked back from Tiannamin square to the hotel through the Wangfujing shopping area. The bell hop helped us plan most of the daily travel and had a car reserved for each day we needed him. There is a starbucks across the alley way for the coffee drinkers.

<Content>loved it! It was tucked on a back street but a short walk to the shops. The major sights were a bit farther but also within walking distance. The staff was wonderful! The hotel is new, so the rooms were modern and well appointed with american current in the bathroom for our appliances . I liked the scale of the hotel, not too big. I have stayed in other hotels in Beijing, but so far, this is my favorite. I would return. Also, for what it's worth, they were building a Starbucks right across the walkway from the front door.

<Content>Sleek, Lovely, Fantastic Location Park Plaza We had an absolutely lovely stay at the Park Plaza! Sleek, new, Asian interiors. Fantastic location right off Wangfujing with a serene atmosphere and lovely service. The family with us has stayed at the Peninsula and the other top two hotels in Beijing and said that the rooms at the Park Plaza were bigger and as nice for probably much less than half the price! The only thing missing was the giant, super fancy lobby. However, the lobby at the Park Plaza was lovely as well and had an intimate, calm atmosphere. Easy walk to the night market on Wangfujing Street. Highly recommended! One of our rooms was upgraded to a suite and it was two full rooms with two full baths--very luxe.

<Content>Comfortable stay in hot summertime This hotel is ideal for travelers not interested in complete luxury but in clean comfortable modern accommodations. The rooms were decent sized, the bathrooms were spotless, and the lobby was warm and inviting. The only downside is the expensive Internet station, but overall highly recommend this property.

<Content>An OK hotel, with some significant lapses Its an OK hotel, but lets not get crazy. Some things that bothered me include the following:They do not respect the do not disturb sign, which here is enacted by pushing a button which enables an illuminated sign by the doors entrance.I stayed on the sixth floor, and tended to want to relax in the afternoon, and on three consecutive days:a) cleaning staff knocked on the door, asked if they could come in. I said no. Then 15 minutes later a maintenance guy actually OPENED the doorb) the next two days in a row, they CALLED and asked if it was OK to enter. You see, they did not want to disturb me by knocking and thought it would be OK to --call on the phone--Does this staff receive any training at all?-------The buffet breakfast is OK--not great, but certainly OK. My beef was that the price of the buffet was not shown on the menu or anywhere else. It actually costs more than the American breakfast as served by a waiter--but there was no way for anyone to know this.The poor waiters are not at fault, nor were they prepared to explain this situation,--------The hotel is clean, the staff is nice (despite the above ) and I would stay there again. But I cannot understand the above lapses.

<Author>World_Cup_Wanderer
<Content>Great Place to Stay This hotel proved to be excellent value. The quality of the rooms was good, the staff were friendly and helpful, and there was little to complain about. All the comments and reviews from previous Trip Advisor reports proved to be accurate and set appropriate expectations: the hotel is tucked away behind the Regency Hotel and taxi drivers do struggle to find it, but once you get there the cards provided by the hotel provide good directions in chinese to major attractions and the hotel for outings and that return trip.I need to make special mention of the concierge staff, who were just fabulous. They provided a good language bridge for communication problems, and came up with great solutions for our plans during our week stay at the hotel. They were much more helpful than any other concierges I have dealt with in the past, and they were always careful to make sure we were safe.The lounge staff in the hotel were keen as mustard to please, and tried very hard, but their inexperience in hospitality was obvious, with some memorable moments. One needs to be patient and understanding with the lounge staff - they want to be good and with time and practice, I think they will get there.Overall we were very pleased with the hotel and would not hessitate to stay there again.

<Content>Great hotel in Beijing Booked this through American Express, paid approx $90.I was hesitant and debated between Holiday Inn and the Plaza because many of the reviews I read mentioned problems with communication but I've found the important staff are able to communicate and the concierges are excellent. Both conceirges I've dealt with spoke great english, were very knowledgeable and helpful. Initial problem for taxi's to find the hotel as it is tucked away behind the regent but once you're here the hotel provides a map as well as a business card. The map is great as it shows you key destinations in the area with both english and chinese so you can show taxi drivers etc. The business card has these destinations as well as some other helpful phrases. We got someone in the Airport to phone the hotel to provide us a chinese version of the name and address.From a business travel purspective I was really pleased to see all the plugs are adaptable for multi country so you don't need an adaptor. Something many hotels can learn from. I'd rate the rooms better than most hotels I've stayed at feven or higher rates.The breakfast buffet is good although pricey for Beijing. I would suggest you roam a little and eat in some of the local restaurants.

<Content>Pretty good value I stayed her for 3 weeks in July 2007. Overall a pretty good hotel at a good value. It's not the nicest hotel in Beijing but it's probably the best value. I managed to get it for under $90/night, and that included internet access. It is in a very good location, walking distance to Wangfujing and the Forbidden City. The rooms are 4 star quality. The beds are pretty confortable and the tv offers up quite a few US channels. The bathrooms are nice.On the down side I don't like the following:- no pool- it's hidden behind the Regent hotel and not taxis can find it- in total I've checked into this hotel 5 times and they have screwed up my resevervation (date, price, room) everytime. I have yet to get into my room in under 30 minutes.- the towels are paper thin

<Content>Fantastic Hotel!!! Great hotel in Beijing. Really good location, about 20 minutes walking from Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, and 5 minutes from the main comercial area. The Concierge was really helpful and had really good english. The rooms were new and modern. The breakfast was ok, it was not included and for China it麓s a little pricy, but you have a Starbucks near, so... Would definately come back to this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel! This hotel was great! The price was right especially for the weekend. I found the staff very helpful and accommodating especially the concierge. The rooms are nicely appointed, and although they all pretty much look the same, there is a nice character to them in terms of decorations. The room service is also very good and very prompt. The location is also great, just a few blocks from the Wangfujing shopping street. The only thing that I would advise against is the 2 RMB/Minute internet. Try to find an internet cafe in the area. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Great hotel, loved it We stayed for 6 nights, and booked the hotel based upon the reviews here on tripadviser. It lived up to expectations.Location is great, a 15-20 minute walk from Wangfujing Street, Forbidden City, Tienenmann Square. Staff was very friendly and helpful, arranging trips for us, writing directions in Chinese for the taxi drivers, mailing our postcards.Even with Chinese directions, many taxi drivers had a hard time finding the hotel. It is tucked away off the main street behind Jinbao Tower. Coming in from the airport was a challenge since we ourselves could not help the driver, however once we knew where it was we were able to gesture to show the driver where to go once we approached the road it was on.The room was very comfortable and everything worked perfectly. A/C worked great. The complimentary in-room broadband internet access worked without problem, though it was a little slower than I expected.Morning breakfast buffett was awesome, with a tremendous selection of American and Asian food. It was a little expensive compared to the cost of the room, but that I think is a minor complaint.All in all, we had a very good experience at this hotel and will definitely stay again.

Everything is very westernized, and everyone can speak English,which made my boyfriend (non-chinese speaker) feel very comfortable. We will definitely stay there again whenever we go to Beijing again!

<Content>Internet expensive and Concierges don't know the city well enough The hotel regarding location, dining, room etc... is fantastic only 2 slight negatives after our stay of a week to look out for:1. INTERNET: If you don't have your computer and use the internet in the hotel's business centre it is very expensive at RMB2 a MINUTE. Cheaper to take walk 10min or take a taxi (RMB10) to an internet cafe nearby which costs RMB2 an HOUR. The internet places are open all night, have about 100 computers, all computers have headsets and microphones if you want to Skype someone and they even sell icecreams at RMB10 each (EUR0.10)!2. CONCIERGES: The various concierges at the hotel can sometimes not write down precise enough instructions for the taxi drivers which can leave you stuck at the requested location's nearby bus station instead of the requested shopping mall and they don't seem to know enough about Beijing. When we asked about a visit to the underground tunnels, the nearest supermarket etc... the concierges admitted they just didn't know or they advised us a place which we discovered in the end was further away. As a result this unfortunately left us sometimes with the need to find out thing for ourselves. Overall the hotel is wonderful and we will definitely return there again but in our opinion these 2 things could be improved and are something to look out for.

<Content>Cosy and convenient hotel I have been to Beijing for many times. This is the first time for me staying in this hotel. To my surprise, it located very near Wangfujing central. It takes about 8 mins walk. If you were first time travelling to Beijing, I would recommend this hotel. The hotel is small but clean and comfortable. I also got a very good rate via hotel website.

<Content>great staff and free broadband internet We stayed for 1 night at the Park Plaza upon arrival in Beijing and before flying to Lhasa Tibet the very next day. The room was very nice and the staff was extremely helpful. We only had an email from our Tibetan travel agent regarding the flight to TIbet and I wanted to make sure that we were actually booked on the Air China flight. The staff took a lot of time to call Air China and confirm that we were on the flight. They also verified that we had the proper Tibet permit to go to Lhasa.All in all, a very pleasant experience. We also really liked the free internet.For the Starbucks addicts, there is an outlet right across the street. Another benefit is the somewhat secluded location of the hotel from the main street (reduced noise from the street).

<Content>Very nice hotel Very nice hotel. Still seems very new. Room was big and clean...very glad to see after a long flight. Bed nice, great pillows. Was a little worried about the sign that said, do not drink tap water....they provided 2 bottled waters everyday. Not much of a view, but who cares. Front desk was a little standoff-ish to me, but they were very talkative to our guide. Getting money was easy. Breakfast was very good, with many choices....filled up and only needed dinner afterwards. Concierge and other staff nice. Location is good...Wangfujing Mall is nearby but walk seemed to take forever....probably because it was so hot. Overall, very nice.

<Content>This is a wonderful hotel We spent our last night in Beijing in this hotel. We'd just spent two weeks in Tibet and this hotel was a welcome oasis. The rooms were exceptionally clean, modern and comfortable. We enjoyed room service ordering a late night snack and breakfast in bed. We found the service to be prompt and curteous and the hotel rate of $115 a night to be a great value. This hotel is approximately 40 minutes from the airport (without traffic). A great find!

<Content>Couldn't ask for better Based on the TripAdvisor rating, we booked the Park Plaza at the beginning of our trip, and we liked it so much that we also stayed there at the end of our vacation. The rooms are exactly what you need after a 10+ hour flight: spotless and comfortable (lovely soft beds, fluffy sheets, gleaming bath room, excellent water pressure in the shower). The staff is friendly and accommodating for whatever one could need, be it a dinner reservation, suggestions on what to see and do, or help booking tickets for travel elsewhere in China. The restaurant and bar are pleasant as well - in all, an excellent place to stay in Beijing.

<Content>Simply Wonderful Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights  it was wonderful. The hotel is very new and the location is great, about 10min stroll to Wangfujing.I booked 2 standard rooms on the internet and thought I had a really good deal. However on the day before my departure, I checked on the rates again and was shocked to see that the rates have dropped by RM200 per room per night! Anyway, when I got there, I made a little fuss and in the end I got free breakfast throughout my stay. I also requested for a connecting room and to my surprise, the connecting room seemed to be a suite as it has a seperate lounge/study room. The rooms are big  new and the beds are very comfortable. We had a little problem with the airconditioning as it refuses to get to the temperature we want.There was not much of a view as the hotel is behind Regent but the room still get pretty much sunlight.I had a great time there and I'll definately stay at the hotel again.

<Content>Great hotel, good price and location I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The staff have all been very helpful, my room had free broadband and was spotless. I ordered room service for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised by the excellent service and food. If you book at this hotel check out their internet rates as I managed to get a great rate through their website. Once I arrived at the hotel I was given a free room upgrade too. The location is great for visits to many of the downtown sites and shopping. The only thing I would say is if you want to get a feel for real Beijing spend a night or two at a hotel located in a Hutong, it's a totally different experience. However, if you're here on business or prefer the luxuries of an international chain then by all means choose the Park Plaza it's well worth it.

<Content>Great hotel with good location Stayed here with my husband in May for 5 nights. Staff were really helpful, nice and friendly. The location was fantastic within walking distance to all the shops. Buffet breakfast was good with lots to choose from. We ate in a couple of the restaurants and they were quite good too. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great, clean and good location. Stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. The beds are very comfortable. The rooms were very clean and the service was excellent. Room service was a little pricey but well worth it. Had dinner and breakfast in the room and all was very fresh and good. The staff was very helpful. Got lots of good info from Jeff Zhang who works at the concierge desk. The tours are pricey. You can find your own a lot cheaper. Set up a tour to go to the great wall at Mutianyu and had the driver all day. The charge was $800RNB. We probably would have negotiated that but we were flying in from Datong that day and our plane was delayed so the driver waited for us several different times at airport as no one really knew what time our plane was arriving. Our driver, Yong, was there waiting when we arrived as our flight was 3 hours late with cold drinks in hand ready to take us. Yong spoke english but was hard to understand sometimes. We got to Mutianyu around 2 which was perfect as it wasnt crowded at all. A cable car takes you up to the top and you can walk down or have a choice to take the cable car or toboggle down to the bottom. Of course, I took the toboggle. So much fun. Next morning went to see the Summer Palace and Forbidden City. If you are pressed for time I would recommend the Summer Palace over the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City is just a bunch of buildings and museum stuff. Best to go across the street on the back side of Forbidden city. Looks to have more interesting stuff..If you want to do local shopping. Go to Hutong where the locals go and live. Wangfujing Street is overpriced. TIPS: Best to take your hotel info written in chinese so that the taxi knows exactly where to go. When arriving at airport use the Taxi Station where all drivers are legal. The taxi station is right outside the airport and clearly marked. Almost got hustled by a women stating she was the controller and could get us a taxi. Some guy pops up out of nowhere and starts to direct us elsewhere. Probably would have paid triple if I had gone with that person. Chinese people can spot tourist easily and try to hustle them. If you ignore them and dont pay attention they will leave you alone. If you respond to them they wont leave you alone and follow you for as long as they can.

<Content>Nice Hotel in a Difficult City After reading the glowing reviews of the Park Plaza, I think my expectations were a little high... that being said, after 4 days of navigating one of my least favorite cities, it was definitely a nice refuge! For the most part, the staff speaks english, which was helpful. There is free wireless internet access in the rooms, which are comfortable and modern. The location is good as far as I can tell (it always seemed to take forever to get anywhere with the traffic, obviously not the hotel's problem!) BONUS: there is a starbucks 100 feet from the front of the hotel. Yeah!My one disappointment with the room was the bathtub/shower. The tub was clogged and backed up with water rapidly, and the shower curtain is cloth (not plastic), which did not keep water in. The room was always soaked! And it smelled moldy. We dealt with it, but it wasn't ideal.

<Content>Vanilla My wife and I stayed at the Park Plaza Wangfujing for two nights - May 18-19, 2007.My first recommendation for this hotel is to make certain you have the hotel name written down in Chinese prior to getting in a taxi. The hotel is not well known amongst Beijing taxi drivers, at least not the dozen or so I asked to take us to the Park Plaza.I hate to start on a sour note, but the check in was simply awful. The hotel clerk, while friendly enough, must have been on his first day. He did manage to get us checked in with the help of a colleague, but when he refused to change a hundred so that I could tip the bellman I realized he was plain incompetent.The rooms are fine - clean sheets, nice bed, tv, free wired internet, mini bar and safe. The bathroom is a good size and the towels are clean. Ladies - bring your own conditioner. The best part about the hotel is the housekeeping staff. The room was impeccably clean and the turn down service a nice touch. The room service is prompt and the food passable. About 10 USD per meal per person. The breakfast is average serving low quality juices, asian and western standards and an omelet stand.I do not recommend the tours booked by the concierge. The prices are about double what you would pay at the local tour agents. Particularly annoying is the fact that the Park Plaza is the second of nine hotels on the coach pick up tour. Therefore a six hour tour to the Great Wall took eight hours while we stopped at every hotel in Dongcheng and the CBD both ways. The tours also include and stop a a 'Silk Museum' which is a blatant scam. Book a private car for tours if you have the means.In conclusion, I would recommend this hotel. However, I am not sure why it would merit such a high ranking on trip advisor. The staff is fair, the rooms are standard and the food average. The value for money is fine. The location is the best part about the place. The Park Plaza Wangfujing is a safe bet, but nothing special.Good luck in your travels.

<Content>Fantastic service Staying in this hotel was a fantastic experience. The staff were so friendly and helpful and the concierge was wonderful. Nothing was toomuch trouble - anytime we wanted to go out, the concierge had a taxi arranged in minutes for us. The hotel room was very well equipped andwas much bigger than I expected. Breakfast was excellent - there was so much to choose from every morning. I would definitely stay in thishotel again and would have no hesitation about recommending it for anyone staying in Beijing.

<Content>Worth every penny This is my first trip to Beijing. By accident I booked two hotels, the Park Plaza and the Sino-Swiss by the airport. Thank god I did this because the Sino-Swiss is an absolute DUMP. Please see my review for that hotel.The Park Plaza is a very beautiful and modern hotel. From the second you walk through the very cool revolving front door you know your in a very special hotel. Granted I have not stayed in other hotels in Beijing, but I would defintiely stay here again.My rate was 1100RMB for which i recieved a great 2 room suite. When you walk in you enter a small foyer which leads you to the sitting and work area. Great desk over looking the city, very comfy couches, which I took a nice arrival snooze on.The bathroom is fantastic, seperate (hot and strong) shower and toilet, beautiful bath and great sink. I happen to think that the most important features of a room should be a good shower/bathroom  a comfortable bed. This hotel has both.The buffet breakfast caters to both western and eastern pallets. Plenty to choose from. Fresh egg station was really good. Breakfast was included in my rate.I only had two small issues, one is the check-in which took a little while and the second is the internet which keeps cutting in and out.A quick hop in a taxi (15-20 RMB) will get you to Tian鈥檃n Men Square and the Fobidden City. I will write seperate reviews on these two must see attractions.Taxi to and from the airport will run about $100RMB.Great hotel. Will stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel! I always read the reviews posted on tripadvisor before planning a trip. After finding out that this hotel is voted as the 3rd most popular hotel in Beijing, I immediately checked out their website after seeing the average price per night. I had got a special rate of $80 CAD/night, including breakfast. I really don't think that at this price, there is a hotel that can compete with the location, cleanliness, and service. The concierge staff was excellent in providing us with information on tours and helping us get around the city. I would highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to return.

<Content>A pleasant stay.... I recently stayed at the Crowne Plaza Wangfujing for 6 days and 5 nights.the location is superb, just a stone's throw away from the Wangfujing Night market and 5 mins brisk walk to Quanjude, the famous peiking duck restaurant. Most taxi drivers know where it is as well.The hotel staff were friendly and top marks to the concierge and bellboys for going through great lengths in helping me retrieve a package i left on my trolley whilst getting into a taxi at the airport. - and realising it only after 2 hours!!! Could not have asked for better bunch of people. Most of them spoke English although some, rather basic. what I liked was the 3D location map of Beijing, provided by the hotel to all guests. It also indicated approximate taxi fares to the popular tourist locations from the hotel, in order to prevent you from being taken for a ride by the taxi drivers literally. Only down side was the lack of breakfast buffet variety - it didnt change one bit in 6 days....after the 3rd day, I could decide what I wanted for breakfast whilst in the shower. :POverall, will not hesitate to stay at this hotel the next time I am in Beijing again.

<Content>Perfect Location for a weekend stay Wife and I stayed here for 3 nights and it was within walking distance to the Forbidden City (15 minutes) and subway stop (Dongdan). Easy to get to shopping and food (2 blocks from Wangfujing St). Customer-facing staff spoke excellent english and always made sure that the taxis got the directions right before you left the hotel. Great breakfast buffet as well. Will definitely stay here again if we're back in town.

<Content>First rate hotel Great hotel: large rooms with every amenity conceivable. Great buffet and very friendly, accommodating staff who spoke excellent English. The rooms were overheated, however, and the temperature could not be adjusted. Also, the lobby bar is understocked if you like martinis.

<Content>Great place to wind down after a day of walking Location - Convenient as hotel is located 2 bocks from Wangfujing St. Aaround the corner, there is a 24 hour convenience store here you can buy water and snacks from.Room - Fantastic as we had a suite on Corporate rates. No issues with water pressure and heating. Plasma tv was a bonusConcierge services - Nelson provides A grade service. He tells you the local hot spots/bars and places to eat and shop. Also, when we were out once and having trouble translating our destination to our taxi drver, we just called up the hotel, spoke to Nelson to help us translate to the taxi driver. Spotty service from the rest of the concierge staff.Breakfast buffet was good. Omellete man was there too!Overall - I would stay there again if I am in BeijingKG, Australia

<Content>Nice  This is a nice and relatively new small 4 stars hotel in a central location... but it is not yet up to standard. I have 2 major complaints during our stay.1. Central heating does not work properly. The temperature could not be adjusted therefore it was all the time very hot and air is very dry! We had to open the windows to get fresh air to cool down the temperature but we could not sleep at night having the windows opened due to the contruction noise from the building site next to the hotel. These poor people work through the night (24 hours)! In genreal, there are many new building sites in the center and its surrounding, so pollutions and noise are really a big problem!2. Breakfast buffet is bad! The food is cold and not much varieties comparing to other hotels we have stayed in Beijing.Overall I would still recommand this hotel to others if they don't mind the above mentioned problems.

<Content>Nice Hotel, But... Got a little 'Lost in Translation' I'm pretty picky when it comes to hotels. The two things I look for in a hotel are the aesthetics (modern hotels are a plus) and the cleanliness. Well this hotel met expectations for both of these areas. The hotel was very modern, the rooms were a very nice size and the room I had was very clean. Now to the service (which is really not a big deal for me as long as the aesthetics and cleanliness meet my expectations), the service could use some improving, or perhaps it was just the front desk person who assisted me. Service issue #1: My reservation was booked by my company and clearly requested a king size bed. When I arrived to my room, I found two twin beds. So I go back down to the front desk and graciously ask the same gentleman who checked me in to honor my reservation and to place me in a king-bed room. He changed me to a different room, but of course with a little attitude. So I go to my new room and before I walk in, I notice the door of the room across from mines had what appeared to be a large amount of mold growing on it. I dismissed it to possibly being caused by a recent flood, but when I walked into my room, it reeked of this mold smell. I immediately went back down to the front desk and told him about this and requested a different room. Well, at this point he was extremely agitated by me and immediately told me that there were no other rooms (w/o even looking in the computer). So I told him to just put me back into my original room because the smell of mold was unbearable. Growing even more agitated now, he snatched my room key away from me and exchanged my room. I dismissed it because at this point I was exhausted and I just wanted to get to a decent room. Service issue #2: The first night in my room I noticed that it was extremely cold. I tried adjusting the thermostat but the room never got any warmer. The next day I informed the front desk, so they sent housekeeping to my room 鈥榯o adjust the thermostat for me鈥?(despite my telling them that I had already tried this).. Housekeeping adjusted the thermostat (same way I did the evening prior) and told me to just wait. Well after a few hours of shivering I phoned the front desk again. They told me, 鈥渨ell sorry nothing we can do, we can bring you more blankets.鈥?MORE BLANKETS??? It鈥檚 November in Beijing and very cold outside鈥?I wanted heat, not extra blankets!!! I told them I did not need more blankets, I needed maintenance to come up to fix the issue. They finally sent maintenance up and the heating was soon fixed.Despite my mishaps with the service, all in all this is a very nice hotel and I鈥檇 still recommend it to a friend. Just the whole language barrier can get in the way at times (as I鈥檓 sure can happen at any hotel when you鈥檙e in a foreign country).

<Content>Park hotel modern Stayed at the Park Plaza Beijing October 2oth 24th. New Hotel but Taxi drivers did not seem to know it even with card from hotel given to them. Hotel is hidden away a bit from the main road. Staff and reception good, Would stay at the Novatel rather than Park, only because no one could find it. Went to Great wall at Bandalang. Hated the crowds and the funny pulley cars that take you up the mountain. Glad I have seen Beijing but have no desire to visit again.

<Content>Nelson the concierge was excellent Our stay at the Park Plaza was excellent. We had a little trouble getting there as the hotel is quite new and perhaps not all the taxi drivers are aware of it. Location wise it is excellent. 2 blocks from the top of Wanfujing walking street. The rooms were nice and very clean. Everything had a brand new feel to it.The breakfast was fine, but we usually went somewhere else to have a more chinese meal.The best thing about the hotel was the concierge Nelson. He put us on to some really nice places, he wrote down the address in chinese and made sure the taxi driver knew where. One place was for dim sum, and it was so good we had to keep going back.We found it wasn't very easy to change money in China, I'd recommend just using an ATM. I've read a lot of reports about chinese ATMs not accepting cards but I had no trouble, try the Citibank ATMs.We saw a not very good acrobatics show that there were brochures for at reception. Get the cheapest seats only, it seemed that westerners all got put in the front row whatever they paid. We also saw the Shaolin monks show, that was very good.We stayed for 5 nights. Other reviews talked about construction noise and there was construction going on across the road, but it didn't disturb us.All in all the Park Plaza was great.

<Content>Great service, love it This was a fantastic hotel. Fairly new, so the accomodations were crisp and clean. The concierge was so kind and patience, I'm sure they remember us for our thousands of questions (for which they had answers to almost every one). Rooms were spacious with internet connection. The hotel is on a strip with lots of other big hotels so the area is well known. However, the hotel is behind a business office tower, so it shields it from noise. We looked out our window to some water fountains below, very peaceful. Prb a $3 cab ride to the Forbidden City and Tienammen Square. The hotel can also get you reservations at almost any show or restaurant and have the tickets delivered that day to your door. Breakfast was good with lots of variety and included in the price. Would definetely stay again.
