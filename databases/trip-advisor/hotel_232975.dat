<Content>Simply perfect My husband and I spent only one night in IL GUELFO BIANCO, but it was really nice. Above all, people at the reception were extremely kind, friendly and helpful. We liked it and we will come back.

<Content>Il Guelfo Bianco The hotel website really didn't do justice to this hotel which was a pleasant surprise. The art work spread throughout the hotel is great adding to the relaxing homelike feel. Located a easy walk down the street to the main square really made getting around easy. Staff was very helpful confirming our choices in restaurants and getting cabs when required. Couldn't beat the size of the room!

<Content>Great base for exploring We booked this hotel for a 4-night stay in September based on other TripAdivsor recommendations and we weren't disappointed. Only two blocks from the Piazza del Duomo, it makes a superb base for exploring this beautiful city.Our bedroom, away from the main street as we had requested, was in the original part of the building, and the wooden panelling and high ceilings added a touch of character lacking in most modern hotels. The room was large by European standards, as was the en-suite which included a full-size bath - just ideal for relaxing after a day's sightseeing. The only potential issue was the poorly fitting windows but the autumn temperatures were still high enough for this not to present any real problem.The breakfast room was bright and airy, and the selection on offer varied each day, with home-made items being added to the standard supply of cereals, fruit, croissants, cold meats and cheese. The multi-lingual staff were always helpful without being pushy.We will certainly stay here again on our next visit to Florence.

<Content>Superb hotel in the best location I was pleasantly surprised to see the quality and decor of the room. It was elegant, but simple. From the heated bathroom floors to the solid wooden window blinds, the hotel room had solid workmanship. The staff was genuinely friendly and courteous. I look forward to staying there again when I travel back to Firenze!

<Content>Very good, comfortable hotel We had two rooms for our family (traveled with our 2 young adult children) in late November. One room was a junior suite and next door was a standard double. Junior suite was large with nice bathroom, couch and large screen TV with loads of channels. Double room was obviously smaller but more than adequate. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Helpful staff and breakfast was good with delicious brioche and fruit tart/cake. They made you coffee as requested. Location was okay- very near the Duomo, Accademia and San Lorenzo market. It was on a busy street that was not very picturesque. If went back would consider staying in another area of the city but this worked out fine. Our rooms were very quiet but be sure to ask for this as we met other people whose rooms were facing the front of the hotel and the busy street and they had sleepless nights due to the noise. Also check out their room specials on-line (contact them directly). They list several specials and we paid in advance with a very steep discount.

<Content>I would highly recommend the Il Guelfo in Florence We spent a long weekend in Florence discovering the city and the sights and the hotel was just wonderful. Great central location and we managed to wheel our way from the railway station with our luggage no trouble at all. We were greeted by friendly enthusiastic staff who quickly reverted to speaking English which is great as our Italian is fairly limited. The staff were always on hand to offer advice and service. The room was at the end of a corridor and overlooked the internal courtyard therefore it was very private. The standard of the room was above average and bigger than I was expecting for a city hotel. Decor was tasteful Italian with lovely antique furniture and kept very clean. Breakfast was plentiful and we looked forward to the fresh coffee, pastries and cakes every morning. I would highly recommend this hotel it made our stay very enjoyable and we would certainly stay there again on our return visit.

<Content>Best Hotel we stayed at in Italy and amazing value during winter This hotel is listed as a 3 star, but was much nicer than other 3 stars we stayed at. I definitely felt pampered at Il Guelfo Bianco and thought maybe I had booked a 4 star without realizing. We stayed in November and our rates were well under half what the summer rates are so we got an amazing value at just 100 Euro per night.Bathrooms - large, modern, clean, tastefulRooms - large, quiet, and modern, but with antique character of the building showing through. Great minibar and large (for italy) flatscreen TV with channels in all languages.Breakfast - Great service, great food, breakfast room is very nice - in good weather you can sit on the patio. Cheeses and meats included. Pay extra for fruit.Front Desk - extremely helpful in directions, recommendations, calling taxi, etc.We will definitely return to this hotel!

<Content>One of the best values in Italy! This was our 6th stay at El Guelfo. As always the staff is attentive and extremely helpful. Dinner reservations, train schedules, whatever your needs are the staff is there to help. Every one of the rooms is appointed differently. Each one with its ow charm. The breakfast is first class, a notch above other like hotels. In our extensive travels in Italy, we find that el Guelfo is the best value we have found.Robert  Rose KrawetzSt. PAul, Minnesota

<Content>We loved Il Guelfo Bianco We spent 10 days in Florence and stayed at Il Guelfo Bianco. What a wonderful hotel! Our room was charming with tasteful decorations (especially the beautiful Italian tile in the bathroom). It was quiet at night, and the bed was very comfortable. We also enjoyed all of the interesting art work displayed throughout the hotel.Il Guelfo Bianco is in a great location. It's walking distance to everything.We LOVED the complementary breakfast offered every morning in the cheerful breakfast room. Excellent coffee was brought to our table, and we could choose from a wonderful assortment of fresh breakfast items. They offered the best yogurt I have ever tasted, fresh fruit, an assortment of fresh bakery items (loved the croissants and the tart), hard-boiled eggs, fresh juice, granola, and a lovely assortment of jams and honeys. I normally do not like the quality of complementary breakfasts in American hotels, but we looked forward to our Italian breakfast every morning. (I really miss Italian caffe and yogurt now that we are home.)The best thing about Il Guelfo Bianco is the wonderful staff. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. We were warmly greeted as we would come and go on our daily outings. They had great suggestions for restaurants to try. (Our favorite was Ristorante Cafaggi, just 2 blocks away. Their grilled calamari was exquisite!) I can't say enough good things about Il Guelfo Bianco. We really felt we were experiencing the best of Florence. Grazie mille to everyone at the hotel for all of your wonderful hospitality!! We hope we can return soon.Kathleen and Bob DedonSeattle, WA

<Content>Wonderful Find in Florence I traveled to Italy with my two adult daughters and son. ( All in their 20's).Il Guelfo Bianco turned out to be the perfect place for us in Florence. We had the apartment which was two bedroom, and two bathrooms. It also has a huge living/dining room and a small kitchenette.( We did not use the kitchen.) The set up was great for us. It was such a plus to have two bathrooms.Although the shower is tiny as other reviewers have stated, it was a very good shower and not a problem for any of us and my son is over six feet tall. Everyone that worked there that was so friendly, kind and helpful. It was totally immaculate. The furnishings are simple, but it really did feel as if we had our own apartment in Florence. The breakfast was more than adequate and everything was fresh and tasty! Other reviewers have also mentioned the tiny elevator to the apartment. It is VERY small but we actually had good laughs about it, so it was not a problem. I highly recommend Il Guelfo Bianco for excellent value, great location and top notch service. We will be back!

<Content>Best staff ever! I stayed here with my husband and daughter the first week of November. We just loved this place! I cannot emphasize enough how friendly and helpful the staff were (hey Danieli and Julia and everyone!). We extended from two to three nights because the room was so big and comfortable and the hotel so convenient to many attractions. This was the least expensive hotel room we stayed in in Italy (even for a deluxe room) and yet it was our favorite. The breakfasts were great, typical of all the Italian hotels we stayed in, the room was very clean, huge, and amazingly quiet. We had to open the window at night as our room was warm and even with the window open, we hardly heard a sound all night. Make sure and ask for a room at the back of the hotel if you want this kind of quiet.As we knew nothing of Florence, the staff was constantly helping to answer our questions, making dinner reservations every night, they even booked us a room in Cinque Terre as we had decided at the last minute to travel there. They gave us train schedules, made amazing restaurant recommendations...they even helped a couple of young American men we had met in Florence with their train schedule.The location is great, just a couple of minutes from the Duomo (make sure and climb to the top of the dome!). I also must add that the staff recommended La Giostra for dinner (and made us a key reservation as we couldn't have gotten in without one). This dinner was one of my favorite memories of Italy. Delicious food in a beautiful, warm setting. What a night! The hotel is also a few steps from the outdoor market which was a blast and where we found great bargains on leather and scarves and all sorts of fun things.

<Content>Pefectly located hotel The hotel Il Guelfo Bianco is perfectly located near all the main attractions and within walking distance of the railway station. Our superior room on the first floor was spacious and immaculately furnished with original antiques. The hotel staff were exemplary and nothing was too much trouble. This hotel comes with a AAAAA recommendation.

<Content>Nice Little Hotel My wife and myself just returned from a trip to Paris, Venice, Florence, Rome and Amsterdam. In Florence we stayed at the Il Guelfo Bianco. The staff was great, the room good size and spotless, the location turned out very good, and the breakfast buffet was wonderful. We paid 200 Euro for an executive room which was just the right size. Our room 112 was in the back so it was completely silent. The only problem was they had already switched to heat, so we had no AC, but we could open the window and it was comfortable at night for sleeping. The breakfast buffet was better than our hotel in Venice. All the pastries and cereals were great, and Capuccino also, but they had the best hot chocolate. They also had bruschetta with fresh mozzarella, which was unusual for breakfast, but was great. The location turned out to be around the corner from the Academia and 5 minutes to the Duomo and 10 minutes to the Ufizzi. They recommended a terrific family run restaurant we ate at twice because it was great and reasonable - I' Toscano, around the corner. We used The Original  Best Walking Tours company for 4 tours including an all day tour to Tuscany hill towns and an olive and wine farm. That was probably the highlight of our trip.

<Content>Loved the Guelfo Bianco Firenze is a magic city, and staying in the Guelfo Biaco hotel turned it into an unforgettable experience.The room on the top floor was big, clean, quiet, sunny and we had a great view on Florence's rooftops.The bathroom was really nice after a few steps and had a window too. The only con would be the shower which lacked pressure. The service was really good, helpful and friendly. The breakfast was yummy, with fresh local products.I will be happy to return into this hotel, especially as we had a good deal on the room (33% off the regular price) from the hotel website.

<Content>Nothing Special Having read a lot of the other reviews I just feel I must have missed something. The hotel was generally OK. Nothing out of the ordinary. The room was big, with a separate wardrobe area leading to a good clean bathroom.The girl who welcomed us was fantastic, but she was only there the first day and the various people who replaced her during the following 3 days were sometimes good and sometimes a bit snappy.The breakfast was OK, but why charge extra for fresh fruit or fruit juice?My biggest problem was with the internet. The only wi-fi hot spot is in the lobby, where there was no desk provided, and the signal kept coming and going. I gave up using my laptop and tried the desktop provided, but that was no better. In the end I had to use internet cafes instead. I think that needs sorting

<Content>Superb Location We agree with most of what has already been said about this hotel. The location is ideal for a break in Florence as it is near most of the sites you may want to visit. The rooms are beautiful and contain many original features. The hotel is clean and well maintained. It was not overrun with staff during our visit and for most of the time it seemed there was only one member of staff on the premises. He or she worked at Reception but left there if you wanted a drink from the bar or to take something to your room. More staff appeared in the mornings to serve breakfast and to service the rooms. The staff that we did have contact with were friendly and willing to help. The public rooms on the ground floor were not used very much during our stay and were not really designed for many guests to congregate at one time. On the whole, we were glad we found Il Guelfo Bianco. It is friendly, clean, well maintained and ideally located.

<Content>Wonderful hotel and staff My friend found this hotel on the TripAdvisor site. It is a small hotel but it has a lot of old world charm. Every one of our rooms was different and our rooms in the back were very quiet. I had to open the windows to hear the churchbells!! They offer a simple but nice breakfast. The location was excellent. Just a quick 5 minute walk to the Duomo (no exaggeration) and close to Grom, an awesome gelateria!! My friend and I had lost our luggage at Florence airport. (The truth is that is was still at Charles de Gaulle airport when we got to Italy.) Giulia called the airport for us the afternoon we arrived, and our luggage was delivered to the hotel by 10PM that same night!! What a relief! But it was very nice to know that someone in the hotel cared about my stressful moment. All members of the staff were friendly and helpful and gave the job 120% no matter how small the request. If you want to see true customer service at its best, check this place out! I can't say enough about this staff. They definitely deserve all the high marks they get on this site!

<Content>Serenity in the city Il Guelfo Bianco offers old world charm but with all the modern amenities, ie. large rooms, flat screen TV's, mini-bar and great tiled bathrooms with tubs. The rooms are very quiet (triple paned windows) something that tends to be non-existent in city center's or 15th century old buildings. Centrally located, it's a 5 minute walk to the San Marco market and Duomo. The owner's also have a large collection of contemporary art throughout the hotel and the staff is very accommodating with requests and suggestions. They are familiar with alot of great restaurants and will make reservations for you. Breakfast and espresso's are served in the small dining area or garden patio. I'd definitely stay here again, it's a perfect place to explore the beautiful city of Florence!

<Content>Love the Guelfo Bianco! My home in Florence.I absolutely loved my 10 days in Jul/Aug at this hotel. It was one of the highlights of my trip to Italy, and I would highly recommend to any one thinking of a central hotel in Florence. Do not bother with any other hotel, this is one of the very best hotels that I have ever stayed in anywhere.Hotel is in a league of its own compared to lots of hotels in Florence, and Italy for that matter. It is great value for a three star hotel, as it has the rooms, staff and overall service of a higher rating hotel. To begin with the Location is unbeatable for getting around Florence hot spots. Located in via Cavour, you can walk to anywhere of interest, all the sights, museums, galleries etc. It鈥檚 only 3 mins walk down to the Doumo, the famous Florence leather market is 2 mins away, so is the food markets ( yum-don鈥檛 miss it!), and then everything else in pretty much a 10-15 walk, Uffizi, Pitti Palace, Ponte Vecchio.My room at the hotel was 1st class, pretty spacious with lots of natural light. A big comfy bed, LCD TV, big spotlessly clean bathroom, fantastic balcony facing into an inner courtyard with views onto some old Florentine houses. The balcony room is room 124 for those who may be interested, it is a double room. The room servicing was daily and was really good, everything was kept spotlessly clean.Their complimentary toiletries in the bathrooms are worth a mention, they provided gorgeous olive oil based bathroom soaps and shampoos, all made in Italy ofcourse and much better than what you would normally get.The extra special staff, Federico, Daniel and the gorgeous Gulia, all professionals. Always happy and friendly, and will point you in the right direction for good restaurants etc. Their reception service is better than average and to be commended.  The hotel offers all sorts of extra little touches that other hotels just over look, choccies at the bar in the lobby, the staff often made me a coffee, or a nice little aperitif to have at the bar with my choccie.A computer point is available for hotel guests, all the latest magazines and also some books for guests enjoyment.Breakfast is just simply scrumptious, and all you need to start your day. On offer are all the usual goodies that you get plus more, there's yummy fresh fruit, organic jams, delicious cr猫me filled croissants, fresh coffee, boiled eggs, bruschetta, cheeses, prosciutto, what other hotel would have prosciutto and bruschetta for breakfast if you want it, much better than the standard breakfast at most hotels .Thanks to everyone at the hotel!You made it all so easy to stay there, thanks for taking care of my needs and giving me such a great room. Everything made my stay absolutely fantastic and I can鈥檛 wait to come back soon.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Highly Recommended! We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in August and would highly recommend it. We were given a room with a terrace which was wonderful. The location is wonderful. Less than five minutes walk from the Duomo. Less than 10 minutes walk from most of the major churches. Two minutes from the gallery housing the David. The daytime receptionist was extremely helpful. She even took my leather backback home with her to get it repaired for me. I can't say enough nice things about the receptionist. This is Europe, so do not expect American size rooms, but the rooms were large for the price range. The bathroom was large, modern and clean. The internet is charged extra and I would advise to goto one of the internet cafes as the rates are very reasonable.

<Content>Wonderful stop for Honeymoon!! Wow! We stayed at this charming hotel for 2 nights during our Honeymoon. Everything about the hotel is top-notch. The front desk was unbelievably helpful. They made reservations for us at two museums and found us great restaurants both nights we were there (no easy feat for Florence in August)!Our room was lovely and very large. It was at least twice, probably three times the size of rooms we stayed in other cities on our trip. Impeccably clean with a good breakfast every morning I simply cannot recommend this hotel enough!

<Content>Perfect Loctaion So close to walking EVERYWHERE. The staff was friendly and helpful. Made great dinner recommendations. We were a little concerned (my husband, and my in-laws) about how noisy outside was, but our rooms were SO quiet. The rooms were probably the biggest of any hotel we stayed in Italy, and very clean. The only complaint I would have is the A/C wasn't the coldest (but we were also in Florence during the hottest weekend they had all summer).If and when I return to Florence I would go back to this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic experience at the Guelfo Bianco I have little to add beyond what other recent reviews cite. Just wanted to share my experience of this hotel, which was completely positive. We arrived in Florence very early in the morning by train from Munich. I was worried that the front desk might not yet be open, or a room available (we wanted to dump our stuff and take a shower before going out sightseeing). The hotel was open, and a room was instantly available. The room itself was spacious and beautifully decorated, with very high ceilings paneled in wood coffers. The bathroom was modern and large. We had a double deluxe class room.Several people staffed the front desk in turns; all spoke fluent English, all were cheerful and helpful, and were of great assistance booking tours and making restaurant recommendations.The hotel itself is very conveniently located. We walked there from the train station (about 10 minutes), and the distance to the duomo or other major sights is very small.I would definitely stay here again on a future visit, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend il Guelfo Bianco to anyone else going to Florence.

<Content>Wonderful Charming Hotel As a professional who works in the travel industry, I have rarely stayed at a nicer hotel. My wife and I stayed at Hotel Il Guelfo Bianco for two nights in August and absolutely loved this centrally situated hotel. Our room was exquisitely decorated in traditional Tuscan style. The bathrooms have beautiful hand painted ceramic tiles. The hotel staff is extremely nice and the breakfast included in the room rate is delectable. For the price you can't get any better. On my next stay in Florence I am definitely returning to Hotel Il Guelfo Bianco.

<Content>great location We stayed for 4 nights at Il Guelfo Bianco in Florence. It is in a great location, about 5 minutes from the Duomo and 2 minutes from the Accademia. It is on a busy street but our room faced an inner courtyard and it was very quiet. The room was clean and spacious. At the front desk, Frederico gave us great restaurant ideas and Giulia graciously helped us with other things, like explaining the bus system.Your room key turns on the air conditioning; when you are away all day, the air is off. It is an efficient way to save energy...you don't come back to an air conditioned room when you are out all day, but it didn't take long for the a/c to cool the room down. You may want to think about taking a room that doesn't get a lot of sun if you are there in the summer (although the heavy curtains worked pretty well against the sun's heat).Breakfast was just enough to get you started and there is plenty to choose from. Eating in one of the courtyards is delightful, but depends on whether or not guests who are in the rooms that face the courtyards are up when you decide to eat. Plenty of nice tables inside when this happens (and nice to know that if you are sleeping in, you won't be disturbed by people eating outside your window, as it were).

<Content>Long-time Client - I take my tour groups here I am a tour operator and have been taking my small groups to the Guelfo Bianco for over 3 years now and have been very satisfied with all the responses I get from my clients.I was born and raised in Florence, so I was very pleased when I saw how the owners had restructured a noble residence in V. Cavour, one of the largest street's in Florence's historical center, into a fabulous hotel with modern amenities, while at the same time, preserving the original structure and its charm.I have personally visited over 100 hotels (small and large) in my home town and this is one of the best ones.Here are what I consider the advantages of this hotel and why I chose it for my groups:- It's centrally located in the historical center, in walking distance to all the major sites- It's on a wide street, which may not seem like a big deal, but if you're trying to unload your bags in a tiny street and you're holding up traffic, this comes as a real plus.- All the staff is incredibly helpful and smiling, including Gen. Manager Antonella, and the owner's daughter, Giulia, who also works at the hotel.- The rooms are larger than the average that you'll find in any historical area in Italy.- It's close to internet cafe's, ATMs, the Tourist information Center, and great restaurants.

<Content>Great Experience My regular room was extraordinary. Beautiful furniture, linens, bathroom (with really good water pressure in the shower). Even though the hotel is right in the middle of the city, it was quiet. Great location between the Duomo and San Marco. Staff was polite, helpful and went out of their way to make my experience a good one.

<Content>Exceeded Customer Service Expectations The hotel added immensely to the enjoyment of our short stay in Florence. The facility was very pleasant and the staff was enthusiastically helpful. We were always greeted with a genuine and broad smile at the front desk. Our questions and requests were handled promptly and thoroughly. We loved the little chocolate sweets made available to guests on the hotel bar and enjoyed one each time we passed through the lobby. The greatest commitment to customer service, however, occurred AFTER we checked out of the hotel. Several days after leaving the hotel, I could not find my beloved black sandals, which were of a discontinued style. I emailed the last two hotels where we had stayed to inquire about the lost sandals. The 1st hotel did not even respond. Il Guelfo Bianco responded promptly that my sandals were there and that they would be happy to send them to me if I provided the address. I emailed back with my home address in the United States and provided my credit card number to pay for the shipping. The hotel replied that they would send the sandals promptly and: 'We also thank you for the credit card details but we are not going to charge you anything.....its our pleasure to send them back to you!' THIS IS THE SORT OF CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT SETS IL GUELFO BIANCO A NOTCH ABOVE OTHER FINE HOTELS!SharonHouston, TX

<Content>The Charming Guelfo Biano We recently had a wonderful stay at the charming Guelfo Bianco in Florence. Right in the inner city, a couple of blocks away from the Accademia with its David, the hotel is a quiet, tasteful oasis. Rooms are charming, service is excellent, breakfast is served in a lovely room, and the location is wonderful. We are a family of five and the hotel had a terrific apartment that served us very well. Highly recommended.

<Content>Great location and lovely hotel! Our stay at Il Guelfo Bianco was connected to a tour of Tuscany. We were very pleased with our accommodations. We stayed at the hotel several days at the start and end of our tour. Our first room was on the 2nd floor. It was a large and beautiful room 鈥?with tasteful antique furniture 鈥?and so quiet with the double windows at the front. After our week at a villa in Tuscany, we returned to the hotel and it felt like we were coming home. This time we had a room on the 3rd floor that was also was well appointed and comfortable. As an aside - the beds are extraordinarily comfortable. The lobby, breakfast room, and garden room were nicely decorated. The hotel is a convenient location for exploring Florence. The proximity to the Piazza del Duomo is a real plus.The staff was very friendly and helpful with making restaurant suggestions and reservations, especially Giulia and Matteo. They both went out of their way to assist us and make us feel very welcome. We would defiantly recommend Il Guelfo Bianco to our friends and family for travel and business.

<Content>What a Find! This was our fourth trip to Florence and this hotel is a find. It is very centrally located and within walking distance of all the major attractions. Our room was much nicer than what we expected for a 3 star, infact, it was nicer than some of the 4 stars we have stayed in.We also found the staff to be fabulous. They took care of our every need from making museum reservations to a driver to restaurant recommendations and so on.

<Content>Fabulous We stayed here for 3 nights in a double superior room and absolutely loved this hotel. The location is central, being a short walk from the Duomo and Accademia/David. We walked everywhere in Florence and found the hotel to be perfectly suited for this. We requested a quiet room facing the interior courtyard as opposed to facing the street. The hotel is superbly and warmly decorated with a combination of modern and traditional art. The room had a king sized bed, large upholstered chair and a writing desk. The bathroom was large and immaculate with a nice sized tub. The tub also had a shower apparatus but we took nice relaxing baths after long days of sightseeing. The staff was very accommodating and quickly answered my emails regarding reservations prior to the trip. They were very helpful and willing to make suggestions for restaurants and tours.There were a few outdoor seating areas, perfect for enjoying a bottle of wine. Breakfast was very good with proscuitto, breads, pastries, bruschetta, yogurt, cereal, fruit, juice, coffee, tea, etc. We thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and highly recommend staying here.

<Content>Wonderful! Il Guelfo Bianco went beyond my expectations. The staff there is incredible. I have travelled alot and have never experienced such a warm, welcoming staff who truly enjoy what they do. The hotel was wonderful and quaint. We stayed in the apartment on the top floor. It was good for the 4 of us (my 85 year old mother, my sister, my 28 year old niece and myself). It has 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a small kitchen, and a large living/dining room with what appears to be a twin sleeper. It is not luxurious--but spacious and definitely suited our needs. There are double paned windows to keep out the noise from the street (which was not excessive anyway). There is an elevator that goes from the lobby to the 2nd floor and then you walk up a small flight of stairs to another elevator which takes you to the third floor apt. The staff at Il Guelfo make you feel like you are coming home when you walk in the door. They are always smiling, gracious and willing to help. It is apparent that they truly enjoy their jobs. It is in a convenient location...not in the center of the piazza's/duomo but an easy walking distance. I loved Il Guelfo and will definitely return on my next trip to Florence!

<Content>Wonderful staff The hotel staff were exceptionally helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for them. All the staff we met were friendly and seemed please to help in order that we had a great stay. I would go back to this hotel. However if you are planning to spend a lot of time in the hotel, rather that use it as a base, you may find there's limited facilities.The room we stayed was large enough for the three of us and all beds were comfortable, even the sofa bed. The bathroom was very clean and reasonably spacious. The shower was powerful and water was constantly hot. We had air conditioning in the room which was necessary as our room over looked the main road and it would have been too noisy to have the windows open.The Hotel was central to all the main attractions and most were within walking distance.We flew into Pisa and took the airport bus as the trains were on strike, this worked reasonable well. On our return we went by train and left our luggage in the train station while we visited the tower.Things to watch for, 1) make sure you pre-order tickets for Galleria degli Uttizi  Academia, as the queue are extremely long, especially in the summer months.2) make sure you take the right travel plug adaptors, seemingly Italy is different to the rest of European countries.3) If you plan to travel around by local buses, you need to buy your tickets before getting on the bus.

<Content>Home Away from Home! I recently spent a few nights at this hotel and can't say enough nice things. The room I had was very large compared to most European hotels and the staff is so accommodating about everything. Their attitude is , just ask and you shall receive, if possible. They are very informed and informative and the location can't be beat!! You are within walking distance of everything and feel very safe. My room was on the back and was very quiet at night. Please don't hesitate to stay at this hotel - you won't regret a moment of your visit.

<Content>Old world charm, new world service My first visit to beautiful Florence was definitely enhanced by my stay at Il Guelfo Bianco. This charming little gem is located in the heart of old Florence, convenient to all the popular sites, wonderful little restaurants, and within walking distance of almost everything you'd want to see in Florence. The staff was exceptionally helpful and the morning breakfast was delicious. My room was spacious and the furnishings quaint, but comfortable. When I touch the boar's snout again, it will be from a stay at Il Guelfo Bianco!

<Content>comfortable charm We stayed here for 2 nts. Very pleasant and comfortable hotel.The staff was very helpful. The hotel is a few minutes walk to the Accademia where the David is, and in walking distance to just about everything. It is on a main avenue which can be a bit noisy at times during the night. The two rooms we hadwere very clean and with ample room. The furniture wasa bit dated though. Our stay here was quite comfortable, theonly negative I had was that breakfast is included with the room,but they did charge extra for the fresh fruit salad .

<Content>Loved the place !! We spent 3 days in Florence as a part of our 9 day trip to Italy and had taken 2 rooms for 4 of us. Il Guelfo made our stay in Florence worth remembering. The staff was very helpful and willing to do the little extra to make the stay special. We had a fire scare on one night during our stay but its commendable that the staff knocked on our rooms to ensure that we leave the premises. The fire was in the next door building so no damage done but it was some experience. The hotel is lovely with beautiful artifcats that are displayed on the walls, passageways and the ceilings as well. The breakfast was wholesome and good and the rooms were big with a large window opening on the street. But the best part is the location. The place is within a short walking distance to all the places that you can think of. A lovely place, well located with great staff. Now what else does anybody want other than maybe a few more days to stay there...

<Content>Great hotel - modern, safe, great location~ I just stayed here for over a week and found the hotel to be very clean, modern and safe. The location couldn't have been better. It's very central and just a block or so from Lorenzo market and the Duomo. The breakfast was very good. Among the 3 places I stayed in Italy, it was the best with excellent variety of hot and cold foods. They do try to charge extra for the fruit salad for some strange reason. Overall, the staff was friendly and helpful. The only reason why I give this place 4 instead of 5 stars was because a couple of the staff members were a bit unfriendly and abrasive. It probably won't be a problem for most, but I thought I'd share anyway.When I first arrived and went to bed, I noticed something small and black on the bedsheet so by reflex, I flicked it away. As I tried to sleep, I heard a scratching sound so I became worried it was a mouse (and perhaps that was a dropping). I asked the short Asian woman at the front desk to please change rooms but she seems unwilling and tried to tell me there were no rooms left (which was a lie since she did move me when I insisted). I went back up to move my stuff and the woman had followed me up. She burst in and started ripping up the sheets telling me abrasively that there is nothing on the sheet. She threw out a couple inconsistent excuses and pretty much called me a liar. The end was good though which is that I got a new room. The bad thing is that they charged me more for the room which no one told me until I realized the charge on the bill. This other light haired tall thin lady was also unfriendly to me. It might be personal because she was very friendly to my colleague. I wouldn't consider myself a difficult person at all and would only complain if there is something that made me very uncomfortable. But I think my reputation here was shot and this woman made sure to make me feel that way. She'd heartily greet my colleague when we walked in together and would outwardly ignore me.A good thing about the staff was that they recommended very good restaurants. They don't seem to be the type that recommend to get a kick back. Each place they recommended was fantastic. Aside from the 2 women I dealt with, everyone else was very helpful and friendly. Overall, I still think this place was a great place. I would stay here again and would recommend it. However, just put on thick skin if people there give you attitude. And if you change rooms, verify the price so there are no surprises.

<Content>Totally cared for at Il Guelfo Bianco We had the pleasure of staying at this Hotel for three nights in March , 2008 and if you are wanting to stay in the center of Florence close to everything at a Hotel that has so much individual personality and B and B charm ((for a semi big place)with some great art work everywhere we highly recommend this hotel. We contacted the hotel directly through their web site and found a special that we took advantage of that offered even more value to our wonderful stay. Perhaps because we had a junior suite towards the back of the building it was so quiet but such a large room with windows great art and a electrifying bathroom designed out of small red tiles with a large bath and a shower allowed us to enjoy the busy world of Florence with such relaxed enjoyment. The staff was great ,or perhaps we should say the two people at the front desk that we had the most contact with ,a beautiful young woman very real and helpful ( we wrote down their names and can not find them now , sorry) anyway she was fun and welcoming and a young man who went out of his way to write down 4 restaurants to try (we made it to two of them 1.Toscanna simple place where everything was delicious 2. Aqua duo very happening lively non traditional very good and you can sample everything so we stayed there for hours) because our next stop was Vernazza and he loved that area he wrote us some directions and highlights that when we were there took advantage of and he was right on the mark! The breakfast was good with many choices and a helpful staff that would make you coffees, our room was always tended to and they had a bar to have a happy hour or get some wine in the evening. 15 minutes or so walk to the train station the same to the river a block and a half to the duomo . The staff arranged for a reservation at the Uffizi for us with all the information and reservation contact about our stay handled clearly and professionally. Thank you IL Guelfo Bianco and thank you TA for the good time only wish we could have stayed longer!

<Content>My Perfect Hotel In Florence This is no kidding, the best location around and for a moderate price, extremely good service and comfort. Being just north of the Duomo, it is slightly away from the most touristy areas so the restaurants nearby are generally better. Just a short walk from everything you'd want to see, including a place in the University area where they will wash and fold your clothes for a reasonable price. The staff could not have been more lovely and considerate. We were lucky to go right before Easter and so got a tremendous buy on a deluxe superior room. Nice and large. Will definitely stay there again. Laura, New Jersey.

<Content>Comfort and Convenience in Florence My daughter and I had a great Italian experience during her spring break. Our three days and nights in Florence and at the Il Guelfo Bianco were charming and stress-free. The hotel was most convenient to the city center. Everything was in close walking distance - museums, churches, restaurants, and shopping. Out room was quite large with a high ceiling and a barrel arch in the center. The bathroom was large as well. Our breakfasts were included and were delicious and substantial. All the staff members we encountered were friendly and most helpful. They were able to provide us with a train schedule and a taxi to the station. Overall, the Il Guelfo Bianco contributed to our enjoyable visit to Florence.

<Content>Friendly, Convenient and Comfortable We can't say enough about our stay at Il Guelfo Bianco. Within a short walking distance of all the must see places in Florence, the rooms were large, comfortable and clean and the staff was not only friendly but very helpful - from arranging day trips or personal guides to giving us recommendations on great places to eat. Everyone seemed to truly care, throughout our stay, that we were enjoying ourselves and had everything we needed.

<Content>Great Hotel and location Excellent location to everything in Florence. Only five minute walk to the Central Market area and to the Dome. Very easy to return to drop off purchases. The hotel is very nice, rooms big with nice bathrooms. If you like to open your windows, get a room in the back of the hotel. The front street is very busy and noisey, but the rooms are fine if you keep the windows closed (triple panes) The hotel staff are the friendliest that we have encountered in a long time and very helpful. They are always willing to help you with suggestion for places to eat and things to do. They were all great. Breakfast was adequate, but they could add a few things. We would without a doubt stay here again.

<Content>Perfect location Il Guelfo Bianco was perfect for our family of four. Perfect location, close to everything, very large room, comfortable beds, nice bathroom, very good breakfast in a cozy breakfast room. the people running the hotel were very helpful--made museum reservations for us. The only negative, comes with the location though, is that we couldn't really open the windows because it would've been too noisy. The great location, though, was worth it.

<Content>A Gem We were delighted to find availability here when booking late for a quick 4 -day trip to look over some art schools in Florence. Guilia and Federico could not have been more helpful handling our booking (by email - in English - and with a couple of telephone calls, for the reason described below). We were offered for no extra cost the epicure + glamour package that consisted of some lovely goodies (organic olive oil, balsamic vinegar, preserves) and tickets to a fabulous exhibition on the history of contemporary haute couture in the Palazzo Strozzo. Which was a wonderful way to spend Sunday afternoon. But back to the hotel. We also accepted, 2 days before arriving, an 'upgrade' at no extra charge to the 2 bedroom suite on the 3rd Floor. This suited us, as a couple + single, gave us loads of space, with sitting room, kitchen, 2 bathrooms, etc. It was peaceful: v. little street noise. (Windows are double -or triple glazed, in any case). I guess it helped the hotel's occupancy rate too by freeing up the two rooms we had booked. The gastronomic tasting on Friday evening was a treat at 鈧? each including a couple of glasses of wine and some terrific local delicacies. We didn't need a restaurant after that, so we went to a fine little wine bar called Coquinarius in the Via delle Oche. However we succumbed to the temptation of a few crostini and some salad after the first bottle of a delicious red Bolgheri. (No, I hadn't heard of it either). But back to the hotel:The location is wonderful, very convenient for Duomo and Academia - only 5 minutes walk from the very heart of the city.Staff were unfailingly helpful, booking taxi's  making reservations for museums, galleries and restaurants cheerfully and efficiently. We'll definitely come back - If it's just the 2 of us, then we'll ask for a room on the 1st floor, as these are more impressive and seem more luxurious than those on the 2nd and the Suite on the 3rd.

<Content>A big bang for the buck! This is a great little hotel perfectly situated for easy access to touring a bulk of Florence on foot. I spent one morning taking photos of as many of the beautiful ceilings(!) in the hotel as were accessible! Antique furniture, lots and lots of original artwork, fabulous bathrooms (ours had a HUGE round tub) and staff always available to assist with taxis, umbrellas, etc. Try to book a room that is not on the street side since we found it to be noisy with late-night tourists and street maintenance vehicles in the wee hours of the a.m. We thought it was a bargain based upon the ratings and prices of rooms at other hotels. We won't even bother to look for another place when we go back since we were so satisfied here.

<Content>Cocktails and crostini This hotel is well positioned in the Centro Storico. It has been artfully (even wittily) created in parts of a former palazzo - presumably once the property of a White Guelph family. It is a delightful combination of antique features and modern style, and staying here is an inspiring experience in itself. Breakfast is generous and imaginative, and served in a pleasant room with high windows - altogether one of the best experiences I have had in an Italian hotel, where breakfasts are all too often dispiriting, and served without benefit of natural light. Ambience and breakfast put a spring in your step as you set out to pound the streets, galleries and churches. Front desk staff can't be faulted on helpfulness, charm and local knowledge. They also have a good shot at starting the evening in convivial fashion with cocktails and crostini, at very reasonable prices. Overall excellent value for central Florence.

<Content>An Extremely Quaint  This sweet little hotel was recommended to us by friends who have stayed there several times. The location is perfect -- within walking distance to so many beautiful piazzas and scenic areas. It is clean and very well priced. The staff on the front desk were always so helpful from recommending where to take a drivig tour through the Chianti region of Tuscany to places to eat locally.We definitely would go back and recommend it to any who travel to Florence!

<Content>Il Guelfo Bianco ..... perfezione!! Il Guelfo Bianco was an overall splendid experience. The hotel is in a prime location on Via Cavour in downtown Florence; only minutes from Il Duomo and San Lorenzo. But aside from the surrounding attractions the inside of Il Guelfo Bianco is an attraction in itself. The walls are evenly covered by important pieces of art by contemporary artists. The art works are accompanied by beautiful antique furniture that is pleasing to both the eye and the body. The rooms in the hotel are extremely cozy and were ALWAYS clean and well kept. The bathrooms are spacious and modern. My particular room had a small balcony, which was wonderful for some fresh air. I'm sure everyone is aware; traveling can be a bit stressful. The employees of Il Guelfo Bianco were so helpful my stay was virtually stress free. They were delighted to help with dinner suggestions and book reservations, set-up wine tours, map out directions, call cabs, etc, etc. The list is endless. I was delighted with my stay at Il Guelfo Bianco and will be returning to Florence and this hotel next summer.  AND A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO ANTONELLA, GIULIA, FEDERICO, DANIELE, MATTEO, MARCO AND DAL FOR THEIR KINDNESS - Grazie, Grazie!

<Content>Fine  We (spouse and I) stayed at Guelfo Bianco in early October for 4 nights. It was good! The room was spacious and opened into an inner atrium (no roof). Bathroom was fine although my wife found the shower pretty cramped; no fan BTW, the window opens for external venting. The room has a unique feature: you plug your room key into a special sensor slot when entering. This activates the lights and A/C which are all deactivated 60 sec after removing the key and leaving the room. This reduces power consumption and the tendency for guests to keep the A/C going all day. No problem for us but one guest did complain about the A/C while we were there.Breakfast was fine, good selection and a nice seating area with outdoor tables if you wanted. The hotel was running weekly food/wine tasting receptions which you can go to for 7 euros each. The service staff were really good, courteous (beyond what I would have been, after witnessing one group checking in) and helpful for local restaurant suggestions. Julie and her co-workers are to be commended.Location was outstanding - 2.5 blocks to Duomo and 1 block to Accademia. McDonald's was 20 feet from the entrance.We would definitely return.

<Content>Many reasons to like IL Guelfo Bianco Hotel If you are looking for a hotel in Florence which is centrally located (close by the Duomo), comfortable rooms, a full breakfast, and a very friendly staff, this is the hotel for you. We arrived late and needed to go to the Accademia immediately in order to make our reservation. The staff said don't worry about the car or bags - we will take care of it all and they did.

<Content>Wish I could live at Il Guelfo Bianco! The hotel il Guelfo Bianco is BEAUTIFUL! The rooms are georgeous and have a beautiful old world feel with their architecture. The staff goes above and beyond every time with any request and always makes any traveller feel at ease. Their location couldn't be more perfect with a quick walk down to the duomo and the center of firenze. If I could live here I would! I can't wait to go back! Special thanks to Daniele for helping us out with all of our reservations and questions!!!!

<Content>Absolutely Loved Il Guelfo Bianco!!!!! Il Guelfo Bianco was an amazing experience, not only was it absolutely beautiful but also the staff made you feel as if you were at home, and were also very helpful in whatever myself or my family needed!The hotel is located downtown, and it is a gorgeous old style building on an amazing street. Not only was the building nice on the outside, but it was even more beautiful in the inside, there were many paintings all around the hotel, the rooms are wonderful and VERY clean. Not to mention the breakfast there was also very delicious!!Since it was mine and my families first time in Italy, I found the staff especially helpful, they had helped us with museum reservations, gave us wonderful restaurant tips, and had also gave us tips on getting tours together!As you can see I have nothing but the best things to say about Il Guelfo Bianco!! I will recommend this hotel to anyone planning to stay in Italy!*Special Thanks to Antonella, Giulia, Federico, Daniele, Matteo, Marco, and Dal for there kindness!!!

<Content>Lovely Hotel in a Great Location We recently stayed in the Il Guelfo Bianco before and at the end of a tour of Tuscany. The rooms were large and comfortable. With clean and bright baths. The thing that made the stay so good was the staff. The people at the desk were very attentive to our requests and questions. Gave directions with suggestions and wonderful restaurant reccommendations. The location is steps away from the old city with the Duomo, etc in one direction and Michelangelo's David in the other. We had a very nice stay.

<Content>Best Hotel Ever WHAT A GREAT HOTEL!!!!! The staff was helpful, pleasant, caring and professional.The old building and the old furnishings juxtaposed with the perfect contemporary art made this the most sumptuous of hotels! Everything was well balanced and beautiful - down the bathrooms! It felt like our eyes were pampered all the time! And then the staff only added to how welcome and hospitable the place felt.

<Content>Loved Il Guelfo Bianco We loved our stay at the Il Guelfo Bianco. After booking at another hotel and knowing we could not feel safe or comfortable staying there as two young female travelers, we went on a hunt for another hotel in Florence. We visited about half a dozen hotels and looked at rooms. The Il Guelfo Bianco was by far the best out all the hotels that we saw and the rate was reasonable. We visited several 3 and 4 star hotels and we would actually put this hotel in a 4 star category (even though trip advisor listed it as a 2 star hotel, it is really rated 3 per the hotel and bookings sites such as venere). The Il Guelfo is actually much nicer than a 4 star hotel that we visited. The staff at the Il Guelfo is very welcoming providing a smile, map directions, and advice. The rooms are clean, spacious, and furnished with historically charming pieces (although I prefer modern which is hard to find in Florence). The breakfast was decent and served with a smile. The location is excellent and central within walking distance of the Doumo, Academia, and the Uffizi. I would definitely book again after seeing what else is out there in Florence. I only wish that I was here with a significant other, rather my sister as it was a charming and romantic hotel.

<Content>Il Perfecto! Just back from a 2 night stay here. Wished I had booked for longer. The hotel is in a perfect location, central but away from the throngs of tourists. 5 minute walk to Duoma and 3 minutes to markets. Our room was very spacious and beautifully appointed with historic pieces. Clean, clean clean. Hotel staff was extremely helpful with non Italian speakers (us). Definitely a highlight of our trip.

<Content>Wonderful Stay @ Guelfo Bianco This was our third visit to this wonderful hotel. As usual we booked directly with Antenella. Our experience as always was enjoyable for my wife and I. The staff is professional, efficient and very helpful. They will help you where to go whether it is for a restaurant or day trips in Florence and beautiful Tuscany. Julia at the reception helped us solving problems with the car rental company when our car broke down. The hotel is situated in the heart of the historic area of Florence which would be handy and yet reasonably quiet . The rooms are beautifully appointed and amenities in the room are up-to-date. Vallet Parking is provided.We would certainly go back as we visit Florence frequently.

<Content>Charmed by this hotel This hotel offers individual charm with constant evidence that the owners always try to do more than the minimum necessary - we would unreservedly recommend it. The location is just a few minutes' walk from the Duomo and within easy reach of the other major attractions in this City. It was also easy to find. The staff were well above average, unfailingly cheerful and genuinely keen to help. We felt like they really were pleased to see us there! We were particularly impressed with their efforts at trying to get us last minute tickets for the Uffizi Gallery. Despite it being peak time for tourists they still put in phone calls on our behalf. Their advice on places to eat was also spot on. An old building, the Hotel is decorated with a selection of contemporary art 鈥?a brave and interesting counterpoint to a City that offers much of the finest art the Renaissance has to offer. The room was a good size and the bathroom was modern and very clean. Given its central location the room was also surprisingly quiet. Our only complaint was that the bed was rather uncomfortable and would benefit from a new mattress.A definitely above average experience and we wouldn't hesitate to stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Il Guelfo Bianco was fantastic! Il Guelfo Bianco is a wonderful hotel: the rooms are gorgeous, wtih tasteful and stylish decor; the location is amazing--easy walking distance to the Duomo, the Uffizi, and the academy (where the statue of the David is); and they have valet parking. Most important of all, however, was the staff--Guilia and her co-workers are incredibly accomodating, whether helping their guests to make phone calls, find a delicious place to eat, or make reservations for the museums. I just came back from a 10 day trip throughout Italy, and Il Guelfo Bianco was the best hotel I stayed in, by far. Additionally, they will securely store your luggage after checkout, which is key to seeing the city. I definitely recommend staying here.

<Content>Terrific Hotel After having made reservations at two other hotels in Florence and reading disturbing reviews about them on tripadvisor.com, I decided to reserve a room at Il Guelfo Bianco after a family friend spent some time there in mid-July and raved about the hotel. We spent three nights at the hotel. It was a short walk from the train station, which we were able to do with little difficulty, even with two large duffel bags on wheels and two children in tow. We had one extremely large room with four beds and a beautiful bathroom. The room was the most exquisitely decorated hotel accommodation we had during our two-week Italian trip. The hotel staff was extremely helpful, especially one young woman who helped us get bus schedules to and from Siena the day before the Palio. A note to travellers who might be planning a day trip to Siena prior to the Palio on August 15, a national holiday in Italy (the Palio is held on August 16) -- buses do not run very often to and from Siena from Florence. We took a 9:10 a.m. bus to Siena but had to wait until 5:40 p.m. for the bus back to Florence. That was a long time to spend in Siena., especially with two children. It would have been ideal to get back to Florence by mid-afternoon. A large plus for us was the hotel's location a few doors away from McDonald's, where we spent a lot of time. Because of my 10-year-old son's picky eating habits, we would get him his daily dose of Chicken McNuggets for dinner and then the rest of us would have dinner at a nice restaurant, while he would sit there sipping his $4 Coke. The hotel was very close to Michelangelo's David, and because we reserved tickets ahead of time, there was hardly a wait to get in. One downside to Florence was the crowds, but we managed to escape the hordes of tourists by exploring less crowded areas of the city. A highlight for us was a tour of the Synagogue, which like the rest of the city, is absolutely beautiful. Breakfast was good, nothing special. We had the choice of eating inside or outside. There is an outdoor flea market very close to the hotel, where all sorts of leather goods and other souvenirs can be purchased. Some of the stalls were part of established stores selling quality leather products while others were just stalls selling knock-off purses. So, buyer beware. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Florence.

<Content>Great Location My friend and I just spent three nights in Florence and this hotel was a great location in the city! We were able to walk to all of the highlights of the city that we wanted and also to some very good local restaurants.It was a very clean and exceptionally large room with little extras such as a second TV with two chairs/beds if you had two others needing beds sharing the room.We were on the second floor over the street, but since there was double sets of windows it did not disturb our sleep from noise on the street.The price is very reasonable for this kind of accommodation so centrally located.Thank you to other hotel guests who wrote Trip Advisor reviews as this is what sold the hotel for us and was definitely a great find!

<Content>Amazing hotel Rooms are amazing - high ceilings and decorated in a 15C style. The bathroom was enormous. Breakfast was good - cheese, bread, cereals, fruit - the normal european hotel breakie. Very close to all the sites - walking distance. It is on a busy road, so best to try and get a room on a higher level. Our room faced the road (with the windows closed the sound is very muffled, except for the odd occasion) however in walking around the hotel we came across other rooms that looked out into internal patios which would be better - one room looked like it had its own balcony - that would of been great!Internet is expensive at the hotel - best to use the numerous internet places near the hotel. The hotel staff organised a personal wine tour for us - great recommendation and well organised. Reception also booked tickets for us for the academia with no problems.Whilst we were there they had 2 different ladies on reception - their service was exceptional. On one occassion there was a man, who wasn't very personable - a bit abrupt and rude. However the rest of the staff were great - especially the 2 other ladies on reception. This hotel is decorated beautifully and is such a nice haven to return to after the busy pace of florence. We really liked this hotel and would recommend staying there - if we ever go back to Florence, it will be to stay here again.

<Content>Perfecto!  I stayed here last May and had such a wonderful experience with this hotel. In my opinion, it was the best hotel I stayed at in Italy. The room and hotel itself is absolutely beautiful and the location couldn't be any better. The breakfast they serve everything morning was delicious, a true Italian treat. The staff was extremely kind and helpful. They helped me with booking the tours I wanted and suggested the best restaurants to dine at. If you want to have a fabulous time in Florence, Italy, as I did, I highly recomment staying at Il Guelfo Bianco, you won't regret it!

<Content>Perfect Hotel in Florence!!! This hotel is truly a gem in Florence. I was looking for a nice place that had all of the typical amenities of a hotel and was so pleasantly surprised by how welcoming and friendly the staff was. The room was so cute and perfect. Daniele made my stay in Florence a memorable one and truly provided remarkable service. He gave us the best spots and restaurant recommendations that were spot on for what we were looking for. I can't wait to come back to Florence and stay at Il Guelfo Bianco again. Ciao!

<Content>Pure delight My family and I recently visited Il Guelfo Bianco (mid-June 2007). It was a perfect blend of a quaint and comfortable property, extremely friendly and helpful staff, and fantastic location. A few minutes from the Duomo one can hardly do better. The rooms were comfortable and nicely decorated. Everyone working there seemed truly to care about the guests.I could not recommend this place more highly. I wish that I could have stayed for a week or more.

<Content>great service, great room, impeccable ! I often travel to Italy, especially to Florence. Therefore I have stayed at quite many hotels in the past. This time, I stayed at il guelfo bianco for the first time, and I have to say that it was the most wonderful stay for me ever! The first room that I was provided did not have a bath tub, which is totally fine to many people, but to me, I really wanted to stay in a room with a nice bath tub so that I could relax at the end of the day. Well, I went to talk to the receptionist at front, and they were all very understanding. They immediately checked the vacancy and gave me a different room with a great, spacy bathroom. The rest of the room was great as well.I also needed many help for directions of the places that I had to go, and the people who work there always helped me to give me a direction. They also wrote down the places in Florence that I should not miss, including the restaurants that are not in the guidebook. They were absolutely kind. I always have a great, wonderful time in Italy and if I need help, the Italian people always help me. Among all the experiences in Toscana, they been so far the best people with great service to me.  I understand that we all have accidents or problems occasionaly from time to time. This hotel that I thought to be one of the best might not be the best to certain people, however, to me, as I travel so much all the year around, I have to stay that they really made my stay enjoyable. I would definitely like to go back to Il Guelfo Bianco again in the future. Yuki Nakanoin New York

<Content>Sweet spot in Florence We were absolutely delighted with this hotel. The favorable comments from other reviews are spot on. We got room 108, which is huge and quiet, furnished with lovely antique furniture and modern art, and overlooks the courtyard. It is a bit more expensive than the basic rate (e275) but worth it. The first floor is particularly nice because there is a balcony overlooking the courtyard where you can have a smoke or a snack and catch some sun in the afternoon after a big lunch. If there is any problem with the hotel it is that housekeeping is not always perfect. There was wet towel on the bathroom floor when we arrived and the ashtrays on the balcony were not emptied every day. However, we plan to stay here next time we visit Florence, and would happily stay longer than the three days we stayed in Florence on this trip.

<Content>Great Hotel, ideal location We have just returned (1st June) from our first trip to Florence and our stay at the Il Guelfo Bianco. Having travelled a great deal and stayed in a variety of grades of hotel, this hotel fits the bill for those who want good value for money, with all the necessary boxes ticked.We travelled to Pisa and caught the train to Florence. It took around 90 minutes and cost 10 euros for 2 singles.Hotel location: Excellent. Florence is so easy to get around and navigate. We used a map once and that was on the first night to find out hotel from the train station. Minutes from the Duomo, main shopping streets, the Arno. Also 5 minutes from Saint Marco square, where the No 7 bus takes you to Fiesole, the town above Florence. 30 minutes on the bus for about 4 euros return for two people, buy your ticket from the tabac where the buses stop. The views are spectacular and a little cooler than Florence in the really hot weatherFacilities: Very good. Our room was on the 4th floor, facing the busy street of Via Cavour. The windows are tripled glazed and we slept really well. Another writer commented that the beds were hard, we didn't find this to be a problem. Extra blanket and pillows are available. The bathrooms, if not particularly spacious are clean, well lit and have great water pressure. The maid service was excellent and having the Sky TV with some english speaking programmes was a bonus when getting ready to go out. My only comment would be, as with so many hotels hairdryers in bathrooms are usually pretty useless - so ladies if you don't want frizzy hair, I recommend you take your own with an adaptor.Also, it would have been good to have tea and coffee making facilities, but again not a major problem.Breakfast was adequate, enough to keep you going until your first cappuccino stop of the day.Staff: Very helpful and courteous. The front desk usually appeared to be a bit manic, with only one person on it at a time, but it didn't particularly affect us - so if you are ringing to make a reservation be prepared to be put on hold, email may be a better option.Eating out: We could not believe how many good quality restaurants were close to the hotel. Via Guelfo, (left out of hotel and first left) if you are patient, the street reveals numerous trattorias hidden between the internet cafes - well worth a look. We ate twice at i' tozzo...di pane.., at number 94. Friendly staff, great food, outside eating area and jazz. Word of warning, be careful if a restauranteur offers specials which are not on the menu, it can be expensiveGreat city - good shopping and the hotel is a good place to stay.If we return to Florence, we shall return to the Guelfo BiancoDiane and Andrew, Knaresborough, England

<Content>Clean room with nice bathroom The hotel had a lot of character, but I found our room to be dark. The ceilings were dark wood .. and it rained our entire visit, so the rooms appeared very dark with poor lighting. I also found some of the staff friendlier than others. Whenever I went to ask a question at the front desk, they were usually busy on the phone and I felt like I was interrupting. I asked for restaurant recommendations and didn't get any specific restaurant. The answer was they all were good. To be honest, I wasn't crazy about the location. It was in a downtown area that seemed a bit isolated late at night. Although you could walk everywhere, I would have preferred to be closer to the Arno River. The beds were very hard and low to the ground. It was nice to hear church bells nearby. The breakfast was fine and satisfying. Florence is a wonderful city. We had one excellent meal there at a restaurant called Cellistino's. Across the river near the Ponte Vecchio. The locals are very familiar with it.

<Content>"Il Guelfo Bianco": an experience to live For me Florence was always a dreamy destination and when I decided to visit it I wanted to organize it in such a way in order to enjoy every minute of my days there. Since I believe that the environment we live in, even for a few days, is very important to our whole mood, I knew that the hotel I would choose would have to be something special and something equivalent to the beauty of the city I was going to visit. Il Guelfo Bianco: the name itself is mysterious and unusual. It follows the history of the city. Located in the centre of the city, I could just step out of the hotel and find myself directly in the heart of Florence. The entrance of the hotel and the reception can be misleading: they are rather small compared to what one would expect. But when you visit the other spaces of the hotel and the rooms, you get the feeling you have entered in a fairytale. Warm colors are everywhere, wood is everywhere, the old and reserved furniture takes you years back in the history. You feel relaxed before even using your comfort bed and hotel amenities. You cannot believe it that a few minutes ago you were in one of the busiest streets of the city! Take a moment and enjoy your cappuccino in the quiet room specifically made for you to read or to relax before or after a day full of walking! When you start talking to the people working there, the dream continues to fulfill! Those guys there have everything set up for you before you even ask for it! Believe me when I say that the smile I saw (from the hotel鈥檚 maids to the hotel鈥檚 manager) was a real one. Even if you have not organized anything, even if you have no clue on what to see and visit in Florence, they will prepare for you a program matching your days of staying, your needs, your desires. And believe me, they will be 100% correct on all their suggestions! They are not there just to work, they know every small corner of Florence and they want their visitors to discover the city鈥檚 beauties. I do hope to be able to stay at the 鈥淕uelfo Bianco鈥?very soon, because it is not just another hotel, it is an experience worth having鈥?br/>Ada TzetouAthens, Greece

<Content>Great Experience We stayed at Il Guelfo Bianco for three nights last week. Our room was well appointed and comfortable. The staff was very helpful from check in to check out. The hotel is in a great location, a few blocks from the Duomo. It is located on a very busy street, which our room faced, but the windows blocked out the noise sufficiently for us. The breakfast was great, just enough to get you started on your day of touring. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Just perfect! When I booked the hotel through the website I had high expectations as it looked just so renaissance but I was still pleasantly surprised by how beautiful everything really was. The staff is very nice and friendly and they give great restaurant suggestions. If I go back to Florence, I won't even search for another hotel... I'll make sure I get a booking here!

<Content>NOT a Holiday Inn! We stayed here for three nights in early March. The first impression was, Wow! Our final impression, upon leaving, was likewise, Wow! This place, in short, is not some non-descript chain hotel. It had real character, with very thoughtful furnishings both inside the rooms and in the hallways. And the rooms themselves are quite a treat, with fourteen-foot carved ceilings and other touches. You feel like you are staying in a very special place, almost like going back in time, but with electricity and hot water. After our first night, we needed to change rooms since a firend was coming to town to visit and, hence, we needed three beds. We were able to see three other rooms in order to pick one, and each one was special, and each one was different.The hotel is on Via Cavour, which is a busy street. The windows are triple paned which cut down on road noise quite a bit. But if you are a very light sleeper, you should ask for a room facing the interior courtyard.Breakfast was very good and the staff were all very pleasant. We paid off-season rates (175 Euro/night, when there were three of us) and I felt it was a great deal. The other hotels on our trip were of a similar cost but not a one of them could match Il Guelfo Bianco in terms of the total experience. I would stay here again without thinking twice!

<Content>Absolutely perfect! We stayed for three nights and totally enjoyed ourselves. The room was large and beautifully decorated. Large bathroom with sumptious tub. Amazing artwork throughout the hotel. Breakfast was very good by Italian standards. The hotel staff provided excellent service! They know excellent restaurants, including little-known Tuscan hideaways. At this price I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Florence!

The staff gave us great restaurant recommendations as well (and helped with reservations). Can't wait to go there again.

<Content>"Such a Nice Experience" What a wonderful place! I'm not sure how the star rating system works, but we couldn't figure out why this only gets two stars. This was the first of four hotels we stayed at on our honeymoon, and it turned out to be the nicest experience at the most reasonable rate. Every single staff member we encountered was genuinely pleasant and helpful, including waitstaff and maidservice. They booked advance tickets for us at the Ufizzi, called cabs, recommended places, etc. The breakfast was cheerful though not extravagant and the espresso and cappucino were made to order - no self-service machine stuff. We purchased a great bottle of wine from their bar and they didn't gouge us on the price like most other hotels. The internet access was reasonable and available. The rooms were always clean, the bathroom was spacious, modern, and comfortable, and the technology (LCD TV, lights, climate control, etc) was contemporary and pleasantly in contrast with the vintage furnishings. You can walk to the hotel from the train station but don't bother if you've got big, unwieldy luggage because the streets are narrow and the sidewalks narrower. You can spend a lot more money at another hotel and get a lot less. If you're into big hotel lobbies with a lot of action, this place is probably not for you - it's a little more intimate, although by no means stuffy. We emailed a few questions to them before booking and the replies were quick and informative. Their website was great and the availability/reservation tools worked without a hitch. We will definitely return someday and bring some friends with us.

<Content>A Perfect Gem! We stayed at this charming hotel in the Heart of Florence. Il Guelfo Bianco is located within walking distance to everything imaginable. What made our stay such a rewarding experience was the very warm and helpful staff!The staff at Il Guelfo Bianco were very accomodating. They would take care of everything including dinner reservations, tickets to events, knowing the train schedules, etc., etc.I truly could not have experienced the true flavor of this city without their knowledge and reccomondations of the local places to shop and eat, that were off the beaten path. I felt at home and taken care of.I would stay here again in a Heartbeat!Ciao,KathyCalifornia

<Content>the best hotel in Florence I stayed at the Guelfo Bianco Hotel a few days ago and i must say that it was the best place i have ever stayed in Italy. I met the name of this hotel accidentally when looking on internet for a place to stay in Florence. I must say that the description and photos of the hotel that i found on their site gave me the idea of a peaceful and very comfortable place. But, when I reached the hotel I realised that the idea i had of it was only a small part of the reality i met there. First of all the staff was very very friendly and helpful, the room was quiet and very comfortable, i strongly recommand room 111, a gracious room with a garden view, the price was excellent, and the cleaning staff very efficient. I just loved the music i was hearing during the breakfast, and when i asked the people of the staff about it they told me that they have special CD's dedicated to the care of their clients. I certainly WILL come back to the Guelfo Bianco and I hope that this will be possible once or twice a year, given the fact that my husband just started a bussines with an italian company.

<Content>Great Hotel The hotel is situated in a great location; convenient for the city centre attractions as well as transport links.The staff are very friendly and very helpful. In particular recommendations for places to eat have been the best I have experienced and I discovered some very good restaurants in the vicinity.The hotel is very tastefully decorated, clean, well maintained and the rooms are spacious compared to some in Itay. They are also fitted and furnished to a high standard. Overall it was a good experience in a wonderful city. I would recommend the hotel on the basis of location alone but allied with the staff and quality of the rooms it a very attractive option for a trip to Florence.

<Author>crazycross
<Content>dissapointed Myself and two friends stayed in this hotel for 2 nights last weekend. I think I must have built up my expectations too high when reading the reviews on this site.ROOM - I had asked for a non-smoking room, but the one we received stank of cigar smoke. The room was large and to the back of the hotel as requested, therefore very quiet. However, the room had no natural light coming in and was very dark and the carpet was quite stained. On a plus side, the bathroom was lovely and had a great shower.BREAKFAST - probably the worst breakfast we have had in a hotel. Very poor choice, and extra charge for fresh fruit salad (although it did have a notice up telling you this). I have been to Pisa, Rome and Milan - all much better breakfasts. STAFF - The staff were mostly helpful and recommend a great restaurant for the Saturday night. But on check-out, we were charged 290 euros per night and not 260 euros as booked through hotels.com. The woman said, very aggressively, that we would have to take it up with them. I felt quite intimidated by her reaction.LOCATION - the location was ideal, not too far from anywhere.FLORENCE - WONDERFUL !I wouldn't go back to this hotel - we paid more than our original budget, because we thought we were getting something special - but we didn't!

<Content>Room at the Back We stayed for three nights and were very impressed with this hotel. We were given Room 228, a very large double, with a separate seating area and beautiful wooden trellised ceiling. The bathroom was good - the shower was powerful, and the screen was solid rather than a clammy curtain. Everything was really clean. The bed was very big, two three foot singles pushed together as is normal in Italy. What distinguishes the hotel is the staff, who were great, and the owner's collection of modern art; original and beautiful artworks are in your room and throughout the hotel. Breakfast was fine - a self service buffet of boiled eggs, cereals, bread, croissants and fruit salad at extra charge. My only criticism is the street noise - we closed the shutters but could still hear traffic from the very busy via Cavour. However we got used to it by the third day, and if you had a higher floor I am sure it would be better. The location was good - we were five minutes walk from the Duomo and about 12 minutes from the Ponte Vecchio.

<Author>attytrav.
<Content>excellent location but loud street noise I stayed at Il Guelfo Bianco twice in September 2006. I stayed in room 339 for 3 nights and then in 102 for one. Room 339 was a great room, virtually a suite with a very nice bathroom. Room 102 was much smaller but still fine for one person. My one complaint is that both of the rooms were on Via Cavour, which is a very loud street. Even the double windows did not block out the noise. I would recommend that if you are noise sensitive at all that you either bring earplugs or make sure you stay in a room not on the street. The hotel's location is fantastic and staff was fine (although allegedly made dinner reservations at a restaurant that was closed that night and never bothered to tell us). I think I would stay here again as long as I got a back room.

<Content>Loved this small, well-cared for Hotel We recently returned from a trip to Italy and one of the highlights of our travels was our stay at the Hotel Il Guelfo Bianco - it was all any traveler could want in a small hotel. The staff was friendly, courteous, went out of their way to offer restaurant advice, tour advice. Antonella even went so far as to reserve space at The Last Supper in Milan for us - made all our resevations for everything from a private trip to The Mall to viewing David and the Uffizi. Nolen gave us restaurant advice that led us to places we would never have discovered on our own and were rewarded with wonderful food and great service. Alessio was ever-friendly and even repaired a damaged suitcase - going out of his way to help make certain we could continue traveling with it! The breakfast was good, the hotel was quiet, clean and very well-cared for - it was updated with all the modern conveniences without losing any of the appeal of being in a historic building. I would recommend staying here for anyone who is looking for a smaller hotel but still really wants something nice! Did I mention that the location was superb - steps away from the Duomo and The Academy (the David) and close to every shopping spot you could want in Florence.

<Content>Very cute! My husband and I spent 3 nights in this hotel. The staff were helpful with recomendations of restaurants, tours etc. We needed our laundry done and the hotel does not priovide this service during weekends so we had to do it ourselves in a laundromat down the road. The location is great, we did not catch any taxis during our entire stay. I booked through their website in advance and got a great internet deal. The room was quite roomy, very clean and the decor extremely nice. Breakfast was sufficient to get you going for the morning, Tuscan food is great so I wouldn't bother getting full on breakfast. A tip - the tourist info centre is on the same street, we reserved entry to the museams through here and avoided lining up for 3 hours, it took us 5 minutes instead! Would definately stay here again.

<Content>Lovely boutique hotel This is a very nice boutique hotel located on the historic Via Cavour in the heart of Florence, one block from the Accademie Museum (David) and a few blocks from the Duomo. The common areas are open and welcoming, with antique furnishings, and the rooms are large and very accommodating. The bathroom was one of the nicest we had during our two week stay in Italy. The staff was very helpful, especially when we had left our passports at our previous hotel in Rome and they made arrangements to have them sent to us via Federal Express. The breakfast was very ample and the breakfast room and patio were very inviting. The person who said there was no elevator must have stayed at a different hotel, because this hotel definitely has a working elevator. Overall this was a pleasant experience, and we would recommend the Il Guelfo Bianco to anyone.

<Content>We Absolutely Loved this hotel! I just returned from a trip to Italy. I took my 70 yr. old mother on her first trip to Europe along with some friends. We all absolutely LOVED this hotel. The location is extremely convenient to everything you'll want to see in Florence. The staff could not have been more helpful and all spoke excellent English. The rooms were all unique and really beautiful. The building is a renovated historic building. The bathrooms are all completely new and modern. The ceilings feature beautiful dark wooden beams. The windows all have lovely thick wooden shutters. I can't say enough about the hotel. Our absolute favorite hotel of this trip. I would most definitely recomment this hotel and would absolutely stay here again.

<Content>Decent Value for the Money This hotel met our needs pretty well for a trip to Florence in early January 2005. Perhaps its best facet is its location, which is right on Via Cavour right in the historic heart of the city. While we weren't terribly impressed with either the service by the head concierge (to their credit, only the head receptionist was a little snippy- the others were very nice and helpful)or the room itself (which was a little small and ratty), the hotel's general amenities, decor and food service were more than well done for a small establishment. Be warned that the walkways and stairs are very tiny so its not advisable for travelers used to large spaces. The hotel also came in toward the bottom end of the very steep Italian hotel rates, making it a pretty good value for the money.

<Content>It's ok, but I think you can find better My fiance and I stayed here for 2 nights. The location is fabulous, totally walking distance to everything. If you have a car, it will cost 24 Euros a day to park it. We had a room were we had to walk up winding staircases to the 3rd floor (no elevator). The front desk could not help us with our luggage. Be careful what you take at the breakfest buffet. Some items are not included in your stay and they will charge you for them when you checkout. (although they will not tell you while you are eating)In my opinion, you could stay somewhere better at the same price.

<Content>Fabulous place in Florence My sister and I spent seven days at IlGuelfoBianco in Florence and wish it had been longer. The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Their information on the sights of Florence was very accurate and they did not hesitate to make helpful suggestions.The rooms are beautifully restored with historical furniture. We felt that we found our home away from home.

<Content>A little gem in the heart of Florence Lovely hotel on an excellent location, the dome is only two minutes walking away, rooms are beautifully decorated and the bathrooms are great.Very considerate staff. They even have umbrella's at the reception desk for their guests in case it rains (well it happened to me on my last day in Florence). Would certainly stay there again.And for those who may have doubts about going to Florence, it's a wonderful lively town, I loved it !

<Content>Great place to stay in Florence This was the first hotel of 5 different ones during our trip to Italy. Great location and an easy walk to the Duomo, not cheap, but then nothing in the large cities is cheap. The staff was always helpful and our room was large and quite lovely. Breakfast each morning was great. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>love this hotel and city My family and I stayed here for 8 nights. Charming, lovely hotel. Since we had a few rooms, it was fun to just compare rooms (every room is different). The staff were so friendly and helpful. My mom got sick and they called a doctor, he got there in 10 minutes. The location is perfect, the breakfast so so. But that wasn't really important to us, the food in FLorence is great, so don't waste your appetite on breakfast. Lovely city. Will definitely go back and stay in this hotel! Reasonable prices too.

<Content>Lovely Il Guelfo Bianco! We loved it here! The service was excellent, the room was beautiful (as well as the bathroom!) and the location was great. The hotel has little hidden balconies all over that you can order room service and take you food out to, or just sit out there at the end of a long day of walking. Within easy walking distance of all attractions, but on a nice quiet street. Huge stained glass casement windows were wonderful, as well as 15 foot or so cielings. My mother had a back injury while we were staying here, and the hotel got a wonderful doctor to come see her within the hour. They were extremely helpful and I would definitely stay here again.

This isn't just a nice, comfortable place to spend your vacation in Florence: this is a way to fully immerse yourself into the Florence of the Reinassance... The hotel is wonderful, the staff has all traits of what you think Italian hospitality should be! Warm, welcoming, fun and full of helpful advice! I will go back!

<Content>Truly Charming, Great location! My wife and I just returned from our trip. The Guelfo Bianco is a wonderful Hotel, within walking distance to everything and with a very helpful and friendly staff (our first night they recommended The Perseus restaurant, an amazing place!) We had a Superior Deluxe room on the third floor with windows that faced the street. The windows were double cased and the room was quiet. The building is 500 years old and at night we heard many unusual sounds inside the room. When I inquired at the front desk the next evening the night clerk got very scared actually accusing me of trying to scare her (I wasn't, just asking questions.) But everyone else was accommodating and the place is wonderful.

<Content>Centralize Place It was a really cute place in a centralized location, down the block from the Duomo and the many shops and restaurants and a few blocks from the Accademia with Michaelangelo's David. The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming which is exactly what you need after the adventure getting there. It is very difficult finding the street, let alone the place by car so make sure to get there before sunset.

<Content>Highly Recommend What a wonderful place. The staff were so helpful. We had come from Rome and had no reservations. They were negotiable on the room rate, and very helpful... The rooms are sparkling clean and roomy. The breakfast had a lot of selection and the staff could not have been nicer. It is in a wonderful location, near the heart of everything, and moments away from ...David. What could be better. I would stay here again in a second.

<Content>3 Star Prices With 4 Star Ambiance We stayed at Hotel Il Guelfo Bianco for several days beginning 10/1/04. The other four hotels on this trip were 4 star and we were shocked to learn that this hotel only has 3 stars. We had by far the largest room of any of our hotels and it included a couch and a window overlooking a garden. The furnishings were very tasteful and the beautiful old hallways were a gallery of very interesting contemporary art. The location is awesome (one block from David at the Academy) and the front desk was very helpful. They are a bit less formal than other hotels at this level and perhaps some people are disconcerted by that. Despite what others have said, the breakfast was fine, although we had to pay a bit extra for the excellent fruit salad.

<Content>Great hotel, highly recommended We stayed here for 6 nights is March 2004. The room was large with decorated wood beam ceilings and an incredibly huge and modern bathroom.The staff was very helpful with restaurant recommendations and directions. This hotel is centrally located, very near the Duomo. It is on a busy street but we never heard any street noise.As others have said here, the breakfast is ordinary and they charge you extra for fruit salad and ham, but there is enough variety to get you started for your day ahead.I would highly recommend this hotel and I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Excellent location, rooms and staff.. My husband and I stayed here May 6, 2004 for two nights. The hotel is very centrally located and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful large room (#226) and I asked to see some of the other rooms. All the rooms are different and all uniquely decorated. Most of the rooms are quite large. It is a perfect hotel for people traveling with children because several of the rooms are so large that they can easily accomodate 2 adults and 2 children, or even 4 adults. There would even be room for a roll away. For European rooms, they are very large. Even the standard rooms are of OK size. As for the breakfast, it wasn't the best I have ever had, but it certainly was adequate. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Great hotel Recently spent part of my honeymoon in Florence and stayed at this charming hotel. The staff is very helpful, although a bit scattered at times. Their restuarant, shopping suggestions proved extremely useful, although they are short on conversation! We stayed in a Superior Double and it was a beautiful, large room with separate sitting area and a fantastic fresco on the ceiling. Even though we were on the street side the double windows kept the street noise out. The location couldn't be better! I agree that the breakfast isn't anything to write home about. You're better off grabbing a espresso and a pannini at one of the local bars situated close by. All in all one of my favorite hotels in Europe and I look forward to returning there soon.
