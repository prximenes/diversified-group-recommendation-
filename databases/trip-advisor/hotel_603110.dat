<Content>Hong Kong Gem My wife and I spent 5 nights last week at the Lan Kwai Fong Hotel and found it a delightful experience. We had a harbour view room on the 23rd floor and whereas the view is not unobstructed there is still plenty to see on the water and across to Kowloon on the other side. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful from those at the front desk, to the breakfast room staff and the nice lady who cleaned our room every morning while we were at breakfast. Speaking of breakfast it was very good. Served until 11am. Good variety including freshly made omelettes to order and good quality tea and coffee. We had never been in Hong Kong before but enjoyed it immensely. Lovely friendly people, efficient and cheap public transport and a sense of feeling very safe even walking around at night. The hotel is in a great location very handy for most things, including shops and restaurants, while still quiet at night. A 10 minute walk to the Star Ferry via the elevated walkway. Slightly shorter via the same route to the main bus terminus and also near to Central MTR (metro). Two suggested trips. Lantau Island, MTR from Central to Tung Chung (end of line) and cable car to the biggest statue of a sitting Buddah in the world (apparently). Worth the trip but there may be a long queue (an hour or more at weekends) for the cable car. If there is a significant queue for the return trip suggest you get the nearby 23 bus which brings you back down to the MTR station. Another trip we enjoyed was by bus to Stanley which is a nice seaside town on the other side of Hong Kong Island. Get the number 6 (not the 6X) at the central bus terminus in HK and if possible try to get the front seat on the top deck. Lovely scenic drive around the island to Stanley taking about 45 minutes and all for less than 1 Euro equivalent. Nice place for a stroll with quite a good market. Also back in HK dont miss the trip to the peak on the peak tram (sit on the right). To get to the tram turn right up Abberdeen Street as you come out of the hotel and walk up on to Hollywood Road. Turn left and keep walking straight on. You will eventually see signs for the Peak Tram. About 10/15 min walk from the hotel. Lovely views and walks around the top. We will definitely go back to Hong Kong and look forward to meeting again all the friendly staff at the Lan Kwai Fong Hotel.

<Content>Great location Stayed here as part of a deal package so didn't really choose the hotel, but it was fine.Great location and decent clean room. Shoe boxed sized, but guess most hotel rooms in Hong Kong are small.

<Content>Good hotel in a great location This was a good average price hotel. The rooms are small but that is normal for Hong Kong as land is expensive. The location is great to see the sites of Central Hong Kong and the main shopping areas. From this location you are close to the funicular railway which takes you to the top of Victoria peak which has the best views of the city and harbor.

<Content>HK delight We wanted a good quality hotel for our 2 night stay in HK at the end of our hectic trip back to the UK. Though by far not the cheapest hotel on HK island most definitely the best value for money in a very central location. Easy access to ferries, markets, tram and shopping. The room was gorgeous, lovely view, lovely decor and very comfortable bed. The staff were fantastic. They organised a great baby cot for my 1 year old and were attentive to my husband and I without being intrusive. My son loved the staff and they were so friendly to him, we felt so welcome. The place has a great little dining area, not the biggest menu but good food and drinks, again the staff were lovely. One member of staff we have to mention in particular was Angela Mak, the guest services manager. She was fantastic, really made the stay for us. It is not always easy travelling with a toddler especially to a more upmarket hotel, but she made us feel right at home and ensured we had everything we needed. Thank you so much Angela. If you want a good place to stay, in central HK and if you can splash out a little, book a superior room in this hotel, it is a lovely recluse in a busy, busy city and it ensures you make the most of your trip to HK. What can I say...... a cat 9 thypoon hit HK whilst we were there and they ensured our safety and we still had a fantastic time. Well done guys!

<Content>Swish  This is a chic, clean  modern hotel, centrally located, with oriental decor throughout. The boys on the desk were very welcoming, helpful  friendly (bless them), as were the staff in the bar  restaurant. The rooms are compact, but have a very luxurious feel; ours had a harbour view which was stunning day  night. The hotel is located in SOHO, which is a cool  happening area just south of Central Station, which has plenty of great bars, restaurants  shops, as well as the antiques market. Behind you the hills with the zoo  botanical gardens  The Peak, below you the bustle of Central  the Piers. Less than a five minute walk to the trams, this is a great hotel in a fantastic location.

<Content>Great Hotel With Beautiful Oriental Touches Visited Hong Kong last month and stayed at a hotel called Lan Kwai Fong @ Kau E Fong. It is a boutique hotel with Oriental touches throughout all its d茅cor and settings. Reasonably priced, clean and the employees were very hospitable. This boutique hotel should not be confused with LKF Hotel that is located in Chung Wan. The latter hotel is the one that is located in the hype location of Lan Kwai Fong itself whereas the former is at Sheung Wan, Kau E Fong but it seems both hotels have the same name in Cantonese i.e. Lan Kwai Fong. Had a tough time trying to explain to all the Taxi Drivers to get me to the right hotel as majority of them is much better acquainted with the LKF Hotel in Chung Wan.Ask for high floor rooms in particular harbour view to get a beautiful night Hong Kong view and while you are there, dropped by a Dim Sum Cha Lau called Lin Heung in which is located just a stone throw away from this hotel to exprience some real traditional good old days Cha Lau style as this restaurant has about 80 years old history serving Dim Sum and some other popular dishes.

<Content>perfect for overnight If you stay only for one or two night in HK this hotel is a very good choice. Central location, just by the antiques's street (my favorite spot in Hong Kong). The staff welcomes you in a kindly way, are quick - wich helps! - and efficent. Rooms are really tiny little, but accurate and clean. Anyway if you stay all day out around, the size of the room is not a priority. Bathroom need to be mentioned, they are small but they are really a little trasure of design and style. the breakfast is set in a nice terrace, with a cool and detailed atmosphere. A nice cozy hotel for a very reasonable price. For a longer stay in Hong Kong probably you go at Peninsula (10 time more expensive) but for if we will overnight again in HK we will come back.

<Content>Small rooms but perfectly formed This hotel is tucked away in the old part of Central, surrounded by low rise traditional Hong Kong buildings and street markets and steps away from the mid-level escalotor and five minutes walk from SoHo. I had a warm and professional welcome on arrival and was helped with a map and directions for my explorations. I had a standard double room, which was very compact, but had been cleverly designed so that you had everything you needed. The modern oriental style has certainly more character than a faceless Novotel box available for a similar price. A real treat are the bathrooms with micro-pebble tiles, bamboo ladder towel rail etc. To save any problems with Taxis finding the hotel make sure you tell them it is on the corner of Aberdeen Street and Kau U Fong - as the former is the bigger street and more well known than the latter which is the hotel's official address.

<Content>Lang Kwai Fong with much to offer On Hong Kong Island, the Lang Kwai Fong is superbly situated for exploring all aspects of this fascinating city. The wet market is only metres away, Queen's Road a two minute walk, restaurants and bars abound in the vicinity. The rooms are immaculately well presented, and by Hong Kong standards are a good size. The staff couldn't be more helpful and are very keen to ensure that all your needs are met. I really enjoyed my stay here, and it soon became home - a great place from which to explore Hong Kong - and be comfortable. I would come back here any time.

<Content>Spot on Hotel in a great location Arrived late and exhausted in Hong Kong without having booked a Hotel and after getting to Central Hong Kong was kindy pointed in the direction of the Lan Kwai Hotel by the staff at the Four Seasons.The staff at Lan Kwai were very friendly and helpful throughout, the room was a double on the 30th floor (and as previously mentioned was on the small side) but the decor was smart and I got plenty of hot water from the sunflower shower day and night. Views were hampered by the clouds but it was at the end of typhoon season. The location is spot on with everything from authentic chinese to chic cosmopolitan bars within easy access.This was my first time in Hong Kong and I was so happy to find i'd ended up in such a decently priced, smart and well positioned Hotel.

<Content>Mistake but not too bad I mistook this hotel for the LKF by Rhombus which a friend had recommended. But it was only for 2 nights, so I stuck by the reservation.The twin room was tiny but clean. Overall, It wasn't too bad but not worth what we paid. Quiet location, very near a superb roast duck noodle cafe and some quaint lil boutiques where i completely blew my shopping budget for the year.

<Content>veary bad hotel not a 4 star in anyway THe pictures of the hotel on the wesite do not show actual size. Hotel rooms are very very small and u cannot fit more than one big bag. THe location near lan kwai fong is a plus but taking taxi costs u a lot and thier shuttle bus runs only after one hour so u only have to take a taxi.Over all experience with wife very bad. Not recommeneded wud never stay there again

<Content>Great location, good value for HK Would have given the hotel a higher rating were it not for the fact that we were accused on arrival of being a day late and were told we would have to pay for the no show. Luckily I had kept all my e-mail correspondence with the hotel and it was a mistake on their part. Other than this and a lingering smell of cigarette smoke outside our room everything here worked fine. Good value for a HK hotel and this must be about the best area one could stay on the island - wlking distance of almost everything. The rooms were clean and everything worked. We got a better rate from the hotel direct than we got from agents - but dont pay for breakfast - many local restaurants and cafes nearby at a fraction of the price.

<Content>a REAL dump this hotel is a real dump...freezing cold in room: we were told they were out of heaters, note hotel staff are all wearing scarves in hotel, we were offered a blanket, when I said I do not spend my whole time in the room in bed I was met with a staresmelly: the air smelled like fried foodbed very uncomfortable= horrible sleepstaff friendly on check in then could care less, when we said we were checking out a day early (out of two days) they did not say they were sorry but only that we may be charged for the second night and there was nothing the manager could doview: we paid for a harbor view room, if you get stuck in this dump pay for a city view, you only get a sliver of the harbor anyway and the windows are so dirty it does not matterdirty: dirty bathroom, carpets, you name it, fake designer touches, shower curtain that is too long and takes over half the tub is a nice touchbest part of it all was the internet was BROKEN so we were advised after one hour of confusion, on a business day when I was trying to get messages out before leaving for the day to GO TO AN INTERNET CAFE, But it was only 5 minutes away! great idea, and nice how they tried to charge us for the internet when we were checking out 15 minutes after being told this! the internet is still broken but we need special manager approval not to charge you! what a real dump, this was far worse than any backpacker bungalow I ever stayed in and only 100x the cost! avoid it!

<Content>a touch of home We had decided tot celebrate New Year's Eve in Hong Kong and had already booked a room in the Lan Kwai Fong Hotel when we read the negative hotel reviews on Trip Advisor. We were extremely worried about what to find upon arrival, especially the (lack of) hygiene caused me sleepless nights.But I needn't have worried.We loved staying at this hotel. When we arrived, we were given an upgrade to a harbour view room on the 27th floor. Great view , especially at night. The room was not too big, but very cosy and very clean (even bathrobes and slippers were changed every day). We did like the oriental style.The staff was very young and very friendly and so helpful. They all did their very best to give you this particular feeling of being welcome, of feeling at home.We 'd definitely go back to this hotel.

<Content>Great experience Loved this hotel, one of the bes accomodations ive stayed in asia. Usually we're not hotel people and we spend time only in the hotel for sleep, but at LKF hotel we enjoyed the facilites there so much that we spent more time in the hotel than originally planned, which meant sacrificing other activies but no complains from us there.Good for value and the service is unbelievably friendly, staff were very helpful and always willing to go out of the way to assist us which we really appreciated and no problems with communication at all.Rooms were reasonably neat and tidy like any standard hotel, and location - absolutely marvelous.Situated close to LKF, very convenient, love the night life there.Usually if returning to the country again, I tend to try out different hotels, but if ever returning to HK, I will defintely return to LKF Hotel and it's a must try for all you travellers who are seeking a bit of luxury, comfort and convenience.

<Content>Lan Kwai Fong Hotel, Hong Kong- decidedly average We knew we were on to a bad deal when we noted the reaction of the first few locals we came into contact with as soon as we mentioned that we were staying in the Lan Kwai Fong Hotel. Extortionate and overpriced were two adjectives used among tuts of dissaproval.We stayed at the Lan Kwai Fong for our honeymoon and expected a little more luxury for the price we paid. The harbour view promised was present, if we craned our necks out of our small balcony risking life and limb but it was nothing like as advertised on the hotel website. I suspect that the pics were taken before 4-5 high rise hotels were built in front of it!The suite was compact and if you don't mind stubbing shins and toes on wedged in furniture as you make your way around, perfectly adequate.The efficiently designed bathroom was adequate and the bath was equipped with a plug, however it was too small to fit the plughole which made a romantic bath somewhat challenging. That's if you could get 2 people in it, being less than half the size of a standard bath. As a shower basin, it just about did the job but the peeling paint used to cover well a worn bath somewhat tainted the feeling of luxury.An offer of 2 nights minimum stay for a reasonable tarriff is advertised on their website but we think this is rarely available and the actual rate is generally somewhat higher.And our tarrif didn't include breakfast, which wasn't made entirely clear at time of booking but apparently this is fairly standard and we shouldn't have expected any. They did however offer to refund the one breakfast we ordered by mistake when we thought it may be included, which was a nice gesture.There were some very lovely oriental style touches and it provided a less bland atmostphere to our stay in comparison with a Best Western or other standard chain hotel but left us feeling like we'd been completely ripped off.

<Content>Belongings disappeared from my room IS THEFT A PROBLEM HERE?The Lan Kwai Fong is a small 'cheapish' hotel that is OK if you want to stay a day or two. BUT I had a shopping bag 'disappear' from the room at the time it was serviced - most probably by accident. The problem was that it had a $300 watch in it that was my polar exercise watch with two years of data on it - should back up I know! - credit card recipts with my signature on it and the receipts for a watch that I had bought that morning but was wearing at the time.When the management could not find any trace of the watch they basically stonewalled me and said that it was my problem because they could not find the watch - well - not very good when our company uses this hotel for it's proximity.My advice - stay away. I did not see the other reports of theft in the other reviews until I read the other reviews on trip advisor following this experience.Try the Salisbury on Kowloon - heaps better. For me next time I am going to stay somewhere that the staff know not to remove ANY shopping bags. I could have spent the extra 300 bucks that I lost in a hotel where the staff know that.The Hotel is OK but they are very very poor at problem fixing!

<Content>great location- but definitelhy unsanitary and bs service The only plus to the place is the central location- howeverI discovered lots of hairs on the layer above the mattress but under the bedsheet. We had to switch 3 different rooms and they all had digusting hair underneath their bedsheet. any ventilation in the restroom, so it has a moldy, towel smell. There was no any ventilation in the restroom, so it has a moldy, towel smell. The rooms are very tiny and the hotel hardly has a lobby.The assistant manager tried to tell me that it is not standard to wash the layer under the bedsheet. How unsanitary! I only stayed because the nights were booked with my plane ticket.I like my mattresses firm, but their mattress was unreasonably hard and uncomfortable. By the end of my stay, I had a wierd bug bite on my leg. The wierd thing is the majority of the staff there are male. They are very unsensitive to the sanitation of the room.In the end they just ended having to vaccum the hairs off the bed!Also the shower was clogged.

<Content>There a better hotels in HK! I am staying frequently in HK for business and usually choose hotels in the price range up to 150US$. This time I was on a vacation with my girlfriend, so I chose a higher priced hotel with a nice harbor view. My room at the hotel was the deluxe room with harbor view, 247 US$ ++ a night, incl. Breakfast.It was the worst hotel I ever stayed in HK! Unfriendly staff, even at the hotel lobby, no hello all the time we come back. Breakfast room for max 20 people and an annoying breakfast buffet! You have to wait in a line to get a seat. Keep in mind, it鈥檚 a 34 floor hotel! Over all, it was just a big rip off! Many better hotels, lower prices as well in HK.

<Content>Beware of bedbugs I had bed bug bite in room 1304. I seriously question the sanitary of this hotel. Don't stay there if you have other options.

<Content>Met all Expectations The Lan Kwai Fong Hotel more than met our expectations of a Hong Kong hotel.Yes, the room wasn't huge (which is to be expected in Hong Kong), and as other reviews have said, the bed was on the firm side. The room was nicely decorated, the bathroom an adequate size with good shower and the harbour views (through the buildings) adequate. We arrived at 9AM with a 2PM check-in time, but were in our room by about 10AM, which was welcome after arriving tired from Europe. We also scored an upgrade to a deluxe room, which was a welcome bonus.The staff were efficient and courteous and the stand-out person was Ms Agnes Cheng, the Sales and Marketing Manager, who provided us with a list of restaurants in the area, ranging from an award winning silver service restaurant to a traditional dim sum tea house. She appeared to have a genuine interest in our stay and also offered sightseeing advice for Hong Kong and Macau.

<Content>Horrible So....The hotel itself is a great idea, in a great part of town. But something went wrong with the execution. I moved out after one night. The beds were rock hard, short and extremely uncomfortable. The rooms were tiny. I didnt believe the other reviews, but i should have. There was no where to turn. The walls were paper thin. we could hear the guy across the hall sneezing. On the flip side, the location was great and the service staff very friendly and helpful. For the price check out other boutiques. I stayed at TheS on another trip and liked it much more.

<Content>Just Sleep on the Floor! The beds are SO hard I woke up in pain every night. The floor is literally softer than the bed! Problem is the rooms are so small that you cannot find the floor after you put your suitcase on it. And there is ONE vacant electric plug in. It's under the desk in the bedroom, so don't think you're going to use hair appliances or anything in the bathroom where you might actually find them useful...Check in was a mess - computer problems. Hence a mixed-up reservation. Staff is all Shanghai Tang'd and pretty self-impressed with their cool hip. But that's pretty much all they should be impressed with.Friends called to leave me messages, which I never get. Oh, lady, phone will be beeping if message waits. There is absolutely nothing in your room to tell you how to actually retrieve a message should you be fortunate enough to get one. (Dial ** if you're wondering.) They checked and said I had received a message all right. But my phone never beeping. Turns out they have been forwarding my messages to a different room... I'd skip this hotel in a hurry....

<Content>If You Must Stay at Lan Kwai Fong Area Lan Kwai Fong Hotel is not a boutique hotel. Yet, it is a good choice for budget hotel if you must stay at Lan Kwai Fong area, Hong Kong's bar and nightlife mecca. LOCATION: while within the bounds of the Lan Kwai Fong and in great proximity to the antique and art shops of Hollywood Road, the hotel is in an unattractive street corner, next to some gloomy looking properties.SERVICE: we had nothing but good experience with the front desk staff. They were quick to check us in, easy to reach, eager to come out to the street and hail a taxi for us, and all over helpful. We didn't use room service.ROOM: while well-equipped, the room was so small as to border on the claustrophobic. We realize that real estate space in scarce in Hong Kong, but with one piece of hand luggage and one large suitcase, we had to hop over our luggage constantly to and fro the bathroom. There's simply no other way to store it. Also, be advised that the bed is oddly stiff in a futon-like manner.DECOR: we enjoyed the pseudo-Chinese decor, but are not convinced that it is of the highest quality. The curtain rod, for one, cracked in half when we attempted to open the curtain. The staff removed the broken rod but did not install a new one by the time of our departure.If you must stay at Lan Kwai Fong and unwilling to splurge (and sufficiently thin), this place might be for you.p.s. Watch out for the confusion between the LKF Hotel and this one. The taxi driver brought us to the former, a much grander establishment in the same area.

<Content>Great location Great location for a short stay in Hong Kong. A short walk from the ferry terminals and IFC mall together with the bars of Soho.Good value for money. Rooms are small, but clean and more than adequate with (if you are lucky) great views.

<Content>Best place to stay in Hong Kong Amazing Tower in the middle of traditional Hong Kong. Rooms small but perfect. Nice furniture, nice people. You get for your money. It's not a budget hotel but it is better than other more expensive. A real boutique hotel.Need only to improve breakfast.

<Content>room fine, service not so hot Just ok. Stayed 3 days on business. Room nicely decorated, interesting urban view, quiet. Good tv, fridge, etc. Small-ish but that's typical in hk. Room service menu pretty limited - just snacks. Service was where they dropped points. Very slow to respond to requests. Then housekeeping managed to remove and misplace one of my items despite my specific request they not do any cleaning - inadvertent but still a hassle. When I asked for a cab to the airport, the bellman just piled all my stuff on the public sidewalk and then disappeared to help somebody else.

<Content>Do not stay at the Lan Kwai Fong Hotel All around bad experience at the Lan Kwai Fong Hotel: extremely small rooms, it says queen bed but it is a hard double bed; clueless reception staff; at what they call their cafe/restaurant bad slow service; extremely slow internet and very very expensive; staff tried to steel from the room at check out, I had to confront the manager for my missing camera case for it to suddenly miraculously reappear; they say they have a shuttle to pick you up and bring you to the airport express but it was out of commission (whatever that means); the only good thing about this hotel is the central location but that's it. My advice: stay somewhere else!

<Content>Loved it! This hotel is great. Close to everything - only a 5 min walk to bars of lan kwai fong (but far enough away to not have any noise), and also only 5 mins to central. The rooms are a bit on the small side but it is Hong Kong! The rooms are beautifully decorated in a chinese/japanese theme and the staff are very helpful.Only thing I did notice was that there was nothing stopping you opening the windows to great extents, so people with children may want to be wary as rooms can be on very high floors (I think we were on 18 and they went up to about 30).Otherwise a superb hotel.

<Content>hidden treasure! this charming little boutique hotel is in a great location (just a short walk from downtown central). I stayed with my boyfriend who was visiting for the weekend and we were very impressed with the room and the service for the price. The contemporary asian decor is fabolous, I had previously stayed in the Mandarin Oriental and actually found it quite similar! Very quiet and cozy. The design and overall ambience make up for the smaller size of the rooms. A perfect choice for your first visit to hong kong because of it's tasteful style and great location!
