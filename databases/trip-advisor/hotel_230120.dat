<Content>Brilliant hotel, all you could ask for The hotel is located in a very convenient place, 5 mins walk from the central station and 2 mins from Dam Sq.The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are generous sizes and the beds are really comfortable. You get free evain water, lovely toiletries and slippers and dressing gowns, everything to make your stay even more satisfying. The only downer for me was it was really noisy outside the hotel room, at 6 in the morning the delivery trucks would start arriving, became very tedious.Apart from that its great, it has a nice restaurant, a gym, library, masseuse.Would definately stay here again.

<Content>Accor needs to rename it "MERCURE" This SOFITEL is very central. Less than 10 minutes walking from the Central Train Station and 5 minutes from Dam Square and all the other attractions in Amsterdam.Staff is very nice, friendly and helpful.The rooms are clean, but are not luxury appointed like SOFITEL spoiled me before in other hotels.You get everything you need in the room, included tea/coffee maker but the enviroment and decor is absolutely NOT a SOFITEL ambiance and the all property looks a little old fashion.I think that ACCOR HOTELS should downgrade this hotel and place it in the Mercure properties because it can't compete with a Luxury Hotel the way it should and in the way SOFITEL is known to be.

<Content>Good Stay in a Sea of Chaos Stayed here for New Years 2008. The location is right in Dam Square and this is pretty much a standard business hotel. I usually prefer staying in a small local hotel with a little more personality but we booked late and this was really all we could find. Everyone was really nice and the room was quiet and comfortable. If you are looking for a good generic hotel right in the center of the city this is the place. If you want the local experience though, you might want to look else where.

<Content>Rundown and Disappointing! The Sofitel was chosen for the group I travelled with for the Amsterdam Marathon. I would not have personally chosen this hotel, that said we did spend three nights in a very dark (even with every light turned on) and very small guest room which looked onto the very small alley way on the side of the Hotel. The decor throughout the property is well past its prime and needs replacement. The carpet in the guest rooms is well beyond that level and can no longer be made to appear clean. The marshmallow bed referred to in another posting here...is a veiled way of making a lumpy old mattress seem to have some new life. The feather bed and comforter were nice, but the bed itself was not! The bathroom included cracked tiles along the wall near the floor and just seemed worn (not dirty...just worn). The guest room was directly across from the elevators, which caused me some concern, but did not prove to be a significant problem. The staff at the front desk were young and very helpful with the exception of Rene, who appeared to be a manager/supervisor for the Hotel. When inquiring about internet access both by phone and at the desk he appeared to be miffed that at other locations in the world it is not uncommon for it to be easily accessed or complimentary. Rene clarified that This is not America. to us as we inquired about hotspots in the neighborhood, and that there is a charge for everything in The Netherlands. His tone and demeanor put us off from any further interactions with the staff at the Hotel, making us feel very unwelcome and unappreciated as guests in his Hotel.

<Content>Really good stay at the Sofitel We chose the Sofitel Amsterdam after reading various reviews and finding that it was conveniently located to the train station. Unfortunately, British Airways lost our luggage on our way from Heathrow, so our mood upon arrival was less than pleasant. Luckily though, we didn't have our luggage while we walked from the station to the Sofitel. We didn't have the best directions to find it and wound up taking the wrong turn at a junction so after about 25 minutes of walking in the wrong direction, we came across the Sofitel. Upon arrival, we came across two very friendly and very helpful staff who helped us check in with ease. When we informed them that we didn't have any luggage, they took all of the details and continued to contact the agent regarding the whereabouts of our belongings (apparently this happens to at least 15 of their guests per week with BA, so if you have a connecting flight on your way to Amsterdam, don't be surprised if your bags don't make it).The room was a very good size, with a comfortable bed and clean bathroom. We spent more time in the room than we'd expected, waiting for our bags to arrive, and it was very comfortable. We ate in the restaurant/bar which was very nice and also had room service (without a change of clothes we were reluctant to go out too much) which was lovely - they had a fantastic pasta which is highly recommended. The location was great, quite close to the shopping area (and not too far from the red light district). Amsterdam was a lovely city and we were really surprised at how much we liked it. The Sofitel was a perfect choice and was great value for money.Would definitely recommend a stay at the Sofitel Amsterdam.

<Content>Expensive, Run down, Dirty This hotel does not match the pictures shown on the hotel website. The rooms are not clean and need to be renovated. The bathrooms are filthy, so if you stay here, bring disinfectant with you. The furnishings are old and run down. This is basically a scam with the hotel representing that they are a luxury hotel when nothing could be further from the truth.

<Content>Deluxe accomodations in the heart of Amsterdam Besides the good price and great location my wife and I stayed here for the famed marshmallow bed. We were not disappointed...We stayed for two nights as the relaxing end to our tour through London and Paris. We came in on the train from Paris and the hotel is a short walk from Central Station. It is also a street or two over (and they're tiny streets) from the Damrak and tons of shopping, dining, and just about everything else in Amsterdam.When we checked in, workers were redoing the road outside. The front desk advised that our room would be in the front overlooking the street. I asked if they had anything else due to the construction, but they assured me that we would not be able to hear it through the double windows and that the room was very nice. They were quite polite and exactly right! (they even sent up a fruit basket later just to make sure we were comfortable)The room was practically a suite with high ceilings and large windows overlooking the street outside. The bed was king and was the promised comfort of marshmallow goodness. The shower had a tropical rain spout directly overhead that was like showering in a hot waterfall. The bathroom kit included very nice French soaps, lotions, and shampoos.Maybe we enjoyed it extra much after our smaller rooms in London and Paris, but we loved the Sofitel and would definitely stay there again--make it a tradition even because of that magical bed! :)

<Content>Soft spot for Sofitel My wife and I stayed here for a couple of nights after a river cruise up from Budapest. We were very impressed.I had booked via the Sofitel website and found a Book 3 nights and get a night free type package which included a picnic basket on one of the days. Well, the picnic basket lasted us for 3 meals! It was huge. We had to clear out the mini-bar to store the leftovers. And the food was lovely.We had to leave the ship in the morning but the Sofitel was able to accommodate us with an early check in. The room was excellent and the location the same. I could not fault the staff in any way. All were very helpful.I recommend this hotel very highly.

<Content>Great Location...Great Bed! First off I Pricelined this hotel and was very happy with the price and location so my expectations were not as high as if I paid full price.I love Amsterdam and this was not my first trip. The location was perfect. A train outside and walking distance to most everything. The side of the Dam it is on is serene. It is like you are in the middle of it all but in a lovely quiet spot. The room we had was big with a view of the street that had great morning people watching. The front desk was pleasant. The restaurant/bar was overpriced and small but with restaurants and bars everywhere you look I wouldn't bother with the hotel bar.The bed was amazing! The room was clean. The bathroom was big. If I saw this for a good deal I would book it again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Good location, great bed, horrible view We spent four nights staying at the Sofitel in Amsterdam at the tail end of a two week trip in Europe - overall, we felt pretty neutral about this hotel, there was some pros/cons, but overall this was our least favorite hotel of our trip....In terms of the room itself, it was pretty big and clean. The hotel is very traditional in terms of decor so anyone looking for something modern, look elsewhere. Bed was heavenly as others have mentioned -- nice, big, and fluffy. Bathroom was decent sized as well and nicely stocked. There was a mini-bar with a fridge (but would have preferred to have our own fridge to use to stock beverages and snacks.)One of the worst parts of the hotel was our view or lack thereof. We basically stared at a nasty alleyway whenever our window was open - I don't know if there are better views in this hotel and how to get them, but if you can figure out a way to do it, ask. It would have been nice to have a more comfortable homebase in terms of staying in the room - basically we only were there to sleep and take a shower because the view was so dismal.As far as location, it's situated nicely in the city centre with good tram access. It's also in walking distance to the train station. We walked pretty much everywhere from our hotel including the red light district, west and south canal belts, and the old south section with the van gogh and rijksmuseum (tram might be better for getting to the old south though, we were optimistic on our walk!) Breakfast was not included and expensive (22 euros/person). This hotel definitely had a vibe for older folks, so if you are younger, might want to look elsewhere (we are late twenties/early 30s and felt like the youngest people there.)

<Content>Disappointing Experience We stayed at the Sofitel in Amsterdam in July 2008, and were very disappointed that it wasn't up to the usual Sofitel standard.The staff were not particularly friendly, and the rooms were very tired, dark and gloomy. Considering the rate, we would have expected a much higher standard.This hotel was chosen for it's location which was very convenient to get around Amsterdam, but I couldn't recommend it for any other reason.The beds however were gloriously comfortable which was a feature that many other fellow travellers had experienced.

<Content>Impolite stuff Me and my husband have checked out around 10 a.m. and requested our bags to be picked up and kept in concierge till 2 pm so we can pick them up on the way to the airport. Around 12:30 I wanted to transfer our shopping bags to our luggages and then unfortunately everything has started to turn bitter.Ms. Eva at the reception asked for a receipt. I told her that she didin't give me one. She said that she gave it to my husband. I said ok, I am not getting my bags I just want to put the last minutes shopping bags. She took me to the luggage room but our bags werent there. I said maybe they are still in the room. The answer was How am I suppose to know that I need to bring your suitcases here if you don't tell me? I said We told you that. She was insisting that we didn't told here. Anyway she started to be realy rude and I was very uncomfortable to hear impolite and unpleasant words from her. Than she told me 鈥樷€檇o you know how many people I am serving everyday how do you expect from me to remember all of them 鈥欌€?at this point I was even surprised more to see the customer relation skills of the staff. I am telling you it turned literally ugly finally she told me to shut my mouth. At that point I was so upset that I started to cry than Mr. Jonathan P. KOK came and has been witnessed some part of this incident and tried to calm me.I went there for a holiday and this person ruined my day. I do not see any point that they may talk to me in that manner no need to mention the insulting part. I don't have an intention to go to any other Sofitel Hotel on my other trips.

<Content>Friendly place My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel for 2 nights in December 2007. Prior to booking I joined the free Sofitel Privilege scheme which meant that we were entitled to a complementary late check out (4pm) and a free drink in the hotel bar. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was small but had a high vaulted ceiling which made it feel more spacious. Although there was no view, we liked the room as it felt cozy and the beds were extremely comfortable. Another plus point was that the air conditioning unit was quiet and there was no noise from the corridor even though the hotel was busy. The decor throughout the hotel was quite dated and not what I was expecting from a Sofitel. We didn't have breakfast as we felt it was over-priced.The location is very good - just a short walk from both the station and Dam Square.We've been to Amsterdam several times before and would definitely stay at the Sofitel again as it feels more like a family run hotel than part of a big chain.

<Content>Just OK I expected more from this hotel. I did not think the beds were all that special. The staff was stiff and some were in training and did not know what they were doing. Breakfast was 22 Euros, which I thought was a lot. In this hotel expect to pay for every service. I wish we would have stayed at the first hotel we were at until our trip on the Riverboat. Probably would not stay there again, but it was not bad.

<Content>The most friendly  Without doubt the most friendly  professional staff we have found worldwide - nothing was too much trouble  the advice they gave was excellent and always with a smile. The room was spotless, the bed enormous  most comfortable but it did make the room seem small by comparison ! Presumably the price reflects the cost of hotels in Amsterdam but even with our booking well in advance  getting nearly 40% off the rack rate it was still expensive for a room only rate. We didn't avail ourselves of the hotel's breakfast at the extortionate rate of 22 Euros p.p. as there were many eateries offering breakfast at much more realistic prices within a minute of the hotel ( and we could sit outside  enjoy the sunshine ! ).It's typical of a 4star chain hotel - there are no nasty surprises  it's hard to beat for location.One tip ( from the hotel staff ) - if travelling to the airport catch the tram to Central Station , one stop from just outside the hotel  catch the airport train that runs every 15 mins. The fare is 3.60 p.p. as opposed to 45Euros for a taxi  the train stops in the main airport concourse.

<Content>A little disappointing after Brussels This is a decent hotel, but we were spoiled completely after our experience at the Sofitel Brussels Europe.This is walking distance from the Centraal station, just follow your nose straight down the bridge, and the hotel is on your left. There was a bottle on the table, and after our experience with a few 3-star hotels, and of course at the Brussels one, we drank it. It was part of the mini-bar and we were charged for it. The staff are friendly enough, but were nowhere as efficient or as polished as those in Brussels. The water is one of the cleanest in Europe, so you can drink from the tap safely. Our request for a high floor room and non-smoking were both not met, and we were in a small room with a tiny bathroom, not quite what we expected at a Sofitel. The exterior of the hotel and the lobby were a big disappointment - perhaps the Sofitel Grand is the one that the usual business traveller stays at.

<Content>Cozy haven in Amsterdam Just a week before our trip to the Netherlands, we discovered that we had one more night in our vacation than we had thought and suddenly needed to find a room in Amsterdam for the weekend just before the Queen's Birthday holiday (April 30). It was very difficult to find one but I did so at the Sofitel. It was much more expensive than I would have otherwise chosen but the Sofitel turned out to be a very pleasant hotel. Our room was small but clean and nicely decorated. It looked out onto a tiny alley and so had no view but was very quiet. The only negative comment I have (besides the high price) is that the bathroom fixtures looked old to me. They should be modernized. You can see in one of the photos posted that the sink is cracked and stained. The breakfast was expensive (鈧?22) but was delicious with lots of wonderful options. Before eating breakfast, we went out onto the street to try to find a less expensive restaurant but didn't find anything since it isn't a very touristy location. However, for dinner we did find a delicious Moraccan restaurant (Marrikech) just down the street at Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal 134 that I can recommend. The hotel is in a very convenient location, in walking distance to the train station and right on a tram line leading to the museums. But, though convenient, it isn't in a particularly nice location.Given a choice, I probably wouldn't stay here again because of the expense.

<Content>Great Hotel! I recently returned from my first trip to Europe and I stayed 3 nights at the Sofitel Amsterdam to begin my trip. Room: was very clean, modern and well-appointed. Bed was unbelievable comfortable. Yes, my single room was small by American Standards but more than good for a single traveler. My only complaint is the shower got warm, but not hot. Stayed on the 3rd floor and had no problems with street noise. Staff: front desk staff were very friendly, attentive and spoke English very well. Housekeeping came early AM, but respected the Do Not Disturb sign. Location: Sofitel is walking distance from Centraal Station, Dam Square, the Red Light District, and many shops and restaurants. It is a short Tram, Bus, or Canal Boat ride to the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, Anne Frank House, and much more. I had an excellent meal at the Cafe Habsburg just a few blocks west. Breakfast: was sooo good! Great selection: eggs, meat, cereal, pastry, fruit, waffles, pancakes, all very fresh and the service was excellent. Disclaimer: breakkfast was included in my room rate. Overall I highly recommend this hotel without hesitation and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Terrible hotel!!! I have just left the Sofitel Amsterdam and, although being an experienced traveler, I can assure that it was one of my worst hotel experiences ever.I booked my stay for 4 nights through RAI, a Dutch travel agency that was organizing the congress I was attending.The Sofitel simply didn't honor the rate that was in my voucher, charging me more. When I showed them my voucher, they simply said that I would have to complain with the travel agency that gave me the wrong rate. Absurd!!The room was extremely small, noisy and dirty. Besides that, a horrible decor (just tak a look at the candid photos) and crampy service. All that for 200 euros + tax a night w/o breakfast.What else can I say? They charge only 22 euros per day for internet connection.Take my advice: if you are going to Amsterdam, skip the Sofitel.

<Content>A very nice Amsterdam Hotel We stayed in the Sofitel for 5 nights (3/23 - 3/28). I thought it was a very nice experience. The rooms were average size by european standards and very clean, nice clean compact bathrooms, the beds were very comfortable and the staff was friendly. Amenities included robe  slippers, instant coffee  tea along with a minibar that you could also store some items in to keep them cool. Of course it is smoky in the lobby but that is most places in Europe and especially Amsterdam. The room however did not smell of smoke. A solid 3 1/2 star hotel.The location is great, easy to get to everything yet not on a street crowded with tourists. Our only complaint was that the AC hadn't been turned on and even with turning off the heat, our room was rather warm but opening the window made for a loud night for sleeping. We paid 140 Euros/night which I felt was a resonable price. It is not on a particularly picturesque street but the canals and Jordaan is less than a 5 minute walk as is Dam square. We will stay here again next year.The breakfast was expensive for our taste at 22 Euro/person. There is a great Seattle style coffee shop at the end of the block (turn right out of the hotel) for coffee and pasteries, the owner Frank is a great guy. Also, along with another reviewer, I would highly recommend Humphrey's Restaurant (also one block to the right out of the hotel at Nieuwezijds Kolk). 21.50 Euro prix fixe for a great 3 course dinner (the best we had in Amsterdam).

<Content>Miexd views Mixed views on this place. Postives-friendly helpful staff- clean comfortable rooms with good facilities- well locatedNegatives- communal areas stink of smoke. This is an Amsterdam problem not just this hotel- whilst decor is tidy and in good condition it needs updating- previous reviews note very soft beds, pillows, etc. These were too soft making sleeping sweaty and uncomfortable.In general it was OK but will not be going back to Amsterdam because of the constant assault on my nose and lungs by cigarette smoke. I have never seen so many people smoking. Too long here will damage your health even if you don't smoke

<Content>A tale of 2 rooms... Stayed here on a Saturday and Sunday night - 2 adults and 1 child. Checking in and out was hassle free, with friendly reception staff. Our daughter was given a small backpack with some drawing stuff, which was a nice touch to start the weekend at the hotel.The foyer and public areas were clean and well presented. The lifts to the rooms could only be accessed using your room keycard. We were allocated room 118, which was a triple room with a king size and a single bed - both very comfortable. The bathroom was clean and functional with a good selection of toiletries and towels. Robes and slippers were available. The decor was OK. There was no in-room safe, so we had to use the safe deposit boxes held at reception - no hassle whatsoever.Room 118 looks out on to a small alleyway - directly opposite a bar and hostel - perhaps 15ft away if that. The bad news for us was that this bar stayed open all night and we could hear the thumping bass from the sound system. People were constantly coming and going - one on a motorbike, which was revving-up directly under our window at 2.00am. The music was still booming at 8.00am! We werent awake all night, but did not get a restful sleep.From reading previous reviews, we were aware that there were some noise issues, which prompted me to email the hotel and request a quiet room. In the morning, my wife went down to reception and explained the situation. The front desk staff were very apologetic and said they would arrange for us to be moved.We went out for the day and when we came back, we picked up the keys to room 123, which turned out to be what I presume was a junior suite, with a large sitting area containing 2 armchairs and a sofa, which converted to a bed. A kingsize bed was around the corner. The bathroom had 2 doors - one to the lounge area and one to the bed area. There was no difference to the amenities, with the exception of an in-room safe being available. We were presented with a gift tray of chocolate and a tin of Dutch biscuits, which again was a nice touch.It was a corner room and was surrounded on all sides by private residential properties. We had a very restful second night.We did not take the hotel's breakfast or use the bar, so cannot comment on that. However, we were impressed with the staff and the customer service and would use this hotel again, given a room in the right location.

<Content>That was a great stay The hotel is situated right in the centre of the city, e.g. some steps from Damrak - the main street of Amsterdam. The Old King's Palace at Dam Square, as well as Amsterdam Centraal railway station and Mme Tussaud Museum are of a few minutes short walk from the hotel.We made the reservation through Sofitel Reservation Services getting a 鈧?149 offer per night for 2 adults and 2 children. A 鈧?7.03 city tax (per night) was added to our bill upon checkout.When checking-in I was impressed by seeing a great Queen's portrait behind the receptionist;the next day I was even luckier to see Her Majesty the Queen right one meter from myself!The room was great, though we noticed poor general lighting.The beds were excellent and I could hardly imagine whether there might have been a bed better than the one I slept in in Sofitel Amsterdam.The bathroom and shower were allright, too.We were absolutely happy that we had chosen this hotel for our short stay in the Netherlands and I can proudly recommend the hotel to my best friend.

<Content>A rocket of a trip I recently spent New Years Eve at the Sofitel Amsterdam. It was a short trip, so will be a short review, however, in general and especially given the location and price, I would recommend.Good points:The beds were amazing 鈥?and great linenCentral location and within easy reach of all tourist attractions 鈥?a great base for exploring the city on footVery short walk from the central train station 鈥?the journey from the airport to the central station is a very cheap (c.鈧? I think)The free pasty-like treats in reception CheapBad pointsThe beds were amazing 鈥?and very difficult to get out ofThe hotel charged me 鈧?0 to use the internetThe bar shut at 2am, which for Amsterdam is disappointing Not on a great road 鈥?bit of a walk to find a nice caf茅 or lunch venueNew Years Eve was great fun 鈥?a few drinks followed by a lovely meal at a restaurant called Nomads. And then came the walk home to the hotel which felt like we were in an episode of Band of Brothers 鈥?rockets and fireworks being let off in all directions - from all places imaginable 鈥?people鈥檚 hands, off car bonnets, in the road, from drain-pipes etc. A scary but exhilarating experience.My number 1 tip, and we learnt from experience, is if you would like to go to a top restaurant, book it up in advance. Try the Supper Club鈥?.

<Content>Central Located for Amsterdam Sights Stayed here for 2 nights visiting a friend in Amsterdam, overall a good standard 4 star hotel with feather beds and a cosy (smallish) room with plenty of facilities. As it is situated on a busy road - trams, bikes and cars - I would advise asking for a quiet room at the back of the hotel - 501 was great romantic room and of course if you require a non- smoking you must request. Non-smoking is only in the breakfast room and some guest rooms (22 Euros each for breakfast was expensive we thought, so popped round the corner to a great non-smoking coffee opposite the church and directly opposite the tulip hotel.Room - clean, tv, writing desk, minibar, robe, slippers, large bathroom with good shower and toiletries, kettle with tea/coffee etc plus free bottle of water on arrival,24 hr room service. Iron and board on request and anything else you may have needed!5-10 mins walk from train station, we only had one case so was fairly easy, they did offer us to store luggage once you check out and want to sight see. Staff - friendly and very helpful. 5 mins to Dam Square and Amsterdam overall was easy to walk around, most shops don't open until 11-12 so it seems quiet in the back streets!In De Waag - Neuwemarket - Fab restaurant - ate there 2 nights - fairly pricey but very worth it, red meat, vegetarian and yummy deserts. Great atmosphere, if you want a romantic meal best asking for one of their quiet corners at the end of the restaurant it also caters for large parties and is worth booking in advance.Trams, cars and bikes makes crossing the roads a bit of a challenge so keep you eyes peeled, few near misses!!!! Cold and wet in January so unless you have to I'd wait for the spring, bit like most european places!!! Enjoy

<Content>Wonderful hotel We just spent three nights with our two small children at this very nice hotel. It was wonderfully located to the historic sections of Amsterdam. The staff were extremely nice and were very helpful. The rooms were a tad small, but nicely appointed. The street and alleyway noise was noticeable, but I doubt you can get around that if you are staying in central Amsterdam. There are two tram stops out front, so access to the station and rest of the city is very easy. It was a somewhat less crazy part of town then elsewhere, particularly in the evening, so there were not too many obnoxious revelers in the area. There is a large supermarket just down the road and many restaurants in the vicinity. Internet access is fairly expensive (you must buy an hour or day access).

<Content>Feather beds We have just returned from a New Year break at this hotel. The hotel and its location and service were fine. I had booked twin rooms and since only 1 of the 3 twins booked was available they upgraded 1 room and put a portable bed in the third bedroom, as my son and his male friend refused to share a double bed. The portable bed was extremely uncomfortable although my son didn't report this to the hotel so didn't give the hotel a chance to improve the situation .The normal beds were extremely comfortable and really this is the reason I am writing a review. Be aware that the pillows, mattress and mattress topping are feathered. if you have an allergy to these, as I do, you can request the bedding to be changed but do so in advance. Do not spend an unpleasant first night as I did because reception were unaware that alternative bedding was available.

<Content>Great Location... Wonderful Staff We have recently stayed at Sofitels in Asia and N. America so I'm confident with this chain. They do have the most comfy hotel beds, after its convenient location, that was my #2 factor for choosing this hotel. We traveled by train from AMS airport and we departed also via the train station to Belgium. This hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the train station; less without the luggage! It's in a safe/clean neighborhood, tram line is right in front of the hotel, and less than 5 mins walk to the DAM. There is a large supermarket in close proximity also. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, 22 euros per person sounds like a lot for breakfast food. Hotels has a basket of apples, tangerines at the counter which is a nice little treat on your way in/out of the hotel. If you don't have your lab top, you can get an internet card and use their business center. 10 euros for 45 mins and about 13 euros for 90 mins; we got the 90 mins and we were able to use this same internet access card at the Marriott in Brussels (i-Bahn). We got our rooms on the 1st floor adjacent to an alley; you can hear people talk when they walk by! I suggest asking for a room on a higher floor. Rooms are much smaller than expected but maybe considered large Amsterdam stardard. Extra information/tips not directly relevant to the hotel.....We were there during Dec. 25-28 (all the small businesses were closed).... didn't noticed until the very last day that there is an internet place a few doors over (north of the hotel, same side). We had a dinner meal at this Holland restaurant just a few doors south of the hotel, same side.... we didn't like it. Service was good but I suggest look elsewhere for food near the hotel. We had dinner at this seafood restaurant called Lucius (about 15 mins walk)... it was superb (if you like seafood)! You can easily find info on this restaurant online.

<Content>Excellent value for money I will try to be brief: I am a hotel owner, very peculiar in taste with hotels, normally stay in boutique hotels, difficult with sleep and difficult to be pleased in general. We booked this hotel via an agency as i was travelling with a friend who was on a budget and i didnt want to bother looking around and i was initially sceptical about he choice (could i have chosen i would propably opt for something like Dylan or Arena hotel). I dont know the exact rate but i think it should be around 120-140 euros for a twin with breakfast. For this price level (we were there in xmass which is apparently a,low season to them) this was a very good choice. Convenient location, near but not on the sleezy red lights and very near the 3 beautiful canals (dont remember the names). We got a 5th floor room and it was biggy and confortable with pleasant street views, nice bed, clean and mora than aynything quiet (no noice from neighboring rooms). We were treated in a prof way albeit impersonal (which was still ok). Few negatives which didnt spoil my good feeling: Boring breakfast in an unatractive room (why couldnt they have a more interesting and richer range of cheeses?), dated and more like a 3* bathroom (but not small).Overall if you can get a good rate and a top floor room and if you dont mind this kind of impersonal feeling this is a good pick.To end, Amsterdam is a very pretty city, perfect for a city break (boring for more than 3 nights), with expeptionally polite people and a very bohemian-youngish charm!!

<Content>Even Better 2nd Time Around This was our second visit to this hotel, and again everything was excellent. The room was a good size for a European hotel, it was a standard room however I did notice that some of the other rooms on the backside of the hotel looked significantly smaller, so if room size is important to you I would suggest asking for one at the front of the hotel. The staff were all very courteous and friendly. Housekeeping was excellent although last time we stayed the tea and coffee was replenished in large quantities but not this time. It was however possible to request a very large pot of tea or coffee from room service for five Euros which compared to the prices of bars, cafes and restaurants in the area is excellent. Again the best bit was the bed!!!! I arranged the hotel for 5 couples and was very pleased that they also were all very happy with the accommodation and service here, thoroughly recommended!!

<Content>PRIVATE AND COMFORTABLE WOW-They gave us a wonderful executive suite and it was very quiet. It was a 10 minute walk from the train station. This particular hotel does not offer lotion, so bring your own and they also run out of face towels. Housekeeping is not that great, we had to go behind them to clean things off. It's an older building and the ceilings in the room are low, so I wouldn't suggest anyone over 6 feet to stay in the executive suite and it also does not offer a bathtub but a huge shower. But this hotel is centrally located to everything and I would stay there again. I would also not suggest using there internet from the room, it may not connect , but they do have a business office on the first floor. Jose the Concerige was very nice and accomodating and made our stay very nice.

<Content>Nearly excellent hotel in Amsterdam I had a lovely three day stay at this hotel in Amsterdam which was within a 5-7 minute walk from Centraal Station and right in the heart of central Amsterdam, without being in an overly crowded area. The room was excellent to outstanding, the staff were most helpful and amenities were top quality. I found the internet access (at 20 Euros per day) to be exorbitant, as were many other hotel offers (breakfast was also particularly expensive), and although the room was of european size, it was completely comfortable and modern. The rest of the hotel (hallways, foyer, etc.) could do with an update, but it was definitely clean and welcoming. I'd highly recommend this location.

<Content>Great location, Perfect Beds I stayed for six nights in a junior suite at the Sofitel Amsterdam at the end of Aug/beginning of Sept. Here is my synopsis:Pros: The bed. I would venture to say it was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in while traveling - and I travel at least one to three months per year. Best nights of sleep I have had in a very long time. I never heard one outside noise the entire week. Even if there were no more positives, the bed was worth the entire stay.The location. It amuses me that someone would book a hotel within a 5-minute walk of the Red Light district, in a city where smoking marijuana in public is accepted, and then fault the hotel for reminding them of the seedier side of Amsterdam. We walked the city every day for a week and never even happened upon the Red Light District - literally forgot to visit it! And the smoking coffee shops are everywhere in the city - not just on the same street as the hotel.That being said, I found the location perfect for the first-time traveler to Amsterdam simply because it's in very close proximity to many of the places a new tourist visits. It's about 3 blocks from Central Station (walk or pay 15E for a taxi!), it's around the corner from Dam Square, and there is a tram stop directly in front of the hotel - it truly doesn't get anymore convenient than that!The staff. Although I wasn't sure at first, the staff (for the most part) turned out to be helpful and courteous. We were treated with respect and kindness no matter what we asked for or needed to know. As with most European hotel experiences I've had, they don't actively jump in and offer to help, but they are there when you need them. One thing I greatly appreciate about Amsterdam is that most people in the service industry speak perfect English.Cons:The lighting. I agree with the other reviewers that the lighting absolutely needs to be improved in both the bedroom/living areas AND the bathroom. My friend's room next door was even worse - and that was before two of her lightbulbs burned out.The fitness room. Although it is a treat to be offered a fitness room in a European hotel, this one isn't worth calling a treat. A recumbant bike whose seat would not stay in position, a rowing machine, and a thing to do crunches/sit-ups. No free weights and no paper cups for the water fountain. It needed an eliptical or treadmill or both!The Internet. T-mobile - need I say more? I spent a small fortune to have access for a week here, then went to Prague and got 24/7 wireless for free.Other than that, I found no fault with Sofitel Amsterdam, and although I probably would not stay there again (because I always like to try other parts of a city when I come back), I would definitely recommend it to any first-time visitors. I thought it was a good value, great location, and the pros definitely outweighed the cons.I'd like to add that if you are a chocolate lover, you absolutely MUST walk to Puccini at Singel 184. Simply the best, IMHO. It's no more than 10 minutes to walk from the Sofitel.

<Content>Loved the Sofitel I have just returned from staying at the Sofitel in Amsterdam and I had a great experience there. The hotel is really near to all the main tourist attractions (such as Dam Square) but it is in a quieter street so you feel safer. It is also within easy walking distance of the train station. The staff were very friendly and gave us lots of information about things to do and places to go. The bed was so comfy, I wish I had the same one at home! The room was immaculate and I couldn't really fault much about the hotel except we didn't really have a view but that didn't bother me, after all, you don't visit a city to stay in your room all the time!

<Content>Very disappointed in this Sofitel My wife and I usually love staying at Sofitels, however this one is worth skipping! Even though it has a prime location and is easy walking distance to many key attractions (including the red light district if you are interested in that sort of thing). The hotel itself leaves something to be desired. First of all, the parking situation: If you are driving, do not stay in this area AT ALL! It is very tricky to get around and they are doing a lot of road construction in the area. Once you do get to the parking area it is a ways down the street and it was not very enjoyable dragging our suit cases from the car. What I was most upset about was cost of the parking. We are not strangers to parking in European city centers, however, when we found the cost of parking was 40 euros we were a bit upset, especially since the website does not bother to mention the cost.Next, the rooms: The rooms were quite nice except for the noise and the lighting. We had every available light turned on and the room was still very dark, and that was during the day. We could also hear a lot of noise from our neighbors and from above us. We skipped breakfast for 2 reasons. First, we were tired of eating big breakfasts (this was our last night of a month long trip in Europe). Secondly, the price 22 Euros/person. A steep ransom for eggs, cheese and cold cuts.Another turnoff for us was the surroundings. As soon as you step outside the hotel you are in the thick of what makes Amsterdam not-so-charming, the sex and drugs! We are not prudes, but we both feel that Amsterdam could be one of the Europe's most charming, attractive cities if they got rid of the red light area and the drugs. But because of these, there seems to be a layer of scum on the city that can't be scraped off and is always a distraction no matter where you go in Amsterdam.

<Content>Like sleeping on a cloud! This is a nice business hotel but the beds make it something really special. Staff are friendly and the facilities are good. It's very close to Central Station but slightly outside the really touristy area, so it feels quiet and safe. The main attraction is the incredible beds in each room. They are incredibly soft and comfortable and gave me the best night of sleep I have ever had.

<Content>Don't bother. We have just returned for a trip to Germany and Amsterdam, having enjoyed our stay at Mercure in Koblenz, we booked the Sofitel in Amsterdam, which is owned by the same group. The location is very good, however, the hotel certainly does not represent good value for money. It is dark and a bit depessing.Housekeeping was practically non existent, perhaps becasue we stayed over a weekend, but for Euro 450.00 for two nights we expected the the beds would be made etc. New towels were delivered and that was that. Lack of cleaning was evident in the public areas also, the caprets were dirty, whatever was on them when we arrived was still there when we left! Unlke the Mercure, where I could use the computer in the foyer free of charge each day to check my emails, sofitel charged 5.00 euro for 15 minutes.I'm sure there are better choices to be had in central Amsterdam.

<Content>Best Night's Sleep of my life The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on- and these words are coming from a flight attendant who has sampled more hotel beds than I care to remember. The room was cozy and quiet, the staff helpful and professional and the service in the bar was friendly. The interior was tasteful for its time, but a warmer, lighter, modern makeover would feel more comfortable. Ideally located near the central station and tram. We didn't use the dining facilities but across the street is a cafe with outdoor seating serving up tasty hot breakfast and coffee for under 10 euros.

<Content>Well located, reasonable 4 star hotel We'd stayed in an excellent Sofitel in midtown New York a couple of years ago, and found this in Amsterdam for a decent price, so decided to give it a go. Positives/negatives:+ Walking distance from Central train station+ Close to many key areas including Dam Square+ Our room was clean, quiet and comfortable+ Attractive public area downstairs+ Quirky bar - replica of an Orient Express-type train carriage+ Friendly reception and housekeeping staff- Decor on our floor and in room a bit tired- Located on major road from stationOn the whole, it felt like a good value, low-end 4 star hotel, doing everything pretty well, but not feeling that special.

<Content>Superb accomadation/superb location. Stayed at the Sofitel for 2 nights on 27/28 July. We went with friends so all in all there were 3 couples. We booked the hotel via hotel search on google and got an excellent hot deal. It did not include breakfast but that was not an issue for us as it ment we could be more flexible.We all had rooms next to each other and have to say i could not fault them at all. Rooms were excellent and had ensuite with good shower and bath BEDS...... They were absolutely fabulous. By far the best bed i have ever slept in and that includes my own. So comfortable that it was quite a wrench to get out!!!!!If you want your tea and coffee replenishing then you will have to ask otherwise they dont automatically replenish them but other than that i would absolutely stay there again and most certainly recommend it to anybody. it is ideally situated to the train station and for all the action. Tram stops directly outside across the road and 10 min walk max to train station.PERFECT.

<Content>a wonderful hotel Stayed at the Sofitel Amsterdam for 8 days.From the time we got there until the time we left,they made you feel like royalty.Any request you had was never too much effort. They were always willing to help you out.Our air conditioner didnt seem cool enough,so we called the front desk.In a matter of minutes,they were up there and came back later to make sure it was working properly.The beds are one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in.The maids kept the rooms very clean.The hotel is centrally located and they will help you out with restaurants and anywhere you want to go..They have a minibar in the room,but didn't use it. There is a supermarket just up the street,so we brought soda and snacks there and put it in the refrigerator to keep it cold.If we go back to Amsterdam,we will definitely stay at this hotel.

<Content>Mediocre Mediocre best describes everything about this hotel. Staff was ok, the rooms were dark, stuffy  somewhat unpleasant (excluding the comfy beds)  the location was convenient enough. There are so many hotels, all with an equally convenient location  priced comparably, that I wouldn鈥檛 recommend this hotel.

<Content>Wonderful location, excellent service I stayed in Sofitel Hotel Amsterdam for two nights during a weekend in June 07. After a lot of searching I found by my travel agent this hotel: great location (a few minutes walking from Dam Square and from Central Station), good price (160 Euros per night with complementary breakfast) and great service. Staff has always been very kind and has always been at disposal for suggestions on visiting Amsterdam and room service was fast, very polite and efficient.I really enjoyed breakfast served in main restaurant (I do suggest you to book it in advance, so you can save up to 10 euros per person per night).Rooms are not very big but they are definitely comfortable (try the legendary Sofitel beds) and furnished with everything you would expect: minibar, soft bathrobes, tons of extra pillows and very fine bathfoams Sofitel branded.I did really enjoy my short stay, I do really recommend this french style hotel to everyone visiting Amsterdam both for leisure and business (try the internet access on a 28 screen in your room!!).

<Content>Great location Stayed here on a stag do recently. Great location as everything is easy walking distance, whether it's the train station, the red light area or generally just wondering around. The hotel rooms are quite cosy, but that didn't really matter as they are well fitted and really only a base for the night. The hotel staff are very helpful, polite and friendly. Would definitely use the hotel again for a weekend. Not sure if the rooms are big enough for kids?

<Author>Hampshire-resident
<Content>The best bed .... ever! Spent 3 nights here at the end of May. Got an excellent rate (only about 20 Euros more than the Ibis at the station was charging). The hotel is within easy walking distance of the central station, the Dam Square, and most of the major sights of Amsterdam. Check in was efficient and all of the staff were courteous. There was no real view out of the room - the window overlooked the back of another property, but at night this meant that the room was very quiet. The room was extremely well appointed - I would describe the size as adequate - I was staying alone so the fact that there was only one easy chair wasn't a problem, but had I been sharing, this would have been annoying. I was slightly surprised that there was no room safe. Excellent air conditioning. Breakfast was 22 Euros - expensive but very good and took the place of lunch on the two days that I had it. Try Humphrey's restaurant for an excellent value (3 courses for 19 Euros) dinner - turn right out of the hotel, take the first wide street on the right and it's on the right. The bed was unbelievably comfortable - 3 excellent nights' sleep - and information in the room about where I could have bought one. If you can get a good deal on this hotel, stay at it.

This hotel has the best showers I have ever seen in a hotel, it was fabulous and the beds were the most comfortable with all the down pillows and comforters, it was had to get up in the morning. The breakfast which was included had evertyhing you could want and was excellent. We faced the street and did not hear anything very quiet. I would love to stay here again.

<Content>Beware of a con ! Hotel is fine. Rooms as expected.Don't get a room next to the alley, people up drinking til 5 in the morning, then the road sweeper to contend with an hour after that.Booked on-line, the print off gives the impression breakfast is paid for in the room rate. Nothing said when checking in. Explaination where the hotel facilities were etc.2 of us had a pot of coffee in the morning , charged 44 euro ( 拢30)................ for a pot of coffee !!!!!!!!!!Even the receptionist agreed the booking for breakfast was mis-leading, the hotel director gave the usual company line.Stayed in many Accor chain hotels all across europe , without issue. Never again ! Unless I get a reasonable refund.

<Content>Excellent Sofitel I have just returned from a weekend in Amsterdam, staying in the Sofitel. This hotel is in a central location only a two minute walk from Dam Square and five minutes from Central Station. Check in was fast and very freindly, our room was a good size and in good order. The Sofitel beds are legendary and are without doubt, the most comfartable you will find anywhere.  Breakfast was included in our rate and was excellent, with a fantastic selection. The Windsor bar within the hotel is a haven of calm in which to retreat from the hectic city centre, it has a very laid back atmosphere and the bar staff were very attentive and freindly.  A very good choice.

<Content>Perect home away from home. This was the perfect first hotel to stay at in Amsterdam. The room was cozy, clean and for us, non smoking. The breakfast which was included was the fabulous buffet with everything from crepes to scrambled eggs, bacon, smoked salmon, fruit and on and on. It was so nice not to have to hunt down somewhere for the breakfast meal, have it there, relax and plan the day. We also ate one dinner meal at the hotel-it also was very good. Nice staff.Excellent location, easy walk to train station, Dam Square, etc.

<Content>Decent Hotel A good place to stay in Amsterdam. Staff were friendly and gave us a decent room at the front of the hotel. The bed was amazing! Batchroom was fine but the water wasn't as hot as we are used to.We didn't spend much time in the hotel, but suffice to say it is close to everything.It is worth joining the Sofitel Awards program (free) which allows a late 4pm checkout.

<Content>Lovely hotel with amazing bed! This hotel is a perfectly situated near the Jordan district and great for walking the canals.I arrived at 7AM off an overseas flight, very tired, and hoping for a comfortable hotel. I was greeted warmly and given a room for early check-in. I stayed for 3 nights and had nothing but great service from a very helpful and warm staff.The room was small, but as I was a single traveller, it was perfect for one. The bed was extremely comfortable (best hotel bed I have had in long time), and the ammenities were plentiful. Great breakfast and nice bar for end of day drinks.I would come back to Sofitel, whenever and wherever!

It was a pleasent surprise! The only thing is hotel is a little smaller than other Sofitels we are used to.The room is small but the bed is amazing. Room service was excellent but the buffet was expensive. Overall, I would definitely stay there again. Highly recommended.

<Content>Wonderful staff, all in all a fine experience The best thing about this hotel was the staff. Every single member of staff I had any interaction with was polite, friendly, and helpful. The next best thing was the bed. Extremely comfortable.The rooms was immaculate and in good order. The gentleman's club look wasn't particularly to my taste, but hey, that's a minor point. Good location, near the railway station, on the edge of the old city with all the attractions within easy reach. My only issue was street noise from an argument at 5am one morning. Other than that, the hotel was a 5, and the staff 5+.

<Content>Excellent Beds and great location Excellent location 5min walk from Central Station. The hotel has a nice bar but the prices are off the scale. The rooms are well furnished with and have a small fridge, loads of TV channels with many shows in English, the beds are so comfy I found it hard to get out of it. We had a room that looks over to some other rooms which was lovely and quite day and night.The only let down was the staff. We opened a can of diet coke from the minibar when we arrived, half way through the drink my partner noticed the expiry on the bottom of the can was May 06! When I took it down to the reception the next day along with a second can I found in the mini bar dated Sept06 I asked to speak to the Hotel manager I got to speak to the assistant FB manager who was clueless. He said he would look into it and get back to me, which he never did! Very bad service since they were selling out of date products, I will write to their head office since they didn't seem intrested in the hotel.

<Content>Good location but decor needs updating Myself and my partner have just returned from a two night stay in this hotel. The location is definitely the highlight of this hotel. I requested a room with a front facing view and thats what I got. I was slightly disappointed with the size and decor of the room compared to other Sofitels I've stayed in. We got a free drinks voucher which was a nice touch and they also left a little teddy on the bed. The staff were friendly albeit a sarcastic man at reception who made a bit of a song and dance over our reservation.Overall this was a nice hotel but not really in 4 star league imo. I would recommend staying if you get a good value rate as the location is excellent.

<Content>Best jhotel beds I have had for a long time! Stayed for 2 nights at the beginning of February. Great location and within walking distance to most attractions. Lovely staff who were very helpful and friendly. We were upgraded free of charge to Exec rooms as we had two rooms booked and wanted to be on the same floor which was very nice of them. The rooms were huge by european standards and very comfortable. We had a room facing the street and while there was a bit of noise from the trams it was quite quiet at night. If you are a light sleeper though you may wish to request a room at the back of the property. Best thing about the rooms was the beds. Lovely, huge, comfortable beds with feather pads on top of the mattresses and lovely feather pillows. Would stay again just for the good night's sleep!

<Content>Good location but very poor housekeeping, among others... First the good part. It's at a good location, near Central station, tram stop and many attractions.That's pretty much where the good part stops.The hotel is small, but not intimiate like a boutique hotel. It claims to be 4-star but more like a 3-star compared to others.Rooms are quite small. Bathroom small and old. No shower curtain. Shower pressure painfully low, almost like a drip, any time of the day. No newspaper delivery to the room in the morning, not even if you ask.The worst part is the quality of the housekeeping. Shower tub filled with human hair of varying lengths and degree of curliness. Lots of hairs on the floor. After complaining to the front desk and return to the room in the evening to find more hair on the floor. Laundry bag (filled with form filled out) left on the bag not picked up (even though the tip underneath was well noticed by housekeeper and taken).I feel when a 4-star hotel can't even keep hair off of floors and bathtubs, and housekeeping staff poorly trained or simply don't care, the hotel has lost its soul and management probably do not care either.The othe Sofitel, the Grand Demeur, is much nicer and service much better.

<Content>Excellent stay in a comfortable hotel We liked this hotel very much. 2 night stay booked via the hotel鈥檚 website. They upgraded us from a deluxe room to an executive room on arrival - with welcoming chocolate, Evian water, bath pearls and a teddy bear too鈥oucher for free drinks in the bar was also handed out at reception along with a useful map and some other information. The welcome was warm and sincere - a nice touch.The room was at the front of the hotel (250) and had 3 large windows, a huge blissfully comfortable bed, a bathroom with a double shower and a separate WC. Storage was more than adequate and robes and slippers were also provided. Although the trams run outside, there was hardly any noise and I slept 8 hours without waking once (extremely rare for me). Breakfast was served downstairs (just off the lobby) with a good selection of hot and cold food - all good quality and the service was again cheerful and efficient. We didn鈥檛 eat an evening meal at the hotel so I cannot comment on the restaurant menu.The location is superb. It鈥檚 a short walk from the central Station - easy even with medium roll along luggage, although you could get a taxi or a tram if you were feeling lazy or have mobility problems. Dam Sq. is a short walk away, as is the Jordaan area (Anne Frank鈥檚 house etc.) and the canal stop to get sightseeing boats. The hotel can give you any information you need.A great stay and we would definitely choose this one again

<Content>Solid and Steady I stayed at the Sofitel this September while visiting Amsterdam and found the hotel to deliver a solid if not overly luxurious experience. Then again, it was far from the most expensive hotel we considered. It is clean, very very well located and helpful. I did ask to change rooms, my first one was strangely infested with mosquitoes....and they did to a much better one. Kind of funky old decor and best of all, a bowl of apples in the lobby. Can't say enough about the location, step out the door and you can go anywhere in the city.

<Content>Long stay at the Sofitel! My work brought me to Amsterdam for an extended stay and I really enjoyed the Sofitel! During my various stays, I was booked in a couple of different rooms, which gave me a good overview of the hotel. First, the rooms in the 500's are on the front of the building and they are very spacious. I believe I stayed in 502 and it had a lot of room and a big bathroom. Some of the rooms on the back of the building tend to be smaller. I always asked and they would move me once they had room. I would recommend asking for a room with space if you feel cramped. They were really nice about moving rooms.The double and kind beds are really comfortable! I think that when you are away from home, there is nothing more important than a comfortable bed. After staying in other Amsterdam hotels that are in the center of the city, none of those beds even compare to the Sofitel.Location: You cannot beat this location! First, the train station is only a 5-7 minute walk away. I took the train from the airport to the hotel multiple times. It was quicker than a cab ride and the walk was really easy. Second, it is close to Dam Square and backs up to a ton of great shopping. Third, it is close to the Singel canal that was a lot of great places to eat.Complaints -- I think that the room service menu could be updated. I do, however, recommend the pizza and the burger selection. Their wine selection for room service is also pretty good. My second complaint is the fitness center. There is hardly anything down there (only a rowing machine and a bike). That being said, most of the hotels in Amsterdam are lacking on the fitness center.I would not hesitate to stay here again! If you are in Amsterdam for an extended stay, no hotel will be nicer to deal with!

<Content>Lovely Hotel Excellent stay, hotel is in a great location and the rooms are good, well sized, bathroom was good size. Very clean well kept. The beds are the most comfortable ever, like a massive marshmallow! The breakfast is brilliant, with loads of choice, restaurant, amenities, staff all brilliant. Would recommend.Only downside I can think of is that as stated by others reviews, they do not provide much in the tea/coffee making kit, but the card said that you could have more if

<Content>Pleasant Stay My girlfriend and I recently stayed 4 nights at the Sofitel Amsterdam. As others have written, the hotel is very conveniently located. I paid euro 119 per night by paying for the room at the time of booking. (There was an extra 5% city tax, which was clearly explained on my reservation confirmation). For the rate I believe it was an excellent value. I may have been a bit disappointed if I had paid much more for the room.The room was very small by American standards. I have stayed in other hotels in Europe, but I expected a little more room in a 4 star hotel. There was barely enough space to hang our clothes. The bed was soft and comfortable. The bathroom was big enough and the shower was okay. The toiletries and towels were great. The curtains were dark and allowed us to sleep late in the mornings. The hotel was also very quiet. We never heard any noise outside of our room.The hotel staff was all friendly and helpful. As mentioned by a few others we were able to get our room upon arrival in the morning. it was great to get a shower and a nap after our transatlantic flight.We did not eat in the the restaurant. We did eat dinner at a small Italian restaurant Napoli(?) next door to the hotel. The food was nothing special, but it was reasonably priced and it was worth going to if you want to stay near the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Amsterdam for leisure or business travel.

<Content>Fantastic stay! Had a wonderful time in Amsterdam. To be honest, was expecting the worst, i.e.; small room, no view, etc. Our room was spectacular. We had an entire wall of windows looking out onto the street. The room was large as was the bathroom. It was really lovely. The only negative is that the shower is not great - - basically a handheld. However, the room, the view, the service, the bed, the bar, the check in/out experiences were all superb. The location of the hotel is great - - within walking distance of everything but off the main drag - - avoiding noise, crowds, etc. Easy walk to the train station - - much better value to get to/from the airport than a taxi. Coffee bars, restaurants, etc. all within steps. Supermarket about a half a block down the road, as is Dam Square. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Mediocre Positive points of the hotel were:- the excellent central location;- OK sized room; - the divinely soft bed.However:- the decor was dated (and hideous);- they tried to make me pay a city charge which they had not informed me about when I booked - I was under the impression I had pre-paid for everything (though they did eventually give me the benefit of the doubt which was good);- our key card didn't always work; and- the shower was REALLY pathetic.Service was friendly enough but overall the hotel was probably not quite what I was expecting/hoping for.Overall, a mediocre experience.

<Content>Dissappointing - not good value We stayed here for a weekend and found the room quite small and the corridor carpet in need of a clean. The tea and coffee facilities were mean - ie. only one teabag, one coffee sachet etc - and were not replenished every day.There was a fair amount of noise from the lift, and from the air conditioning unit outside.One of the front desk staff was fairly unsympathetic when we needed to consult with a doctor - and had an unfortunate manner when it came to slapping on the extra 5% city tax at checkout time!The 'mybed' bed, however, was fantastic - big and soft - and all of the other staff we came across were very pleasant and helpful.In the past we've stayed in various Novotels and other hotels in the accor hotel chain, in different European countries, and been impressed with the service, convenience and value we received. This was a special weekend trip (birthday) - so we thought we go 'upmarket' an try out a Sofitel - and it ended up being dissappointing - perhaps we would have been happier in the Ibis...

<Content>What a gem This is a great place to stay when in Amsterdam. The hotel was clean, quiet and in a great location. The staff was extremely knowledgable and patient with all of our questions. They even helped us figure out the metro schedules. The room had high ceilings and this fabulous down bed that was very hard to get out of in the morning. The bathroom was large and very clean. The morning breakfast was wonderful and had lots of variety. The area was full of restaruants and littel pastry and coffee shops and close enough to Dam square and the train station to get to anything else we wanted to see. I felt like the Sofitel was my little nest that I could then go out and explore knowing it was waiting for me at the end of the day. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.

<Content>Great Location  My experience was generally consistent with the other reviews. The location is indeed convenient to the train station, although you may want to take the Tram (#1) if you have a lot of luggage since it is about 2-3 blocks away. The Tram stops right in front of the hotel. The hotel is centrally located within walking distance to many of the popular tourist locations, or you can hop the Tram at Centraal station to just about anywhere in the city. The service was friendly and professional. Check in/out was very efficient, and my requests were responded to quickly and courteously. My only criticism is the condition of the room seemed a bit past it's prime. While it was certainly clean and quiet, the carpeting, paint and furnishings definitely appeared worn and as typical for European rooms, was a bit cramped. The exception to this was the bed linens, which as others have described, were luxurious and comfortable if you like a soft bed. The bathroom was small, but functional and well stocked with quality toiletries and towels.I booked this with only a couple of days notice and paid an average of 176 euros per night for a 3 night weekend stay, which I thought was a bit pricey given the condition of the room. However, my experience was certainly enjoyable and I would return if I could get a better rate with a more advance booking.

<Content>A nice one in Europe We had nice experience with this hotel. Location is convenient, though you still need to walk about 5 minutes from the main train station (not far, but it matters when you have luggages). Room is clean with comfortable bed, not big not reasonable and with AC!

<Content>I felt like a queen! This hotel was an excellent stay! I ended my two week European/African journey with one more night in Amsterdam. I was originally scheduled to stay in a hostel but wanted some luxury so I booked this hotel through tripadvisor.com. The queen sized bed was luxurious, with a beautiful down comfortor and tons of pillows. The bathroom was large and came with some great amenities. The staff were friendly and courteous. The location is great and it is two streets down from Damrak, one of the major streets in downtown Amsterdam! I would highly recommned this hotel to anyone!

<Content>I Loved Loved Loved this Hotel!!! :) All your reviews helped me turn down the Lloyd  be happy I couldn't get the Krasnapolsky (for my tastes, terrible environs both)  look forward to Sofitel Amsterdam (I didn't book this hotel myself), where I spent 5 nights: July 11-15, 2006. Despite some miscommunications in obtaining replies via email re reservation confirmations  other questions, which were ultimately solved by their toll-free telephone customer relations staff ,and getting trapped in the tiny elevator the very first afternoon I was there (despite being really something, considering how terrified I was because I am claustrophobic!), the hotel surpassed even your generous reviews! The Sofitel Amsterdam was very convenient to most of the tram lines (within a few blocks walk to all)  an easy 10-minute walk from the Centraal Station, the GVB  VVV offices, on a very quiet, though not deserted street, 2 blocks from my very favorite Amsterdam neighborhood, the Jordaan, where I walked nightly, a woman alone, late at night, completely without fear! The Sofitel Amsterdam was also the definiton of luxury:Pictures, while lovely, do not do this place justice! While simple (my personal style preference to overdone ornate ostentation), this hotel exudes understated elegance: On the 3rd floor non-smoking floor, facing a very quiet back alley, but facing a brick wall which opened just in front of my window to part of a rooftop, allowing me alone a bit of morning sun, my room was ideal: from the dreamy king size bed, with its silky sheets  down pillows,-- like sleeping on a cloud!....to the generous lighting  storage facilities...to the spotless bathroom, with hairdryer, soaps  shampoos, luscious towels, terry robe  slippers for my use......to the phone message system hooked into the TV (which provided free TV in 8 languages-- good for me to practice my growing Dutch vocabulary!)..........to the hot water boiler  instant teas/coffee provided free to those of us in need of caffeine immediately on waking.....to the thoughtful card left on my pillow each night providing me with the next day's weather forecast! (very very useful)......... The breakfast buffet, which I thought would be wasted on a small eater like me, was presented in a simple but bright room filled with prints of paintings by Gustav Klimt (one of my favorite artists), the tables dressed in simple but fine linen  china. The self-service buffet amazed me with its variety, anticipating every possible taste,  the pleasant staff acccommodated all requests instantly....including endless personal pots of coffee, cappucino, etc.......the fresh kiwi juice was a daily extravagance! :) :) The hotel service also was excellent...........When my room was not ready upon my arrival, the concierge arranged for the porter to store my luggage until it was; a safety deposit box was available without charge; one night a very nice concierge checked the kitchen closing time (unfortunately, it took me a while to get used to the early restaurant closing times in Amsterdam) of a nearby cafe; on my last morning, my request for an early morning wakeup call, usually automated, was backed up by a personal call by that morning's concierge, concerned that I not miss my early plane. The Brazilian lady who ran the breakfast room, was warm sunshine (!)- whose smile  friendliness (as some of the other staff) I looked forward to every morning! What an angel! :) And even some of the concierges, at first a bit formal for my simple American, New York bohemian artist tastes, eventually warmed up..........I was particularly delighted when, upon my departure, the extremely formal concierge who greeted me so formally on my arrival just days before, broke into the brightest of smiles when I told him that the Sofitel Amsterdam is the best hotel I have ever stayed at! :) (I admit that getting this hotel/breakfast as part of a trip that I won may have colored my views-- but I doubt it! I had always thought that the vacation destination mattered more than the hotel, but I am now spoiled forever!)

<Content>Great hotel with a superb location Great hotel with a superb location in the heart of Amsterdam within easy reach of basically all sights (walking distance to most sights, moreover there's a tram stop near the hotel and the central station is a short walk away). Booking well in advance should get you a good rate for the room. Rooms are nicely decorated, reasonably spacious and clean. In the rooms facing the street one may be a bit disturbed by the noise, so if that matters for you, try to get a room facing the back yard. Breakfast is nice, but in my opinion a bit overpriced (at 22 EUR per person per breakfast); however sometimes you might be able to find good deals including breakfast. If not, there are plenty of cafes offering breakfast at competitive rates in the area, which should suit all tastes. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. In short - a perfect hotel for your stay in Amsterdam!

<Content>Great room and location! I booked a web deal one month in advance for my husbands 40th birthday and paid a bit more for an 'executive' room.We were not disappointed - the room was excellent overlooking the front street but no noise at all. Fantastic bed! High ceilings and good decor. Everything was really clean. Cannot fault anything with the room.Staff were really friendly and we had complimentary cocktails in the bar.Only niggle would be the breakfast which was a bit disappointing - the choice was quite limited as when something ran out they took ages to serve more. I had read this on other reviews but decided to go for it as its more convenient than going down the road somewhere else at that time of the morning! If we go back to the hotel we would probably skip breakfast and just go room only.

<Content>Exceeded our expectations Having been highly impressed with the New York Sofitel, I decided to book the same brand in Amsterdam as a birthday treat for my husband.I was not disappointed.I booked through the Sofitel website, and was pleased with the deal at 119 euros for one night in a standard room. I mentioned when booking that it was a birthday suprise for my husband. We went to the hotel from the airport at 11am not expecting to be able to check in, but hoping to leave our bags. We were able to check in though, and a delightful, friendly male receptionist wished my husband a happy birthday and upgraded us to one of the suites.He gave us a map and lots of local info and could not have been more heplful.Our room was fantastic, huge, with a seperate sitting area and a massive bed, everything was of the highest qulaity and spotless. I could not fault it. When we went out in the afternoon, we returned to find a birthday card and chocolates from the hotel, a lovely touch.We also had a free drink from the hotel and spent a very pleasant couple of hours in the cosy bar area. The barman makes a wicked Margarita!I cannot recommend the hotel highly enough, it's location is also great.I would certainly use it again.

<Content>Heavenly! Luxurious! Affordable! I spent one night here during a stopover from Asia en route to the US. I arrived cold and miserable at 9 AM and was delighted when the friendly clerk found a room for me five hours before check in! I booked the room the week before on expedia for 119E ($144) and wasn't expecting much but wow! This room could easily cost twice as much. The room was small, modern, spick and span clean, and well appointed. The bed had a featherbed mattress and a fluffy white duvet under which I slept soundly, jetlag notwithstanding. When I woke up, I stayed in bed because it was so comfortable!!! The bathroom was clean with upscale toiletries and a deep soaking tub. I didn't order from room service but the prices looked reasonable. There is apparently a fitness room. This review is not doing this gem of a hotel justice - go and see for yourself!

<Content>Very good hotel Very good hotel, with an excellent location and an amazing tram connection.It has the 5 major trams connecting the city stopping in front of it.It is mid way between the Dam square and the central station.The only downside of the hotel is that they lack terribly the concierge service and the staff is not even able to say when a mall closes or recommend a night club or a restaurant

<Content>Excellent Hotel During our recent 5 week 6 European cities tour we stayed in many very good hotels. 2 stand out. For sheer elegance, grandeur and position, one is the Raffles Palace in Montreux. However, the best all round winner is the Sofitel Amsterdam.This is because it represents better value for money and because every staff member at every level makes you feel welcome and important. I would seriously consider making a trip to Amsterdam just to be able to stay at this great hotel again.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Excellent Staff, Very Friendly, Honest!! The hotel is very close to Centrum Station, walking there to and from is not a problem. Convenient to all areas by foot or tram that stops right outside the hotel.We checked in with two very nice and helpful front desk personnel. They were very eager to tell us all about the area and made sure to tell us that when we were ready they would go thoughly over the map of the city with us. Then they gave us a voucher for 2 free drinks in the lounge! A bell man brought our bags to our room for us, nice touch.The room was big enough for 2 and the bathroom was very nice with really nice ameneties. The bed was a little hard for me, but for only two nights, not a big deal.On our last night, I asked the bartender to change a 50 euro note for me, but wanted to charge our drinks to the room, it came to around 15 euro. When he gave me my change I didn't bother to count. Later that night, I realized that he had shorted me, and the amount seemed to add up to the drinks, which I had already signed to the room. We went back and asked him about it, but he said he was sure that he gave us the change correctly. Long story short, the next morning when we were checking out, there was an envelope from the bartender with a note that in fact when he counted out that night, he was over, and gave us our money!!! I couldn't believe it!!! Amsterdam is a beautiful city, lot's of fun and when I go back, I would definitely stay here again. Good Job!!!

<Content>Good but not Great I had just stayed at the London Sofitel so my expectations were high. Unfortunately, they were not met. The hotel location is excellent and is central to anything one would want to do in Amsterdam. The check-in was okay, but it seemed liked the front desk was always short-staffed. I was attempting to use the business center to check e-mail and found it didn't work but could get anyone from the desk to assist as they were swamped with check-ins. The next morning they were swamped with check-outs.The room was small and the bed was not that comfortable. The room was facing the back alley and was noisey. It was hard to sleep past 5:00 am with all the noise, especially since I was still partly on U.S. time.I'd say the staff were generally helpful but seemed overworked boardering on burnout. The bellman was great though overworked as well trying to get cabs, move luggage, etc. They seemed to have a lot of tour groups coming through which always seems to overload a place. The room service was overpriced at 鈧?0 for continental and the rolls still had adhesive labels on them! The room at 鈧?40 excluding breakfast was overpriced.

<Content>Very good hotel I stayed at this hotel last January and i liked it very much. Very good location, near the center but in a very pleasant and safe avenue, near the Central Station too (if you don't want to take a bus, you can walk). My room was not that big, but it had all I need for a 5 day stay (including coffee and tea facilities, which is very comfortable when outside is snowing!). My room was also very charming, with traditional wood celing. I also liked very much the staff, always very kind. I just don't give this hotel an Excellent because the normal price is very expensive. I bought it at a special price (99鈧?, that's why I stayed there.

<Content>comfortable but small Very good hotel but room relatively small considering the rack rate. Better value for off season/internet etc reservations. Excellent location for rail station (but not too close) and trams etc. Buffet breakfast a little pricey for what's on offer. Would go back depending on room prices.
