<Content>One of the best city hotels in the world There's probably not much that hasn't been said already, but Le Meurice is one of the loveliest hotels we've visited--and by far the most relaxing and luxurious in Paris. My husband and I spent six days there last month and loved every minute of it. The staff went out of their way to predict and accommodate our every need. I walked through the front door holding a bouquet of flowers, and tI was immediately approached by a front desk employee who asked if he may cut them, place them in a vase, and have them delivered to my room. Another time, I asked the front desk to recommend a place we could buy a cheap curling iron since the different voltage had fried the one I brought. The gentleman looked at me in horror and said, Why, we should certainly have curling irons here. You needn't spend your time in Paris looking for something like that. It's our mistake for not thinking of it, but please, allow us to find you one. An hour later there was a brand new curling iron in our room with a note of apology for the delay. They had gone and purchased a bunch on their own to keep on hand for guests in the future! Our room was lovely and the bed the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever experienced. Every day we were surprised with a plate of different, amazing pastries. The lobby was a great combination of chic and comfortingly traditional and great for people-watching. My only complaint was the astronomical cost of food--28 Euros for a club sandwich in the bar--but this is Paris and it's to be expected. Overall, we will gladly return to Le Meurice.

<Content>You could be nowhere but Paris and that's a good thing! We recently spent a weekend at Le Meurice and had an excellent stay.What I really appreciated about Le Meurice - as well as the superb, very personal service and perfect location - was that it felt utterly Parisian.Our junior suite had recently been refurbished (design by Philippe Starck) but it was the epitome of Parsisan chic - floor to ceiling windows, dressed by acres of luxurious drapes, stylish sofas beautifully upholstered, a large vase full of perfect roses. But the suite also had a large flat screen TV, a his and hers dressing room (4 wardrobes) that I wish I could have in my own home and an enormous marble bathroom. We were travelling with our 9 year old son and received a perfect restaurant recommendation from the Concierge for a local bistro that was more casual in style than the hotel's own 3 Michelin-starred temple to gastronomy (but we had a most enjoyable breakfast in there).On the Saturday evening we had a drink in the bar after our meal. It was very busy (no sign of credit crunch at Le Meurice) and had an excellent atmosphere. The hotel's public areas are not that large, but the hotel has a stylish and sophisticated feel, with consistent service throughout.All staff were helpful and keen to please. We really like the staff at the Dorchester Collection hotels and chose Le Meurice following a jaw-dropping stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel in the summer. We find the service really does go the extra mile and is less formulaic than at some of the other luxury groups. Anyone who has trouble with the service has got to be doing something wrong! Maybe guests should remember that they are in France, not USA and the service ethos is different but certainly not lacking here.

<Content>Hotel Le Meurice The Epitomy of Luxury! My husband and I travel frequently and like to stay in very nice accommodations. We both agree that this is most likely the most luxurious hotel we've ever stayed in! Our room was large (even for US standards) and luxurious with wonderful pillows and down comforter. The marble bathroom had a seperate tub and stall shower (that had unbeleivable pressure). The towels were also large and luxurious. The concierges were incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. The lobby doubles as one of the restuarnats but it is great place to sit and have a cup of tea or coffee in the afternoon. The location is also terrific - right across the street from the Tuilleries Gardens and just a few blocks from the Louvre. Of course all of this comes at a price - but it was so worth every penny!

<Content>Great Location, Lovely Hotel We stayed at the Meurice just before Thanksgiving in November 2007. The day we arrived in Paris a transportation strike had begun. It literally began the day we arrived--we had read about the impending strike the day before in the American newspapers. Luckily, the hotel had already booked someone to meet us at our gate. This person ushered us through customs, helped us retrieve our luggage and euros from the ATM and brought us right to our waiting car and driver. Thank goodness for that because there was no other way out of the airport! We arrived at the hotel in the very early a.m. and the staff was ready to greet us. We sat at the little desk in the reception area and they helped us through all of our plans in terms of museum tickets, etc.. We had planned to go to Versailles and also had made many restaurant reservations prior to our arrival. These were now in jeopardy because there were no taxis, trains or metro. The hotel was very helpful in ordering chauffered cars for us for everything. This was a huge added expense, but some of the pain was taking away by how wonderfully gracious they were in handling everything. Our room was prepared immediately and we were able to go in and rest right away. Room service was excellent, decor and cleanliness were top notch. Our view was of a courtyard which was as expected. The staff was friendly and helpful. When we had (many) technical problems with the DVD player and the stereo they came and replaced the entire system. The day we went to Versailles we were celebrating our anniversary and we returned to a lovely bottle of champagne with special treats.There are two wonderful things about this hotel: the location--can't beat it--and the staff. On our last day we were flying to Rome on an early (7 a.m.) flight. We had ordered the car for 4:30 a.m.. We came down, the car was packed and ready to go. As we were leaving, the concierge asked us if we would like him to confirm our flight to Rome. Guess what? The air traffic controllers at Orly had decided to join the transport strike. We were to be meeting some officials at the Vatican as we were renewing our wedding vows at the Vatican on Thanksgiving Day. The staff at the hotel literally got on the phone and started to see what they could do to get us out of Charles De Gaulle. They sent us back up to our room (free of charge) for hours while they booked us new flights. This saved our vacation.I have heard great things about the Four Seasons Georges V, but I must say The Meurice holds up in terms of service and location.

<Content>Not a palace... We chose the Meurice because we had herd it was one of the first palaces in Paris, and we have stayed at its sister hotel The Dorchester many satisfying times.Location is good. The hotel doesn't have very many rooms, but the lobby is way too small. It is basicly a combination of the reception, an entry way better known as a couch, the casual restaurant, and the bar. It was pretty, but I guess it could have been better enjoyed if it wasn't so crowded.I know it is cliche to say that the Parisians are rude towards Americans. But I think it is more that they don't enjoy speaking english since they are native french. We were encountered many times with arrogant staff. I am not paying over two thousand euros a night to get a cold shoulder.The suite was nice. A deluxe garden view. It was small for the price, but nevertheless very nice. It was difficult to see the garden and the eiffel tower. If you do decided to stay here, don't pay the money for the garden view.Food: Restaurant Le Meurice was great. Great food and service. It will cost you about 400 euros with wine. If you are looking for star french cuisine, look at Ducasse. He is at the Plaza, and Jules Verne at the Eiffel tower (we had Jules Verne; the view was pretty, food bland). Funny enough, the best French cuisine we had on the trip (between Paris and London) was Ducasse's Restaurant at the Dorchester in London. Back to the Meurice...skip the casual restaurant. It had a boring menu and lazy service.This hotel is beautiful. However if you enjoy fantastic service at a hotel it truly can't recommend the Meurice. Try the Park Hyatt...its at Vendome and is an understated hotel. And you can't go wrong with the Four Seasons. We booked a driver through the Meurice to give us a day tour, and he told us that he also works for the Four Seasons, and that they try to hard. We thought to ourselves 'well that can't be that bad because the Meurice isn't trying hard enough'....

<Content>Wonderful stay I had high expectations of Le Meurice given the cost but I can confirm these were exceeded in every way.We booked 2 de luxe adjoining rooms for 3 nights for me, my wife and children (13 and 11). These were courtyard rooms as I wanted peace at night and they were indeed very quiet. The rooms were well appointed, very comfortable and spacious. The bathrooms were opulent and spacious as well.The welcome was most unParisian-warm and helpful-nothing was too much trouble. There was always plenty of staff to deal with every query we had.The concierge staff were truly outstanding-we had a long list of things we needed and they were equal to the tasks in every way. Their restaurant recommendations were particularly good.We ate a number of excellent meals in the hotel including one dinner in the 3 star restaurant. The cost of dinner is eye watering particularly if you choose a decent wine but it is worth every penny. I've had a large number of meals in many top class restaurants but this has to be in my top 3 ever. My 11 yo son is still telling people his langoustines were the nicest thing he has ever tasted. Finally, the location is second to none-everything you need to see is within walking distance if the weather is ok.If Le Meurice can maintain these standards there really is nowhere else to stay in Paris-and I've been to the George V.One other point which you may find useful-don't bother with Angelina's next door. Despite allegedly having the best cakes and hot chocolate in Paris, it failed again (I'd had lunch there with clients last time I was in Paris) - noisy, poor quality cakes, awful service and expensive. We had Le Meurice's afternoon tea which was everything it should have been though pricey but worth it.

<Content>Parisian Luxury and Location We had a wonderful stay at Le Meurice from start to finish. We checked in very early Monday morning after a red-eye flight, and our room was ready for us - we were taken right upstairs to a lovely room at 8:00 AM. The lobby has just undergone an extensive renovation and is a delightful place to enjoy an after-dinner drink (if you can swallow the high price, as in much of Paris). Our room was reasonably-sized, for Europe, with a very comfortable bed and beautiful Italian-marble bathroom with plenty of room to spread out. The location is really key to this property- right across the street from the Jardin de Tuilleries, an 8-minute walk to the Louvre, 10-minutes to the Musee de Orsay, 20 minutes to the shopping of the Champs d'Elysee.One money-saving tip - skip the breakfast here and go next door to Angelina's, where the coffee and croissants are just as good for about half the price.

<Content>Wonderful View The interior of the lobby is gorgeous. For those of you that are Philipe Starck fans like me - you will be pleased. The service is good, the food isn't good though. I was disappointed in the room service food, we did not eat at any of the restaraunts in the hotel. The people that come in and out are pretty snooty. I love five-star hotels, but it was a little much. But it is Paris afterall. I am by no means a schlep - I wear labels too, but I at least smile. Anywho, the staff was very friendly upon arrival. I had trouble with my credit cards working in Europe and they were really nice about it. Most hotels would have been frustrated with the customer, but they were more than happy to help in contacting my bank, etc. The view - we booked a room with a view on the 6th floor. It was phenomenal! My daughter looked out the terrace everynight and watched the Eiffel Tower twinkle. That in itself was worth every penny. They provided my daughter with a stuffed puppy and a puzzle. She enjoyed that. The food for the kids is better than the adults!The bathroom was gorgeous. We booked a double deluxe garden view. The bathroom had two pedestal sinks and a terrace with a view. The bedroom was a king...the european way of pushing two twins together! But the room was very elegant. My only grievance is the check-out. We checked-out at 4am and were catching a flight to Nice and the lady at the desk was not very helpful. I called the concierge in advance for help with directions once we got to Nice. I had lost my directions from the Nice Airport to the Four Seasons and was hoping he could help me because I wasn't sure if I would get a lot of help in the Nice airport. When I asked him to print off directions from the net, he said right now?. Uh, no - 10 minutes after I leave. What could he possibly be so busy with at 4am? He printed out the map. It had a dot where Nice was and a dot where the hotel is. No instructions. He wasn't a lot of help and couldn't understand what I really needed - and I was speaking French!Overall, a very nice hotel. I may try another next time I go, but I would recommend the hotel based on the view and the location. The service is good - I left very happy, but a little less happy once I experienced the Four Seasons in Provence - see my review there. If you book a room here - make sure you request a view! It wasn't noisy either!

<Content>What a treat! We stayed at the Meurice for a weekend break. When arriving at the hotel we found our Deluxe Double room on the fifth floor, overlooking Les Tuileries gardens, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and the Musee D'Orsay in perfect condition. The service at the hotel, whether it is in the bar or the restaurant, is outstanding. The room where the breakfast is being served, which is also where the three star Michelin restaurant is located, is the most beautiful room you can imagine. Everything comes at a price at this place but every EURO spent is worth it.

<Content>Fantastic looking hotel interior Nice hut! The room wasn't ready when we first arrived and after a short jaunt around the museum found it still wasnt ok by 3pm which as we had travelled for some time was a bit rough. They sorted us out with a different room without a view (which I had paid extra for) but the room was of a very high standard. Nice marble everywhere and suitably impressive decor.Breakfast was unusual, the eggs had to be the nicest poached eggs I've ever had and the fruit was very fresh. The cost of it was fairly prohibitive (around 100 Euros for two) and to be honest I could have done with something less well designed on the plate and more substantial. maybe something around the perfect bacon and croisants to go with the egg eh?Maybe I'm dulled by these things because I've stayed in a fair quantity of 4/5* but I was hoping for an experience here and it didnt really happen. I wouldnt say this wasnt a 5* I'd just put it down to the bottom end of a 5* experience. Stay again?... maybe ... I wouldnt turn it down if it was free, but would Ipay a premium for it... Nope!

<Content>A Rich History - No longer the great hotel Not only due to the current rennovations were we let down at the famous Le Meurice. The general atmosphere is no where as exciting as other hotels in the same league as this hotel. Our bathroom door had a broken door handle, a hanger had been was left under the dresser and a requested kingsize bed was two beds pushed together with a Kingsize sheet and bedding. At night hallway lights are reduced making the halls dark and depressing, carpets are marked. Sure you can pay 680euros for 50g of Beluga caviar in the lobby bar. The excitement however is long gone. What a huge dissapointment.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel; Great Service; Beware of Value Le Meurice is a beautiful, elegant hotel with first-rate service in a good (but not necessarily great, depending on what you're looking for) location.This was our first time in Paris and we were looking for an upscale hotel in a location that would enable us to do a lot of easy sightseeing. The first things that struck us when we walked into Le Meurice were the beautiful lobby, the magnificently-decorated restaurant, and the very attentive staff. A word of caution: if you're looking to be casual on your trip, such as by walking around in shorts or casual clothes, the setting is very upscale and you may feel a bit awkward given how dressed up many of the guests (and staff) are. We kind of did any time we went out in jeans.We stayed in a standard room. It was beautiful with high ceilings and gorgeous wall engravings; the bathroom was marble and spacious, including separate tub and big shower. However, the room itself was small and, since the hotel is older, showed wear and tear, which was surprising given that we were paying almost $1,000 American dollars a night to stay there. Also, the TV, which was connected to a computer system, was erratic and very difficult to use. And therein lies our most significant word of caution about Le Meurice: if you're looking for value in terms of the room you're getting, this may not be the place for you. We expected more from the room at that price.The location, right across the street from the Louvre and within walking distance of excellent restaurants and shopping, is very good. However, if you're going to spend a lot of time on the left bank, which we ended up doing, the location isn't as convenient for walking, but it's only a short cab ride away (about 10-15 minutes, depending on traffic).Since we did a lot of sightseeing, we made extensive use of the spa facilities at night. The jacuzzi and steam are fantastic (including marble and a very tranquil setting), and my wife LOVED her spa treatment. The concierge was also always very helpful.All in all, we greatly enjoyed our time at Le Meurice, but would have liked it even more if we got better room facilities for the rate we paid. As a result, we'd recommend reading up on other five star hotels to see how the value you might get there compares to Le Meurice, or whether another location might be more convenient for what you're doing.

<Content>Great hotel with amazing restaurant I recently had a wonderful short stay at the Meurice in Paris. The rooms were well appointed and the staff is superfriendly. Even the taxi driver taking me there from the airport was amazing. He stopped the car to find my small tube of handcream I had dropped between the backseats. Anyhow, back to the Meurice, their restaurant was truly amazing. It must have been one of the more expensive eateries I have been to, but totally worthwhile recommending. Well done, I will come back if I have a chance!

<Content>Treated like royalty (or a rock star) My one night at Le Meurice was the best stay I may have ever had at a hotel. The service was great, the hotel amenities, rooms, and facilities were great, as was the food. When I checked in, I thought I was supposed to have an upgrade, but it wasn't in their system and they didn't think they were going to be able to do anything to fix it. Later in the day, they moved my wife and I to the most amazing room on their Presidential floor. Today, in talking to my travel agent, it turned out that there was a miscommunication and the room I originally received was the right one, so in fact, the hotel didnt make a mistake at all, yet they still moved us. I have had bad hotel experiences in Paris at similarly rated and priced hotels where I felt I was being ripped off- this was certainly not the case at Le Meurice. I look forward to returning for more than 1 night!

<Content>Practically Perfect We also spent a week in a two-bedroom suite at Le Meurice, overlooking the Tuilleries on the Fourth Floor. The suite was elegant and reasonably grand, the fresh flowers kept that way, and the service was absolutely flawless, friendly and better than I have gotten anywhere in the world, except possibly the Ritz (but only 20 years ago, not lately.)We had to see several suites before we got the one we liked, but the staff was unbelievable accomodating, even moving in extra furniture, and rearranging things to suit us. My only complaints: the heated bath tubs make the bathrooms too warm, and the Spa baths and hamman were poorly looked-after -- lots of dirty towels around, no toiletries or shampoo in the showers, the steam room broken and not cleaned for 2 days, etc. The ladies out front were very nice and attractive, but liked to sit chatting rather than actually check on things.We are spolied New Yorkers who have been everywhere, and Le Meurice did not disappoint us -- and I generally don't even like the French! Except for the minor glitches, a garden-view suite at the Le Meurice will do it for me any time I am in Paris. What a swell place to wake up and see the morning light warming the Musee d'Orsay, Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Invalides, Jardins Tuilleries -- and then see it all again as the sun sets and the lights come on.NB - the lobby/bar/restaurant area is a wonderful place to sit and have coffee or even smoke (gasp!) a cigar -- the high ceilings make the smoke disppear, and there is an illusion of sitting in a Belle Epoque outdoor cafe.

<Content>What a hotel! We had the great fortune to spend a week at Le Meurice in Paris with our two children (ages 11 and 12) over Spring Break. I cannot come up with enough accolades to shower upon the staff at Le Meurice. They were extraordinary in every respect. We were in a 2 bedroom suite with balconies that looked out across the Tuileries, with views of the Louvre, Napoleon's Tomb, and the Eiffel Tower. The rooms were exquisite, filled with 3 dozen roses throughout our stay. We started every morning with breakfast in our room, always delicious. Le Meurice is perfectly located, so much so that we walked just down the block to visit the Louvre every day of our stay. The concierge staff was uniformly excellent, arranging lunch and dinner for us every evening. All of their recommendations were superb - our favorite was a simple but scrumptious place called Bistrot St. Honore. So good, in fact, that we went twice! While Le Meurice is clearly one of the finest hotels in all of Paris, they were warm and friendly, not the least bit sniffy to us or our children. I would recommend this hotel without equivocation - it is hard to imagine a stay more wonderful than the one we enjoyed at Le Meurice!

<Content>Great Location, Excellent Service Le Muerice is a classic parisian hotel. The rooms are nice,elegant, and ornate. We stayed in a jr. suite overlooking the courtyard and it was very quiet. I'd have to assume the streetside rooms had better views but were more noisy. The concierge at the hotel were top notch. They really went out of their way to recommend some great restaurants and we were not disappointed. The staff is extremely nice and friendly. Room service as well as any other requests were answered immediately. I personally prefer a more up to date, modern hotel but still enjoyed my stay here. Location was walking distance to Loevre, Notre Dame(15min.), Gucci, Paul Smith, Chanel, Diane Von Furstenberg, Yves, etc.,etc...The only complaint I have would be the pricing of the room service items. I always dislike when people stay at 5 star hotels, then complain about pricing but this deserves a mention. Room Service was so absurdly priced that I don't know how the owners sleep at night. Granted, I ordered anyway b/c I really didn't care but the prices were quite shameful for what you get. Continental Breakfast was $100(dollars not Euros). Coffee, 8 small rolls/pastries, cream and sugar. Come on....Please don't let that discourage you from staying here as it was a great experience. My wife and I went out for breakfast at a new spot within walking distance every day. Drinks and Restaurants at the hotel were priced like every other nice place in Paris...

<Content>Old fashioned legence Think Dorchester, think Le Meurice. This is a classic old fashioned grand hotel. Unlike Grand Dames Hotels in many cities that have faded grandeur, Le Meurice has kept itself up to date whilst retaining its sense of bygone times. The service is excellent, but so it damned well ought to be as anything less would be inexcusable for a hotel such as this. Staying at Le Meurice and complaining about the food bill, is a bit like owning a Bentley and moaning about the service costs. The location is fantastic and it stands to reason that the hotels nearest rivals (Ritz, Georges V etc.) are a stones throw. Rather like London's great five (Dorchester, Connaught, Claridges, Ritz and Berkeley) Le Meurice is one of a handful of top Parisienne hotels that deserves a stay and maybe a few return visits.

<Content>Great hotel Perfect location The Meurice is a beautiful classic parisian hotel. We booked two adjoining rooms. They were huge, (the larger room was about 70sqm) well decorated, well equipped, with view over the Tuileries garden. Service was attentive, breakfast excellent. One bad point: we slept there only one night! We'll definitely go back.

<Content>A wonderul hotel, with wonderful staff My husband and I, along with our 2 daughters, Sophie and Amelia (aged 15 and 11) spent 9 wonderful nights at the Meurice Hotel in Paris in late September. We had travelled from Sydney, Australia. My husband is completely paralysed in a wheelchair (with ALS/Motor Neurone Disease), so we required a specially adapted room with a shower. The rooms at the Meurice were very spacious with enormous marble bathrooms. There was a separate shower and lovely bath, with beautiful toiletries that were replenished twice a day, along with big fluffy towels. Slippers and bathrobes were appreciated, as was the turndown service each evening. The rooms were beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, with a really welcoming ambience. There was a stunning vase of fresh roses in our rooom on arrival. We had 2 rooms - next to each other - so the girls were only steps away. The check-in was extremely efficient, friendly and welcoming. Especially helpful at check-in and throughout our stay was Sophie at the front reception. Nothing was ever too much trouble for Sophie and the other staff. Shortly after we arrived and settled in our room, we were surprised with complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates - and this really set the tone for the remainder of our stay. The rooms also had free ethernet internet connections - a real plus - along with a flat screen cable TV and DVD player. The breakfast room was spectacular - the service was always extremely efficient and friendly, and my husband's needs were always anticipated and met with grace and discretion. We had originally booked another hotel (Les Halles Novotel) from Sydney, but when we arrived at that hotel after travelling for 30 hours from Sydney, we realised we had been very badly mislead about their disabled accessible rooms, despite phoning from Australia 3 times to confirm they had an accessible room with accessible bathroom - as advertsied on their website. Upon seeing the room, we realised it was impossible to stay here: it was impossible for my husband to even get his electric wheelchair into the room or the bathroom. So, fortunately, I had read about the Meurice and we rang them in the hope that they would be able to accommodate us at such short notice. They were - and we are infinitely pleased that our initial bad experience at the Novotel led to us statying at the Meurice. The location is perfect - minutes from eveything we wanted to see. I would love to return there one day and I would unequivocally recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Paris.

<Content>Good; not great I stayed at the Meurice for a night before staying at the Plaza Athene茅 for 3 nights. (not that I did not like it; I just wanted to stay in the Plaza all the long, except that for that one night the prices were sky high because of the fashion show. I had a good corporate rate of 300 Euros, and even then, I found that the Meurice could be better for the amount I paid (can't imagine how much people paid on normal rate). The service was good. It was a very light drizzle and the doormen scrambled and covered us with fancy umbrellas, as well as taking care of the luggage. When we went inside, it wasn't as impressive as I thought though; the lobby could be a little better, it was definitely not wow. Concierge was polite, helpful and good. The rooms were not too bad; okay size but nice big bathrooms. Nice lcd screen too. The beds are nice a soft (may be too soft for some thoguh) and overall speaking, comfortable. The room size could be bigger though, and although the rooms are well decorated, it was not, again, wow. There are different rooms though; (I stayed at a standrad room). Location was not bad unless you're shopping for designer brands, but otherwise, it's a fair walk to attractions and decent shops. Would I stay here again? maybe: if I get a better rate and better rooms. Le Meurice is not bad, but definitely could improve.

<Content>Great Hotel, Wonderful Service, Very High Beverage/Food Prices My daughter and I (she's 23, I'm 51) just returned from a 7-night stay at the Le Meurice Hotel in Paris. I selected this hotel because of it's great location by the Louvre, I wanted excellent concierge service, and wanted to splurge with luxury since this was a trip to celebrate my daughter's graduation from art school. I was very nervous about how we would spend the evenings since my daughter likes to party and I'm a homebody. I enlisted the concierge's help about a month before the trip to plan tours and evening activities. The concierge who assisted me was a young woman, so she was able to relate to my requirement for fun restaurants and evening activities for the two of us. I spoke with the concierge several times before the trip and she emailed and faxed me suggestions and a detailed itinerary. The result included excellent seats to the opera at Opera Bastille, tickets to the ballet at Opera Garnier, a 6-day museum pass, lunch reservations at Jules Vernon in the Eiffle tower, a private tour of the Louvre with an art expert, a small group tour of Giverny and Versailles and dinner reservations for each evening. She also provided us with a map highlighting of the best shopping streets in the various areas that were likely to interest both of us.The hotel itself and facilities were very good. We stayed on a non-smoking floor which had no trace of smoke. All of the fabrics and furnishings were wonderful and make you appreciate the style even if you aren't a Louis XIV style lover. The room was perfect for the two of us. It was great that we each had our own closet and area for drawers. My daughter used the gym everyday and had a massage on one day. She thought those facilities and services were very excellent, though it became obvious that nudity is common in France. I was very pleased with the facilities overall. This is a beautiful hotel.We dined in their more casual restaurant (The Winter Garden) the evening of our arrival, which was perfect after the long travel. The food and service were very good. I debated on selecting our room type whether to include the full American breakfast or not. For that long of a stay I ended up using the lowest room rate for the week days, and used a package for the weekend (which included a full breakfast). If you are going to stay here, I would recommend that you include the full american breakfast. This will be your best price option. The individual breakfast food prices are outrageous. We had an unplanned lunch in The Winter Garden one day. I was surprised that their lunch menu was the same as the dinner menu, though I was appreciative of the ability to only order a main course and have lunch in under one hour. My biggest dissapointment with this hotel was the cost of coffee and a diet coke. It wasn't that I couldn't afford the $9euro diet coke, it just made me angry, as did the $10euro coffee price. I guess this keeps the riff raff from stopping in for a drink. I would definately stay here again. My husband and I stayed at the Plaza Athenee 5 years ago and I like the location of the Le Meurice much better. The service seemed equal. Next time I may try The Crillion, or maybe a small notch downward. I prefer to stay away from stuffy attitudes and judgemental staff. The staff at the LeMeurice generally was very outgoing, service oriented, and tolerant of my daughter's self-expressive California artist appearance.

<Content>Go to the Ritz While the location is unbeatable, the service,rooms and ambiance are lacking at the Meurice. Items were out of order in my room and the floor was under construction. They did however, move me upon request. The clientele is heavily Arabic. For the money you would be better off at the Ritz. I stay in Paris frequently during the year for business as well as pleasure. I live in the States but I am European.

<Content>Wonderful service- excellent location My daughter and I stayed here for seven nights the week of the Tour de France. What can I say the staff was awesome. The rooms were small but very nice and spotless. The food at the resturant was good but not awesome--we had better dining experiences outside of the hotel. The hotel is centrally located and had no trouble accessing the cabs or the trains. All in all a delightful stay.

<Content>Beautiful but disappointing We stayed for a week over New Years. Our first room smelled very bad and an attempt was made to disguise it using plug in air freshner. The second room had a shower that did not drain and needed repair. The waitress in the Jardin D'HIver forgot to serve my glass of wine. Several errors in my bill. The decor is beautiful and I like the location. The conceirge service is excellent. This was my fifth trip to Europe this year and my third to Paris. The standards and attention to detail at this price should be higher.

<Content>Avoid the restaurant "Le Meurice" The Restaurant Le Meurice inside the hotel was a major disapointment. We spent a weekend in Paris to celebrate my birthday, and the highlight was to be a meal at the Restaurant Le Meurice as this was listed as one of the top 25 restaurants in the world in a recent survey. We had eaten at several of the other restaurents included in the list, and had always been very satisfied.It all started well with wonderful decor and champagne to start, but when the food arrived, things started to go wrong.Maybe I picked a poor selection from the menu, but two of my dishes were accompanied by very dull pasta. If it wasn't shop bought dried pasta, it might as well have been. I've had fantastic home made ravioli and other pastas at other restaurents, and couldn't believe how plain and tasteless these side dishes were (one was meant to be served with truffle oil, but I couldn't detect any). My wife ordered a King Prawn dish to start, which she said was cold and raw. She ate less than 1/3. The waiter did ask if there was a problem, but when told what the problem was, replied that it was lightly poached and was meant to be like this.Mains courses were slightly better (at least my wife managed to eat hers), but still unexciting. My jugged hare (Lievre Royale) had a good flavour, but there was too much of one thing. I expect more variety on my plate at a restaurant of this standard.Deserts were the highlight, and were of a standard I would have hoped for throughout the meal.On the way out, the head waiter asked if we had enjoyed the meal, and my wife said that she hadn't enjoyed her first course, but as with the first waiter, he didn't seem to really care. He said something like oh well, what a shame.We had a much better experience the next day, at a third of the price at a restaurant that didn't have a reputation, but seemed to know that good service and good food are more important that gilt and wallpaper.By all means stay at the hotel, but eat somewhere else.

<Content>loved the Meurice Just returned from a stay at the Meurice.I have never been treated so well. We were able to get a upgrade because it was our aniversary. They gave us a room with a balcony overlooking the garden and the Eiffel tower. What a view. They also sent up a bottle of champagne along with some other treats. I would definitely stay here again and the location is great. We walked everywhere. Our package which we obtained from their website included breakfast and the breakfast is served in their two star restaurant so the service was incredible, food was great and we felt like we were having dinner.

<Content>Outstanding experience We had a wonderful experience at this beautiful Paris hotel. Despite the fact that we were travelling with children, the hotel staff welcomed us and did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable. The concierge staff is knowledgeable and helpful. We had one meal in the (ultra expensive) hotel restaurant where the wait staff was superb. They had paper and colored pencils at the ready, as well as custom puzzles of Le Meurice for the children to decipher while we waited for our food. They even offered to take the children to the restroom so that we could remain at the table and enjoy our dinners. When I called the front desk to ask for a converter, it materialized at my room in less than five minutes. Room service was always prompt, and hotel staff friendly. Overall an outstanding experience and well worth the cost.

<Content>Sublime Our three night stay at Meurice Hotel was perfect in every way (except their highly acclaimed restaurant - Le Meurice was closed). We were upgraded from a Jr. Suite to Dlx. Jr. Suite, and ended up with a huge room, which was beautifully appointed. I couldn't fault a thing during our stay from room service to housekeeping. The concierge also took very good care of us and managed to book us into a couple of excellent restaurants for dinner. We had been looking for three days of relaxation and we certainly got it and recommend it highly.

<Content>Exquisite Hotel and Fantastic Service My now-fianc茅 surprised me with a trip to Paris to propose, and we stayed at the Hotel Meurice. The hotel is gorgeous, and the rooms are beautiful!! The bathrooms are all marble and so posh. The new spa is fantastic also. The service was amazing, the best I have ever had. From the surprise bottle of champagne in our room to the reservations for dinner they took care of to their ability to assure we would get into the hottest bars in Paris, they went above and beyond. The breakfast is so elegant - champagne, salmon, cheeses, fruits, etc. Great location too, I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Meurice disappointed We stayed at the Meurice over the New Year. We were disturbed by a noisy neighbour (not a hotel guest) for most of the night of 31 December, although to be fair to the hotel, they did not charge us for that night. It seems unreasonable that the hotel puts guests in accommodation which adjoins non-hotel properties over which the hotel has no control - especially given the rates which Meurice charges.On New Year's Day, there was a queue for breakfast, and we were then served cold coffee and frozen butter. I suspect they were short staffed, and were not using the main hotel dining room which left staff a bit puzzled about where to put people.We decided to check out there and then, 3 days earlier than planned. At 700 Euros a night, this was not what we were expecting.Noise on New Year's Eve is not unexpected, but the staff shortages on New Year's Day are not forgiveable in a first class hotel.

<Content>TOOK OUR BREATH AWAY The Meurice Hotel - my home in Paris from this day forward. I found the hotel on the Trip Advisor site and decided, against a couple of negative opinions listed here, this would be the perfect place for my last night in Paris - also my birthday, and I could not be happier with my decision. Contacting the hotel for my reservation was quick and concise. Upon our arrival, we were told they apologized but our room would be another 20 minutes. The hotel manager escorted us personally to their lovely lounge where we had complimentary beverages and delicious little snacks. Almost as soon as we got our glasses of wine, someone came to tell us the room was ready. Soon we found out why the delay - because of my birthday the hotel had decided to offer us a complimentary upgrade to a stunning suite on the 5th floor. We went to the room and found a birthday cake, champagne, petit fours and a lovely silver encased candle in a room built for a queen! They had needed the extra time to offer me these thoughtful gifts, complete with a birthday card from the hotel. The view from the three - yes - three balconies made me want to stay forever - from the Louvre to the Eiffel Tower - never had I seen a more breathtaking sight! The concierge set up my birthday dinner reservations and the restaurant even gave me a gift! NO detail was forgotten. Oops - did I mention the beautiful fresh flowers all over the suite? Morning came too early, but our grand room service breakfast made it a little easier to take. If you cannot appreciate this amazing hotel, you do not know fine service and stunning facilities. My thanks to all the Meurice staff and I will come back - again and again and again.

<Content>Puzzled I simply cannot understand how anyone could not apprieciate the very attentive service, wonderful decor and superb location of the Meurice. It is truely fabulous and even managed to impress Queen Victoria. The only problem I have with it is I have to bi-pass the Plaza Atenee to stay here. Granted I stayed here in October 2004 but I doubt much will have changed in one month, it is truely an extrodinary place to stay and beats the wooden, unfriendly George V without trying. The Dorchester group will always be the exception and the Four Seasons, the dissapointing competition as far as I am concerned.

<Content>Excellent Response to Questions While a change of plans has prompted us to postpone our visit to the Meurice, I did write to Christine Odile regarding the negative reviews posted on the Trip Advisor website. Ms. Odile responded immediately to my questions addressing each of the comments made in the reviews with assurances that all matters were thoroughly investigated and addressed. She also noted that our reservation was incorrectly booked through AMEX and made sure that when we do book next time she would handle our reservation personally. I have written to hotel managements and travel providers in the past and received either no response or a form letter acknowledgement. Ms. Odile's personal response to my e-mail was unexpected and welcomed, and her offer of on-going assistance was out of the ordinary. Hotels no matter how many stars, like guests, are not always perfect. In this case, I think Ms. Odile behaved professionally and courteously and if she continues to insist on her brand of five star service, I trust the Hotel Meurice will live up to its five star rating, too!

<Content>Very disappointing We stayed at the Meurice for 3 nights in September 2004 and we were very disappointed.We had been trying for several months prior to arrival to confirm a garden view room. At check in, we again asked for a room with a nice view, but were told they only had a room facing the court yard. Once in our room, we were shocked to see that our room was not a court yard view, but a inside roof view. If you stuck your head out the window and looked up, you could barely view the sky. Not only no view, but the bathtub in our large bathroom did not work. The hair dryer was heavy, attached to the wall and required you to continue to hold down the on switch to keep it working. As for service, it was luke warm. When I called housekeeping to request a new hair dryer, no one answered. When I tried the front desk, I was told to try housekeeping again. I expected better service for a 5 star hotel. Also, the area around the Hotel Meurice has become a little questionable. We were concerned about our safety at night. Although similar in price, the Meurice did not compare to the George V where we stayed for the first 4 nights of our Paris stay.
