<Content>Internet Very Expensive read this to save a few bob Stayed here in January for 2 nights.The room we were assigned had a terrible bed. We had just flown from Hong Kong so we left it until the morning and they gave us an alternative room without question. Staff were fine. Hotel is clean and comfortable. And is ideally located right outside central station. The trip from the airport on the train was 10 mins max. We got breakfast included in the deal and the self service buffet was excellent. Their broadband rates are crazy. $10 for an hour $22 for a day. There is a bar at the entrance to central station (right outside the hotel) and I went there, had a few drinks and surfed for nothing on a free uconnect wi-fi zone. Pool is small and was full of roaring kids when we went up. No supervision either. Gym is small with about 4-5 machines. It wasn't busy though. goof few channels on the TV and the room had a fridge. Concierge is very good and a good man to ask advice from about Sydney.

<Content>Beautiful room  We (two adults) got a great rate booking directly on the Mercure website (early bird Summer special) of $AUD89. We only needed one night in Sydney following a cruise before our flight home the next day and thought this looked reasonable. We were totally blown away when we saw the room. After reading reviews we expected a standard, one room twin room with ensuite however the room had a huge (super king?) bed and in a separate divided area, a pull out sofa couch which was very comfortable to sleep on. The linens were lovely and soft and the towels were huge. There was an enormous HD flatscreen TV, small kitchenette (fridge/microwave) and a dining room table. The bathroom was a little small but we weren't planning on spending quality time in there. The room was very quiet - we didn't hear anyone in the next rooms, corridor and no traffic noise. The indoor pool looked nice but there were some children splashing about in it so we didn't go in. The location was excellent, right near Central Station and a short walk to Paddy's Market Mall and China Town. Easy access to trains, buses and the free CBD Shuttle. The checkin was easy, our room wasn't ready when we checked in (9am) but concierge took our suitcases and delivered them to the room when it was ready. We just went back later in the day to get our room number and keys. Both the checkin staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful. We got concierge to arrange us a shuttle to the airport for $AUD12 each which was even cheaper than the train and only took about 15 minutes to get from reception to the airport - we were the last stop so were at the airport without delay. I'd definitely stay there again!

<Content>Good Hotel, Comfortable rooms. Easy location Stayed for 2 nights while in Sydney. Got fed up of Hostels so booked in as it was close to central station and easy to get to everywhere in sydney from here. Check in was fine, pleasant girl. Didnt offer too much information, i had to ask for info, but apart from that no problems. Had a room on the 14th Floor (top floor) with city views. There is an indoor pool and gym and sauna on the 15th floor, up one flight of stairs. Room itself was very comfortable. Large King size Bed, Big TV, plenty space to put stuff. Bathroom nice with good toiletries would definitely stay again if in the area

<Content>Average No offer of help with luggage.When asked for help with directions, had a map thrust at us over the counter and walk to the left to get to The Rocks.Good check-inEasy check-outDuring the night there was a thumping sound coming from the wall next to the bed head. Called reception, to enquire if it was the room next door or an air con unit or such, they offered to do a floor walk and couldn't hear anything. Of course not, it was not thumping in the hallway, but in the wall. No offer of a room move.Nice view from pool, although no spa and the sauna was broken when we stayed, the staff were aware when we called to ask for assistance, just said oh yeah, its broken, guess the sign was taken away.Otherwise, nicely situated near train station and close walk to city.

<Content>Exactly what we wanted-and exceptional service We were meeting up with my mother and two teenagers for two nights in Sydney so had booked two rooms at the Mercure Central (as they were coming by train) and one room required a rollaway bed. To make matters more complicated for reception we were delayed and they had to check in first but I had made the booking with an Accor Advantage card. This was handled easily and the staff even offered to set-up the rollaway later so as to leave more space. We stayed in quite a few hotels lately but the staff here really impressed. Was their 10th anniversary and the opening night of the Olympics so they were handing out fortune cookies with free and discounted drinks as the message. Saving around $20 in the bar certainly got the stay off to a good start. Rooms had a 'funky' feel to them with vibrant colours. Lovely big TVs. Bar was really cosy and the free drinks helped. Breakfast was the real treat with the sort of dishes and little touches that you would only see at a 5 star establishment (individual poached eggs, breakfast sundaes etc). Seemed to be a few airline crew using the hotel including pilots which is a good sign. Negatives: quite a few Asian and American tour groups but they didn't impact too much on us, there was a mild 'backed-up' smell from the toilet on both days we stayed but I doubt that they can do much about that. Internet access for 24 hours wasn't cheap ($25) but they may have forgotten to charge for it. Parking garage was easy to find and the fee was around $30 which is pretty average for Sydney. Overall we loved our stay here primarily due to the 'can do't attitude of all staff that we met. Would definitely stay here again as the price is right.

<Content>Loved the Mercure - Have stayed before and will stay again Have stayed at the Mercure during my previous visits to Sydney and it has never let me down. Location is excellent, adjacent to public transport and great food in nearby Chinatown.Staff friendly as always and beds are comfy. Great water pressure in the showers.Swimming pool (indoor) can get a little cool in during the winter months. Great gym facilities.100% recommend!

<Content>Just OK great value for money as we've made the booking 2 or 3mos early** good points:-very friendly staff esp those at reception/concierge-easy access to public transport-fastfoods within the vicinity** not so good:-does the hotel have any bellboys? - as we didnt see one (we stayed for 4days), or maybe we may not have noticed it all as nobody offerred to help/assist us with our luggages/bags- airconditining/ temperature in the room becomes warm at night time

<Content>Very accommodating! My husband and I recently spent our anniversary trip in Australia. During that time, we stayed in 5 different hotels, and the Mercure Sydney was the only hotel out of them to offer us a complimentary upgrade. They also sent up a bottle of champagne after we checked in upon finding out it was our anniversary. The accommodations and location were great. We were able to walk to Darling Harbour  Chinatown within 10 minutes. The only downside was the lobby; it had a horrible smell that made us rush through to the elevators as fast as we could. Other than that, it was great.

<Content>Cushions galore! Cushions galore on the comfy bed, excellent concierge service and good location on George St to explore Sydney. Could have slept in the comfy bed all weekend! Staff fine but not in your face friendly! Clean, plenty room for baggage in the room and stunning views! No hesitation and would stay again on a return visit! Note, side entrance of hotel lobby for taxis!

<Content>Functional hotel Stayed here with my wife  teenage son for best part of a week mid/late March. Much like in the vicinity of many large railway stations throughout the world the area is a bit shabby, at the 'wrong' end of George St in the CBD. However, its proximity to Central Station means excellent transport links to virtually everwhere in Sydney, its suburbs  NSW.Right next to Chinatown for plenty of good, cheap meals, also about 5 mins walk from Darling Harbour and 15/20 mins from Circular Quay on foot.Hotel itself is pretty functional  good value for the centre of town if pretty much all you need is a clean, convenient place to get your head down after a hard day embracing the delights of Sydney.As mentioned, concierege very good. Also Europcar office located in lobby for easy car hire.Restaurants ok, if pricey  a bit lacking in character. Swimming pool small but ok.

<Content>Not a too bad! I'd stay again. I am a frequent travler for both business and pleasure and I've stayed in the Sydney CBD several times. Overall, the Mercure was a pretty decent experience considering my stays in the Sydney CBD hotels in this price and 3-4 star range. I paid $170/night for a double room, which is not bad for this area of Sydney. I am an American who now lives permantly in Australia and I have to say that from an American perspective Australian hotels are generally more expensive and smaller than most U.S. hotels. Mercure hotels are similar in quality to Holiday Inn Express's in my opinion. Due to concerns about street noise (yes I'm high maintenance because I'm a light sleeper) I had requested a room on an upper floor and was disappointed when I checked in and I was put on the 4th floor. However, the room was quiet and clean (and I am VERY picky when it comes to cleanliness). The amenities in this hotel are very basic, but high speed Internet access in the rooms, comfortable bed, cable TV, good hair dryer and iron/ironing board, small refrigerator, writing table and the shower is good etc. It is clean and comfortable and the staff are generally friendly and helpful. The location is great as it is right by the train station and very close to UTS, Paddy's Markets, Haymarket, Chinatown etc. There are TONS of great China town restraunts nearby and it is only a few blocks to great shopping. You can comfortably walk to lots of attractions from here. To summarize, if you're looking for a luxury accomodation this is definitely not it, but if you're looking for a comfortable, conveniently located and clean hotel then the Mercure Sydney will meet your needs.

<Content>Give it a try! I stayed for two nights at the Mercure Sydney in October, and was impressed with the room. We arrived very early in the morning (overnight flight from the U.S.), and our room was already ready. I had requested an early check-in when booking, but that's never a guarantee. The concierge staff was extremely helpful with booking our Bridge Climb, as well as offering great local restaurant/area suggestions. The room was clean, and a very nice size for two people. And, the location of the hotel was great for catching a bus, walking to sights and getting to/from the airport.

<Content>Standard and clean This hotel does not exceed expectations or provide anything above the ordinary, which is not to say that it is bad. The staff are friendly and helpful (especially the concierge) and the facilities are adequate. The area where it is located is shabby and dirty. However, if you want transport links, it has them in abundance! Notwithstanding, I had the unfortunate experience of using public transport from outside the hotel door early on a Sunday morning with the remnants from the night before still evident on the street, benches, etc (you get the picture). As they say over here, you don't get 'bang for your buck' - you get what you expected and nothing more: a clean, business-orientated hotel with a distinct lack of trimmings.

<Content>Corporate decor circa 1995 This is a fairly clean hotel, in a slightly-above-ok area. The decor hasn't been updated since the early- or mid-90s. The reception and concierge are friendly and helpful. It's ok for the price but would probably try to find something a little nicer even if it costs a bit more.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! Will stay again! I have just returned from a lovely stay at the Mercure Sydney and would certainly recommend it! My partner and I stayed at the there over the weekend following a business conference on Friday. The hotel staff were fantastic and during check-in on Friday morning i mentioned we had a late flight out of Sydney on Sunday night and they immediately offered a free late check-out! We were given a room on the 5th floor which had a double bed and very large LCD TV. Also had small bathroom with shower/bath and basic hygiene products (soap/body-wash/ shampoo/conditioner etc).As I was running late for a business meeting the concierge had a cab waiting downstairs for us after we dropped off our bags. Upon returning to the hotel that evening we decided to inquire about upgrading our room for the weekend as we rarely get away and wanted to make the most of it. The staff were really helpful and offered us an upgrade to a balcony room with city view on the 12th floor for only $40 a night! Gus the concierge was very helpful as we went to collect our bags from our first room and move to our new room. The new room was slightly larger, had a queen sized bed, more cupboard space and fridge with kettle and basic tea/coffee supplies. The balcony was a decent size and the view was much nicer than the wall we had been previously facing. Bathroom and TV were the same. Both rooms however were really clean, comfy and had lovely soft sheets and pillows.We really enjoyed getting breakfast delivered to our room each morning. We would just fill in the card at night saying what we wanted and the next morning at the specified time they would bring you a lovely tray with hot cooked breakfast. Prices were really reasonable (about $10 each), however i can't say the same for the rest of the room service menu which was very over-priced. You didn't need to go far to get great food though. Chinatown is on the doorstep, Darling Harbour is a 5 min walk away and Central station is also right outside so the location is really fantastic!Overall a lovely stay and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a lovely place to stay on a budget.

The company had spent a considerable amount of money at the hotel so was disappointed to be placed in a cruddy room. Complained of smell  plumbing overflowing into basin. Was relocated to another room not much better. Chipped tiles, plumbing problems - should be rated 3 stars not 4.

<Content>Basic but great value Stayed here numerous times and the last time was back in mid-2003. It is a very basic sort of hotel that's efficiently run and managed. The rooms are pretty small, somewhat gritty due to the high turn over, but usually the price is really good so you can score a great deal.It seems that a lot of airlines use this hotel for their aircrew as I've always seem plenty of flight attendants waiting in the lobby (it's pretty close to the airport actually, but still in a good spot in the city).Although the location is perfect for public transportation (train is a 5-10minute walk underground and buses are all around) and only a 5 minute walk to Chinatown/Darling Harbour, you'll be better off staying further in midtown Sydney (perhaps at Avillon, World Square, or places nearby. Hilton is too expensive, but very, very luxurious and great location).Overall, I would recommend this place as a nice, but relatively cheap place to stay. Not sure what it's like now though on the inside...

<Content>Not the greatest hotel you'll stay at I stayed at the Mercure for 3 nights earlier this month and found it to be an ok experience but i think i'd look elsewhere before going back.The hotel was clean, staff were friendly and the room was spacious. No complaints so far. However, my room was situated on the third floor and it was incredibly noisy at night and it proved to be difficult to get a good nights sleep. Although you don't need to break the bank to stay at the Mercure for the price you pay you'd certainly expect the rooms to be soundproofed better and i'd suggest looking at other hotels in the area before booking here.

<Content>Great Hotel in suitable location Stayed in Sydney for a mid week 2 night getaway, and was thrilled with acoommodation at the Mercure Sydney. Location was perfect for a couple with only a map and no car- Circular Quay and the harbour bridge / opera house etc is a scenic hours walk fone George Street, monorail is 5 minutes away which can take you to Darling Harbour and the aqurium etc. Bus stop is right out the front, lots of taxis. Conceirge desk well manned and very helpful. Quick check in, smart mini bars located on each floor, table and couches on each floor. Room is nice with big TV, big bed and nice bathroom. Absence of lots of facilities in the room seemed to be the only downside (little hygein kit in bathroom etc). Nice pool on level 15, next to gym. Breakfasts are good, restaurant and bar always full. Another independently owned bar with pokies in on ground floor. Very proefssionally run hotel, will return.

<Content>One of the Best Hotels I've Ever Stayed at The Sydney Mercure Hotel is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. I visited as a single traveller, and I was actually given a really good room. It was far from the elevator (so it was quiet), was one of the largest rooms on the floor (based on the floorplan), and overlooked George Street. The room was extremely clean and the housekeepers very friendly. The concierge was super helpful and friendly, and delivered the newspaper to me daily for free. The location of the hotel is great, as it is located on George Street, one of the main streets in Sydney, and is right across the street from the Central Railway station, making rail transporation really convenient. The hotel is within walking distance to Chinatown, Haymarket, Darling Harbour, Glebe, and the central shopping area i.e. Pitt Street Mall. And since I shopped a lot, it was easy to hop on a train back to central station rather than walk with all my bags. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>decent hotel good location Stayed at the Sydney Mercure over 26-29 November 2006 with no problems whatsoever. If you have limited time in Sydney you would probably enjoy being closer to the harbour, but this is a good location for getting around the city as it's quite close to the central station. There was a queue for checkin but this went quite fast. Staff were great and outwardly friendly to guests. Breakfast was a bit too chaotic and overpriced for me, but there are plenty of alternatives nearby. Hotel is close to transport and also there is a 24 hour shop next door...very convenient for travelers.

<Content>Mecure for me! We stayed at the Mecure en route to Hawaii from West Australia. The facilities are excellent it is perfect location from which to traverse the city if you don't have a car. ( Incidently if our experiences are any guide, in travelling by taxi and tour bus, Sydney is a good place not to have a car, as we were gridlocked twice in two days.)The train station and bus stops are on the doorstep and so everywhere in the city is easily assessible from the hotel. Rooms are great 鈥撯€揳s are the beds. Big thumbs up !

<Content>Great value for money My husband and I stayed here for a night. Room was clean and of good size. Location was fantastic. Booking thro the hotel website was quite painless and we got a good rate too. as we were leaving early the next day, we did not take the breakfast, They helped us with making arrangement for the airport transfer the folloing day so that was useful too. Asked for extra pillows though and was a little surprised that it was given without cases on them? And i found all the reviews on this site very useful to help us decide on the hotel too. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for centrally located accommodation in syndey at a reasonable price. Check in and checkout was quick and painless. they even let us check in early without any hassles

<Content>A Great stay at Mercure We loved the Mercure. Within walking distance from Central Train station, surrounded by variously priced cafes, restaurants and shops. Its a perfect location to visit any of the Sydney sites. We arrived very early in the morning, checked our bags and did some touring. When we came back at 11 the room was ready. We really needed the rest after an all night flight from Malaysia. The Hotel and room was in excellent shape, clean, quiet and comfortable. Bathroom was large and intelligently designed. We got very good service with our requests for a baby cot and a power adapter. All the staff was professional and friendly. Lots of TV shows to entertain our 3 year old. Our only complaint was the room was a bit narrow for the 4 of us. We did not eat there, but the hotel pub had a decent happy hour. Overall I cannot find fault with the Mercure.

<Content>Just not right Not enough staff on front desk. Very busy check-in. Room key (card) didn't work. Back to the queue. New room key didn't work. Back to the queue. Promised that when we returned (from a walk) it will work. It didn't. Asked to be moved to another room - 'no' as hotel was full. Rang some friends and decided to stay at their place.....so requested we check out at no charge.....surprise surpirse, a room was available (which had a working key card). So we were lied to.Double beds are smaller than the average double bed.....looked like a king single.Just a big let down.

<Content>Good location This was our second stay in this hotel having been here in 2000. We arrived early but couldn't check into our room. It was ready but they said it needed to be checked by the supervisor. This seeemed to take about 2 hours to accomplish. We were offered a coffee in the lounge while we waited and the waiter took about 20 minutes to bring our coffee even though we were the only ones in the lounge and he was behind the bar the whole time. Other than that, our stay was very pleasant. Our room was good and we found the city's transportation system to be excellent as usual.

<Content>Good location Circular Quay  Darling Harbour are both walkable from the hotel but are a fair distance. However, the Mercure is just a few steps from the railway station  bus stops, so getting around is no problem at all.Both times I stayed at this hotel, I arrived at about 7am which was of course way before the standard time for check in. However, the reception staff were most helpful in finding me an available room both times.The food  drink are both reasonably priced and of a good standard.The rooms are a good size  well equipped.It will always be my first choice in Syndey

<Content>High quality, value for money city hotel We stayed here over New Year, their busiest period, with no problems at all. The room and hotel was nicely decorated in a modern style, the staff were friendly and helpful, breakfast was huge and great (though not included in the room rate, it was $15 each) and it was in good location. It is above average for a large city hotel.

<Content>Nice Location, Great Concierge, Value for money Hi,We stayed for 3 days at Mercure in November 06. We had requested an early checkin around 9AM and a room on the upper floors and when we arrived, we got what we wanted. Check in was a breeze. Hotel room was clean and tidy. The location of hotel was ideal for us as we had a car. 10 mins to Circular Quay. There is a coffee and sandwich shop just outside the hotel, plus a small convenience store just outside the hotel for odds and ends. There is a Thai restaurant attacted to the hotel which was convenient for us. The concierge in the lobby was excellent and really helped us out if we needed directions or restaurants. If we wanted to eat Lebanese they would pick the restaurants for us with the directions. If we wanted to have drinks, they not only told us the place but called the place to find out the prices. So, I had no complaints as far as the hotel staff was concerned.Parking was extra A$20 per day which was painful, but other than that i would highly recommend the hotel and stay here again.

<Content>Functional and good value Stayed in Mercure, George Street, Sydney for 5 days this October and used as a base for exploring the city.Hotel is located at the far end of George Street, right next to the train station and very close to China Town. Not a bad location if you're in Sydney for a few days, as wherever you stay will require a walk. However, Darling Harbour, the Rocks etc is a good 30 minute hike - although it's a good (and safe) route as plenty of interest on the way.Hotel itself is pretty large, with a ok size pool and a teeny gym (5 or so cardio machines and a weights station). Pleasantly surprised at the room - very good size, nicely decorated and good facilities - suspect it has been recently refurbished. Huge, huge bed and enough pillows to temporarily lose the person lying next to you. Staff polite and courteous, but hardly personalised attention, but we had no real problems or queries so didn't need much attention. Reception is always really busy - no matter what time of day or night!Tip - use their hotel shuttle if travelling to and from the airport, it actually works out cheaper and quicker than catching the train. Also, the hotel restaurant is much better than we expected - used once out of necessity - great food and varied menu.All in all, if you get a good deal, go for it, but don't waste any extra pennies expecting something out of the ordinary.

<Content>Great location, great hotel I stayed at the Mecure for two nights whilst in Sydney for business. My room was very clean and beautifully appointed - I think it had been recently refurbished. The concierge staff were lovely and very helpful; and both check-in and check-out were quick and painless. Breakfast was fantastic, although the rock melon looked pretty manky. My bathroom had a revolting smell in it, which I think was from the water, not sure if it could be altered. China Town and Darling Harbour in easy walking distance.

<Content>No problems I stayed here overnight last week.Overall, I really enjoyed my stay, and wanted to stay for longer. The location was brilliant (just a subway walk away from central station, within walking distance of Darling Harbour, and basically on top of a major bus interchange) and the facilities were awesome (indoor pool and gym had amazing views). Although I only had a standard room, I was fortunate enough to be on the top floor, which had great views over to Sydney airport, and of the inner western sydney suburbs.My room was great, very clean and stylish. Perhaps the interior of the motel is slightly more dated than the exterior, but the rooms are still fresh and modern. Only complaint was that I didn't have a microwave, but had everything else I needed!Reception was extremely busy, with long queues to check in (at 5pm) and check out (at 8am). Visitors are treated like they are in cattle class, but that is to be expected in motel if this size. Staff were still friendly and accomodating, despite having to deal with huge volumes of people. Nice resturants and outdoor eating areas surround the reception area, as well as a very handy convenience store.I'm looking forward to staying at this place again in the near future!

<Content>Avoid From the country  booked for a four-day family Easter break to visit the Royal Easter Show  sightsee..most disappointing. The hotel was packed to full capacity. Our room was small  dirty  needed a coat of paint and a good scrub. Bed bugs, cold showers every morning, 2 wall containers of shower gel but no soap or shampoo, complimentary breakfast ran out of seating  food each morning etc. Had stayed here previously  enjoyed it,  as repeat customers we thought our patronage would be rewarded. But never again. Camping is preferable to what we endured (and cheaper)! This is the first hotel where we encountered bed bugs,  yet have travelled extensively both in Australia and overseas. Complained on leaving to management but no empathy - busy Easter period no excuse.

<Content>Good hotel in Sydney I have just spent 2 nights in Sydney Mercure on business and although it is a good 15 minute walk to the centre of Sydney I have to say that the staff and accommodation surely makes up for this.I was greeted with a most affable check in gentleman who was most obliging and genuinely interested in helping me determine how long it would take to walk to my business appointment the next day. The smiles, sense of humour and thoroughness was very much appreciated by a weary traveller.The room was excellent with good city views and althought the hotel is on major roads into Sydney the noise was no worse than other big cities. Room was in a vey good condition, bathroom very clean, lots of towels, bath(shower over bath) and hot water and the bed was excellent!!! Fridge in room as well as small safe.Ate in the restaurant in the hotel and found staff were attentive (without being over the top) and the Atlantic Salmon was most delicious and serving size was excellent.I would recommend this hotel as I have stayed in a few in Sydney and found this to be well above the average. Rooms are not enormous but adequate. Well done to the staff! and the chef!!!!

<Content>Great Location, Very Clean, We just returned from 2 weeks in Australia, we stayed at the Mercure for 2 nights on April 16th and 17th. The rooms were very clean, and the location was great. We were able to walk up George Street to Darling Harbour quickly. The cost for breakfast was somewhat high, but there is a McDonalds across the street.

<Content>Good Solid Choice, Handly Location I enjoyed my 7 nights at the Mercure Sydney. The location by the Central Railway Station is handy if you take the rail link from the airport, and also if you plan to explore Sydney's beaches by public transport. It is at the opposite end of the CBD from Circular Quay so be prepared for a long walk if you wish to go there, or to take the subway. Chinatown, Darling Harbour and the Powerhouse Museum are all an easy walk.Check in was efficient. I was early so my room wasn't ready but a place to chnage was offered and bag storage. My room was on the 13th floor, facing Little Regent Street this may have made it quieter than rooms on the other side facing the bus stops. be aware though that there is a building directly facing it on Little Regent, which would look directly into rooms, probably below the 10-11 floor. My only complaint was the amount of skuff marks along one wall, otherwise the room was compact but nicely furnished. A ironing board with iron, tea kettle, and coffee and tea, hair dryer and bar fridge were all provided. There's no mini-bar but a Smartbar on each floor contains beer, sprits,and snacks A special card is needed from front desk.In short, I would stay again and recommend for someone looking for a reasonably priced hotel in Sydney.

<Content>Great Hotel and Great Location This hotel is in a wonderful location for those who want to explore Sydney. It's virtually beside Central Station (also where the airport link starts) and close to Oxford Street, Hyde Park, Museums, shopping, Kings Cross and lots more.Our room was clean, spacious with a huge king size bed. The bathroom was pretty spacious and had an excellent shower head (rare in hotels I've found). Has cable TV, a pool and gym.The buffet breakfast is excellent, lots of variety, a proper coffee machine where you can make your own espresso, juice, hot food like bacon, eggs, sausages and pancakes as well as fruit, cereal, pastries etc. We paid $160 including breakfast for two and overnight carparking. For central Sydney, I think this is pretty good.
