<Content>Not So 5 Star As Claimed We got to the hotel with the idea that it is actually in Nusa Dua. Rightfully, it is not in Nusa Dua but the 'extension' of it called Tanjong Benoa. Tg Benoa is more like a haven for beach sports where the day on the beach is filled with crowd eagerly waiting to ride the 'flying fish', do parasailing, take a boat out for snorkelling and etc. These are tourists all over Bali sent by bus loads for the beach activities.Totally, unlike Nusa Dua beach (which is quiet and peaceful where you can have a good time basking at the sun decks with a good book). Ramada is just an average hotel because it is now old and a little run down. Believe it was a beautiful one back 10-15 years ago. Though it was still well maintained, the tiles, flooring, setting and etc are old.Rooms are clean and reasonably comfortable but the toilet/bathroom is old looking, including old tiles, faucets, layout and towels. Gym facilities are old too... Service is so-so as well compared to other 5 star in Nusa Dua.Ramada does not have a direct beach so you have got to cross the road to get to the beach, which is a public beach where as said, all beach activities thrive. Ramada has however a squared off a decent area where only hotel guests are allowed with a simple swimming pool attached and a Thai restaurant to feed the hungry stomach.

<Content>Beach is not good To me a Bali vacation must have a nice beach where you can relax and swim. This one does not have it. 1st, there is no direct beach access, it's across the street. 2nd, the beach area is small and not private, many boats around. Finally and worst, you cannot swim at all. The water was not clear due to too many boats around. I switched to another hotel the next day. Last note, the swimming pool is very small, like a home pool.

<Content>9 days in Bali I booked this hotel for a 9 day vacation for my family of five plus my mother. Choose the hotel for the rate (US$95) as we needed two rooms. Plus I thought the hotel would have a nice beach access. The hotel is a little bit older, but has a great Bali feel with the faux monuments, fish ponds, lush gardens  Bali architecture. My three kids (6, 3, 1.5 yrs) loved the two pools, fish ponds,  gardens. The breakfast  room service was good. Kids enjoyed feeding the fish every morning after breakfast with the bread provided by the staff. We only ate dinner at the hotel one night, but it a very nice Indonesia buffet with a show. Only complaint I had at the hotel was the mold in the shower could have been cleaned out better. Also, beware the beach at the hotel is not a swimming beach due to the amount of boats  water sports. No problem with the beach though, the hotel has a free shuttle to Gerger beach ~ 30 minutes twice a day. Gerger beach is a great family beach, no waves, great swimming, full facilities for food, bathrooms, etc.Also you can hire a driver, Mardy, for the day cheaper than upgrading to a hotel on the beach. We ended up hiring a driver for the week. Use him or his team almost every day, heading out to all of the great locations  beaches around Bali. If you are going to Bali  need a great tour guide I highly recommend him, mardana45@hotmail.com In the end, I was only charged US$90/night for the first week  then US$95 for the last couple days, which I did not complain about! We had a great trip  if we went back I'd stay there again  hire Mardy again.

<Content>A good value hotel. My girlfriend and I booked this hotel because we had read the reviews on this site, and it was only going for about $60 for the poolside room. My first impression was that this hotel is a little old. Check in was smooth, and the bellboy brought our luggages to the elevator. He pressed the down button on the elevator which I thought was strange, but then took us up to the third floor. I later found out that the up button didn't work, but thats no big problem.. all you have to do is just press the down button and select your floor. At any rate, the rooms were decent. The size was a bit bigger than an average hotel room, and it was clean.We were starving when we arrived so we ordered some room service, and the room service is decent priced. We got some spaghetti for less than $10, and it was really good spaghetti I gotta say.Although most people are not gonna care, I at least loved the submerged pool bar. You can order a cocktail and get a carved out fruit with the drink inside the fruit and sit inside the pool while you drink it. I thought that was great, and found that this definitely beats having to get out of the pool to get a drink at a table (but thats just me). The pool usually has very few people in it, so even though it's small, its adequate.The breakfast buffet is not the best food. Its a bit worse than average for hotel food.The hotel is quite big so to walk from one end to the other can be a few minutes, but we found that you can just cut through the middle through the pool area, and get to your room quicker rather than walking all the way around the hotel past every hotel room.All in all, I'd recommend this hotel if you didn't want to spend so much money, but didn't want to be in a tacky hotel. If you're looking for an AMAZING hotel, this place isn't for you, but if you're looking for the bang for the buck... I'd definitely recommend this place.

<Content>Case Study in Poor Customer Service My husband and I recently stayed at the Ramada during a trip to Bali to celebrate our anniversary. I had read Trip Advisor and was a bit wary of the negative comments for the hotel, but decided to give this hotel a try considering its reasonable rates. (Our stay was planned for the end of a long trip in which we were staying at other hotels ranging from $225 to $250 a night, vs. $90 a night at the Ramada.)Overall, the hotel is better than the Ramadas in the US - the rooms while not luxurious are comfortable. We had already been to the gorgeous beaches of Canggu, Seminyak, Jimbaran, and Nusa Lemongan, so we did not mind that the beach attached to the Ramada isn't the nicest (per the other reviewers, it is indeed mired with boats and jet skiis, and during low tide, is covered in seaweed rather than clean sand). The Tao restaurant has a nice pool and the food was reasonably priced as well (~$50 per meal for 2 people with drinks). However, the experience breaks down when customer service is involved. First of all, I had booked our room online, and when I tried to email the hotel at the email listed on their web site to confirm our reservation and to find out about when their late check out is, no one answered. I had emailed 6 times, and no answer. In fact, I had to get the concierge at another (far better) hotel in Bali to confirm my reservation with the Ramada. Then there was the fact that the Ramada would not help me book alternative transportation to the airport. They charge $15 per trip using their hotel shuttle, when a taxi should cost only $7. When I asked them to book a car with a private driver we had found, they charged me $2 just to make the call. I was really appalled that they would be so cheap considering we had not made any other customer service request of them. Booking a car for the airport should be the least that they could do for their customers.Finally, there was a bill dispute that they failed miserably at handling (they charged us a full third day's rate when they should have only charged us for a late check out on the third day). The manager was completely unwilling to budge on this, giving absolutely no concessions or even a discount considering it was fully the hotel's mistake. My husband and I discussed this and realized it was probably a directive from Ramada's central management not to let junior managers do what they need to to help their customers and ensure complete satisfaction. The difference between a full day and a half day's rate was only $45, but because they were unwilling to even consider this, they have lost us as customers for life. I am planning to write a strongly worded letter to Ramada central management about this issue, and would definitely never recommend Ramada to any of my friends and associates. My husband is planning to use our experience at the Ramada in his company presentation of how NOT to manage customer service, and I am planning to submit this case to my business school as well as a case study in poor customer service management.In short - if you wish to truly experience the luxury, comfort, and amazing customer service that Bali has to offer, pay a little more and stay at the myriad other hotels in South Bali - not the Ramada.

<Content>Ripped off and Mislead on Upgrade - Food Poisoning Beware Overall a nice hotel if you discount the food poisoning we got on the first day - 3 of us ate only hotel food and we all suffered from Diarrhea and stomach cramps for the first 3 days of our holiday.Also beware that whilst the resort is nice the beach across the road (Nusa Dua) is a dump. If you want to go on banana boats all day and don't mind being hassled all the time then you might like it...If you want to swim in polluted water with hundreds of jet skis and speed boats or stay in the resort (assuming you have a cast iron stomache) all the time then consider this as an option otherwise go to Kuta, Seminyak or any of the hundreds of other nice beaches in BaliThe hotel was overbooked when we arrived and as a nice touch they upgraded our room to a villa - not exactly a villa but a sort of one room apartment - the first night was free since this was there mistake but in broken English we were told that we could stay in the villa for an extra $70 which sounded very reasonable and we were happy not to have to move again after the tiring journey...Half way through the stay we decided to check how much room service and drinks were because we didn't want a horrible shock at the end - we then found out that the upgrade was $70 dollars a night despite what we had been told on check in... ahhh!!Needless to say we moved back with some difficulty to the standard room that was actually more comfortable and at first we told they were doing us a big favour in allowing us to do this...As I have seen from other reviews its all fine until you have a problem and then they won't budge - overall their poor attitude at rectifying problems caused is saddening and frustrating and leaves a very sour taste in your mouth...We spoke with the management many times and they eventually offered us a 20% discount on the upgrade costs - this was a small consolation really since we were in a family group with 3 rooms and spent a huge amount on drinks etc. Infact the discount offered didn't even cover the cost of the food that upset our stomaches - great service!The resort is a nice place - but Nusa Dua beach is a dump and the restaurant consistently upset our stomaches - seriously Kuta is a big improvement and much cleaner despite the crowds.Also you should know it takes about 30 minutes in taxi (8-15 $US) to get to Kuta or Seminyak and the number of reasonably priced restaurants in walking distance is very limited.I am very confused as to why Nusa Dua is the home to a lot of the upmarket Hotels - you would expect the beach to be nicer than Kuta et al - honestly it's not even close...Barely is a lovely place and the local people are mostly really nice but choose where you stay carefully or it may cast a distinct shadow over your holiday.

<Content>Had a Great Stay!! My friend and I stayed at this resort for one week. We had a great time! We were looking for a nice, relaxing, quiet getaway and we found it here! The staff was absolutely amazing. They were so helpful and made sure that we were having a good time. They have 2 pools, one at the hotel and one across the street from the hotel. They also have a beach area across the street from the hotel. They have a great buffet breakfast in the morning, and a good restaurant in the hotel and one across the street. They have a great spa at the resort. The staff was friendly and accommodating, and the prices were very reasonable! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing vacation!

<Content>Paradise while backpacking I have just returned from travelling and I have to say in the middle of my stop in Bali, i decided to treat myself and found the Ramada online at a great price!! i wasnt disappointed as the minute I walked into the foyer i was treated like a queen. As i was travelling on my own, i felt at ease here and my room was heaven with the doors opening out onto the pool area, and the best part was it was so quiet and peaceful. The only thing i would say is that nusa dua itself isnt a great place and and if you could stick this hotel in another location it would be even better. The restaurant across the road was really good and treated myself to a beautiful steak and bottle of wine, service was excellent and what I found after visiting many countries is that the balinese really know how to welcome you and are so friendly it was infectious!! Anyone thinking of staying here wouldnt be disappointed and i have been to many hotels around the world and couldnt find fault with this place! Top Class!!

<Content>Good value hotel I stayed here 8 nights while attending the UNFCCC meetings. Located in Benoa which is sort in between nusa dua and tourist areas of bali. Rooms were good size and well equipped. Breakfast was very generous spread and no complaints. Ordered room service couple of times because worked late and food arrived in half hour and hot. There is no beach but nice pool. Avoid the thai restaurant because it is soooooooooooooooo expensive and really not good value.

<Content>The Worst Service Ever!!! Our first year anniversary in Bali was stained by the terrible experience we had in this hotel. It's all nice and pretty, till you actually need them to do something for you. The biggest mistake on our part was when my husband wanted to arrange for a surprise for me and hv our room decorated. My husband wanted to arrange for a surprise on 5th November 2007 for me by putting up a banner stating 鈥淗appy Anniversary鈥?but upon arrival, our guide and front desk staff told us that they were having some trouble doing the banner and hence my husband had requested both, the guide AND the front desk staff that night to cancel the surprise arrangement, to which they quickly agreed. They mentioned that they were glad to cancel this arrangement as they had no idea how to create the banner and were glad they managed to get this off their back. Little did we know then, that we were going to be rudely surprised alright, on the day of the check-out!!!So we checked in on 3rd Nov and as a gesture for honeymooners, our room was decorated with standard flower arrangement, i.e. rose petals on the bed, fruits with a card stating 鈥淗appy Anniversary鈥? Everything went smoothly. The last night we were there, (5th November 2007), we requested for extra towels and when they came to deliver it to our room, they brought along a slip of paper for us to sign- USD 50 for the 鈥榮urprise鈥? which didn鈥檛 even take place! My husband told him that there was no surprise, so what was the reason to sign the bill, and the guy insisted that my husband should sign it. Perplexed, my husband refused and reaffirmed that there had been no extras in the room for us to pay for, and thankfully, he didn鈥檛 sign it!The next morning, we managed to check-out successfully without any fuss. Or so we thought. As we were waiting at the lobby for our guide to drive us to the airport, one of the front desk personnel approached us and told us to pay USD50. We again took the time to explain to her that the surprise did not happen, and there had been no extras in the room. All we had was a flower petals, and the card which were all supposed to be a part of the packaged which we have already paid for! She then told us that they had delivered a cake to us the night before at 2100 hours. We told her, we were not even in our room at 2100 hours as we only returned to the hotel past 2200 hours! Even if there was a cake, it was supposed to have been free-of-charge.The front desk personnel started raising her voice and said that her staff had already delivered the cake, and we now had to PAY FOR THE CAKE TOO! So she kept insisting over and over that we had to pay for the petals arrangement and everything extra in the room. The thing was, we didn鈥檛 see any other 鈥榚xtras鈥?in the room. In a tone that suggested we were lying, she then said she wanted to make some calls. And we told her to go right ahead! After a while she came back to us and told us again that she can confirm that they have sent a cake to our room the night before, and that we HAVE to pay for it. She was almost shouting at us right at the lobby, despite us trying to reason calmly and the situation was really unbelievable. She finally then almost spat out a curse with a hard stare, saying 鈥淚 hope your honeymoon and life is鈥︹€?The irony of the situation was we didn鈥檛 know if we were dealing with a staff of a so-called 5-star hotel, or if we were dealing with someone totally uncivilized, with not an iota of customer service in her dealings. Thanks to the 鈥榓mazing鈥?finale we had in the hotel, we left in a hurry and terribly upset. In that hurry, we left our camera at the reception table, where we were last standing and talking to the front desk over the counter. When my guide called the hotel again, the camera was no where to be seen. Of course, we are not in the position to blame anyone but ourselves for the missing camera, but we were really disappointed with the ethics of the staff as we were 100% sure that the camera was at the front desk when we left, and was in clear view of the staff. Another huge blow was, the camera contained pictures of the room on the day we arrived, and the pictures was the only proof we had they the hotel staff had not done anything extra for us, and yet are demanding for ridiculous payments. I cannot believe that Ramada Benoa is of 5-star quality. We鈥檝e stayed in about four to five 5-star hotels all over Asia before this, and this was the nastiest treatment we鈥檝e got- EVER- even in comparison to 3-star hotels in Phuket!I'm not sure if this review is gonna help any of you travellers, but its just an avenue for me to vent out the frustration. You can imagine the kind of hotel this is, if after a long complaint to the general manager of the hotel, nothing was done to compensate the difficulty we went through! Not even a simple letter of apology!Its not really the money that bothers us, its the manipulation, and we were not about to just pay and walk away as suckers. I'm really disgusted, and if you guys are dealing with this people, or arranging for surprises via the hotel staff, be extra extra careful. They are rip-offs!!!

<Content>Excellent We got a huge discount through Expedia.co.uk and as a result I have to give top marks for the value. I think that Nusa Dua isn't a great place to stay as the beach is dirty and only good for watersports. However, after a long two months backpacking we treated ourselves to a week here. The Ramada was everything we wanted. Quiet, clean and comfortable room. Great swimming pool and a wonderful buffet breakfast. The Tao restaurant is expensive by Balinese standards but we ate there three times and enjoyed every meal. Highly recommended if you want to do nothing but relax.

<Content>A Good Budget Hotel For the price we paid we can't complain but it is definately notthe best hotel we have stayed at.The Ramada has very friendly staff, good size rooms and huge king size beds. Breakfast can be a little boring, we were therefor 12 nights so it did become a little repetitious.Ramada is the last hotel in Benoa and the beachfront promenade walkway does not go that far so if you like walking it's a bit more difficult than some of the other hotels.The best thing about the hotel is the Tao beachfront restaurantit really is fabulous, the food is superb and the beachfrontsetting is perfect. It was soooo good we ate there 3 times.I think the Ramada is now in need of re furbishment, the staffhowever are really wonderful.

<Content>A great holiday My wife and I had 7 nights here in March 2007. We had a great time. Although the hotel is a little out of the way at the end of the Benoa Peninsula, we really enjoyed our stay.Walk along the beach and you will meet lots of the locals, one highlight was the village cultural tour. Our guide lived in this village and showed up his family's house, what an inside treat.We had a great lunch at one of the watersport centres on the beach. Cooked by locals for the local and the centre guests. Greta food, and very very cheap.Our highlight was the ECOcycle tour. This was a great way to see the sights.The hotel was good, the pool was great. We enjoyed the spa treatments, ended up having 2 massages a day.We stayed in a villa, very comfortable.We are planning to stay here again.

<Content>nice hotel Have just returned from two weeks at this hotel, although it is a little out the way that is it's advantage as it is quieter than Kuta area. The hotel is very well laid out in an authentic balinese way, the staff are great, the spa is good and probably one of the cheapest in the area. I had planned to stay in Kuta as well but changed my plans because I liked this hotel so much. Get taxi's to other areas instead. Take advantage of the hotels free transfers to Kuta and geger beach which is a fab little beach run by a local cooperative. Get an excellent massage by two of the older women who work on the beach for less than 10$ and then eat there as well for a pittance. Would definately go to the Tanung Benoa area of Bali again.

<Content>Amazing Hotel (if you don't need the beach) The grounds and pool areas are spectacular. The rooms are luxurious but this place is remote and the beach location is not the best. Ask the staff for a personal driver (about 35$ a day to go anywhere you want, gas included) and enjoy the island during the day.

<Content>Excellent Stay My wife and two girls were delighted with our recent stay at the Ramada-Benoa Bali. The previous disparaging review had my guard up but we found our stay contrary to his experience.We were given two excellent rooms as part of our four-night Air Asia package. Our rooms were larger and nicer than we expected. They overlooked the lushly landscaped pool area. Welcome drinks and fruit baskets added a nice touch. One small drawback was the very long walk back to our rooms though this ensured a quiet, private experience. Occupany was higher than our previous visit three years earlier but still way off peak pre-bombing levels.Service was gracious and accomodating with a we're here to please attitude abounding. The entire hotel is aging and though not a luxury property, for the price, an excellent value. Breakfasts were also better than expected.My wife and two girls splurged in their spa and each had a six-hour indulgent experience. Our girls will never forget their princess treatment. Meals were always taken out and the popular restaurant (on these boards), Casa Luna, left us dissappointed twice. Once they failed to pick us up from the hotel and then we walked out another time before ordering due to inept service.I had suits tailor-made and found reliable transportation. If you desire this info, e-mail me at: jimknies@yahoo.comMy wife and I would return to Bali in a heartbeat. Have fun till we get there.........

<Content>Disgusting We were told this was a package deal to paradise. No such luck. The hotel is situated alongside a vacant lot. This vacant lot is used as a bush toilet and the smell wafting over to the hotel Ramada is overpowering, especially in the humidity of Bali. Our shower floor had obviously never been washed, as my t-shirts were dirtier after their rinse than before I started! Added to this was a giant scorpion behind the bathroom mirror and the really average breakfasts. Needless to say we checked out after 3 of the 7 nights and moved to the splendid hotel Conrad a few hundred metres up the road.

<Content>Quiet, Pleasant, Beautiful Grounds Beautiful hotel located near end of the Tanjung Benoa peninsula, just past Nusa Dua in Bali. Though a bit remote as others have noted, there are several inexpensive and good small restaurants in walking distance (Mini Restaurant and Casa Luna both recommended). Several restaurants offer complimentary taxi service to and from the Ramada.Very clean; bed very comfortable. Staff very friendly and gracious, but if you find anything except this anywhere in Bali I would be surprised. There is a small safe in room (set own four digit combination). AC worked fine. Hot water at all times and plenty of water pressure. Very large shower stall; two shower heads (stationary and hand held). Linen and towels all clean and excellent. Standard toiletries provided; hair dryer provided. TV has reasonable selection if care about this, including BBC and CNN and HBO. All rooms have a balcony with sitting area; I recommend asking for a second floor room. There are elevators and I saw no hindrances to anyone that might be using a wheel chair.Had dinner one night at hotel; reasonable (though bit higher than outside restaurants, of course) and very good. Breakfast buffet is good if not memorable; plenty of food, always fresh. Coffee and daily fresh fruit excellent. No flies and pleasant dining areas. Always immaculate.Pool not very large but when we were there, never crowded. Grounds are beautiful and very very nicely maintained - the serene and beautiful walk to room from the front desk was always nice.Beach across street - clean, private, guarded, and will not be bothered by beach hawkers. Food and drinks available at beach and pool from mid-day till around 7:00pm. Plenty of water sports outlets available on both sides of hotel - will be asked about interest in as soon as step foot on beach.Daily free shuttle to Kuta; hourly shuttle to upscale shopping center in Nusa Dua. Taxi to Kuta about $12 each way. No problem finding taxi; recommend Blue Bird.Occupancy rate at all hotels in Bali right now noticeably low. Ramada had mostly Taiwanese groups while we stayed there but others as well. Occupancy I think was probably below 20% - never crowded in any way. If you have not visited Bali since bombings, biggest difference that is evident is guards - they are outside all hotels and restaurants, patrol hotel grounds, etc..Return to Bali! They need us and the people are as gracious, welcoming, and warm as ever, with an amazing culture set among a beauty (in the countryside) that is unsurpassed. Don't let the terrorists win. Bali economy is suffering - they need visitors to return.This hotel would not work for those seeking lot of activity and close proximity to club scene or similar but it is an excellent value and I think just right for a family or couple seeking an affordable, relaxing holiday away from all the hustle and bustle.

<Content>The Shining... Huge and comfortable bed, bathroom was kinda clean and it has a huge stone frog statue sitting at a corner, friendly staff - although the housekeeping staff kept knocking at our door at 7.30 am every morning asking us if they could clean our room! The breakfast was average. While we were there, the hotel was really quiet...kinda like The Shining. The distance of the hotel to the centre of Kuta is far (about a 45 minute shuttle van ride provided by the hotel once a day) and it is situated in the middle of nowhere.
