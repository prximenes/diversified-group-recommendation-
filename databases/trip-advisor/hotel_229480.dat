<Content>Value for money I'm a traveling consultant and stayed in a variety of hotels. Was spending 3 nights in Amsterdam for vacation. Got hotel from priceline for $80 USD/night. Location 5 min walk from metro station / tram / train terminal, which took another 20 min to get into the center canal rings. Train from airport was only 10 min.Room was spacious and NEW. Bathroom looked new, spacious and clean. flat screen TV and nice selections from minibar. Loved the lighting in the room (dimmable lights on ceiling above each bed had a luxurious feel).Room was GREAT value for the money. Public transportation will get you into the center of action in no time so location was not a problem. Will definitely stay again if found a similar deal.

<Content>A good choice for families Amsterdam is a fascinating city, but I always find it hard there to get hotels for a good value that are well suited for families. The Holyday Inn is such a hotel. It is not in the inner city but 5 minutes from the subway and train station RAI, which means you can get there by public transport easily if you arrive by plane or train. It also takes you 15 minutes to get to the inner city with the metro. It is an ideal starting point for exploring the city and its surroundings. The hotel is localized next to the Amsterdam conference center and they offer really good rates if there are no conferences and also on weekends. The rooms are nice and they also offer a sumptuous breakfast buffet. The rooms with two double beds sleep a family of four and could be a little bigger, but are ok for a weekend stay.

<Content>Very pleasant stay I stayed at this hotel in August 2008 for a conference at the Rai convention centre. The hotel is not in the centre of Amsterdam but is in an excellent loctaion for the Rai centre. It was approximatley 5mins walk to the conference centre, and 5mins walk to the train and tram station which take you into the centre of Amsterdam and Schipol Airport. The rooms were clean and pleasant and the hotel had a nice restaurant and a bar which served bar snacks.I would recommend this hotel if you want a hotel in easy reach of the city centre and Schipol Airport, or for it's location to the Rai centre.

<Content>What you would expect from a Holiday Inn The Holiday Inn was fine. Alittle expensive when I compare the price to the Holiday Inn in Munich where I stayed 2 night later. The room was fine. It had everything you could need. I didn't eat breakfast so can't comment on that.The location is no great shakes but you can get the No 4 tram to city centre. It was only a couple of minutes walk to the tram stop.I'd plan to stay somewhere different when next in Amsterdam, somewhere closer to city centre.Good hairdryer

<Content>Ok stay I was at a conference at the VU university, which was a 10 minute walk or a two tram stop ride from the hotel. The number 4 tram takes you to central station if you want to go into the heart of Amsterdam. There are no supermarkets or eating areas anywhere near the hotel.I had something go missing from my room, which took 4 days to resolve. I was eventually refunded and given a late check out but it was a service debacle, with me having to chase up the hotel staff. Some of the staff had difficulties with English also. However, the rooms were very clean and the hotel is non smoking which was a plus.I would have stayed more in the heart of Amsterdam, closer to amenities if I had my time there again. Taking the tram for 30 minutes each way just to get something to eat (as it is far too expensive at the hotel) or see the sights was too taxing.

<Content>Nice, comfortable hotel This hotel is about a fifteen minute tram ride from downtown Amsterdam. The check in was very easy and the staff was very nice. The hotel itself was very nice. The rooms were large and clean and the bathroom was exceptional. Our sofa bed had no sheets on it when we pulled it out so I asked the maid that was down the hall for some. He did not speak English but he must have told someone we needed something because about 2 minutes later the hotel staff was at our door with everything we needed. I liked the fact that the hotel was not downtown as it was nice to be able to get away from the city center. The only drawback was that there were no restaurants or stores to get food in the general area. There is a shopping center down the road about a mile that does have a grocery store but its a little far if you have no car. We took a cab from the train station because we had no idea where to go and that cost around 40 Euros but the tram #4 goes directly from the train station to the RAI station and only cost aout 7Euros for 4 people. We would definitely stay here again. The surrounding area was pretty and the hotel was really comfortable. We did not eat in the restaurant but it was usually busy with business travelers so I would guess it was good although from the menu we looked at it was a little pricey.

<Content>Nice hotel near convention center My husband had a conference at the RAI (pronounced rye) convention center at the end of May 2008, so we stayed here 4 nights. It was a good experience overall. Breakfast was pricey (20 euros for the buffet), and we only did that once. We had requested a deluxe room to accommodate our 2 kids, and were surprised to find the room had 2 double beds and a small sofa. If the sofa had been pulled out we wouldn't have had room for luggage, but didn't need the extra space. It was a good sized room. The room was clean and the bathroom was fine. The kids like the chocolates put on our pillows each night.The front desk was helpful, making suggestions for sightseeing, transportation, selling tram tickets, etc. The hotel was a bit out of the way, but price and location to the convention center made it good for us.We took the train from the Airport to RAI station (different line than going to central station) and had less than 5 minute walk to the hotel. The tram stop was between hotel and train station and very efficient. Trams left every 10 minutes or so. It took about 30 minutes to get to the city center. We used strippenkart, which is a series of 15 strips for the tram. Each trip to downtown cost 3 strips each way, but you get a discount if you buy them in bulk (6.90 euros for 15 strips). Strips are stamped on the tram, and are good for 1 hour on any tram. Transfers are easy.RAI convention center is about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. Nearest restaurants are on the other side of the convention center, along with a Albert Heijn grocery store (good for prepared food, fruit, bread, cheese, and most other needs).

<Content>Lovely Hotel This is a lovely hotel - stayed here for 2 nights. Location not so central although there is no problem in getting to the centre as the transport is very regular (trains  trams). I have stayed in a central location also but hotel not so good for value. This was definitely better value for money but be prepared to travel to the centre

<Content>Great place to stay Stayed in the hotel for three nights with the other half recently.Rooms:The rooms are large by european standards and have two double beds even when you book for two adults only.Accessibility:Ten minuters from schipol.Take the stoptrein from Schipol and get off at RAI Amsterdam.Come out of the station and turn right and right again at the corner of the building you pass next.Its a less than 3 minute walk to the hotel.To go into town take the GVB tram line 4.Retrace the route to RAI station ....you will pass the Drentepark station (50 meters from the RAI....and the origin point of line 4 and therefore always easy to get seats for the 15 minute ride into the city.)Location:In the industrial section of Amsterdam.....therefore not too many restaurants around ....food at the hotel is expensive.... but plenty of restaurants enroute to the city centre on line 4Overall:Absolutely no complaints and a great place to stay

<Content>Great position to visit Amsterdam We've reached the hotel by car, and been there for 3 nights.Parking is very small, but we hadn't any difficulty in finding a place for our car; the price for it is not so cheap, 20 euros, 27 in other parking outside the hotel.People at reception are very polite.The hotel is clean, 4 stars.Rooms are quite, with good beds and spaces are good.Breakfast is very good.At 200mt there is the tram stop and at 300mt there is the train stop.With the tram in 15 minutes we were in rembrandtplein.Very good solution.

<Content>An excellent experience This hotel is a great alternative to expensive rooms in the city center, since it's just a three-minute walk to the RAI train station. Buy a day pass on the metro line and save money on accommodations. It's also very convenient to/from Schipol Airport by rail. We were able to get a very good rate by bidding online, and since it was Easter week and there were no business travelers they upgraded us to an executive suite on one of the upper floors. Really nice room, great view, comfortable beds and ultra clean. All the amenities you'd expect for a good business-class hotel. The only drawback was that the nearest area with restaurants is about a 15 minute walk. So it's about as quick to take a train into town for dinner. But we were quite happy with the hotel and it was much better than a typical Holiday Inn in the states.Note: Tourists might want to check on whether a convention is in town before booking, since this hotel caters primarily to the nearby RAI convention center. You'll probably find better deals on weekends and holidays.

<Content>Nice stay at the Holiday Inn stayed one night at the Holiday Inn in Amsterdam.The hotel was not in the main city center, but within a very short walk was the tram into the city.The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.The room was modern and fairly big and a very nice bed.The bathroom was also nice, with a large tub.My only complaint was the breakfast, it was a buffet and it cost $23.00 and was not very good.

<Content>A nice stay at the Holiday Inn! I stayed at the Holiday Inn Amsterdam for 5 days in late December with my girlfriend. We had stayed in the Amsterdam city center on the first leg or our trip and I booked the Holiday Inn through P*riceline ($95 US) as a less expensive alternative on our last leg.The hotel is located on the outer ring of the city, but it is less than a 3 mile walk to the heart of Amsterdam and about 1.5 miles to the Van Gogh museum. It is located right next to the RAI station and the beginning of tram line directly into the city. The proximity to the RAI station proved to be a great benefit as it was only 1 stop from the airport and allowed us to avoid the obscenely expensive Dutch taxis. It also made a day trip to Haarlem very accessible.We stayed in a large room with a comfortable king bed and good bathroom. It was larger than most European rooms and much better than the Holiday Inns where I have stayed in the United States. Ultimately, I found staying at the Holiday Inn to be a great budget alternative to staying in the city center (which I also recommend if the price is right). It is located across the road from a nice city park (with a large hedge maze - recommended for kids and adults) with easy access to the city. My only regret is not being able to visit during the warmer months. Renting a bike (I think you can rent them under the RAI station) and exploring the city would have been awesome. Maybe next time.

<Content>Great base on the transit line. I wanted to select a hotel in Amsterdam that was outside the city centre, yet still be able to easily get into the city and the airport. The Holiday Inn fit the bill perfectly.The exterior looks a little dated, but the interior of the property more than makes up for it. The interior and rooms are very comfortable, and much better than I was expecting as I rarely choose to stay at Holiday Inns when I travel.The hotel was not exceptional in any way; however, it was comfortable and suited our needs quite well during our stay.

<Content>Great location and service! All of the BBs were booked up as it was during the holidays. Our travel agent suggested the Holiday Inn. It was located right next to the Station Rai railway which is only two or three stops from the airport and very cheap (3 euros each way) and next to a tram stop which brings you to downtown within 15 minutes. The hotel was clean, the service excellent, and the hot American-style breakfast very good and worth the extra cost. We would definitely recommend staying there and plan to return next Spring or Summer.

<Content>Excellent Base My partner booked a suprise visit to Amsterdam for my birthday on August Bank Holiday weekend and we stayed at the HI Amsterdam. Once we got to check in, the receptionist upgraded us to a Executive room, which was very spacious and had nice clear views. Now being as it's Amsterdam and a fairly big City, i did expect the rooms to be on the smaller side but was very suprised. Bearing in mind the actual hotel isn't central, it is about 2 miles out the the center. Don't let that put you off as over the road from the hotel you have the Train station which goes to and from Schipol Airport. Also it is very easy to get in and out of the City as there is a Tram Service around the corner. Takes approximately 15 mins to get into town, but you do get to see all the wonderful buildings on your way to the City. The hotel is very friendly and perfect for a City break away. We did have breakfast at this hotel and it has to be said it was a treat. As it is a buffet breakfast, you can eat as much as you want and you will be full for the rest of the day until tea. We also ate Dinner at the hotel, and was expecting to pay high prices but was pleasently suprised to find the prices reasonable. I do recommend you eat at the hotel as this was a very pleasent experience.

<Content>Good hotel at RAI The Holiday Inn is located near RAI, a conference center. Booking this hotel was mainly a price issue for us, as their prices are very competitive. The airport transfer is very easy by train, the fare is EUR 2.50 one-way, the ride takes only 10 min. and the trains run every 15 minutes. The train station RAI is only 5 min. away from the hotel. Going downton is also easy by tram. For frequent trips it is best to buy a 1/2/3-day pass, we paid EUR 13.50 for 3 days of unlimited rides.Breakfast was excellent, very nice selection, it comes at a price of EUR 20.--. For cheaper breakfast options: there is nothing near the hotel, except a little convenience store at RAI station that may sell sandwiches or coffee... you may have to go downtown for more choice. There was no service directory in our room. When checking out, we found out the service directory was on the TV now..... we found out too late, as we missed breakfast one day, being too late. There is a historic windmill only 10 min. walking time from the hotel... ask at the reception, they will give you directions how to get there if you are keen to see it.Overall, we had a very nice stay at this hotel, I can only recommend it.

I stayed there for 5 days for a conference at the RAI and walked 5 minutes to the conference. I also went into the city center every evening using the nearby tram 4 which was really convinient. it is also very close to the metro and trains to get anywhere you want.

<Content>A Comfortable Stay Hi,I stayed at Holiday Inn during my 3 days business trip to Amsterdam. I was put up on the 11th Floor and my window overlooked the city lights during night time. It was quite near to the Schiphol Airport and I was charged EUR 30 for one way drop by taxi from Airport. The hotel is well connected with public transport (Station RAI) by Tram and Metro nearby.a) Room Quality  Amenities: The room quality and amenities were quite good especially the toilet was quite neat and clean.b) Room Service: Though I did not order much but whenever I needed some amenities, they were promptly attended to by the staff. So there were no complaints on that end.c) Staff Response: I particularly liked the warmth of the Porter, who would traditionally guide guests at the hotel on how to go about navigating around Amsterdam. He in fact went out of his way to printout a route map for me to reach my office destination and explained several ways in which I could reduce my personal cost of stay in Amsterdam.d) Negative Aspect #1: The hotel itself is a little far off from the city. Though there is a regular tram service and a metro service to the City Centraal (The centre of the city), where most of the activities really happened, it took about 30 minutes one way to reach the center of the city. It was certainly inconvenient to catch a tram everyday after returning from office. One prefers not to travel much after a long hard day.e) Negative Aspect #2: This is particular to 'Vegetarians (No meat no fish variety like me)'. There was hardly much to eat at the Restaurant of the hotel. Also there weren't any food outlets in the vicinity of the hotel where one could just walk across for having dinner or food. So I had to go to the city every time that I need to have vegetarian food.Overall, I had a comfortable stay at Hotel Holiday Inn but due to its distance from the city's center, it became incovenient to travel to the city for food and sightseeing. I would certainly recommend this hotel to people who are there in Amsterdam on Business and have a short stay and want to stay nearer to the Airport.

<Content>Great as usual I stay at this hotel quite often for business and am always very pleased with the service, friendliness, free upgrades to executive rooms, decent breakfast (although they don't serve soy milk, eventhough requested).The executive rooms are wonderful, beds are great. Some rooms have a whirlpool, free complimentary drinks (2), chocolate, etc.No complaints whatsoever.If you're looking for a hotel only two trainstops from the airport and you can live with the fact you are not downtown amsterdam (15 - 20 minutes traveling), then this is the place to stay for business or pleasure!

<Content>really nice place - just a few small quibbles We stayed at this hotel in August for a night and had very few complaints considering we got the room for a STEAL from Priceline.com. The rooms were big, spacious, modern, the staff were friendly and the place was conveniently located next to a tram station for easy access to the town center. The bathroom had modern fittings and everything was clean and nice. That breakfast wasn't included in the room price, and that we weren't informed of this BEFORE eating it, is a small quibble. However, it was only 鈧?0 each and it was a REALLY GOOD buffet breakfast. - still 鈧?0 is quite a lot - and there are NO OTHER options in the neighbourhood that we could findThe rooms, particularly the smoking-permitted rooms - could have done with better ventilation. With only 1 smoker in our party of 2, the smoke quickly filled up the room... the smoker in question resorted to smoking in the bathroom where the ventilation was better - none of the windows opened. The hotel was under renovations when we visited but this, while unsightly in the lobby and on the restaurant level, did not cause any problems.

<Content>Very well located, recently renovated hotel that offers included breakfast We go to Amsterdam every year for the same event. This was the fifth time in a row, and because the location of the event changes, we have changed hotel almost every year.The Holiday Inn Amsterdam is located on a 2-minute walk from the RAI subway and train station, which brings you in a short 10-minute drive to the Amsterdam Central Station. Very easy to get to the centre of town.It was mentioned on the Holiday Inn website that the hotel had been recently renovated. The room was clean, no smoke odours were present (we asked for a non-smoking room) and of acceptable size. Not too big, but there was ample space for a sofa and a table next to the beds.Breakfast was 15鈧?per person, but the hotel offers a breakfast-included option, which is considerably cheaper, certainly when you don't travel alone. Breakfast was very extensive and high quality, with the staff always willing to help when you have special requirements (or you just want your eggs in a fashion they don't do normally). Nice atmosphere also, the breakfast room was cosy, and not too big.I'll be back next year, this was a flawless stay.

<Content>Great value for money We've just returned from a weekend holiday in Amsterdam. Three of us stayed at Holiday Inn Amsterdam. The reason we chose this hotel was because Holiday Inn was one of few that accomodate triple occupancy.Don't judge the hotel from outside as it looks like a state housing apartment block. Inside was nice and morden- reception area was cosy.The room was spacious and it had two double beds. We thought the beds were a bit too small to be double but were very comfortable. When we arrived, the room only had 2 sets of towels even though we booked and paid triple occupancy rate in advance. When I called the reception for more towels, a maid delivered them literally in one minute.Bathroom was also spacious and clean. Water pressure in shower was so powerful it was almost painful-other two loved it and thought it was like one of those high pressured massaging showers. The hotel is quite far from the city centre- 20 minutes by tram number 4. Best to buy 15 strips (6.80 euros) from GVB ticket office outside the centraal station. Tram attendant stamps 3 strips for Station Rai. Staion Rai is the last stop for Tram 4 so you don't have to worry about when to get off. Holiday Inn is right next to the station. (You'll probably spot Novotel first when you get off. Holiday Inn is just before Novotel). Tram runs from 6am to 12.30am. Night bus runs from 12.30am to 6am hourly so you can get get back to the hotel by public transport anytime of the day/night easily. We also lesuirely walked to museum quarter during the day and took us 35 minutes through lovely Beatrix park. There's nothing much to do or see around the hotel- mainly office blocks around the hotel.Overall, we very much enjoyed staying at Holiday Inn and it was such a good value for money. We didn't mind travelling 20 minutes to the hotel as public transport was excellent and we could all get good night sleep in a quiet area away from the busy city centre.I highly recommend Holiday Inn Amsterdam.

<Content>Mixed experience The rooms were nice and clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. The location was also ok as the hotel could easily be reached from the airport and public transport to the city was freaquent. I didn't like the fact that there were no cafes or restaurants in the area and that the hotel exploited this charging 20 euros for a breakfast that should have cost less than 10. The hotel was also greedy when it came to other things. For instance they charged 0,35 euros for internet, a service most hotels provide for free. Another thing I didn't like is that the hotels show clips from pornographic movies (pay tv). I would not have liked my children to coincidentally flip to these channels. It is also an experience I could have done without. I do not like hotels that sell porno at all, but I could accept it if these films were showed on request only.

<Content>Unhappy experience Stayed there with family in August 2007. We were 2 adults and 2 children. The location is secluded with nothing around. Not at all suitable if holidaying with family especially children.The staff are anything but friendly and courteous. They need training on Customer service and understanding the needs of families.Almost everything had to be ordered twice. When you call for the second time (after having given 30-45 minutes time), the new person on the line  first mentions it was not me you called so I am not responsible and then tries to help (no team work).Very difficult to get help if you are traveling with heavy luggage.Would never stay there. It definitely does not maintain Holiday Inn standards.Being close to the airport would suit the transit passenger who needs a bed to sleep overnight and take a shower. Nothing more.

<Content>Would Stay Again We stayed at the Holiday Inn Amsterdam for our 30th Anniversary . The hotel was easy to find from the airport which is good when you are jetlagged and tired. There was renovations taking place, however, from our room it wasn't that noticeable. The rooms were very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. It was convenient to Tram 4 which would take you into the city. We liked going to the city during the day and evening, then returning to a nice, quiet hotel away from the city, for a good night sleep. We didn't eat at the hotel, but did shop at the gift shop and found it very pleasant and reasonable. We would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Pretty average! This hotel was very ordinary. It was clean enough but the bathroom was very old and not that nice. The room was comforable enough and the bed linen was clean. The hotel restaurant was nice but a bit pricey. Room service was ok but again a bit over-priced. It's a long way out of Amsterdam - about 20-25 minutes by Tram number 4, which is located right near the hotel. Amsterdam itself is quite horrible! It is very dirty with rubbish all over the streets. We did our best to go on tours away from the city. The tours were not as good as we had hoped for. Overall, the hotel was just ok, but if you want good quality don't stay at the Holiday Inn!

<Content>Good quality and value The Holiday Inn Amsterdam is a good quality hotel and does represent good value for money. There is a lot of building work in the lobby at present so it can be crowded and messed up in this area when a lot of people around but the staff are doing well.The rooms are good size, clean and comfortable.The bar and restaurant are good quality although beer is expensive....Taxi to town is 10 minutes and 20 euros, tram is 20 minutes and 2.40 euros.Overall a good hotel but a little way out of town.

<Content>Third Time Lucky? Third visit here because the first two were so great as reported in previous reviews.Still a good hotel with nice rooms and good transport links to the centre of course. What was wrong this time? No one member of staff made any impression. That's not a problem as everything was fine. But on the previous occasions, staff at the hotel made us feel like we mattered. In fact, the reason we've returned here to celebrate special family occasions is down to one member of staff, now retired, who made such a great impression on us on our first visit. She won our repeat business; nobody did this time.

<Content>Convenient family stay Have just returned from a 3 day stay at this Hoiday Inn with my family (2 kids age 11 and 8). We booked this hotel because it was the only one we could find (easily) which had family rooms to accommodate all 4 of us:with breakfast included. From the outside the hotel was uninspiring: it was in a business type paryk near a very busy road, with a horrid dirty pond of water in front. However, inside it was clean and comfortabler and decent value. It was v easy to get into the city centre (20 mins by tram from just outside the hotel. The staff were all v friendly. On the whole, a fine base for a trip, good value, but a bit further out than would have been ideal.

<Content>Great Location, easy to find Stayed one night in May at the Holiday Inn in Amsterdam based on the reviews. The location was great, next to the train station and easy access to the highway.Parking was a little expensive given your out in the suburbs and there are lots of open spaces around.Had dinner in the dinning room which was excellent. I recommend the Halibut it was excellent. The caesar salad was ok, but not traditional north american style.Room was a good size with lots of English speaking tv stations which was a big bonus, after having to watch CNN and BBC news for the previous few nights.If I went back to Amsterdam I would definate consider staying here again.

<Content>Grest for Flexibility Good place to stay away from hurly burly of centre of City. Tram no. 4 great - always one waiting! Train service also great - both within 3-4 minute walk of Hotel - advantage you have is it is end of line for Tram hence so easy to catch! Staff at Hotel - really friendly. 4 in family room (2 x large beds a real squish but get what you pay for). Air con. noisy and as ever struggled with fact couldn't open a window!!!Few tips - Hotel food we found expensive but good - soon adds up though if you are a family on a budget! Plenty of Albert Heijns (Supermarkets) in City and on way back on Tram from City to Hotel - OK gereral supermarket... Brill. Sirop Waffles (don't bother with tourist versions - half the price of them and really good...FYI Roombotter (rough spelling) means butter which is trad. type and best!!!Discovered great Thai Restaurant roughly half way on tram from City to Hotel (left hand side of road as heading out of City - also has Albert Heijn nearby. Great food and really charismatic host - near to Canal Bridge nr. Victorie Plein stop, Not cheap but chaper than hotel and great entertainment from host.Ann Frank House and Van Gogh queues for entrance at venues real pain and very long for Ann Frank - TIP go to Centraal Station... opposite main entrance is a large ticket bureau...go in there pay for tickets and they give you a time slot of one hour for admission on date/time you want. When you get to Ann franks/Van Gogh go to pre-booked tickets entrance - no need to queue and get in staright away - commission charge really minimal and worth it! You get discounted Strippenkarts there to.Late tip for Keukenof (bulbfields etc.). Best bet go to Schipol airport - easy on train from Hotel and book with small travel company in arrivals/departures - can't remember their name but on Keukenhof Website. Price includes Bus fare and entrance ... real no hassle stuff and accept credit cards which are not accepted in anywhere near so many places as UK. Really glad to have gone with them - avoided all the massive main route traffic jams, and got bonus of drive through actual bulbfields which others charge for as extra as part of trip.Have a great time!

<Content>Way Better than a American Holiday Inn My boyfriend and I spent four days at this Holiday Inn and loved it.Here is why we recommend it:-Super friendly staff.We arrived at the hotel at 6 am and were prepared to beg the front desk to allow us to check-in 8 hours early. We even considered paying a half day's rate. But the night manager immediately approved our early check-in free of charge. We didn't even have to ask nicely. -Clean and modern rooms.We didn鈥檛 expect much from this hotel, after all it is a Holiday Inn. But our standard room was comparable to a four-star Hilton in the states. The bed was comfortable, the shower had a massage shower head, and the room service was decent. -Location.The hotel is about a 15 minute metro ride and 20 minute tram ride from downtown. It was nice to hang out in a residential neighborhood rather than with the tourists. Plus, it is only two stops away from the airport via the suburban rail line. Don't waste money on a cab. Take the train from the airport.Here are the few things that upset up:-The high-speed internet cost 17 Euros per day.-Commuting to the museums did start to annoy us by the end of our trip, but we got what we paid for.

<Content>Great Standard of Holiday Inn Just got back from a weekend in Amsterdam (17th -19th Mar). We (4 people) arrived at Central Station and took a taxi to the hotel (22 euro's). I was a bit worried that the hotel would be too far from the city centre but 22 euro's between four people isn't bad. Looking at the hotel from the outside we were a bit worried that the hotel would not live up to our expectations but on entering we found the hotel to be great. Decor was very nice and the bedrooms has recently been refurbished and seemed larger than average with big windows, mini bar, flat screen tv, workstation and an oversided bed. Like the other reviews state the tram stop is practically outside the hotel and I would say tram 4 takes less than 15 minutes into the centre of Amsterdam (near the flower market) for nearly 3 euro's. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Amsterdam for a short break however if you plan to stay longer than a few days I would suggest a hotel nearer the centre.

<Content>Nice hotel! My wife and I stayed here for four days when visiting Amsterdam. The hotel itself isn't near the downtown area at all, but that's ok. We chose it because it was a 5-minute walk to the metro and then a 20-minute ride to downtown. The rooms here are on the bigger size, and we found the staff to be super friendly and gave great directionsto get us to the Keukenhof which was an hour away. My wife found it very funny they have a restaurant called The Vermont (great food!) since she's from Vermont. WHen checking out we saw that they did add an extra 20 euros a day for breakfast when we never ate breakfast there. They took it off our bill without a problem when we pointed that out. Overall, it's a great place!

<Content>excellent experience! Just arrived from a 5 day leisure trip in Amsterdam. Our experience at holiday inn was extremely fantastic! Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, breakfast had many options to chose from, room and bathroom were above expectations. We agree with other reviewers when it comes to distance to Amsterdam downtown, but in a very short walk distance (less than 2 minutes) it is possible to take tram 4 to major city tourist attractions (it takes around 15 to 20 minutes - tickets can be purchase with discount in the hotel). RAI Station is also in a very short distance and from there it is possible to go to Schiphol Airport and several other locations. No complaints at all!

<Content>Convenient  This Holiday Inn is situated right next to the Station Rai. You can get to Rai from Schiphol Airport via IC in about 10 minutes for 2,20 Euros. Tram 4's stop is right by the hotel. A 15 strip card comes handy. 3 strips to Centraal Station. Trams run till late night anyways.The bar has a section for priority club with free access to internet for platinum members.The restaurant is good. Breakfast is excellent. People are very customer friendly. Rooms are clean. Overall we were very happy with our stay - shamanth vyas

<Content>Very nice Very nice breakfast buffet with absolutely no shortcomings. Rooms were ok - we ordered on with two separate beds and they were huge! So huge that they made the room a bit cramped, but they were very nice to sleep in.The only real problem with this hotel is the location. We enjoy being near to the centre of things and this was a bit out of the way. However, it is very close to train and bus stops.

<Content>Good hotel and service Stayed here for one night whilst watching the Holland v England football friendly. Really we weren't in the hotel long enough to do it justice, but it was in a great location. Far enough away from the main centre to be quiet, but easy enough to get about due to the tram and metro stop right next door. The hotel service was extremely good, friendly, polite and efficient. Our room was large, comfortable and very clean. After 2 or 3 visits, I'm not that keen on Amsterdam as a city break - the museums are really good, but after that one afternoon wandering around is enough to pick up the atmosphere and see the sites. That said, if I was here again, I'd certainly stay in the Holiday Inn.

<Content>Good quality hotel Stayed at this hotel for one night, thought for a holiday inn the hotel quality was excellent. The rooms were well appointed the staff were outstanding and the public areas well maintained and well decorated. The hotel is a little out of the city centre, however, it isa only 15-20 minutes by tram or metro both of which are 2 minutes walk from the hotel reception. (the lady conductor on the tram was a right snotty [-] but ehh!). I would definitely recommend this hotel, as a regular holiday inn stayer this is one of the best which I have been to.

<Content>OK, but expensive We stayed August 2-5, and August 10-12, 2006 in room 920. We booked directly using the hotel website and paid 141 euros for week nights and 124 euros for the Friday nights. Additionally, we paid 5% and a fee to Master Card. It seemed like a steep cost, especially after having stayed two weeks in Las Vegas at the Mega Resorts for next to nothing. Also, we were not able to receive a lower rate for use of the Entertainment Card, which is listed on their web site.The best aspect of this hotel is the service. We especially appreciated the concierge men, who helped us on twice: once to locate a quality hotel on the Island of Terschelling and a second time to find us bubble wrap so that we could pack our numerous jars of cranberries from Terschelling. (We could not bring liquids or gels on the flight on August 12th.) Also of service were: the lady at the front desk who put us in a room with a view and the numerous people who gave me attention when using the safety deposit box, which I needed as I was carrying valuables that I did not want to carry in a purse on the streets.Room 920 had not been renovated. It was OK, but sort of old and in need of renovation.My friend joined the Priority Club. I expect we will stay their again. She really loves the place because of the location outside of the city.I think the buffet breakfast was the best. We got up early every morning and ran down for a delicious cup of coffee and eveything imaginable.What I did not like about it was: there is no way to open a window and the room really needed some fresh air. Also, I wanted a pool. I was so tired when we got there, and a refreshing swim would be nice.I expect to be back there again. I can't wait for a delicious breakfast and the tram ride into the city center!

<Content>Great place to stay Reviewer from Jerusalem, IsraelI stayed at the Holiday Inn with my two teenage sons for four nights in the first week in August and paid 100 Euros a night including breakfast and all taxes. It's very difficult to fault this hotel at this price level and star rating. The reasonably-sized, air-conditioned rooms are very quiet, well appointed, immaculately clean and cleaned, and have superbly comfortable beds. The bathrooms are modern and very clean. The hotel's common areas are, like the rooms, in tip-top condition. The hot and cold buffet breakfast options are generous, varied and well cooked. Service is great: the hotel staff are very friendly, polite, cheerful, helpful, knowledgable and efficient.If you want a central Amsterdam location this hotel is not for you. But if you don't, the Holiday Inn is ideally located in a quiet business, convention center and park neighborhood. The number 4 tram line stop and the Rai metro and rail station are both just a 100-metre walk away. The center of town or Schiphol airport are thus just a 15-min ride away by either tram or train.A few caveats: be careful of the automated mini bar, and prepare yourself for a hefty 20 Euro a day parking charge if you bring your car.A few tips: tram, metro and rail tickets can be purchased from the hotel reception at a lower price than from the tram driver or at the station. The mini market cum ticket office at Rai station closes at around five each evening. Unless you can work out how to use the ticket machines in the station, think carefully how you intend to make your evening metro and train ticket purchases.

<Content>Good hotel for family stay From N. America, we were looking for reservation of a reasonable hotel in Amsterdam for summar and found Holiday Inn as value for money. 94 euros per night. Additional advantage is that rates for weekend do not increase unlike downtown hotels.Due to large baggage for one cab, we booked a van at 12 euro per person from outside airport to hotel.The hotel building from outside is not very impressive but many upper floor rooms are renovated with spacious and very clean bathrooms. Room sizes are decent by european standard and little tighter by american standard.The staff was very friendly. Although check in starts at 2 pm, they gave us room earlier when we reached hotel. The hotel is in business district and easily accessible by tram and rail. Tram # 4 starts from RAI which is few meters from hotel. Starting points helps taking proper position in tram to secure from pickpocketers.It was a good travel of 15 minutes by tram and we could identify hotels for dinner on the way. We bought 72 hour I amsterdam card which allows unlimited travel with free entry to many attractions.We asked hotel to block bar and non-family TV channels so that there were no surprizes while check out.High speed internet was at 22 euro per 24 hours. Steeper by american standard but it was really high speed like cable. Much better than DSL.Overall it was a good stay.

<Content>Great Place to Stay in Amsterdam We booked this hotel through Hotwire and would stay here again! Being next to the RAI Station helps to get around. We bought a 72 hour pass and were in business. Extra friendly staff. Very much worth the money and much cheaper than the hotel accross the street! Rooms were very nice! We left here to stay near the airport, and had a nightmare at NH Schiphol for our one night stay!

<Content>In the outskirts, but near exhibition center The hotel migth be OK, but the location; end of line 4 tram, if you are a vacation visitor to Amsterdam, it migth be OK, you see a lot of Amsterdam during the 20 minutes or so into town.I think the room looked just like all Holiday Inns did in the 1970, and i think only textiles may have been refurbished since then. But, size of room and beds are good. Employees very nice and helpful. We had dinner in the Vermont restaurant in the hotel, and it was very good, and much better than the french restaurant in the Novotel across the street. From the airport, take the trains that goes to RAI ( amsterdam exhibition center ) 2.nd stop from the airport, short walk to hotel. But not all trains ( like those to Amsterdam Centraal ) do not stop at RAI. Taxi fare into Leidse plein approc 15 - 20 euros.

<Content>Great Hotel We had the opportunity to stay at this hotel during a flight connection to the USA. It was an excellent facility. The rooms are furnished with modern conviences and was very clean. The staff was friendly and accomodating. It is less than 5 minutes walk from the train and trams where you can be anywhere from the airport to Central station in the heart of Amsterdam within 20 minutes. We would recommend this facility to business travelers as well as families.

<Content>efficient and quiet It seems I stayed at a different hotel to some reviewers. The front desk staff were very efficient at check in and out. The barman was equally efficient and even friendly by Amsterdam standards. My room was spacious and comfortable and because the hotel is located out of the centre it was very quiet with no late night revellers to disturbe your sleep. The distance from the centre was not a problem as the metro runs frequently with a journey of less than 15mins. Would definitely stay again.

<Content>A Desperately Poor Hotel The biggest issue this hotel has are the walls. There too close together and should have been built in different part of town.The rooms are to small for the furniture.There is nothing to do in the evening 鈥?20 min walk to find a restaurant. Every where around it is a building site. Oh and it is very expensive.Oh and the bath filled with sewage every time you used the sink.Oh window would not shutDid I mention that there was no floor space because they had tried to fit in two double beds and two chairs and a table鈥?

<Content>Positive Experience My husband and I have just returned from a nine night stay at the Holiday Inn in Amsterdam. We had some reservations after reading other reviews. However, for us it was a good choice. While there were not restaurants nearby, the tram and metro stops were within a 5 minute walk and the city center was approximately a 15 minute tram ride. Since we are in our 50s, we had dinner in the city center and returned to the hotel by 10pm. Another plus for the location is the easy access from the airport. There is a train that goes directly from the airport to the RAI station without having to go to Central Station. The walk from the station to the hotel is approximately 5 minutes also.The first eight floors of the hotel have been renovated recently. We did not have one of those rooms the first night since the hotel was full. However, they moved us the next day and our room was large, clean, and comfortable for the remainder of the time. When we checked out, we did not have any extra charges added to the bill.

<Content>another priceline scam Just like every other Holiday Inn anywhere in the USA. Terrible Location, Front desk staff had a terrible attitude. The room was adequate, boring and the hotel had no personality. It was nothing more than a place to sleep in a great city. We were charged automatically for breakfast everyday and had to ask each day for the charges to be removed from our bill. Personally I think that's a little unscrupulous, we were also charged everytime we touched something in the mini-bar. I didn't say consumed, I said touched. Little insignificant annoying petty practices by the management make this hotel a place that I will NEVER visit again. If Priceline sticks you there, check your bill..
