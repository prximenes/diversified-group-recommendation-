<Content>Simply the best From the moment we arrived at the Water Spa Villa until the time we left, the service and amenities were exemplory. The staff were so friendly and eager to please and were always happy and very helpful.The villa itself had everything we needed, with very comfortable furnishings and beautiful surroundings.The spa treatments been greatly missed since arriving home!I visited with my daughter and we would not hesitate in recommending Balivillas.com to families or couples. A visit here is an absolute must! It was the best holiday I have ever experienced.

<Content>Our Second Honeymoon(complete with family!) Our stay at Villa Anggrek, Nusa Dua was superb, not only the villa, but the staff too! This was really our second honeymoon, our 24th Wedding Anniversary, complete with our 17year old daughter, and 19 year old son!Right from the start at the airport, when our driver Komang met us at the airport we were impressed. He stood out from the crowd of other drivers/reps and whisked us away with a team of porters from nowhere. We were greeted at the villa by the butler Susilia and staff, and given a tour of the villa. Within two hours of arriving, after our 27 hour journey, we all had an hour long full body massage by four masseuses, Bliss!!Susilia helped us plan our activities, and all our meals. We wanted to stay entirely Indonesian, but unfortunately, when we had a meal away from the villa, and a shame, but we think it might have been the seafood restaurant at Jimbaran, I started off with a stomach bug. So in the end we ate entirely at the villa, with Italian and western food.Susilia and Komang the driver helped us plan our activities, which included Scuba diving, white water rafting, quad biking, water skiing, parasailing and elephant riding!! All firsts! Not to mention the volcano walk, horse riding, temple visiting and monkey sanctuary, and Turtle island. Action packed!!Without intruding, Komang became our guide, without whom, our holiday would have been totally flat, and he really became part of the family.We want to go back, but we also want to see some other parts of the world first, but I am sure we will be back within a few years.

<Content>Wonderful second stay with Bali villas! After a wonderful honeymoon spent at the Bali Impian Pool Suite villa, we returned this year to stay at the Dewata II villa in Seminyak with our family. A beautiful villa with five lovely bedrooms and plenty of living space, it was a very pleasant place to relax. We were looked after wonderfully by Agung, the butler, who went the extra mile to ensure our holiday went smoothly. With an excellent command of English and great management skills, we really did get everything we wanted out of our Bali holiday. The other villa staff, including the chef, also deserve special mention for the quality of the service they provide.It was rounded off with a lovely meal to celebrate a birthday and the villa staff decorated the villa beautifully for the occasion and the chef cooked an especially tasty meal!The Dewata II villa is a good choice for groups of adults as all of the bedrooms are equally nice and it is very easy to wander to Seminyak when the drivers have finished for the day. Taxis to and from Kuta for evenings out are inexpensive too.The only question in our mind is when we will return! We will use Bali Villas again as the service they provide and the standard of villas which they manage really is superb.

<Content>Loved Dewarta 1 Balivillas.com We had a truly wonderful experience with Balivillas.com.from booking on the internet until the end of our holiday. A truly blissful holiday. Our villa DEWARTA 1 was magnificent and the staff, which were fully inclusive in the price, spoilt us with their efficient, friendly service. We loved the food which was prepared, when asked, by the cook. We bought home a cook book and will try to emulate some dishes which we loved. Our driver was very good, the bus new and spotlessly cleaned every day, and he drove us safely all over the island when asked. The Butler was fantastic and so helpful with ideas for outings, food selection, dinner bookings and flight confirmations. He was so friendly, spoke english beautifully and so efficient, well done Agung we loved you and wanted you to come home with us! We did not expect our washing and ironing to be done everyday as part of the villa service and would not have taken as many clothes if we had known and we would have had more room for shopping!!! Well done everyone at BALIVILLAS.COM we loved our holiday and cannot imagine how we can beat it. Tidy,s Nankivells and Wozniaks Naracoorte SA 5271

<Content>Made It Easy Bali Villas did an outstanding job for us. Although I have been to Asia many times, this was my 1st visit to Indonesia. Bali Villas made it very easy. We stayed in two of their properties; one in Nusa Dua and the other in Ubud. Both were very nice and staffed with friendly people who introduced us to the area and helped us do what we wanted. As part of the arrangements, they provided a driver and other staff who helped us see Bali and made our stay comfortable. Bali Villas was very organized and professional. It worked out perfectly for my family and I would not hesitate to recommend them to others.

<Content>Great service, great value We booked a villa thru Balivillas.com. Service is great. They pick you up and drop you off at the airport. The well trained and friendly staff includes a butler, cook. house cleaners and gardeners as well as security. Also a car and driver for 10 hours a day!This was the third villa we have rented from them, and the experience is always on the mark.The five star resorts in Bali cost about the same or more, but don't even include breakfast! We think it is excellent value and a five star experience to boot.

<Content>Recommend BaliVillas BaliVillas definately exceded our expectations.We have never been to Bali, so we weren't sure what to expect.We loved how we were away from the hustle and bustle but still had beaches,restaurants and markets outside the Villa complex.The staff were beautiful,and the food our cook made us was delicious.The driver was priceless,we could not have enjoyed Bali as much if we didn't have our driver.We went with 2 babies and staying at the Villa is the ONLY way to travel with babies!Our favourite part of the Villa was the beautiful outdoor area and swimming pool.Highly recommend staying here if you would like to have all your needs taken care of and experience a relaxing holiday.

<Content>Relaxed and happy We spent two wonderful weeks in a Spa Water Villa. The villa was kept beautifully clean, the staff were wonderful and nothing was too much trouble. Our butler Wayan made sure all our needs were met, he was great. We ate in all the time and enjoyed the Balinese food prepared for us.Having our laundry done was a real bonus. The driver was very good and also helpful.The spa treatments were wonderful, I could do with some now!We are both past our sell by dates and have travelled extensively over the years and mostly stayed in 5* hotels. This holiday and villa lived up to everything we wanted it to be.We are going back to Bali and Balivillas in November with two friends as we were so pleased.

<Content>Had great time at Balivillas It was our second stay with Balivillas and had great time (except for the weather). Great facilities, super service and so many happy, smiling faces! The super service is probably even underrated! Spent 2 weeks in a resort in Bali North - unfortunately not with Balivillas who has properties only in the south - and could feel the difference.Appreciate now even more the service (driver, cook, cleaning and fresh food made to our wishes) we get at Balivilla.Would recomend the facility who wants to spend vacation in a beatiful facility with super service.V.Kwiecinski

<Content>Water Spa V WOW,We spent 5 days with the staff of BaliVillas at the Water Spa V.What an experience. The staff was fantastic. If the best hotels in the world could even approach this level of service they would learn something. Our butler Wayan and his staff made our stay perfect. The villa was new clean and very comfortable. Spacious beyond belief and the spa treatments included every day were first rate. The chef made incedible meals, when we ate there. The driver was friendly and all spoke english. Well done.I could think of no where else to stay in Bali.

<Content>A slice of paradise! This was one of my best holidays ever! Bali is an enchanting beautiful island, with plenty to see and do. Bali Villas is a professional, well-run company who give excellent value for money and the small touches like a glass of bubbly and a rose filled bath were very much appreciated after a gruelling flight!!. The water spa villas are of a high standard, clean, impeccably run with all comforts. The staff were exceptional and fade into the background when not required. The fact that the staff performed all required duties such as laundry, cooking and cleaning meant that the entire week was free for sightseeing and sunning. Other holidays have involved too much of the above, so this was liberating. Our driver spoke good English and taught us about everyday life in Bali, the religion and customs, which we enjoyed. He showed us quiet beaches away from the crowds, temples and markets and a Balinese house.We had gone to relax, so the two hours of complementary therapy was perfect for us. The standard here was very high and we tried massages, facials, pedicures the lot!! We highly recommend it and would return!.

<Content>Fantastic We stayed in the Impian Pool Suite in the same party as thegabbs. The accommodation was excellent and the staff were second to none. Nothing was ever too much trouble. We would have no hesitation in staying here again. As we were attending the wedding in the Impian Villa, we used the villa pool every day. My only criticism would be that there were insufficient sun beds

<Content>Best family holiday We just returned from Bali and kids are already asking when we can come back! We spent a week in Water Spa Villa (3 bedroom) and everyone loved it. Ambience of the villa, outdoor living, pool and of course villa staff made our stay very special. Having 3 kids of different ages (15, 10 and 5 years old) makes it difficult to stay at the hotels and just generally going on a family vacation, because everyone wants to do their own thing. Staying in the villa and having a driver 10 hours a day as well as having your own cook made it so much easier! Kids were happy and me and my husband loved outdoor bathtub and showers. Complimentary massage every day made sure we are totally stress-free! Highly recommended!

<Content>Superb Service provided by Balivillas.com Our family holiday was greatly enhanced by the service provided by Balivillas.com. Travelling with small children, we had concerns about whether the driver would meet us, and whether everything would run smoothly. However from the moment we were greeted at the airport by our driver and welcomed by the full quota of staff at our villa, to the co-ordination of our very early departunre, Ballivillas.com provided a most courteous and professional service.Although the list price of the accommodation may seem high, the services provided make it very good value, (especially as rates are quoted in what is currently a very weak US$). Having the driver for 10 hours a day facilitates day trips or just pootling to the beach. Having the chef buy and cook the food (which was fabulous), saved untold hours procrastinating in shops and cooking, and we didn't have to do any clearing up for the period we were there.The childrens needs were well catered for with modern carry cots and car seats, and the complementary massage for adults was very welcoming.Those seeking a totally private, undisturbed vacation, may find the presence (often unannounced) of the staff a trifle disconcerting, but in many ways it is the service of the staff that make the Balivillas.com experience so memorable.

<Content>Excellent Holiday We rented one of the smaller villas on Jimbaran Hill and from the time we got off the plane to the time we left we were treated to a top quality experience. The villa was breathtaking - clean, tidy and with a wonderful array of facilities including pool table and a full entertainment centre. Most of all the 6 staff we had (there were only 8 of us) were incredibly friendly and amazed us with their ability to remember all of our names throughout and more than willing to go massively out of their way to fulfil any requests we had of them. We'll definitely be back for more of the same! We also saw one of their other villas near Seminyak which was like something out of a movie set - amazing!

<Content>Balivillas delight After traveling around Bali for 3 weeks, I rounded out my month-long trip with a 5-night stay at a villa near Jimbaran. I had emailed Balivillas a few months in advance. They were professional and prompt. Securing the property was very easy for the dates I wanted.The villa itself was a little slice of heaven. The air-conditioned bedroom was incredibly comfortable. The modern bathroom was nicer than the one I have at home. There was a comfortable sitting area where I spent some time reading and relaxing. The pool was lovely and a wonderful way to refresh myself after sitting in the sun for a bit.As for the service, the butler was very hospitable and knowledgeable. She checked in several times a day to make sure I had everything I needed. The villa was always immaculate, thanks to a very diligent houseboy (their term, not mine). The cook was wonderful -- all meals were delicious and made to my specifications. A driver was available 10 hours a day, and mine was great -- prompt, courteous, knowledgeable about the roads and some of the sights to see.The only caveat I would include is that this particular villa is quite isolated. There is nothing within walking distance, which means residents are completely dependent on the driver to get places. This limited spontaneous outings, as the butler/concierge requested plans usually a day in advance (they were able to accommodate me when a couple of things did arise).

<Content>Terrific Service at Balivillas We just returned from spending ten glorious days at the Uluwatu Surf Villa. It's hard to imagine a more luxurious holiday. The ocean view from the property was breathtaking, and the service of the staff (butler, cook, maids, driver, and property management) was outstanding, All this more than made up for accomodations which were comfortable, but not on par with those of the Ritz-Carlton where we had stayed previously. But the value of staying in your own private villas is incomparable.. The staff anticipated every possible need, and the cook prepared absolutely superb meals. All this and complementary massages - what more could you ask? We can't wait to return!

<Content>Bali the best way! This is the second time we have stayed with Bali Villas and it won't be the last.This is how every holiday should be. From the minute you are collected from the airport the staff are fantastic. Nothing is too much trouble for them. We ate in the villa as much as possible as the food was of such high quality. On the last night the staff organised for dancers and musicians to come to the villa to perform for us. The staff went to a lot of trouble to decorate the villa and it was a magical evening.Our driver was very knowledgeable about the area and helped with our trip planning.We are already trying to decide which villa we want to stay in next time.

<Content>Villa Anggrek in Benoa We booked a this villa via the internet, which was a bit of a leap of faith. However everything worked very well. The villa was as described, nicely laid out, everythng one could want. We had been a bit concerned about booking a place not on the beach, but with the car and driver this was not a problem (10 mins from Nusa Dua beach), and in some ways actually better, and quieter. There was a private plunge pool and a larger pool shared among a group of villas (but never used except by us) at the end of the garden. We had a total of 5 staff looking after us and having the Butler in particular really added value. We asked him to check out restaurants, shops, markets, sports etc, and he did it all very efficiently, and really saved us time and effort. We did nothing but relax for 6 days; what more can you ask?

<Content>superb villas An absolute value: at one fifth the cost of a 5 star hotel or 6 star cruise ship--and 4x the accomodations and service. I would always go for a villa before anything else--and our travel involves over 150,000 miles/year with the need for staying somewhere.It is really difficult to describe how really tremendous these villa rentals are.Peter Gray MD

<Content>First Impressions always count and the one given was exemplary Being our Honeymoon, I decided to book an exclusive villa in Bali.I knew we were going to get a driver and various help during our stay, but the service we received was second to none. We were treated with the greatest respect and the reception we got upon arrival will live with us forever. The spa was filled with water and flowers a romantic setting at the best of times. The champagne was on ice as we walked into the villa.The balcony view of the see and mountains was story book. We felt at ease from that moment forward. Our own chef prepared dishes as good as, if not better than the restaurants we frequented, and at cost price.The cost of the villa was around USD350 per night, which included the services of Butler, Chef, 2 house keepers, and Driver for 10 hours. The laundry was left in the morning and folded and ready to wear by late afternoon. We also had our ironing done for creases cuased by our suitcases.The excursions and adventures we organised through Balivillas were well organised and always had our pick ups on time.Overall a very nice way to spend your honeymoon.

<Content>This is what Holidays supposed to be. After going thru the website, Balivillas.com, we decided to make a booking to find out the differences between staying in a hotel and villa. From the day we touch down we are extremely happy with all the arrangement ( the ways we wanted) to the day we left. We stay in a villa with two bedrooms at Nusu Dua. First of all, we have the butler, driver,cook and all the friendly housekeeping people serving us, a family of four. We have great plan to dine outside, howvever after the first meal prepared by our cook, especially our boys age 15 and 11 love the food so that for the rest of our stay we always have our breakfast and dinner in the villa. All you have to do is tell the cook what types of food you prefer and he is able to do something for you even it is not in their menu. To have a driver and car at your disposal is so convenient and the added advantages is that he is also our tour guide. We truly have an enjoyable 7 days stay in Bali and now we already started talking about returning, this round we will like to stay in villa with sea view.
