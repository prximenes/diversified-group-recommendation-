<Content>The odd quirks are compensated by the space and the staff... Overall I agree with the positive reviews on the site, although as I write this in the lobby of the hotel, a maid is madly spraying a horrible smelling disinfectant in the air in order to cover a sort of sewer-y smell that is wafting through the dining room and the bar. While that may sound sort of off-putting (I mean: it *is* off-putting...), that smell isn't all that unusual in the center of many European cities, and I think it bothers Americans more than the locals. The highlights of this hotel are the very, very spacious rooms, which in my experience are quite unusual, even at higher-priced hotels in Madrid. When you're here working, the airy, high-ceiling look and the space to move around is so welcome that I'll make this my first choice when I return. As someone else mentioned, the beds are quite hard, but the pillows are soft. There's an excellent selection of newspapers in the lobby --all the Spanish papers, plus the Herald Tribune, the Financial Times and even Le Monde.But the place is quirky. The smell is weird; the question of whether or not your breakfast is included in the room price is a matter for discussion each day; and my room did not have a clock or a working telephone (I'm hoping that those little oversights solve the issue of whether or not I'm paying for my breakfast). As with many hotels, the (free) wireless Internet service is best in the lobby.The staff is *very* friendly and well-meaning, and is doing their best with the phone.

<Content>Perfect hotel, modestly priced in summer Ideally situated for tourists, the hotel is a real find if you can afford it. Room rates vary greatly according to the time of the year. In august, rates start at 99 EUR plus tax - which is a really good deal, given the impeccable hotel rooms which are large and have good and very comfortable beds. The only quibble I have concerns the staff at the reception: They were professional, but not friendly. In fact, some of them did not even say hello when we entered the hotel in the evening.

<Content>Nice hotel with good breakfast! We wanted to treat ourselves to a nice and reasonably priced hotel at the end of our two weeks travel from France to Spain and decided to settle at Catalonia Las Cortes.The hotel is very short distance from the train station and it's a 15 minutes walk. However, if you have luggages, highly suggest you take the cab BUT have the hotel arrange it for you. We got out of the station and took a cab in a nearby stand and when we told the cab driver where we were going, he started mumbling and looked sort of pissed off . Since the hotel is not located on one of the main street, it was hard to park and he almost kicked us out of the cab demanding the fare on the meter PLUS surcharge saying something like too short of a trip and need to charge us more. He never got out of the car to help us with our luggage and we took our time but he started to swear (we knew since it's usually the first thing you learn in a foreign language) at us. Being we are New Yorkers, we could easily fight back without much fear, however, we let it go since we ARE in a foreign country. We decided to hold our tongue and told him to stop swearing. We told the concierge and she told us they could easily arrange a cab for us with more friendlier driver which they did for our trip to the airport. The hotel room is very spacious and clean with very comfortable bed. The breakfast is really the highlight of our days since it has a huge selection with great coffee to go with it. Just make sure you check the time since it's different between weekdays and weekends. The hotel is walking distance to a lot of places but you can take the Metro to a lot of places and it's very convenient. Madrid is really a city much like any other big city and has a huge nightlife. It's just so happened that we were there during the weekend of Blanco Noche when many of the museums in the city are opened 24 hours with free admissions and there were street performances until well into night. The local food scene is definitely one of the best in the world with many selections to chose from. We also took day trips outside of Madrid to Toledo, Saville and El Escorial which we thought were more charming than Madrid. Overall, the experience at Madrid was okay since it was just too much of a metropolis for us and missing the charm we were looking for.

<Content>Location and personal service Hotel my company was going to book was full so I chose this hotel based on location and valueIts got an excellent location, close to a nice square, with live music and good restuarants (it is about 100 metres from the square, but far enough to not have any noise issues)Excellent service from the guy on reception and the waitress, who patiently listened to any request I hadDont get me wrong, this is not a five star hotel. I asked for a quiet room and got a standard room overlooking the central stairwell. Rooms acceptable, nothing more, bed not hugely comfortable, but hey I was staying for 1 night and overall room was fine for my needs. I would probably look for a room upgrade, but on this occassion the hotels bosses were in town and must have booked the better rooms, which was a real shame......Good Ham, nice cheap wine, friendly service thoughout, excellent check in, check out, easy to get a cabIt is a small hotel, with no gym and small lobby/bar/restaurant area..... You do however have to see the main staircase - this has a huge charm in itself - like your walking into a different century - you'll know what I mean when you see itSo much better than the likes of the inpersonal Melia chain of hotels, those huge monstrosities totally impersonal, overpriced, badly located, poor service and too big to care - so this hotel made a nice refreshing change from the norm

<Content>Great Service/Best Shower This was my second stay at Catalonia Las Cortes in Madrid. The staff are very friendly. My only complaint is they were not able to help me when I had trouble accessing their wireless internet service. The room was nice and was equipped with every amenity. The shower was fabulous -- had a huge shower head with amazing water pressure. Quite a treat. I did not have time for breakfast this time but recall that last time (a few months ago) the food was good and service was outstanding.

<Content>Nice hotel Overall, it was a fine hotel. We didn't find the Madrilenos particularly warm, but when we disliked the first room they gave us (first floor with tow single beds out together) they were very accommodating and immediately gave us a nicer room on the 3rd floor. There was no noise from our room, and the room was impeccibly clean. The halls and the downstairs of the hotel have absolutely beautiful architecture. We were also very impressed with the bathroom--double showers and a tub. The TV had cable, but the English speaking CNN channel did not work as well. We never quite adjusted to Madrid time, and as a result only went to breakfast one day. It was delicious and te coffee was great. We are a married couple traveling without our children, and it was definitely worth the trip. Loved the neighborhood, too. Right around the corner from the Plaza Santa Ana, the Thyssen and the Prado and Retiro Park.

<Content>One night only It was my hope to stay at this hotel during our week in Madrid but the hotel was not available six consecutive nights. It was, however, available upon our return from Toledo so we stayed here the night before returning home.This is a beautiful hotel and we liked our pretty room but it was tight for space. I wonder if because we stayed only one night we were given a small room, 201. For one night it was fine but we could not have managed this room for six nights, there was little room for movement around the bed and very little storage. However, when the door opened to the room across the hall, 202, I couldn't help but notice how spacious it is and how absolultely stunning the room is decorated...right up to the painted ceiling--our room is very pretty but this is gorgeous.Really, the only issue with our room was the size because otherwise the furnishings and details were pretty, the room was clean and quiet, the bathroom large and user friendly. Also of note, our room appeared to be the only interior-view (courtyard)room with a terrace which really was nice to have, if only for one night.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and the location of this hotel is terrific. We would stay here again....requesting a larger room....202!

<Content>Great 3 Star not a 4 Star Hotel This is a great 3 star hotel. It can not be a 4 star because if you walk down the hill to the Westin Palace that is a 5 star just one better and thus this is not a 4. It is a good three star and if you get the price of a 3 you have a great find. The issues are the total package. There is no lobby. The restaurant is an after thought in a town known for great food. A $20+ breakfast is basically a standard bacon sausage and amenitites buffet kept warm too long. The diunners are basic. The room choices vary from the magnificent 202 to a literal dungeon 03. I am not kidding a dungeon is a room with no real windows and it is dark all the time and it at the lowest point in the hotel thus room 03. So the ability to predict a great experience is based on what is available. If you are flying here from the USA you had better insist on a certain type of room as all of the good ones are gone by 1800.What makes it a great 3 star is the cleanliness, the location, walk to the Thyssen, the Prado the Archeologie Museos, the Botanical Gardens or the park. A quick tube stop to almost anywhere else. The bathrooms are all in marble and the floors are wood which is nice unless the person above you walks around in heals which then drives you crazy. The people are nice and helpful and the internet is free. So it is a great 3 star. There are no amenities other than the internet, so if you need a place to sleep and get a good rate and a nice choice of rooms you will feel like you are in heaven. If anyone of those does not happen you will feel sort of put off and if two do not happen you will wonder who those people are that wrote those glowing reviews.Jim

<Content>Great location, fab shower/bathroom! Stayed here over Easter, sharing a twin room with a friend. Good sized comfortable room; great bathroom with bath and separate huge shower! Great location close to lots of bars and restaurants; close to shopping and the museums. Receptionist was very helpful and kindly let me practice my spanish and spoke slowly and clearly for me;) Only downside was at at breakfast; we arrived quite late one day (we hadn't prepaid) and were seated for about 5 minutes before the waiters cleared away all the food from the buffet! 11 finish is pretty prompt; would have been nice to be advised of this before we sat down at 10.55. But in the overall context it wasn't major, we didn't complain at the time and it wouldn't stop me staying there again!

<Content>Wonderful experience This hotel was wonderful. There were four of us in a triple room on the first floor. A triple room were 2 larger twin beds and one twin. The room (103) was spacious and clean. We had two terraces, tiny ones, but nevertheless two. One in the bathroom and one in the bedroom. Gorgeous bathroom, very large and clean. Outside the room was a beautiful hallway with couches and tables where we would go and have some wine, and just chit chat about the day. Staff were very nice and were very helpful in getting us reservations for a Flemenco restaurant, taxi cab to the airport and train directions to Segovia. It was situated a couple of blocks from Santa Anna, not far from Plaza de Mayor and within walking distance to the Prado, Reina Sofia and other major sites. I would recommend this hotel very highly. Great experience and great location. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel Near To Everything I stayed in ths hotel for 4 nights in January and although it was quiet because of the time of year, I would highly recommend it. The rooms were clean and spacious and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Is located quite centrally and you can walk everywhere with the help of a map from the desk, which the staff will help you with.

<Content>Difficult to meet high expectations We booked this hotel soley based on the Trip Advisor recommendations. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here but did not leave bowled over. The problem is that you arrive with very high expectations. These were definitely met in term of the location and the room.The room was really beautiful and comfortable - top marks. Apart from our room the rest of the hotel was nothing to get excited about. Rather uninteresting lobby and bar. Fantastic location. In just the right place.

<Content>Excellent choice I booked the Catalonia based on Trip Advisor reviews and was not disappointed. We stayed only one night at the end of a trip to southern Spain and Portugal, so I looked for a comfortable, well located hotel. The Catalonia Las Cortes more than met those expectations. The desk staff spoke excellent English and was young and genuinely friendly. The room was beautiful, with one of the nicest walk-in showers I have ever seen. My wife's only complaint was that there was only one small window and it was high up the wall and she said it made her feel a little claustrophobic. But the room was large, clean and comfortable. I noticed that prices have gone up- probably due to the current worthless U.S. dollar! So I wouldn't call the hotel a great value, but it is an excellent hotel.

<Content>Great Location and a good hotel On our trip to Madrid in September 2007, we picked the Catalonia Las Cortes based on the glowing Trip Advisor reviews. For the most part, we were not disappointed. The hotel could not be in a better location, walking distance from the Prado and the Thyssen, It is also very close to the Plaza Santa Ana with its great restaurants. and entertaing night life. An added plus we discovered, was the Cafe Central Jazz Club and the Casa Patas Flamenco Cafe, both within two blocks of the hotel.The hotel was very clean and beautifully decorated. The complimentary breakfast was excellent. We did experience one minor problem which should have been easily remedied. The wash basin in the bathroom did not drain properly. It took four days and a personal visit to the hotel manager to finally have repairs , which took five minutes, made. Also, we did not find the desk staff to be very knowledgable or helpful.Bottom line, however,if we are ever in Madrid again, we will stay at the Las Cortes,

<Content>Great Location Great location! We had easy walks to several art museums, including the Prado, the Palace, and several good restaurants. The Cuban restaurant, El Tocororo, is merely steps away from the front door. The staff were friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Rooms were very clean, with excellent bathrooms. They had a lounge area and a restaurant downstairs which provided a full breakfast. I would recommend this hotel strongly.

<Content>Loced Las Cortes Catalonia Las Cortes is in a great location--10 minutes' walk to the Prado and Thyssen museams, 15 minutes to the Queen Sofia museam, and 2 minutes to Plaza Sanata Ana (with tons of tatpas bars.) Pros:--the most helpful front desk team (especailly Cesar and Luka) I have encountered in Spain--wonderful linens, towel warmer, and huge marbel showers with dual showerheads--small balconies with French doors (double windows for noise control)--room thermostats which really work well--great location (see above)--good buffet breakfast with cheeses, meats, spanish tortillas, bread/patries, juices, yogurtCons:--despite double-glazing, street noise is an issue on weekends (can last until 4:00am)--design is more grandma-chintz than cool minimalist--it costs 2 Euro for 10 minutes on the lobby computer

<Content>Excellent facility and location We stayed at the Villa Real up the street in a smaller room for more money and all we got there was slightly better style (and clientele) but you can't fold that! This is an excellent deal in an excellent location. Marble baths and tub, ultimate convenience and comfort for an extremely reasonable price in the best district in town. Superlative.

<Content>Perfect Stay We would return to this hotel without hesitation. Our room was on the second floor; a corner room with two large windows -- and a large comfortable Queen size bed. The modern marble bathroom was spacious as hotel baths go, and the shower pressure was terrific with plenty of hot water. The staff went out of their way to accommodate us. The breakfast was included in the rate, and provided an excellent variety from fruit through eggs, sausage, potato tortillas, etc. I asked for tea, two mornings, and they brought an individual tea pot to the table. As other reviews stated, you can't beat the location. We walked to the Prado, and Retiro Park and felt safe walking at night beyond Santa Ana Square, through the streets and other Squares in the Old Madrid area. The tapas bars were lively at night, and a fun scene. We booked very early, and got an excellent value. Our four nights rate was $255. USD per night including tax. We considered it a bargain, given the quality of our stay and the location.

<Content>Great location but some problems. After reading all the reviews I was really looking forward to my 5-day stay but was disappointed. Many reviewers stayed in rooms with stained glass and frescoes on the ceiling. That was not what I had on the top floor. While the room was spacious there was a tiny window too high to see out of and covered by a drape in need of repair. The breakfast was great with a good selection but you had a sense that staff was watching you to be sure you didn't go back too many times. Witnessed an argument between staff and someone who wanted a capuccino rather than the poor coffee that was available. All in all the staff were efficient but not very friendly. The location was excellent however, Just off the Plaza Santa Ana with all of its Tapas bars and action, yet far enough away re: noise. It was also a short walk to the Prado and Thyssen Museums. All in all it was OK but I had a better stay two weeks earlier at the Preciados for a better price even considering the included breakfast at Las Cortes.

<Content>Very Costly for 3-Star Accommodation - Great Location Unfortunately for us, we selected this hotel based upon Trip Advisor reviews. We paid close to $500/night for this centrally located hotel... near the Prado and Thiessen museums as well as near the shopping areas. We paid dearly for location, location, but got less than a Hampton Inn quality room. The room itself was quite small and the dirty wooden floors necessitated a call to Reception for cleaning. The water pressure in the shower was very strong. The staff was friendly, but not well-informed in making restaurant suggestions or giving directions. The included breakfasts were fine. Bottom line is that we had stayed the previous nights at the EXQUISITELY MAGNIFICENT 5-Star Hilton Buenavista in Toledo (1/2 hr train ride from Madrid) at $225/night. If we had it to do over, we would have stayed in the 5-Star hotel for less than half the price and commuted. Knowing the quality of the Westin chain, if I wanted to stay near the Prado, I'd pay $675/n at the nearby Westin Palace vs the $500/n at the Catalonia. If you can get a deal at the Catalonia for less than $300/n... then take it and wear slippers. After staying at the Catalonia, I will be much more wary of the Trip Advisor reviews.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed at this lovely hotel for a long weekend having seen all the reviews. The hotel location is excellent and very central. The rooms are great and the shower is of the type you would expect in a 5 star hotel. The staff were very helpful and the breakfast had lots of choice and was always of a good standard. Just down the road is Plaza de Santa Ana. where there are plenty of Tapas bars. Cannot think of anything negative to say about this Hotel and would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Very good hotel Stayed at hotel CLC for 2 nights in Sept , very comfy , great location, elegant decor, great staff who spoke perfect English. A little overpriced, but if money is not a problem highley recommended. Spent the next 5 nights at the Hotel Liabeny about 10 minutes walk towards Puerta del Sol, in my opinion this hotel was just as good ( a little older maybe) and half the price at 130 Euros per night with buffet brekky, that is the go if you want to save some bucks. Liabeny is on Calle Sud of Puerta Del Sol.

<Content>Great Hotel This is a really great hotel. The location is fabulous, located at Plaza Santa Ana, almost equal walking distance between Plaza Mayor and the Prado Museum, about 10 minutes or so each way. The rooms are elegant, the bathrooms terrific. We had a deluxe room which was very large but a bit expensive. My guess is that the standard rooms are smaller. The staff was great, made every effort to help and spoke English as well as they could. Cesar was particularly helpful. The hotel stored our excess luggage for us at no cost for five nights between our stays there. We were there a total of six nights and plan to return. I thought the breakfast was very nice as well. My only concern is that the bed was the hardest we experienced in Spain. That could be an issue for some travelers.

<Content>Great spot altogether! This hotel was great. The location is perfect. There are loads of bars and tapas restaurants nearby. The staff were very helpful and very polite. The breakfast is worth getting up for and is served till 1030. The rooms are very nice and well air conditioned, as are the hallways etc. I thought it was little on the pricey side but i think it is the norm in madrid.. The streets around the hotel are noisy but it did not to carry in to the rooms. I recommend this hotel very highly. It is within walking distance of practically every attraction.. C.Carroll.. Cork

<Content>Great place to stay I chose this hotel because of the excellent reviews I had read. I wasn't at all disappointed in my room which not only had a large bedroom and shower room (with 2 showers!) but also had a separate hallway with wardrobe and personal safe. The room was very clean and comfortable. The only downside was that it looked on to an inner courtyard and so there was very little natural light. The staff were very pleasant but few spoke English. I ate in the hotel restaurant on two occasions because I was in Madrid on my own. The food was quite poor - not well cooked and not particularly good quality. I got the impression dining in the restaurant wasn't encouraged as it was very quiet. The breakfast buffet was fine with a good range of hot and cold foods. The location of the hotel is excellent, quiet but central, close to the museums and galleries. I would definitely stay here again but I would eat out!

<Content>Wonderful hotel in a perfect location We stayed here for 3 nights in mid-September 2007. We liked everything about this place. Our room was smartly appointed and large enough for 2 travelers with separate luggage. Our bath had a free standing shower and a tub/shower combo which was a plus. We booked a standard double room at 162 euros which included breakfast; the rooms had 2 twin beds, a desk, separate entry room, flat screen TV and 2 closets. This hotel doesn't offer a view but it is so conveniently located just between Plaza Santa Ana and the Prado Museum that you are literally within minutes of many of the major attractions.We had drinks almost nightly in one of the many cafe/bars in Plaza Santa Ana. Also, just 1 minute from the hotel are 2 self-service laundries. I can definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who counts cleanliness, nice beds  pillows, location and price as important factors when choosing a hotel.

<Content>Nothing special My wife and I chose to stay at the Catalonia Las Cortes mainly becuase of its excellent reviews and ratings on TripAdvisor which we have usually found quite dependable in the past. Unfortunately we found the hotel to be quite an ordinairy 4 star. The staff were OK; the breakfast was OK; the bedroom was OK; the location was OK. We ate just once in the hotel's own restaurant and that was quite a let down given the price. The food was obviously from some pre-prepared system such as cook/freeze and whist edible was not an occasion to savour. We noticed that throughout our six nights there the hotel restaurant was hardly used in the evenings by any of the guests.So the whole experience was OK but nothing more. We have stayed in far better 4 star hotels on visits to Spanish cities.Would we sta there again? No. Would we recommend anyone else to stay? We'd say it's 'OK' but there must be somewhere better for the same money.

<Content>Not Disappointed Booked this hotel on basis of Trip Advisor Reviews and were not disappointed. The room price which included breakfast was great value for Madrid particularly in this very central location. The room was spacious and extremely clean-a bonus was the free in room wifi (only expected it in the public areas). The service was very good at all times, the staff at reception spoke excellent English and were eager to be helpful, and the breakfast was more than adequate and very well presented. Have stayed previously in 4 other Hotels in Madrid-next time will be coming back to this Hotel.

<Content>Hidden Gem Review by James HolwayA four star hotel that is well worth its four stars.A perfect location. The lively tapas bars of the Plaza Santa Ana and Calle Principe are a 2 minute walk. The sights of the Puerta del Sol and Plaza Major about a 3 minute stroll and ' The Golden Triangle' of Museums (Prado, Thyssen and Reina Sofia) about a 10 minute.The room was spacious, clean and well appointed with wooden floors and a marble bathroom. Would happily recommend it and stay here again.

<Content>Brilliant location I booked directly with the hotel having read all the reviews on the site. Other websites were much more expensive - the day before we travelled however it was much cheaper on Expedia!We took a taxi from the airport, it was hot and we didn't feel like battling our way on the metro. It cost 30Euro. We had booked 3 rooms, the keys didn't work in one room and another was tiny. Both problems were dealt with efficiently. Rooms are spacious and comfortable and bathrooms are great. My only gripe was there seemed to be a definite staff shortage - breakfast service was erratic - I had to ask several times for coffee and I noticed other guests becoming slightly annoyed by this too. The day we checked out there was a 40 minute wait to check out - one member of staff attending to everyone's needs was not enough.Lots of lovely places to eat and drink and watch the world go by. Had one bad experience where the waiter offered to bring tapas for 7 - what followed was a banquet that he knew we could not possibly eat! I was very annoyed and he finally reduced the bill, slightly! The Room Mate hotel next door had a fantastic restaurant serving a set menu tapas lunch. We ordered the one for 3 and had more than enough food. Maybe we are just small eaters. Bus tour to be recommended and good value for money.

<Content>Perfect location, very relaxing stay We picked Las Cortes based on its tripadvisor rating/reviews and were not disappointed! The staff were lovely, the breakfast was great (served until 11am on weekends!) and the room and bathroom were spacious and spotless. The mini cafe inside the hotel lobby was a nice bonus!The hotel is 30 seconds from one of the main squares which has some nice outdoor cafe/restaurants, also very close to the art galleries (Reina Sofia within walking distance down the hill) and the Anton Martin metro stop. Everything we wanted to see/do was within 2-3 metro stops, so very convenient.If you're looking for cutting edge decor the Room Mate Alicia might be for you - we walked by it on several occasions as it is close by Las Cortes and the lobby features some interesting art! But if you're happy with traditional elegance, we'd definitely recommend Las Cortes for a relaxing and charming stay.

<Content>Great Hotel! Beautiful hotel with an excellent location. I was really impressed both with the staff and the room itself: far beyond my expectations. The hotel staff spoke English and were eager to offer help and advise on everything from late night dinner, taxis to the airport, and electrical converters. I want to visit again!

<Content>Great Hotel In Madrid Great hotel in City Centre, just down the road from one of many Plazas. Very clean, neat and tidy room, and a fantastic bathroom, all for a very reasonable rate. Staff were very friendly and accomodating, and definitley worth getting breakfast included in the rate - superb.Great location from which to explore Madrid, without having to rely on Taxis - Plaza Mayor only 10 minute walk away.Would highly recommend this hotel, and would definitely stay there again if in Madrid - couldn't fault anything.

<Content>Beautiful hotel, great location We stayed at Hotel Catalonia Las Cortes for 2 nights and found it absolutely great. We found it a little difficult to find at first seeing as it about a 10 min walk from Sol Metro and you have to take quite a few turns to find it. The reception area is probably the least impressive thing about hotel. It's perfectly fine and functional and I would have no complaints about it. But for such a wonderful hotel the reception area does not do it justice seeing as it is just average. I would not count this as a fault though. Our check in was perfect. The staff throughout our stay were very friendly and helpful. The room itself was beautiful. A nice mix of old and new. The building is a converted palace evidently. Some of the rooms (not ours) have the original painted ceilings. The bed was big and comfortable and the bathroom was spotless, classy and had a lovely powerful shower. The air-con (unlike many other hotels I've stayed in in Spain) actually worked perfectly and made sleeping very comfortable at night. The location of the hotel is only a few steps from Plaza St. Anna which is the main square for eating out and is surrounded by restaurants, bars and cafes where you can get some amazing food for good prices.All in all a lovely stay at Catalonia Las Cortes. No complaints at all. Rooms are lovely and quiet too. Because you have two sets of doors to the room balcony any street noise outside is totally blocked out.

<Content>terrific three days Having just returned from three hectic but very enjoyable days in Madrid; sampled the foof, watched the dancing, listened to and clapped along with the musicians, visited most of the breath taking fountains and spent a day up in the mountains in the towns of Avila and Sejovia. Enjoyed every second and can certainly recommend staying at the Catalonia Las Cortes; scruptiously clean everywhere, terrific room, welcoming staff, brilliant breakfasts. We would certainly recommend this hotel to all ages. Situated within easy access of many sites and close to Metro. Our first taste of Spain but definitely not our last. Thank you Expedia and staff at Las Cortes. The Zawodniaks

<Content>As Good As It Gets This is the sort of hotel we usually walk past enviously on our way to some lower standard accommodation. Everything from the impressive reception area with helpful staff to the immaculate rooms is from the top drawer. Our first floor room opened onto the narrow lane behind the hotel but we weren't disturbed and enjoyed a very restful night on the satisfyingly firm and enormous bed.Breakfast was among the best we've had at a hotel with plenty of choice and the perfect start to a day exploring the nearby Prado and Thyssen-Bornemisza galleries.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay here. Stayed here in July which is one of the hottest months for a visit to Madrid. It was gloriously sunny everyday and very hot.Had a fantastic deal with Expedia, which could not be bettered by other travel agents etc.The hotel has a good location on the edge of the Old Town and the Bourbon area of the city. The major museums - Prado and Thyssen are very close and within close walking distance. In the evening the area around the hotel comes alive and there is a wide choice of good places to eat and drink. Having said that the hotel is quiet and just far enough away from the Plaza de Santa Ana.The hotel is a good 4 star. The room was quite well appointed with a good sized bathroom. The breakfast was included in our room rate and was very good. The staff at the hotel were pleasant and helpful.I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Madrid and would probably return myself on another trip to the city.

<Content>Catalonia did not dissapoint This is indeed a very nice little hotel in the center of Madrid with excellent location, nice rooms,very good included breakfast, nice bar area with great drinks and overall good value for your money.I would go without hesitation. If you go, you should try the little cuban restaurant across the street,Tocororo.It is very good. Try for starters the tostones rellenos con picadillo and croquetas; then go for la vaca frita con arroz blanco y frijoles negros or la ropa vieja.Enjoy.

<Content>Great Experience A terrific value! The room was very well appointed and quiet, the bathrooms spacious and luxurious (both a bath and two-person shower in Room 309), free wi-fi in the room, steps from Plza Santa Ana and other nightlife, as well as a great location for seeing Madrid's famous museums! For a hotel of such a relatively small size, there is a suprising number of tastefully-restored interior spaces (check out the stairwells). A near-perfect stay.A few tips:1) I was only able to book a room with two double beds via the online hotels reservation website I used. When I checked in, I asked for a room with a single queen bed for me and my wife, which they had.2) I asked for a second room key so that I could keep the AC on (you need to have the key in a slot by the door for this to work), so that I could come back to a cool room after a day walking around the city. A small detail, but worth asking for if you are visiting in the summer.

<Content>perfect hotel, perfect location in Madrid What a perfect spot in Madrid; the room was beautiful; fresh paint, draperies and bedspread (a beautiful taupe color). A wonderful buffet breakfast was included in our booking and it was a good thing since our day was filled with things to do and see, steps away. You are close to Santa Ana square and all major sites in Madrid. The staff was not only delightful, but helpful with directions, dining, and even shopping. Maybe you can spend more $$$ in Madrid, but why when the Catalonia Las Cortes is waiting for you!p.s yes, the bed is firm, but during 10 days in Spain and Portugal all were very firm.

<Content>Great Location - Wonderful people - Best Bathroom This hotel is wonderfully located in Plaza de Santa Anna, which is a big square with lots of restaurants w/outside seating, tapas bars and cervezerias. It is a 5 minute walk to Plaza Mayor and the Prada Museum. Best location in Madrid.The staff was very friendly and helpful. When I asked for a power coneverter for my laptop, the receptionist couldn't find one right away, and offered to bring me his own power adapter fro his mac at home! But he didn't give up and found a converter 5 minutes later. That's service!The room was small, but we had a king sized bed, and a great bathroom with a large separate shower (there was a nice bath).I will now recomend this hotel to any of my friends who tell me they are going to Madrid, specially for the first time.

<Content>Catalonia Las Cortes -- Fantastico! This was one of the nicest hotel rooms we have ever enjoyed. The bedroom was huge (roughly 26 x 16 feet!) and beautifully appointed, and the bathroom was elegantly trimmed in green marble. The staff was very helpful, and the location was perfect -- just steps from numerous great restaurants and bars. And, at 167 euros, it was a fantadtic bargain as well. A terrific place.

<Content>Everything We Hoped For! My family and I had a 24-hour layover in Madrid. We wanted a chance to see the city, with a restful night's sleep. We were very surprised by the excellence of the hotel. For the price $260, we had just that. The location is excellent-within walking distance to everything you'd want to see. The hotel is on the smaller side, so it has an intimate feel. The concierge was incredibly helpful on a number of different things, including suggestions for restaurants and tours. The rooms were very comfortable, and bathrooms amazing. And, especially for Americans used to larger breakfasts, the free breakfast buffet was very satisfactory. I would highly recommend this hotel for any and all travelers.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! This a great hotel, perfect location, close to everything you need to see and do. We were given an upgrade as our room door was faulty, there was no hesitation, we were upgraded immediately, on the fourth floor in a superior room. Massive bed, lots of space and stylish decor. It was 5 star standard. The bathroom was wonderful, lots of green marble and good fittings. The staff were more than helpful, telling us about bars, booking resaurants and always helpful and friendly. I can't fault this hotel and if you're travelling to Madrid give it a try, you wont be dissapointed. Madrid is a great city, we can't wait to go back!

<Content>Great stay in Madrid Just returned from three nights at the Catalonia Las Cortes. We had flight problems and arrived at the hotel at 3:00 am. I was worried there might be a problem with our room since we had requested 3 beds but everything was fine. The room was very spacious even with a king size bed and an extra bed. The bathroom was huge with a walkin shower bigger than most closets. The staff was extremely helpful at all times. The little downstairs bar area was a nice place to relax after sightseeing. The location was great-less than five minutes to the Prado and other museums. Plenty of cozy restaurants in the neighborhood. We had a very nice, inexpensive dinner at a place called Root. Also enjoyed flamenco at Casa Patas which was also nearby. Breakfast was included in our price. It was not exceptional but more than adequate to get the day started. Our only complaint would be the mattress. It was hard and not very comfortable. However, for the price we found the Catalonia to be very acceptable and would definitely return in the future.

<Content>Great Hotel  We, (a group of 40 something ladies) stayed at the Catalonia Las Cortes in May 2007 to celebrate one of our friends' BIG birthday. I booked this hotel after failing to secure a reservation for the Gran Canarias, and we were not disappointed. I had researched the Las Cortes on trip advisor and found the reports to be very accurate.  The trip from the airport took about 20-30 minutes depending on the taxi driver. It would appear that they all model themselves on Schummacher! Don't sit in the front seat if you are of a nervous disposition. The meter was running, but at the end of the trip this was adjusted. For 3 or 4 in a cab it seems that the going rate is éˆ§?0, which is not too bad considering the entertainment en route! On arrival at the hotel, check-in was relatively painless once the two young men on reception worked out the room permutations. We booked the standard rooms, of which there were slight variations. Ask for a room overlooking the courtyard as they are slightly bigger and probably quieter. The rooms are on the small side compared to some other European cities but have very comfy beds, nice marble bathrooms, all the usual toiletries and a good hairdryer (you did need a strong thumb though!).Breakfast was included which was good with a selection of cooked, healthy i.e fresh fruits, juices and muesli and also cold meats, cheeses and even chocolate cake! The hotel is in an ideal location for most of the main tourist attractions, i.e. Palacio Real, Plaza Major, Puerta Del Sol, Prado (closed Mondays, free entry Sundays but large queue) Thyssen, El Rastro  Retiro Park. All were within easy walking distance. The Plaza St Ana is a 2 minute stroll up the street and is a great place to spend time over a jug of sangria or tapas in the evening. It does get very busy Fri/Sat with tables at a premium, so going out early i.e. before 10 pm is a good idea. We ate just off the square at La Fragua De Vulcano. Good raciones (large tapas) but the music is a bit on the loud side. Vinoteca Bibicheria in Pl. St. Ana is a good tapas bar/restaurant but as you can't book, finding a table at the weekend is hard. Think the favourite place had to be El Buschon 5 minutes north east of Pl.St. Ana. Excellent pork and meatballs. Everything is in Spanish but half the fun is decifering the menu  guesswork! It was all good. We enjoyed Madrid very much with the location and standard of the hotel adding to this greatly. I would recommend the Las Cortes as an ideal base for a Madrid stay.

<Content>Aboslutely wonderful Had two double rooms there in February at the exceptionally low weekendrate 99 euros, including breakfast (hot buffet with a fine choice of food, even freshly pressed orange juice.) The rooms were among the finest I've ever had, and everything was top standard. The only exception was the people in the reception, who were in dire need of a course in how to treat their guests with a smile. Not that one should a minor negative factor like that ruin the overall satisfaction of staying in such central and high-standard accomodations at such a low price in Madrid. The Santa Ana Plaza is right around the corner, with Cafe Central, one of the few good music places in Madrid, frequently featuring high quality jazz and tango ensembles. Right down the narrow pedestrianized street Huertas, from Plaza Santa Ana in the direction of the Prado, there is another jazz bar, Populart. A few blocks further down the Huertas and turn left at Calle Jesus, there is a wonderful restaurant in no 2, La Rabana. Really a gem, with high quality food at very medium prices, and with a very good house wine. They don't open until 9 pm, but this should be no problem, since the famous tapas bar Los Gatos, is next door. A racion jamon ibero there is really a treat, though it doesn't come cheap.

<Content>Great place to stay! Party of 8 have just spent 4 nights in this wonderful hotel celebrating a 60th birthday. Tastefully refurbished and spotlessly clean. Plenty of food for beakfast. Staff extremely helpful and friendly. Would stay at this hotel again if in Madrid as it is in walking distance of a metro station and old town attractions.

<Content>Little Gem and close to all you want to see in Madrid This is wonderful hotel-finished to a high standard. If you don't want to stay in a hi tech hotel (of which there are many in Madrid) and prefer a bit of old Spain - stay here.! The rooms are very comfortable with a beautifully done separate bathroom. Ours had a walk in shower room- very luxurious for a 4 star and air conditioning- which we did need in Feb as hotel was a bit too hot for us.This hotel is surrounded by great little bars and resturants- stay off Santa Ana for value and is walking distance to all the other major points of interest.(musems, Sol,La Latina, Plaza Mayor,Palacio Real, Gran Via)). We didn't get the metro once.Madrid is fabulous and I hope to return when the weather is warmer. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes a bit of style and comfort. The value was brillant- room BB per night was 99euro- a bargain. I've don't have any photos but I would say that the hotel web site photos do not do this Hotel justice. Also this is a safer area than say- Sol and the Gran Via-where I saw an attempt at pic-pocketing etc at night time.Be careful where you stay in this city. We're glad we stayed on Calle del Prado at this hotel and will stay here again!!
