<Content>Comfortable, Convenient, Full Service Hotel in a Great Location We booked and stayed in two double rooms (6 persons) at the Maria Cristina for the week following Christmas into the New Year. The practical rooms were comfortable and very clean, the staff friendly and helpful from top to bottom and the restaurant an excellent value. The concierge and other services were easy, useful and convenient. The location is safe and somewhat central. Each morning, after we left for sight seeing, the rooms were made up and 3 new bottles of water we left for us. Often, we encountered the cleaning staff in the hall and they made it clear (despite language barriers) they wanted to do the best job possible and wanted us to be totally satisfied with our stay. Half way through the stay, we had our laundry cleaned. It was done very well with small details attended to and all for a very fair price.Four times during our stay we ate in the restaurant - twice for breakfast and twice for dinner. The food was good (better than at least three other restaurants we ate in,) and the service exceptional. The waiters were friendly, tolerant of our broken Spanish, efficient and helpful. It was a comfortable restaurant and it offered a sizable, typical, and satisfying menu.The hotel offered a full range of services - which we employed during our stay - from concierge to hairstyling. Twice we asked for help arranging tours and were offered very reasonably priced and excellent private tours. We accepted both: one to Teotihuacan and one to Xochimilco. The former cost about $20 a person, the latter about $15 and both were complete, educational, comfortable and fun. On other occasions we asked for recommendations about restaurants, taxi rides and directions. Each time someone someone speaking English was able to help with advice, calls or specific directions. It should also be noted that I took advantage of the hair styling services and received a hair cut as good as any I have received in the US.The Maria Cristina is located in a good area. It is safe, has plenty of caf茅s, small stores and restaurants close by and sits one block for the Reforma (a large and elegant boulevard.) where there are even more conveniences. In addition, the hotel has a beautiful courtyard, comfortable lobby and fun bar for a little post touring relaxation.When it was time to leave the Maria Cristina, We were a little sad to be leaving a place where everyone was friendly and helpful and where we had become so comfortable. I am certain that next time we return to Mexico City, the Maria Cristina is the first place we will look into.

<Content>Not so great The hotel entrance is pretty, but other than that is it is a standard mid level hotel. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the metro and is located in a safe area. Most restaurants in the area are International chains. There are a few good bars in the area. The rooms were good sized, but not very clean. There were stains and hair on the bedspread. Wireless internet access is pretty expensive. Overall, for the money we paid it was a decent deal.

<Content>Modern hotel in good location. We didn't notice much of the colonial charm mentioned in other reviews, but the Maria Cristina is certainly a very clean and efficient modern hotel in a safe area near the Zona Rosa.Rooms were of the standard European/American travellers would expect, and would be suitable for business as well as leisure travellers. The staff spoke English and were very helpful with providing maps etc, and a broken hairdryer was fixed the same day as reported.There is a lovely garden by reception.There are computers with internet access by reception; you have to pay to use these but they are fairly cheap.We travelled by one of the official taxis from the airport and had no difficulties as the driver recognised the name of the hotel.

<Content>Very nice traditional hotel - great location I just returned from a short week stay at the Maria Cristina Hotel 鈥?my 3rd short visit in about as many years.It remains an excellent mid-level (not expensive) downtown choice. Great location 鈥?easy quick walking distance to the Zona Rosa across the Reforma Ave, but quiet and in a safe location. Long walk possible either to the old center or the Museum/park area (maybe half an hour each direction to the Anthropology Museum and to the Zocalo in the opposite direction, or easy public transit or taxi). The Zona Rosa is getting abit tacky in places but remains safe, with loads of restaurants and bars around (along with some good stores). There are several 7-11 type stores (oxxo鈥? nearby for yogurt, extra water鈥? along with several seemingly nice small eateries. The US and UK embassies are both fairly nearby (easy 5 min walk away).The hotel is clean, quiet, with a very nice bar and garden, and also a restaurant 鈥?good breakfasts though the coffee was not the best (but you can buy good coffee several places nearby). I believe that there are two levels of rooms 鈥?the smaller traditional ones (fine 鈥?I was there last time around) and the larger two-double or queen bed ones (which I had this time). The staff are excellent and the front desk speaks good English. Rooms include good shower/bath, nice TVs (not digital) and a good range of cable, phone, small fridge and an included electronic safe. No alarm clock or radio though (but the front desk is good for wake-up calls). Internet is available at a cost 鈥?you need to pay the front desk to use one of the 3 computers on the ground floor.I will probably be back in Mexico City next year and, if possible, will be back at the same hotel again 鈥?it is a very good choice for the price and location.

<Content>Charming hotel I stayed at this hotel five nights in July and found it surpassed three and even four star hotels in Europe and US. The lobby and restaurant decor is old-fashioned, but that's part of the charm. The internal corridors and stairwells are tiled in Mexican tiles, and the restaurant and lobby open onto a courtyard garden (this is in addition to the beautiful garden to one side of the hotel). I booked a Deluxe room, which was reasonably spacious with a clean, recently re-fitted bathroom. There was wireless internet access and I found it to be fast and reliable - if somewhat expensive.The hotel is quiet (apart from annoying piped music in the garden), very cheap for what it offers, and the staff are helpful and friendly. I would definitely stay here again in preference to a larger chain hotel.

<Content>Great hotel near Zona Rosa After reading reviews on this website, we decided to stay at this hotel, and we weren't disappointed. The room was clean and tidy and overlooked the garden. No street noise, and generally very peaceful. Lovely foyer area and spiral staircase to the rooms (if you didn't want to take the lift!). Bottled water left in rooms each day. Our room didn't have AC, but we had a fan (although it could have done with being oiled!). In an ideal world it would have been nice to have had a small fridge in the room. The staff were very helpful and bilingual. There are 3 computers for interest access in the foyers. We only tried the restaurant a couple of times. Seemed fine, but nothing special. There is a small Oxxo store a few doors down. The hotel is a block from Paseo de la Raforma, which is a beautiful road with creative sculptures. There is a brand new mall 3 mins walk away, which has restaurants, shops and a cinema. Alternatively, there are other restaurants nearby.Great place to stay.

<Content>A great value I'll add to the many positive reviews of this hotel. Great location: One block from Paseo de la Reforma and three to the Angel and Sanborns. Rio Lerma has vey little traffic in front of the hotel and there is hardly any audible street noise. My non-smoking deluxe room with a view to the garden was large as was the bathroom and both were very clean. May is traditionally the warmest month in the D.F. and the AC functioned well. Two bottles of water were left daily and there was no charge. The chain hotels charge 20 pesos or more.The garden is a real plus to relax in with a drink or coffee.There is an OXXO market (7-11 type) one block away and the hotel is next door to the V. Carranza museum if you know your Mexican Revolutionary history- interesting if you don't.The three Internet computers were rather slow. The staff is friendly and the housekeeping was excellent. Staying here is a real value.

<Content>A Great Bargain Based on the recommendations of reviewers on Trip Advisor, my dad and I decided to reserve a room for one week at the Maria Cristina. The room was quite comfortable, and the air conditioning was a blessing. The staff was very helpful, and the restaurant was decent and very convenient. The grounds are peaceful and quite lovely. Internet is available for a really reasonable cost. Taxis are available right outside the hotel at all times. They are priced fairly and clean, and the drivers are courteous and helpful. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone unless you want something luxurious. If so, stay at one of the big chains and maybe you'll think you're still in the U.S.

<Content>Independent oasis, not for big chain lovers The hotel was a recommendation from a friend.The hotel is a little hotel in the middle of the city, with a beautiful garden and a lot of tranquility.It is an independet hotel , so for big chain lovers might not be their cup of tea.For me is perfect, more personal treatment, like a family run hotel.

<Content>Deserves another .5 stars! HMC is easily equivalent to a US 3.5 star hotel. The property is very nice and I wouldn't entirely agree with the uninteresting rooms description in some other reviews. Yes, they don't have a lot of character, but they're solid and clean with nice amenities. It might get pretty rough in summer, though, as I didn't see an AC unit in ours. The location and grounds are nice and the staff was very friendly. It's not the type of place I'd go for an extended DF stay, but it's quite nice for a night or two if you're entering/leaving DF.

<Content>Good hotel, good price I stayed there with my husband for a few nights around Christmas time. We got a deluxe room with king size bed. The room was spacious with a good sized and very clean bathroom. Our only complaint was the air conditioning. The deluxe room is equipped with a/c (which you pay the extra $20 US for). Unfortunately, our air did not function correctly and we had to call reception several times before moving to a different room. Once we moved everything seemed to work fine. A week later, on the last leg of our trip before heading home, we tried our luck in a standard room. This was great (and cheaper). It was a bit smaller with a smaller bathroom, but all in all a very nice room.If you are looking for a luxury hotel, I would stay somewhere else, and pay a premium. If you are looking for a clean  spacious room in a great location, I would book the Maria Cristina.

<Content>Good Memories of The Maria Cristina I have stayed at this hotel several times. Admittedly I haven't been there in the last ten years but your reviewers seem to confirm what I remember. Also friends who have been staying there for years and have done so recently agree with my memory. I have traveled the world extensively and even though I have stayed at some very grand and quite famous hotels I will be staying at this hotel when I go to Mexico City later this year.The staff were very helpful especially the front desk. The rooms have always been satisfactory. While I do not recall the menu at the restaurant being very innovative I have always enjoyed my meals there.For my needs the location is fine. What others have said is true about feeling safe in the area, even when walking at night. Which is more than I can say for parts of Hollywood, California, where I live.Also it is nice to know that there is still somewhere you can smoke.

<Content>Great Hotel! This hotel is great! The staff is super friendly and everwhere is very very clean. You walk in and you are greeted with a smile. the rooms are very large and the rates are quite afordable. The restaurant in the hotel has great food and is reasonably priced. The travel guide, Arnaldo, who has a desk in the lobby is wonderful! He will take you wherever you want to go and he knows everything and pretty much everybody! I have no complaints whatsoever about the Hotel Maria Cristina!

<Content>Great choice We stayed at the Maria Cristina in Mexico City for four nights and were very pleased with it. Our room was quite large with a pretty view overlooking the central garden area. Our bathroom was nice and spacious. The room had a small refrigerator and of course TV and hair dryer. We paid 990 pesos a night, including tax (about $94), so I'm sure cheaper and more costly options abound. The Maria Cristina was pretty much perfect for us as a midrange option, neither bare-bones budget nor so luxurious you feel you're wasting your money. It felt very safe and clean. The lobby is pretty, with wrought iron and tilework. We ate only breakfast at the restaurant, but it was always good (maybe a little pricey). The desk clerks were very helpful and friendly, and their English was very good. There is a cramped little shop and a computer center with inexpensive access for guests. The hotel has a nice little bar with outdoor seating that is very pleasant at night. The location seemed good to me, maybe a 6-block walk to the Zona Rosa and its restaurants; also, about six blocks west on Rio Lerma is a happening couple of blocks with restaurants that are open at night (unlike many, which close for dinner). These are behind the Sheraton and El Angel, the independence monument. (Try the Argentine steakhouse.) The only hitch with the location of Maria Cristina is that the nearest subway stop, Independencia, is at least 6 or 7 blocks away. The walk gets a little old if you are going every day. The hotel does have its own cab stand outside. This hotel was recommended in The New York Times and by a friend of mine who lived in Mexico City.

<Content>Excellente choice, value and locationf for money I came to the hotel with doubts, as it wasn麓t in Zocalo area neather Polanco area. The reality is that is in between this two areas and near Condesa. You can not expect a five star facilities, but for the money that you pay is excelent. The hotel is a block from reforma on the other side of reforma from the Zona Rosa. It is an oasis of calm a tranquility in this big city. The garden is a place to relax and rest.I was very happy with my stay. The room for one is around 66 dolars and 74 for two. But be advise that are better room with A/C form 85 dolars.I would recomend this hotel for anyone that wants to try some thing different from big brands and do not want to spent over 100 dolars for two people.

<Content>An Oasis in the middle of the city, great location, and excelent value I have stay in this hotel many times, during the years.This past years, it has been some investment and improvements in the hotel in order to try to achieve a higher level of quiality.The experience in this hotel has been great and the tranquility and peace that offers is incomparable.You hace rooms for every budget different areas, and views. From single quite rooms looking to the patio to master suites overviewing the garden.The bar offers and excelent option for a nice drink and excelente waiters.The overall experience is excellent, and the investment observed in the hotel makes it even more attractive.

<Content>Getting tired of it i have stayed here a lot over the years but the hotel is going through problems and it shows. place is starting to look tired and it is not cheap. the 70 dollar room is small and the jr. suites in the back are almost $100.00. The management just won't change and are starting to get really cheap-skimping on water, toilet paper, no cloth napkins at the restaurant. dinner is around $20.00 and they want you to use tiny paper napkins. and the place is not as clean as it used to be-tired carpeting,bedspreads,bad internet service but the thing that I can no longer tolerate is the managements refusal to have non smoking sections. the smell of cigarettes is everywhere!it just creeps into your room and even when the hotel is empty, there will be a chain smoker next to you. The management is old school Spanish-from Spain and they will allow smoking cigars anywhere. It is getting disgusting.The restaurant is expensive and boring. I am glad to see options opening up in Mexico City.

<Content>Just Lovely... Maria Cristina was low-key but quite pretty (courtyard and fountain was a plus). I saw a few other, more modern hotels during my 8 day stay in Mexico City, but I will come back to Maria Cristina. The trick is to book your room in the new part of the hotel. The older part has small rooms and is worn down. My double (in the new section, my roomie arrived before me and switched our room from the old section to the new) had ample space, a large bathroom with a great shower, a large closet, a table with four chairs, tv, mini-fridge, and a dresser with a mirror (also, nice mirror in the bathroom). Very nice room for the money. The staff was very friendly and accomodating - some spoke English, but it's good to know some Spanish if you stay there. The restaurant in the hotel was nice - I only had breakfast there but it was always good. A taxi stand is right outside the hotel, and the hotel also has a service where they will help you plan excursions and day trips with drivers. Overall, I was very impressed with this hotel and would recommend it to everyone.

<Content>Great location and nice style I enjoyed my stay in the Maria Cristina, nice room, nice decoration, good service, good location (close to zona rosa) but ... beware that the rooms on the street are a bit noisy. The hotel has a nice patio but unfortunately you can't use it as there are no chairs or table: what a shame! The Internet connectivity is a bit complicated (you need to get these 1-hour passes from the reception)Overall a good value.

<Content>Great Staff, Excellent Restaurants, Pleasant Rooms ROOMS: Tried the single the first night. It was a tight fit and lacked air conditioning, but was adequate. Upgraded to a Deluxe Double thereafter that was quite spacious, clean and had a pleasant view of the courtyard.STAFF: Receptionists went, in my opinion, beyond the normal call of duty to help me and other guests with information...maps, phone numbers, itinerary information, etc. The restaurant staff was interminably patient despite energetic children dining. I also found the recommended doctor...Dr. Mora... very helpful when I was in need of services.RESTAURANT: Excellent variety, including calamar. Always pleased w/ the multiple meals I ate here. And I appreciated efforts to segragate smokers from non-smokers.ANCILLARY: Nice little shop offered essentials and postcards. Also, 3 Internet computers available 24x7, rather inexpensive and I never had to wait for one. Very attractive courtyard.LOCATION: OXXO selling Mazapan just two blocks away!!!!! :-) Very close to El Angel. Chapultepec w/in walking distance, but I took a taxi. Seemed to be a safe area, I never felt nervous day or night walking near the hotel.WOULD I STAY AGAIN: I would consider it. There are less expensive places, one of which I'll try in September...Hotel Fleming.

<Content>Ok but a bit overrated I would agree with the previous reviewer - nothing terrible, but nothing special. The garden is nice, the neighborhood quiet, but a bit shabby, and the hotel is getting a bit tired. And yes, the shower/bathtub is weirdly high. You almost need a ladder to get in. Restaurant wasn't bad - breakfast much better than dinner. Probably wouldn't ever go again though.

<Content>A bit of a disappointment After the rave reviews on this site I had expected something special so I was a bit disappointed. We had 3 rooms for 3 nights.Location: Quiet, easy to get anywhere by taxi, lot of rundown properties nearby.Room amenities: I missed having a clock/radio! Had a lot of minor problems - no water early one morning, no phone system one day, keycards didn't work etc. Plus a nearly 2 foot step to get into the bath which would have been difficult after a few beers (I didn't try).Restaurant: Much better than expected. 4-course lunch for under 10 dollars was well worth it. Excellent service. No high-chair for babies though.Overall there was a nice ambience, good service - but not much above average for 100 dollars a night.

<Content>We loved the Marie Cristina I stayed at the Maria Cristina with 3 other friends,we had a lovely time. The food in the restaurant is o.k. the waiters are very good and friendly. Only one problem. we booked 2 rooms with air conditioning but when we arrived they were not available. A bit disappointing but we didn't let it spoil our time there. If you want a tour of Mexico, ask for Javier, great taxi driver, very careful and a nice guy. Tell him Maria and her friends from England recommended him. I would recommend the Maria Cristina to anyone who wants a nice, clean friendly hotel with a family atmosphere in Mexico City at a reasonable cost.

<Content>Maria Cristina My second stay at this wonderful place confirms that it's my new favorite choice for Mexico City lodging. The many positive attributes are repeated in the other reviews; proximity, quiet neighborhood, historic building, character, price, etc. I had a wonderful time lounging in the bar as a vivacious group of Korean diplomats got me drunk and fed me interesting tales of current events, international politics, and dodge ball. Interesting people seem to be drawn to this place. I've observed that during both stays.  Looking forward to my next visit.

<Content>A Gem with Character I know Mexico City well, and when I was a kid in the 70's there used to be many hotels like the Maria Cristina...privately owned, well run, clean and, even though they weren't swanky or had tons of amenities, they were inviting and charming. If you'd prefer a soulless, overpriced business hotel that feels like Denver or Kyoto or Frankfurt, don't stay here; you don't deserve it. The Maria Cristina is a charming, well run, respectable hotel with a solid staff who have seen it all. The rooms are quite, cleaning ladies efficient, the restaurant a deal and all for WAY below what you'll pay at the Fiesta American or Sheraton...all in a great location. I'd rather you NOT know about this place, but I want to make sure they stick around for awhile and compete with the big guys around the block.

<Content>Perfect hotel We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights, and everything was perfect. Very comfortable rooms, well-equiped bathrooms, very quiet despite being close to the Reforma. Friendly staff and a beautiful colonial house....if you want to stay in Mexico City without paying the overpriced international chain-hotels, this is the ideal place.

<Content>Great Experience totally agree..our experience was good. The Maria Cristina is a great hotel for the casual or the business traveler. This 'classic choice for budget travelers' It was a very individual hotel, with a classic lobby, uniformed staff. Nice breakfast at restuarant  friendly waiters. We had a deluxe double standard room overlooking the garden. Very clean and nice linens. Very quiet. AC, windows opened  fan. We are non-smokers, not sure if they have non smoking rooms, but didn't smell. Had considered Camino Real, but after visiting by there, was glad we chose MC. Much more convient  nice Restuarants nearby.Also local artists in nearby park on Sunday.

<Content>Good value, but watch out for bait-and-switch Agree with most of what is written here re the Hotel Maria Cristina being a great value.Beware, though: When I checked in, they tried to upgrade me to a nicer room without mentioning that it would be significantly more expensive. The way they phrased it, I could easily have thought it was a free upgrade. Fortunately I decided to ask.Otherwise, great hotel for this price range.

<Content>An oasis in an excelent location This was a pleasent surprise:I am normally visiting high range hotels; but in this case it was a recomendation from a friend.His words were, clean, friendly, with similarities with high range hotels but with the extra of trnaquility and a nice garden and bar.In my opinion he was not wrong.In the middle between the zocalo and Polanco, and very close to zona rosa. What else can you ask for?

<Content>Great Value We were very impressed with the value of the Maria Cristina. It is centrally located, quiet, and clean. The restaurant is quite nice, with good Mexican fare and attentive service. It is helpful for visitors to speak Spanish. If you are looking for luxury accommodations, this is not the place for you, but if you are looking for a nice, centrally located hotel at budget prices, you've come to the right place!

<Content>Great Value The Maria Cristina is a great hotel for the casual or the business traveler. On our recent trip to Mexico City I made the mistake of passing by this 'classic choice for budget travelers' and trying to go more upmarket. Unfortunately the Maria Cristina turned out to be a nicer hotel for more than half the price. It is a very individual hotel, but has a classic lobby, uniformed staff, and rooms which are made up to the standard of any large chain hotel. The bed and pillows were by far the fluffiest we had in Mexico. Don't do what I did and be put off by the price; it's just a great deal. Also, their taxi service was a great way to get around and stay safe; it is just a few dollars more than the sito taxis and has knowledgable drivers who speak English.

<Content>Less than we expect Not as good as the pictures on its website. At least we had a dark room, just average. Quite far from Metro, but conveniently close to Av. Insurgentes where Metrobus, a reliable bus service, run along. There are convenience stores around, but most restaurants are some blocks away in uglier Zona Rosa. Helpful staff, there are weird shops beside the lobby and an expensive internet cab. There is also a restaurant who serves a good breakfast, not included.

<Content>Maria Cristina's location When I first read the reviews of the hotels in Mexico City I couldn't decide between Casa Gonzalez and Maria Cristina. I loved the great reviews of Maria Cristina but thought from some of the comments that is was too far away from everything. After staying there that I can now give you more information about this. It is only about a 5 minute walk to Reforma which is a large boulevard with mini buses running in each direction every 3 minutes or so. These buses cost about 30 cents to get on. You can pay the driver and they run from one end of the city to the other(from the Almeda which is a 20 minute walk to the Zocolo to Chapultepec Park which is where there are 3 major museums as well as other attractions). But the best part is that you can take the buses to the metro station Hildago and use the metro to go anywhere in the city. So don't worry about the location. It is far better than being near the Zocolo in my opinion. The Zocolo is very noisy an not very clean from what I saw. The Zona Rosa is also a short walk away from the Maria Cristina. The cheaper rooms at this hotel are now about $75 a bit up from the rate quoted in several reviews. The rooms are adequate, clean, good water pressure, and the one I was in looked onto a beautiful garden and a bar belonging to the hotel.  The room was very quiet and comfortable. The lobby was large and there is a nice restaurant attached to the hotel. There is also internet service available.

<Content>Enjoyed the Maria Cristina Great location, within walking distance of Zona Rosa. Nice people and real clean. Ask for a room with the air conditioner otherwise it can get a little stuffy in the room. Also negotiate with the tour company if you plan on a day trip. The tour company is located in the hotel.

<Content>Excellent price, excellent location This is an excellent hotel. My husband and I usually come to Mexico for business and stay here. The prices are quite good and the service impeccable, the hotel clean and the location great. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is even good. Polanco, Las Lomas, Zona Rosa, La Condesa, all these neighborhood are within easy rich of MC. Highly recomendable!

<Content>An Excellent Hotel in Mexico City We got a recommendation from the Conde Neste magazine, checked the Tripadvisor, and tried Maria Crisitina last week. The best hotel value pretty much anywhere in North America! Great location -- right off Reforma in Col. Cuahtemoc, close to all downtown attractions, across Reforma from Zona Rosa. Side street -- hence very quiet. Attractive surroundings, for an inexpensive urban hotel. Excellent service. New rooms -- ask for the newer part of the hotel with AC and all modern amenities. Big comfortable beds and everything nice and clean. Free valet parking -- and completely safe -- in the center of town!!! Internet available for a nominal fee. A very good traditional Mexican restaurant on premises. And the price -- the most expensive (non-suite) room: $73 (US). Overall -- a U.S. Hilton or Marriott standard at half the price. What else to you need? If you want to pay under $100 a night in Mexico City and stay at an excellent hotel -- go to Maria Cristina.
