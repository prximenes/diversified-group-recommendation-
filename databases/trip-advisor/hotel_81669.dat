<Content>Pure luxury, what an experience! This hotel is pure luxury. Our room was beautifully furnished; modern, contemporary and overall spacious, we had TWO double beds! The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the location of the hotel is fantastic - a 10min cab ride to Mission, the cooler part of San Fran, and a 5 min walk to Union Square where all the shops are. Best of all are the toiletries, which are all Bliss products - what more does a girl need! The gym is fully equipped and there is also a litle outdoor area, I think it's on the same floor as the gym, where you can sit in peace and quiet and read a book whilst catching a bit of the California sun (or getting over jetlag, as I did!)I would stay here again in a flash, in fact I could live here!

<Content>Trendy hotel in decent neighborhood I stayed at this hotel for a quick business trip. Front desk service was not the best- we had to wait to get checked in despite the fact that there were 2 people behind the counter doing absolutely nothing!It was worth the wait because the room itself was very nice. A bit on the trendy side but nonetheless, nicely decorated with great views. There was free internet access and I found the beds to be quite comfortable. Toiletries from Bliss were an added plus.Having come from the East Coast, I was starving when I got to the hotel so I tried to see what they had in the the snack pantry. I was a little disturbed to see that some of their snacks (peanuts, candy, granolabars) were still there despite having an expiration date of 1/2008 (I was there in Nov). Needless to say, I decided to go elsewhere to pick up some food.Concierge was very helpful and recommended a good restaurant within walking distance. The location is decent. Very close to MOMA and an entertainment complex though there weren't too many restaurants close by. I got back a little late but the hotel was hopping! It looks like its a popular place for the young trendy crowd. All in all, I enjoyed my stay. Not sure if I would choose to stay there if I were spending my own money, but on the company dime, it was very nice.

<Content>Bad Internet, Bad Lighting, Bad Telephone Avoid Starwood hotels, especially the WAfter being driven out of the $600 a night Starwood St. Regis in San Francisco because the heat wouldn鈥檛 work in either of the rooms they gave me, I registered in the Starwood $400 a night San Francisco W down the street at 181 3rd St. where the heat did work. The W has all kinds of cutsie nonsense that gets in the way of comprehension. The operator answers with 鈥渨hat is your wish.鈥?My wish of course is that she would answer with 鈥渙perator.鈥?The Internet service costs $15 a day but it stinks. Much better speed is available for free at any $150 a night motel. It would not run consistently faster than 200 kilobits per second which 20 or 30 times slower than a typical home DSL line. My slingbox would not work and it took forever to download files. W Internet is a small step above using a phone modem. Apparently the W is on an insane drive to save electricity. The room lighting is terrible. I happened to have a light meter with me so I took some measurements. At the work desk the illumination was 22 lux. There is no lamp or light anyplace near the desk. 22 lux is considered to be a light level suitable for inactive areas of warehouses. Offices work spaces are supposed to have 500 lux. If you want to read in bed at the W the light level is about 90 lux, a low but not impossible level for reading. The window benches have their own light which is so dim as to provide only 15 lux. The only place in the room with decent illumination was near the bathroom mirror where it reached 400 lux. The telephone in my W room started beeping at 3 AM for no apparent reason that I could discern even after several minutes of deciphering the instructions on the telephone printed in tiny, low-contrast type. Yes, I had my reading glasses on. It wouldn鈥檛 stop beeping even when I unplugged the connecting wires. I called the 鈥渨hat is your wish鈥?lady to ask what do to. She didn鈥檛 know but offered to send someone to the room. Apparently calling the operator stopped the beeping. My next step would have been to put the telephone in the hall. The room was nicely furnished, even beautiful. But if they can鈥檛 get lighting, Internet and telephone right why would you want to stay in this expensive hotel?

<Content>Amazing Serice, with a hip flair Myself and my wife arrived late on Thanksgiving for our anniversay and stayed 2 nights. It was our second trip to the W so we knew what to expect, but we were given more. The manager Ashley whom was in charge the two nights we were there, did everything she could to make the trip special. We love the atmosphere as it is both family and adult. The lobby area is great as there are things for the kids to do and a bar for the adults right when you walk in the front door. The rooms are very unique, with vibrant colars that just make you want to take like in and conquer the city. GREAT PLACE.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel, Nice location Very nice hotel. This place was close to all of the shopping areas and the downtown area, but still a little of the beaten path so it wasn't too crowded at night. I was upgraded to the suite, which was big, and the beds, as with every Starwood, were very comfortable. I know it's not the cheapest place, so it may not be the best for the money, but it was a nice stay, and a nice bar downstairs.

<Content>what a joke $650 a night and what do you get? The concierge was clueless about what is going on. I asked about the architectural tour -- there was a whole month of events relating to building in SF. Blank stare. She gives me a local magazine/advertising booklet with no information. We have to pay for wi-fi! Nice large bathroom, but the water pressure shoots out in spurts. When I arrive I check my bags in early as the room isn't ready yet, and receive a supercilious sheesh from the check-in clerk when I do so, due to my orange backpack. He fixes it so we have one of the worst rooms in the hotel....When I do come back later I find that our room is not what we reserved and it is hazy with smoke. Thick, heavy cigar smoke permeated the sheets and air. Disgusting and ridiculous. We go back downstairs and the manager gives us another room. Again, this is for a 650$ a night room. The elevator has a card reader so you cannot ascend unless you insert your room key. Fine. I understand security, but it does not work most of the time. Breakfast is also extra! The firm picked up the tab -- this wasn't my pick. Completely absurd and overpriced. A sad joke.

<Content>Comfortable  I booked this stay with points and based on reviews wasn't expecting a whole lot. I agree that the trendy/sceney vibe is a little annoying but overall I was really happy with the hotel. The room was big and comfortable with great views, and the museum next door is a fun place to visit. We got room service and were happy with the food, although it was expectedly a little overpriced. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel -- my only real complaint is they charge guests $45 for overnight parking!

<Content>It was okay this time I've stayed at this hotel a few times and I must say that the trendy-chic atmosphere that they go for is starting to get a little tiring. The rooms have been remodeled, and while I get the Asian theme for it is San Francisco, it turned out a bit cheesy. The hotel lobby or living room was also redone, but it now has several different themes going on in one room. It's like part modern art, and part visual clutter.The view of the Bay Bridge is awesome if you can get a room facing east. The beds and pillows are incredibly comfortable. The bathrooms are neat and roomy.I ordered room service for the next morning and the breakfast was cold and didn't taste very fresh. If you're going to spend that much on food, go downstairs to the XYZ restaurant where the food is fresher! Drinks in the lobby are very good...if you don't mind spending $12-13 per drink.In all due respect, I must say that the service has improved a lot over the past few years. In the past, I remember the staff being on the snooty side, as if they were trying to be too 'cool'. They are a lot warmer and friendlier nowadays - especially the concierge and the restaurant/bar staff. I would recommend this hotel especially for a younger crowd. If you are bringing your mother, stick to the Palace or Westin hotel.

<Content>WAY over rated!!! Normally don't write reviews but this place is so over rated and over priced that we felt obligated to warn others. We travel extensivley and the only people I can see that may comment otherwise on this site would be the hotel managers! Stayed 3 days at the hotel and checked out early as the rooms, food and spa were not even close to fairly priced (about double what they should be easily). Moved to the Hilton financial district and better room for half price and better spa treatment at about 65% of W's Bliss cost. Likely will never try a W again but bought in to their hype on how great they are for one time and too late now.

<Content>Awful service, good enough design The renovation gave this hotel a much needed face lift. That being said, the service at the front desk, office area, and parking area was about on par with a Motel 6 or Days In. To be fair, the Concierge desk was great, and the people in the cafe and restaurant were wonderful. But, what good is that when the people you have to interact with are rude, inept, pretentious, contentious and just downright offensive? Then again, what can you expect from a corporate chain hotel?

<Content>An average W Nice hotel, centrally situated, with spacious and comfortable rooms. I frankly don't understand why W hotels have to be so poorly lighted in the inside, but perhaps it's only a matter of taste. As other guest mentioned, noise from the fire station can be annoying.

<Content>A Unique Hotel experience We were a party of 5 who spent 5 nights at this hotel. We reserved 2 rooms so that we could have some privacy from our children. The configuration was ideal: we had a private entrance to a corner room and a room with double beds. The rollaway we requested did not fit into the room with the double beds but there was plenty of room in the king corner. The youngest child, however, opted to sleep on the large window seat with the other 2. The decor is unique and rather restful. The museum is right next door and union square was close by. The concierge sent us to a wonderful Italian restaurant 2 blocks away, which we frequented several times during our stay. Beds were great. The concierge desk needs more help. There was usually a line of people waiting. Lobby is fun. Pool is indoors and was well maintained. We had a very pleasant stay.

<Content>The good the bad and the downright ugly! The hotel is centrally situated and the staff were mostly friendy (I find ou always get the odd staff member who seems to think they are doing you a favour). The rooms were spacious and comfortable (we had 2 rooms next to eachother with a lobby outside) the glow in the dark Buddha was a bit weird though! The worst thing about the hotel is that it is directly above the fire station and the sirens sound through most of the night. This meant that the first few nights we stayed were sleepless until we adjusted and became accustomed to the noise. The lobby and the bar are far too noisy and most of the crowds seems to gather near the lifts which makes moving baggage round quite difficult.

<Author>hcb10960
<Content>a little disappointed... Usually love the W hotels we stay in. This one, not so much. The SFW was a little too fabulous for my taste. Loved the lobby and bar. The room decor was a little strange. They wanted to go for a Japanese-y-modern thing which ended up looking more like stuff just stuck on the old W furniture. However, my 12 year old son and I agreed that the glowing fiber optic Buddha was very cool.Generally, I found the desk staff a little stand-offish and not particularly welcoming, save one really, really lovely concierge. Service in the room was mostly great except for the bell services at both ends of the trip. There wasn't one anywhere in sight during the entire check-in. When leaving, we called down to have our bags removed from our room, after 30 minutes and a phone call we finally took our bags down ourselves. Gratefully, there was no traffic and our plane was delayed.When traveling to SF again, we will probably go to the Westin.

<Content>Good hotel if you love the scene.... I used to go to San Francisco very often for work and my company usually booked us at the W Hotel since it's very close to our offices and able to accommodate a large of my colleagues. It's about 35 minutes from the airport without traffic.I've found this hotel at times very helpful at times but at other times very careless. The last time I stayed in this hotel was a little bit of a hassle. I had to fly in late the night I was supposed to check in. With delays at the airport, I was not in San Francisco until 2am in the morning and had to wake up at 6am for an early meeting. Knowing that I was going to be late for checking in, I had called earlier to make sure I will be okay and the reception said there shouldn't be any problem. Once I have arrived, I was told they were under renovation and my room is not ready until tomorrow...I then had to go across the street to St. Regis hotel (which I did not mind since it's a much nicer hotel) for the night and by the time I got into bed, it was already 4am in the morning and I had to get up a little earlier to check back into the W Hotel....They felt bad for me and gave me a corner room once I checked back in and a Bliss gift basket which was really nice of them. The room is an average size and being it was just renovated, everything was pretty new and clean. The thing I like about this hotel is the gym which is open 24 hours so I can go late at night to exercise and it's nice and quiet because there is no way one could squeeze into the exercise room in the morning. The food at the restaurant downstairs is pretty good and if you want to go out, the concierge is excellent at getting a reservation for you. The only thing that I'm not crazy about this place is the party scene since it could get really obnoxious and loud. I don't mind it if the scene were a little further away from the entrance to the elevator. I was once harassed by a random man during a party night near the elevator but I told him to bug off! Since then, I felt like I had to make a dash for the elevator every time there was a party going on. The hotel is not very far from Union Square and takes about 10 minutes to walk there and it's also right next to MOMA SF. I wouldn't mind staying in this hotel again on vacation if they could just move the party scene further away from the elevator...

<Content>Ok with some nice things Nice hotel I suppose - service was really great. Small glitch with room service, but made up in quality of food. There were people all around quite willing to help. Breakfast was very good. They have a regular resturant as well as a faster juice/coffee bar with bagels, etc. and small tables for a quick bite. Our server for breakfast in the resturant was Scott. The best, and I mean, the best waiter I have ever had. He could work in some five star places and would be the best. Was very patient with my daughter and was always there to check on things without being intrusive. Rooms are small...and I mean small. Very boxy (rectangular shape small). Let me qualify that by saying there were two adults and two small kids. But, well appointed and Funny thing was that they placed the guests with kids as much as possible on the same floor (15th). Good for them to think of that for the benefit of the other guests. Room amenities were nicely done. The bliss toiletries were no big deal to me. Beds were comfortable. Air Con system was funky. Had a motion detector system - when no movement in the room, the thing was shut down if not off. Got stuffy at times and quite warm in room.

<Content>Love the Bliss Toiletries, Indifferent on the Upscale IKEA-ish Furnishings The W San Francisco fully embodies Starwood's branding play for the trendy professional. It's in the perfect location if you're attending a conference at Moscone Center. I wouldn't recommend the W for families or a romantic getaway.Check-in and Check-out went smoothly. All employees were very courteous and friendly. The room was comfy with an upscale IKEA-like decor. Some things I particularly liked: Bliss shampoo/conditioner/facewash, the massaging roller for your feet under the desk, a rather large wall-mounted flat-screen TV, and the very novel hotel stationery. One suggestion for improvement (very minor issue): They need bigger, fluffier bath towels. For a higher-end brand like the W, i didn't expect standard size bath towels with a slightly coarse feel. Breakfast at the restaurant was delicious with typical hotel pricing. Once again, the W is great for the trendy professional who loves the hustle and bustle. Hope this helps! Cheers.

<Content>Over Rated Me and my husband traveled to San Fransisco on vacation. We booked this hotel using our Starwood points, so I can't complain about the price. The room lokoed like it was remodeled. They advertise a heavenly shower but I would not say it was heavenly at all. The concierge was very helpful, as was the front desk staff. However, my suggestion would be to not go to the bar or restaraunt there, the service was horrible and we 2 of the 3 people that were in the bar at the time. The views were great of the city and the location was very central.

<Content>Trendy and Spendy, As Always I stayed at the W for four nights to attend a conference at the Moscone Center. I've stayed there twice before and this stay was consistent with my prior experience. I've stayed in both the Cool Corner and Spectacular rooms. The Cool Corner rooms are larger and have better seating, although the desk area is larger in the Spectacular which can come in handy if you have to do a lot of work in the room.The decor is bright and friendly, and I really enjoyed the fact that I could close the mirrored doors over the TV and not have to see it. The beds are very comfortable, and the bathrooms come stocked with Bliss brand toiletries. (I usually snag a couple of the soaps to use at home.)I had need to use room service quite a bit. Breakfast was super-expensive relative to what you get, and not as nice as the other meals. I paid $44 for an omelette, toast, home fries, orange juice (not fresh) and coffee, and the eggs were rubbery, although the potatoes were good. Still, $44 is a heck of a lot of money for breakfast, so most mornings I hoofed it over to the Peet's on 3rd and Mission for better coffee.Lunch and dinner choices were better - the Cobb Salad was especially good. Still, an entree and an iced tea tended to land in the $35 range.I realy enjoy the ambience of the lobby bar. It's trendy without being snobby, and the service is very good even when the place is crowded.If you can get a weekend deal here, it's certainly worth it. It's walking distance to the ballpark, BART, right next to SFMOMA and it's easy to get pretty much anywhere without a car.All in all, I always enjoy the San Francisco W. But if I was spending my own money, I'd look for bargain rates and avoid the room service.

<Content>Surprise stay at the W I was in San Francisco (again) the end of March, I had originally booked the Westin on Market and Third. But due to my late flight, by the time we arrived at the Westin they were overbooked. The night manager gave us a letter and sent us over to the W. I have been in the W before for drinks, but had never stayed there. They had great modern decor, and their color scheme worked very well. The rooms were a bit squished, for 4 people, but manageable. We had a great view of the bay bridge. Overall stay was very nice, the staff was also very helpful, and inviting (especially checking in at 1 A.M.).

<Content>Pretty good business hotel Stayed for a 4 night business trip recently.Gets 3 starts for guest experience, and 1 more star for having a very lively lobby bar/lounge scene and a great location for business travelers. Corner Fabulous Room on high floor only had so-so views (certainly not panoramic. Be sure to ask for Bay Bridge view rooms. Plenty of space in room, but most of it was hallway and bathroom space. Did not feel the room was laid out well (ie, no great place to eat some food, can only watch TV from bed). Desk was way too small for a room that size. Room furnishings were modern and mostly tasteful, if a bit kitschy. Definitely not dull! Room and bathroom were very clean, but some of the furnishings (cushions, bedspread, light fixtures) were starting to show their wear a bit.Staff was mostly moronic. Seemed very young and inexperienced, and certainly do not go out of their way to help. This applies mainly to the front desk staff. The concierges were all extremely courteous and helpful, though they steered us to more touristy, safe bets.Gym was certainly nice, clean, and usable, a major plus.Note that internet access is $15 extra per day. I still do not understand why hotels do this. I find it insulting. Please, just add $15 /night to the rack rate and be done with it.Best plus of hotel is the location (across the street from the Moscone center, by far the closest hotel the center). Second best plus is the great and dependable bar scene in the lobby. It was pretty funny to walk in late at night on a Friday night to check in, lugging luggage, and have to fight my way through a posh crowd all holding drinks! Note, though, that there are bascially no other good bars/nightspots within walking distance.Overall, a dependable business hotel with a few pluses (decent gym, good bar, good location), and a few minuses (overall service, rooms somewhat poorly designed).

<Content>City Central at the W My partner and I, both in our early 40s, stayed at the W for a weekend getaway from Los Angeles. If you're familiar with the W brand, it's very typical, with all the hipness you can stand. This hotel seems to be a bit more of a weekend destination than most. Friday and Saturday nights were quite the scene in the bar upstairs and downstairs as well. Located in the SoMa area, there's plenty nearby, Union Square, the Ferry Building, SFMOMA. Overall, a good experience.

<Content>I was surprisingly happy... Had read some of the reviews and was a little nervous to book here. Despite its name and priciness, some of the reviews had been less than kind.However, my experience was surprisingly glitch-free. I arrived tired and cranky at 11 pm (yes, my plane was delayed, delayed, and delayed...!). However, Rebecca at check in was cheerful, sympathetic and helpful. Gave me a quiet room away from the ice machine, elevators, etc. Heaven!The bedding was comfortable and clean (unfortunately, not always the case even at other nice hotels these days...). The big screen plasma tv, the ipod docking station, the in-room safe, and even a chinese checkers game (!) along with numerous local SF magazines, were very nice extras which made the place seem more welcoming.My room had a wide cushioned window bench seat where i sat and looked at the Bay Bridge and also surprisingly saw glorious fireworks over the water on Sun. nite!Restaurant food was good, but pricey. Places to get some food within a block; Ferrari's Italian Deli ($$, but great sandwich, cheese and crackers selections), a Starbucks on the corner, a Chevy's (Mexican) Grill next to it. Avoid the little Japanese small sitdown/takeout place in that same area. Nice people working there, but the food was forgettable.If you need to take a shuttle back to the airport, try Go Lorrie's. It costs the same as the other shuttles (all of them are in the $15-18 range to and from SFO). But the W is the guaranteed last hotel stop prior to going to the airport, so you spend less time cooling your heels waiting for other passenger pickups. When you are tired and just want to get to the airport to return home, thats a nice plus.A HUGE plus for this hotel is that it is right across the street from the Convention Center. Made it very easy to go back to the hotel if I forgot something or just wanted to chill between seminars.And finally, check out was fast and efficient and Adam at the front desk was courteous and very helpful.Even tho it is more expensive than many of the hotels in the area, I would definitely stay at the W again when i have to go to the Convention Center. You get your moneysworth!

<Content>Perfect hotel for conference center Hi! I got a very good pricing for this hotel because I was a part of a large convention last September.The hotel is very clean, very nice.The welcome at our arrival was warm. We got a room at the 18th level with very nice view of the city.The interior pool is small but the area is nice and quiet. A top terrasse is just beside the pool. This area is really relax and you can take some bath sun their (when the weather allows it).The lobby is particuliary very busy during Friday evening. The party is in the lobby, not into a separate part. I don't like it.The concierge service is a nice touch and you can ask for everything - taxi call; bus intinary - opening hours - restaurant suggestion and reservations! Great touche!The bed are really confortable.The location is nice for assisting to conference. The Yueba buena garden is just in front of the hotel. This garden is a nice place..... But the location of the hotel is not exceptionnal for tourist sightseeing....The regular pricing of this hotel is really expensive at regular pricing and I think you will pay for the W brand name.... This hotel is a boutique hotel. But the luxury is not really present. It's more a relax hotel - or hotel with a lot of pretention.The wifi access into the lobby was very helpful during the convention.The design is nice but nothing new.

<Content>Posh and modern, but NOT like Clift I just completed a four-night stay at the W San Fran (Room 2304). This was a last-minute business trip for a large conference, so the city was nearly full. Basically, my administrator booked me wherever she could get a room, so I didn't actually pick to stay here. This was a really nice hotel and I had a great stay, the W brand just isn't my style. I prefer more traditional surroundings to the modern luxury that W hotels offer. Overal, this hotel is full of really attractive young people (there was a photo shoot in the lobby one of the days I stayed). It has every amenity you could possibly ask for, and it's in a decent location. The W is going for posh and modern. While it certainly hits the mark, a more true experience (for a higher price) can be found at Clift on Geary Street...THE GOOD- The staff is really helpful and nice (W in Times Square NYC has a pretentious staff)- The hotel is full of attractive people- I had an amazing view of the Bay Bridge- Flat screen TV- Alarm clock w/ iPod dock- One block from the Moscone Center- One block from Yerba Buena Gardens- One block from the San Fran MoMA- Two blocks from Market Street- 10 minute walk from Union SquareTHE NOT-SO GOOD- Expensive room- Good location for business, but not for going out- Decent restaurants, not great- Doesn't match the luxury that can be found at Clift, although the W makes a great attempt** This is an expensive hotel that should be set aside for those younger travels who want to part of the in crowd but just can't really afford it yet. The rest of us are staying at Clift on Geary :) **

<Content>Good Experience Spent two nights at the W and it was just what I would expect from a W. The front desk was friendly and efficient. Even though I was early, they were able to get me into my room right away.I was on the 29th floor and had a great view of the city. The room was very clean and had nice amenities (ipod charger, conveniently located electrical plugs, books about SF, DVD player). Love the bliss products in the bathroom. As usual, for a Starwood property, the bed was soooooo comfortable. The location was great, very centrally located for shopping, dining and public transportation. The hotel definitely caters to a younger, hipper crowd than I, but I never felt out of place. I had a drink at the hotel bar and the bartender was friendly and made a great cocktail.I liked it better then some of the other W's I have stayed at and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Over 21 only For those thinking of staying here. it is a small lobby with a bar like atmosphere. The bar turns into the breakfast cafe. Resturant expensive and too gormet. My kids liked the cool interior, rooms small but decorated like urban outfitters. Would not recommend famliy or children. Christmas time, only winter arangements nothing that suggests Christmas. Close to Convention Center and museum 3 long blocks to the back side of Bloomindales. Better hotels and locations if you are interested in shopping. Westin St Francis, Parc 55, Marriott....

<Content>Trendy, but with warmth I have stayed in a several trendy hotels through the years, but found them a bit cold in appearance. Not the W - the strike just the right balance between trendy and warm.We paid $209 per night, which is a lot lower than usual, so we felt we got a great value. Great location in SF, and free coffee in the morning. The restaurant is a bit pricy, but very good.

<Content>Stylish hotel with great bar Booking was really easy with very friendly staff. It was a great hotel to stay in when you just get off the plane from the UK as it's very comfortable, with great views and lovely Bliss products in the bathroom. The reception has a constant welcoming fire where guests can sit and relax on sofas. Once you have got over your jet lag, you can head out to the shops on Market St, only a 5 min walk away. In the evenings, the W has a really funky bar with with a live dj playing electro music.

<Content>Great stay, not worth the money anymore though. Got a lovely new remodeled corner room with a fabulous city view, the rooms again were great, clean and crisp. Not very functional, no phone jack by the bed, alarm clock was dim and hard to reach, plug for hair dryer was right near sink! I think while being hip, functionality loses place. Service was great, valet guys were the best, concierge was excellent. Pool was cold and the hot tub had a smell to it. Breakfast was prompt and awesome, room service and in the restaurant also. Overall no complaints, turndown service though sucked, they always came late and never really did a turndown. Parking is a lot also, but the same everywhere in SF. Overall a great stay but getting hard to justify these prices they are charging unless your company is footing the bill.

<Content>relaxing stay The W is extemely close to the Moscone Convention Center and was the reason I chose this property for a convention. While some of the amenities are a little more hip than I am, the staff were more than helpful and the room extremely comfortable. Many things were overpriced ($8 bottle of water in the room), but plenty of shopping availabe close by to find affordable snacks/drinks.

<Content>Business Travelers Beware Business travelers beware. This is a fabulous hotel to stay for leisure - but if you plan to work, get ready for super high Internet costs. On a 4-day business trip the Internet bill added up to over $300 and it would have been over $500 if we hadn't been hard nosed and negotiated. Break down: $15 per day per room, $5 per 15 minutes in the business office (rediculous!!!!). We also used a (small) conference room for the day (acutally used it for less than 12 hours) - and they were going to charge $500 for 3 users - yes Five Hundred Dollars for 3 people to use the Internet (in addition to the $600 for the room fee). When I questioned this, we were told to name a price and reluctantly settled at $250. It was robbery. If we didn't have to work, it would not have been a problem. They offer free wireless in the lobby - but who can do serious work in the lobby?? Gee thanks, W. I've never been nickled and dimed so much for such a mundane thing as the Internet. It made our trip frustrating and much more expensive than it needed to be. So despite all of the lovely decor, the personable and friendly staff, none of it mattered because of their crazy fees. I mean who pays money to use the Internet in the business office!?!?!? Crazy man, crazy.

<Content>Just What I Expect From A W My wife and I stayed at the W as a surprise to her on the weekend that I proposed. It's the third W that we have stayed at and the experiance was the exact same as the other two. Everything from check-in to check-out was perfect and very professional.We were upgraded to a corner room upon check in and given champagne and strawberries and the whole works. The room was great as I had expected with good window seats and a great view. Bar area was very good and active throughout the weekend.Another great experiance at a W.

<Content>Bad experience on a get away weekend My wife and I were on a weekend getaway and the W did it's best to bring us down. We arrived and were given a room with two double beds. We didn't arrange weekend babysitting to sleep in separate small beds, so after our second request they moved us to a room on a lower floor with a king sized bed. The room鈥檚 windows were mostly obscured by a tent used for events which was a bummer but at least we could sleep in the same bed. We went out and had a great evening with dinner at Jardiniere and drinks at Zuni. We were woken up at 4am that morning by loud people in the hot tub. Once again, we didn't arrange for weekend babysitting to get woken up in the middle of the night. I called down to the desk in the morning to mention the late night revelry. They thought it was odd that I could hear people in the pool area and said sorry, they would notify security. Upon checkout I was asked how I enjoyed my stay. I mentioned my displeasure again. The person asked if I had tried breakfast at XYZ, and I thought, ah, someone wants to do something to make my $800 stay at this hotel feel a little more right, but no. Upon mentioning that I had just had breakfast there and the food was just fine, the person said Well I am glad something good happened. Oh, well. Sometimes you get what you pay for, sometimes you don't. On my trip to the W, I didn't enjoy the hotel at all. SF was great and the weather was perfect.

<Content>Great location, nice hotel Just wrapping up a stay at the W Hotel in San Francisco. It's been an extremely nice stay and I quite enjoyed the room.The W's location is great - very close to all the shopping, dining, etc on Market St. (if you're an SPG member and location is key to you, SPG has several properties all within a few blocks of one another around Market St. including Westin St. Francis, Westin Market St, St. Regis, W, and Palace Hotel and so you have a lot of really great options). I stayed in a high-floor Fabulous room which had ample space and a nice, large bathroom. As with some of the other Ws I've stayed it, some of the furniture was more stylish than functional/comfortable (such as the desk chair) but the bed and pillows were fantastic. Always tend to find great beds/pillows at Ws. Work space was very well done, with plenty of outlets and internet hookups conveniently located (I hate having to dig around a room looking for a place to plug your cell phone charger or laptop in to). The view from many of the higher floors is great, as well. I had a wonderful view of the surrounding city scape and bay.Depending on the time of night, things can get pretty crazy at the entrance to the hotel. Cars were backed up well down the street trying to pull in to the hotel's driveway as valet attendants scrambled around, but quite frankly as I walked around the neighborhood I saw the exact same thing happening at other hotels in and around 3rd St. and Market St. so I think that's just more of a San Francisco/Market St/Union Sq. issue than it is a W issue. Despite that, everytime I got my car out of valet it didn't take long at all (even if I didn't call down ahead of time).Room service was good. Didn't blow me away, but didn't disappoint, either. It was delivered in a timely fashion, though. I'd suggest requesting a table with your room service as most rooms don't have much of a seating area fit for dining. Lobby (Living Room) scene wasn't as wild and crazy as some of the other Ws I've stayed at (at the W San Diego there was a line down the street of people waiting to get inside to hang out at the lobby bar!), where it's like going through a nightclub on your way between the street and elevators but it was lively and obviously a popular place to hangout in nonethelessAll in all, a comfortable stay with helpful staff (all friendly and ready and able to give directions and advice on what to do and see whenever I asked for it).

<Content>Definitely Worth a Stay Yes, the W Hotel is a trendy, cool, sylist establishment. But, so what? They actually do most things very well. Check in was not overly efficient nor warm but it was fine (and it's only check in). We had requested the front desk notify us when our missing bags arrived from the airport - which they failed to do - but we eventually retrieved them. Other than those two issues, no problems. The room was a little small but very clean and efficient. The small, lighted budha was a little strange but entertaining. The view was good, the bar was not as much as a scene as you might have expected (at least on a Tuesday night) and the food was good. The gym was a little small but had eveything you needed and the equipment was good. Location was fairly close to all. It was a little expensive but not sure if so on a comparative basis - perhaps worth checking other hotels first. Definitely worth a stay though perhaps not for families with younger kids.

<Content>Modern and Pricey I was hesitant to book this hotel as I prefer older properties with a sense of history. But my husband had just recently stayed at the W in San Diego on business and suggested we should try the W in San Fran for our Labor Day weekend getaway. At first I tried booking at all the famous hotels, but there was simply no availablity or they were just really overpriced. The W was fine - I just wish I was 10lbs lighter and 10 years younger! Talk about all the beautiful people! It definitely is a hopping scene after 10pm in the bar area. Although the restaurant was very expensive - we had to eat there the first nite as it was too late to go anywhere else. The staff was great, they accomodated our 2 yr old daughter and even created a dish off the menu for her. She loved it and our daughter is quite the picky eater! By far my favorite thing about the W was the bedding - yes the bedding. I've never had such a comfy mattress and sumptuous linens before. Also the hotel was able to accomodate us w/ 2 rooms together as we were with my sister and nephew. The concierge was great, though overwhelmed at times obviously with so many people wanting restaurant reservations or other service. One little detail I should mention just in case u also are not told, when i called the front desk and asked about free internet use I was told there was none, but if we had a laptop we could pay with a credit card in our room. But when I again checked with the lobby I was told one can use a laptop for free as they are hooked up in the lobby. Overall it was a great modern hotel if u are not one for history and afternoon tea hour. One more thing the hotel is on the same block as the Museum of Modern Art - so can't beat the location.

<Content>The BEST W in the system The W's have sucked in my opinion for the last 3 years or so. This one far outshines them all. The vibe is cool, the rooms are full-on W, the service flawless.MASSIVE bathrooms, ultra hip door guys and super mod girls make you feel like you've arrived. The lounge are is open, free-wheeling and very very cool.The W's have been off my radar for some time now but this one make up for all the past errors the W's have amassd with me.Good job, W SF.

Nothing bad to report here except the bar staff at closing time. Rude, ignorant people. Will not even give you a glass of tap water at closing time. Of course they expect you to go to your room and take the bottle of water from the cupboard ful of goodies and pay 11 dollars for it!!!! Oh and one scary thing... they KNOW when uve had it, without even going into your room!! bit like big brother or something!

<Content>W San Francisco I have stayed at the W many times in S.F. and this is the last. They remodeled the rooms and they aer awful..Lime green accents...come on we are not in SOBE very distasteful, furniture very uncomfortable. They put these white leather adjustable chairs in the rooms that don't adjust I cannot believe they got rid of the big comfortable sturdy chairs with arms for these. The desk is way too narrow I had to checkout and move to the Four Seasons up the block to get any work done..W S.F. you blew it with this designer u have chosen to do these rooms. You need to revamp it again...

<Content>Forewarned is best? I reserved with the W weeks in advance and was looking forward to a three nights stay in this reportedly upscale location. When we knew we would arrive late we called the hotel in advance, even though the room was guaranteed with a credit card, to be sure they did not give away our room. Upon arrival we discovered they were booked for the night (this was midnight after a very long drive) and that they were going to put us up at a hotel within walking distance. Have you ever been completely exhausted and had to walk down the street with the bellman who had your luggage on a cart? On the upside we stayed at an excellent location, the St. Regis...which I would highly recommend. They comped our room and parking..so the W tried to make amends. Late checkout at St. Regis before hiking back down the block was necessary due to meeting obligations...and was graciously arranged at the St. Regis.Upon re-arrival our room was not yet ready...so we left our bags with the bellman who took them up for us. The room at the W paled in comparison to the St. Regis, although the comparison was the issue. It was actually fairly well appointed with modern furnishings, comfortable beds, and a nicely updated bath (glass countertop, stainless sink, etc.). Our view was rather exceptional.There was no phone book in the room, no map of the hotel, no emergency evacuation map in the room...and the phone seemed standard and had no buttons marked for dialing up different services. The typical hotel traveler will find these items oddly absent. The phone issue was especially frustrating as their W book took a while to flip through to figure out who to call for what...just dial '0' and forget it!The location was superb, and here is where the W stands out. We were across the street from the convention center and next door to the museum of modern art. Shopping and cable car lines were a short walk from the hotel. We easily got down to Fisherman's wharf and then back up from Ghiradelli Square late in the evening on these lines.This was not a family location however. I travelled with my teenage son for a business meeting and was more than uncomfortable with the lobby area which was basically a bar and lounge. We found it necessary to enter the door closest to checkin desk and valet entrance to avoid having to pass through this very singles oriented atmosphere.A room decoration fell off the headboard and fortunately hit the unoccupied pillow during dinner...a real topper to some annoyances.Room service was fair, the coffee was good but I found it overpriced for the quality of food.We were given a complimentary cracker, fruit, and cheese plate as a gesture our first night's stay and received a written and in-person apology and offer of assistance.In sum, if you are comfortable with these arrangements I'd recommend it...as staying at the St. Regis was a pretty good exchange for the booking problems...but I would not recommend it for families.

<Content>Extremely Bad Customer Services O god. I can't believe I'm writing a BAD review for the W Hotel. I guess I've been spoiled by other W Hotel (W Montreal is the BEST)..Where should I start? BED - I guess one of my biggest disappointment is the W BED or lack there of? W is known for the W Bed (Fluffy White Cloud bed you just sink into it) So when I got to my room in SF for a business trip, I thought the bed was very typical, not the fluffy type bed at all. I didn't think much about it, since I haven't stay at a W for awhile, maybe they changed the bed. Then I actually looked at the mattress, it was a Sealy Beautyrest (Starwood). W Signature Bed is made by Simmons [--] I talked to the front desk, the supervisor assured me that was the W Bed (Simmons), but then changed her mind when I told her about the Sealy mattress. Then the guy do room setup told me that Sealy is the W Bed older version and they are in the process of updating to the new W Bed (Simmons) within the next 3 weeks. They offered to add a feather bed to make me feel better. So just to be sure, I called W SF again and asked them about the W Signature Bed, the guy confirmed with me that ALL the rooms have the LATEST version W Bed (Simmons). Well...I was going to buy W Signature Bed in SF. I guess I won't be buy it anymore. I wish they can all stick to one story, maybe I won't be as mad. CUSTOMER SERVICES--XYZ Bar - I called twice before my arrival to arrange a happy hour gathering at the XYZ bar, no one called me back. -Doorman-There was no one at the front door on Sunday, I had a couple luggage and it was hard to open the door and dragged them all in. -Upgrade-No upgrade (I'm Business Preferred Guest) They said they were all sold out, but somehow they were able to upgrade my co-workers room even they checked in after me. -Bed-They were going to give me some free points (enough for half a day stay-how generous) for the Bed situation. Nothing in my account yet. -Room-There was water dripping in the bathroom, they said the bathtub upstairs didn't work, that why it's leaking to our bathroom. ahhh---I feel much better now. I'm sure I sound like a real drama queen. I hope no one has to go through the same thing!At the time of check out and my many complaints, front desk person said she will credit my account with an additional HALF day worth of points (Why Half a day of points...I have no idea...Do they actually want me to stay again at a W for half a night? or they hope I will never stay at a W again?)7/24/2007 - Called back to the hotel front desk to find out why they never credited my account with the additional points...manager said he will call me back in a couple days after he follow up with the individuals. But I never got a call back. At this point, I'm not sure if I really want the point to stay at a W Hotel again.8/14/2007 - Called back to the hotel again, spoke with guest relationship manager, and explained to him about my complaints. He was extremely nice to listen to me blah blah blah. He said he will follow up with his staff, and he will credit my account with the additional points. I will update this again when the points hit my account. Maybe I will give this 2 stars!?

<Content>W SAn Francisco This is a cool Hotel true to the W brand. The W San Francisco is situated just perfectly for business or convention purposes straight across from Moscone. It's also a good home base if you want to just shop, tour, or visit the Museum. The public spaces are stylish and the Lobby attracts good looking --young-- locals too -so it's a nice mix of tourists, business people, and city dwellers. This property is definately geared towards a pretty specific age and interest group (sophisticated mostly mid 20's-40's singles or couples w/ no kids tagging along). It's all about hanging out to chill music and dim lighting. The rooms and bathrooms are attractive, comfortable, well thought out, but a bit small even by SF standards. Still a completely enjoyable property that is great fun and a decent value for a weekend in this wonderful city.

<Content>Not wonderful I used to be a tried and true W fan, and have stayed at both other W's (Montreal fantastic! Honolulu fun!) and the W San Fran before, but have to say this stay with the W San Fran was my last.The hotel has a great vibe and great location, but I think they have let it go to their heads. The rooms are very small, and very poor value for the price. In fact, I hated my first room so much (right above the fire station on Howard!!) that I used an upgrade to move to a suite. While initially impressed with the new decor (they are apparently renovating floor by floor - it is pan asian-whimsy and alot of fun), we realized quickly it's just alot of gloss and not much substance.The new room was also terribly noisy - both due to street noise and the ambient (can you say thumping) hallway music. The cleaning service was sporadic and poor - our sheets were stained on check in, it took three calls to get another pillow, and on the last day no cleaning at all!! Very disappointing to return to your room at midnight and find no clean towels and a messy bed.Service at the front desk? Non existent. Long line up to check out. Attitude from the bell staff. Ridiculous valet fee (46.50!!!). Overall - Don't bother. There are more chic and better hotels in San Francisco for your dollar. This W just doesn't measure up!

<Content>W Hotel is for me From the Pool to the outside patio to the great bars. I love this hotel. I always try to stay there when in San Francisco. Who knew I could see the Bloomingdales sign out my window box recliner in my room? The food has gotten better since I last stayed there and was very good.

<Content>Loved The W My daughter and I stayed her June-July 2006, it was wonderful! As soon as we arrived they upgrades us to a bigger room on a higher floor with a spectacular view! It's a great location, central to everything, close to Market st. We ordered room service twice, very good and quick. Great value for the money. Fantastic place to visit!

<Content>Not a typical W W is not as good as other W's in other cities. I have stayed at several and though the SF version is nice, I don't think it measures up to W standards.Pricey, so so location and SMALL rooms. A little dirty and compared to other W's, awkward.

<Content>(Not) Wild about the W I have stayed at the SF W over half a dozen times, and after an initial honeymoon period, I am starting to get annoyed and am not sure I'll stay there again.The location and accomodations have always been great. Convenient to downtown, the convention center, and the Ferry Terminal, the location is right for me, and although as another reviewer wrote, the stylings of the W have now been imitated so much that they seem more run-of-the-mill, I still find the accomodations comfortable. While 7 years ago, this was the only hotel where you could find such design, now there are at least a dozen within a few blocks, and what is more obvious is what is lacking. No flat screen TV, no coffee makers in the room, and no wireless internet in the rooms. Other kickers are the $45 / night parking, and the cooler-than-thou attidue of the front desk. Despite being a frequent visitor and a SPG preferred guest, we were afforded no love prior to our arrival. When we tried to book ajoining rooms for my 3 year old, 3 calls to the general manager went unanswered. We emailed the hotel and got a negative canned response from a Welcome Coach, who then did not respond to subsequent emails and voicemail messages. Eventually, we were given a guarantee for the room configurations we wanted, but upon check in, were given the rooms on the lowest possible floor (in my opinion, out of spite).The restaurant is very good for breakfast, and as noted in previous reviews, the valet staff are very helpful.In short, with all the competition in town and many places that look like an updated W, I would think the W would work a bit harder to please.

<Content>There are better places for this Price in SF Not impressed. For the price you can stay in a much better place. The lobby is tiny and so is the bar area. Not a very nice layout. Most hotels for this price have a grand entrance - NOT HERE. The room was cute but small. The food at the XYZ, which they seem to brag a lot about, was not all that. The filet migon was tiny (smaller than usual for a filet) not gourmet at all. The raviolis where practically empty inside and didn't have much flavor. The $8 water bottles are just ridiculous. And may I add don't even touch the $8 Pringles or anything in the mini bar for that matter. Overall, don't bother. Lots of chic but far from cheap. I wouldn't mind paying the hefty prices if I was getting what I paid for. By the way the $50 a day valet is crazy. You can park your car down the street in a secure garage for $18. Good Luck!

<Content>Sexiest Hotel in San Fran Flew out to San Fran with the girlfriend for a long weekend trip to visit some friends and attend a wedding near sacramento. Having enjoyed a business trip to the W in LA, I sought out the W in San Fran first. Very pleased to report that the W delivered well. Hotel is a beautiful downtown tower, about 30 stories tall and less than 10 yrs old. Classy looking exterior (while stone) and great location on 3rd across the street from the moscone center, metreon, sfmoma, and the yb gardens. Hotel itself has a very sexy vibe-lobby has cool lookingfurniture, the spa is Bliss, the female guests are [----] good looking, and the bar scenes at both XYZ and the W Cafe are strong. Will say that despite having reserved a king bed room, for the first night the best they could do was a double/double room, however they moved us into the proper room for the second night and moved our luggage during the day when we were out. Interesting thing I noticed is that while the rooms were pretty similar the king bed room had great CD player and a cordless phone, the double bedded room had a traditional hotel phone and the only way to play cd's was through thedvd player and television. that inconsistency surprised me. After a night at a bar nearby, we ordered room service- chicken tomato pizza and a 2002 pinot. Came in about 25 mins. excellent. Only dissapointment was the fact that high speed internet cost $15/day in the rooms. However, it was free wifi in the lobby. For a hotel like this with an obviously young and tech savvy clientelle- get with the program, free wifi all over is the way to go. enough of this BS.

<Content>Nice hotel, so-so location My boyfriend and I stayed at the W in San Francisco for two nights last week (he actually lives only a few miles from the hotel) after his work put him up for a big conference. The hotel room itself was very nice. We had a corner room on the 10th floor which provided an okay - but not spectacular - view. Our room looked just like the other pictures I've seen here, so I won't post pictures.The W San Francisco lobby and bar are very trendy, and we enjoyed the XYZ bar a lot. Nice layout and decor, though - as expected - drinks and food cost an arm and a leg.The location of the W San Francisco is not exceptional. Apart from SFMOMA and the Yerba Buena Gardens, I'm not sure much else is nearby. I suppose it is ideal for a business traveler, but if I were coming to San Francisco for leisure, I'd much prefer to stay in a different neighborhood with a little more life/culture. I will say that the valet staff were exceptional - though I am noting this due to the fact that we had a problem with our car when it was returned from the valet (the window was busted - and I do mean busted!). They took care of everything for us and made the experience as painless as possible, which I definitely appreciated.This was my first stay at a W hotel, so I can't compare it to others within the chain; however, I would definitely consider staying at a W again, especially in another city where the hotel might sport a better location. I'd recommend this hotel if you can get a room in the $200-$250 a night range; if you're paying $500 a night (which TripAdvisor lists as the average cost), I think you're much better off looking around.

<Content>Mediocre at best  After staying at several W Hotels, I decided to book a stay at the W San Francisco for a vacation. My room which cost $500/ night was completely unremarkable, especially in a hotel chain that prides itself in excellence. The room was small, cramped, and in need of a complete update. The furnishings were old and heavily worn, the bathrooms were small and dated, and not nearly as pristine as shown in the pictures. I asked to be moved to a different room, and they happily moved me, but it was just as bad. The bellman told me that they were soon to start remodeling the rooms, as they have been like that for over 8 years. The service was okay, but not remarkable. On the up side, the beds in the rooms are very comfortable, and the hotel lobby, bar and restaurant have an up-beat lively vibe. Overall, the stay was a bit of a dissappointment, especially given my recent previous experiences at Starwood properties. I would reccomend staying at the St Regis, which is only a block away, where you are sure not be dissapointed.

<Content>Chillout in San Francisco I stayed here for a week on business, between April 7th -14th. From the moment i stepped in to checking out, the service has been second to none. Staff are friendly and totally sincere, which is such a change when you travel a lot on business.The hotel itself is well situated for the Moscone convention centre and the main shopping district in downtown San Francisco, it is immediately next door to the SF Museum of Modern ArtThere is a small gym, spa and rooftop pool with hot tub, all tastefully arrangedThe business centre is functional, and again staff there were very helpful.Rooms are well equiped, and a descent size, I had a pretty standard room, but it had CD player and DVD player.In short a superb high end spec. hotel, suitable for business, family holidays, etc. and weekend breaks.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel! Stayed at the W Hotel thsi past weekend (March 16-8), which happened to be St. Patricks Day weekend! We had an excellent time. This was our first time staying at the W San Francisco, although we have been to their cocktail lounge and bar before.We stayed in a Fabulous Corner Room on the 24th floor. The room was average sized, with a very comfortable bed and pillows. Bathroom was average sized as well, but very nice. Very modern contemporary furnitings throughout. We had a nice view of the city, although it wasn't great. We looked down at the Museum of Modern Art, which is right next door. The opposite side might have a better view, possibly an ocean view.We ordered room service twice. Although a little pricey, service was prompt and food was good. Would order again!We did not try the restaurant, pool, or Spa. However, we did frequent the bar and lounge often! They have a very good selection of drinks, and the bartender Clay is excellent. Very good cutomer service skillls. We tried a few of the martinis. They were very good although I cannot remeber the names. The concierge was very helpful both nights as well. They recommended awsome restaurants both times and made reservations. The first night we went to Frisson, which is in the Finacial District; we highly recommend it! The second night we had sushi at Ozumo, near the Embarcadero. Again, excellent place and would recommend it to anyone.We had a great stay at the W. Hope to stay there again soon!

<Content>Be wary! Stayed for four nights on a business trip and was impressed with the size of the room etc. However, I found there was some rather foul stains (females staying along do not make marks like that) on the duvet cover, which obviously had not been washed - told the hotel staff and it was rectified but I received no apology etc. Really not acceptable in a hotel aiming to be top tier and fairly disgusting. So check your bedsheets before climbing into bed there.

<Content>Not for all business travellers On the positive side, this is a great hotel in a perfect location for the Moscone Centre. It's just a bit too far from Union Square to be convenient though. The staff were very helpful and friendly, service was excellent and the place was immaculate and well maintained. However, unless you like thumping house music in the lobby and new age music in the elevator lobby at 7 in the morning, it may not be for you. Other minor inconveniences make it a little less business-friendly than other chains, such as closets with insufficent room to hang your clothes and too few coat hangers. For the sheer convenience of being across the road from Moscone, I'll probably go back as the rates are reasonable compared to the nearby hotels of the same class. But as a tourist, I would pick something around Union Square. As a business traveller, it wouldn't be my first choice if I needed to be somewhere besides the convention centre.

<Content>Ok, but not great Stayed at the W in early February. Check in was fine, but while we requested a non-smoking room, we were put into a smoking room. You could smell the smoke through the deodoriser. The room was nice, large, great air/heating, but the furniture is starting to show signs of wear and tear. Very fast internet connection.Room service needsa lot of work, the menu selection is tiny.An ok hotel for business, very convenient if you are attending a conference at the Moscone center. Will try the St regis next time though.

<Content>Try the St. Regis We stayed 3 nights in early January for a mini holiday.Check in was easy; we had a late arrival and received immediate attention. Valet service was prompt during the entire stay. The room itself was lovely; spotlessly clean and with a beautiful view of the bay. (There is ongoing construction that threatens to block this view in the future). Found the usual amenities in a W - Bliss products, two soft robes, blow dryer, mini-fridge, coffee maker and a range of DVDs for rent downstairs. All were in working order. I was sick during the stay and found the whatever, whenever service fantastic when I needed Tylenol at 2 A.M. and didn't want to leave the hotel to find a drugstore. On that note, I really needed a quiet night's sleep and was disappointed to hear noisy, intoxicated guests in the hall on Fri./Sat. night. In addition, every morning the maids let the doors slam going in and out of the rooms across the hall making it impossible to sleep.Concierge service was very slow. I asked for directions which one woman said she was printing for me. I waited to the side while she helped other guests and after 5 minutes she asked What did you need again?The music played throughout the hotel offers the trendy, nightlife ambiance the W is known for, yet on a Sunday morning the same music and blue lights in the hallway give the hotel a garish feeling.Yes, the location next to MOMA is great and you can walk to Union Square, but next time I'll stay at the St. Regis.

<Content>Hectic in the lobby; quiet in the rooms We loved our room -- one of the cool corner rooms with a fantastic view of the Bay Bridge from our extremely comfortable bed. With its charming window seat and lack of noise, this was a real urban oasis. . . . . .where we desperately needed to regroup to prepare for the hustle and bustle of the lobby. It was quite the scene on a Saturday night, which can be good or bad depending on your mood.Getting in and out of the hotel required a lot of effort. Check-in procedures at the busy front desk were intense (designed to prevent fraud, which is fine, but is it really a problem for my husband to use his credit card to pay for the room even though the hotel points go to my account?). Picking up our car from the valet service seemed like a chore in the overcrowded drive-through.All of this would have been unbearable if not for the warm attitude of the staff -- and the feeling that somehow you were cool for subjecting yourself to the rigors.

<Content>Awesome as usual If you like W hotels, you'll love this one. We stayed 3 nights and experienced great food at XYZ, a free room upgrade, and great service. We would stay here again for sure. Also, they allow pets. The hotel is immaculate also.The pool area is small but very nice. The rooftop area is nice but can be windy-- be sure to bring a jacket. The hotel is just steps from the Museum of Modern Art-- a wonderful place to visit.

<Content>W Gets a 'D' Two words describe our experience: annoying and disappointing. Let me elaborate. On the evening of Saturday 27th, our first night there, one of the guests on the 25th floor had two male visitors who were conducting an extraordinarily loud and rude conversation in the hallway that startled us out of a deep sleep. We called management to complain but as no one came up to handle the matter, I eventually had to get up and step into the hallway where I politely asked that the two guys keep it down. At that point they mocked my request so I closed the door and again called the front desk. Prior to security finally appearing, the two males apparently left but not before one last insult at our door of 鈥榮tupid queers鈥?followed by derisive laughter. Not a great tone for sleep. Encountering belligerent and potentially dangerous drunken outsiders in the hallway where I鈥檓 spending over $300 per night is annoying. The too late appearance of your security was disappointing. Adding insult to injury, the next morning's overpriced, tasteless and cold egg omelet breakfast was perhaps the worst hotel meal we've ever had. This hotel may be perfect for the uninitiated traveler or the nightlife crowd, but, based on my experiences here, I doubt that we will ever stay with this hotel chain again.

<Content>Fantastic Weekend - Incredible Service!! We had an amazing stay at the W SF. We had not stayed at a W property before. We heard it was hip and unique and unlike most hotels. I had contacted the concierge desk a week prior to our arrival. Meagan was fantastic in making all of our reservations from airport pick up to dinner and spa reservations. She emailed our intinerary to us a few days before our arrival.We had a large, upper floor suite which was well appointed and spacious. We had ordered room serivce a few times and, while a bit pricey (as expected), the food was good and quick to the room. The rooms are showing a bit of age but they are very clean. The decor is modern and unique for a hotel. The city views were amazing!The service at the Bliss spa was great. We were immediately taken in for our treatments. The locker room attendent was very helpful. After our treatments the general manager introduced herself and made sure we were taken care of.We ate in the in hotel gourmet restaurant XYZ. The food and service were great.We will definitely be back for a stay at the W!!

<Content>W could possibly stand for WORST, or What the heck?!? I atteneded the 2007 Macworld conference and decided to say at the W Hotel, San Fran first because of the W reputation, and second because of location. Because of flight changes I had arrived 1 day early and the W staff was more than accomodating to help me settle into a room, unfortunately they wanted to bill the entire stay to my credit card upfront not a big deal except for the fact that it was over $2000 for 4 nights. For that much money I want to be sure my stay is effortless and relaxing. The quality I would expect from a Starwood hotel was much less for example, the shower bar was rusting, with spots all over the curtian. When I called the front desk to ask if there were changing areas at the gym they put me on hold because they did not know only to hang up on the call. The hvac system was making a loud clunking noise at 3am each night, and when someone came to fix it they looked at the wall and stated this is the way it sounds. Did I mention the room size which is partially taken up by a CRT television? If you are looking for luxury don't spend you money here, go to the St. Regis right up the street.

<Content>Fun on New Year's We stayed here over the 12/31/06 NYE...even staying on points they upgraded us to a room w/ a beatiful bay view...already had plans for NYE, but stopped by the W's party which they comp'ed us tickets for (they were charging $90/ticket for this) which was well presented and looked like people were having a good time. Only downside was a bar tab was mistakenly attached to our bill and took 30 min for them to address when we were trying to leave.Love the location of this place though. An easy 2-3 block walk to any of the major SF shopping dining hotspots..

<Content>good for partying This hotel is great for partying young people. The bar there is really cool and the hotel looks very modern. It is not my style, since it is a bit cold and dark, but I am sure many people enjoy the view. You can even buy the things in the room

<Content>above average but only because of their friendly staff The rooms need renovating in order to remain a four class hotel but everything else was up to par.The gym has good tread mills for jogging. Bliss has great service but one complaint: when getting a facial, I really don't want the staff to try to force their products on me. It is the same everywhere, different spa, different recommendations. Of course, they only recommend their products and they speak badly about the products that you are presently using. It is just irritating when all you want to do is relax.

<Content>A Good Stay, but may try elsewhere next time My husband and I stayed a the W for 7 days. Initially, I found it difficult to communicate and make sure it was noted with the staff about our needs for late arrival and late checkout. Even though I called several times, I am a double/triple checker!, there seemed to be no indication of this on record. Upon arriving very late at night, the W lived up to its cool and clubby atmosphere. The XYZ bar was not a disturbance and has a nice crowd each evening without being overwhelming to the hotel enviroment. The W hotel staff was very young in their 20's and a bit pretentious. Its the W, what can I say. Our room was an upgraded room which meant, we were on a higher floor. We had a king size bed but it is smaller than a real king size. The room itself was small and a bit worn out. A nice feature was the cushioned window bench overlooking a great view and the bliss products in our room. I tipped the hotel cleaning staff each day and left a little note to receive more bath products. After going to the Bliss spa in the hotel, I saw the 6 pack of goodies we get in our rooms sells for $25! at Bliss. It was well worth the little extra I added to the tip each day. Everything in the hotel is very expensive...a Voss water bottle goes for $8. I recommend finding the closest Walgreens, which there are many around that area, and loading up on some munchies and water. There is also a liquor store nearby on 3rd and Mission (across the street) where you can stock up on spirits too. Hotel is located within a 5 minute walk to Market Street, the main street where you can get on virtually any bus. The area is quieter than Union Square but a 10 min walk gets you to Union Square for shopping. 2 blocks away is the Metreon movie theater. Overall, W location was great given our activities. OH..parking is $45. If you plan on renting a car and not touching it for a few days, move your car to the SOMA parking garage, 3 minutes away, for $20 a night parking. The valets from the W park you car here anyway. Only problem is the garage closes daily at 11pm. I highly recommend buying the PASSPORT for the Muni system. They are hard to find but you can get them at Union Sq. right where the Hyde-Powell cable car turns around. Also, buy the Muni map for $6 at Walgreens which gives you all the information you need to get around the Muni system. Overall, we enjoy modern decor but after 7 days we missed the more homey traditional style hotels like the Hyatt. The W hotels halls and elevator waiting areas are dark and their is lounge music playing 24/7. Even we had our limits. Hotel looked like it needed some updates. Location, window seat, and bath products compensated. May return or will try the Westin St Francis at Union Square. Right in the hustle and bustle.

<Content>Uber Urban Hip... AND Relaxing! What took us so long to try The W San Francisco?! We loved it, and we've stayed in A LOT of San Francisco hotels over the past few years.From check-in to check-out, the staff were as wonderful as the W promises (including the staff at the Bliss Spa, who probably are not employed by the W). Our corner room was like a mini apartment, with a great bed, plenty of window seating (little couches with comfy pillows), a big bathroom with quality amenities, a big desk w/ nice chair, and great attention to detail. Hip additions include a personalized wake-up call, Bliss bath products, windows with plantation shutters, and a CD/DVD player playing the W's up-tempo lounge music upon your arrival. The common areas are great, too -- makes you never want to leave the hotel. And super-cool tiny treats in the lobby (Was it just for the holiday season?): one afternoon it was hot cocoa, later at night it was a s'mores bar, and the next day it was hot mint green tea with extras to add in (cloves, orange peels, sugar chunks).Great location in the heart of SF, so you can easily walk to lots of art, shopping, touristy places, the bay, and some of the many great restaurants. A cab ride to the rest of the most popular places/neighborhoods will usually stay under $10.The biggest negative about The W San Francisco: almost 50 bucks per night to park the car. Come on!

<Content>Ground zero for night life and entertainment The mood is mellow yet powerful. The scene is young and hip. The food and drink is what every young urbanite dreams of. The rooms are modern, refined. Music plays as you enter your new digs. Bose wave radio and fridge full of snacks, alcohol, and other fun stuff are all included. Location is perfect. If you're looking to stay where the scene lays, post up here. It's worth every penny.

<Content>How did I get in Nazi Germany? ... Oh wait, its just the bar at the W The service at the bars, both downstairs and the XYZ, is the worst I have experienced in my several years of functional alcoholism. The weekend I stayed was probably one of the busiest weekends in San Francisco during the year, with both USC and UCLA in the area playing football games against Stanford and Cal, respectively. The management had the brilliant idea to staff only two bartenders at each location to serve the 300-400 people that came out for the bar scene on Saturday Night. One of my friends (a very attractive girl who one would expect might get immediate attention from a bartender) asked how much longer it would take to get a drink after she had already been waiting for twenty minutes. His exact words, Well now you have to wait longer for mouthing off you [--]. Unfortunately she did not have her pepper spray with her to give him the propert retort. Our complaints to the manager fell on deaf ears as we saw the manager having a good chuckle with the offending bartender after we complained. My suggestion, if you're going to go: Stiff everybody on the tips and steal some of the glassware to make up for the exorbitant prices and reprehensible service.Other than that the rooms were pretty small but well appointed with a modern touch and the location was a little too far south of Market.

<Content>Very disappointed We recently stayed at the W in San Francisco and were really disappointed. My Fiance and I were there to celebrate our engagement and when we arrived we were told the room we had booked was unavailable and they promised to have us moved for the second night. We were given a very small room with two double beds. No one from the hotel contacted us about moving and when my Finace inquired about it, the front desk staff was very rude and told her that there was no note on our file about moving us and sometimes they overbook rooms and our room wasn't confirmed (the clerk who told us he marked the file saw my Fiance and went into the back behind the curtain to hide). After threatening to escalate the situation, they found a room to move us into (which took over a 1/2 hour to switch). We asked the concierge for assistance with a medical situation and they never returned our call (after promising to have the information ready when we checked in). The bell desk was very slow and not very eager to assist anyone. Rooms are significantly smaller (both living area and bathrooms) than the W in Seattle and not nearly as nice. Saving graces, as with all of the Westin chain, is the bed which was great and the restaurant/room service staff was good

<Content>Really enjoyed this hotel! What a fun hotel! If you have never stayed at a W hotel, you might be in for a suprise. This hotel pretty much embodies the W brand concept. As expected, the location was awesome (right next to all the shopping/dining). The checkin was flawless and we were given a room with unbelievable views on the 25th floor. The room was very nice, and had satelite radio, CD player, etc.. There was also a great big window seat you could stretch out on and peer out at the great view. Overall the rooms are great (they are upgrading them next year as they are 7 years old, but they are still in good shape).As for the service -- the common areas are very cool, with chill music playing and a dark, sort of club like atmosphere. The concierge (which W refers to as Whatever/Whenever) is top notch. They can do just about anything, just ask (like get us into the fully booked resturaunts, find an ENT doctor lickety split, etc..). They're just quality conierges, and W prides themselves on that.Now, here's where your parents might get a little freaked out. At about 8PM, the large lobby area which is scattered with lots of cool seating arrangments (which W calls the Living Room) changes into a club. So, say you go out for dinner and come back to the hotel at 10. Open the doors to the hotel and you are in a fully packed (with beautiful 20/30 somethings) living room. There is a DJ playing chill type music. There is a large bar that is full, and hopping. There are people mingling, eating (from their XYZ resturaunt) which is very good. Overall, just very busy. I like that -- you may not. To summarize this, we went out one night and talked to some locals at a club. They asked Why are you HERE if you're staying at the W? We proceeded to all go back to the Hotel to party. Take from this what you want -- there's another door you can enter to skip the nightly parties. But they're fun and very professional. I loved it and am going to try to stay at a W whenever the city I'm in has one.

<Content>Thin Walls, Small Rooms, and dated decor My husband's company selected this hotel as the location for their annual trip. The overall experience was okay. However, the walls were so thin that we could hear our neighbor flush his toilet, cough, take a shower, his radio, his phone conversation, his TV, and his radio. This was not a good experience when you are extremely tired from a long day of walking. The rooms were very small for the high price that was paid. The bathroom was very small. I for one am not a fan of modern decor, but based on the 4 other hotels that we have stayed at in San Fran I was not at all impressed with this dated decor.The pluses were their service for laundry cleaning and housekeeping.Based on the good points and the other comments, I would definitely NOT return to this hotel.

<Content>Decent hotel but small room My wife and I stayed at the W July 17th through the 20th. The W's gimmic is to be kind of trendy in a New Agey sort of way. The room was very small but the window seat is a nice spot to look out over the city. The bathroom is fairly large and well equipped. Pray you don't drop a contact or something in the hallway as they are lit with these funky blue lights so you really can barely navigate to the elevators. The majority of the staff are knowledeable and quite eager to serve. We ate at both the XYZ and the Cafe and were pleased with the quality of the food and the service (even though compared to restaurants in the neighborhood the prices were quite high). The W is located in the southern end of the Financial District, a short walk to Union Square and ATT Park (home of the Giants) and is across the street from the Moscone Center. If the location is nearby something you are interested in the W would be a decent choice but if you are in San Francisco to see the sights there are better choices.

<Content>Great hotel with an ideal location... My husband and I stayed at the W Hotel July 27 - 31st. As soon as we walked into the hotel, we were immediatley pleased with the modern and trendy decor along with aromas of Guava. It smelled so good that we even ordered the candles (Bluewick - Guava). The front desk were helpful and allowed us to check in early and our room was upgraded. We had spectacular views of the Bay Bridge and the city (although the smog made it less visible at times). Ray, the morning/mid afternoon concierge, was most helpful. He recommended two great restaurants - Osha (Thai) which was located about a block away and Le Colonial (French/Vietnamese) which is further but within town. Ray also arranged our car rental to drive to Napa Valley and addressed any issues/questions during our stay with professionalism. We suggest future visitors to NOT rent a car during their stay in San Fran. due to parking rates. It is more cost effective to rent a car daily (which range b/w $39 - 59) so not to pay the $45 parking fee. Our rental was dropped off and picked up at the hotel, which was very convienent. The rooms were very clean, quiet and comfortable although a bit small. We enjoyed the location, away from the busyiness of Union Square (and, the homeless people) though within walking distance. It was great walking into the market area after eating dinner. The Farmer's Market at the Ferry Building was well worth visiting. We found the Fisherman's Warf very touristy. We really enjoyed a tour through Super Sightseeing Tours. We chose a combo tour which included Muir Woods, Sausilito, and Alcatraz - well worth going. Overall, our stay at the W was WONDERFUL! The only negative is during happy hour/evening hours at the XYZ, you feel untrendy walking through the seating area/entrance hall due to all the hip people drinking martinis and listening to W music. It would have been nice if they had a seperate area to socialize rather than in the center of the hotel, especially when you want to sit and relax after a long day. At times, it was difficult to talk to the concierge due to the high volume of the music and people talking. Besides that one negative, we truly enjoyed our visit at the W and the Bliss products in our room were a bonus.

<Author>just up and go
<Content>San Francisco cool I was in San Francisco on business and at the last minute decided to stay an extra day. I had been staying at another hotel that is known for its business-friendly prices, but not for its conveniences (and because my company wouldn't pay for anything else). I booked through the Starwood preferred guest program and got a great rate on a corner king room. I arrived early in the morning expecting to simply store my bags, but to my delight, my room was ready. From the early check-in until the minute I left, I was more than pleased with this hotel. The room was huge and so comfortable. If I had any criticism, it's that there were a lot of 20-somethings running around late at night -- there are a lot of great bars and clubs in the area and apparently the W is something of a base for hipsters and wannabe hipsters. Also, beware of the bottle of Voss water on the night table - you will be charged $10. No matter what the room rate, this should be complimentary.

<Content>Good Hotel,Nice Location This W Hotel is a chic, modern and trendy hotel at a good location. It is pricey, but the rooms are nice, clean and well maintained. However, the housekeeping servicesneeds to be improved since they do not bother themselves even putting back to its place in the closet an ironing board which you used the night before. I had a night experience at XYZ restaurant and it was well worth the money. I recommend this hotel.

<Content>Expensive but nice Great location but expensive. You'd think Starwood members would get a better deal. Definitely visit clubs and restaurants outside the hotel for better meals and service. Get a room away from the elevator as it can be very noisy. Parking of $20+ is a rip off!

<Content>W is expensive, but very good Stayed here on a business trip for a few days and I gotta say it was great. We arrived really late at around 1am and I was being given a smoking room and I asked for a non-smoking one and they sorted it out in minutes. My room was a corner room and it had a great view. The bed was massive, the workdesk quite good and there was a this nice couch sort of thing below one of the windows, which was nice to relax in. A very comfy room it has to be said. The bathroom was really big, which sort of seems to differentiate a great hotel from a regular one. The amenities were nice.Roomservice burger was mighty fine and the internet connection (cable) really fast. The check in people were really friendly and the location is great. There's a strip club next door if you are into that sort of thing, the Moscone center is close, there's an superb Mexican restaurant close, an IHOP, Mel's Diner etc...good location. The hotels waiters are all rather beefy and wear tight clothing which was a bit...erm unnerving and they werent very friendly, but the breakfast was absolutely awesome.

<Content>Cinco de Mayo OLE! Had a great three day stay at the W. Upon check in I was recognized as a returning guest and received a beautiful corner room on the 21st floor with a delightful view of the Bay Bridge. Room was spacious with two 2 person couches and a large hassock. Plenty of room to entertain my family. Breakfast and dinner at the hotel's restaurant XYZ were a treat. Great service and wine list. I ordered the price fixe Artichoke Dinner with wine and was impressed by the meals balance,flavor and presentation. My family also enjoyed their meals. On Sunday morning I treated my niece and sister in law to massages at the Bliss Spa we all enjoyed our experiences. The hotels staff are highly motivated to make sure guests are happy with their stay. The hotel is expensive, but deals are available on the hotel's web site. I will definitely be back.

<Content>Well its okay... I really wanted to title this review W stands for... but couldn't find an appropraite word for average beginning with W....From the time I arrived at this hotel until the time I left I was comfortable. And thats about it.Our taxi drew up and the first thing that strikes you as you walk in is the pleasant smell, and cool, dark atmosphere. Now when I say cool I don't mean it in the Fonz sense. The crowd was ageing businessman. What I mean is the temperature was cool and refreshing.Check in highlighted the first major problem. Parlez anglais? My partner and I are British. We speak clearly, we have no funny accents or colloquialism's yet everytime we approached the front desk we found ourselves repeating everything we said. No where else did we encounter this problem except at this hotel. I can only think that they weren't listening the first time round....needless to say this was tedious and made the checking in process drawn out.Our room was on the seventh floor, just above the pool area. Not a bad location and the sound proofing was good. The room itself had two double beds, a large TV with CD player etc, coffee maker with selection of Tazo teas and W blend coffee, a large desk area and a comfy day bed. Here there were some nice touches; quality dressing gowns, Bliss spa products in the bathroom (and the Maids replenish generously!), a good selection of pillows on the beds and a day bed by the window to relax on.It is all very comfortable and I had no complaints. Ok, so the phone didn't work properly. After a protacted exchange with the front desk, where we had to repeat had to repeat had to repeat what we were asking for, it was fixed within a day.Now for the rest of the hotel...Both of us wanted to check out the gym and were pleasantly surprised. The emphasis here is on cardio. There are about 4 treadmills, all fitted with tv screens, a couple of bikes, crosstrainers and a selection of free weights, yoga mats and ab balls. Jet lag meant that we were down there at 5am. It seemed to get busy at 6am so time your visit carefully.Bliss is adjacent to the gym (both on the fourth floor). Now I am not a big Bliss fan but I did try and find out if they had any massage appointments available and they didn't. If you feel like spending $120 on a facial then make sure you book ahead. We didn't eat in the hotel for dinner but we did have breakfast in the XYZ (gettit?) restaurant one morning. I was thoroughly underwhelmed. Ordered cappuccino which came in a cup that I can only describe as Dolly sized. The fruit salad was okay but anyone can chop up melon, drizze Vanilla yoplait over the top and charge $13+ can't they? Mentally decided never to bother with that again....as an aside they have a less format buffet just outside XYZ and this looked better. Muffins, cereals, bagels and a barista are on hand to deliver a quick breakfast.The hotel is located in a decent area. They are lots of casual dining options nearby, you can walk to Union Square in less than ten minutes and it feels safe round there. Plus art lovers will love the fact that Moma is next door.Now to the rating. The W is a good hotel - but its not great. It charges high prices and bills itself as a cool hotel. But the fact is, it just misses the mark. I feel that it was probably at the top of its game 5 years ago. Now the convention crowd have moved in and the coolness quotient has moved on.

<Content>Comfortable Hotel, Wonderful Service The W provided comfortable accomodations, reliable and friendly service along with extra touches throughout my stay. (Everything from Hot Cider at check-in to fortune cookies at night). Rooms are small, yet pricey. CD and DVD player included in rooms was easy to use and wonderful. Hotel offers complimentary use of CDs and DVDs during your stay via the Front Desk. Pool (Refered to as Wet) is small, yet very clean. Excercise Room (reffered to as Sweat) recived and equipment upgrade during my stay. Overall, great service and comfortable rooms yet pricey. I will return next time I am in San Fran.

<Content>April 2006 I recently stayed at the W SF while on business. I have stayed here a few times and this was one of my most pleasant stays. Staff was friendly... they can be a bit on the conceded side and the bed was as wonderful as ever. The gym was recently upgraded with new state of the art, touch screen cardio equipment. They retained the free weights, but got rid of the universal gym. The stay was nice over all. I would stay here again.

<Content>Style and Quality in a Great Hotel The W is the place to be in San Fran. From the ultra-hip XYZ bar to the hotties at the front desk, this place rocks! The staff looked at my Gold Card and preferred guest status and immediately put me in a corner room, view of the Golden Gate and all!! The room was ultra-comfortable with a fantastic bed, cool desk, little sofa in the window, and a big tv. The room had a perfectly controlled environment, nice temp and not too dry. The gym is hip with a glass ceiling over the pool and plenty of cool music. The quality exceeded my expectations. Example, Sundays are not good days to print a document since nobody can open the business center. The concierge dude had me send it to him by email and he printed it at no cost. When I got back from dinner there was a bottle of Sonoma red waiting for me with an apology for the printing problems. Can you beat that? Free printing and a free bottle of CA's best!! Wow!! Way cool!!!The bar hosts tons of people who are worth watching. Even the drunk from TransAmerica with the martinis was a hoot. Stay if you can and enjoy it, it's all worth it, and it's all good!

<Content>exactly what you'd expect from a W Great location (next door to MOMA, downtown and commercial - not an area with great San Francisco residential character), small rooms with great beds and shower heads, helpful concierge for restaurant reservations and directions. I can understand those who might feel out of place not wearing all black and being over 30-something, but we had a perfectly good experience there - being people who are 30-something and do wear a fair amount of black. We did not avail ourselves of any additional and probably overpriced services, such as the minibar, spa, or parking, and therefore were satisfied with the value we received.

<Content>10 out of 10 until check-out.......... I would have given this hotel a 10 out of 10 but unfortunately, I was treated horribly upon check-out. I received no offers of help or understanding when my suitcase broke and the shuttle was waiting downstairs. A female concierge was rude and unhelpful and the lady at the front desk wasn't any better. When I checked in, a male whose name I have forgotten was very kind and upbeat. Too bad he wasn't there when I checked out.I liked the spa because it was bright and clean and when I received a massage/facial the lights were dimmed. I do think that they are overpriced however.I liked the room and the view and I also loved that when you entered your room, they had the music box playing...I loved the CD so much that I bought it.Room service was fast and efficient and very delicious as well.The french martinis at XYZ are great. Overall, I had a very nice time and will stay at a W again.

<Content>Had a great time at the W My husband and I recently stayed at the W hotel for about 5 days. We were in SF for a wedding and to see family and friends for the holidays. We had an awesome time at this hotel, and no problems whatsoever with the staff! They were gracious and friendly, and went out of their way to help us out when asked.It IS a bit trendy and I think that it caters to a younger crowd..that is what we liked about it, though! Of course, like any hotel, you have to be careful about grabbing that bottled water next to your bed or anything from the minibar. We found that there were plenty of places in the area to grab a drink and lots of great places to eat nearby or a quick cab ride away. My girlfriend and I spent some time in the bliss spa located in the building, and although it is expensive, had a great experience there as well. We also had dinner and breakfast in the XYZ restaurant and the food was yummy, too. All in all, the hotel IS pricey, but I really don't think you'll find much for less in the city. We thought the quality was worth it.

<Content>Gouge-A-Rama We stayed at the W San Francisco from December 17th through the 26th. It was not our first stay at the hotel, and we previously had a very favorable opinion of it. Not anymore. Let's begin with the shameless manner in which the W San Francisco charges for incidentals. There are all kinds of nasty hidden surprises. One example is a $10 to $30 and up package handing fee to bring boxes or packages from the hotel loading dock to the guest room. This includes FedEx packages. Then there's the $1 per page incoming fax fee. I can understand recouping a reasonable sum for ink and paper and even making a reasonable profit but at that rate I could have purchased my own fax machine over the duration of my stay. All seasoned travelers know that minibars are an unholy rip-off. But the W San Francisco gives new meaning to this term. The price list next to the snack goodies breaks out the costs, but you must look very closely at the fine print; there is a 20% restocking fee tacked on to the numbers listed. This is very easy to miss and a very immoral business practice. I awoke, very thirsty in the middle of our first night, so I grabbed the water the hotel had conveniently set next to my bed. Sure, they've got fancy artesian water in the room, and again, I would expect a reasonable premium for this. Well, the W San Francisco seems to have no problem charging guests $8 a bottle ... that's right folks, EIGHT bucks for a lousy 12-oz. Bottle of water. Then there was the night we wanted a stiff drink before bed. We sauntered over to the W bar for two long island iced teas. I was in total disbelief when I saw the bartender concoct a drink consisting of about 90% sour mix, 5% Coke, and maybe 5% alcohol for $10 each. I am not exaggerating one bit. It was totally undrinkable. Parking ... again, I understand their need to charge a lot. After all, the location is prime real estate and they've got a valet staff to pay. Most garages in the area charge around $250 a month for self-parking. The garage down the street charges $22 per night. So, hey, $30 or $35 wouldn't be so bad with all those full service valet guys. But no. The W San Francisco seems to think that $90 every two nights is perfectly okay to charge people for PARKING. Oh, and be careful if you decide to park off property and use the valet to run up to your room for five minutes because the hotel will tack on $14 plus tax to your room bill. Some readers may be thinking yeah yeah... this guy is just upset because he spent more money than he could afford at an expensive hotel. I only wish that were true, because I'd have far less of a problem. The truth is, we found many of the hotel's staff to be both rude and unresponsive. Now don't get me wrong here. There were many very helpful and friendly folks. But we found that a handful of people working the front desk were the reliably slow and unfriendly. We noticed this was a pattern more than just a few isolated incidents. Oh, and remember the package delivery fees, and the $1 fax pages? Let's talk about those for a moment. I sent a FedEx package for Saturday delivery at a huge expense to ensure its timely arrival. I arrived on Sunday night and asked for it upon check-in. Three different people insisted the package was not at the hotel after repeated requests to locate it. It was not until I could contact the shipping clerk at my company on Monday morning to prove that the package had in fact arrived on Saturday that I was able to retrieve it. The same goes for the faxes... I could only get them delivered by repeatedly badgering the front desk staff, and only then would they send them up. In one instance, a fax sat downstairs for nearly two hours before it was brought up to my room after repeated requests.Overpriced and spotty service. That's enough to keep me away for a good long time, but the discomfort of the guest room really put the whole experience over the top. The mattress was hard as a rock. After five days, my companion developed deep dark rings around his eyes from inability to sleep. I'm not sure if this was just isolated to my room but it was hugely disappointing. You'd think with all the money generated from the $8 water bottle sales and $45.60 parking fees and other annoying nickel and dime fees that they'd at least keep the beds in good shape. The pool area is in need of a facelift with dirty, worn pool cushions, and the treadmills are older base models. Bottom line, this hotel is a terrible value.There are so many great hotels in San Francisco. Why waste your time and money being uncomfortable at the W?

<Content>The Spa looks like a hospital The W Hotel was not my first choice for accomodations in San Fran, but I got a great rate so I thought I would give it a try. I have stayed at a W in Manhattan, so I knew what to expect. Here is a summary:On the Positive Side: the gym is nice and they have cool music pumped in there and the pool (indoor and heated). Its very clean and there are tvs at alot of the machines. There is free cold water and nice towels. - The room was what you can expect from a W - modern and a bit worn. The TV was a flat screen. The bathroom is very average. The Bliss products in the room are a nice touch.- The doorman and the front guest employees were upbeat and professional. The room service was OK but pricey. - THE WORST THING about this hotel is the very eery Spa. I booked a massage the first night I was there and when I got down there to check in I wanted to run the other way. The entrance to the Spa is lit with hideous and very COLD colored lights - flouresent. The mood is rockin and cold. The music is technojazzy - not slow and spa like. So I decide not to run the other way - but just to keep an open mind and get my massage... The locker room was worse than my high school locker room - chilly and brightly lit and, again, COLD. The waiting room was COLD, the massage room had lights that shined in your eyes.... the place has a huge hospital vibe to it. I have been to spas all over the world and this place was WIERD. talk about feeling like you are in a dressing room and the lights are making you look bad. It was hard to relax. The massage was good - but i would NEVER go back.If I were over 50 I think I would hate it there. Lots of people wearing black hanging out in the lobby. Stay there ONLY if you get a great deal.

<Content>Perfection... My visit to San Francisco is was simply outstanding while staying at the W Hotel. Great location, however I recommend taking cabs, opposed to parking at the hotel. The staff was very nice and prompt to my every need,the room was clean and had modern funiture and stocked with Bliss Products from the Bliss Spa downstairs, which is a must do. I ordered room service during my weekend stay and had some of the best Duck I'd ever tasted! Even the wine was good. I will back to visit this wonderful hotel with my friends and family.

<Content>Stay at this hotel if you like rude people and small rooms A recent stay at the W confirmed my fears of previous reviews. Upon arrival after a long flight I was to find that the room I had pre paid for was not available and with total attitude was told had no idea when it would be. After waiting for more than 3 hours for a room I was given a smaller room than the one paid for (can you believe a so called 5 star hotel that has the shower over the bath). Stay at the brand new St Regis just 1 block from this hotel! Never again the staff have total attitude, rooms very small you can do much better than this hotel for the price!

<Content>Nice property, Helpless front desk We had two rooms for our family last week October 19-23, when I checked in at the desk I requested an upgrade (Platinum member), none available, next asked not to be near the elevator, told no problem. Once at the room that evening, settling in, I hear loud rushing sounds, I realized we were assigned a room next to the elevator shaft. (On backside of shaft, from door not apparent) I thought maybe at the bed, which is further away from the elevator; maybe it wouldn鈥檛 be so loud, wrong. I went down to the front desk to be reassigned a room, the young woman assured me the property was sold out and could not accommodate my request, she said it was such and such a room and was designed to be quiet. I mentioned she was welcome to come up and listen for herself. I finally requested to speak to a manager; well he was at the next terminal.He tells me, he does have other rooms, but they were all the same circumstance. Getting nowhere, I was assured it would be handled the next day  moved. The next day, before we leave for the day, we packed all our 7 bags, had them setting conveniently by the door for the bellman. At 1:00 or so I call the hotel to confirm what arrangements had been made. The front desk had no record of what happened and had no idea what I was talking about. So I go through the whole thing again, they assure me they will make the change, move us to another room and our keys will be at the front desk when we return.When we returned that evening, I go to the front desk to get our new key, then I鈥檓 handed the key for our same existing room. No record or any movement, at all.So in summary, the staff is friendly, there lips move, but nothing happens.(no welcome amenities)

<Content>Not for the over 50 something crowd We drove into San Francisco following the directions we recieved from the hotel we almost missed it.. the W sign and the parking garage were very difficult to see. The valet parking was pricey at $45.00 a night but the attendants were very prompt and friendly. In the hotel we found the lighting to be very...soft making us 50 something ladies look pretty darn good..... right up until we had to read something... The room was very small it had 2 (very comfortable) double beds, a window seat (which was ok) and a bathroom with a glass door? The lighting in the room  bathroom was again very soft and nice and not so nice for the above mentioned reasons. The bar/lobby/livingroom or whatever you call it was fine but not for us. We had dessert and a drink at the xyz which were good but pricey. We tried to make an appointment for a massage but they were all booked. The pool and exercise area were small. Don't bring your book to read and relax by the inside pool because there are no comfortable chairs. The staff throughout the hotel were friendly and helpful. The area at night made us midwesterners a little nervous to go out. Last but not least the thin walls were very noticeable at about 3:30 a.m........ probably not going to be a return guest at a W anywhere, sorry.

<Content>Nice but not at that price! I arrived at the hotel around 2pm but was told a room was not ready due to heavy load the night before; I was given a bottle of water and asked to return in about an hour. Returning 90 minutes later the room was ready. Check-in was quick and reasonably efficient. The room was nice in a very modernist fashion with a good view, with the Bay Bridge off in the distance. The room was very small however, especially at over $300/night. I didn't mind the dark decor, especially in the halls which were almost gloomy, but some might find it a bit much. Very nice gym facilities with pleasant staff. This was my first W visit and while nice I more inclined to stick with other Starwood properties in the future.

<Content>Chic but overpriced I have stayed at many hotels in San Francisco, and the room we got at the W seemed the most cramped. The Chic, trendy theme and the window seat made it bearable. The decor and fixtures were great. We used our Starwood points to stay at the hotel to try it out. For the weekend we stayed, it was a busy weekend in SF, so the rate for our standard room would have been $389/night if we had paid for it. Unfortunately, it was not worth it. We enjoyed the service, views, location, and the XYZ restaurant, but we feel there are better hotels in the city for even better price. We asked for a corner room, but they claimed there were none available. Perhaps that corner room would have changed our view of the room since it would have been more spacious. In all fairness, most of the large hotels in SF have small rooms, of which the corner rooms change the entire mood of the stay. We liked the pool and hot tub. Small, but a treat since many hotels in SF don't have a pool at all. I liked the glass ceiling. The Bliss Spa (operated independently of the W, but inside the hotel on its 4th floor) seemed unnecessarily snooty. Overall nice stay, but due to small standard room size for the price, we won't be staying at this W again.

<Content>Trendy stay in San Fran We stayed at the W in San Francisco in late September 2005. We were upgraded to a corner room on the 24th floor - with an amazing view of Bay Bridge - awesome at both sunrise and sunset!.As a fan of the W chain the room didn't disappoint, we soon had our music playing on the CD player and we slept like Babes on the soft beds, with duvets!In the evening the Lobby area is fully of buzzy people who are lounging on the sofas ... we struggled to find a quiet place to get a coffee while we recovered from a long journey.The concierge were extremely helpful, whatever questions we through at them - from where to fill our rental car with fuel to booking a restaurant that we passed on the cable car.If you are parking there, suggest that you drive around the block to the MOMA parking (right onto 3rd, then first right again) - which is less than half the price of Valet parking and they use the same parking lot!We had breakfast in the hotel on one morning, too over-fussy for us (although my husband rated the poached eggs), so ask for directions to Mels drive through diner about a block away.The free Wifi access in the lobby is a great resource.Would recommend the W, although I am not sure if the trendiness and centralish position is worth the additional cost!

<Content>Woed by the W I am getting to be quite a fan of the W brand.Friendly staff at check-in and a room upgrade to a huge corner room was a good start. The fresh modern decor in the W hotels suits my sense of style. Bliss products in the bathroom enhance the overall package.I didn't use the restaurants or bar since habitually I try and use local eateries.All in all a good hotel within easy reach of central San Francisco

<Content>Loved it! I stayed at the W Hotel in San Francisco for 4 nights and loved it. It was so nice. It definitely has a different feel to it. It's modern and comtemporary. It just feels very warm and inviting there. The staff was wonderful and very accomadating. The room was great. It was very clean and the bed was extremely comfy. My only complaint was the dinner menu at the XYZ restaurant didn't really have anything I liked on it and the waiter was a little rude when we only ordered dessert to go. Also, there aren't any vending machines in the hotel. The mini bar prices are high so go to the store and stock up on snacks and drinks for your room.

<Content>W = very Wow Stayed 5 nights late August, we were given a corner suite on the 19th floor what a lovely view of the bay bridge and harbour and I used starwood points for the room so it was free. The room was large and very comfortable, the usually heavenly beds and the bliss bathroom products were great.The room was very quiet the only noise as other people have commented is when you get out of the lift the bar area is always busy and very noisy during the evening. We had dinner in the restaurant twice and enjoyed our meals both times. For breakfast go the the bar you can get fresh fruit salad, muffins and fresh juice for about $5 each, what a bargin, we did this every morning.Only about a 5 minute walk to the shopping area and right next door to the art museum, what a great location.

<Content>One of the best sleeps ever! I stayed at the hotel from August 25th to the 29th. Other than navigating the way from the BART ($4.95 per person, as opposed to $16 per person for the shuttle, and approx $40 for the taxi) to the hotel, the W is easy to find. The closest BART station is Montgomery, which is about two blocks from the W. The hotel itself is very chic. The lobby during the day doubles as a DJ lounge at night; we didn't mind the music whatsoever. The front desk staff were very friendly, and were able to meet my request of an early check-in. The room was small but quiet, comfortable and meticulously clean. We practically melted into the beds, making that alone worth the stay! Shops are not too far away, though a walk to Union Square will be about six blocks. The views from the room were spectacular, and it was relaxing to spend evenings sitting on the alcove reading a book and looking at the San Francisco skyline. I would definitely make another stay at the W San Francisco when I visit again.

<Content>Loved this hotel! From the minute I walked into this hotel, I felt relaxed. When I checked in I was the only one on line but I am not surprised to hear that some people had to wait in line for a bit. The staff at the front desk is a bit slow and can be a little less attentive than one might like while on vacation but the atmosphere immediately puts you at ease. I had a regular corner room (i believe corner rooms are slightly larger than other rooms) and it was quite big, with a big desk and chair, entertainment unit, big bathroom, very large comfy bed and a even a little area by the window to lay down and gaze out onto San Francisco. All the floors are lit very dimly with music playing. The hotel restaurant was delicious for lunch and service was excellent. The Bliss Spa on the 4th floor was recently added and is such a great addition. The pool and gym area are very clean nice as well. Perhaps the only problem is that it isn't on the best block in San Fran. Several times when arriving at the hotel at night a homeless person would be standing right outside the hotel or actually come and open my cab door and ask for money. The area around the hotel at night is not that crowded. I think they should have a staff person ourside as they do at most other W Hotels. But overall, a very relaxing experience. Although it is not cheap, I think it is worth the money.

<Content>Service Great, Room mediocre Check-In: My Dad and I arrived at the W at 4:30 p.m. and waited in about a 2-3 person line, with three staff members checking in guests. Elisa checked us in and gave us a 12th floor Wonderful room with a Bay View. Lobby: The lobby was called the Living Room. The Living room was filled with cool and sophisticated furnishings and contemporary art. At night, the Living Room was filled with a mass of people at the bar and all over the Living Room. You felt special walking through the crowd to go to the elevators. Elevators and Hallyway: The elevator was dimly lit but in a cool, fun way. The elevators were very quick and very large. When you get off the elevators, the carpet reads Welcome!. The Hallway was lit by blue lights and spotlights on the art. The hallways smelled like new carpet.Room: We booked a 2 dbl. bed, non smoking, Wonderful room. When you first walk into the room, there is a little area with a bench and 3/4 full length mirror/ The bathroom was to the left. You continue walking in and there is the 2 dbl. beds crammed into the room. A built in Tv cabinet that felt like it would fall on you! A Desk with leather chair, a nightstand with some San Francisco Magazines and a W Hotels Book. The Desk featured Bliss, The Spa catalouges, the hotel directory, and some paper and pencils. At the end of the room by the windows was a large window seat with 4 brown square pillows and 2 neckrole pillows. There was a dark blue throw on the window seat. The coushin was stained with white and red staines. I suggest that be recovered. The Beds we're so comfortable, I slept like a rock. They had 4 down pillows, a down comforter with a brown duvet cover. The duvet covers we're both stained and were pretty gross. The headboards we're really cool: They were big slabs of wood that stoped just before the ceiling. For the long morning sleepers, there were wooden shades that kept about 3/4 of the sunlight out. 3 complaints: 1. The windows DID NOT OPEN. 2. The windows we're terribly dirty and hard to see out of 3. You needed to keep the shades on the windows, if you try to move the middle ones to the center of the seat, the window seat is unuseable. And if you want to move the outer wooden shades, there we're 2 wall sconces on each side so you could'nt put them on the wall. I agree with the previous reviewers that some of the furniture was a little shabby and scrathced and probably needed to be replaced in the near future. The Artwork was black and white pictures of San Francisco. There was a 27 inch tv, a dvd player, a CD player, the W CD, and the mini bar, which was terribly overpriced. The carpet was brown and was alittle worn. Bathroom: The bathroom was pretty awesome! The sink faucets came out of the wall and the sink was metal. The shower head was great! Is almost massaged you. The shower curtain was clean and had the W on it. 1 complaint: The door was a glass slider and it didnt work well. The glass was not opaqe but ribbed and you could see in easily. It also didn't slid very easily. The robes were great and were 100% cotton. Sweat/Wet: That is W's pool and fitness center.Sweat: The fitness center looked pretty well equiped with alot of machines and quality machines. Wet: The pool was dissapointing. It didn't have WET on the bottom which wasn't a big deal but it was tiny. There was a family with about 2 kids and it seemed they took up the whole pool! The tile around the pool was also outdated.Whatever/Whenever: That was their service to their guests which was pretty efficent. I called down and asked for extra towels b/c our got wet and they we're there in about only 5 minutes! Great!To rap it all up:We had a pretty good time in SF and at the W, but it was not perfect. The rooms need to be changed a little bit and the pool updated. Some people say the dark in the hallways hide the dirt and wear but i do noy feel that way. So a 3 star hotel experience. If I came back to SF, I would maybe stay here again, but probably the Four Seasons just down the street.One reccomendation:Go the the METREON!! For movies and games!

<Content>W is No Wow but is still Kool Check-in: Excellent. Room: Large, great bed and bathroom. Some of the furniture was scratched and needed to be refinished or replaced. Excellent TV and stereo. Wonderful restaurant for breakfast. Above average gym and VERY nice pool. One complaint: valet parking was $45.00 per nite: that is ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!! It was the one bad note on an otherwise great stay.

<Content>W was a great part of our trip! First thanks to all those who have posted reviews before me, as they helped me make my own travel plans. My husband and I stayed at the W Hotel in San Francisco over the July 4th weekend and we had a great time. (W stands for Welcome!) The thing I liked most about the hotel was that it was very, very clean. (W stands for Well-Kept!) The bed was comfortable and the room was spacious. My husband needed razors (since you can no longer carry them on airplanes) and W provided them free of charge in less than 10 minutes. (W stands for whatever, whenever). I loved the free assortment of BLISS products in the bathroom and that fact that they are replenished every day. We had a corner room on the 16th floor that overlooked the Oakland Bridge and the SFMOMA. Great location...and staff was helpful with directions. (W stands for Whereabouts!) A couple of notes: You can order from the cafe menu at the restaurant, so don't feel like you have to get a gourmet meal when you only want a burger. Also continental breakfast is a bit pricey for what you get...($2.50 for coffee, $2.50 for croissant, $2.50 for fruit) Better to get out into the city and find something quaint and fun. Hotel (not the rooms) is dark and moody, but part of it's modern charm... lots of art...funky and sophisticated...probably not the best place for kids, but definitely for singles and DINKs. (W stands for WOW!)

<Content>Wow for the W Just returned from a stay at the W. After reading some of the posts here I was a little hesitant. Our stay at the W was fabulous. From the moment we drove in we were pampered all through our stay. From the bellman to the bartender, everyone was courteous and helpful. The halls are dark with a club like feeling. If you are young and looking for a chic place to stay the W is the place.

<Content>Much prefer Hotel Vitale I stayed at W San Francisco for 5 nights and thought it was okay although costly. It wasn't until I stayed at Hotel Vitale 8 months later that I realized W was really mediocre in comparison.The decoration at W was rather dark and gloomy although modern with spacious bathroom. The staff were definitely rude and snooty. Hotel Vitale was chic, bright, comfortable, relaxing, and it has the most friendly and helpful hotel staff I can ever recall! Having lived in SF in the distant past, I found the Embarcadero district of Hotel Vitale much more enjoyable (Ferry Building, restaurants, Bay Bridge, NICE walk/jog along the water to Fisherman's Wharf) than areas around W in South of Market. Both were around $220/night. In the future, I will never stay at W in SF, possibly not at any W. I LOVED Hotel Vitale and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Tounge in Chic My husband and I appreciated the little touches that made the W special. When they were helping us unload our luggage, they were able to discreetly announce our arrival to the front desk so that they were waiting for us at check in. They have a sense of humor which is appropriatte for the property since it has funny little touches like an Etch a Sketch on desk. The bellman was a doll and gave me a great introduction to my room and the hotel. We stayed on the 25th floor with a corner room overlooking the Bay Bridge. It had cute window seats and I love their linens and color palette. Some would say my bedroom at home resembles the hotel room. Bath robes are nice and light and they have very generous amenities from Bliss Spa. We didn't get to check out the spa or pool but will do that on our next visit.

<Content>W in SF This W property is in the South of Market area; not renowned for tourism but across from the Moscone Convention Center and near the dot-com business area and SBC Park (baseball). It has a trendy euro-asian aesthetic, from the apparral of the staff to the decor and vibe. Inside, it is dark, stylish, with audible techno music and valets wearing wireless headsets (almost a cliche). It does feature an expansive lobby and bar area, populated by the dot-com crowd in an area still lacking many evening attractions. If you need to be close to shopping and tourist attractions, look again. If business or staying in a W is warranted, this is your place. Note that the BART light rail is a few blocks away.

<Content>Not so good as W Union Square We did have a few problems here. Park round the back at the ordinary parking lot near the art gallery and save yourself over $20 a day. It is one minute's walk away and no waiting for your car at the time of check out. Don't believe the staff who say there is no nearby parking!Avoid the bar if you can't stand the DJ's taste in music, he is the only one enjoying it and no-one else can hear to talk.The desk staff were sniggering and cheeky about guests in our hearing. The concierge couldn't care less and ignored me for nearly 5 minutes whilst I waited like a naughty kid by her desk. She was having an interesting personal phone call for me to listen to though.We were woken up by a screaming tannoy at 5am. The guy told us in broken English that it was a mistake, and sorry. Then he did it again. And again at 5.30am. Later the manager told me there was a fire alarm activated. It seems no-one knew what to do but as we couldn't understand the guy on the tannoy it is as well there was only a mistake to deal with. To be fair the manager handled my complaint well.We are used to W Union Square. Won't be going back to W San Francisco.

<Content>Chic  My wife and I chose W for our first stay in San Francisco based primarily on it's proximity to Yerba Buena Park, which we figured would offer good dog walking possibilities. The property is quite spiff, and our standard room was very comfortable with all the deluxe amenities -the window seat was a nice touch.The staff was very friendly and helpful (with the single exception of a concierge who couldn't help us find a suburban phone #).Breakfasts in XYZ -get it?- were great, and the folks there couldn't have been nicer.While we were aware of the W's chic and sexy reputation, this did not fully prepare us for the lobby scene each evening, when we 50-somethings would return from exploring the city only to run a gauntlet of scenesters partying to DJ-driven technopop! It was, like, so totally not us!This party theme was continued each night by our neighbor (starting at 1:35 and 2:25 am, but who's counting?), who must have enjoyed sleeping to the soothing strains of his CD player - the bass was particularly well amplified through our headboard! When I finally called the desk at 5 am, however, the security staff were very prompt and effective.We'll look for someplace less self-consciously chic on our next visit.

<Content>W Hotel in SF, more she she than Tza Tza My wife and recently returned from the W Hote in SF and let me tell you, the place is slicker than greese. The rooms feel tremendously clean, although I would still stay away from the comforters as is recommended in all hotel rooms. There is plenty of space in each room, the plush wood is a nice dark brown which gives it a homey feel. There did not go the route of cheesey floral patterns that many of the other leading brands use. It is located right next to the Museum of Modern Art as well as the Moscone Convention Center. Check out the Thirsty Bear Accross the street while you are there. Great tappas!

<Content>Could've been better Stayed in this hotel late September, 2003. My best friend and I were very excited to stay at our first W, expecting luxurious surroundings. While everything was very nice, you definitely want to get your own room. The rooms are good sized with a King bed, but two Queens was ridiculously small. Linens and pillows were good, bathroom was AWESOME, hotel in general was what we expected. However, please be aware of the incredibly steep parking charge --- $40 per car, per day. Also, the hotel borders neighborhoods that could use some renovations. You don't want to walk alone at night (as we were warned by locals.) The bar is really crowded on Friday nights --- very fun. All in all, I'd stay somewhere better next time, but this was okay.

<Content>very nice, typical W (not necessarily for the traditional set) Stayed 1 nite here this week. Was a very nice hotel - trendy and hip, not traditional. Good for business travellers but may not be for ppl w/young kids or older travellers. The hotel was very nice - neat rooms, very clean, comfy bed, bathrobes, coffeemaker, Bliss bath products (although housekeeping didn't leave soap for the bathroom sink), friendly staff, good bar, and good food at the XYZ restaurant. Hallways and elevators were a bit dark and it was a bit overwhelming w/the loud music in the reception area, but that's somewhat typical of Ws. Food and drinks were a bit pricey, but I guess that is what to be expected in the cities. Can get grab and go pastries, fruit, yogurt, coffee at the bar in the a.m., although pricey ($10 for a granola and fruit mix!). Parking was very expensive - $45/night. Also, heads up if you stay near the fire house side (near the parking entrance) of the hotel - you might get woken up in the middle of the night for a fire call. Also, heads up on the opaque glass doors on the bathrooms - if you're travelling w/friends, this might be a bit much. (You can't really see much, but it might be uncomfortable for some.)One other thing - the gym/fitness center is currently undergoing renovations, so they have an arrangement with a hotel down the road for W guests. Otherwise, very nice place. Will definately stay here again.

<Content>disappointing We had stayed in W Hotels before and had a certain expectation in mind. This property is way off the mark. The service was poor. It's as if this property is a training ground for high school hotel workers. The housekeeping service was indifferent. The concierge service was unprofessional.The room service, however, was prompt and good. As far as the room layout, it's hard to get used to a glass bathroom door. There is no privacy in the bathroom.

<Content>Would not stay here again. My husband and I live 30 miles from the city and will go in and take weekend getaways often. We have stayed in NUMEROUS hotels in SF. I have always liked W's in the past, so we thought we'd give this one a whirl. Oh man, i felt dirty the whole time. It wasnt bad housekeeping per say, i just felt like I didnt want to touch anything. It felt dark, cold and univiting. The lobby is annoying. WAY too loud, and I felt like I was invading people's space by trying to get to my room. The food at the hotel restaurant was so so, nothing special of very pricey. I would definetly never stay here again. There are MANY places that are so much nicer and more friendly!

<Content>Wwway Underwhelming I have never written a review but used this site often. Having said that, my recent stay at the W made me want to share my experience. I did a lot of research for my weekend stay in SF. I looked at a variety of places $150 and up. I picked the W because of the reviews on the website and was very disappointed.The hotel room was really small - even though it was termed spectacular. There were two double beds that were squished in there, and a entertainment bureau that felt like it might fall right on top of you...It felt really small which was more than just an aesthetic problem since there were two of us bumping into each other all the time.For $239 the only thing special about the room was some complimentary Bliss products. Everything else was for sale with a high price tag -the $6 water, the $14.95 a day internet rental, the use of the business office and so one and so forth.The room service was also over-priced and the restaurant (which I had heard good things about) was really terrible. I had soup which I sent back and a $10 dollar salad. Again not happy.I must also say that I am not one to post my grienvances but I would really steer people away from staying at this over-priced, underwhelming hotel - basically it is just too much for too little.Plus, it feels like NYC instead of SF, CA. Will be going more local next time.

<Content>Great hip hotel -- very comfortable The reviews on this site are pretty right on, except for the part about the techno music. You can barely hear it in the hallway next to the elevator. I stayed in a corner king room on an upper floor with a great view of the bay bridge and surrounding bay to the south. It's the most peaceful urban hotel room that I've ever stayed in. The really fun part of the hotel is that when you're ready to leave the calmness of your room, it's a short elevator ride down to the 2nd floor bar or the 1st floor cafe/bar, both of which get a large crowd of urban young professionals seven nights/week. The bar staff were not pretentious at all; they were very friendly and approachable. The drinks are expensive, but the atmosphere is great, so long as you're into the hip/trendy setting. The room is set up really nicely, and the bed, as at all W hotels, is probably the most comfortable hotel bed that I've slept in. The sitting area beside each of the windows was also great. It was large enough to curl up on and read a book. The bathroom is large and the shower is pretty decent (nothing like the shower at the carneros inn, but the water pressure is strong and adjustable...it's also not cramped). I understand some of the reviewer complaints about the bathroom door. You can't see through it exactly, but it's not opaque. In a King room it makes sense. In a double room, I'm not sure why they wouldn't switch to an opaque door (if you're not sharing a bed with your fellow traveller, I really doubt you want to see a sillouette of him/her on the can) but then again, it let a lot of natural light into the bathroom. Some reviewer mentioned that the wooden shades didn't block the light. I guess their shades must have been broken, because I found that they worked great, and I like my hotel rooms very dark. I also ordered room service one morning and it was brought up in about 10-15 minutes and was very good. Yeah, it's expensive...it's hotel room service, so what. The pool and workout area are also very nicely done. I wish that the outside patio that extends from the pool were on a higher floor rather than just the 3rd, but then again it was raining most of the time, so it wouldn't have mattered for my stay anyway.The only piece of advice I have is this. If you're getting to the hotel by cab instead of your own vehicle, don't drag all your luggage in through the main enterance at the corner of 3rd and Howard. Instead, go down Howard about 100 feet to where it says Wheels and go in that way. If you go in the main enterance and it's after 5pm, you will feel like an idiot b/c you'll be dragging your luggage through a mob of people and probably try to check in at the bar. The hotel is a great retreat and you'll have fun as long as you like the hip/trendy type of hotel. Check out their website and know what you're getting into...if you're older and don't want to be around a bunch of young professionals, probably better off at a Union Square hotel, which is really only a few blocks away.

<Content>very slick and modern, if you like that kind of place The W is lovely, but you have to want to be cool to stay there. It has a hip, edgy style, so don't plan on coming through in your jeans and sneakers while site seeing.   There's a great bar in the hotel on the second floor - although it gets very crowded weekend night.

<Content>Long-term stay I lived for 7 weeks at the W while on business in CA. I initially had a wonderful 19th floor room facing the Metreon and the Yerba Buena Arts Center with a full-length window seat. The room also had a very large, simple bathroom. The Zen-like d??cor was relaxing and fun--it was the most peaceful hotel room I have had the pleasure of experiencing. Service was high quality throughout the hotel, though the meal service in the hotel's restaurant can be very slow depending upon the server. The concierge was excellent, arranging Alcatraz tickets, suggesting restaurants, providing maps and information about Napa Valley and answering questions about the area. When my wife came out for company business we shared a 12th floor King Corner room facing the Bay Bridge. The bathroom was smaller than my 19th floor room but the room had the same wonderful features: a wooden headboard that stopped just short of the ceiling, 20 inch TV, minibar, great views of the surrounding area, and the same peaceful vibe and d??cor. We used the hotel laundry service--clothes were returned the same day when we submitted them in the morning. After I left for home, my wife had many small service issues with housekeeping (on separate days they did not provide her soap, then toilet paper, then took her towels and bath mat and did not replace them). The hotel is dark in the corridors and other guests would loom up out the semi-darkness and surprise me. The techno music in the lobby and elevator areas was a bit much at 5 AM when I went to work but this is the price for staying in a hip hotel! The only problem I had was loud music from the adjoining guest room one day at 3 AM. A call to security and 3 minutes later, my room was again silent enough to hear the AC kick on. I would gladly stay there again, and I miss my peaceful, hip W!

<Content>Very cool place I stayed at the W San Francisco in September for two nights. While the location is a bit off the beat for shopping, the hotel itself is fabulous. My room was set in a corner with a nice view of the city. The bed is so comfortable and the linens and decor were very stylish. The bathrooms were large and very accomodating. At night the hotel turned very dark and gave off a very youthful vibe. The bar was very crowded with a young clientele. The hotel staff was very pleasant upon check in and the guests were an eclectic mix of business travelers and tourists. the fee for parking was outrageous - $40 day. I will return for another stay in Feb.

<Content>depends on your taste, but the best bed in the world I have to admit that this review is based on a stay in 2002, but I've been by since then and the place seems pretty much the same. I titled my review as i did because the W has a very definite ambiance, and if their idea of cool isn't yours, the public spaces may not be for you. Let's just say that the lighting in the elevators and hallways is just super if you're looking for a high-tech opium den. The bar and restaurant were nice but somewhat sterile--cosy is not the vernacular here. I will give them props for nice, comfy lobby chairs and sofas arranged for chatting with your friends.The concierge was very nice and friendly and funny and, of course, helpful. The Desk staff was professional if somewhat distant. Valet parking was efficient and expensive.As for the room, it was smallish, as was the bathroom, but quite comfortable and well-appointed. It also had a beautiful view of the Bay Bridge. There were two outstanding things about the room, though:1. The most comfortable bed in the known universe (which, incidentally, you can buy from their website). I travel a lot and have been tortured by mattresses and pillows across the country, but this is simply superb sleeping.2. It had a window seat. This may be just my own personal preference, but there is just somethig so appealing about sitting in a window seat on a cold, misty night, propped on nice soft pillows, looking out at the Bay Bridge, listening to good music and reading a good book. (One doesn't have to club it every night....)Also, the room was nice and quiet, but none of the windows opened.I gave the W only 4 stars because I prefer cosy and old-fashioned elegance to the very steel-glass-and-leather style here, and I feel that overall it is too expensive (room service, phone, etc. prices were hilarious). There is a good parking garage a couple of blocks away if you don't want to pay for their valet service. W is across Market St from the Union Square area and directly next to MOMA, so it's a short walk to shopping and a breath away from Moscone Center.

<Content>Don't expect too much and you'll be happy... So I stayed at the W for New Year's Eve weekend and checked in on Thursday night, departed on Sunday. The check-in was a bit dissapointing as it took the staff about 7 minutes to come out from behind closed doors and then another 15 to finally get checked in through the system. The room is small but very hip, comfortable and with an amazing view of the bay area. The beds make the hotel and will not dissapoint. Had dinner at the XYZ and it is highly overrated, but excellent for breakfast. Their whatever, whenever service failed to impress me. I called at 6:00pm on New Year's Eve in desperate need of finding a store open to purchase a belt, was told I would receive a call back and NEVER DID. Call me crazy but I thought whatever, whenever meant they could actually GET ME THE BELT should I have needed it? And all I wanted was a store that was open so I could walk to it...it's really more like whatever, whenever we want. Besides that, the rooms are quiet, never heard these fire engines so frequently mentioned, unless outdoors. The bellmen are very helpful and at the concierge desk downstairs, the man was so kind to print out boarding passes for my friend and I on day of departure. Bring extra cash for martinins at the bar, they range anywhere from $8-$12. Overall, for the vibe, this hotel is awesome, total party atmosphere...but for service, a little too much attitude. It's hard to be nice to people who work for a hotel making close to minimum wage who act like you owe them something.

<Content>Great hotel, tips for parking Overall, the W hotel was a wonderful experience. The bedrooms were clean and decorated beautifully, the beds feel like you are sleeping on air, and the bathrooms were luxurious and stocked with great bath products. One bartender was outright rude, but everyone else (especially housekeeping and the concierge) was extremely nice and helpful. We got excellent recommendations on restaurants.Parking is outrageous ($46.50 per day) but we parked our car ourselves in the same garage the valets use (on Minna, one minute walk from the hotel) and paid $20 per day. It was definitely worth the expense to have our car to explore the city.I am in my late 20's but was there for a quiet vacation with my boyfriend. We enjoyed being away from the bustle of Union Square, and the walk helped with the great restaurants we tried out. The hotel is geared towards a younger crowd but we saw many older patrons who seemed to be enjoying themselves.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone venturing to San Francisco.

<Content>Among the best in SF! I've stayed in many of the top hotels in SF (Ritz Carlton, Park Hyatt, Mark Hopkins, etc.) and the standard rooms in the W are easily the best. While many guidebooks and reviewers tend to focus on suites, I've noticed that the standard rooms of upper echelon hotels are not that much different than your higher-end Hilton or Marriott. Not so with the W. The design is sleek and appealing, and there are numerous little touches in the rooms which you won't elsewhere. And the location is pretty good too, despite what previous reviewers have mentioned. If you can't afford a suite but still want a 5-star style room, the W is the way to go.

<Content>A modern hotel with exceptional bedrooms and an interesting restaurant The XYZ restaurant offered excellent food in a modern athmostphere. The service was excellent and all the staff very professional and efficient. The bedrooms were very large with every possible thing you could require, comfortable beds, computer, tv. video, mini bar etc. There was also an enormous bathroom with a powerful shower and an abundance of shower gels, shampoos, etc.I would certainly have no hesitation if recommending this hotel.San Francisco is a fascinating city which is easy to get around. The taxis are cheap and the tram quite an experience. Don't miss the museumns and the Pier at Fisherman's Wharf where the sea-lions are! There are good shops and Lake Tahoe and the Winelands are within easy reach.

<Content>W might stand for 'wonderful' Took advantage of the Chrysler promo:arriving in our Crossfire. From the valets, front desk to restaurant staff, we were treated with casual elegance. Had an exceptional lunch with perfect service in the XYZ, well worth the price. The W's decor is wonderful with unique touches and artful lighting. It's so nice to come off the elevator to subdued light tones with more light just where you need it near the door. Classy...and this won't remind you of lots of overlit hotels. The room is stylin, sexy and done with class. This one is not like just another hotel room, but you have to like the contempory look. In spite of being across from Moscone Center and a Fire Station nearby, neither my wife or I ever heard the sirens once we fell asleep. The double pane windows kept the street noise out, and the bed gets credit for a great night's sleep away from home. We will visit this hotel again, and recommend you treat yourself to some laid back classy style!

<Content>I love the Service and style of the W This is a fantastic hotel! I would like to tell you about my experience with the consierge. I called a few days before I showed up and spoke with a very enthusiastic consierge, who gave me a fabulous rec. for a hairdresser. Although he offered to make the appt. for me, I did it myself, and I was treated to a fantastic haircut at a gorgeous, nearby salon (totally within walking distance) from a sweet and unpretentious hairdresser. I LOVED staying at the W and highly rec. it to anyone who wants confort, a bit of pampering, and nice design and style.

<Content>FANTASTIC HOTEL I stayed at the W in SF for four nights in Nov 04, and I found the entire experience fabulous! My room had an awesome view of the Bay Bridge, everything in the room was super-comfy (esp. the bed and the bathtub), the hotel is quiet in the halls, I loved the Bliss bath products, the room service was DELICIOUS every time and always arrived within 15 minutes of ordering, and all of the service was wonderful, from the front desk to the room service to the maids. I have spent a lot of time South of Market, so I know the neighborhood well, and this is a great locale! I did not want my W experience to end, and I can't wait until I check into the W Seattle in January! I highly rec. this hotel--it's a wonderful sanctuary from the hectic SoMa world outside.

<Content>Not the best location During a recent trip to San francisco, we ended up staying longer than anticipated. The hotel that we originally stayed in was fully booked for the two extra days that we needed. So, becfore checking out, I called the W, as I am a member of their special guests program.Generally, I find my stays at various W Hotels to be pleasant. I enjoy the contemporary decor and style of service of the chain.However, the W in San Francisco is not one that I'd return to. The location leaves much to be desired. Although it is accross the street from the SF Museum of Modern Art, and is within walking distance to Union Square, the area has uncomfortable vibe at night. If walking, one has to go down either of two dimly lit streets to get back to the hotel. Fortunately, there were cabs there, but it doesn't seem as though one should have to take a cab to get a few blocks away because of the atmosphere by the hotel at night, when it is advertised as being a Union Square hotel.The room, an upgrade to a corner room, was quite small for it to be considered an 'upgrade.' The bathroom was fine, however. Also, the view was quite good. Perhaps if one is there on business and has people around them when walking about at night, it would be better. But, as a single woman, I would not stay there again. Not close enough to Union Square to be convienent, especially at night.

<Content>Poor service, poor attitudes I planned a romantic weekend getaway for my boyfriend  myself and another couple. Looking forward to splurging, I knew that the W Hotels had a reputation for being top-notch, even tough a little pricey. Unfortunately, this romantic getway was not all we expected.Bad:Service overall was terrible. Starting at the front desk, they were all too cool to be speaking to mere mortals, such as myself.I had booked 2 king bed, non-smoking rooms with a view of bridge. When I checked in, none of these options were available. After some debate, they were able to find me non-smoking rooms with a shabby view, each with 2 double beds. So much for romance.Parking was soooooo expensive! We decided to park ourselves around the corner in a public garage and later saw the W staff parking their valeted cars there, as well, for double the cost.Rooms were small for the price, and anything you touched cost an ungodly amount of money. Consierge supposedly booked reservations, which were not ready at the correct time.Doorman service for taxis was useless! Easier to fetch your own cab.Good:I loved the Aveda bathroom amenities.The beds were great!Overall:Try the Adagio. We loved that place!

<Content>Never again. W HotelSan FranciscoOct 28 鈥?Nov. 1, 2004, Room 516Oct. 29 No housekeeping at all. Called at 10 pm and asked if we wanted any.Oct. 30 Called concierge and asked for a cab van for six people at a specific time. Called at 7:00 for 8:30 pm. It was a woman. Got to concierge at appointment time and a man told us to go see the bell boy in the street, Luckily we only had five and squeezed into a cab, and made our dinner reservation with only 5 min, to spare.Parking charges, internet charges, room service charges are unconscionably large.Telephone is nearly inaudible to other inside hotel numbers both from the room and from the house phone across from the desk in the lobby. Strong hum indicates wiring problems with the phone system.Reservation was screwed up and we were given an invoice, and it was charged to Visa, after the first night of a four night reservation. Called early in the morning after the invoice was put under the door, and changed the incorrect reservation. Desk called back a second time hours later confused over the reservation.Sound isolation from very, very loud bass in the lobby practically shook the room. Called at 9:40 pm and complained but was told nicely that it would be over at 10 pm, which seemed reasonable.Room was ready early.

<Content>For the hip  Negatives: The most unwelcoming, unfriendly front desk staff of any resort I've ever stayed at. They act like they are too good for their guests. The hotel is very dark and you can't even get to the lobby on a Thurday, Friday or Saturday night ...it's full of locals for happy hour. Forget about sleeping on those nights also, there's a D.J. that plays in the lobby and people are up until all hours of the night partying. I'm only 33, but come on...you get the feeling that you are staying in a night club. Positives: Room was very clean, houskeeping does a great job - nice size room for being in the city. If you are a trendy, hip person then this is the place for you, my husband are I are just too preppyfor the W.

<Content>Hip  I spent two nights at the W. The last time I stayed there was just after opening several years ago. The hotel is showing some wear and tear. The carpet in the hallways is rather worn. The carpet in my room was very worn.I really like all of the amenities in the room though. In particular, I appreciated the DVD player so I could finish the movie I started on the plane. The room had everything I could have asked for. Cordless phone, alarm clock, coffee maker, wet/dry bar, CD player (with CD), TV, desk/chair, couch/bench.I'd recommend a corner room to get windows on two walls. The room I was in was above the average San Francisco sized room which tends to be too small.Expensive. A small bottle of water cost $6, and parking was $46 per night (outrageous!). The broadband internet service cost $15 per day ($5 more than most hotels).The hotel and clientelle are on the hip side of things. The Friday night I was there included a DJ in the lobby to top off the club-like atmosphere.The decor and setup in the room was great though, and probably enough for me to return.

<Content>Customer Service? What customer service? I kept notes for this one, as the first night (of 5) was the most awful hotel experience I have ever had:1. Staff just stood around watching as I struggled in with two bags into what appeared to be a discotheque. No-one pointed me in the direction of check-in.2. The check-in girl made it seem like she was doing me a favour by letting me stay, rather than treating me like a customer. Big attitude problem.3. My reservation for a king smoking room had been made nearly seven months previously. The check-in girl told me there were no smoking rooms available as only 2 of 31 floors were smoking. This is unacceptable in a state like California where smoking in public places is banned.4. She was obviously lying because when I kicked up a fuss she offered me a twin bed smoking room with an option to move to a king smoking the following day.5. I later found out that there was a king smoking room that would have been available after they finished cleaning it ... at 8pm!!6. The much advertised in room CD player did not work.7. The maid had not reset the alarm clock which awoke us at 7am - in all my travels I have never had to check that the alarm is off, it is something I take for granted.8. The blinds (which shut out very little light) were taped together with unsightly blue sticking tape. The same blinds are in the Sheraton on the Park in Sydney, but they have the foresight to install blackout blinds behind them.9. This is the first hotel in the Starwood chain that I have stayed in where you have to pay for bottled water (at $6 a pop)10. The prohibitive cost of amenities, dry bar and wet bar which had a 20% service charge on top, meant was I was not inclined to use hotel services wherever possible.11. No morning newspaper, despite it being part of the deal as a Starwood Preferred Guest.12. The heated pool was freezing cold13. The whirlpool didn't work.14. A used plaster, cigarette butt and what looked like dog poo was around the swimming pool floor.15. The bathroom tap came off in my hand.16. The batteries were low on the TV remote control.I gave up writing down problems after the first night. However we were moved the next day, the bed was very comfortable, and the service level rose to mediochre for the remainder of our stay. If it hadn't I would have asked for a transfer to the Westin. I shall not be staying at W again.

<Content>Trendier does not mean better I was not impressed with this hotel. I visit SF quite a lot and have been booking my hotels through a reliable and reputable reservation company for the past 7 years. I arrived at the hotel on a Friday evening and was curtly and rudely informed by the woman at the front desk, that my reservation did not exist and that there was a city-wide sell out, but that they did have a room available for me that was $20 more the original price I reserved it for! I took it as I was tired and had little energy to argue. I asked if they would have a room the next night and was told they could put me on the waiting list. No offer to help me find another room in the city. The hallways were dark, the windows in my room didn't totally block out the noise from the fire engines pulling out of the fire station right next door to the hotel, and the room itself was very small. I called my reservation company and they were able to get me a room with a city view at the Park Hyatt for $60 less than the W. What a difference! I hadn't stayed at the Park Hyatt before then, but I will definitely stay there again. The view from my room was incredible... TransAmerica building, Coit Tower, North Beach, the piers and a partial view of the Bay Bridge! My room was 2x as big as the W and most importantly, the staff was amazing, from the doorman to the concierge. Everyone was smiling, very attentive and helpful. I was especially impressed with the concierge who had helped me store my goods from a day of shopping at the Ferry Market. As she helped me, guest after guest approached her and thanked her for her spot-on recommendations. The Park Hyatt is not trendy like the W, but to a seasoned hotel guest like me, the Park Hyatt was a saving grace! I also recommend the following hotels: Hotel Milano (price and convenience-parking package available) and Galleria Park Hotel (great for service)

<Content>$46 per night for parking? Are they crazy? The W is a well kept hotel not far from union square. The mood is hip and funky and some decent weekend rates can be found on the internet. But I found the $46 per night parking charge to be totally unacceptable. I have never experienced such a high price for valet parking. Unfortunately, there were really no self-park options in the area. If I stay at this hotel again, I will definitely not bring a car!

<Content>Eh Hip hotels in NYC and L.A. have some of the sharpest front-of-the-house crews around. So it's surprising that the W's seems so amateur. You can call the front desk, the concierge, and the bellman without ever getting an answer, and wait over an hour for a bag to be delivered. Too bad, because it's a really pretty place.

<Content>Most comfortable hotel I ever stayed in The lobby is funky with weird music, and the hallways are poorly lit. I wondered what I was getting myself in for when I walked in. But the room was the most comfortable hotel room I have ever stayed in. You could get lost in the down quilt, or perch in the window seat and cuddle up under the cushions and afghans and watch the traffic on the bay bridge. There was enough light in the room to read or work by. I never wanted to leave. I travel a lot and have become hard to please, but the W has my vote.

<Content>Very cool and funky, but not cheap Spent 3 nights here. Good location - easy walk to everything. Fabulous restaurant. Efficient staff - as friendly as necessary, but just don't expect to be treated like royalty. Right next door to the conference centre and art museum.Prices are high - $46 a night valet parking, eating for 2 in the restaurant for less than $100 is tough.Very modern, stylish, tastefully lit (no, it's not bright) - if you want a typical SF boutique hotel don't come here. If you have to share a room with someone you aren't intimate with, don't come here. If you want to have a cheap break stay well away. But, if you want to treat someone special with an eye for style and you don't mind spending proper money then you could do very well here.Rooms are pretty compact, but it's a modern downtown hotel so that's normal. Everything was clean and hassle-free.The only reason I wouldn't go back is that if I wanted to spend that much money on my beloved once more then I'd pick another W in a different cool city because we've done SF now :o)

<Content>Not worth the money I stayed at the W San Fran for a week in February while attending a conference. I found the hotel staff to be somewhat disinterested in attending to my requests, and found the lobby/bar so busy at times it was difficult to walk through just to get to the elevators to go to my room. The halls were dimly lit and intimidating for people walking alone. I shared a room with a female colleague and we were horrified to discover that the bathroom doors were basically see-thru. There was only a ledge along the window to sit, no chairs in the room to relax in. We both brought laptop computers and were charged $14.95 per computer per day, for interenet access. We were told the charge for the room (for HSIA) was $14.95 per day, so it was a surprise to see the price doubled upon check-out, especially after being there for 6 days.Overall I felt that for the money spent at the hotel the rooms were small, the halls were very dark, the staff was not interested in customer service, and the bathrooms created too intimate a feel for collegues travelling together. I would not return.

<Content>Rooms small and dark I did not enjoy my stay. The hotel was very expensive for such small rooms and unlit corridors. The colors used in the rooms are browns and tans. Very drab! Small sitting area in the room and in the main entrance. The location is good if you are going to the convention center; however, it is not close to very much of anything else. It does not look like it does on the internet. I would suggest that you find another place to stay if you want to enjoy your visit.

<Content>Great stay at the W I loved the W. It helped that we got a corner suite which is extra spacious, with a great view of the bay. The location is a bit out of the way though, in the SOMA area. It's a 15 min walk or a cab ride to the fun areas like Union Square, Embarcadero center, etc. Here are some photos of the hotel and room: http://*******************************

<Content>"Weird" The only word that comes to mind is Weird. However, my stay at the W was both positive and negative. The rooms were fine (altough somewhat small) and the computer access was quite good. The hotel interior however was annoyingly dark everywhere, including the elevator stations, the floor hallways and the lobby. Falling or bumping into something was a real concern. The bathrooms had elaborate beauty and body products but not a shower cap in sight. The staff members were all dressed in black, wearing ear phones and walkie-talkies. The only word that comes to mind is Weird. The next time in San Francisco I will return to a warmer, more traditional luxury hotel.
