<Content>So loud. Marble floors have no place being near guest rooms I'll start off with the good things. It's right next to the main train station and tram lines so getting there and leaving is very easy. The hotel staff had no problem speaking English and checking in and out was a snap. The worst thing is that they have marble floors outside of the guest rooms so that when a woman in high heels leaves her room at 5 AM it will sound like a horse walking on pavement and there's no way you'll sleep through it. Any time someone comes or goes on your floor you'll hear it loud and clear. If you want to get unbroken sleep, this hotel is not the place for you. If you're above 6'1, the single beds will be too short for you. If you have a car they do have parking but it's expensive and you have to park in their back alley with about 1/2 and inch of clearance on either side so if you need to move your car very often I'd try and find other arrangements. I most certainly would not stay here again due to the amount of noise caused by their marble floors. Perhaps it was just the floor my room was on but I wouldn't risk booking here again to find out.

<Content>Hotel National Not What We Hoped This hotel is not accurately represented on their website. The room was dirty carpets, dusty, but bathroom was clean. They said they had AC but only a desktop fan. I tried my best to communicate with staff in German, but some English had to be spoken. They were very rude once they relized we were Americans. Positive--the inclusive Buffet was AWESOME in the morning. Also, location being across from subway station was convenient, but confusing for a new tourist.Bottom line: The resort talks itself up to be better than it is. My suggestion in to go next door to Hotel Color. The area was so-so, but not a good place if you have children/teenagers.

<Content>nice hotel, pleasant service and good location i stayed at hotel national for one night as i was just passing through frankfurt briefly. this hotel is quite nice. the location is excellent as it鈥檚 close to the train station. very convenient if you are just passing through. it seems like they get a lot of business travellers there. i got to the hotel very early around 9am and my room was not ready yet. though regular checkin time is 2pm, they were apologetic and told me to come back in a couple of hours. i did and it still was not ready so i came back a couple of hours later. i was very tired and jetlagged and just wanted to lay down. i finally was able to checkin at 1pm. they gave me a voucher for a free drink and breakfast. i was pretty sure when i booked through my travel agent the price did not include breakfast so i think they gave me a complimentary breakfast because i waited for so long for my room. normally breakfast is 8鈧?i think. though i would鈥檝e paid that for the breakfast. there was more offered then i expected. including a variety of hams, cheeses, smoked salmon and hot eggs and sausage. as well i had booked a single room but i discovered they upgraded me to a twin one which was much bigger. the room is very nice and clean with really high ceilings. the bathroom as well is very clean and modern with shower. the area itself isn鈥檛 the quietest as it鈥檚 close to the train station but it didn鈥檛 bother me that much. there is free internet in the lobby. and a nice bar and breakfast room. walking to the shopping and tourist areas is very close abour 15 minutes. for a pleasant and convenient stay i would recommend the hotel national.

<Content>best 2 star hotel in Germany not a 4 star hotel. Rooms and bath look very shop worn. Service was poor. Have stayed in Germany and in Frankfort many times. For Germany not even a good 3 star hotel. I would say 2 or 21/2 stars. Not worth the money. Will not stay there again.

<Content>Big rooms Location: Near the train Station about 5-10mins walkReceptionist: Friendly and able to provide informationRooms: The room was spacious and the toilet was spotlessly clean. The decor of the room was however on the 70sor 80s era. But its does look nostalgic. The pillows are not fluffy but is didn really bother me. Nice simple hotel.

<Content>2-3star Hotel with great service I booked via Hotwire b/c they stated this hotel was a 3 1/2 star hotel. I would rate this hotel as 2-3 star max. It does have a small bar area and a restaurant which is ok. Breakfast is 9 Euro. You are better served to walk into the Underground Subway station by the Irish pub and get a snack or go to Burger King and save the Euro. The staff were super efficient, friendly, and helpful. 4 Star staff. Internet computers for free in the lobby. Quiet room and maybe a bit expensive at $130 USD, but I would stay here again, I would just know it is a 2 1/2 star hotel. Restaurant and bar don't mean too much to me.Being next to the train station was AWESOME. Red light district and its element is overrated as bad in this area. I wouldn't let this fact deter you since it wasn't as IN your face as I worried about. You can easily bypass this area and not worry about it so stay here with confidence. There is a Le Meriden around the corner so you know the Hotel's KNOW this area is good for travellers.

<Content>Super Staff This is an excellent hotel We were on the 4th floor room 418 and obviously recently renovated. Large flatscreen tv two single beds put together but extremely comfortable and big.Roomy wardrobe space and safe, minibar and tea and coffee making facilities a great help after a day or night out.Bathroom was absolutely gorgeous loads of towels changed every day great power shower which could be height adjusted which is great.Very quiet at back of hotel only problem was the heat very warm in Frankfurt last week 34deg!! and no a/c but the very helpful Desk Clerk Marcus who was so pleasant and helpful supplied us with a large fan and extra pillows.The front desk staff were a joy to deal with we arrived very early about 10.30 am but our room was ready even though the hotel was very busy.Free internet service in lobby tea and cakes in lobby in evening we also got vouchers for a free drink in the Bar which was great..A lovely comfortable bar run by an extremely charming and very experienced Greek Bar Man who presented me with a box of choccies because it was his Birthday!! He was great craic also a lovely barmaid.Breakfast was plentiful and would definetly fill you up for a long day. Hot and cold food lovely scrambled eggs I would recommend highly .Hams salmon, sausages ,bacon ,cereals yoghurts, fruit lots of different breads and always kept topped up never run pout of food no matter what time we arrived for Breakfast.Excellent location across road from station walking distance to all attractions and shopping and in all honesty if you want to see red Light you will have to look very hard no matter how many different ways we came and went we never seen anything bad or seedy few specialist shops but they are in every city.Never afraid walking back at night.All in all I will definetly be back.The Staff employed by this hotel are the best I have ever dealt with and I dont make remarks like this lightly.

<Content>Great Stay Stayed overnight in May. Hotel is just across the street from the train station. If you need to escape the red light district a bridge across the river is approximately 200 meters away. While the area is close to the train station and in the supposed red light area it didn't feel unsafe at all. The hotel desk clerk was friendly and professional. The hotel itself was quite a surprise. From the outside it looks a tiny bit grimy but it's a different world beyond the main entrance. We had room 110 which was at the end of the hallway. It was large, airy, and quiet. It faced the back of the hotel and looked over a small park (?) in front of another hotel. The bed was a double and quite comfortable. The bathroom was clean and shiny (always a concern!) I was quite pleased with the accomodations. The breakfast at 9 euro wasn't spectacular but all-in-all it was a good stay and I would definitely book a room there again in the future.

<Content>Excellent hotel with good Internet access I was looking for a hotel near Frankfurt's Central Railway Station and was not disappointed. The lift was inoperable and carrying my bag was a bit of a pain up three long flights of stairs in this olde-worlde hotel with its giant staircase, but the room was adequate for a single traveller.Unlike some other reviewers, I experienced a quiet stay. Perhaps I was in luck.Breakfast was adequate. Perhaps because I was focused on coming in and leaving by train, I did not even notice the supposed 'red light' district.The manager was friendly and when the sole Internet terminal in the hotel failed, he opened the door of the hotel next door and allowed me to use it. All in all, a pleasant if brief stay and a hotel that while not four-star, is an acceptable 2.5 to 3 stars and deserves a repeat visit.

<Content>Good value mor money I selected this hotel based on reviews found in the internet and I wasn't disappointed.Location is great, just about 100 m from the Main Railway Station(Hauphtbahnhof). So if you come by train from the airport, is it only a couple of minutes walk to the hotel. I saw in some comments that this hotel is situated near the so called red light district. Well, only hints about that were a couple of shops in the Kaiserstrasse, but if you don't want to visit those places, nobody is dragging you there. I didn't see a single junkie during my four-day visit but I did saw nice places to have a quick bite at cheap price because there are a lot of ethnic takeaway bars and a very nice Irish pub.I had also read that rooms facing to the backyard are peaceful and I asked and get that kind of room. Room itself was pretty small but it was ok for one person. Some things would need fixing, for example bathroom door but it didn't fall apart so no problem.The breakfast was also very good and there's also a cozy bar downstairs with very friendly and smiling bartender. You can use internet free of charge in the lobby, it is handy to send for example e-cards.To put it short, nice hotel, not four-star level but a good tree and a half.

<Content>Great Value ...... our new favourite hotel in Frankfurt We (2 married couples, aged 40's/50's) have unanimously decided that we shall return to the National whenever we stay in Frankfurt in future.The location is excellent for the river, the train station and trams only make 3 stops until you are right in the heart of the old town and shopping areas.It was a huge surprise to find tea/coffee facilities in the room which is most unusual for European hotels and the overall standard is very good indeed. Our friends were in Room 124 which was at the front and slightly noisy if you are a light sleeper whilst our room (126) was to the back of the hotel and therefore was not at all noisy. Both were spacious, clean and very comfortable. There are also double doors to the rooms which is an excellent security feature.Breakfast was great - cereals, yoghurts, various breads, cheese, cold meats, smoked salmon, pate, jams, etc. as well as hot food such as sausages, eggs  beans. There was also a good selection of juices, teas and coffees.We have stayed previously at The Savoy, Continental,  Excelsior hotels which are all within a few yards of the National but will definitely stay here again on our next visit.

<Content>I would stay here again My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in Jan. The hotel room was amazing and we were very happy with our choice. We stayed in room 224, the room is spaciouse and very clean. We loved it. I also liked the decor of the hotel room, it is very classy. The hotel is also within walking distance to the downtown financial center. We hung out at downtown for two nights, there are a lot of of interesting places in that area. We will definitely come back to this hotel again.P.S. Our hotel room was facing the the main street so you may need to ask for a quiter room if you have sleeping problem.

<Content>Good Hotel - will stay there again I booked the National hotel because it had fairly good reviews on this website and the rooms were very competitively priced. Check in was fine, and the staff were very friendly all the way through my stay. It seems like quite an old hotel, and it may benefit from some renovation. The bathroom of the room looked pretty new, so maybe that was phase one of any renovation. The room had kettle and coffee making facilities and wireless LAN was reasonably priced, compared to other hotels. The location is also good, as it is right in the centre of Frankfurt. The one drawback may be the parking facilities. which consist of an alleyway at the side and back of the hotel, where cars are parked all in a line, so it could be fun getting out. Anyway, you have to leave your keys at reception for the porter to manoeuvre the cars during your stay. I liked the hotel - the staff were very friendly and it was in a good location and it was a good price. I will stay there again.

<Content>Nice and reasonably priced Very much a wonderful place for the price of about 84 euros/night. The beds are small, and consist of a twin bed, or two twins shoved together to make a larger bed. You may need to request an extra pillow or two. The bathroom shower is a bit strange, at least it was to this American (!), but the room and bathroom were cleaned daily with fresh towels provided. If you need a hair-dryer, bring your own, as the hotel-provided dryer looks to be circa-1975.If you have any problems with noise or smoke, DO NOT BOOK A ROOM ON THE 4TH FLOOR! Our room (425) was directly next to the hotel's conference rooms, and at meeting breaks, attendees crowd the hallways, talking during their coffee and cigarette breaks. The cigarette smoke smell never really went away.Other than that, everything was fabulous. Tatiana at the front desk was most accomodating (she let us check in 6 hours early on our first day), the free tea service and internet in the lobby were quite nice, and the buffet breakfast has a little something for everyone.Jen14221@hotmail.comP.S. The mini-bar is no longer free; everything costs 2 euros.

<Content>Loved the National This hotel is lovely. The rooms are cozy and very comfortable and the staff is very helpful. It's a block from the train station so it's very conveniently located and it offers free Internet access in the lobby. It was a great find. It's inexpensive and yet more comfortable than many expensive hotels I've stayed at. I and my partner left to travel to other cities for a couple days and were delighted to return to the National.

<Content>GREAT hotel I got there expecting the worst because it was close to the train station but I was quite surprised at what I found.The hotel is very close to the train station, is rated 4 stars, has free internet in the lobby, a free breakfast along with a service that lets you get a 'take-out' breakfast if you're in a hurry, and a free drink at the bar for each of the guests. The bartender was also VERY nice. I asked for a drink that wasn't on the free drink voucher (a Radler - half beer, half Sprite) and he gladly made it up. You are even given a mini-bar and the items in there are free. There's some water, a beer, a soda, and some apple juice. The room was very clean and had a double door (yes, that means 2 doors) so you feel even more safe if you're a single female traveling.To add to this, the room was HUGE which is quite strange for Europe. Even the bathroom was about twice the size of the bathrooms we had at other European hotels. There's also plenty of storage space in case you need to spread out and there's a little table with 2 chairs in the room for you to set up your dinner and eat there. For dinner, there are quite a few places to grab some food. There is an Indian restaurant that is next to the hotel that smelled AMAZING and a Doner kabab, pizza, and pasta restaurant next to the Indian place. However, we grabbed food at the train station before going to our hotel and there are tons of choices there - from sushi and chinese, to brats and potatoes. The hotel says they have room service but I didn't see a menu but we already had food.Anyway, my husband and I will gladly stay here again if we need a hotel in Frankfurt.

<Content>Close to Hauptbahnhof I booked a single room at the National for just one night.The Room is basic and a little on the small side but clean.They have a free Minibar with Beer/Water/Juice and Coke.Breakfast is fine but basic/Nothing 4 star.You would get the same at a 3 star property.The location is a little noisy as the Hotel is located at a busy road opposit the main station.Try not to stay on the first floor (too close to the road) and maybe ask for a room towards the rear.Staff is friendly / no complaints.Would stay again if no other option for my price range avail.

<Content>Dingy and uninspiring how on earth did this get classed as a 4 star?! more like a moderate 2 star I think. Booked a non smoking room, only to be told there were none left, room very dated and dingy, bathroom clean but drains smelt, and before you get excited about the 'free minibar', it contains one bottle of beer, water, and coke. Breakfast reasonable. Most staff super friendly, but others a bit surly.

<Content>Free Mini Bar !! After a 40-year absence from Germany (military brat), I arrived in Frankfurt anxious for a good sleep before meeting friends and our trip to the old Canadian base where we lived as teenagers. I had asked for a quiet non-smoking room, and predictably was given a tiny, closet-like street-front room full of smoke. A quick trip down to the desk got that sorted, with many smiles, and no problem. I was given a larger, quieter and sweet-smelling room overlooking a small courtyard at the back. The double bed was large and comfy, and the bathroom was all in white marble. Spotless white marble !! The TV had English, German and French stations, and - bonus! - the minibar was stocked and was free. A hot shower and a cold German beer and I was ready for my nap.They have a curious room door system - sort of an airlock set up. You unlock the door in the hallway, then open your room door which is behind the first door. This really keeps hallway noise out of your room at night, plus it's good for women travelling alone as both doors lock.Best bit - the breakfast room on the main floor is decked out in flowers everywhere, and waiters in tuxes keep the food coming. Best coffee I have ever had, anywhere.For dinner, I wandered over to the Hauptbahnhof nearby and found a delightful restaurant on its second floor (elevator available). It serves grand cru wines by the glass !! Formidable !!The National was 95 Euros per night with hot breakfast included.Good value, will stay there again.

<Content>A great 3 star The location is unbeatable. This is a corporate hotel.It is a bit run down and in no way, should be considered a 4 star (as they claim). On arrival, our room was definitely not-yet-serviced, so we asked for another room. No probs aside from that. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a well located 3 star.

<Content>acceptable, but not all that Decor is very art-deco, and as such the place has a very strange kind of comfort feel about it. I think you would have to be very into the style of furnishings to really love the place.stayed two nights in a twin-bed room august.Rooms are clean and similarly furnished... but comfortable and convenient rather than their extravigant exteriors. Quite a poor view.The bar is certainly above average, and one of the better points about the hotel. Location is quite convenient - just a block from Central BahnHof (station). The area of town isn't particularly Joyous ( alittle rough), but again everything seems to be quite close. some good resturants nearby.But for the 4 and a half-star rating they give; I've had worlds better.

<Content>You Get What You Pay For As stated in other reviews the Hotel is located opposite the Main train station an ok location..a 20 minute walk to the main shopping and nightlife areas..you do pass the red light area which may be a little daunting to some. The hotel I would realistically say was 3 star if you expect a 4 star pristine property this is not the hotel for you. I stayed here in April and the outside temperature was only 58 and yet the room was very stuffy and that was with the heating off I would imagine during the warmer months it must be unbearable as there is no air con. The staff were friendly and the breakfast was mediocre. All in all having paid only 72 Euros BB via the hotels own web site I would have to say You Get What You Pay For Nothing More Nothing Less!!!
