<Content>Great location and price! We stayed in a family room (4 adults) for 2 nights. The room was HUGE! It was in a 'L' shape with a window at one end, fridge, desk and TV. There were 2 double beds and one single. The double beds were placed so you couldn't see each other - good for privacy. Big double wardrobe. The bathroom was huge - our only problem was the shower. It had disabled access and just a shower curtain seperating from the rest of the room. This resulted in wet floors - bit slippy but no real problem. Shower is a rainforest head type - you can't move it so you get your hair wet (unless you wear the cap provided).Location is good. Couple of minutes to Central Station/Buses. Less than $2 on bus to get to Circualr Quay. 10 mins walk to China Town and Darling Harbour.Our only problem was the noise from the air con system. It was quite loud and went on all the time. Constant banging and clicking.I'd stay again though - can't beat the price!

<Content>Good Value with Few Faults I would echo most of the previous positive comments. Our room was a little over A$700 for a week through Wotif and we got a fairly spacious room one floor up from reception with a good view of the street and no traffic noise (I guess the configuration of rooms varies widely in this strange shaped building). There are plenty of bus and train options nearby and I never felt anything but safe even on Regent Street as you are very close to Broadway which was busy even very late.Staff were always helpful and the room was clean and well serviced. We were able to store our extensive baggage (bike boxes and regular cases) on the last day for as long as we required. They even called the day before we arrived to tell us that the elevator was out of order in case that was a problem (and it was fixed soon after our arrival).The only real negatives were a slow elevator (the security system requires swiping your key to make it move after waiting a while for the doors to close) and the ridiculous price for internet (go around the corner to Everywhere Internet on Broadway: clean, comfortable and A$1.50-2/ hour). I recommend the place and would certainly stay again.

<Content>Great value for what I paid Stayed here with a fantastic price on a secret deal on what turned out to be the busiest weekend in Sydney since the Olympics. Rooms are small but have been done up very nicely, same with the bathrooms. Was excited to get the top floor, until I found the window looked out onto a brick wall, but the way the building is, not many rooms would have a view. Location was good, not far from the rail station, easy walk to Chiinatown, or cheap bus fare to the Rocks etc. Found the desk staff very helpful and friendly. For what I paid, it was excellent value for money.

<Content>Central location Cheap deal via secret hotel booking site. Location is just off the Central train station. It's a little quiet at night as it's the only business open on this short street so it might frighten single travellers although your feeling of safety may be more based on perception than reality as Sydney is quiet safe.Hotel has limited front desk hours. Modern boutique like features but a limited service hotel for sure. My room was a cheap secret hotel so may have been not one of the better ones. Although clean and functional with a small LCD TV, I didn't have any windows! Hallways are institutional. New card locks is good. Comfortable bed. Rooms are clean. Small soap bars.

<Content>Central, Clean and well located Stayed in a twin room for 3 nights and found the hotel to be good for the price (especially in Sydney) and impressed with how clean the rooms were. The Location is good as close to the central station so easy to get around Sydney.

<Content>Affordable, comfortable and good location Stayed in a twin room for 3 nights, and this hotel was absolutely fine.We arrived quite late after reception had closed, and the receptionist had phoned earlier in the day to give us instructions on how to get into the hotel and get our key out of the key safe. This all worked fine with no problems at all.Room was an unusual shape (long and thin), but perfectly acceptable with twin beds, a large desk area, wardrobes, tea and coffee facilities and an extensive range of TV channels. Bathroom was very small, but certainly adequate. Hotel provided a guest laundry.Location is good. It's in the CBD, very close to the Central railway station where you can both local subway trains and regional services to places like the Blue Mountains.Stayed in this place because my favourite Sydney hotel, which is more centrally located, was full. While I would still go for my favourite hotel on future trips to Sydney, if it were again full then I would have no hesitation in staying here again as my second choice.

<Content>Totally not what we expected. Not really a Hotel, seemed more like a renovated college dorm room. Room is pretty small area lighting is very poor. The bathroom is smaller than pictures posted could indicate. The toilet is right up against the side of the bathroom with no space to sit down, properly. Also note, you have to badge in  out to get in/out of the hotel after 9pm, there is no one at the front desk. Location close to Central railway--off the main street--close to China town. We were not able to adjust the air conditioner settings. According to the front desk the whole building is air-conditioned at the same temperature...no changes. Felt like we were going to catch a cold. After staying there for one night we cancelled our reservations  paid the extra one night cancellation fee (booked through check-in.com). Enjoy.

<Content>Clean, comfortable, friendly  Looked at Sydney hotel prices [anyone know why Australian hotels are so expensive for what you get ?] read the Trip Advisor reviews on this one and booked on their web site.Great to deal with, very friendly - room was fairly small but very clean  comfortable - really good value for money.There's a full laundry room downstairs with washer, drier  iron - $3 each machine  iron is free.Can park at the Mercur if like us you have a rental car.Excellent breakfast at Wake Up ! - a little coffee bar just beyond the place where the buses stop, fresh fruit, yogurt  great coffee, and good Italian food for dinner at Sopranos, just east of the station..Recomended to anyone who wants somewhere convenient  very good value in Sydney...

<Content>clean, good deal we were looking for a cheap place but not a hostel and this worked out great. located a bit south of the harbour but certainly within walking distance, maybe 30-40mins? its right off the main streets so as you walk to the harbour there is plenty of shopping and cafes to keep you busy, or you can take a 3min walk to the central train station and go from there.the rooms are small, but get it done. a bathroom with shower, toilet, full size bed, and little 20 lcd tv with several channels. this is not really the place to stay for lounging, more like somewhere to just put your stuff in and sleep. while we were there, the a/c was pretty noisey, but a call to the front desk seemed to get it working better. overall there seemed to be lack of air circulation since our wet clothes (bathing suits) never seemed to beable and dry inside the room. the rooms themselves seem secure, you need to card access the lobby at night, then card access in the elevator to get to your floor, so that gave a safe feeling. in your room, you could definetely hear ppl in the hallways through your door, but the walls seemed to insulate, once noisey ppl went into their rooms and shut their doors you could never hear them.if youre looking for a cheap, clean, safe place and not too worried about being further from the harbour action, this is the place for you.

<Content>It's ok It was ok. Room was clean and tidy. Staff were friendly. Good for holiday, but not good for business as the wireless internet was expensive and there was no iron in the room. It's very close to the train station which is handy, but there are a few dodgy people around the area at night.

<Content>Great hotel This hotel is an excellent value in central sydney... I paid just over US$100/night but the place was spotlessly clean, completely new, great sunshine in the room (with drapes open) and quiet. I am a business traveler and am very particular, and I can wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to business or pleasure travelers. I must say that it is NOT in the center of the CBD, but a short bus/taxi ride or a 20 minute walk. Please note that there is an early (and strict) check out time of 10am, and there is no luggage storage (although exceptions can be made, it seems). Also, the internet charge in the hotel is high (as is the rest of Sydney) - try Boingo instead, and save a lot. Barbara, who works at the front desk, is very kind and helpful.

<Content>So Blessed After getting ejected by our hotel as the city was FULL we found this hotel that just opened. The location was next to the railway station. Never in our life have we had such wonderful people look after our needs. The rooms where small but the bed was ahh so comfortable. The lack of city noise and darkness in the room contributed to the really great sleep. We also missed half a day playing tourist as we stayed in and watched Animal planet. MY Husband and i really enjoyed the second half of our holiday in ths property, being ejected from a 4.5 star property to this 3.5 star was the best thing. I would stay here every time we come to sydney without fail and will recommend it to friends as well unashamedly.

<Content>Lovely Quiet Quality Hotel I have had the pleasure to stay at this hotel twice in the past few months and was very impressed with it. The staff are very friendly, the hotel is very clean and quiet and so close to all in the city.The location being next to Central Railway Station is an asset and make it very easy to get to all locations whilst on holidays.The renovations to this hotel have made it nice and fresh with quality fittings and a pleasure to spend time in.

<Content>we like it however,we stayed in this hotel for only 2 days, i think it is very good place to stay in Sydney, near central station. It looks like it has been renovated recently, so everything is new and in very good condition. As far as i can jadge, it is convinient and comfortable enought for this price. In additon, the staff was friendly.Overall i would say this is good hotel and it worth to stay there and enjoy your staying.

<Content>The Central Regent Hotel is a wonderful experience I had a delightful experience with both the people and the room at the Central Regent Hotel. I was looking for a budget standard room for a layover in trains and the Central Regent was a great hotel for that. The staff were very helpful and accomodated me both prior to check in and post check out.I would highly recommend this hotel to any traveller.Debby MarshallCalgary, Alberta Canada

<Content>New, Clean, Friendly Hotel A pleasant, new and very clean hotel, absolute value for money. Fantastic hotel for business travellers all rooms have WiFi. As a females travelling alone, I felt very save there. Staff were very helpful, friendly. I was able to check in early. Within walking distance to the Central Station and bus station, Powerhouse Museum, TAFE etc. Room was small, but tasteful, comfortable and functional, and smelled fresh. The bed was bliss. The hotel, though central, is quiet, and I got a good night sleep.The bathroom was superclean / spotless. Would definitely come back.

<Content>Friendly smal hotel Great service - I arrived well before check in time having got up very early to catch my flight. As my room had been vacated already they arranged for my room to be the first to be cleaned. This meant that I could go away, have some breakfast and then come back and catch up on some much needed sleep well before normal check in time.

<Content>Fantastic We stayed in this new hotel in the beginning of October for two nights. We found the staff to be very pleasant and unobtrusive and the lobby and room secure and quiet.The room appears exactly as it looks on the website and the bed was firm but comfortable and the double glazed windows blocked out all the noise of the station and city streets below. Initially we had a little trouble finding the hotel, as this was our first time to Sydney, we had a car, and Regent St isn't very well marked on the two maps we used. So for further reference the hotel is on a part of Regent St that is an extension of Harris St. We found resonibly priced parking on Thomas St off Quay St approx $18 per 24 hours which was cheaper than the recommended carpark of $25 per 24 hours. We dropped off our bags at the hotel (4 hr parking out front) and then leisurely drove the car round and left it in the carpark for 2 days. The area has some great asian food and felt safe and active at night when we returned to the hotel. The location next to the station made it very easy to navigate around the city on a day tripper pass.We found the decor modern, tasteful and very very clean and the only critism would be that a bedside table would be convenient and perhaps the flat screen tv would be more easily visible if mounted on the wall - oh, and a cd player would be nice but not essential!We will definiely stay here again.

<Content>New Hotel The staff at this new hotel were friendly, and had an interest in their guests - always a positive. As for the room (double bed room), it was very tiny, the bed took up much of the room. Bed and shower facilities were brand new, and excellent. The LCD television screen was a delight as well.One thing I found disappointing about the hotel was the lack of amenities and in-room facilities. Due to the location of this hotel, there is no option of expansion in the way of restaurants, gym, sauna, pool, etc. I suppose that is a trade off with the excellent proximity to Central Station. That's understandable. However, I was disappointed that there was no in-room information on television channels, wireless access, reception details, local shops and services - the usual brochures and such. Very happy with the last minute price I got, but would consider my options a little more if I were to pay full price. Despite the lack of extra facilities, I was happy with my stay at the Central Regent.
