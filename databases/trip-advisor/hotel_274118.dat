<Content>Charming hotel, great location! This was our 2nd stay in 2 years. It has an ideal location, central to the city and most modes of transportation. We were able to walk to almost everything, and used the Metro or taxis for everything else.Yes, the rooms are smallish, but, hey, it's Europe! And they are very well furnished. If you want an American hotel, go to the Hilton. For us the buffet was ideal for breakfast and snacks. I especially liked the self-service cafe con leche and the fresh fruit. I probably wouldn't eat dinner there, but given the endless variety of restaurants and cafes nearby, I wouldn't eat at the hotel anyway.The staff are extraordinary. We felt that they very much enjoyed their jobs and helping us learn about their beautiful city. I have never seen hotel staff laugh so much when dealing with guests.

<Content>Would recommend based on location Stayed for 5 nights in September 2007.Location: Excellent. Surrounded by shops and restaurants. Liked that it was located slightly further up from the busiest shopping/restaurant area (hotel is in a more upscale part of the strip, less crowded, felt safer). Quick walk to the metro/bus/tourist office.Room: Extremely small. Barely fit two suitcases. Tiny bathroom. Covered in pink. Low ceiling. Everything was fairly clean though. Food: 24 hour buffet. I was hesitant to eat the cooked stuff so I didn鈥檛, but everything I did have was great (e.g., fresh fruit, bread, tomatoes, pastries, cereal, etc.). You get free bottled water, cans of pop, wine, beer, and milk. Saved a lot of money on breakfast and bottled water.Breakfast room: Fantastic. We ate our breakfast on the outdoor patio every day. Bought dessert from the nearby bakery every night and ate out there as well.Front Desk: Extremely helpful. Gave us all kinds of tips on where to eat, where to go, etc. Overall: We paid 130 Euros a night and thought it was excellent value for such a central location in the nicer part of the strip. Close to all public transport as well, plus the free breakfast and bottled water. Would recommend without hesitation 鈥?just know your room will be tiny.Note: I would highly recommend going to see Parc Guell, and doing a day trip to Montserrat.

<Content>Loved this hotel! We stayed two days pre-cruise and enjoyed every minute. The beds are a little too firm and the rooms are very pink, but the hotel is a gem!The rooms are small and I wouldn't recommend a long term stay but it's perfect for a couple of days when you're trying to pack in as many sites as possible.The 24 hour buffet was a disappointment but we did manage breakfast reasonably well. We found the coffee undrinkable (it sure wasn't Dunkin Donuts) but the tea was fine and grabbing a bottle of water on the way out the door and a can of beer and some nuts when we came back in was very convenient.The staff all spoke excellent English and we were able to check email using one of the two PC's available for guests. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again!

<Content>Most welcoming and friendly This hotel was recommended by a friend who enjoyed the free wine that was availalbe! We enjoyed the warm Catalonyan welcome, the attention to details in the chintzi pink bedroom and the location being 5 -10 mins walk to 2 Gaudi designed houses, place Catalyni (main square). la Rambla. There is no kitchen or dining room, but the hel yourself inclusive buffet is available 24hrs a day and includes cerals, fruit, breads and croissants, salads, meat casseroles, mixed veg. and potatoes. All sorts of drinks - coffees tea, hot choc. Fridge with soft drinks and beers. microwaves available to heat up the food. Fridge and microwave in the en suite room. We were advised to upgrade to a larger room (167 euro/night) by our friends and still the room was just big enough. There were 2 computers with internet access and we were offered WiFi but we didn't need it. We would recommend the Pallacette Continetal to anyone and will use it again.

<Content>Triple Room - Disappointed We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights post cruise. We were 3 adults and contacted the hotel directly about accommodating us in a triple room. They suggested a Versalles Room (with Versalles Salon) which was for a Queen Bed and an additional 50 Euros for an extra bed. We arrived quite early in the morning and the Front Desk was extremely helpful and accommodating to us. We were provided with a room to leave our luggage to enable us to start exploring Barcelona. Upon returning to the hotel in the early evening and actually seeing the room, I must say I was shocked at how small the Versalles room and bathroom area was. The extra bed ended up being a cot the size a child would sleep on and less than 1 foot off the floor. It was placed in the Versalles Salon area. Our room did not get cleaned and so by 5:30 p.m. we complained to the Front Desk and they immediately arranged for it to be cleaned. We were put in Room 139 - If you end up with this room please try to have it changed. It is right next to the lounge/dining area. The walls are paper thin and you can hear the television and people talking as well. The Salon area was a large size and the windows opened up for a nice view to the outside. Yes, the hotel is located in a very good location and also provides free WiFi access, and offered a 24 hour buffet. The buffet did not look good and we were afraid to eat anything from it, although we did have refreshments. I would not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Loved the Continental Palacete 8 of us stayed at this hotel, from September 12 to the 14th, 2008. We had several types of rooms, and every room was excellent. Some were larger than others, ours had a lovely step down window with two chairs and a table. It was called the Tribune Room. The lovely sitting area with the open windows to the street, was excellent. Yes, this hotel has very pink rooms but only adds to the quaintness of it. We enjoyed it very much, the location was great, the 24 hour buffet with wine and beer, water, soft drinks and food was excellent for a quick snack. The few days we were here, were pre-cruise days and many couples we met were also staying there for the same reason. This hotel was close to everything. We thought the management were excellent and very accomodating, even when they had to refill the white wine pump several times during our stay. We would highly recommend this quaint hotel, and would definitely want to stay here again. Its very secure, has a great lift system for taking your luggage up to your room and feels very luxurious. The price is good as well, and all of our 4 couples had a wonderful stay.

<Content>Disappointing Superior room too small with no natural light and very low ceiling,not suitable for claustrophobic people. Breakfast ok except for paper plates and cups and plastic cutlery. Very clean and staff pleasant. Local Restaurant Barkeno on Carrer de Casp recommended by hotel was absolutely horrible. Christine

<Content>Wonderful Could not have asked for a better place to stay during our visit to Barcelona. The small hotel is ideally located near the Plaza Catalunya, where the airport bus teminates and the central tourist office is located. The room was spotless, the bed firm, the staff incredibly helpful. The hotel provides a 24 hour buffet bar with food and beverages available at no extra cost to guests and a lovely lounge area in which to enjoy them. I have already recommended the hotel to potential visitors to Barcelona.

<Content>Most Helpful Staff! Nine of us including 3 children ages 9-13 stayed here 2 nights pre-cruise. We had a Sun room, Tribune room, and Versailles room. As previous reviews have stated, the rooms are very pink and the Versaille bedroom is tiny, but it is the most charming hotel and the staff was wonderful! The buffet was ok...children didn't like anything but the fresh fruit. The selection of drinks and bottled water was fantastic. After our cruise, we stayed at another hotel closer to the airport. The next day we took the metro into the Plaza. My brother was pickpocketed. He lost all his Euros, credit cards, driver's license and passport! We went to the Palacete to retrieve something we had left from our stay the previous week. Upon hearing about my brother's misfortune, Peter at the front desk insisted we sit down and have something to drink and he helped bro with contacting authorities and interpreting for him! Peter went well beyond any expectation we had. He is to be commended for his stellar service!We will definately stay at this hotel when we return to Barcelona

<Content>Loved The Continental Palacete in Barcelona The Cintinental Palacete is a lovely place to stay. The furnishings are definitely out of the ordinary and I just thought it was the best. The location is wonderful, convenient to all you will want to see or do.In September i am returning for a few days before another trip and am anxious to be back in the warm, inviting atmosphere.

<Content>Great "quirky" little hotel We stayed here 3 nights pre- cruise, and met up with fellow cruisers here. The location was great, close to Plaza Catalunya, where the Aerobus stops. Staff were friendly, 24- hour buffet, while hardly outstanding, certainly worked well, especiallyfor drinks and snacks after a long day of touring. Free internet was a bonus. The tiny pink room with firm beds was spotlessly clean, and the bathroom was well laid out. We noticed absolutely no noise from other rooms, and the little elevator for luggage was certainly an experience. The price was attractive compared to others in the area, and the amenities made this a winner for us!

<Content>Not what it cracks up to be Don't be taken in by the photo of the person on a balcony looking onto Las Ramblas - that is the wrong hotel. The Palacette is located a good 15 minute walk from Las Ramblas and you have to do this walk every time you go out. Be prepared to carry your luggage up that first flight of stairs - there is no lift. Buffet is not good and does not change for breakfast. Rooms are small, and VERY pink, but I paid more for an exterior room only to get one that did not have a balcony so therefore could not open the window. The lounge is beautiful but is always full and is the only public room. Look elswhere if you want to experience Barcelona, somewhere on Las Ramblas or in the Gothic area.

<Content>Ideal location and warm welcom Ended up in this hotel by chance. Stayed in one of the Versailles rooms, which we got at the cheaper room rate for 2 nights with my wife.Hotel is family owned and very welcoming and friendly.Some rooms are small but are very clean and tidy.24 hour buffet available, which is nice, but a little repetitive if I was staying longer. Amble wine and beer you can help yourself to.Location is excellent short walk from Catyluna train station and the Ramblas down from the hotel and the shops up from the hotel.If I return to Barcelona I will certainly look first at this hotel

<Content>Very Good OK - it's very pink (apart from the green bits) + the rooms are not massive.This is a good, clean hotel in a very good location. The staff were friendly and helpful and overall I think it is very good value for money.Room had a safe, fridge and microwave - all very useful.The food on the buffet was not exceptional, but it was excellent to be able to help yourself to a drink or a snack at any time of the day or night.Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>great location, where are all the British? November 2 nd 2007We are still staying at the hotel, having booked for 5 nights. I booked an outside room after reading adverse reviews about the inside rooms. However the room was not available for the length of our stay so we had to spend 2 nights in an inside room.inside room, 233. This was small but had a small window opening onto an inside courtyard, It was clean and comfortable. We were so happy we wanted to stay there but were told we had to move since the room was reserved after our 2 nights. The hotel was full of people mainly going on cruises and mainly Americans.Outside room 137. This was not much bigger but has a covered balcony facing the main road. We had no sleep all night because the road was so noisy. We had to ask to change again and this time were given another room for the last 2 nights.room 129. This had a small window situated at the back. Hopefully it will be quieter. All the rooms were similarly furnished in pink and were very clean and well equiped.The location is perfect. The nearest metro is the Passeig de Gracia which is first left out of the hotel. The buffet has kept us satisfied for snacks and breakfast and we also used the Tapas bar in Cuidad Condal which was very good. We went to a good Flamenco, Opera show in a theatre just at the start of the Ramblas on the right hand side going down the street. We made good use of the Barcelona card too.Enjoy

<Author>LondonStagman
<Content>Mixed feelings but very clean We stayed for 4 nights and the hotel decor in some rooms is a bit of a shock. We struggled to get anywhere that had either 4 in a room - 2 kids, or an adjoining room anywhere in Barcelona. The hotel offered us a room with attached lounge but ommitted to tell us the actual bedroom is a small triangular cupboard off the lounge! It also faces the main road and is noisy at night. Get the right room, prepare for garish colours and you will have a very clean hotel with very friendly service.Beware room 139 with Versailles lounge. Room 137 that we had for the first night should tick all the boxes.Great location and the tapas bar 70-80 metres straight ahead towards the Ramlas, is an amazing restaurant.

<Content>redressing the balance Somewhat quirky and pink I'll give you but how you can rate this hotel so low is beyond me!!!Remember this a very old buliding - it is not an Ameriacan new build hotel. The rooms are small by US standards but are more than comparable to other European cities - the situation is superb, just off the tourist traps - Ramblas etc yet within a few minutes walk of Plaza Catalunya. I would say that the majority of guests stay just a few days on a City Break and for that purpose the Hotel is just great. The all day buffet is a nice touch especially the fresh fruit with free coffee cold drinks beer and wine on tap.For a few days in Barcelona this Hotel is certainly worth a try - OK you could spend a fortune and get better rooms but value for money and helpful staff its a gem.Try the Tapas at Ciudad Condal halfway to the Pla Catalunya - great- some say beat in Barcelona!!!!We would certainly go back.

<Content>Beds are hard as a rock! Positive: A great location and the buffet comes in handy for a snack and for breakfast. The lounge area is nice and has balconies that you can sit and watch the street life. They have free internet in the lobby which is convenient too. Negative: The decor is very over the top and if you love hot pink then this is your place. We orginally got a interior room which was not acceptable, way too small for 2 people with luggage and it smelled. We upgraded to the Tribune Suite so that we would be more comfortable, so we thought. The bed was the MOST uncomfortable bed that I had ever slept on. I asked the hotel and all the beds are the same so we could not switch rooms again. Thank god we only stayed two nights here and we wont be back again.

<Content>value for money. i cant see what the problems are about the inside room. i tried to upgrade before i went, when i read about the room. ITS PINK SO WHAT. i spent very little time inside the room and a lot of time on the balcony eating and drinking the free food and drink. the red wine is not great but the white wine and the cans of lager are ok, especially when we sat on la rambla and had 2 pints of lager and a coke, 17 euro,s what a rip of. yet you can sit on the fantastic balcony watching the world go by is fantastic. the room i had was the cheapest, but like i say, i couldnt upgrade as the hotel was full. so i went not knowing what to expect. the room was not a bad size and it did have a window, which sort of opened up to a tiny inside court yard. you can still see daylight, but only just. my son had a single room for 95 euro,s which was a good size with a comfertable double bed. everywhere else i tried to book for him as a single cost a fortune. this hotel was value for money. even the staff were nice, peter and pili. are 2 names i can remember. there was even postcards of the hotel that are free and they even stamp them and send them of free, there is free internet. i would reccomend this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel unless you have interior room We stayed at the hotel for six nights the last week of April and would have loved the hotel if not for being unable to book or upgrade to an exterior room. All of the previous reviews accurately expound on the wonderful features of the property, including the extensive convenience and value of the buffet, the beautiful sitting/dining room, the helpfulness of the staff, and the excellent location. Prior to booking I read reviews that warned that interior rooms should be avoided. I should have heeded the reviews and booked another hotel when I was told that none of the exterior rooms were available. There was absolutely no problem with noise (as stated in some reviews). The beds were very comfortable. The bathrooms were very good by European standards. But when the rooms are described as small, this isn't just small by European standards. Our room literally only fit the bed and two tiny plastic nightstands (the room was equipped with a king size bed----it would have been better with a full). Although there is a patio, it doesn't provide much more space, light or air as the patio is more of a boxed-in cell---no view, no window, no air.In spite of daily attempts to upgrade, we were unable to move as Barcelona was Hopping that week.In sum, unless you truly do not care about the room itself, this hotel is a great choice.If you want to stay in room that is at least a small room by European standards, do not stay here unless an exterior room is available. You will be disappointed (but not surprised). If we had heeded the warning on trip advisor, we would have simply booked at another hotel.So, take the reviews seriously....after three weeks in Europe and eight different hotels, we found the reviews absolutely accurate.

<Content>What a find! After following Trip Advisor, I booked a 4-night break here and then up-graded to a Sol room to enjoy a view over the street, which was great especially on St. Jordi's day. The hotel lived up to and surpassed expectations.The staff were friendly and helpful, the all-day buffet was great and the room (although small) was very comfortable. The buffet was a real benefit as we would often return to the hotel for a rest, in the day, and then snack on the buffet or have a drink on the balcony overloking the street. It's location was excellent and I would definitely recommend it.

<Content>great hotel We have just returned from a visit to this hotel, We chose it because we thought it looked a bit different from the usual city hotel. We were right. We (2 couples in our 50's) loved it. From the welcome at the reception...by Peter..he personally showed us to our rooms, then we were shown the buffet. I have to say that I had seen this mentioned on this site and thought.ok. a coffee and snacks...but I was very wrong. There is lots of fresh fruit. rolls, eggs etc. at breakfast, but also 24 hour drinks, meat, fruit, rice and other dishes you can warm up in microwaves. We found this very handy because the weather was awful...lots of rain. So we went out between showers and snacked and relaxed at the hotel. The rooms are very pink but vaery comfortable. we faced the street. i don't know what the inner rooms are like. The lounge where you sit and eat is fabulous. I have never eaten in such a beautiful room. The pictures don't do it justice. It is in a good location, very near the Ramblas but far enough away to be quiet at night. We would certainly go againas we missed so much in the bad weather.

<Content>What a deal! This hotel is a gem....got a great deal online and was worth every euro! The 24 hour buffet was well worth it for the beverages alone! After a long day of touring, what a relief to return to the hotel and guzzle diet cokes, water, beer or wine--all FREE! There was always one hot entree--spinach quiche, potato frittata, etc., plus fruit, rolls, etc. all day long....and the chocolate! Wow! The room we had was small and on the third floor so the ceilings were low--if you're tall, request one of the high-ceilinged rooms on the two lower floors--but since we only slept there, who cares! The room was clean and very PINK--but if you want a Howard Johnson or a Holiday Inn, please stay in the STATES! The quirkyness was definitely European--the general graciousness of the renovated palace was reflected in the marble fireplace, the gilded decorations, the statuary, etc.I'm tired of listening to Americans complain about European facilities....if you travel overseas, enjoy what European cities have to offer--don't compare it to America! (have lived overseas for 24 years and am loving every minute!)

<Content>A real gem! We were a little nervous about booking this hotel because it looked a little dated and gaudy in the internet pictures, but what a surprise. Yes the decor is a little much, but the service was outstanding. The staff could not be more helpful. We had the Versaille room which was spacious for three although the bathroom was small. The 24 buffet was terrific. The location is fabulous to the city tour buses, Las Ramblas and great shopping. All in all it was a wonderful stay.

<Content>It's all good! We were just staying one night pre-cruise and booked the Palacete the last minute before departing Canada. What a gem! After two weeks of 3 star hotels in Europe, we weren't expecting too much. The Palacete was far and away the best hotel we stayed in!The decor is decidedly feminine, but not as over-the-top as I was expecting. The room was very comfortable: good beds (got a triple), good air conditioning, and the bathroom was spacious and clean with a decent sized bathtub and a bidet as well as toilet, sink, shower. We also had our own minifridge and microwave, although the offerings in the buffet made it unnecessary to hoard away our own breakfast/lunch foods. Ah, the buffet! What a pleasant surprise! Hot foods, fresh fruit, nuts, sweets, a cappucino/espresso machine...even fresh lemon thoughtfully provided for your tea! There are two computer terminals where you can access the internet free. The breakfast room is very lovely and has small balcony tables as well as larger ones inside the room. The Ramblas starts about a block away (must say that was a disappointment after all the postings...just a hoard of tourists on a pedestrian boulevard with some mimes and a few folks selling live birds and goldfish) so we had no problem at all with noise coming into the room.My one reservation...you do have to lug your bags up a short flight of stairs off the street to reach the teeny tiny elevator that will take you to the lobby proper. The elevator was a hair-raising experience for me...when we checked out I just put my bags in it and met them downstairs!

<Content>Very nice We stayed there 1 night post cruise in May. We had a nice size room and bathroom, and the air conditioning was welcome. Even though I like flowers and pink, the decor was almost too much for even me. The sitting rooms are very nice, though, and there are small tables on the little balcony which overlooks Las Ramblas. There is a light buffet which was stocked 24 hours, as well as soft drinks, water, beer, wine. It was a short walk to the Bus Turista stop . The staff was very helpful. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>a gem! We have just returned from a short break in Barcelona.Our stay in this wonderful city was made all the more pleasant by this hotel.It is in a wonderful position,central to many of the sights.It is spotlessly clean and the staff are very helpful and friendly.The 24hr buffet is such an amazing amenity and the lounge is lovely to rest in for a few moments after a long day of sightseeing.Rooms are a little small but everything else more than compensates for this.We would stay there again and can recommend this hotel with confidence.

<Content>5 night As posted in othter review, the decorating is unique, but as far as I am concerned that added to the charm and fun of staying at this hotel. It was nice to have access to food and beverages throughout the day. also the internet in the lobby was very convenient. we had to change rooms and were given a bottle of wine for our inconvenience. We liked the location out of the hustle and bustle of the rambla area, but still convenient. I liked the fact the room had plenty of light and places to put things when we unpacked. I enjoyed meeting other guests in the sitting room but one could certainly choose not to be social if desired. The entire staff was helpful. Great place. It did take my husband a bit of time to adjust to the decor - but not a big deal

<Content>charming!!!!!!!!!!!! Lovely!!!! I stayed here for 6 nigths and enjoyed everything. Food was good but it needs a little more choices, if you stay more than 3 days you may get tired of the same (if you are on a budget like I was can't complain). But I have to say that I enjoy the beds, staff always eager to help, close to everything, very clean. I loved that I paid my bill ahead of time and didnt have to worry of any extra charges (only paid 5 euros at check-out for the phone calls). The only problem I encounter was that I have to climb the stair with my heavy suitcase. When I arrived I try to use the lift to go up but was not able to, I still wondering if I was doing something wrong but I didnt get an answer on the phone provided at the bottom of the lift. The day that I left the counter attendant help me with it. Overall and for the price and the service, I recomend this charming hotel.

<Content>Charming We stayed here a night before our cruise. We found it very comfortable. Yes, the rooms are small, but who goes to Barcelona to stay in the room? It's not the Marriott. I'm sorry I didn't get her name, but the young woman at the front desk was very helpful and spoke English very well - lucky for us not-so-great Spanish speakers. She was wonderful. The free internet access was great. The location of this hotel was great - right up from Las Ramblas. Unbelievable - there's a Starbucks on nearly every corner in Barcelona - enjoy the local cafes instead...Cafe con leche!

<Content>Great for pre and post cruise stay We were a bit taken aback when entering the hotel to see the ver small and interesting self servew elevator. With lots of cruise luggage and 6 adults, it was a comical event to fill the elevator with luggage and send it up to the person awaiting at the top of the stairs. When we checked in with the very helpful Maria, we were able to store our luggage and have a snack at the included buffet while we waited for our rooms to be cleaned. Room (cheapest rate) was small and dark - looked out on an interior mini-patio. Very clean, cute room with good bathroom facilities, microwave and small closet. Very adequate for a 2 night stay when all we did was sleep and change in the room. Would spring for a larger room with window if staying longer next time. Staff was very friendly and helpful, food always available, free Internet access on two computers - one at the desk and one in the hallway near the buffet. We had a very pleasant stay and plan to return in March when we will be staying for a few days prior to a week in Mallorca. Definitely recommend

<Content>Great buffet We stayed at the Continental Palacete for two nights in November following a Med cruise. I agree that the free buffet and nice sitting area cannot be beat (try the chocolate covered walnuts). The free internet is a welcome bonus. Our room was rather small for three people; however, the bathroom was a decent size. I did notice that there is a wide range of room sizes, and ours was the smallest I saw. The best room I saw was the suite located right off the sitting room (strangely enough, there is a door right off the public sitting room that goes into the sitting area of the suite.) Our honeymooning friends had that room and it was lovely - definitely worth the few extra dollars they paid for it.The hotel's location is excellent, and within walking distance of many popular sites. The sightseeing buses can be caught just two blocks away.This hotel is a great value and I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Where was the elevator? We stayed at the hotel 1 night post cruise. It is a well located hotel with a charming sitting room and free internet access. I think I read someone describe it as Laura Ashley gone wild, and that was a good description.When I booked this hotel I asked them if they had an elevator and they answered yes. Well, it is about 12 steps to the elevator which takes you to the lobby. There is no one to help you in the lower lobby with your luggage. Then they put us in a room on the second floor. There is no elevator to the second floor. When we arrived at the steps, I asked if they had a room available on the main floor and they said no. So we shlepped our cruise luggage upstairs. On the way in that night, I asked them to tell the manager that it was not a good idea to put people who ask if there is an elevator on the upper floor. About an hour later we were woken from sleep with an offer to change our room. Gee thanks! We were only there for one night.I felt safe leaving my luggage.The desk staff spoke English and were helpful.Free internet access.Free drinks all day was a nice touch.The room was flowery and charming.The bed was hard.Good location. 2 Gaudi buildings only a few blocks away.No elevator.

<Content>Great hotel Hotel Continental Palacete is a wonderful hotel that exceeded my expectations. Location is perfect--within walking distance of many attractions, close to plaza catalunya, good restaurants, and the buses/trains. Hotel is very clean, helpful staff, very nice rooms and very reasonable (130 euros/night). The 24 hour buffet was very nice, especially the free San Miguel beer and the chocolate covered walnuts(forget the wine). The free internet and postcards were also nice pluses. The rooms are soundproof, several outside rooms have balconies, and all the bathrooms are very spacious and nice.

<Content>Princesses at the Palace We stayed with our two young daughters for four nights and thought this hotel was just right for us! 24-hr buffet is terrific for kids, decor is fun, rooms very clean and comfortable. Exterior Sun Room with two cots did not seem too crowded for us. This location is unbeatable. We recommend Tablao Cordobes for a flamenco show and Julia Tours is just a few blocks away if you want to book a tour. The hotel has all of the info you would need for this.

<Content>Wonderful hotel ! I stayed at the Continental with two friends in the first week of September prior to boarding our cruise ship. We shared the large suite right next to the front desk, so our door opened into the beautiful Grand Salon where breakfast is eaten. Everything in our room was gilded - the doors, the windows, the walls, the fireplace....just incredible, and so beautiful. The ceilings were 18 feet high.....it was like sleeping at Versailles (in fact it's called the Versailles suite and there are pix of it on the hotel website). The 24-hour buffet was not as elaborate as advertized, but the free wine and beer certainly kept us in party mood. The hotel is central for strolling comfortably to excellent restaurants (Mussol and Tonorio are two I highly recommend), and Las Ramblas is only a couple of blocks south. We enjoyed the balconies in the Grand Salon, opening up the doors and sitting in chairs in the cool breeze with our wine at 2 am. We felt very safe and very comfy. This is one of those quirky don't-miss-it hotels you read about in guide books.

<Content>The Palacete rules! A friend and I stayed at the Palacete for five nights at the end of September. We liked the hotel a lot. It has a great location at the top of Las Ramblas, but we had an interior room, so it was very quiet. It was also within easy walking distance of the Block of Discord (with the 2 Gaudi buildings). Our twin-bedded room was tiny, but adequate to our needs, and there was one English-language station (CNN) on the tiny TV (useful for keeping up with the news). Our room had a small closet for hanging clothes and a small fridge (strangely located in the closet, but...whatever). We also had plastic bedside tables that doubled as little chests of drawers. The decor was sort of in-your-face floral. Spotlessly clean. The only drawback to the room was that while we had a little deck off our room in the interior courtyard, there was a dead bird on the chicken-wire-type canopy above it; we just kept the door shut (and the AC on) the whole time, so it wasn't an issue. The bathroom was HUGE, by European standards; you could've practically held a square dance in it! The 24-hour buffet is really just snacky-type food, but the free soft drinks, water and beer are a real plus, as is the beautiful salon/common room with windows overlooking the Rambla Catalunya. There is also free wine on tap, but...it wasn't to my taste--VERY sweet! There are two public computers for guest use, one on the check-in desk (stand up to use it), and one near the salon (with the tiniest keyboard i've ever seen, but this terminal had a chair). We found the staff to be polite and helpful. I would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Great Location We stayed at the Palacete for two nights in Sept. 05. The location was great (2 blocks north of Placa Catalyuna), very convenient to Las Ramblas and also to catch the airport bus as well as subways and city busses.We enjoyed the 24 hour refreshments and the lovely 'salon' to eat them in. Our room was small (we had chosen this size of room so it did not come as a surprise, but we did find ourselves tripping over each other and our luggage.) If staying longer than 2 days, I would recommend a larger room. It was quiet as it faced the interior courtyard, so very nice for sleeping. The bed was short (I don't think it was even 6' long as my husband's feet hung over the end, although it was a good width, but a hard bed.) Some of the furnishings are a little different than we are used to (eg. the plastic storage 'dressers' for clothing), but otherwise, the room was nicely decorated. The staff were friendly and a few spoke English well.Based on the amount that we paid, I think it was a good choice

<Content>I wouldn't recommend this hotel While the hotel is in a great location, some of the staff were very rude and unhelpful. We needed assistance on a couple of occasions and the girl at the desk was annoyed that I was taking her away from a phone conversation with one of her friends. While the price is right and the breakfast and 24hr. food service was convenient, the beds were hard and the rooms pretty small.

<Content>Wonderful Small Hotel, Great Value The Continental Palacete is a lovely, small hotel with a lot to offer. The location is excellent being near everything but just beyond the noisiest parts of the Rambla. We booked a bigger room which was lovely. The bathroom was well appointed with hair dryer and the required amenities. We had a bumped out sitting area where you could view the activity below, but it was never noisy. The A/C worked well. The staff was unobtrusive but very willing to please. There is a 24 hour service bar where you can always get something to eat like a sandwich, cereal, fruit, salad, rolls, cookies and pastries, cheese, etc. and assorted beverages including juice, milk, wine, beer, bottled water,and even espresso. The unbelievable part is that you pay nothing extra for this lovely perk that comes with your room! The elegant sitting room has terraces where you can eat, sip, gab, or just enjoy the view! There is also a computer in the hallway that can be used to send a message home, free of charge (the cruise ship we had been on prior to our stay charged $.75 a minute!). Add that to the fact that the room prices are very reasonable and you have one little gem of a hotel! I would love to return to Barcelona and wouldn't want to stay anywhere else!

<Content>Great choice! Our family of 8 people stayed 3 nights and loved the friendly, homey, feeling of the hotel. The staff is most accommodating, the location is excellent, the rooms are clean and remind you of Old World design. Having an open buffet round the clock added much to our comfort. We would recommend staying at the Continental Palacete to anyone wanting a small, intimate, well run hotel.

Our friend from Zurich and two of my business associates from the UK also stayed here. After my meetings, I also did some sightseeing, and we all had some great food. The larger rooms are quite nice in the European manner -- not huge like US chains, but well appointed and very pleasant. We had two different larger rooms -- one for two nights, one for six, and a much smaller standard interior room for one night. The standard rooms are small (like those in the Westpark in NYC), but still nicely done -- a bit like the old vaudeille gag -- I didn't have room to change my mind! But that's only part of the story. What makes the smaller rooms quite viable is the very large and pleasant common area and sitting room, with a dozen or so tables and very large windows looking out onto the street below (this room, and the hotel desk are on a very high second floor. The hotel is also computer-friendly. There are two computers in the common area for occasional browsing use, and my laptop found a free WiFi connection to the internet, both in the common area and in both of our larger rooms. Didn't try it in the small room. Others have mentioned the 24-hour buffet as a nice plus, and it is. My wife and our Zurich friend especially liked it. There's even beer and wine, and it was nice to be able to offer it to friends who met us in the common area before going out to dinner together. It was almost like greating your friends in your living room! The coffee is a weak point -- if you like it strong, you'll be disappointed -- but there's a great coffee shop and bakery about five blocks up the main street. The location is very good, especially if you want to get around on Barcelona's excellent bus or subway systems. My business meetings were in the new CCIB, which is on the oceanfront in a rather out of the way part of town, but there is a direct bus route only a block away that got me there in 20 minutes. There are also direct bus routes to virtually all of the tourist destinations and restaurants. There are stations for several major subway lines within about three blocks. Important hint: go to the transit office in the nearby Universitat subway station (a few blocks southwest) and pick up the EXCELLENT bus map. Map makers around the world should be studying this map -- it's the best I've seen, both for the busses and as a map of the city. And it's FREE! Also, go for the 10-ride ticket, a real bargain. It's good on the fine subway system too, and you can transfer, but it's far nicer to see the city on the busses. For this reason, we rode the subway only once. The only downside of the bus system is that the last run of the night is often before you've finished dinner (restaurants don't open for dinner until 9 pm), so you may be in a cab for the ride back to the hotel. Oh yeah -- the bus back to the airport stops only two blocks away, making it very easy to get out of town (but with a separate fare, roughly 5 Euro, as I recall). Barcelona is a great city -- can you tell we loved it? Great energy, friendly people, lots to see and do.

<Content>Great Stay! Great Location! My friend and I stayed at the palacete during our trip to Barcelona, and it was the best decision we made! The hotel was beautifully decorated, had helpful and courteous staff, and was mins away from Las Ramblas. The hotel offers 24 hour internet access and continental buffet in case you want to take a break and grab a snack before going back out sightseeing. The rooms were nicely decorated (if you like pink and floral), clean, good water pressure, and you can adjust the heating in your room to your comfort level. The location of the hotel was great. We had a 2 min walk to Placa Catalunya. It put us at the beginning of Las Ramblas, mins away from the sightseeing bus tours, and near the metro stations. Also the hotel was situated in L鈥橢ixample where you can find great shopping and restaurants. At all times we felt safe and comfortable and I would recommend that everyone stay at the Continental Palacete if you want to enjoy your trip to Barcelona.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Great Location My family and I stayed in the Continental Palacete hotel for 4 nights in April 2005. We reserved two standard rooms, one for my husband and myself, and the other for our two boys (ages 15 and 25). We chose this particular hotel based on : a) an acquaintance who had just returned from a visit and highly recommended it and b) looking up the reviews on this site. We were NOT disappointed. I agree with just about everything that was said by previous reviewers, and would like to include the following :1) the 24 hr. buffet was fantastic. When you travel with two boys of these ages, they are always hungry. From previous experience, this meant always having food with me available for them, or always looking for something to eat, aside from meal times. This was the perfect solution. The food is by no means gourmet and it is EXACTLY the same ALL the time, but if you are not a foodie and are not looking to visit a city for its food and just need to have a bite when you are hungry, it absolutely fit the bill. The fresh fruit (pineapple!!!, bananas, oranges and apples) were marvelous. We missed having vegetables, as there were only tomatoes available. But the wide array of breads, pastries, drinks, cereals, etc. were more than adequate and the opportunity of taking several bottles of water with us on our journey in the morning was a great idea.2) The rooms are EXTREMELY small, so small that even for European standards I believe it is small. However, if you use the room only for sleeping, who cares? It was immaculate and that was more important for us. The beds are indeed extremely high (??) and mattresses are very very hard. It is still a toss-up whether they were good or not, I think everyone needs to discover it on their own. My boys and husband thought they were great, I was not sure. 3) Service was efficient, with a smile, readily available and very alert. One evening I noticed that a lamp in our bathroom was burned out and decided to wait till morning to mention it to the clerk at the desk. I forgot, but when we returned to our room that evening, it had been caught and exchanged without my telling them. Another time, we came back to the room to find several coins (money) sitting on the dresser. Apparently they had fallen out of someone's pants pocket and the maid must have picked them up and put them there. These two events, minor as they seem, say a lot, in my opinion, about the hotel and its management.4) Location was terrific, for us. It is close enough to the middle of the city to afford us walking distance to most of the place we wanted to see, but far away enough so as not to be noisy, crowded and dangerous.5) The free internet access (two terminals for guests to use) was invaluable, again with my children, and even for us. The only problem was that they were situated in such a way that you had to stand to use them. I guess they don't want people using them for hours at a time, but a different location with opportunity to sit and be comfortable would have been better.6) Finally, the beautiful lounge across from the kitchen/buffet was a wonderful place to have a meal or a drink. There are two additional smaller lounges on either side of this middle lounge. However, they were closed and locked for 3 of the 4 nights that we were there. I later ascertained that there are rooms next to these two smaller lounges and when guests need/want a suite, they add these two smaller lounges to those two rooms and then they are not available for regular guests. This is unfortunate since these smaller lounges have much more comfortable chairs, sofas, etc (as opposed to just plastic chairs) and they are more private.In conclusion, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel highly to anyone and return to it if ever again in Barcelona.

<Content>Lovely and convenient! Three of us stayed at this hotel in April. We were in a Sol Tribune room which was somewhat crowded for three (we put the rollaway cot in the bay window) but the room was prettily decorated and the bathroom good sized and immaculate. The public areas of the hotel are just beautiful and the convenience of the 24 hour snack bar was terrific. Also, the coffee is quite good. As we were in Barcelona on St. George's Day, we were all given red roses by the hotel in accordance with local custom. The staff were very friendly and gave us good recommendations for restaurants. The location of this hotel is excellent - just a block from the top of the Ramblas (and personally, I wouldnt want to be any closer), and walkable to all the wonderful Gaudi architecture. This hotel is extremely well located and an excellent value and I recommend it highly.

<Content>very good We stayed at the Hotel Continental Palacete on March 4  5, 2005.The location is ideal and very close to the Ramblas but in the better section of town just north of the Ramblas, and we felt absolutely safe there day or night. The Block of Discord was just around the corner and Casa Mila only 10 minutes walk away. The standard room we had was curiously shaped, squeezed in behind the reception desk and one of the public rooms, and and looked out on the street. There was no airconditioning, probably because the locals think that March is winter and aircon is not needed. Opening windows was not an option because of street noise. The hotel was beautiful and since I love old buildings I was delighted with the ambiance and decor. The little elevator is nice because I have artificial knees and could not manage the grand staircase although I admired it very much.The all day and night buffet was wonderful, and we made good use of it. The practise in Spain of late dinners was different for us, but we comfortably went sightseeing and had something at the buffet before freshening up and going out to dinner.If we go to Barcelona again I would stay here absolutely, but I would ask for one of their standard rooms in the back which do not have the street noise and have private small courtyards, and are the same price. The location and wonderful decor of this hotel make it a very good choice.

<Content>Beautiful, friendly hotel - we'll be back! What a great hotel. The rooms are small, but well appointed. The hotel itself is a beautiful building that has been lovingly restored. The staff is helpful and friendly, and the 24-hour breakfast buffet is a real bonus. You can get bottled water, soft drinks, even beer or wine any time - free. There are always snacks to munch on while you have your drink as well.The hotel is conveniently located just a short walk from Placa Catalunya, and a staff member directed us to a wonderful local restaurant nearby.We will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Little Hotel Loved it! I originally read great reviews on a cruise line forum and confirmed the reviews here on Trip Advisor. Boy were they right.We stayed a few nights in August and spent the extra $$ for one of the Sol Tribune rooms. It has a bump out that gave us a small sitting area and increased the size of the room. The rooms are small by American standards, but in line with European hotels. The shower was a little weird in that the head was on the side wall, so it was a challenge keeping the water off the bathroom floor. They provide liquid soap (which I detest) so we bought a couple of bars.An earlier poster said they hated the beds. We loved them. I think they are those new style somethingpedic ones. it was a little strange, but after about 5 minutes we were in love with it. I guess everyone is different.They also have 2 free internet access terminals that you can jump on anytme you want. Very handy for checking your e-mails.There is a great Tapas bar one block south (toward the Placa Catalunya). Everything else you see in the other reviews is right on so I won't bore you. But, I will say that you will underestimate the value of the 24 hour buffet. It really is invaluable.
