<Content>Hilton Caribe Stayed at hotel over the New Year with my wife and son. Could not fault the service and cleanliness of rooms. We found that the food and drink was expensive in the hotel but if you walked into Old San Juan about 40 minutes, there was plenty of places to eat and drink. New Years eve party was great, paid a 100 dollars each and you could drink as much as you want in about 12 bars, nearly all with different types of music playing. The hotel is set in a great location right on the beach no problem getting chairs. Would definately stay there again maybe next New Year.

<Content>A wonderful family get-together Our family spent a week at the Caribe Hilton to celebrate an anniversary; we brought our three children and spouses and their three young children. It was a great experience -- the hotel has a wonderful setting, right on the edge of Old San Juan, with its own sheltered beach (perfect for young children digging in the sand). There are also LOTS of pools and space to sit in the shade of palm trees near the water. The staff was extremely helpful, spending a long time with us at the front desk and giving advice about restaurants and current traffic conditions. I asked for sand buckets several times, and was loaned a large selection at no charge. We never dealt with a single person who was not cheerful and outgoing and friendly. Our rooms were large and well-supplied; having refrigerators made it easy for the young families to keep milk and cereal, etc. on hand for the kids. And children under 5 eat for free in the restaurants! One of the best parts of this hotel is its location near Old San Juan. There is a bus that goes directly into downtown, or plenty of taxis, and a lot to see and do. We also visited art museums in a different section of town. So you get the best of both worlds -- a relaxing beach resort hotel and a city with variety and history to visit nearby. It's a good place for a group like ours.

<Content>Solid Place, not amazing, not awful Checked in to Caribe Hilton 12/28/08, left 1/2/09.All in all, there wasn't anything worthy of major complaints, and there wasn't anything worthy of major praise.Plusses: - Beach and pool areas were nice, and though crowded, we were able to carve out an area for the two of us every day we sought to.- Staff was generally friendly, particularly the guys running the comp breakfast (for HHonors Gold  Platinum VIPs only) at the main restaurant.- Our room, located in the main building (not the tower) with a small balcony and ocean view, was clean and comfortable if slightly dated.- Concierge desk was helpful for local restaurants and getting around.- The comp breakfast at that restaurant (noted above), which normally goes for $18 pp, was solid and a good way to start the day. Not an amazing spread, but adequate and really satisfying if you're getting it for free.- The on-site Hertz makes renting cars easy, and we only paid $78 (all in) per day during a peak time. We were also able to return at the airport at no charge, saving a $25 cab ride.- The dollar is still all-mighty in PR (translation: you don't have to exchange money or worry about rates).Minuses:- Property is not central to anything. It's not far from the airport or Old San Juan, but it's certainly not walkable to anything particularly worthwhile (I know because I ventured out by foot my first day, wandering into a pretty shady neighborhood where I was warned by a fellow gringo to not be walking there, and this was at 3 in the afternoon).- There are two small shops just off the property, both offering a limited selection of basic supplies (beer, liquor, sodas, chips, etc.) at inflated prices. Still a better deal than the hotel, but it would be nice if there were more selections nearby.- As far as we could tell, there are no restaurant or bar options near the property, which was unfortunate when coming back at night hoping for a late bite or nightcap.- Everything at the property is, as other reviewers say, over-priced. This is a direct result of the notes above about nothing else being nearby. Light sandwiches, drinks at the bar, internet time, massages at the spa-- all cost more than they should have, probably contributing to ill-will among some guests. So much for being hospitable or travel taking you places (or maybe travel should take you into debt?).- The hallway leading to our room on the 5th floor was absurdly cold, to the point we would jog between the room and the elevator.- The actual swimming pools aren't that large, so don't expect to get your laps in or anything.- The hotel hosts a few separate New Years Eve bashes, which turned the place into a bit of a zoo. It didn't really affect us, although we could hear one party thumping well into the morning, but I suspect it ruined the night of some guests.- While the concierge desk was helpful, on the first night (12/28) we were told by both the concierge and the bellman that taxis to Old San Juan would be charging double the normal rate (from like $12.50 to $25) because traffic was so bad. This didn't happen any other night, and when we mentioned this to another, apparently higher-ranking member of the staff a few nights later on New Year's Eve, he gave a puzzled look and said that couldn't be the case and that the taxi drivers must have been up to something. When we told him the concierge and the bellman both told us this before getting a taxi, he seemed to be more concerned and confused by why this happened. So I think there could have been something shady going on there, and the staff might have been a part of it, which is very disturbing if true.General Comments:- In Puerto Rico, like most other places where tourists flock, there will be shadiness among the locals to make money off the tourists. So just be wise to what seems weird (like, say, taxis charging double on a random Sunday night).- Depending on what you're vacationing for, it's either a pro or a con, but the hotel was packed with families and kids. Happily, I didn't witness much misbehavior among the kids, but if you're not into hearing or seeing kids, this isn't the place for you (at least not at a peak time).- Yes, everything at the hotel is over-priced, just like at every hotel I've ever stayed at. But if your goal on a vacation is to never leave the hotel, while I can't relate, perhaps you should look into all-inclusive options elsewhere.- As noted, the Hertz on premises (in addition to the PayLess Rental Car directly across the street) make day trips to El Yunque, Luquillo and Fajardo (or all three, which we did in a day), extremely accessible. For the $120 you might spend in a day at the hotel pool on sandwiches, drinks and activities for the family, you can rent a car, see/hike the rainforest, sit on a much less crowded beach and eat cheap local food (or stop by a real grocery store and pack a picnic lunch, as I was advised to do by one of the concierges). Something to think about.- Full disclosure, I used HHonors points for the stay, so it made high-end dinners in Old San Juan and taxi rides less of an issue in terms of overall cost of the vacation.

<Content>Caribe Hilton good location/value for couples  My wife  I stayed at the Caribe Hilton for 2 days  1 night prior to taking a cruise. The Hotel is very clean, the staff very helpful  friendly. If you're a Hilton Honors Member (whether using points or paying for the room) the hotel will put you in a separate tower for Honors Members only (from what were told the rooms were larger and more updated than the ones in the main building). The hotel had the specifications as noted on the reservation (ie: upper floor, etc.) and had a room available for us for early check-in at 10AM, as well as, honored the request for a late check out at 2:00PM. The rooms have a refrigerator in them  the bathrooms have a separate shower  two person bathtub.The beach is very nice at the hotel, there are several chairs, tables, etc. on the beach  and at the pools next to the beach. The swimming area is clean and separated by a coral reef, with a trampoline  rock climbing float in it, but the undertow/tidal pull around the sun deck is strong  could be dangerous for children and/or weak swimmers, even though the water depth is around 3-6 feet (1-2 meters). Additionally, there are several hammocks on the grounds that shaded. There are a few bars and restaurants by the pool (including a swim up bar)  on the grounds too (including a Morton's Steakhouse) that are better than the average one at hotel.Overall, the hotel is very nice, worth the price or points, location is ideal, and worth staying at  visiting again.

<Content>Good place to stay in San Juan The Hilton is on a very large and pretty property not far from the airport. We stayed there Dec. 29-Jan 1 and it was a very busy t ime at the hotel. First, the beach was small, but usually if you looked you could find two recliners to lay on without having to walk up and down the length of it. The service at the beach was the usual food service- My burger was $15 but it came out quickly. The inflatable rafts are a bit steep, but they do have a huge inflatable trampoline out in the water that is free for everyone to use. The beach is in a small lagoon type setting, and the waves aren't anything like you would see on the U.S. Atlantic Coast, but there are waves and the water is very warm even in December. For the proximity to the hotel, you can't beat it. Always keep your room key on you, as they ask you to show it occasionally to enter the pool/beach walkway as you leave the hotel.Other than that the maids were very nice, and most everyone spoke English more than adequately. We rented a car the first day and drove it to the hotel from the airport- there is a garage next to the hotel that is easy to park in and seemed to always have spaces. It at least saves teh cab fare from the airport to the Hilton, and if you go with Hertz you can just return it at the hotel, since they have a desk there (without having to take it back to the airport). It was a very convenient option we took advantage of. Make sure you pay an extra $10 or $15 to get an ocean view room, it's not that much more and totally worth it. Don't eat at the hotel though for dinner- go into Old San Juan and experience PR for what it is. The cab fare is around $13-15 before tip. The restaurants in the HIlton are pricey!

<Content>This Place was Paradise! A group of 10 of us travelled to San Juan to celebrate my parents' 50th anniversary. While we went to San Juan primarily because this was the departure sight for our cruise, we went a few days eraly and stayed at the Caribe Hilton. If this facility was not paradise, I'm not sure what paradise would be. While the rooms may need some updating (nothing major), the grounds; the setting; and the amenities more than made up for this. You have a sprawling pool on one side and the beach about 50 yards away on the other side. When you arrive at the hotel, the lobby is open air and the check in desk is about 15 feet away from where you get out of your mode of transportation. There are beautiful parrots in a large cage in the lobby as well as refreshing stations of grapefruit flavored, pineapple flavored,  lemon flavored ice water water with fresh fruit. As soon as you arrive, you can't help but feel that this was a good choice. The breakfast buffet was a little pricey, but offered anything / evrything you'd want, including omelette station (somewhat slow), papaya, mango, pancakes....you name it. While there were 10 of us (6 adults; 4 children / teens), everybody had a ball. If we arte able to someday return to San Juan, I would not even bother looking into other hotels. While I am sure there are other nice facilities in the area, it would be hard to believe that any other hotel would match up with the Caribe. We would definately return! Hope this helps you decide.

<Content>1950 was a good year for the hotel.... We stayed at the HIlton Caribe over Christmas/Hanukkah 2008. Almost every person that we spoke to prior to our trip had told us that they had stayed at the hotel 20-30 years ago and loved it. We were eager to experience a great time.No doubt the hotel was first rate in the 1950's and 1960's--but nostalgia can only go so far. In many ways, the hotel reminded us of the glory days of the Catskill resorts in New York (The Concord and Grossingers).For a resort, the service was inconsistent at best and surly at worst. The food was very expensive (but not unlike other overpriced resorts.) The special lounge for VIP/HIlton Honors guests featured an evening cocktail hour (cash bar) and free snacks consisting of just cookies. They could have given more, don't you think?The inflatable iceberg in the water broke on day two of our trip and did not re-appear. The lox ran out each morning on the breakfast buffet. The free daily newspaper was a photocopy of the online NY Times and even that ran out. (couldn't they just make more copies?). Inflatable rafts and water toys were available for rent at $20 for a day--not even close to reasonable.One concierge insisted that our GPS from New York would not work in Puerto Rico (it did). The movie shown nightly broke one evening and popcorn was only served at the early movie. It was a nice touch that was missing at the later show (9:00 PM)To be fair, the hotel is not all bad. The hotel is well located to the center of town and the housekeeping staff were very nice. To regain first clas status, the hote needs some updating and staff training. While some of the staff understand guest relations, most did not, and when a hotel is tired and worn the staff can make it better by being customer focused.

<Author>HeavenCh
<Content>Not worth the money I am writing a long review, so if you are busy, here's the bottom line: there are better deals than this hotel.When I made a reservation in a world famous Hilton resort hotel chain, paying a certain amount of money, there was a certain expectation, but this hotel didn't meet my expectation.First Impression:My first impression of this hotel was that it was old and crowded. I saw wear and tear, here and there, although our room in the tower seemed new.Location:The location was good for old San Juan and Ashford Avenue, and about one hour or more one-way driving to the biobay, scuba diving, ferries for Vieques, or El Yunque, which is ok.However, it was not easy to find a market or a restaurant nearby.Room and Tower:Our tower room was nice and new.Our bed throw had black spots here and there, which I strongly suspected as mold, so we never used the throw. Other bedding stuffs were good and comfortable.The bathroom didn't have a bathtub and ventilation, which was a minus, but had a nice shower system with good hot water pressure.No minibar, which translated to a free empty refrigerator.The tower didn't have any security, so anyone from the street could go in and out freely. Also it was a little bit away from the private beach or the swimming pool.Beach and Swimming area:The swimming pool was OK but didn't look as good as other resort hotels' pools I visited including other Hiltons although it didn't matter for me because I spent time not in the pool but on the beach.The private beach was good and safe for children as it was protected by a breakwater or something. There were some floating things to climb up and enjoy, and a sunbathing balcony on the sea. Although it was crowded, we had a good time on the beach.Food:Everything is overpriced. One bottle of Bud Light will cost you $8+tax+tips. A McDonald quality hamburger was $13+tax+tips at a bar, and it was the cheapest snack you can get in the hotel except Starbucks, which was the only place with reasonable prices in this hotel.If the food quality was good, we wouldn't complain about the price because we were on vacation and ready to spend some. However, we didn't want to pay that money for this quality of food, so we always drove out to eat and to shop for the next day's breakfast.BTW, this hotel claims that its pool bar is the birth place of the pina colada. If you want to try it, it is $13+tax+tips.Staff:Most of the staff was friendly and nice except for the front desk manager. The concierge was so helpful, and even house keepers were always smiling although they were not good at English. However, when I was in trouble, the front desk manager was very unhelpful and gave me a why-should-I-be-bothered-about-your-fault attitude. How she neglected me really astounded me. Fee, Parking, Internet, ETC:You need to pay the additional resort fee (about 13 or 14%) even if you already paid for your room.Everything costs you money. I already wrote about the overpriced food. Parking also costs like $15 a day, and the parking garage was not connected to the hotel facilities which was very bad while raining. Internet was also like $15 a day. Although they said the wireless Internet on the lobby was free, we couldn't get the signal at the lobby and ended up paying the money to get the wired access.Overall, I am willing to re-visit Puerto Rico, especially to do the biobay tour again, but I would not stay at this hotel next time.

<Content>Overpriced and dated We stayed here one night pre-cruise. I thought it would be worth booking this hotel for the beach, and it was. What was disappointing was the room. Very dated. Wood panelling on the walls gave it a 70's appearance. We booked a deluxe oceanview concierge room. The oceanview was great, but I did not see any advantage to having concierge service. The room was VERY small... leading me to wonder what the room would have been like if it were not a deluxe! On a positive note, location was good, beach was good, lobby is great.Everything at the hotel is RIDICULOUSLY expensive. We regularly stay at high end resorts, but we do not like to feel ripped off at every turn. There is a difference between paying for quality, and paying for a name and I felt at this resort that was what we were doing.

<Content>Stupidly Expensive As HHonors Diamond, I've spent plenty of time in hotels over the years. Overall the lobby and the room were clean and updated, but the hallway to the room was badly in need of a fresh paint job. The steel door frames were already showing rust holes. The big suprise was that they seem to think if you were on vacation there would be no limit on what you would be willing to spend on everything - parking $16/day, beer $9, burger $10, entrees at least $25 + 10 for a side, internet free in lobby, $16/day in your room - lucky for me the Condono Plaza across the bay takes care of their guests with free wireless and I was able to get it from my room. It seems greedy to me, it became my goal to take every penny offsite, luckily their parking attendant is so consumed was her personal life that she didn't make me sign the book, which resulted in me only paying for 2 of 8 days I parked there. We had a rental car so we went and ate at local places for a normal price. IF prices had been resonable we would have eaten several meals on site just for convienence. We talked to several other guests who had the same complaint.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Grounds, Great Location While down here in Puerto Rico, we scoped out all of the other hotels that were on our list. The Caribe Hilton has a great beach, and there is a breakwater out a ways from the hotel that keeps the water nice and calm. The resort is probably the largest in San Juan and there are huge pools and tons of places to spread out. You won't feel hemmed in here. The grounds were beautiful and the various locations where you could sit down were perfect. Request a room in the Hilton Honors tower, which is the newest renovated part of the resort. The room was very clean and the bed was super comfortable. We didn't have much a view, but I really didn't spend a whole lot of time in the room other than to sleep and shower. The bathroom was really big and had a great shower. The food in the pool bar was nothing to write home about, but there were plenty of options like Starbucks and a Subway if you just wanted a sandwich during the day. The hotel was maybe 10 minutes from Old San Juan which compared to the 30 minutes from the Ritz or Intercontinental was really nice. Everyone at the hotel was super friendly and nice and the service was excellent. The concierges worked very hard to get us into great restaurants and the staff around the pool was very polite and friendly. As far as nightlife goes, the hotel doesn't get that busy at night although on the Thursday we were here, they were having a huge party and tons of young people were here.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and I would without a doubt come back here again.

<Content>Wonderful Stay I was very concerned about staying at Hilton Caribe after reading many of the posting on this site. Because of this our expectations were so low. We were there from Dec 19 - 24th and we had a wonderful time. The resort facilities were clean. The service was crisp and friendly. The staff we encountered was courteous and professional. The only glitch we had was with our initial room which was a handicapped equipped one with shower. I went back to the main desk and politely asked if we could be moved. We were immediately moved to an ocean front room in the Hilton Towers on the 13th floor with amazing views. The private beach was great and with plenty of chairs and umbrellas and towel services. The pools were very nice. The exercise room we used every day and was one of the better equipped hotel ones I have used. In terms of pricing, it is true the resort is pricey. Internet is $15 if you want it in your room, but free in the lobby. We also stayed away from the restaurants and bar by having breakfast at the Subway (which was much better than the ones in the US. The omeletes were made fresh in front of you.). We ordered carry out Cuban sandwiches and Medallia beers at the local liquor store. The Cuban sandwiches were amazingly good. The liquor store is right across the street and perhaps looks a little seedy on the outside, but it is a family run business. We saw many locals and police eating there. There were the best Cuban sandwiches we ever had. The beer was $1.50 a can and we stocked them in our refrigerator in our room. And, for dinner, we took the bus to Old San Juan. The bus stop is about 3 blocks away and costs 50 cent. We never waited more than 5 minutes for a bus. We took it both ways. We have lived in Chicago and this bus was clean and the people riding it were working class people, students, and locals. It was great. Old San Juan was a delight. We thought the location was terrific for us and my wife said she wanted to stay there again next year.

<Content>Pretty Good... appeared to be getting better Decent Hilton, appears to be family friendly. Definitely a good hotel to use as a stopover between cruising or heading to other islands in the carib. Towers were being built at the time so, the general condition and quality of the hotel appear to be improving. We stayed in the Hilton VIP tower and the accomodations were very nice with stone bathroom/shower, great views, comfortable bed, always clean, etc. We would definitely stay there again but would not spend an entire vacation/week at this property. It is best used 'in transit' to your next location or would be an excellent option for a quick/long-weekend getaway since you are so close to Old San Juan and can explore the area.

<Content>Good hotel with lots going on Have stayed at Caribe Hilton numerous times. Good location and lots of things going on. Has a great pool and beach scene. Good service. Nice room amenities.Drinks are very expensive....had two Medella Light beers for $17.50. But it is a fun place so you spend the money and think about it later!Ate at the Spanish Tapas Restaurant. Service was good. Food was ok but prices were very expensive for what you got. Caribe Hilton is a nice hotel if you want options for beach, pool, restaurants, shopping and a spa. If you want something small and quiet, you should look elsewhere.

<Content>Nice notel, but overcrowded Got an excellent price 135$/night. Check-in was pleasant, room was in the lagoon villa - spacious, clean, nice and overlooking the waters but personally would have preferred the ocean-view and the lagoon-view. Caribe Hilton is a big hotel, so the lobby was always crowded. The pools are beautiful and large. The Walk along the ocean-front was great, but the beach has been altered to break the waves, so the waters was not exactly clear. I guess the purpose of the beach is to make it safe for kids and families but it ruins the real ocean-feel. Restaurants are overpriced - from b/f buffet to specialty restaurants. My advise - rent a car and drive to Condado/old San Juan to eat out. There are tons of choices out there. Another piece of advise - avoid the hotel tours, do it yourself. They are way overpriced. Overall, enjoyed the stay, but would prefer to stay @ Wyndham Rio Mar (we split our stay across hotels while we moved aroud).

<Content>OK but pricy My wife and I stayed here on 11/14, the night before our cruise and on 11/22 and 11/23, following our cruise.  We arrived around 11am and check-in went very smoothly. Desk personnel were very pleasant. We used our Hilton Honor points for the first night so the price was right. Our room was ready on the sixth floor and we found the room acceptably clean. I had read somewhere that the property had undergone a 90 or so million dollar renovation not that long ago. I don't think they spent it on the rooms. There was a nice view at least.  On our return stay, we again arrived around 11am. and proceeded directly to our room, this time on the ninth floor. This time was a bit pricier. We paid $274 a night plus about another $60 in taxes. Ditto on the room condition but the hallway had a rather unpleasant odor.  The food prices were a bit extreme with Morton's being the worst. The steaks were good, I'll concede that, but let's not even talk about the $10 baked potato. I don't care how big it is, a potato isn't worth 10 bucks. I found the $15 a glass wine at my local liquor store for $23 for the bottle.  We had a free buffet breakfast one morning which was mediocre at best. Our second morning was a choice of an overpriced buffet ( $25 a head ) or order from the overpriced menu ( $15 omelets and $4 orange juice. ) Before some one replies with a typical  Hey, you're on vacation, if you don't like it stay home., let me just say that I have no aversion to spending money. I just like to get something of value in return. On the brighter side, the pool and beach were very nice. The hotel staff was outgoing and helpful. Victor the bartender was exceptionally nice and makes a mean mango colada. The cab rides to and from Old San Juan varied from $12 to $14. I think it was about $25 from the airport, I don't remember exactly.  This being our first time in San Juan, we picked the Hilton based on reputation, not location. We're not party animals by any stretch but it seemed pretty dead around the hotel after dark. We could see a hotel / casino from our room but when we tried to walk there, we quickly ran out of sidewalk, light and pedestrian traffic and decided to turn back. To wrap things up, I'd have to say that we have stayed at Hilton Gardens and even Hampton Inns that have been every bit as nice as this Hilton. I doubt that we would return to this location.

<Content>Wouldn't stay here again.... Priceline chose this hotel for us, so I am glad that we got a good deal. I would have been really bummed out if I would have had to pay full price. The hotel is nice when you first pull up, but it's another story once you check in. The hallways smell really musty and the rooms are just ok for Hilton. I guess they did a $60 Million renovation 10 years ago, I think it needs another. The pools and beach were great, the prices at all the restuarants were ridiculous. The gym was awesome, the location of the hotel is NOT by any means convenient. You have to pay $12-$14 PER cab ride whether you are going to Old Town or across the bridge to Condado. That was a total rip off. The staff said not to cross the bridge at night (walking) so we paid $12 both ways just to go to the hotel that we could see from our room! The staff also said not to use the bus at night....next time I would stay in the Condado area for sure or Old Town. Sorry Hilton, didn't pass this time.

<Content>ENJOYED IT The Caribe Hilton is a gorgeous resort and we enjoyed our stay very much. The secluded beach is a plus. The forts are beautiful and the pina coladas are by far THE BEST I have ever tasted! We stayed in Room 1665 in the HH Tower, which is a fairly new building and the room was beautiful. My only complaint was the air conditioning made a loud crashing noise every time it turned on and off. It started on our last night there so we didnt bother. I was a little worried about not having any security in the tower since anybody from the street can literally walk in there. Not one person was ever sitting at the front desk, which was odd. At night, the hotel's halls were empty and quiet. Very relaxing atmosphere but if you want to party, I'd strongly suggest El San Juan Resort just a few minutes away. The nightlife there is sizzling. A few tips for those traveling to San Juan and staying at this hotel: book your room on their website using the pre-pay method ... it comes out much cheaper that way. DO NOT eat at Mortons as it is extremely and ridiculously overpriced. Take the bus as it is free until next month and once they do start charging, it's only 50 cents. Taxi rides are expensive and can run you up to $21 for a 12-15 minute cab ride. Walk El Paseo del Morro ... you'll find a dead end at the end of the trail but it is worth it and very beautiful. Rent a car if you plan on going out of the San Juan area, it is much cheaper. There is a Subway around the corner from the hotel. We ate there for lunch almost everyday and they even serve breakfast ... about 70% cheaper than eating at one of the hotel's restaurants. We liked the Spanish restaurant called Madrid-San Juan and we also enjoyed Lemongrass which serves sushi and asian dishes. All in all, we had a lovely stay but would have prefered El San Juan for more nightlife. The location of the hotel is perfect. Be sure to visit the local park which is within walking distance and also try their pina coladas!!! It's their specialty :)

<Content>Avoid the Caribe Hilton The Caribe Hilton probably is the worst large hotel in San Juan: poor room clealiness and maintenance, unexisting service, excessive food and drink price, old style and dusty room furniture, absent security in the HH Tower.The only positive side is the nice and clean beach.First and last time in the Caribe Hilton. Happilly the choice is wide in San Juan.

<Content>Lots of pluses, a (very) few minuses This is the second time we stayed at the Caribe Hilton. The place is starting to show its age, but all in all, it's still worth it.We booked the room on Priceline, and when we arrived, got what I called the Priceline room --- overlooking an air conditioning system. That would have been okay. But the room (328) was a mess --- black scuff marks on the walls, mold in the bathtub tile and hair on the bathtub. I politely brought that to management's attention, and they quickly found another, extremely nice room. Hat's off to them for their effort.The Caribe Hilton has several nice pools, including a swim-up bar, a private beach, and decks that overlook the ocean. Beautiful. You can spend the day lounging around. Bar prices are typically ridiculous --- plan on $30, with tax and tip, for two alcoholic drinks, and $15 for a sandwich --- but we avoided that.One of the BIG cons is location. There's only one restaurant nearby, the over-rated Escambron, and I'd avoid it, even though it's just a 5-minute walk away. So you have to venture to Ashford Avenue or Old San Juan for an authentic meal. That means you either have to walk 30 minutes to a restaurant on Ashford or spend $12 to $15 each way for a cab. That makes eating out really pricey (during the day, you can take a bus to Ashford or Old San Juan, but I wouldn't recommend it at night).If you're not interested in authentic fare, the hotel has four restaurants, including a Morton's Steak House. Figure at least $125 for dnner two there, and at least $60 at the other restaurants (and that's without alcohol). Since I've been to San Juan many times I know how to get around and save a lot of money. If you're going to spend all of your time at the Hilton, it will cost you. But that's not any different from anywhere else in the area. The pools, best private beach in the area and outstanding service make it worth it.

<Content>Great service I stayed at the Caribe Hilton for a business trip. My drive in from the airport which is only 7 miles away was extremely stressful due to the unusually heavy traffic created by the upcoming elections and the fact that the all of the road signs were in Spanish. This caused me a terrible amount of stress (especially knowing that I had to drive to Ponce which is about an hour and a half away) the next morning. I tried on several occasions to use mapquest to no avail. When I went to the concierge desk the next morning, a very nice young lady named Sonia Alvarez gave me a piece of paper with directions to Ponce. She also made sure to give additional information as to which exit to get off at and landmarks to help me find the hopsital I was looking for. Thanks to Sonia, I found my destination without any problem and had an opportunity to enjoy the beautiful countryside of Puerto Rico.

<Content>Lovely! We had a great stay at the Caribe Hilton from Oct 18-24th. The lobby was gorgeous, the staff very friendly and helpful. I had read reviews and was a little nervous when we received a room in the Main tower, but we loved our room. We had a little balcony overlooking the private beach and cove. It was lovely. We also had Ms. Puerto Rico contestants staying on our floor. They were a little noisy in the hallways in the morning, but they got the message and were more courteous as the week went on. We loved the pool, activities, cab rides from the lobby and the folks in the bar (Victor especially) were great. The prices at the hotel were expensive for drinks, but it was so convenient. They gave great recommendations for restaurants in Old San Juan. Cab ride was $13 each way, but there was also a free bus across from the hotel. We also visited Isla Verde and were very glad to have our own private beach at the Caribe.Only drawback- beware of the menu prices at the pool- they say one thing, but charge you something else. When we inquired, we were told that the prices had changed and the menus were old.

<Content>Loved the Hilton Caribe My husband and I just got back from staying at the Hilton Caribe for 6 days. After reading the reviews before we left, as we always do, once again, the people's comments were ridiculous! The Hilton Caribe is a top-notch hotel and resort. We always were greeted with a smile and a hello from all the workers, as well as had great service the entire stay. The thing that threw us is that people complained about a missing tile here, or a spot of mildew there. The fact of the matter is the hotel is 100% open to the outdoors, and seeing as though it is surrounded by water, what do you expect? The grounds are immaculate and being worked on daily. The pools are really nice, as is the beach.We do a long vacation once a year, and chose the Caribe because we had Hilton Honor points we wanted to use....we travel. Yes it is pricey, but its vacation. If you want it to be inexpensive (meals, etc) stay home and cook, or better yet, go to Vegas and stay off the strip and try to find the covetted $9.99 buffet ! This is a tourist destination, people! The food was excellent, as well as the room. The beds are some of the most comfortable we've ever had, especially out of the states. All in all, the Hilton does it right at the Caribe. I highly recommend it. If you are going in trying to pick apart the place, you should go and stay in a penthouse in downtown New York or LA. Get over it!

<Content>Only One Big Problem... My Wife and I spent two nigths from October 10-12 at the Caribe Hilton making the reservation directly trough the reservations department at the hotel.The check-in was very easy,the facilities are way better than our last stay(May last year) but noting new at the Oasis Bar and now is more expensive.We live in Humacao Palmas del Mar Residences and we were having souch a great time like many other times before,but on saturday the 11th my wife was in the jacuzzi at the Lagoon Villas and she call me very scared saying that a man from security named Amador was asking her to leave the area because it was 11:00 pm and the area was close,so she have to follow the rules or leave the hotel,my wife as a good lawyer said that she understand the rules but the way he was aproaching her(rude and unrespecfull) was not the best one,the security agent  start calling people from his radio and my wife decide to leave the area,once I arrive to the hotel we went to the front desk to report the situation and to talk personaly with the security agent but nobody,nobody was able to help,I got a 27 years marriage and I won't let anybody disrespect my wife,so my answer about the hotel is that I wouldn't return....period.

<Content>Loved the Hotel We stayed at the Caribe Hilton on Sept 19th  20th for a quick 5 year getaway. I am a Hilton Honors member and try to stay at Hilton when I travel for work. It was a great stay, and we loved it. Ithamar and Norma got us rooms on the Executive Floor in the Main building, which were fantastic rooms. And Dominick R. (Hotel Ambassador) was one of the best. He had great recommendations, always friendly and helpful, and always greeted us. Very clean and a great view of the ocean. The concierge lounge was a nice touch. We loved out stay, ate lunch in the swim up bar and spent a lot of time in the pool. Very clean and quiet (when we were there). The hammocks were nice, feeding the fish was fun, and the restaurants were nice. There was a fashion show there Sat night, but we didn't have any problems with noise. We would definitely go back, and maybe even take the kids. We have no complaints about this hotel, it was a great place.

<Content>Amazing hotel  Our stay at the Caribe Hilton was absolutley wonderful. We stayed for a whole week and enjoyed our time tremendously. The hotel is blessed with one of the most spectacular locations in San Juan with its own private beach, a vast array of activites, great pools, we enjoyed the various restaurants, especially the romantic and very beautiful Lemongrass restaurant. The bar area with fantastic cocktails, the pool bar was a lot of fun. The setting is magical with two small forts to the left and right of the property and lush green surroundings, the palm trees and the magic of the Coqui with thier special song call. The room was divine with the breathtaking views of the Lagoon, beach and pool from the balcony. The service was top notch and very friendly from the housekeeping right through to the Concierge Eric, who was a source of information and perfomed miracullous feats in getting us into all the restaurants and organising everything we wanted to do. Our overall recommendation is this hotel with all its amenities and services is world class. We will return happily.

<Content>Hospitality generally assured... Stayed at the Caribe Hilton in late August this year, having stayed there 4 years ago, with positive memories. In general they didnt fail to satisfy, and earned a slightly above average score. LocationThe hotel is very nicely located in close proximity to Condado (touristy), and old San Juan (a must see), and 10 minutes from the airport and Plaza Las Americas (shopping). It has its own beach -not great at all by Caribbean standards. But a very nice pool area and relaxing hammocks under coconut trees. Rooms:True to my memory, the beds were more heavenly than other brands promote - certainly very comfortable. My room viewed the old fort and Condado shoreline. There were two spoilers to the view, however: (i) the hotel restaurant rooftop in the foreground; (ii) an intensely bright beam of light from across a close section of the condado public beach area, where apparently there may have been some music festivals. this not only prevented an enjoyable viewing experience, but also facilitated noise and affected privacy at nights forcing use of the drapes. The room i had was close to the elevators and therefore a little noisy the first evening especially. When i asked for a change i was very pleasantly advised that the hotel was currently full to capacity, however if i checked back the following day they could inform whether or not another room would be available. The better response would be for them to follow up with me the following day, but hey...its not a five star!RestaurantOnly had breakfast. It does make sense to book the breakfast buffet package. The offerings were wide, varied and delicious. Absolutely no complaints in that area.Valet/ParkingThis made no sense to me. I rented a car, but the hotel had no parking whatsoever on or apparently near property. Once you arrive you are ambushed by the valet service and charged a mountain for the dubious benefit of having them take your car to an undisclosed location (I did ask, and was told vaguely that it was at a location nearby. When i asked further, the valet agent suddenly had a difficulty speaking in English!) The difficulty i had was that it took an average of 15 minutes for my vehicle to be returned each time i visited the valet with my ticket. The frontdesk informed me pleasantly (yup, always pleasant) that the valet service was not affiliated with the hotel, but was unable to assist with options other than use of the valet.ServiceApart from valet service, generally very pleasant and willing to assist. Room service and restaurant scores high points.OverallBecause of the rooms, the location/environment and the service this hotel scores high points with me. It was easy to forget the valet service, once inside the hotel, however it certainly would cause me to reconsider staying there next time.

<Content>Great Hotel and Easy Transportation to Old San Juan My family and I just got back from a one week trip to San Juan. We booked a stay at this hotel and loved it. I'm not a beach lover so I wasn't sure if this would be the hotel for me. Fortunately, there's a little something for everyone here. There's a private beach for the hotel guests, a pool, a jacuzzi, a fitness center, and spa. My favorite thing to do was swing in the hammock at night, staring up at the palm trees against the evening sky with the sound of ocean waves crashing in the background. It was great. There are exotic birds in the lobby, swans and other birds in the garden, and tropical fish in the back. To get up close with the swans, just follow the signs to the garden. To see the fish, you just need to follow the green pier that stretches out into the water at the back of the hotel. Go in the evening. The giant fish swimming there will be a sight worth seeing. In terms of location, it was pretty easy to get to Old San Juan by bus. About a 5 minute walk to the bus stop and less than a 20 minute ride. Since this year is an election year, the city buses were all free. Otherwise, it would have cost around 75-cents per trip. Still better than the $15 cab ride (for five people) we paid on our first day! Also, if you're up for a walk in the heat, you can walk to the Condado Hotel  Casino that's across the bay. There's a little bridge that stretches over there. At one point, you may even bump into some kids jumping off the bridge and diving into the water. The bridge is pretty low so there's no danger with the height. Just watch out for the rocks if you choose to follow.For meals, the hotel restaurants are somewhat pricey. As an alternative, there is a Subway sandwhich shop located at the corner across the street. They also sell gelato in there. It's pretty good. Other restaurant choices are either in Old San Juan or in the Condado Beach area.

<Content>For events or family stays they are incredible We hosted an event where we had to accommodate over 100 people including artist. At the same time I took the opportunity to take my family as well. While I was there for business and pleasure the hotel were able to meet both business and family expectations.I thank specially Vanessa Moreno for her incredible attitude to serve our needs and Luis and Annette from the front desk for going out of his way for us when asked.

<Content>Loved it I'm surprised by the reviews of the Caribe Hilton. My husband and I and our two children(8 and 11) had a great experience. My husband travels for work and we stayed using Hilton Honors points (diamond club member, I think) so we had a room in the executive tower which is newer and very nice. We actually lived in PR for six months and this was our mini vacation before flying home. We had been all over the island and my husband and I had also stayed in the Ponce Hilton (south side of island). I admit that the service and overall appearance of the hotel is not as nice as some hiltons and even the Ponce Hilton, but it was still very nice. (don't expect the same quality of service in PR as in the states - they have a much more laid back approach to everything and you will wait for food everywhere you go - even fast food - just let go of your Western expectations, relax and follow the local motto -no worries) I also admit that the food is VERY expensive, even compared to other nice hotels on the island. (there are restuarants within walking distance, both cheap fast food and nice ones - you can also always take a cab as well). Having said that, I will tell you what I liked and why I would recommend it to anyone.1. It's within walking distance to one of the best beaches in San Juan - Escambron. It's very popular with locals, which gives you a taste of the local culture, and it is a great place for beginners to snorkel. It's one of the places we always took visitors. The peninsula of sorts is a great place to walk at night and there is a decent nice restuarant there with an outdoor patio overlooking the beach. make sure to try the Red Snapper (traditionally cooked whole, fins and all in a beautiful presentation - check out their sign which has a picture on it)2. It is also with in walking or short cab ride to Old San Juan, which is a must see and do.3. The scenery is very nice. The beach is in a cove and looks over toward escambron beach. There are ruins of the old wall of the city across the little bay. You also get a great view of the San Juan coast line, especially at night.4. The grounds are attractive and large enough to find a quiet place, most of the time. It is a great place to sit and look at the ocean.5. The pool is large and good for kids or adults wanting to lounge, with a bar in the adult pool.6.The beach is great for families - who cares that the sand is imported - at least it's clean. There is a raft with slides that our kids liked. Beginners can also snorkel here - try over by the rocks . One of the tourist groups that takes people to snorkel is often out in the bay just outside of the beach markers.7. It's off of the beaten path away from most of the other Hotels.FYI, I have also stayed at the Intercontinental and loved it very much. It is on the nicest white sand beach on the Island and in the heart of Hotel row near the airport. (Isla Verde) It may be a bit nicer, but the grounds and pool area are much smaller. They do have a great place to sit on the beach and have a casual dinner watching the sun go down. Take a cab there to spend an afternoon and stay and have dinner on the beach.We recommended the Caribe to a friend going to SAn Juan for work. She's traveled all over the world. She spent a week there (including a night at the Intercontential) and LOVED the Hotel Caribe. She sat outside until late at night never wanting to go inside. Annother of my husbands co-workers who travels extensively and is very picky about where he stays, has stayed in many of the upscale hotels in San Juan and always chooses to come back here when on the Island. He even chooses it over the Ponce Hilton and the Intercontinental .Hope this helps.

<Content>Very Pleasant Hilton Experience My husband, teen-age son and I spent three very pleasant days at the Caribe Hilton. The rooms were well-kept, on the small side but functional. The bathroom was large with a walk-in shower, no tub. The beach and ocen were delightful. The pool was on the dirty side but I think that was due to the aftermath of the Labor Day week-end crowd. The pool is weell designed however. There is a very nice tapas bar in the Tower building lobby that serves good Spanish wines by the glass at very reasonable prices. This is a good hotel to come to without a car. There is a bus (75cents) to Old San Juan and other attractions. There are always taxis lined up in the driveway. It costs about $10-15.00 each way into Old San Juan.We would stay here again.

<Content>I'm a Hilton Honors Member and will never stay here again I travel alot and I'm a HHonors Silver member and have stayed in tons of Hiltons as well as Hampton Inns, Embassy Suites etc. My 3 friends and I stayed the Caribe Hilton from August 29th to September 1st and I was disappointed by the quality of this Hilton. The first room I was given (we had booked two rooms for the 4 of us) smelled too musty and we refused to take it. It was in the HHonors tower. The front desk was kind enough to move us to a room on the 7th floor of the main building which as much nicer, odorless and had a great view. The breakfast buffet, which is a great spread, is a royal pain the neck as one has to wait sometimes over 35 minutes to get seated. It is very crowded and does not have the feel of a holiday resort. Our breakfast was included in our rate, but they ended up charging me for one day anyway..this was resolved at checkout.The beach is fake..no real beach here, they bring the sand in from somewhere. So you are better off hanging out by the pool, which is also very crowded.As we had also booked a Spa vacation, we had the pleasure of getting full body massages (which were super) as well as manicure/pedicure treatments. I have no complaints about the Spa only that they need a better system of tracking what is included with the Spa package. Rooms were clean enough but the hotel seemed to be skimping on wash cloths..we had to request these twice.Overall: We paid $229/person and this included breakfast + 3 spa treatments so it was well worth the money. But the smelly room, and crowded breakfast area means I will not return here. The first time I visited San Juan, we stayed at the San Juan Mariott and Stellaris Casino in Condado..now that was a beach resort, and perfectly clean and odorless hotel. That is where I will stay upon my return.

<Content>Outstanding customer service My experience wasn't personal, however it was even better since I was in the United States and through telephone conversations and emails with the hotel personnel, I was able to execute a surprise for a dear friend who was spending his vacation for the first time in Puerto Rico, specifically at the Caribe Hilton. Everybody from the Concierge to the Food  Beverage Supervisor and Manager was excellent at following through with what they said they will do. Not only that, they also made sure they covered every single detail to ensure the surprise was a success. I definitely can count on them and will highly recommend the Caribe Hilton Hotel to all my friends and family.

<Content>NOT Impressed with the Hilton Let me start first by saying for a Hilton I expected much better, I mean come for almost $500 per night I wouldn't think you would have holes in the floor!! We arrived in San Juan around 2:30 on a saturday so of course the airport was very crowded. We finally got a cab and he took us to our hotel. We waited forever to check in (and there really weren't alot of people in line) in the open air lobby, so by the time we were done we were hot and sweaty. We were upgraded to the Honors tower. We were very impressed to begin with the shops seemed nice and the honors tower lobby was beautiful, we took the elevator up to the 15 floor, and it ended there. As soon as we stepped off we saw dirty walls and stained carpet. We got to our room, and it was worse. The walls seems filthy and needed repainting in the worst way, the air didn't work well, and while the bathroom was very large, with nice tile floors and showers, there were holes in the floor under the sink. Not sure what they were doing in there but maybe they need to finish their renovations before renting rooms out to people. We had to turn the air down to 65 just to get it to run for more than 2 minutes at a time. We first set it on 70, when it was close to 80 already in the room, and it ran for 2 minutes ( we timed it) then went right back off. It finally cooled off when we went to bed around 10:00 that night. We finally decided that we only had to stay one night (at least it seemed clean, and the bed was comfy I will give them that) so we would go explore the grounds. First we walked over to where the fort was and watched about 50 crabs crawl around walked over around the pool, then finally over to the fish pond to see the swans and the peacocks. We enjoyed that, then went back to order room service and waited over an hour for a cheeseburger. I don't know if it was really good, or I was just really hungary, but since I hadn't eaten for 14 hours, (not even peanuts on the plane) it seemed to me like the best cheeseburger ever, my husband says otherwise; not bad but just ok. The view was ok, pretty to the left and right but straight in front of us was a very nice roof if looking past it you could see water. We only stayed one night, as we were leaving on a cruise the next day, and when we checked out we were stuck with over $100 over what we were quoted as our final price. We spoke with the Hilton before we left and were told what our total would be complete with taxes and hotel fees, and we were lied to, because our total bill was close to $100 more than that.To sum it up, it would be worth staying there if they didn't charge so much. But with the problems we had I wouldn't stay again. I guess you only pay for the name, not the actual quality of the hotel. I will be wiser next time. On the bright side we had excellent weather, the day after hurricane Faye!!

<Content>Think twice before booking at Caribe Hilton My husband and I stayed at the Caribe Hilton from 8/15/08 to 8/21/08 and we were very disappointed. I had called the hotel 5 days prior to arriving, just in case, to confirm our reservation and let them know we would be arriving late (11:00 pm) and to request one king size bed instead of two queen size beds. They confirmed us for a late arrival and one king size bed. So naturally, when we entered our room (right by the elevators) we found we had two double/full size beds. Not king size, and even smaller than queen size! So my husband headed downstairs, spoke to the manager on duty and was told there were no other rooms, but that the next day they should have rooms become available and we would be switched to another room. He also said to just leave all our bags packed the next morning and staff would move our suitcases to our new room. So that night we slept in kid-sized beds, as best we could with the constant noise of the elevator all night long! It literally sounded like a roller coaster! The room itself was seriously out dated and abused. We weren't expecting luxury here, just a certain standard of cleanliness and care in the room. Very disappointed. The next morning we headed out and, just in case, stopped at the front desk to remind someone about our room change. No one knew a thing about it. No notes were left by the manager for anyone to follow up on. But they did change our room to one in the Hilton Honors tower. We thought that sounded great, but it still turned out to be less than what you would expect of a Hilton Hotel anywhere else. Again they put us right next to the elevators, but at least in this building you couldn't hear it. The room was......okay. Nothing great, just okay. There were stains on sofa and carpet, a hole punched in at the base of bathroom entryway (odd) and a leak in the bathroom ceiling that landed on the bathroom counter. (I had noticed a stinky wet towel on the counter when we arrived and figured the maid had left a dirty cleaning towel there by accident. No, the maid had left a towel there on purpose to sop up all the dirty water that leaked through the ceiling! I had to keep doing the same every day to keep my personal items from being soaked!) We didn't bother to change rooms again as I can't imagine that any of the other rooms in the BEST tower would be any different. Also, the parking is atrocious. Seems like the Normandie Hotel next door is quite the hot spot on Friday and Saturday nights, and they all park at the Hilton! So you can forget about parking on the street and or even in the hotel parking! Everyone parks there, hotel guest or not! We had no choice but to go with valet parking, and even still our car stayed exactly where we left in front of the lobby for about 2 hours because even the valets had nowhere to park it or even move it.The food and drinks at the hotel are overpriced, as expected. The pool definitely didn't look clean. The beach is okay, definitely not a Caribbean white sand and blue water beach....far from it!We really only picked this hotel because the location was convenient for our needs on this trip and because we figured (wrongly) that we could count on Hilton quality. If you require a clean hotel room with few visible signs of wear and tear, do not stay here. The lobby area is very nice, and deceiving if you think the rooms will be similar in quality. But the rooms are what matter to me, so I would definitely not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Horrible!!! (Don't go!!!) My family (party of 6) and I stayed at this hotel from August 11th until the 12th (one night) of 2008. The experience was horrible!!The condition of the hotel is terrible. IT NEEDS TO BE CLOSED FOR REMODELING URGENTLY! We stayed at the new tower and we were told, when I went to the Frontdesk to ask for a bedroom change, that bedrooms from the main building were in worst conditions. I was at awe! Just couldn麓t believe it. Just the executive floor rooms in the main building are ok, the nice lady told me.We had two rooms and I could see the following: Lobby were fine, halls麓carpet had dark stains, doors metal frames were rusted, doors were scratched, rooms carpets were stained, bathroom were in bad shape, balcony windows were rusted, beds were ok and sheets ok (the employees made an effort to make the hotel look in the best way they could, but it was just not possible due to the conditions of the premises).I went to the pool the next day with my children. They were green fungus on the wall of the pool (the water looked okay) and on the stairs. The kiosk where the hand the towels out was in a very bad shape (the wood was all scratched and dirty, just terrible). Overall the problem with this hotel is the conditions of its premises, the employees tryed to give us the best service possible and they were well dressed with very good manners (the bell boy was all sweaty and dirty though).Beware of the valet parking fee, try to park your car yourself or you will be charged USD21.45 for everyday your car is in the parking lot.I was told by the manager that the hotel is planning a remodeling, but it will be done at a slow pace without disrupting current operations. I recommend they shut down this hotel and do a complete remodeling (a serious one not like they suposedly did on the new tower). Prior to this time, I stayed at this hotel two years ago and it was fine (more than fine it was wonderful). I don麓t understand how in such a short period of time a hotel could be so wore down.Try another hotel in better shape, like Hotel El Condado or the Marriott (at the Condado neigborhood). Or Hotel Don Diego in the Old San Juan Area (by the cathedral).

<Content>Great hotel - right on the beach! We stayed at the Caribe Hilton before departing on our Celebrity Cruise in March 2008. It was a great hotel and a great location - very close to the port. Our room overlooked the ocean and had a nice sized balcony. The staff was efficient and extremely helpful. The only slight negative was that the AC was not that cool - but we were only in the room for a limited time. We will definitely stay there again when in Puerto Rico.

<Content>Mixed Review I stayed here with my husband and 6 year old child for 2 nights in July. We paid $210 per night including the buffet breakfast. The final bill totaled $560 after taxes, fees and parking. Well what can I say? In December 2006 I stayed here and wrote a fabulous review on this website. Now, I am disappointed that all did not go well. As others have mentioned, there is a problem with rooms in the old tower. An employee mentioned that a big remodel will begin in the near future. The AC could not be increased above 62 degrees. We changed room twice. The general atmosphere in the lobby is beautiful. It is classic 40's modern and is very cool. The rooms however, were shabby. Paint peeling, rusty pipes in bathroom etc... When I complained the staff were very accomodating and understanding. I get the feeling that they hear complaints all day long and must change rooms frequently for customers. I heard everyone complaining and lots of room credit charges being given. I guess I should have asked for financial compensation for my headaches. Instead, they just kept changing my room. The rooms never seemed to get much better. The kid activities were minimal. The game room had broken machines and a change machine that never worked. I inquired about the kids camp but it never seemed to be functioning each day. The pool is kind of dirty. The pool cleaning guys tried to clean each day.The buffet Breakfast (forgot the restaurant name) at the hotel was very good! As others mentioned, no direction is given. The hotel amenities are not explained. The business center offers 5 minutes free internet use. There is a cute rear garden with rare birds. All of this stuff I just happen to stumble upon. The gym is free and very nice with new equipment. Bread is provided next to the towel stand for fish feeding (fun for kids). But again, no one told me about it. The 9th floor VIP lounge is pretty good. Continental breakfast and evening dvoudores, cookies all day. During the day you can use the computer and you have your own VIP desk person to assist you with check out and concierge services. No one told me this, I just again, stumbled upon it. I was granted VIP lounge use after the foul ups with my room. FYI - the kids movie theater is only open during the winter holidays. The staff are hard working and very kind. They just have a hard job because the rooms are pretty crummy. If you go, you must request the new Hilton Honors Tower, otherwise you will have room issues. I'll try the Marriott Stellaris next time.

<Content>Not What I Expected All I can say about the Caribe Hilton is that it was just OK. The facility and grounds were fine and enjoyable but the room was totally NOT what I expected from a Hilton Resort. Our room was in the main tower on the 5th floor and I hated it from the moment we walked in. It is old and dated and in desperate need of a facelift. I have stayed here in the past (which is why I decided to stay here again) but it was nothing like I remember. It was very disappointing and I highly doubt if I would ever stay here again. For what we were paying I expected better accommodations. I have stayed at other Hilton Hotels and at least you felt like you were getting your money's worth even if it was not an executive suite ! This room does not hold a candle to those. I attempted a room change but was told by the staff member who checked us in that unfortunately there was nothing else available and would not be for a few days. Let's see where do I begin. On top of the fact that the room had seen better days, the TV did not work properly with or without the remote. The dresser had a door in front of it that was loose and coming off the hinges. We complained about both and they sent two people up to fix the door but the TV problem was NEVER resolved. At first they blamed it on the cable company, then on the remote, then on the TV itself. (however our friends across the hall had no problem with their TV from the start). Let's see what else...the air conditioning was difficult to control. One minute we were hot and the next we were freezing. We had a problem with the tub because the water would not drain properly. The bathroom also had loose fixtures. I spent the first four days trying to correct the various problems with the front desk staff and several managers. One manager explained that this is an old hotel and they are in the process of renovating...but it's a very slow process. The maintenance staff must be pretty busy round the clock ! We did however like the facilities, spa, and grounds. We were traveling with a 14 year old who enjoyed the pool. Most of the staff were polite and pleasant. All I can say is please heed the warnings on this website and do not be fooled by pretty pictures on the internet. For what they are charging, unless you are planning on staying in one of the executive suites (which I understand are much nicer)....go somewhere else !

<Content>Change in management - beware We stayed at this resort for a week. According to the friends we traveled with who have been coming to this resort for the past 10 years, things have slipped with the new manager. Staff confirms he has fired workers and kept middle-managers. This was apparent with the work slow down we experienced. Our room was older, but dirty. I can live with the missing art on the wall, but the mess in the fridge took hours for us to soak off and clean. On day two, our toilet quit working so we were moved to another room. It was okay though there were only two towels and the fridge, again, was dirty. On one occasion, due to the aforementioned work slow down, our room was not made up at all.The restaurants are ridiculously expensive and we ended up eating all meals except three, off the property. We paid $22 per person for a breakfast buffet and they didn't refill food items in a timely manner. The Atlantico charged $15 for a small burger and $11 for a wrap that was dry. The Spanish restaurant, while spendy, excelled with customer service thanks to friendly, and very funny, Victor. He was charming, funny, warm, helpful and I wish we would've eaten there more often. He is a diamond.Beware of the pool towel scam, they make you sign for pool towels and then charge you if they're not back by 6:00 p.m. We questioned this because their posted sign says you have until 9:00 to return them but the pool staff said no, 6:00 or you pay $20 per towel. If you go early you don't have to sign for the towels.Also be careful in the pool. On the weekend it was completely out of control (foul language, drinking, jumping off the waterfalls and other permanent fixtures, etc.). The pool staff did NOTHING to bring order to the chaos. We ended up leaving the pool when it appeared two very loud women were about to fight. It scared us. They now allow drinking IN the pool and hot tubs. We picked out litter, cans, plastic cups and removed glasses and bottles from the pool deck so that no one would get cut. The pool decks also are coated in a slime that really needs to be power-washed off. Be careful if it rains because they are SLICK. After overhearing two different couples complaining about some of the same things we decided it was time to talk to the general manager. He explained that since it was off season he only had staff at the pool during the weekend. We told him about the chaos and he pretty much blew us offEvidently there used to be a daily activity schedule but they have stopped handing that out. It's hard to find out what's going on and what you get for that 12 percent resort fee. So, I while I would give this hotel another chance it begs the question why? since there are so many other resorts in this town.

<Content>Expected More from a HIlton I sort of tagged along on this trip to Puerto Rico, so I did not choose the hotel. My first impression upon arrival was good... the hotel has a beautiful downstairs lobby. The room, however, was not up to the same standard. I will say the bed was extremely comfortable, but there were some other issues. The lock to the balcony was broken and the dead bolt on the door didn't line up. The security box also wasn't working, but someone came up and fixed it and it was fine as long as you didn't use the number one. The air conditioning was so cold no matter what you did to it and when I asked for a blanket, the best they could do was to give me extra sheets. The biggest problem for me was the moldy smell in the room which I'm pretty sure was from the dirty carpet... I could barely sleep the first night I was there. The carpet in the hallway outside the room wasn't much better. The bathroom was big and nice with a large shower that had an above head fixture as well as a hand held showerhead and two sinks... it was probably the nicest feature in the room.The hotel staff there was excellent. The people were helpful and so friendly and I actually had some nice conversations with a couple of them about Puerto Rico. The grounds were also nice, with pools and a swim up bar (which I frequented). I did feel the pool could be cleaner. I didn't really use the man made beach there. It's ok, just quite small and being man made, you miss out on the ocean waves since it's in a little inlet. I stayed in Isla Verde on a previous trip and thought the beaches there were gorgeous. It was nice to lounge around in the hammocks on the beach, though. I did like the fact the hotel offered some activities. I took yoga or pilates every morning by the ocean and it was wonderful. I was also impressed by the gym. There was also volley ball, latin dancing, and aqua aerobics for those that chose to take them. Being on a budget, I found the restaurants too expensive to eat in. The pool bar has a less expensive menu and I did order a veggie wrap that came with fries for $10 and I have to say, it was excellent. Beer was over $7 and a pina colada was about $10. (They were STRONG! As a person who can hold her alcohol, 2-3 of these would knock me out!) In talking to other guests, I found that they enjoyed the food (and at $45 for a steak dinner, I would hope so!). If money's no object, the convenience of eating in the hotel is great, expecially because the location of this hotel does not lend itself to many options within walking distance. Across the street there is a Subway, a little local place where you order at the counter and sit (I did this often... great for breakfast) and a liquor store. If you walk about 15-20 minutes down the road towards Old San Juan, there's a couple of gas stations with decent mini-marts and I did see something that looked like a burger joint as well as a KFC.If you want to go out, the taxis can get expensive. It's $12 each way to Old San Juan and if you want to go over the bridge right next to the hotel into Condado ( a much shorter ride... neither of them are long) it's $13.50 because it's in a different zone. We did this one night and it was dead in Condado... not even worth it except for the Latin restaurant we ate at.I would never go back to the hotel on location alone. I prefer Isla Verde with its nice beaches and bars and restaurants. I guess the Caribe Hilton is OK if you're not planning on doing much outside of the hotel and have money to burn. Just make sure you get a nicer room!

<Content>Nice Room But Overpriced/Not for Couples My husband and I stayed at the Caribe Hilton on the recommendation of our travel agent. We were staying one night in San Juan before going on our honeymoon on Royal Caribbean. Although the room and ocean view were nice, it was quite expensive ($350/night) and the hotel offered little else. The photos of the pool and grounds on the website looked enticing, but in reality were small. The hotel food available was expensive ($8 for a Bud Light and $16 for a hamburger!) so we opted to eat at the Subway a block away. The area around the hotel is run down and we were even told by a security guard to not leave the hotel grounds after dark. In addition, there were a lot of families with small children running around - which was not what we wanted for the first night of our honeymoon. After we ventured into Old San Juan, we wished we would have stayed there instead. There is plenty to do within walking distance (restaurants, bars, museum, etc.) and the hotel rates are much more reasonable.

<Content>Nice stay We stayed at the Hilton Caribe for 3 nights 7/28 to 7/31. Cab ride from airport to hotel for 3 people with 3 bags was $23. checked with others, and everyone paid under $25.Nice hotel, nice people working there, very clean. Lots of places to eat at hotel, some more expensive than others. Drinks are not cheap, pretty standard for resorts. No complaints.Our room was in the tower and was very nice. It was clean, the bathroom was updated and very nice. Our housekeeper was a wonderful lady that did a great job and went out of her way to make our stay comfortable. We had a small fridge in the room that we stocked with water and drinks from the shop across the street. No complaints at all.The beach area is sheltered by the man made reef area, we enjoyed it, great for kids to play in, and mine loved the big slide out on a float. We snorkeled every day at the Caribe beach and saw amazing fish! Highly recommend - they rent the masks/snorkels for $5 at towel hut. Every room can get a beach umbrella free of charge, and that made staying out for long times bearable.We liked the pool, although it is a small one. My child liked jumping off the sides into the pool, and the waterfalls. The pool does get a bit dirty, however, I saw them scooping and cleaning everyday.Only downside for this hotel is how far away it is to Old San Juan. We wanted to shop and sightsee, and heard cabs were about $12 to get to Old San Juan. We did walk to the bus stop, easy walk around the corner. Bus ride is easy and quick and no more than .75 cents. Bus stops running at 9pm. We went with a big group in cab and they charged us $3 per person instead of flat rate, so just be upfront with them.The bus stop in Old San Juan is right by cruise ships, and it's quite a bit of walking to get to the old forts and the other side of shopping area, so wear good shoes and bring a map. There is a free trolley that goes around Old San Juan, however we found that the cruise ship people took up all the seats and you could waste much time just waiting on a trolley. We had no problems with the trolley the day there were no cruise ships in port.We did eat at the Parrot Club- very good, highly recommend.

<Content>Expected a lot more The grounds of the hotel are superb, from the private beach to the pool bar. However, the accolades stop there. To start, the lady at the check-in counter wasn't overly welcoming. The in-room safety deposit box keypad wasn't working. The deadbolt on the room door wasn't working. The lock on the balcony door was about to fall off. The pool water was dirty. The room carpet was dirty, as was the carpeting in the hallway. Bathroom light was out. Overall, I would suggest staying elsewhere.

<Content>Very good!! I chose the Caribe for a pre cruise stay because of its proximity to the piers in old san juan. It was awsome.We arrived early (around 2 pm) and had to wait for our room to be ready. Check in time is 4pm, the bellstaff stored our luggage and we headed to enjoy the facilities, the front desk staff took our information to let us know when the room was ready. By 3pm they had already called us to give us our room. At the desk we noticed several other guests complaining about having to wait for their rooms since noon. As the bellman escorted us to the room I asked if it was frequent that guests have to wait so many hours like those other guests. He told me that this hotel runs full almost everyday, which makes it hard to have vacant/ clean rooms during the day for early arrivals. He also mentioned that the more of a hard time you give the front desk the worst of a room you will get. So beware.Thankfully our room was lovely, we stood in room 1865 at the tower building, it had the most awsome ocean view. The hotel layout is side ways so no room is ocean front but this side of the tower building is the only one where you wont see the roof of the next building in the hotel. Since it was the 18th floor we saw some of the front garden , a park , and the ocean, during the day you can even see the ships as the approach the pier. The room was spacious and had a great marble bathroom with a walk in shower instead of a tub. We always had fresh towls and sheets, although you have to request them, as a hilton standard the beds now have only a duvet instead of sheets.Since we are hilton honors members we have free access to the lounge in the executive level of the main building. It was nice because it offeres continental breakfast in the day and in the evening they have appetizers and cocktails, if you are not a gold or diamond member you might want to consider upgrading to the executive level to have this access because the food in the hotel is expensive and there are not much options outside the hotel unless you take a cab or rent a car. Walking distance there is a minimart, a small local coffeshop that makes great sandwiches and awsome eggs with bacon, and a subway restaurant. But thats about it. The options inside the hotel are good although expensive, they have a Morton's steakhouse, a pan- asian restaurant called Lemongrass, an Italian restaurant called Il Giardino and a Spanish restaurant called Madrid - San Juan. My favorite was Lemongrass, wonderful sushi. My least favorite was Madrid San Juan, the service was not so good and the food was just ok.The grounds are perfect, a nice big 3 tier pool,very kid frindly beach, plenty of hammoks to nap under the shade of the palm trees, we always were able to get umbrellas and towels, although the hotel was full we never felt crowded. They also have a nice quiet tropical garden with a pond with swans in it, also they have peacocks that stroll around the garden , this garden also has a small pool that you can enjoy if you pefer to be in a more quiet and private surrounding. Our check out was ok we did the express check out option to avoid the lines, we booked with travelocity so we had to pay the extra resort fee and occupancy tax that is not covered by these wholesalers ( Travelocity, orbitz, hotels.com, priceline,etc) the resort fee is about a 12% of the rate and the occupancy tax is 5 dollars per person per day. If you book with a travel agency ask if its included so you wont be surprised when you check out.Also, be carefull when you give your credit card, as in all hotels they put a hold on the card for an estimated amount of your total nights rate with taxes plus 75dollars per day per person for incidentals, if you use a debit card these funds will be automaticly deducted from your account and you will not be able to use your money . If you use a debit card I suggest you withdraw the money and pay in cash. In my case i was promised they would not make a hold but rather keep the credit card number to charge me at check out. I gave them my card and a few moments later I checked my balance, they had taken an approval for 800 dollars, when my total stay did not sum up to 400 dollars. I had to wait a week to get the money back in my account.I would surely return to the Caribe hilton , the staff was always friendly and had a can do attitude,I always felt welcome. I'm already planning my next trip!

<Content>Great Vacation!!! We just came back from Puerto Rico last night. We stayed at the Caribe Hilton for 5 nights and loved every minute!We went with our friends, with whom we travel every summer, and stayed in Room 902 (they were in 901). These are Jr. Suites on the Executive Lounge level. The rooms were large, clean and comfortable with great ocean views. The Executive lounge was good for breakfast, afternoon and evening snacks. The staff was great: Omar, the Exec. Lounge concierge was helpful and even booked us at Restaurant Barrachina and arranged a front row table for the wonderful flamenco show; Isabela, who took care of our room; Angel, the Asst. Mngr. who kept the magnificent grounds neat and clean and Hiram, the bartender at the swim-up bar.The only negative: we have preferred evening entertainment in the Oasis Bar.Would we book there again? IN A HEARTBEAT!!!!

<Content>Good Hotel Stayed at the Caribe Hilton in late July 2008. In my stay I was able to experience two towers of the hotel. First they put me in the Main Tower. This part of the hotel was just ok. It was older, but the rooms looked renovated with new furniture  large bathrooms with two sinks  an overhead rain shower. The bad part of the room was my view looked at a construction site,  the noise woke me up every morning. After 2 nights of my air conditioning breaking down  the staff trying to fix it, I asked for a room change. The Hilton staff was somewhat unwilling to do this (said the hotel was booked  could not change rooms), but after talking to a manager I was able to be moved into the Executive Tower. This part of the hotel is much nicer. The rooms are newer, although bathrooms are smaller (no rain shower) than the older tower. I had an awesome view of the beach  ocean. This tower also has the executive lounge where they have breakfast every morning (bagels, fruit, pastries, cereal, coffee)  hors devours after 5pm. In both towers the rooms I had featured safes  small fridges. The resort part of the hotel is nice. They have a 2 tiered pool, hammocks, a gym  tennis courts. The private beach is a little small,  the water was somewhat choppy. Old San Juan is around 15 min by bus  the bus stop is a 2 min walk from the hotel. Condado is about a 15-20 min walk from the hotel. If you take a cab its about $15 to each destination.One of the problems with the hotel is the area. Besides the resort  neighboring Normandie hotel, there is not much around. If you want to eat quick, the only options to eat close to the hotel besides the overpriced hotel restaurants is Subway Sandwich across the street.After visiting Condado, I wished I stayed there because of proximity to restaurants  nightlife. There are many nice Casino/Resort Hotels there, and a ton of restaurants on that strip within walking distance. So, if you're a person who doesn鈥檛 want to walk, take a cab, or bus every time you want to eat stay in Condado.Overall, my stay at the Caribe Hilton was decent. Although, I'm not sure if it would have been as good had I not been able to switch rooms  have access to the breakfast lounge. Like I said, if I was to stay in around the San Juan area again, I would probably stay in Condado. Extra Info: You will be charged a resort fee every day of your stay. Also, had some good pizza at Via Appia in Condado  if you're looking for close nightlife to the hotel the La Concha in Condado is nice. The lobby  pool of this hotel have a Miami nightlife feel. Good looking crowd, good music. Must do tours:The Rainforest TourThe Biobay Tour (watch your hand glow in the water!)

<Content>Wonderful Experience We were a bit apprehensive after reading some of the negative reviews on this site. However, we noticed that the majority of reviews were positive and went in to the stay hoping for the best. We wouldn't be disappointed! The hotel grounds, gardens, pools, beach, and overall scenery and views were spectacular! The staff was all very friendly, helpful, and always willing to go out of their way to make the stay more enjoyable. The staff at the pool bar was wonderful - especially Hiram who always remembered our names and what we wanted to order (we usually ended our days at the pool bar). We stayed in the HHonors tower on the 19th floor and our room was very nice with a great ocean view. The mini fridge in the room was nice to have and the remodeled bathroom with the tavertine shower and double sink was beautiful as well. The executive lounge was nice to get the evenings started with light snacks and cheap drinks. The breakfast in the lounge was very adequate and the free soda and water was great during the day. We did a lot of our eating at local restaurants (highly recommend the Parrot Club and Raices) but did eat at Morton's at the hotel. It was expensive but one of the best overall meals we've ever had! We did use the spa for massages and were pleased with those services as well. Overall, we had a great experience at the Caribe Hilton and would not hesitate to return or to recommend to others!

<Content>Ok - Great Potential We stayed four nights at Caribe Hilton. Checking in was easy. The resort looks nice on the outside, clean grounds, well lighted in the evenings. Being a diamond member I expected a nicer room then we got. Didn't seem like an upgrade to any standards. The lobby was nice. Our floor needed a nice new fresh coat of paint. Our room was ok - STANDARD small balcony to sit out and enjoy a nice cup of coffee. The bathroom was the best part of the room, larger then most standard rooms travertine shower double sinks. There is a mini refrig. in the room.Executive lounge is nice we used it several times. They charge for your alcohol in this exec. lounge, most others do not. They do however have a great set up for breakfast, snacks and light dinner items. We were impressed. The staff is very kind.The pools are nice there are several. Beach is ok - very kid friendly. They have activities going on every hour (I liked that). Food is expensive, but you expect that at a resort.We toured Old Puerto Rico and found it to be interesting, fun, and safe. I would visit again and stay at this resort.

<Content>Best of everything especially the staff Since AAA Travel ruined our arrival time I didn't know what to expect,however we were totally surprised how accomodating the staff was especially Sonia who helped make an error by AAA into a most wonderful experience.I can not say enough about the most helpful and courteous staff,best I have seen in over 30 years of traveling.Efrain our breakfast server was terrific especially helpful giving us places to visit during our stay. The hotel is amazing,the views are great,grounds spacious and spotless,the pools and ocean views wonderful. The words that come to mind during our short stay,breathless,beautiful,outrageous. I only wish we had more time to enjoy the accomodations.Thanks to all at The Caribe Hilton.Rich Deo

<Content>Perfect weekend getaway I spend three nights with my partner at the Caribe Hilton in June and had a perfect weekend. Yes, it's pricey to eat and drink in the hotel, but you know that before you get there! I'm a Hilton HHonors gold member and we got an executive floor room in the main building. Despite being the oldest part of the property, the room was modern, clean and attractively decorated. We also had access to the Executive Lounge with free breakfast, soft drinks all day and evening cocktails and food. (The cocktails aren't free, but at only $3-4 each they are a third of the price of downstairs!)We spent much of our time relaxing on the beach and by the pools and although the hotel was busy, the area was never overcrowded. The main downstairs bar had a lively atmosphere every night, with great rum punch and mojitos. We also ate at Morton's, which was elegant and excellent as always - and it has windows overlooking the ocean - the only Morton's I've been in with windows!A 10 min walk takes you over the bridge to Condado for many casinos, restaurants etc. and a short cab ride takes you to Old San Juan.I would definately go back to the Caribe for a relaxing weekend again!

<Content>inconsistent room quality and overall horrible experience I was booked for four nights and five days for a fairly expensive conference rate (close to 200/night) and was very disappointed. I stayed in the lagoon villa section. The room overlooked an active construction site with a polluted lagoon. The water in the shower and sink ran black and sooty for three minutes before looking somewhat clear enough to take a shower. I had multiple cockroach sightings. The smell of mold was overwhelming. Several others in our group have commented similiarly about the run-down condition of this hotel. When I asked for a room change, information was recorded, but then I never heard from anyone. When I checked they pretended like they had never heard the complaint before.Last but not least, the internet connection was slow and very spotty....

<Content>Service was terrible, room was ok, food was expensive We stayed here for a romantic getaway. When we arrived we could tell the service was going to be an issue. The valet/check-in stations were not well organized. We went to valet the car and told a guy we wanted to park. He told us to leave the car and then he forgot about it. We went to check in (which took 30 mins!...no one is in a rush here) and they still had not moved it. We walked over to the car and told them we wanted it parked and then they took care of it. Once we got checked in we asked to have our bags delivered to the room. After waiting 45 minutes, we called and they said they would send them up. After 15 more minutes we went downstairs to find them still sitting where we left them. We ended up taking them up ourselves.We ate by the pool and ended up spending $100 on 2 drinks each and sandwiches! We ate at most of the restaurants and found the food and service to be average with the exception of Lemongrass. While this was our most expensive meal (we ate just apps and drinks and it was still $150!) it was by far the best meal of the trip. I found the pools to be a bit chilly, crowded and noisy with lots of kids. We actually rented a car and drove to Ponce for the day. We stumbled across a place called Copamarina and will stay there next time. The pools were perfect, spread out and they had more activities on the beach (parasaling, snorkeling etc. right outside the room door!)

<Content>Nice surpirse My family and i stayed at the hilton caribe in Arpil for 2 nights. I have to say i was really worried when i got this hotel thru priceline becasue the reviews i read very mixed. Let me tell you. I loved this hotel. Ther service was very nice and the rooms very modern and tastefully decorated. They very a little small but that was ok. The bathroom was very nice and good size. Two sinks and a very nice shower. I always love a nice bathroom. One other thing i really liked was the mini refrigerator in the room. What a nice thing to have with 2 little ones. The hotel also has some toys for little kids which was a big plus for us. My kids really loved it. They also have nice shops. The only thing i can say bad was the pools. When we were there, the pool water looked very green. It did not look fresh and clean. No one was using the pools. I think they were aware of this and cleaning the pools. Nice little beach there too. Over all I had a plesant time and I would for sure go back to this hotel if i ever go to puerto rico again.

<Content>Fabulous Old School Glam Beach Hotel We had an altogether too brief day and a half at the Caribe, and a fabulous dinner at the very romantic Lemongrass there. The beach is small, but the water and views are perfect. We stayed at Copamarina earlier in the week and I preferred the beach at the Caribe. The open air lobby, the hammocks by the beach, and the view of the old city wall are a few of the many nice details to the architecture and landscaping. It was old-school, 1950s hotel glamour. I really enjoyed it. One caveat--we splurged on a villa and really, the hotel grounds are so nice its not worth the money to be in a plush but surprisingly small room.

<Content>Nice hotel We stayed at the Caribe Hilton from 5/14-5/18 and loved our time here. We usually take a nice vacation once a year, and since we let our passports expire, we thought we should try Puerto Rico. The location of the resort was ok, right in the middle of everything, and an easy cab ride to Old San Juan, and Isla Verde. I would have to say that is the only downside of the property, is that you have to take a bus or cab and can't really walk to anywhere that is close. I highly recommend the Condado Area.. lots of places to eat outside the hotel (Danny's Pizza was awesome) and it's close to a couple of casino's. We ate at Morton's one night, great food, nice atmosphere, what you would expect from a nice steakhouse. We did however eat at the Parrot Club in old San Juan two nights. It was one the best places I have ever eaten, hands down. I recommend getting only appetizers and ordering a few, they were all outstanding! Don't forget desert also, the banana spring rolls were amazing! OK, be sure to see the forts. Both are really awesome if you like history. As for the rest of the hotel, lobby, pool, restaraunts were all first class and we enjoyed the pool bar immensly. Hiram and Jose will take good care of you if you take care of them. The room was a little Dumpy for being a Hilton, but I know the place is old. All in all, I would defintely recommend the hotel. Everything people said about prices are true, but if you are prepared, it's no big deal. It's not Mexico. Enjoy!

<Content>Love this place Got a good price from Priceline. Upon check-in, a very nice guy at frontdesk gave me a great room in the HH tower where complimentary breakfast and all day long snacks + fruits + beverages are served. You need to have a HH membership in order to get all these. Nice pools but the beach is not a great one for swimming. A small fort in located in the hotel but it was closed for renovation during my stay.Room is nice, clean, big and with great view of the ocean and city. Staff very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Loved the Caribe Hilton Stayed this past weekend at the Caribe Hilton and absolutely loved it. Arrived around 2 PM but was advised that the room wasn't ready yet. The woman at the front desk advised that the standard check-in time is 4 PM but gave me a card with a phone number to call to find out if the room may be ready sooner. Sat down in the lobby and within 10 minutes one of the managers came over, saw the card, took it, said he would check for other available rooms, and came back with 2 card keys and directions on how to get to the room. That is what I call service and paying attention to detail as well as to your customer. Was placed in the Main Hotel. The room and the hallway had been renovated but could tell there had been some water damage in the room. No mold or stale smells though. Bathroom had some upgrades but could use some more work to give it a more polished modern look. However, it was clean and nice size and after a day some of the older features had developed a certain charm. No complaints on the room, everything up to date (minus the LCD TV), extremely comfortable bed, balcony with table and two chairs, and refrigerator (a microwave would have been nice too). Ate at Palmeras twice and had the buffet. The restaurants like most hotel restaurants are pricey but the food was good. For those without a rental car, there is a subway and a ice cream shop at the end of the block. Went there a couple of times to help offset the more costly meals. Also, took a cab to San Juan ($22 round trip) for sightseeing and to try some other restaurants (about a 10 minute ride there and 15 minute ride back due to the increased traffic). The recreational areas of the hotel were truly spectacular. From the tranquil garden area to the pool and beach areas. The hammocks and the fish feeding pier were nice extras. Always plenty of staff in the pool area adding chairs as needed and keeping things maintained. I will definitely be back!

<Content>Overall a Great Resort Just returned from a three night stay at the Caribe Hilton. This is a great resort, we had a wonderful time. The open air lobby is very nice and all of the staff we dealt with were excellent. The pool and beach areas are both very nice. You can rent kayaks and pool/beach toys at the hut which is located in between the beach and the pool area. There were waiters on the beach on the weekend, but not the weekday I was there. Also, on the weekend, there is yoga on the beach at 9:00 a.m. which was very good.Not to be overlooked is the small cafe in the spa building which is located at the end of the beach, in a seperate building from the hotel. They make wonderful fresh, made-to-order wraps here which we got for lunch everyday and took out onto the beach with us. They also have breakfast items and smoothies. The wraps were only about $10 each and much healthier than the menu at the pool bar.The store just across the street is a great place to go to stock up on water, beverages, and snacks. The rooms do have a refrigerator so you can keep your snacks cold. The rooms were very nice, the beds were great. The balconies are big enough to enjoy a cup of coffee on and feature a small table and two chairs.Having a Starbucks in the lobby was great. A coffee and a bagel in the morning will run you about $5.My only negative remark would be not necessarily about the resort but about Puerto Rico itself. The shoreline is very built up, one high rise hotel or condo building after another. The buildings just seem to be on top of each other near the water. It is not a deterrent once you familiarize yourself with the resort, but when I first arrived I was a bit disappointed with how congested the area was.

<Content>nice but boring This hotel is great to stay at if you are on a family vacation or on business. The rooms themself are 3 star quality, but the lobby, amenities, restaurant, etc are all 4.0-4.5 stars. If you are coming to San Juan to party and have a good time, this hotel probably isn't where you want to stay unless you are in a big group and can have fun no matter where you are.

<Content>Better than I Expected But There's Room for Improvement I stayed at the Caribe Hilton from May 5th - May 8th. I liked a lot of things about the hotel (the open-air lobby, the Starbucks, the cleanliness of the rooms and the tropical garden) but there were a few issues:1) There was no one at the check-in desk when I arrived. If you were Hilton Honors or a VIP your line was staffed but there was no one there for normal check-ins. Not the best first impression.2) Room service trays and garbage were not picked up promptly from the hallways. When my next door neighbor had dinner his tray of half-eaten food remained outside the room until lunchtime the next day. This happened more than once.3) Beach service was spotty. One day there was someone taking orders but the next day there was no one to be seen. I don't mind getting up to get my drinks and food but sometimes you just want to veg out and not move.4) Food and drink prices are extraordinarily high. $10 for a Bud Light! That's ridiculous. 5) There needs to be a higher level of attentiveness to guests from some of the staff. One evening when I tried to get a cab to take me to the casino at the El San Juan Hotel, it took 5 minutes of standing around before the staff stopped chatting with each other to ask if they could help. All in all, I had a great trip because the weather in PR was wonderful and the beach at the hotel was really all I needed for a relaxing stay. Would I stay here again? Maybe if I found a really great rate but it wouldn't be my first choice.

<Content>Wedding Anniversary  Stayed at the Caribe Hilton from April 17-21  LOVED IT! We got room 824 (original bldg)  don鈥檛 understand what another reviewer is talking about when they say there is smell  noise from the extractors belonging to the restaurant below. Maybe we were lucky (it was breeze the whole time), but never heard or smell anything  we sat on the balcony multiple times every day, at all hours. Service was great  very friendly. The room was a good size (junior exec rm-1 king bed) very clean  in good condition; the beds, pillows  linens were so fluffy, soft  comfortable. Normal size bathroom, especially compare to most European ones. We stayed on one of the executive floors, worth the extra money. Those floors are elevator key access only, good for extra privacy  security. They also give access to the lounge which has a wonderful buffet type cold breakfast, in the late afternoon-early night they have free appetizers  drink for half of what the hotel bars charge, during the day they have free sodas, water, cookies, fruit, nuts, etc. Didn鈥檛 try any of the restaurant, but the menus looked VERY pricey鈥︹€?The pools  grounds (not as expansive as when I was a child) still wonderful. The small private cove-beach is perfect, no waves to knock you off your feet, crystal clear water  the peace of mind that we could snooze off without being concern with our belongings. My only complaint is that the hotel didn鈥檛 have enough large beach umbrellas  the 鈥渙ther鈥?ones they were giving us (2-3 to cover two chaise lounges) were this $9.99 pieces of garbage way below the stature of a Hilton. We are a couple with no children but the hotel is perfect for families鈥?w/children. And last but not least, don鈥檛 miss feeding the fish (even if you are not a kid)鈥︹€︹€︹€?/p>

<Content>Loved the Hilton, Hate the Hampton Inn After my first trip to Puerto Rico and staying at the one star hotel called the Hampton Inn priced at $179 a night, for only only an additional $16 I booked the week at the Hilton Caribe Hotel. What a difference, first of all the people are so friendly and tell you the reality of the island. I wanted to go Scuba Diving, they informed me what was the best way and to avoid any of the locals because everyone comes back disappointed; which I followed and it was awesome! The property itself was very cool, great pool scene, cool restaurants, awesome gym and private beach area. The room was great, cold a/c, the scene from the room you looked over some restaurants, but when you come in at around midnight you only see stars and hear the beach. The executive center is not as nice as others I have been to, like in Ecuador or Argentina; but the staff was very accomodating. All in all, this is where I am staying from now on, when I go to Puerto Rico.

<Content>Loved the Caribe Hilton We went for my son's 4 year old birthday and the hotel was excellent. Since I am a Diamond Hilton Honors member, we were upgraded to the Condado Suite, which is 2 bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths. The views from the 20th floor were excellent.The Executive lounge had a continetal breakfast, snacks all day and drinks from 5:30-8pm. The happy hour drink prices were $3-$4 a drink, very reasonable.My wife didn't care for the breakfast too much since there wasn't much protein on the breakfast bar but alot of carbs. Since it was part of the room charge, the lounge served its purpose since my son could eat alot of fruit and cheese.The onsite hotel restaurants were ok and we ate at the pool restaurant everyday. Kids under 5 eat free if there is an adult meal purchased.We would recommend this hotel to all families with children. The pools are excellent and the beach is protected with no waves to knock the children over.

<Content>Heaven!!! A+++ Best Hotel Stay Ever!!! Where do I begin, from the moment I stepped foot out of the taxi to The Caribe Hilton's dramatic and expansive open-air entrance...I was met with the warmest of welcomes! First of all, this self-described NYC Sex and The City gal is not used to Taxi drivers jumping out and opening the door for her but in PR, that's how it goes and it was...LOVELY!Where do I being...Israel, the Bellman that helped me when I arrived was eager to grab my belongings and help me settle in, you can tell that the entire Bellman team enjoys their positions and that they are a happy team. Miss Maity (the Pre-Arrivals Manager) made sure that I had accomodations on the Exec Level floor and was as lovely in person as she was on the phone. That Front Desk area is quite the pressure cooker but she and the rest of the Front Desk team handle things well and really try to make the guests' experience the BEST it can be.The Executive Lounge was the BEST, BEST, BEST!!! Mr. Omar helps keep things as smooth as possible and besides being extremely easy on the eyes , he is a very good manager... if you go to the Execd Lounge and see a man that looks like a Latin movie star in a custom-made Armani suit - THAT'S OMAR! Omar helped make it possible for me to extend my stay another two days and treated me like a VIP. Another Exec Lounge associate worth mentioning is Miss Annia who is both super-professional and sweet as sugar and is a real asset. The lounge is just a great place to enjoy a delicioso cafe con leche and meet other nice travelers in a calm setting. The Continental breakfast is lovely and the servers are quick to keep things tidy; there's a certain code of conduct you see up there from the staff and they are all lovely people con clase.The best part for me outdoors is the hammock area; imagine swinging in between two huge Palm Trees for hours - it's this sort of experience that blew me away because despite the grand size of the hotel, there are still...quiet...places...for...simple...solitude.Chef Pagan at Lemongrass (on premise) is a big star; a likeable guy that has created the most beautiful Asian fusion restaurant overlooking the Hilton's Tropical Gardens. Try his Cardomon Ice Cream - fantastico! Sit in the open air sofa area and have a Mango Martini and some appetizers (blue fin tuna on top of plaintains served maki-style). Just wonderful.Also, the Housekeeping Staff is lovely and get ready for the BEST BED OF YOUR LIFE!!! These beds are UNREAL. I even went on [--] to buy the pillows!!!One last note, my friend and I found beautiful branches on the beach that we wanted to bring home but someone suggested that we have them lacquered - well, I asked a bellman about this and within 5 minutes, someone from Engineering came to my room to do this for me! Can you say SERVICE! I stayed here after a 4 day stay at Las Casitas at the El Conquistador and I can say without hesitation the the Caribe Hilton and its' pride-filled staff will exceed your expectations to the point that you will invariably R=E-L-A-X like never before. It's private beach, close proximity to Old San Juan and EXCELLENT Customer Service make this the best hotel experiernce I have EVER had (and I've stayed at The Breakers in Palm Beach, The Williamsburgh Inn. etc)I am going back in a few weeks and taking my best friend - it was THAT GOOD!Two more things: There is a bus near the hotel that'll take you to Old San Juan for 75 cents, it takes 8 minutes and it is 100% safe. FYI, stores in Old San Juan basically close at 6PM. Restaurants close by 8:30 or 9PM. Have a cup of coffee at La Bombanera during the day!!! HILTON BED = LA BOMBANERA COFFEE!!!ENJOY YOUR MAGICAL STAY!!!

<Content>Great Hotel Great Location Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 children ages 4 and 8) spent 6 nights at the Caribe Hilton. Our review is as follows:Check In: Not so great, we arrived at 2PM and didn't get a room until after 4PM. Granted the check in time is 4PM, but the wait was longer than I expected.Room: Bedroom was well maintained with a very comfortable bed, we didn't have the flat panel TV, but other rooms in the tower and executive floors did have them. The carpets are clean and well maintained as was the furniture. There was a lot of storage space which is a plus.Bathroom: Was well maintained but there was a tile missing in the shower. The sink faucet and countertop were in good condition.Grounds: The grounds of the hotel were well maintained. The pools are large and accommodated the people using it very well.On Saturday and Sunday, chairs weren't available around 2PM all other times, chairs were available.The beach was great and shallow. It was never crowded and only had some leaves floating on the water. Others: The gardens and lobby are well maintained.Restaurants: I didn't eat anywhere expect for Atlantico for lunch and the food was OK, It was expensive but the kids ate for free or half price. Good drinks but expensive. Starbucks was good.Executive Lounge: Very nice with good selection for breakfast. They have an espresso machine that made fresh cappuccino, I was in heaven. They also have cookies at night and drinks at 5 (at $3 a drink they are a bargain).Location: Great location with a private beach, close to Condado and Old San Juan. We drove to Old San Juan every night and had dinner there.Overall: The hotel was great for families and you could enjoy yourself without feeling crowded. Remember the hotel has over 800 rooms.Puerto Rico Itself: Awesome island, great people and great food in old San Juan. Try Raeces, Sofia and Il Trammerli they were great.

<Content>Blah This is a very old property and no matter how much they renovate it still shows it's age. New carpet, furniture and paint cannot hide the fact that the moldings are rotted and warped, the doors are thin as cardboard and everything is just old and tired looking. The bathroom is small and the balconies are tiny.Apart from the bartenders at the swim up bar (they are great) the service was mediocre. It took me literally 30 minutes to check in and get clarification that I was supposed to be on a Club level floor. Restaurant service was ok, not bad. Food was expensive (like everywhere else) and mediocre.The Pool was dirty in spots and tired, hot tubs were not hot in the least. They do have a nice little protected beach for kids to swim but the water is like the beaches back here in New England (except warmer of course) and not the nice Carribean blue that you hope for.I wouldn't think of staying here again. I guess we got what we paid for as this was a last minute trip and the Hilton was cheaper than other places in the area that we were looking at.

<Content>Great place to stay The Caribe Hilton is classy and EXTREMELY clean. I didn't even see a single bug in my room the whole stay. We loved the reception we received upon arrival. And in our room, there was a slight problem with the toilet that they took care of immediately once I called about it. The beds were very comfortable  the room had a nice amount of dressers, desk space  closet space. The restaurants are so expensive! The breakfast buffet was $24 per person, with no lower price for kids - and dinner buffet was $30 per person. Ridiculous! We quickly learned to favor the Starbucks for our breakfasts  snacks, and the staff there was the friendliest. Some of the hotel staff were a little snobby, like a few of the valet parking people - esp. over the phone. I hadn't planned to use the valet parking (an extra $5 per day on top of the $15 per day to park) - but otherwise I would have had to schlep across the street to a parking garage with construction all around. I felt maybe a bit of resentment of the guests from some of the staff, and I thought I was a pretty great tipper....It was a little boring at night - we were only there Monday-Friday, and apparently there is no entertainment until the weekend. Basically, you are faced with added costs every way you turn - but otherwise, it's a great, comfortable, beautiful hotel, with several different eating options, nice pools, nice beach area,  some other nice amenities.

<Content>Overpriced hotel My family stayed here post cruise for one night. This was a very nice, clean hotel but not worth the money. It is considered a resort which is why it probably costs more. The food choices were outrageously expensive for a family of 4 to eat at. The only restaurant within walking distance was a Subway. The pool area was nice for kids and there was a nice beach that appeared to be man-made. Overall we had a good experience here but I just felt it was overpriced.

<Content>One of best in San Juan I go to PR 3-4 times per year on business and have stayed at all the larger San Juan hotels over the years. When I bring my wife , I stay at the Hilton. Rooms are generally good but try to stay in main buildings as outlying buildings are a bit of a walk from the lobby and some have bad views (of construction sites and the back side of the lagoon). The grounds are among the very best and cover the largest area of all San Juan hotels. Never a problem getting a good chair around the pools and the grounds are very well maintained. Beach has a breakwater so there are no waves, great for less aventuresome waders and swimmers. Closer to Old San Juan than other larger hotels but a car or taxi is needed to get to Old San Jaun or to the Condado for the best San Juan restaurants.

<Content>Stay Elsewhere! Stayed here last week and will not be staying again despite that I'll have to travel to San Juan quite often for work.I checked in after a long, crappy day trying to get to San Juan and was looking forward to konking out in my room. The check-in was easy, however, only one of the two keys I was given worked. Additionally, there were several other pieces of paper in my folio which were not described. Still have no clue what they were for. Got to my room  expected a bit nicer being a Hilton Honors member. The room smelled musty  gross and it was very chilly. Tried turning up the temperature to no avail. Called Guest Services who advised Engineering would be on their way. Called Guest Services again 30 minutes later to see if they were coming that evening or when. The engineer tinkered with the unit and advised it was fixed. Unfortunately, it never did warm up, but I was too tired to deal with it and went to bed.Arrived back in the room after a day long meeting to find it freezing yet again and really, really smelly - like sewage. Had received a voicemail from the Hotel hoping my stay was going well and if there were any issues, to call the Manager on Duty. I tried calling the MOD, but no answer so I called Guest Services again. They sent up another engineer and housekeeping. This guy at least tried longer to fix the unit  housekeeping sprayed the room with some stench cover-up. Neither worked. I was checking out the following morning  didn't feel like dealing with the lack of service that was evident throughout the hotel, so I just went to dinner and then came back to the hotel to sleep. Had I been staying any more time, I would have complained to the front desk  to the Management. Not sure what good it would've done, though.Considering the Caribe Hilton? I would highly recommend you stay someplace else.

<Content>Great vacation at the Caribe Hilton! Had a wonderful spring vacation at the Caribe Hilton. I was very apprehensive on booking this hotel because the reviews were either great or horrible, however, I could not of been more pleased. I was traveling with my wife and two children ages 7 and 11. The hotel pool and beach area were perfect for them. My son loved snorkling so much that it was hard to get him out of the water. Plenty of fish to look at along the rock wall they constructed to make their lagoon. The pool was clean and inviting with plenty of chairs. We mostly sat at the beach and had the attendant put up an umbrella, always tipped a couple of dollars and they remembered for the next day. Service was excellent at the towel hut and a couple of dollars tip goes a long way in getting good service. There was bingo and pina colada tasting every day, the rest of the advertised activities did not always appear to go off. There was always day old bread available to feed the fish off their pier which went into the Atlantic. The hotel lobby was open air and reminded me a hotels in Hawaii. For a hotel nearly 60 years old this hotel was renovated to stay up with the times. Got my room on Priceline for $110 a night so I was sure I would get a room on the first floor looking at the AC units or dumpsters. Was pleasantly surprised to get a room in the HHonor Tower (I am only a HH blue) room 766 looking out at the Atlantic. The room was modern and the bathroom was luxury. The shower was a huge walking in shower with two shower heads including a rainfall shower head which was great for a tall person as myself. Never had any problems with hot water as some had mentioned, but I am not up before 6am. I believe all rooms are non-smoking as they mentioned this at check-in was the Puerto Rican law, which was perfect as I hate smoking rooms. They had very comfortable beds which had down feather pillows and comforter which my wife is allergic to, so I had housekeeping come make up new beds, which actually took three seperate trips. However, my wife gave the housekeeper a $20 tip and she was more than happy to get it taken care of. Must of had the same housekeeper take care of our room a couple of days later as we got extra towels, soap, and toiletries. It is amazing what a few kind words and a couple of dollars can do to improve the attitude of the workers around you. Breakfast a Palmeras was excellent and the kids eat for free. Dinner was good at the hotel, but we eat most of the meals outside of breakfast away from the hotel or at the beach. $10 - $12 cab ride got you into Old San Juan which is a beautiful old city. $22 - $25 cab ride to the airport. Rented a car to go the El Yunque rainforest. Easy to drive around Puerto Rico and was not as dangerous as travel books had indicated.Overall we had a great time. My wife and kids said it was one of the best vacations that they ever had. We typically stay at Hyatt or Marriott's and I would rate the Hilton at the same standard as these type of establishments.Enjoy your trip to Puerto Rico.

<Content>Beautiful Resort We enjoyed our one week stay at the Caribe Hilton from April 2 thru 9, 2008. This resort property is wonderful. Beautiful grounds, great food, and friendly service. We booked an executive floor room to get the breakfast and evening snacks. Our room overlooked the pool and beach. The cost of meals and drinks here are very expensive, but we expected that. The weather for our stay wasn't great. We had a few days of rain and it was very windy everyday. We understand that strong winds are common here. We only took one tour - the city tour. Our advice is to take a cab ($10) on your own and make your own tour. The guided tour is not worth the money as most of the time you are on your own anyway.

<Content>Good Hotel, But.... The good things about the hotel are good: room was great (stay in the main building, not the additions); restaurants were very good (see exception) and the grounds and beach excellent. We enjoyed getting a piece of bread from the attendant and feeding the fish off the end of the pier!What wasn't good. The hotel is expensive with lots of nickel and dime items; what in the world did the maid do for a Maid Charge of 50 cents? The breakfast buffet was $17.00 without eggs, $23.00 with eggs. I didn't have eggs but was charged the $23.00 anyhow and had to complain. Plus, as is common with Puerto Rican hotels, on top of the room charge you're hit with a resort fee.So, it's a nice hotel with good, helpful staff and lots of niggling charges that add up quickly!

<Content>Services slipping I have stayed at this hotel since 1986 about once or twice a year for both business and pleasure. (I have also stayed at 7 other hotels in the San Juan area.) I have seen it when it was owned by the government and manged by Hilton through many changes including its current look which was put in place to accomodate large quantites of crusie ship passengers either going or coming from a cruise.Through all of the changes (5) the Caribe Hilton continues to have the best beach in the Condado area. It is worth going there for that alone. (If the beach is not important to you try El Convento). Another big plus, it is a 5 minute cab ride to Old San Juan (a real treasure).The level of service always seems to vary. At present the hotel staff is very courteous and tries to help, always with a smile. I did notice some of the more experienced older staff gone and the new people who were quite younger by comparison.The staffing at the Executive Lounge has been cut from 3 to one person. The snacks served in the Excutive Lounge were mostly bread and peanuts. Also, although they advertise being open unitl 9:30 PM for coffee and dessert. They closed all three nights that I was there (Fri, Sat, Sun) at 7:30 PMI had to help the person at the concierge desk book a golf trip with a car to take us there and back. I have been doing this trip for 3 yrs. In the past I had to only give the time to the person at the concierge desk. They arranged the rest. Again young, friendly but inexperienced. It appears that the valet staff is reduced during certain hours.Also the water in the shower was turned down to room tempertaure during the night and raised at about 6:00 AM. I called the front desk at 5:00 am and was told to take my shower after 6:00 AM.Overall occupancy appears to be down hence maybe some of the cutbacks. I subscrbe to a weekly business newspaper from Puerto Rico. All of the hotels in the San Juan area seem to be reporting a drop in occupancy this year.We did not eat meals at he hotel as we were out with local friends at some of our favorite restaurants. (this is perhaps my 80th trip to Puerto Rico). Our hotel just becomes a base of operations unless I am at a resort out on the Island. I did make it a point to eat breakfast twice at the Palmeras restaurant. Though pricey the breakfast buffet is first rate.

<Content>Great hotel, beautiful suite, few issues Nutshell:Hotel: Excellent Service, lovely groundsRoom: Fabulous but hot water is a problem. Housekeeping did a super job.Spa: Awesome service, facility and amenities need upgradingRoom Service: Perfect every timeMortons: Always a pleasure. Dropped a bundle on dinner and it was wonderful and we had a great time.Rotisserie Il Giardino: If I was the FB Manager at the Caribe Hilton I would shut it down immediately it was the worst restaurant experience I have had in years._________________________________________________My wife and I stayed several nights in a San Geronimo suite on a romantic getaway.The hotel is beautiful. The staff was very friendly. We didn't want to leave the room. In fact we wanted to stay an extra night and the staff was able to accomodate us.The San Geronimo suite is in one of the newer buildings on the hotel grounds and a short hike from the lobby. Even though the hotel was near capacity we never once had to wait for an elevator or even share an elevator. In fact, we never saw another guest in our building the entire time we were there. That was strange.The room was simply fabulous. It had a living room with a kitchenette (microwave, fridge and coffee maker) and 1/2 bath. It also had a balcony, sleeper sofa (not too comfortable to sit on, though), dining room table with 4 chairs and a 40 or so LCD TV. The bedroom had a very comfortable king size bed, another balcony, another TV, large closet, dressing area, and a surprisingly smallish bathroom. I was a little surprised that they didn't enlarge the bathroom but it was still very nicely equipped with great amenities.Problems in the room: Hot water was hard to come by. Eventually it came, however, it was quite annoying. We spent an afternoon at the Olas Spa and got some lovely treatments. The spa staff was very accomodating and they new how to give great massage and body wraps and I highly recommend them. The spa facility and amenities left a bit to be desired and felt old. They wanted us to shower twice but they only gave us one towel. All in all still very good experience.We had an amazing dinner at Mortons Steakhouse on property. We love Mortons. We drank too much, we ate too much and we laughed a lot. The wait staff was fun and we even made friends with some other guests there. It was a very inviting, warm atmosphere.Then the next night we had dinner at the italian restaurant on property, Rotiisserie Il Giardino, and it was exactly the opposite. We went in for dinner and the place was almost empty (a few tables seated). We were whisked to our table by the maitre d. The server brought us the menu and offered me the wine list (I was still nursing a hangover) which I declined and he all of a sudden got cold (since we weren't going to buy a $100 bottle of wine this night). We had some questions about the menu and he was very rude in answering. We placed our order which included 1 appetizer to share, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 2 cokes.Throughout the entire dinner, this waiter never approached us again (until later).Another guy, a young hard worker, brought out the appetizer with my wife's salad. I very nicely requested that he bring my salad because I expected the appetizer first before the salad. Of course, the waiter didn't put in a salad order for me. So I asked for a salad so that my wife and I could have salad together.The appetizer was just a simple bruschetta. The topping on the bread seemed like it had been blended rather than chopped and it tasted funny. And I don't think the bread had been toasted.The salad dressings tasted watered down.Then our main courses (delivered by yet another guy not our waiter). I had veal marsala which was okay. The potatoes and the vegetables were absolutely delicious. The entree was just okay. Passable. I could get just as good a dinner at the corner pizza shop and pay 2/3 less.My wife got some chicken thing that was wayyyyy too salty. But she, too, loved the potatoes.We never did get our Cokes. Right after they brought our entrees we stopped a busboy (or waiter, there's no telling) and asked for our 2 Cokes. Seemed like it got turned into a much bigger deal than it should have been and even then it took like another 10 minutes for us to get something to drink. A refill would have been completely out of the question.Right after we left (it took 15 freakin minutes to get our check after we declined their coffee and nasty dessert) we walked over to Starbucks for coffee and dessert and a good laugh.Anyways, stay away from this restaurant. Eat dinner every night at Mortons.Oh yeah. Back to the hotel.All in all we had a wonderful time. The weather wasn't great all week so we didn't do much at the pool or beach. It was windy every second of every day and rained a bunch.But we ventured out quite a bit and we enjoyed being tourists in Old San Juan and elsewhere on the island. Aside from a couple of minor inconveniences and one lousy restaurant experience we would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved the Caribe Hilton! My wife and I anguished over reviews of this and other hotels in P. R. before settling on the Caribe Hilton. We arrived the week after the last review and missed the storm but saw some of the left over damage.We are so happy with our choice. While we can't speak for the views from other rooms, our room 538 in the Main building had a beautiful view of the Pool Area as well as the Private Beach and the Ocean. We could see the Ocean from bed. The room was very clean and nicely furnished with Tropical Colors and Wood Tones. The Room was large,Comfortable and very Clean. The Grounds were extraordinary with many Pools, Hammock Groves and the only Private Beach on the Island. The service from the staff was the best we have experienced. The Hotel is in an area by itself so there's not much to do around but it's a 75 cent 10 minute bus ride to Old San Juan. Adjacent to the Hotel is a Large Public Beach and Park which is very nice and has lot's of Palm Trees for shade. There were many choices for restaurants (6) and some were fairly expensive and others were moderate. The Buffets at the Palmeras were very good including the Friday Night Seafood Buffet. Cheap Breakfast and Lunch can be had at the Subway Restaurant across the street. All in all we are very happy with our choice and look forward to returning to the Caribe Hilton.

<Content>Loved the Caribe We really loved the hotel. It was perfect for a family with young kids. We were there for a week and found the staff to be more than helpful and curteous, especially Gabriel at the Concierge desk. We stayed in the Garden Wing in a 1 bedroom suite which was Huge with spectacular views of the ocean and garden.The beach was terrific and the pools were beautiful.The only downside was that the staff for the kids program was hit or miss. My kids would have loved to have the activities a llittle more organized, but it didn't effect our stay. We took a day trip to the rainforest which was great. (on our own, not thru the hotel).We did not find the hotel to be very expensive, after all, it is a resort in the Carribean. The kids ate for half price at the pool bar and the restaurants in the hotel were g reat. We had free continental breakfast on the 9th floor of the main building which was great. All in all, it was a great trip.

<Content>not awful Our room was in the tower and was nice -- lovely bathroom and ocean-view balcony. Sadly, the week we were there there was an off-shore storm that created surf that Puerto Rico hadn't seen in two decades and all the beaches were closed. Then, a 25-foot wave washed over the sea wall and filled one of our pools with sand and debris. None of this was the Hilton's fault and they worked hard to get things back to normal. But it was Easter week and there were a zillion kids there. With the beach and one of the pools closed, it felt like a city pool at the remaining pool. The hot tubs were never hot, and I felt at least one of them should be reserved for adults. Kids belly flop in all of them all day. (Their parents seem oblivious.) As an adult with no young kids, I probably wouldn't go back. My adult daughter and I went to the casino at the Ritz Carlton one night and drooled with envy at the setting. I did, however, find the staff at the Hilton to be attentive and friendly, and the buffet breakfast included in our room was very nice.

<Content>LOVED this hotel and the safe beach!! We really loved it here, and like the other reviewers, wish we could have stayed longer! I didn't get a chance to visit the spa or make use of their free kayak/pedal boat hours, the salsa lessons, etc. Next time hopefully!There were a lot of activities, the pools were great, sipping on the pina coloda drinks (everyday free pina coladas around 1pm for a hr at the swimup bar) in the hot tub looking out at turquoise waters and a warm breeze in the many palm trees was amazing! There is a free breakfast room on the 2nd floor in the towers(just use your regular room key), and use of their excellent espresso machine all day, as well as pops, waters, cookies etc and a happy hour from 5-8. The best part was the beach, absolutely gorgeous with the fortified city walls and san geronimo fort framing each side of it, so effectively creating a small cove. This means that the water is shallow and is safe for families to swim. As is the case in many coastal destination spots, the undertow can be dangerous and drownings can occur. THe beach here is perfect : secluded, private and safe. There was never a problem to find lounge chairs and they freely set up umbrellas wherever you wanted.FOr kids, there is a slide in the ocean at 4ft, small play structure right on the beach and another park near the tropical fish pond, a pond with swans, daily feeding of the fish at the pier, hammocks, sandcastle building competitions, infant pool, a giant chess board outside, tennis court, basketball net, an indoor games room, craft/dance activities, a beach hut that lends out pails, shovels and water wings, etc. We will definitely be returning here!! The staff were very friendly and appreciated when you tried to speak Spanish.ps. the balcony in the room is quite nice to sit out and watch the waves.

<Content>Wish i had stayed longer Just spent a few days there and I had a pleasant experience from the time i arrived until the time i left. Will definitetly go back if i find a good deal on rooms as the hotel can be pricey.The grounds were beautiful, the pool was immaculate, the breakfast buffet was well stocked and varied. I went to Morton's steakhouse for dinner as well and even stepped into the starbucks for breakfast on another day. I wish i had had time to try out the spa!I love the open air lobby and my only inconvenience was that my room had two double beds and the one bed closest to the mini fridge had to be moved away in order to open the fridge. My room overlooked new construction unfortunatetly, so what would have been a nice view of the water, is now a parking lot and a new tower. I got construction noise around 9am or so but nothing too bad. I'd sleep with the balcony door open and had no outside noise all night so that was great (from either the cars or the villas guests that i faced. I even got to use the business center to print my boarding pass and the guy at the desk was helpful and very courteous. There is a gelato place on the corner at the entrance of the hotel with a subways and around the corner was the bus stop heading into old san juan for just 75 cents. (exact change only).

<Content>It's just OK My husband and I were away for our first vacation away since our children. I did read this website and was very confused by the reviews. One of the main reasons I choose this hotel was because it was listed as 4 stars and did not have a casino (my husband likes to gamble and I don't). I will say the service checking in was fine but when I realized the first evening that they did not mention the free breakfast that was supposed to be included we went back to the front desk. They did take a few minutes but then gave us new keys that let us into the executive floor dining area. I thought we scored big but I will say it is a basic continental breakfast and from 5 - 8 pm a cocktail hour that had awful appts. and one night only had one wine choose which had to be the worst wine of ever drank.I would say that the service and people were slow and rude but it seemed to be a common theme in PR. I thought the place was fine but more of a two or three star than a four star.

<Content>The Hilton was okay, PR is great! The Hilton Caribe is a nice place overall.( *I'm use to staying at really nice hotels like the J.W Marriott and Ritz, so that's my point of view).I stayed in the Villas with 3 of my friends ( 3rd floor w/ ocean view).The bedroom is an okay size- 2 queen beds, nice bathroom and nice balcony view of the condado.The kitchenette is cute, it includes a small fridge, sink, microwave, cabinets, and counter space.Bedroom Cons: not much floor space for luggage, no WIFI (which was a HUUUUGE disappointment). I couldn't believe that in 2008 Hilton didn't have WIFI in the bedrooms. But we were able to pick up the WIFI from the Condado Plaza Hotel (Mariott- i think) across the water. So make sure you know how to use your phone as a modem or bring some type of wireless card if you go. (they only have free WIFI in the lobby). Room service is really expensiveBedroom Pros: Nice clean linen, nice size bathroom, nice balcony, good service. You can also buy food and store it in the cabinets and fridge.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Hilton was not as glamorous as I thought it would be, but it is nice. The lobby was clean and it's kind of cool how it's connected to the outside- meaning that when you arrive to the hotel you get out of your car and automatically step into the lobby. The pool and beach area is great, simply nice. Its not grandeur, but its very extensive- the property includes alot: gardens, pools, jacuzzis, beaches, playground area, bars, decks, ponds, exotic fish and animals and more- I was not able to fully explore this area, but my friends were able to and they LOVED it.It's a great place for couples at night.The villas has its own separate lobby which is really small, but its somewhat convenient when you need help and information. But I did NOT like all the construction being built - because of the construction going on outside the lobby of the Villas, the outside of the villa area was ugly (very gray and gloomy).Overall Hilton Pros: perfect location- the Hilton seems to be in the middle of everything (Old San Juan (5 minutes away), the Condado (5 minutes away), Isla Verde(12 minutes away), Airport (15 minutes away) plus its a low traffic area so we barely got caught in traffic (which is everywhere in PR), the Hilton pool and beach area offers the widest variety of things to do, and nice people.Overall Hilton Cons: all the Construction, no WIFI, not very glamorous, lack of floor space in rooms w/ 2 bedsMost people say the Hilton is overpriced, but I personally think you are paying for the location over anything else b/c the hotel itself is not very ritzy- it's sort of aesthetically disappointing, but you have to keep in mind that this is Hilton's first hotel in the Caribbean (they actually consider it historic)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I also visited The Ritz, El San Juan Hotel, and the Intercontinental. The Ritz's beach was very disappointing and dirty.The intercontinental lobby, beach, and pool area was really pretty (i visited at night), but they all seemed kind of small (and their Casino is really small, but busy). El San Juan Hotel is the hot spot- the lobby is BEAUTIFUL and very grand i felt like i was in a fashion magazine- EVERY person there was BEAUTIFUL. It is veeeerry busy, so if you want to watch alot of beautiful people-go there. If you ever visit that hotel (especially at night) be sure to have your best and most fashionable clothes on w/ makeup  hair done etc. (women should wear dresses that compliment their body types with heels and men should just look clean and smell good). If you want to live the high life you should stay at a hotel like El San Juan, but if you want to relax you should stay at a hotel like the Hilton. El San Juan Hotel is sort of a place for single people (their are too many temptations there especially for men) and other hotels are better for couples and families.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OVERALL Puerto Rico Advice:First off, I lost my camera in a taxi on the first night which made me really sad (b/c i lost over 200 pics) and put a little damper on my trip. So I greatly advise everyone to find one taxi driver and stick with them throughout your stay (be sure to ALWAYS get their name, number, and taxi number or license plate). But moreover to Truly experience Puerto Rico you should rent a car. After my experience I advise you to use taxi's for a day, then drive after that- you can get more done and you feel more free!Places to visit:1. Old San Juan is a must at night (eat at a great restaurant and walk around and visit a club or three)2. The rain forest (this was probably the best day we had in Puerto Rico- it was BEAUTIFUL!)- bring water and/or drinks, oh and good shoes3. Culebra, Vieques, or Gilligans Island - you MUST visit one of the three (but visiting one of those will be an all day trip because you will need to arrive early and take ferries to them (so be sure to bring snacks, drinks, snorkel equipment, and an umbrella).4. Forts in Old San Juan (Fort San Cristobal is better than el Morro)5. For young people: -Isla Verde at night is a must, definitely go to the clubs, bars, and El San Juan Hotel -Senor Frogs (old san juan), Brava (el san juan hotel), and just ask around. . . (Vibes seemed nice, but we didnt get to go)6. The Condado at night is really pretty too, when we went there were singers and performers on the big lawn/park area.7. Ponce is a nice area with many historic places, gardens, etc. . .(old french town so it looks different from old San Juan).You should plan before you get there b/c its very easy to go astray and not get as much done as you want.Remember that EVERYTHING closes early (around 6pm) so tourist activities MUST be planned early and they must be done during the day. At night Old San Juan, the Condado, and Isla Verde are the best. . .If you drive be very cautious b/c people drive very loose down there. Though Puerto Rico is an American territory - 75% of the people their speak Spanish ONLY -if not more. So you should have a basic knowledge of spanish and download some type of translation program on your phone (i just used babelfish.altavista.com- which is an online translator). Walgreens are everywhere (and that will be your grocery and everything else store during the trip (we went almost everyday:-).---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall I LOVED Puerto Rico and I was not ready to go back after 5 days, I felt like I needed atleast 1 or 2 more days. I loved how racism and colorism just seemed to go out the window and everyone loved/liked each other for who they were and respected everyone's individual beauty. So don't be a typical stiff American when you go- relax, have fun, talk to random people no matter their background, race, or ethnicity.Most phone companies don't charge for using your phone in Puerto Rico, but call and make sure. Okay, I think my review is long enough. . .Vive (las) Puerto Rico! lol. . . .Adios!*make sure your camera has a strap on it and put your name and number on it- I would hate for anyone else to lose their camera.* you'll easily notice that most Puerto Ricans seem to be in relationships b/c everywhere you go there will be couples*as an attractive dark-skin woman of color i felt sooo Beautiful in Puerto Rico, everywhere i went i was told how gorgeous i was, not only by Puerto Rican men (and even some women) but by many white Americans (people seem to lose their prejudices in Puerto Rico)- this made my trip even better- i felt like a Goddess there:-)

<Content>Great place for the right price This can be a great place to stay depending on what you pay. We booked this on Priceline (bidding) for $115 per night. For that price it was a steal. We booked it for before and after a cruise. It is actually a very nice hotel in a great location and has an excellent pool and beach. The hotel has a large open air lobby which is nice but not as classy as the Wyndham El San Juan but nice enough. The hotel has been built in phases over the years. We were in the original building which I prefer since all of the rooms have great water views. Some of the later buildings have sections that look out on other buildings and parking garage, etc. The rooms are a decent size with nice bathrooms and very nice beds and bedding. The furniture is a little dated. The hotel has an excellent location on a peninsula into the water on the outskirts of Old San Juan. You are only about a 10 minute ride from the cruise ships and Old San Juan. If you are looking for a lot of nightlife and shopping outside your door this is not the place for you. The nicest part of the hotel is the beach and pool area. The beach is on its own cove, not much in the way of waves, but otherwise very nice. It has a great pool area and a nice area with hammocks and palm trees for shade. We are members of the Hilton Honors and were put on the club floor. The club floors have the use of a very nice lounge with free snacks drinks, newspapers and computer. For $115 per night this was a great deal. We were originally booked at the Marriott for the stay on the return from the cruise, but at $350 a night for the Marriott and $155 for the Hilton it was a no brainer. If you are going to pay $350 a night I would consider the El San Juan or the Marriott, but with the discount rates on the Hilton it is well worth it. My only complaint was that it does not have a casino, so you need to get a cab to go to a casino or to go to other restaurants. We ate at the Morton's on a great web promotion, 2 excellent meals for $99, but the other hotel restaurants looked very overpriced. They do have a Starbucks in the lobby.

<Content>No Mas Rooms We made reservations in December for our visit in March and recieved a hotel confirmation number from the agent. When we arrived they had our reservation for one night in January and not the 6 nights we reserved in March. We did get a room for one night. The concigre hooked us up with the Court Yard by Marriot by the airport, much nicer place, friendlier staff and better pricing. All we got at the Caribe was a total run around from the so called Manager Nelson, it was a disgrace. No way Jose' I would EVER go back. Hasta.

<Content>Good for young children...BUT..... PROS: *This hotel is great for children...there are many daily activities including a play ground, basketball, tennis, feeding fish at the peir, arts and crafts, gameroom, large pool and kiddie pool with floats and noodles offered, small man-made beach with no waves, slide in beach water, paddle boats/kayaks. *There are many shops with unique clothing, art, jewlrey, gifts, etc...There is a Starbucks located in the lobby.  *Good Pina Coladas...they were actually originated there. *Located 5 minutes from Old San Juan. Taxis are always available and costs about $10 per trip. *Grounds are beautiful...large pool, pond with swans and ducks, nice ocean views and city views, small old fort located on property. *Executive levels in the main building and the towers offered a continental breakfast (which included cereal, fruit, pastries, oj, coffee). CONS: *The rooms stink...literally. We walked in and we were welcomed with a strong scent of mildew...Yuck!!! Oh, the things we can't see...scarey. *The Service is the pitts!!! When checking in the front desk told us that we were receiving a renovated room with a beautiful ocean view. Upon arriving our room, we saw that what we received was a worn stinky room facing a concrete building being constructed. When we called about it...Oops! Sorry, all the sudden there are no other ocean view rooms available. Also, when checking out, there were charges on our room that did not belong to us. The staff was kind and never rude...but they did not go out of their way to help. *Service is very SLOW! Our room was not cleaned until 5 PM! When calling downstairs, you are either put on hold indefinitely or there is never an answer at all. Also, valet took a long time retrieving car...sometimes we felt like it would have been easier/faster to just get it ourselves. One morning during breakfast, they ran out of milk at 8:30 AM and said they could not get anymore for a while. More milk appeared about 45 minutes later. (In defense to this...the hotel is very large with many people to please, so I assume that it takes longer to respond and serve.) *Parking costs $20 per day!  *There is always activity and noise going on...not a quiet place if that is what you are hoping for. Many small children running, screaming, crying...it is a positive to us to watch all the children at play, but the noise can be a bit much. *Hotel food and drinks are expensive!!All in all, our kids seemed to enjoy all the activites the hotel offered...but due to the lack of service and the rooms we would most likely not stay here again.

<Content>Disappointed with the Hilton Caribe I was pretty underwhelmed with this hotel. The pictures looked gorgeous and I was expecting a certain standard from a Hilton Hotel. Unfortunately I did not get it.We arrived at to be greeted a very snotty and downright unfriendly receptionist who rambled off the instructions to our room while rolling her eyes.The room was big and much to our surprise had a cute little kitchenette. It also had construction directly across from our balcony. Although I didn't expect to spend much time in the actual room (this is a tropical paradise after all) the never-ending jackhammer noise started to get annoying. The pool was nice with plenty of pool chairs. The drinks were stiff but expensive. The food selection in the 8 restaurants on the premises was bland, boring, and over-priced.I guess the crux of my disdain for the hotel when we called THREE times for a blanket within over the course of an hour. I won't be staying at the Hilton again.

<Content>Presidents week @ Caribe Hilton We stayed at the Caribe for our school break this year. We traveled with 3 families with kids 10-16. 10 of us all together.We have traveled every Feb break for the last 10 years. That being said my review of the Caribe Hilton is great. The biggest problem we encountered was the wind and that had nothing to do with the hotel.Our check in was quick and painless, the only glitch was that we were all not on the same floor. We did not get crazy but asked if they could move the one family and it was done the next morning. Our reservations were for the executive level. It was worth the extra money for breakfast in the morning it had something for everyone, snacks and sodas(including water) during the day and cocktail hour at night(although they now offer a cash bar where in the past it was free). We even made it a point to be back to the hotel so we could get a cookie before bed!T hey just installed a new system to get to the executive room floors(8-10) you need to slide your room key in order to push your floor button and it did not always happen on the first try and we took a few rides up and down till we heard the BEEP and knew we were going to our floor.Our rooms were fine and I thought the bed was comfy. Like I said we have been going away for the last ten years and we have slept in some really bad beds.The pool area was clean and although this was a peak break time and the hotel seemed to be busy we never seemed to have a problem getting a bunch of chairs together. It is not like we had to get out there at 6AM. We had breakfast and got out there around 9:30 The water was a bit cool for me but the kids all got in and played around.The beach area was fine. If you are looking for waves dont look here. The beach is great for little ones. Again we never had a problem getting chairs there either. Maybe we would have to walk down the beach. But we could always get a seat.They have a list of activities down by the beach they seem to have lots of things planed for the little ones. I did see a yoga class one day and a bunch of people playing bingo another.They have a volleyball net but it is in the grass( a big disappointment for our group) but like I said it was also very windy so it would not have been fun to play anyway. We never had a problem getting a towel. Sometimes they took your room number and sometimes they did not. I am not sure how they decided what system they were using. They had basketballs that you could sign out.  This trip has been planned since last june. In Jan I saw on the TA forum about a food a beverage credit through go to PR.com I called my travel agent. Our trip fit all of the criteria including the hotel. So we were given a 250.00 FB credit to each of our rooms. That took the sting out of eating at the pool bar for lunch. We just sent the kids each day over to order lunch. We ate 3 lunches and one dinner(at the restaurant near the pool) plus a few cocktails and we each only went over the 250 by 40 dollars. Not bad. One day the dads went to subway and brought it back for us. It also helped that we brought down waters with us from the executive lounge.We took the bus(.50cents) each way exact change per person to old San juan on two evenings and had dinner and a walk about. We did take cabs back. They were ten dollars each cab. I have to mention that the buses do not run like in Cancun you will have to wait up to 20 min. It was deffinaly worth it because we could move all 10 of us for 5.00 compared to the 20 or 30 dollars for the cabs each way We walked into Condado for dinner but we took a cab back.We rented a van from target(not related to the stores) and took a tour of El Yunke and then spent the day at Luguillo beach. The beach was beautiful and you can rent chairs and umbrella right there(5.00 and 10.00 respectively). We booked a snorkle adventure through the tour desk for one day.I would deffintaly reccomend this hotel to a friend and we look foward to visiting Puerto Rico again in the future.

<Content>Yikes! Very Expensive Stayed in 3 hotels during my 10 day stay in San Juan, 6 nights at the Caribe. Staff were very nice, no problem there. Pool was OK but too cold for my comfort. There were only a handful of people ever in the pool. Small beach area that I didn't swim in. Lots of lounge chairs available. Our room had a small balcony that overlooked the pool and ocean, which was nice. The room was clean, but tired. A couple mornings I couldn't get hot water for a shower, just luke warm. The walls are very thin; I could constantly hear the neighbor's TV and even their conversations. The hallways smelled musty and moldy and only one elevator was working which was a real pain. I took the stairs a couple of times and they were pretty dirty and I ended up outside where there was no re-entry. I am not a Morton's type of person but we ate there once. No one should charge that kind of money for just OK food.; any food for that matter.The Italian restaurant was OK, but pricey as well. My husband said the Tapa's restaurant was pretty bad. Drink prices at the bar were outrageous. The proximity to Old San Juan is walkable, but a long hot walk with nice sidewalks to walk on. I don't mind the walk, but I really like walking. Others may opt to take the bus for 50 cents, which we did; make sure you have exact change. Never took a cab. I was at the hotel on my husband's company's dime so it may not be fair to complain, just trying to be real. I think all the area hotels are pricey, so the Caribe is probably in line, but it seemed way over the top to me. The location is a great asset so if you want an OK place with a nice pool and easy access to Old San Juan, I'd recommend it. But bring a big fat wallet!

<Content>Great Place to Stay in San Juan This is an excellent resort. Plenty to do for everyone; great drinks in the lobby bar; interesting choice of restaurants (nothing inexpensive, though!), and a well-organized, well-managed property. Towers room we stayed in appeared to have been recently renovated. Comfortable beds, nice bathroom, appealing decor. Too bad that whole stretch of resorts in San Juan isn't on a nice, sandy beach--but lots of options for having fun.

<Content>What has happened? It's amazing that we were at the hotel the same time as a couple other reviewers. We have stayed at this hotel 4 times previously and are Hilton Honors members. Every person we met had the same bad experience we did-- I can't believe the positive reviews for the same period are true.We did get great service from the front desk and from the Hilton Honors Club staff and concierge. The rest of the staff -- and we addressed this personally with the hotel manager -- displayed an almost unbelievable lack of ambition and friendliness.We waited an hour in the bar for a drink. When the waitress came we told her there were others in the bar who also had not been served, including a handicapped patron. She said she was the only server working in the bar.In the main restaurant, we had absolutely the laziest waiter I've ever met. Our meal took two hours and there were guests at only two other tables. Everything about him was slow -- he lumbered by after an hour to take our order and then came back an hour later with the bill. We discussed this with the restaurant manager.We were at the hotel 4 days and went to the pool each day. Not once were we approached by someone asking if we'd like a drink or something to eat. Don't these people exist on tips?We reported everyday, starting the first day, that our ac did not work. The rude manager we met the last day said we shouldn't have waited until the last day to report it. Doesn't he had a record of the work requests? He was absolutely horrid -- rude and lazy.I was shocked. We had never experienced this before. A staff member did tell us management had changed. This hotel has been a favorite of ours in the past and we looked very forward to our time there.But, we stayed one night at the newly re-opened La Concha and have to say that when we return to San Juan, that will be our first choice. It's part of Marriott and we belong to that points program as well. We were so turned off by the Hilton, we will probably start staying at mostly Marriott properties.What has happened in San Juan? Don't the folks there realize US economists are projecting bad times ahead and those tourist dollars will shrink? Locals might be wishing not so long from now that they hadn't been so lazy in the past.

<Content>a beautiful location The Hilton Caribe is located along a beautiful Atlantic beach in Puerto Rico. While everything there is very nice...the hotel itself is a little older than we expected. Everyone we encountered there, the waitstaff at the restaurants, the bartenders, the tourist representatives, the desk clerks, and the valet workers, was extremely courteous, friendly and helpful. The food at each restaurant was delicious and fresh...a pleasant experience overall. If we so desired, we could have remained at the hotel the entire trip and had everything we needed or wanted. But, we ventured out to the city and the rainforest...great daytrips for the adventurous.

<Content>Solid Choice My husband and I were trying to decide between this hotel and the El San Juan. We picked the Caribe only because the reviews about bed bugs at the ESJ freaked us out. We visited the ESJ and the Ritz for dinner and some gambling while we were there, so here are my thoughts about our decision. The lobby of the Caribe looks like a typical Hilton--it's clean and spacious but nothing spectacular. We were there from Sunday night-Wednesday night and never saw a crowd at the bar. One night there was quite decent music, though. A frequent business guest told us that the place gets crowded on Thursdays when there's a good band, but...The El San Juan's lobby is very ornate and was very busy when we were there on a Tuesday night. With several busy bar areas, the hotel felt much more social and festive. On the other hand, the large number of people could well have been a turn-off--there were what can only be described as packs of young teenagers wandering around looking for something to do, and one or two clumps of obnoxious Americans. It was not restful, but it was a lot of fun. The tiny lobby of the Ritz was 100% deserted at 11 PM. The lobby bar appeared to be closed.As for the pools, the Caribe's pool looks beautiful as you approach it from the lobby, but from anywhere else in the pool area, it's not particularly stunning. It was sometimes hard to find seats even though it wasn't busy. It was always very clean, though, and there was never a crowd at the bar or restaurant, so service was fast and friendly. The beach is the only private one in the San Juan area, so it felt very safe for small families, but it was very small and you certainly couldn't take a walk down the beach. The pool at the El San Juan really impressed us. We sort of wished we were staying there, with the oversized loungers, umbrellas, and multiple pool-side areas. It looked very glamorous, but we weren't there during the day.The pool at the Ritz was gorgeous, with stone lions spouting water, but it had the same kind of seats as the Hilton.Our room at the Hilton was also quite typical--clean, spacious, and newly renovated. There was a small bar area and a desk in the room. The bathroom didn't have a tub--it had a beautiful shower. Nothing spectacular, but quite nice. Some thoughts about staying at the Hilton: It has easier access to Old San Juan than the other hotels, and we spent almost every night there. Cab rides to town cost $10-$14, and to Isla Verde (the Ritz or ESJ) from the Hilton cost up to $20. The ride into town was well worth it. At the hotel, the food is very expensive, even for resort standards. $8 beers and $15 mudslides get a little ridiculous. None of the restaurants at the Caribe offered reasonably priced food, and we never bothered eating at any of them. Advice: use the Hilton Honors Executive Lounge for breakfast, enjoy lunch at the hotel or hit Subway, and take advantage of the convenience store for sodas, snacks, and even some drinks (pass the tapas bar, turn right toward the Subway on the corner). Definitely go into Old San Juan at night. We took the tour to the rainforest with the extended hike to the waterfall and really liked it. Our tour guide (Yogi) was so good that random people from other tours kept trying to join us. He talked the whole time but was incredibly interesting and covered a lot of different kinds of information. If they'll tell you, try to find out when he's the guide. He's worth it. Overall, with the proximity to Old San Juan, the private beach, and the VERY friendly staff, the Caribe was a good option for us. We would try the El San Juan next time if we don't hear about any more bugs, but we might regret moving farther from town.On Old San Juan: There are basically two main areas--Calle Fortaleza that's quite trendy with Dragon Fly (very good!) and the sister restaurants; and Calle San Sebastian that's supposedly more bohemian. With so many places to choose from, it was much more fun to go there for the night than to eat in the hotel. Food wasn't necessarily inexpensive, but at least we got to browse the different vibes and go bar hopping a bit. The first night we really planned, but then we just went into town and walked around until we found something we liked. We ate later (around 8-8:30) and sometimes had to wait 20 minutes for a table. Earlier in the evening seemed more crowded with families for dinner. If places will take a reservation, get the concierge to make one for you before you head over. If they don't, don't worry. Our favorite places in Old San Juan were Ostra Cosa for dinner and Nuyorican Cafe for music and dancing. Ask the concierge. All of the restaurants had very slow service, but we weren't in a hurry. Dragon Fly was very good all-round and is fun and funky inside. Baru had great menu items but the food wasn't that well cooked. Their mojitos were good, so we wished we had gone back to Ostra Cosa and just had drinks at Baru. We also ate at the Italian place in the ESJ, which wasn't great. The service was earnest and friendly, and the decor was elegant, but the food was mediocre. Overall, there were a lot of places with personality, which was fun.

<Content>Great and very relaxing We recently spent four nights at the Caribe Hilton (Feb 17 to 21, 2008). It was fantastic. The room was large, clean, and comfortable with a great view over the ocean and the nearby Hotel Normandie. The fancy drinks were good. If you don't want to spend a lot on food, there is a Puerto Rican sandwich-breakfast store across the street, and a subway next to that. The bus to Old San Juan is 75 cents (change only, no dollars) and takes about 10 minutes. The walk to Condado is about 20 minutes. The package we got from Hilton was about $2000 for round trip airfare from DC and 4 nights at the hotel. If we had waited until the last minute we could have gotten it for about $1500 or $1600.The Hotel offered a trip to the rain forest for $53 per person that took six hours and was lots of fun. A very entertaining tour guide named Yogi took us. Stopped at at little Puerto Rican greasy food place (as Yogi called it) that was good, and cheap.If you are a Hilton Honors member (or maybe even if you aren't) you can have a complimentary continental breakfast on the 2d floor of the Hilton Honors Tower that is good.

<Content>wonderful resort hotel This has to be the best hotel in San Juan in terms of overall vacation experience. The hotel has a nice private beach with a protected swimming cove, great workout area, nice pools, several good restaurants, attractive common areas and incredible views.The hotel is located 5 minutes from old San Juan, 5 minutes from Candado and 10-15 from Isla Verde and the airport, so it's easy to get anywhere. Most cab rides were $10-12 with Isla Verde and the airport coming in at $19-20.I read some reviews complaining about the food prices and room quality. While there were definitely some cosmetic problems with the room, I don't understand the negativity. Overall it was a nice room with a flat panel, huge shower and plenty of storage. And who cares about the room really? I'm sure the Ritz has much nicer rooms, but their beach is public and is nowhere near as nice as the Hilton's.As for the food prices, yes they are pretty steep. But my wife and I went to dinner at a lot of different hotels and I can tell you that $9 for a pina colada isn't so steep when compared to $14 for the same drink down the road. My advice: Make sure that you budget more for food/drinks than you expect.My other advise is to bring plenty of sunscreen. If you run out and have to buy it at the sundries shop, those pina coladas will start looking really cheap.We'll be going back to this hotel--probably next time with the kids.

<Content>Decent Room, Overpriced Food, Nice Pool This was my second visit to the Caribe. My first, before TripAdvisor existed, ended rather abruptly when an explosion and fire knocked out the power system and the staff handled the situation very poorly. I only came back this time because of a conference held at the hotel.My room, in the old main building, was renovated compared to my last visit, but the finishes were off a bit , mostly in the bathroom -- rusty shower head, cheap bathroom door, sloppy paint job. Still, my oceanview room was not bad overall and the bed was very comfy. The bathrooms have Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries. The TV carried the major networks' NYC affiliates, which was good for me. The Internet service was out half the time I was there. I brought a broadband card for my computer. I'm glad I did. Besides the spotty Internet service, I felt the $14.95 a day charge for it was ridiculous. Don't forget your cell phone, or you'll pay an arm and a leg for the phone service.Since the Caribe charges a 15 percent resort fee per day -- yes, that's 15 percent, not $15 -- the Internet service should have been included. What that 15 percent (which adds up when your room is $220 a night, a reduced conference rate) gets you are towels and a lounge chair on the beach or at the pool, and the use of the fitness center, which has seen better days and is in severe need of a renovation. I did not use the spa and the spa restaurant (more of a food bar) was closed when I went there. Dinner for one at Morton's came to more than $100, and could have been much more. I stayed away from the other restaurants at the hotel and satisfied myself with coffee and a danish from Starbucks in the morning. Conference meals were pretty good. For lunch, I took the public bus (Route 1, just a five minute walk from the hotel and only 50 cents each way) into old San Juan. Try the courtyard restaurant at the Hotel El Convento for a tasty and relatively inexpensive meal in a nice setting.The beach is actually a lagoon, nice, but beware of rocky areas. There is a man-made reef that keeps the big waves out, but a strong off-shore breeze brought some waves in despite the break, which I liked. On some days the water was clear. On others, debris washed in. The pool was very nice. There is now a small additional pool near the conference rooms, for use by guests in the newer tower.Housekeeping was good some days and forgetful on others, not leaving wash cloths or refills of shampoo or bath gel. The staff was generally friendly. Upon check-in, they tell you they will add $1 a day for a charity they support unless you say no. They forgot to add that fee, but put on others, including a porterage fee and a housekeeping fee that the hotel insisted be paid by our conference attendees. Since I carried my own bag, the porterage fee really irked me, especially since nothing was said about this fee in advance. I saw it on my bill the morning I checked out and they refused to remove it when I complained. There is a staff person just outside the doors or ramp leading to the beach and pool to keep non-hotel guests out, but I guess I looked the part and was never asked to show my room key or the card that must be shown when charging food to your room.I did not go to the casinos, but they are a short walk away in hotels along the Condado. There is also a casino in the Sheraton (formerly a Wyndham) near the bus and ferry terminals in Old San Juan. There are plenty of shops in Old San Juan. Be aware there is a 5.5 percent sales tax on clothing.I doubt I will stay here again. I've been to Puerto Rico many times and each hotel in San Juan or Dorado had its flaws. The nicest place at which I stayed was actually a wonderful guest house on the island of Vieques off the west coast of the main island, reachable by ferry from Fajardo or plane from San Juan. It's called Casa LaLanchita and owned by a family from New York State named McHoul. It is a beautiful facility on the ocean and their hospitality is unmatched. One problem, though. It's become so popular, it is usually booked solid during the season.

<Content>Over-priced but Efficient My wife and I have just returned from a week's stay at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan PR , paying a convention rate which still was quite expensive. Every additional item was charged and the restaurants' meals  drinks were extortionate - so thanks to previous travellers who suggested the convenient Subway on the corner nearby. It is often worthwhile getting a cab into Old San Juan ($10 to $11 each way) to sample the numerous restaurants there and the vibrant street scene (a festival on the Sunday celebrating San Sebastian and noisy Birthday celebrations).The room was comfortable and the front desk did move us at our request due to the dull view across a cigarette butt strewn roof we had from the third floor room initially allocated. One bright spot was the pride in his job shown by Augustus who took care of the pool area near the tropical gardens. It was kept absolutely pristine and it was clear how much he cared for the area and the hotel guests who used it.

<Content>Wonderfull!!! I had to write a review as we were almost scared off of this hotel by what others had written.We loved it! We had a great room with amazing views (1565). It must have been newly remodeled and it was extremely nice. Very clean, comfortable and the shower.....amazing! The beds were incredibly comfortable.Everyone working at the hotel was wonderful and polite. The pool and ocean (beach) setting were wonderful and allowed you to sit at the pool and then swim in the ocean which was just as close as the pool. The pool was very clean which I am not sure how with the ocean and sand so close.Also, when we were there, there weren't many children since it wasn't anyones break, but the kids there were VERY well behaved and enjoyable to be around. No screaming Mom and Dads at tired little ones.We were there with a conference and every one of us (6 couples)had a great experiences. Even those with older rooms had no problem.Only issue would be that you couldn't charge the things in the stores to your room. That would have been nice instead of going back to your room to get money.We want to go back with the kids sometime!

<Content>Average Hotel The Caribe Hilton is pretty average and like any other hotel. It is very touristy. There are a ton of Americans that stay there along with a Starbucks and a Morton's Steakhouse so don't expect to get a local experience by staying here. The pool is full of children so I would not recommend this place for a romantic get away. The gym is very small although the staff there were very helpful and able to recommend scenic routes to jog along the beach. On a positive note, the walk to Old San Juan takes about 25 minutes (about 2 miles). There is a beautiful park on the way and it is great to wander into town if you walk along the beach. On the whole, the Hilton is a clean place to stay, but don't expect to experience Puerto Rico at this hotel.

<Content>Decent Hilton I stayed at the Hilton Caribe on business. Would not recommend for families. You would be much better off staying at the Southern side of the PR. My understanding is the resorts are much nicer - including the Hilton Resort property.The Hilton is ok - says it has been renovated. I am a frequent business traveler so my standards are very high. The rooms were fine - they were clean, nice tv, etc. I stayed on the Executive floor - so I had acccess to the Executive Lounge - was a nice upgrade.The biggest issue I saw with the resort was the lack of a real beach. There is a small beach but it can get really crowded.This would be a fine place to stay if you were there for one night but I would not want to have my family there for the week.The staff was great and very pleasant.

<Content>Good Experience I am a Hilton Diamond HHonors member, so stay at Hilton whenever I can. Caribe Hilton is one of the first Hilton's in the chain, built in 1947, and continually upgraded. It probably needs it again. Our room, on the Ocean, was, as was mentioned by others, not available until 4PM, which is the guaranteed check-in time. From 2PM until 4PM, I was told our room would be avaiable in 20 Minutes. This occured 4 times. We were finally given an alternate room, which did not have as good a view as originally ordered, but was OK. Room was clean, and the new Hilton comfort bed sheets were very nice. Bed was very comfortable. Service was very nice, and the beach was awesome! The poolside food was vertually inedible, soggiy cold sandwiches, and watered drinks. Having said that, I would go back. but please see my review of the Condado Plaza.

<Content>Weather Fantastic We traveled to the Caribe Hilton 12/27/07 to 1/2/08. Waited as expected until 4 PM to receive our rooms, however hotel did make it easy to store luggage so that grounds and pools (changing rooms available) could be explored. Received connecting rooms which was nice we were travelling with our two children in their early twenties. View was only fair could see water, pools etc by but hotel lower roof interferred with the view. Rooms were fine, beds were very comfortable. Hotel restaurants are extremely pricey. Service at Olas Health restaurant was outrageously slow. Quick lunch or breakfast alternative was the Starbucks (sandwiches  salads) or the Subway at the end of the drive. Small cafeteria at the end of the drive was closed for the holidays. Was extremely impressed with what the hotel had to offer for families with young children however might recommend Isla Verde area for families with teens or twenties. Cab ride to old San Juan was reasonable. El Morro and Bacardi tour, and Paseo de Princessa were worth the time. I was disappointed in rainforest tour as no birds or critters of any type were visible. Parrot Club in Old San Juan was excellent, also La Bombonera for breakfast. Had an enjoyable New Year's Eve at Senor Frogs.

<Content>Don't Believe Bad Reviews....This Hotel is Great!!!! This hotel is a true resort on beautiful island (Puerto Rico). I would not believe the bad reviews. This hotel was great. I was at the hotel over winter break and the hotel was happening. The pools are great, service is great, and the hotel property is great. I would say that if you could get a rate below 250 it is definitely worth it. The location is a okay at best, but it is no big deal. There is a subway sandwich shop on the property and a convenience store too. Cabs are expensive in San Juan and based on zone. A 4 minute cab to old san juan is 11 dollars and Condanado is 15 ( I walked to Condanado in about 10 minutes) and don't even bother going to Isla Verde for 19 dollars. I had access to the Executive Lounge which was great. I recommend going to the lounge on floor 9 of the main building instead of going to the lounge in the Hhonors tower. They have fridges full of water and all types of pop that are free all day. I took the drinks and put them in the fridge that is in the room. I wasn't with little kids, but it is a fantastic hotel for kids. Plenty of shallow water in the pool area and the beach is protected by rocks, which limits the high waves that most of san juan sees. The beach is fantastic, not many waves, but a nice little stretch (especially compared to other hotels in San Juan). The rooms are a little above standard, but not extremely fancy. I went to the Old San Juan Hotel and Ritz and was not impressed. Those hotels are for people who want to tell people that I stayed at the Ritz or I stayed at the InterContinental. Lunch by the pool and drinks are expensive, but what do you expect, its a hilton not a Motel 6. I am not a little kid, but the coolest thing at the hotel is the fish feeding pier. They give you bread to throw in the ocean, and you get to see many different types of fish (size and color) without having to go snorkeling or scuba diving. I did not use the spa, but it did look nice (but expensive...what do you expect). The workout facility in the Spa (which if free for guests) is fantastic and overlooks the ocean. So the moral of the story...don't believe the bad reviews and if you get a good rate don't hesitate to book it. The hotel doesn't have a casino, but the candanado hotel which is about a 10 minute walk and the Marriot which is about 15 minute walk have casinos (I'd go to the Marriott...I won Big). Keep in mind this is San Juan not Las Vegas. A couple restaurants that I definitely recommend: Parrot Club (Old San Juan/Local Cuisine/Average entree 20-30), Dragon Fly (Old San Juan/Fusion between Asian and Latino Cuisine). I could write another couple pages, but I hope you get the point. This property is fantastic...if you get a good rate book it and don't worry about the bad reviews. Keep in mind most people only review a hotel when they have a great time or a terrible experience. As you could tell, I had a great time and can't wait to go back.P.S. Don't freak out about the weather forecast before you go. I checked weather.com and it said rain for the whole week I was down there and it was sunny 99% of the time. I think they just predict rain at 50% everyday so they wont be wrong.

<Content>Okay, nothing spactacular This hotel is okay, even though it's overpiced. If your going to stay in that area you might as well stay in one of the cheaper hotels along the Cornado. The beach isn't nice we had to catch a taxi 20min away to go swiming. And the food is seriously over-priced in the resturants-Subway became our friend for a couple of nights :) Definately not the spot for singles or young adults traveling, good place for families and older folks.It was a clean place to sleep...

<Content>I still like this hotel I still like this hotel. We stayed for 3 days, thru New Years Eve, in the garden towers and had a very nice room. There was a lot going on in the hotel but the staff found time to be attentive. One member of our party stayed in the adjacent Normandy and thought it was terrific. I am disappointed about the lack of interesting stores one would expect to see surrounding big hotels. If you want to walk in the neighborhood there's not much to see but then old San Juan is very close. Everytime I visit this city I like it more and more.

<Content>Great for kids, but in need of some remodel I cannot imagine a better hotel to travel to with kids. The pool area, the private beach, the games to borrow, the activities, bouncy things, fish to feed, etc. etc. This place is just beautiful beyond words. That being said, there are different types of accomodations in this massive resort, and the rate you pay and your Hilton HHonors status do seem to dictate the type of accomodation you get. We stayed in Room 515 in December 2007 for our fourth stay at the property. 515 is in the older, main part of the hotel. There are at least 3 other sections -- the Towers, the Garden Suites, and the Lagoon Villas. We have stayed only in the Towers and the main building. The main building the last 2 times we've stayed, has been in need of some remodeling. The grout around the tile and tub was cracked and black, and the tub did not turn off all the way. The wooden bathroom door and trim were starting to deteriorate from the moisture. And the tile in the bathroom was a pale mauve circa 1958, I'd guess. But everything in the room worked. The bathroom ventilation is a bit odd because you can hear people talking through it as if they were in your bathroom, but you can hear it only when you are in the bathroom. The bottom of the tub in 515 was also starting to separate from the floor, which gave a feeling of standing on a waterbed when in the bathroom. So, the room wasn't great. But we didn't really care. The tower rooms are newer and in our experience are in better condition. A tip -- book online at the Hilton website and check into the bounceback rate. It includes a huge buffet breakfast, which normally costs over $20.00 per person.

<Content>Please Don"T Stay Here! Please listen to this review. We booked this hotel with our HH we had saved up. BIG MISTAKE! The 4th room we were shown was finally when we gave up at finding a nice room. Should I start with the overflowwing toilet in the 1st of the Tower rooms we were shown? Or possibly the must and mildew smell in every one of the 4? My husband and I want to save you the pain of staying at this hotel. If anyone has questions you can email me at [-]

<Content>we made the right choice! I just returned from a family vacation at the Caribe Hilton. I feel obligated to write a review, as I poured over the prior trip advisor reviews so intently as I evaluated where we should stay. This was a wonderful choice! The beach, pool area and grounds of this property are beautiful. The hotel itself is very pretty, and seemed to be well maintained. Other reviews had noted differences between more recently updated rooms, I heard and saw nothing of it. The staff was very accomodating and pleasant. We traveled with other families with teenagers, and I will note, that there is a lack of night-life here. We did take cabs to Isle Verde, Old San Juan and Condado for dinner and gambling. The trade off for staying at the Caribe and venturing out in the evenings is well worth it. The other hotels did not compare. The Caribe was by far the best choice.

<Content>Don't waste your time or money on this place! We booked an oceanview studio villa at the Caribe Hilton for three nights (Dec. 27-30) 10 months in advance considering this is a popular travel time and we wanted to make sure we had a nice room. When we arrived they checked us in and made no mention of any changes to our stay, but when we got to our room it was not an oceanview at all and it was nothing more than a standard hotel room that did not at all resemble a villa. The view was of the building under construction next door and and there was not even a peek of the ocean. We immediately called downstairs and informed them that this was not the type of room we had reserved and the front desk offered no explanation as to why they had given us this room, they simply said they would have to call us back. Well, 15 minutes later we got a call back and they offered a reduction of $100/night and the possibility of moving us to an oceanview, but we would have to wait until 4:00pm the next day to see if there would be one available. Considering we were paying over $500/night for nothing more than a cramped and worn standard room overlooking construction and the parking garage we turned down their offer and asked to speak to the hotel manager. He did return our call about 20 minutes later and proceeded to tell us that the computer showed that we had not booked an oceanview room. We informed him that we had our confirmation with us and we would be happy to show it to him. At this time, he cut the rate in half (still overpriced as we checked on the hotel website and it showed they had oceanview rooms available in the main hotel for the same price!!). I should also mention that my husband is Hilton Honors Gold, so I would have expected a little more effort up front to remedy the situation. To top it all off, the manager on duty in the villa tower was rude when we later went downstairs and asked that the rest of our reservation be cancelled because we were going back to the Hampton Inn  Suites next to the airport (great staff and beautiful rooms) where we had stayed the previous three nights.

<Content>Far surpassed my expectations I was a bit nervous about the Caribe due to the mixed reviews, but it was wonderful. We are a family with two teenagers, travelled with two other families. Everyone had a great time, mostly because of the fabulous property with real resort feel, the friendly staff, and the activities. The pool and beach area were very spread out and inviting, as was the lobby. We all enjoyed activities such as bingo and volleyball, but mostly relaxed by the pool and enjoyed the beautiful ocean views. The only negative aspectof the hotel was the lack of casino and somewhat remote location. This was not a big deal as we took a short taxi ride each night to check out restaurants, hotels, and casinos that were all very nearby. Although the condado and isle verde hotels were more hopping at night, we felt that the resort feel at caribe made it more relaxing and welcoming to families. We did not eat in any of the restaurants other than the breakfast buffet which was great. We also took advantage of the towers snacks in the afternoon which was perfect for after pool and before late dinner. There is a bodega steps from the hotel for snacks, etc, and also a subway, which was fine for the kids for one lunch. We did stay in towers rooms which were very nice, newly renovated for sure, great bathroom, but small rooms. It was fine b/c we didn't spend too much time in room at all. I did take a quick look at one of the regular rooms, and it looked fine as well. Overall, we had a great time and would definitely return to the caribe hilton.

<Content>Pretty good pre-Christmas visit Four of us made a three night trip to the Caribe Hilton the week before Christmas (2007). This was our 4th family stay there (and Dad had had several business visits in addition). Last year we were particularly impressed by the Executive Level lounge, where we enjoyed unlimited alcoholic beverages each evening. The hors d'oevres and desserts/coffee were also free. This was a significant factor in our returning to the Caribe. However, unannounced the hotel has changed its policy. Now there is a cash bar - with a barman - for a couple of hours only each evening. (Actually, they won't take cash, only charges to your room). Admittedly, at $3 for wine and (I think) $4 for spirits it's still a good deal compared with other bars in the hotel. However, it was disappointing. Presumably the free bar was felt to be open to abuse, costing the hotel more than it was prepared to pay for the goodwill. The hotel has a stated policy of not allowing children under 14 into the Executive Lounge. They need to enforce this. Frequently, small children were allowed to run around; one we saw burned her fingers playing with the steam option on the expresso machine. We are not against small children, but this lounge is not a suitable place for them to play. We found the hotel rather quiet: other guests opined that aggressive competition from new super-resort hotels (eg the Conquistador) is hurting the Caribe (and the Normandie Hotel next door appeared almost empty, as judged by the paucity of lit rooms at night). We ran into a demonstration one morning against the villa development on Condado: apparently some of the new building, incl the Caribe's, has encroached on the protected Old Fort site. (We didn't expect to run into a political demo against our hotel!). Overall, our stay met our expectations. Very low key and relaxing. Things we'd like improved? The infinity pool that is the centerpiece of the hotel recreation area is colder than the ocean in December. How much would it cost the hotel to heat it up a bit for its guests, who are paying plenty for the privilege of swimming in cold water? They might actually recoup the cost in swim-up patrons to the pool bar! (currently, no one is brave enough to endure to cold water to sit on the pool side of the bar). Also, get rid of the guys posted at the entrance to the pool area who check to make sure only guests get through. We encountered several who insisted we go away and return with room keys. Especially when the hotel is quiet, this comes across as tacky and unfriendly. If they insist on doing this, give the guests colored wrist bands or similar, instead.

<Content>Arrived with low expectations, and left impressed. After reading the reviews on this site, I was extremely disappointed when I found out my friend arranged for us to stay at the Caribe Hilton. I arrived at the hotel with very low expectations, expecting a has been hotel with old, dirty rooms. To my surprise and delight, my stay at the Caribe was absolutely wonderful! While the hotel was not as polished as other hotels I have stayed in, what it lacked, it made up for in atmosphere. The hotel has a very carribbean/tropical feel as the hotel's buildings blend with the outdoors. In fact, the lobby and many parts of the hotel are partially outdoors. We booked one of the cheaper ones, but upon arrival asked to stay in the new, renovated Honors Towers that I'd read so much about. The towers feel like their own hotel as they have their own separate lobby/check-in area. The room was very, very nice for the price. Room was extremely clean, nicely furnished, with a large marble bathroom (with rain head shower). There was a balcony overlooking Old San Juan and a partial view of the beach and ocean. We were told they could only give us a city view, so we were pleasantly surprised. The room included a flat screen tv hanging on the wall, a desk, and an extra chair. There was also a small fridge. The room was of decent size, but I thought the closet was too small, even for only 2 people. We didn't pay for access to the executive lounge, but we were able to gain access since we were staying in the Honors Tower. We had a continental breakfast which consisted of a small selection of pastries, fruit, sandwiches, cereal, and drinks. What I loved about the hotel was how it blended with nature. The hotel grounds are large and nicely designed. Yes, it's true that the hotel grounds have seen better days (when we were there, they were in the process of building/updating the circular deck that jets out into the ocean), but honestly, the little bit of chipped paint, a few weeds, etc did not detract from the overall beauty of the hotel. When you step outside from the lobby and bar, the first thing you see is a little pond leading to a large pool, and then the ocean behind it. It looks as if you are just a step away from the ocean even when you are still in the lobby. Very picturesque. There is also a garden with a koi pond with lots of fish, some bridges, and a gazebo. I even saw a few swans in the water. There's another smaller pool by the garden as well. The man-made beach is clean, but somewhat small. However, we had no problems finding chaises, and there weren't that many people even on a weekend. Getting a drink on the beach was somewhat slow though. Our waiter took over 40 minutes to come back with our drinks. Other than that, since it's a man-made beach, the current is somewhat blocked off by the wall so the water is much calmer thant the beaches in Condado. Also, there is a hammock area, but I only saw 1 hammock. We didn't try any of the restaurants as we ate in Old San Juan, but the bar in the lobby was pretty good at night (lots of people). There is also a Starbucks in the lobby. The hotel's location isn't the greatest (far from San Juan, and other parts of the island), but it is very close to Old San Juan, which is about a 10-12 minute drive away (it's basically just down the street), and the main Condado area, which is literally a 3 minute drive away. Overall, I had a wonderful stay at the Caribe Hilton and would definitely come back if I'm in San Juan. I also had the pleasure of staying at the Marriott Stellaris in Condado and I can honestly say that while I loved the Marriott, I would choose the Caribe Hilton as it had a more resort feel, which I prefer.

<Content>Best stay ever I stayed there June 2007, Upon my arrival I was amazed at the beautiful grounds surrounding the hotel. The pool and beach area were astonishing, The rooms marvaly decorated and well aired. The view from the room was spectacular, to eat there are so many restaurants to choose from that I was never hungry. The staff was marvelous and well mannered. I cannot wait for my next stay. You cannot beat the price.

<Content>Nice hotel - bad food We stayed here over Thanksgiving and the scenery was wonderful - right on the ocean. The rooms were average in size in the Hilton Honors Tower (room 1659) Bathroom counters weren't kept clean but shower was. Although the hotel has seven resturants there wasn't alot of choices for breakfast or lunch. There are NO healthy food choices other than fruit. Very expensive for the buffet and lunch by the pool was just OK. Enjoyed our stay but not the food and do NOT go to the Subway across the street - old bread and a hair in my sandwich!

<Content>Did the trick... We just got back from a trip over Thanksgiving week. We had read a couple of the reviews, and I would say more-or-less that our experience was consistent with what the majority of people said, but we really liked the place.Room - we stayed on the executive floor  had an oceanfront room. The room itself was pretty new, very clean and overall we were pleased with it. Our only issue, which was a slight one, was that the oceanfront view overlooked the ocean but also overlooked the main entrance. It wasn't a big deal though as the view of the ocean  fort was pretty cool. Staying on the executive floor was worth it. They treated you pretty well and it was nice to have water  soft drinks whenever you it was open.Pool/Ocean - was very nice. There were plenty of chairs to choose from; the pool was clean; the ocean beach was private. All good things. The hot tub wasn't too hot though.Spa - we had the spa vacation, so it included all the spa had to offer. The spa itself was nothing to write home about (pretty bland), but the treatments were good  we were treated pretty well.Restaurants - Breakfasts - we had breakfast included in the spa vacation and the buffet was good. Decent selection  it seemed fresh. The knock would be that it was $23 per person, but if you are on a package that includes it, it doesn't matter  is worth it. Lunch - we ate everyday at the pool bar. The food was so-so at best and we never had great service. Dinner - we only ate at Morton's, and you really can't go wrong there. Beverages - all the beverages we had were very good, and we tried a fair amount, but they were a drop pricey. Not too bad as we've been places where they were worse, but at least they were good each time.Location - for us, this was a huge plus. We wanted to have a very relaxing vacation...and this was a great location for it. We went to visit a bunch of the other big hotels - and they are all right on top of each other with planes flying over them. This hotel was out of the main area, but very close to Old San Juan as well for a little sight seeing.One note - we booked the vacation on hilton.com. After booking I checked the site a few times to see what else was available. Each time, the price of the room dropped. We started out with just a breakfast package, but ended up with a Spa package on the executive floor for less $. Once we booked that, we still noticed the price dropped a few times. Each time, we called the hotel and they quickly adjusted our price.We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone else looking.

<Content>Go Somewhere Else (Especially With Children)! We thought the Villas would be perfect for our needs. The kitchen and separate rooms worked out fine; but, it was the basics that were neglected by this hotel. (Even if you don't have children read this message.) After calling twice, prior to arrival, to child proof the room (ie collect wires, etc), there were lamp, phone, clock wires everywhere--not even wound up. It made the room look sloppy and cheap. The rug was falling apart. We waited over three hours for a high chair that should have already been in the room. The crib was RUSTED AND CHIPPING PAINT!!! NONE of the three televisions had the basics: NO DVD player, NO on-demand movie service, NO basic movie channels (ie HBO, Showtime, etc). There was no honor-bar in any of the rooms. The fans were noisy. The shower doors were broken; causing water on the floor. The thermostats failed to work. THE SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE!!!!!! For the most part the staff was nice; but for the ones who chose to feign: No speak English. To top the time at the hotel off, on the last day we bought a slice of chocolate cake at the Starbucks only to learn, one bite into it already, that there was mold on the bottom side of the cake. GROSS!

<Content>Great pool/beach area What we liked about the hotel:The pool/beach area are very well kept and really nice (although, keep in mind that the beach isn't very wide). The hotel also has lots of games/toys for kids to play with (such as slides into the ocean, floaties, etc). The service is also fantastic -- everywhere, from the reception to the staff at the pool.What we didn't like about the hotel:We weren't at all impressed with the food (at the poolside bar and grill). On that note, there is a Starbucks onsite and a Subway and mini-mart (with snack food, drinks, etc) across the street from the hotel, which were convenient.The rooms really do need an upgrade. We had one room in the main wing, which was fairly run down (especially the bathroom). The other half of our group stayed in a room in the Honors tower -- that had clearly been upgraded and was a lot nicer.Spa:I got a massage at the spa. The massage itself was good, but I was unimpressed with the rest of the spa -- it was very bare bones and not at all luxurious (prices of services were on par with other spas I have been to) -- not quite the overall experience I had been looking forward to.Other:Location is pretty good -- a ten minute drive from Old San Juan. We were told that there is also a bus that you can take from outside the hotel to Old San Juan that is pretty convenient. And of course, there are lots of taxis. If you can get to it, eat at Old San Juan instead of the hotel; there are lots of really good/fun restaurants there.

<Content>loved the Hilton Caibe My wife and I stayed in the Honors Tower for the weekend on points and the stay was wonderful. The rooms were great and although we have a room that overlooked the ocean and the new construction, with the door closed you cannot hear anything. Due to the renovations the gardens are not working which I do like, but the service was great and the staff wa not in the way.

<Content>The food was good I went to P.R on labor day weekend with three girlfriends. We stayed at the Hilton which is near Old San Juan. We asked around, to friends/family, to get a nice place to stay and this was the hotel name that kept popping up. We also wanted to stay there because we heard they had a awesome seafood buffet, that included lobster, on Friday nights at a reasonable price. We had also heard that if you stay on the executive floor you get free continental breakfast and before dinner drinks(alcoholic) w/hors d'oeuvres. The person we, my friends and I, had talked to stayed there in Feb 07. We were planning our trip in June. We called the hotel to inquire how much more this would cost us  they informed us it would be an extra $60/person but they did not have any more rooms available w/that package. We then called our travel agent who called them and they did have those rooms available. We did not book them because she said it would be cheaper if when we went to ask to be upgraded and see if we could get it cheaper. We agreed.Day of arrival: We arrive at the airport and get a taxi. All of the taxi services are a certain price if you are traveling in the what is considered the tourist area so no matter how many people you have going to a location inside the tourist area it's one price, which isn't bad. It cost the three of us $20.50 to get to our hotel 15 minutes away. My other friend who came on a later flight, it cost her the same thing by herself. So we get to the hotel and are checking in and inquire about the executive suites. They inform us that they do not have those room available because they are being renovated. The seafood buffet is not available either because it was in the same location. We were heated because we had called a week ago and they said it was sold out! Althought they had restaurants on the grounds we had our minds set on seafood. We asked the concierge if there were another place to get a seafood buffet. He told us to get in a taxi and go to The Ritz Carleton. We go to the Ritz and although they did have a seafood buffet, it wasn't vast enough. It was the basics and no lobster. Our friend did tell us of an authentic spanish resteraunt to eat at once we were there and it is called El Jibarito in Old San Juan located at Calle Sol 280. You have to walk quite a way if you take the bus to Old San Juan, but the food was well worth it and the price could not be beat. That's another thing if you can take the bus wherever you can. The taxi rides take a toll on your pocketbooks after a while. The bus is .75 and the bus drivers speak english.We found that there really was nothing to do once there except go to Old San Juan and walk around. It's very nice with its cobblestone streets and the docking area where the cruise ships come in. There is also a Walgreens and Marshall's there and alot of knicknacks to be bought. We took the bus to the mall, which is like any other mall. We tried to get a taste of the nightlife, but there was none. A hotel person told us to go to a certain club in downtown, but it was burned down. A waste of cab fare--two ways! The Hilton is away from other hotels so if you want to be around something don't stay there. It's more of a family or lovers atmosphere. The rooms also smelled moldy. They said we had a room with a view. The only view we had was of the construction going on another part of the hotel. Other than that it was okay. I wouldn't go there for another girls night out, but I would go for a lover's weekend.

<Content>Not a great place for singles and adverturists! Ok...well, I choose this hotel based off of reviews that this hotel was fun and great and so on... and so on.... I took this trip by myself looking for a great week of rest, relaxation and a little bit of fun in between. Well, I definately got the rest and relaxation but I was missing a lot of the fun part. My room was beautiful with the most gorgeous marble/glass bathroom with a big ol' sexy shower, his and her sinks and a tinyitty bitty toilet pushed up in a corner behind the bathroom door! lol!! Other then the compromised space of the toilet, the bathroom was great, the room was a decent size and the bed was hell-a comfy!!! I had a room on a high floor overlooking the ocean and resort and let's not forget the dirty old building of the second hotel tower right smack in the middle of your view. And its nothing nice to look at. Trust me. I don't know whose bright idea it was to build a new tower of the hotel over looking the old one with teases of oceanview on your right and left sides. I feel sorry for the people that were below me on lower floors because I'm sure they got to experience more of the second tower then I did as they were not high enough to over look most of the building. So anyway, I had a spa package guys. The spa was great! I received a wonderful sweedish massage, manicure, pedicure and facial. But beware people...They charge tax for spa services. Now eventhough the spa services were included in my hotel price, I was still charged around $65 in taxes for the three days I was there. Definately caught me off guard.Now as far as dining and entertainment is concerned, they have a great little bar located in the lobby. Drinks are pricey but where are they not pricey? They have $3 beers during Happy Hour so make sure you rack up. There's also a swim up bar outside at the pool where you can order burgers and finger foods which are pretty tasty. That's only if you need a quick snack. I did not eat at Morton's Steak House because of the reviews that I read about the prices and quality. So for the most part, I ate in old San Juan a couple of times, therefore, I can't comment too much on the food at the hotel. I did receive complimentary buffet breakfast at the main hotel restaurant (sorry, I forgot the name) which was pretty good. You get omlets to order and an erray of breakfast treats. The pool and beach area are very nice with tons of places to set up lounge chairs. The beach is man made (what's with these resorts with man made beaches?) But if you're looking for a hotel with the watersports and outdoor activities, then this is not the place for you!! There's no casino, no water sports, no activites, nothing!! It kind of sucked! There was really nothing special about this hotel except for the over-priced food (which was nothing to brag about either when I did get a chance to eat there) and the hell-a comfy bed. If you want good food you're gonna have to take a $20 cab ride to Old San Juan. Aguasvivas was great! And word to the wise...... If you're gonna take a trip to the Bacardi Factory, call them first to make sure they are open. I was told by one of the travel agents at the hotel that the Bacardi factory was open 7 days a week eventhough the hotel only offered its tour on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday but you can take a 20 minute ride out there yourself and get a tour. SO.... that's what I did. I hopped in a cab and went over to the Bacardi Distillery just to find out that the place was closed!!! I paid $50 for a cab ride to nowhere!!!! Also, don't be fooled by the little boutiques at the hotel. If you walk right down the street there is a little bodega that sells souveniers for half the price. I racked up on those!! Overall, the hotel was nothing exciting. The people were pleasant, they all spoke English but it was like being in New York City with a tropical feel. Everyone is Amercianized. I even met a cab driver that used to live 5 minutes from me in New Jersey! Ha!! Great people though. But this hotel gets 2 thumbs down for activities, entertainment and night life.

<Content>Beautiful We stayed for three nights on one of the Executive floors. This was well worth the extra $ since breakfast, lunch and snacks were free all day, plus cocktails were discounted. The hotel provided a free internet connection with printer too.The view was spectacular from all rooms, as far as I could tell. The pool was gorgeous and the beach was nice too. The hotel has put in an artificial reef on the beach which kept the water calm and made for some great snorkeling.The health club was very good too. I didn't try the spa.The down side is that the hotel is quite isolated from everything else. When I was there, quite a bit of construction was going on, which made walking to Condado Beach impossible. Not really the fault of the hotel. But, there aren't any restaurants within walking distance, so you either have to grab a cab to get something to eat or pay the prices at the hotel, quite expensive! The food was good though, even at poolside.Go to Isla Verde beach. Old San Juan is a shopper's paradise, but as I'm not into shopping, I didn't really enjoy it so much. We did take the horse and buggy ride which was nice. My favorite part was the snorkeling - it was like swimming in a tropical fish tank. Our teenagers got bored after a awhile.

<Content>Loved the Caribe! Just returned from a wonderful trip to Puerto Rico. When I go back, I'll stay at the Caribe Hilton. The hotel is clean, staff is awesome and the beach is breath taking! I stayed in room 440 and the view from the balcony is amazing. The restaurants at the hotel are expensive (just like any other hotel...) but, a $10 cab ride will take you to Old San Juan where you can find an abundance of places to eat. Also, directly across from the Hilton is a Mini Mart where you can get sodas, beer, liquor for the fridge in your room. There is also a Subway across the street, on the corner that has a good breakfast. Housekeeping staff are awesome! Our remote didn't work when we got there. Called downstairs and no one ever showed up. Left a $2 tip for housekeeping the next day with a note remote not working. When we returned our remote was fixed. Tip housekeeping and they will take really good care of you. At the bar, Victor (afternoons) and Vivianne (nights) are the best! There is only music Thurs - Sunday. A $19 cab ride will take you to the San Juan Hotel which has really good music in the lobby and for the younger crowd, an awesome club. Saul at the pool bar is great. Be prepared for $9 mixed drinks. The bacon cheeseburger at the pool bar is $9 with fries but, can be compared to a burger at nice resturant here. There is not an abundance of waiters walking around the pool/beach area but, the pool bar is less than a 1 minute walk from where you are. Overall, the Hilton is great and I will stay there again when I return to Puerto Rico!

<Content>Overall very good After reading these reviews for a couple months I figured I should foward my opinions for others to view as well. I went down for our 5 year wedding anniversary along with our wedding party and families (5 families, 10 adults, 12 kids). After speaking with the reservation manager we were upgraded to an ocean view room in the towers at the Garden view room price - all 5 families! The pool and beach were great for the kids. The food is expensive but that is what you get at a resort that is not all-inclusive. We loaded the fridge with breakfast and snack food from the minimart across the street and went over in Condado for some nice local Puerto Rican food a few times. The walk across the bridge really isn't that far and we did it with a stroller a as well. No casino is a bummer but it was known ahead of time. There are no waves but that should be known if you have read up a little. Rooms were small but clean. The shower and the beds are great but I wish the beds were a little bigger being we needed the rooms with two beds versus one King. The ENTIRE staff was very nice to us. They do not move quick, but were helpful if it was with the stroller or getting a shuttle to San Juan. We booked a few excursions on our own and saved some money - the Bio Bay in Farjado is a must! If you do not want to Kayak it call Captain Suarez as he is the only one allowed in the bay with a boat. The Rainforrest is beautiful and you must make it to La Mina waterfall.Enjoy your time there!

<Content>You know, not so bad! Quite a bit of mixed reviews here. I am a long time Hilton customer and have stayed at many properties around the world. This was really not as bad as people make it out to be. Sure it is old but it is clean and there are people working all day long to keep it up and looking good. It could use some sprucing up but it was just fine for a long weekend or so. We were there 4 nights.Despite what others have said the beach is pretty darn nice. Clean, private and no, there are not rocks everywhere. We even saw a nice array of fish while snorkeling by the break rocks about 50 yards off shore.The pool is also very nice, even when crowded there is a chair to be found and plenty of space in the pool to relax.One thing that is true is that it is expensive to eat and drink here but why wouldn't you go off campus to Condado or OSJ to do that?Our room was nice with a large bathroom. I also understand some rooms have yet to be refurbished but they all will be in time. The people on staff were also as pleasant as they could be, except for one Concierge that had a bit of an attitude.All in all the place was just fine for a few day Caribbean getaway and I would go back. It is an old place that is kept up, keep that in mind and go enjoy!

<Content>Beautiful We stayed at the Caribe Hilton from August 12 to August 15. I did not pay for this trip so I can not complain about prices. Although I do know that many of the restaurants and drinks are pretty expensive. But delicious.Everyone was extremely helpful and to your service. No complaints. If you needed something they were there for you immediately. The grounds and rooms were super clean and spacious. We stayed in the Lagoon Villas which had 2 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, full kitchen, and living room. Absolutely gorgeous. Very well kept. I would definately reccommend the Catimiran trip. This is an all day relaxation experience. You are served food and drinks all day on the boat and stop at a deserted island to bathe in the sun or snorkel. Following that...you are brought to a deep sea reef where the schools of fish surround you. (Bring an underwater camera)We also booked a tour to see the Yungue rainforest with extended hike to La Mina falls. Gus was our tour guide...he was the BEST!!! If you hike through the forest and do not go in the waterfalls then you are crazy!!!!! It is so fresh you must drink some. Perfect. Loquillo beach and Old San Juan are also musts. All in all... the hotel was splendid and would go back in a jiffy. Bit expensive....but very nice. Say Hola to Pancho and Coco (the birds in the lobby) for me.!!!

<Content>Not worth it! I have never rated an hotel before. However our stay at the Caribe Hilton was so disappointing I had to write this and tell people how it really is and how it does not live up to the standards of a big hotel.First of all, eventhough we booked a room at the hilton thru the Hilton's website, we were given a room in a condominium next door that the hotel rents out for the individual owners. Bathrooms were very spacious but not very clean. Nothing in our room was working. The CD player, the safe, the TV.We went out and when we came back at 11pm, our door would not open. There was a housekeeper around and we asked her to help us. She tried her key and that didn't work either. Then she tells us that we have to go back to the front desk ( front desk is the main building next door since they put us in the comdominium) and security would have to come a fix our door...Overall, we have never been disappointed like this in any of our vacations...

<Content>An okay place to stay... We stayed at the Caribe in May 2007. We enjoyed our stay. The rooms were clean but could use some updates. The pool is very nice. There were plenty of lounge chairs to relax in. The beach is small but clean and well kept. The customer service at the hotel is average at best. Next time we visit Puerto Rico, we would look into staying at the Old San Juan. That's a gorgeous hotel with an authentic latin feel.

<Content>It's slipped since last time I have stayed at the Caribe Hilton twice before, but not in about 6 or 7 years. While the property still looks terrific, the rooms and views are wonderful, and the endless construction seems to be over, it's the staff that's slipped...dramatically. (Also, the Tommy Bahama store is gone in favor of some tacky clothing shop). Upon check-in (at the Hilton Honors Gold Members line) I was treated with indifference. I had time to kill at the bar (couldn't hit the pool: pouring rain and no luggage, anyway!) and the bar staff was cordial at best. Still without a change of clothes to go out to dinner, I had to eat in the bar/lounge area. My waitress was slow, grouchy, and also indifferent to my COLD sandwich. Things in this regard did improve somewhat over the several days I was there, but it wasn't the fabulous, friendly, go-out-of-their-way service I have experienced here before. Given the chance, I'll probably stay here again, but not as enthusiastically as in the past.

<Content>Amazing Caribe!!!! We have just returned from a wonderful vacation at the Caribe Hilton Resort and cannot say enough about their staff and the treatment we received! I travelled with my 19 year old daughter and my seven year old and I have to say, the staff was very nice and they certainly went out of their way to accomodate children of all ages, myself included, LOL!!. One instance in particular. We were fish feeding by the small pier next to the beach area when my son's favorite hat in the whole world flew away and landed in the water between the rocks. He was devastated!! This hat has alot of sentimental value to my son, so I took a chance and asked two employees if there was anything they can do. Without question or hestitation these nice gentlemen sprung into action and before I knew it they climbed onto the rocks (which is prohibited to vacationers) and used a tool that extended very far out and managed to capture my son's hat. I was cheering and people around me kept asking what's going on?, when I told them, they just shrugged their shoulders. My son was totally elated and thanked each and every one of them with a big hug. This was definitely a Catch Me At My Best Caribe Moment. The room was absolutely beautiful with an ocean view and immaculate. The food in Palmeras Restaurant was great and even though we weren't VIP's, we were treated like one...See you next summer Caribe!!!!

<Content>not bad at all After seeing all of the mixed reviews I was nervous about staying at the Hilton. It was good, clean, a decent place. I decided to try it for a 22 hour layover. One thing that you may like about this hotel is that the beach is private. Also there is NOTHING around the hotel area if you walk about a mile there is a park but it is pretty isolated, there are no restaurants or stores outside of the Hilton except for a crappy little Subway so you better have a car or be prepared to spend on a taxi. Yes it was expensive with everything one night is $363 for a single occupant. Good things: starbucks in lobby, private beach, nice layout. I did not understand the review that said that the beach was too far it was right there. Downside: the beach is not open so you can't go for long walks. I would recommend this place for people who want privacy and people who have kids! they have loads of stuff for kids to do on the premises and if I came with my family I would consider that. For my next layover I stayed at the intercontinental and you can read my review of that.

<Content>Our Honeymoon We got a great deal for our honeymoon at the Caribe Hilton!!! We had booked plane tickets but didnt have a hotel until a week before our trip. Caribe Hilton was the best deal, not too much money. The room did not have the greatest view, but I believe is because we pay the lowest price. We did not care anyway!! We only went there to sleep. the hotel grounds were great. The pool, the bar, the beach, the view.....was like paradise!!!!. The food was excellent, I never had a bad meal. ALthought the food was expensive ($75 dollars and up for two) we did not care, we were in our honeymoon and we had the best time. Old San Juan is just minutes away!! they had great Shops and restaurants. El morro is also minutes away. We cant imagine getting a better deal!!!! I cant wait to book my other trip and go back to the Caribe Hilton again.

<Content>Over Priced We stayed at both the Intercontinental and the Caribe Hilton in San Juan. We found the Intercontinental vastly superior to the Hilton.The Hilton is way overpriced. The food and drink prices are too high for the quality. Our room while spacious, was noisy (inside) from the elevators, and very noisy on the balcony from the roof top air conditioning units. One morning there was no hot water. To top it off, on the last morning we had a nice cockroach beside our bed.All of the employees were exceptionally nice. If you are looking at on or the other definitely stay at the Intercontinental

<Content>Caribe Hilton and its Pi帽a Coladas We stayed at the Caribe Hilton for four nights in June 2005. We were apprehensive at first because of the many bad reviews but when we arrived, the staff checked us in right away and when we asked for an upgrade, they gave it to us. We stayed in a renovated room in the new tower and it was great, with a beautiful ocean view. The beach was clean, and you could order anything from the hotel and they serve it to you right there. There was a slide in the water which was a lot of fun. The concierge was really helpful when it came to recommending restaurants in Old San Juan. Oh, and it was quite easy to get around using the cabs. Some of the reviewers mentioned that the cab rides were expensive, but for us (we live in DC), it was really inexpensive (around $6 to get into town). Overall, a great experience at a lovely hotel.

<Content>Could Be Just What You Want I just took my team on a 4-day trip to Caribe Hilton. If given the chance to do it over, I would certainly return. My wife and I (particularly my wife) are very discriminating travelers. Were we to go to Puerto Rico alone, we'd be unlikely to return. However, the Caribe Hilton was certainly fine enough to satisfy us (even her), and for a work-outing, it was a perfect fit.The outside areas of the hotel are beautifully done. The water is great, the resort property is vast and diverse, and in general, it was well-kept. The public areas of the hotel were spacious, clean and inviting. As for the rooms, this is not a new hotel. It has gone through a major renovation and we were not displeased - but you can only cover up so much in a 50-year hotel. Be sure you stay in one of the newer sections of the property! Here are some I shared with our travel agent who had directed us to this property:1. For what it is, the resort is great. Compared to other convention resorts, it scores well. As a high-end luxury retreat, it would not fare as well. The property is definately feeling its age - even in the tower where we stayed, they can only paint over, plaster over and carpet over so much. The common areas were good, and the pool/beach areas were laid out very nicely. But, it's not a new hotel.2. I found the location to be excellent. It's 10 minutes from the airport, within walking distance of casinos and restaurants, and its location on the water was great. The property is basically encased by two old forts, surrounded by a low stone wall, and in beautiful water. The outdoor area offers a great combination of pool (with waterfalls), beach, shaded hammocks, and grassy areas lined with palms.3. The spa was top notch. This includes the fitness center. High marks all around.4. We ate at two of the on-property restaurants. I would suggest doing no more than eating lunch at the property. The restaurants weren't bad, they just were very over-priced for what ended up being pretty pedestrian food and service.5. We went to three restaurants for dinner in Old San Juan. One was a local dive in a neighborhood we probably shouldn't have ventured to ... but it was great. The other two we would highly recommend: The Parrott Club and Aqua Viva. Great Food, Great Service and Great Atmosphere at both.

<Content>Super Hilton My family and I just came back from San Juan P.R. and we spent 7 days at the Hilton caribe and I must say that we enjoyed every moment of our stay. The staff was courteous and accomodatin. The pools were clean and the private beach was beutiful and safe for a five year old. I stayed in the Tower building and those rooms were great with a beutiful view of the beach and front garden. The room was clean and the bathromm was expansive and did not have any mildew or other growths on the fixtures or walls. The only drawback to the hotel was that the hotel is somewhat isolated from other places. So you are pretty much trapped in the facility, unless you want to spend cab money to get to the hotel and restaurant strip in Condado (half a mile or so away). If not, bring your wallet the food and drink prices are expensive (about $100.00 a day for a family of three) and they do not offer a package with meals. If you are adventerous, rent a car from Dollar across the street and explore the other parts of the island, it comes out somewhat less then the activity packages they offer. one other thing DO NOT DRIVE INTO OLD SAN JUAN take a taxi, it is better for your health and sanity.

<Content>Beautiful for a price.... My husband and I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Caribe Hilton Hotel in beautiful San Juan, Puerto Rico. I have been traveling to Puerto Rico all of my life and used to stay in the Caribe Hilton in the 1970's-1980's. The hotel recently underwent rennovations in the lobby. The rennovations are nice but to me I feel that the hotel has lost a lot of it's Puerto Rican charm. It seems to have become a mega resort. What I mean by that, is that it is not anymore a tranquil hotel as I remembered from my youth but is now a bustling resort with too many people and extremely high prices. We stayed in a garden room on the 10th floor. We had a beautiful view of the gardens below, the beautiful sea surrounding us and the historic fort. The rooms are pretty well maintained although I do think they can use some rennovations. The first and last nights that we stayed at the hotel were very nice and quiet. However the 2nd night of our stay was horrible. I cannot say it is the fault of the hotel but the people staying around us. They were slamming the doors all night long which of course made it very difficult to sleep. On our first day there we arrived around lunch time and had lunch in the grille. The food was very good and the lunch menu was pretty reasonable. We also decided to have dinner there. They offer different buffets every night of the week and although the food looked good we decided to order off of the menu. The dinner was o.k. and again the prices were o.k. On our second day we decided to have breakfast also in the grille. Well, this is where they really get you. When we first sat down they did not give us a menu. There was however a menu on the table. The menu only showed 2 or 3 options and then the $20.50 buffet. Well we are not huge eaters and so did not want to spend the $20.50 for the small amount of food we would be eating. We were about to leave when my husband asked if that was all they served. At that point, the waiter said, oh, no, we have another menu. I am assuming from what happened to us, that they try to get everyone to order the buffet so they do not give the full menu unless you ask for it. Well, needless to say, we ordered from the regular menu and to be perfectly honest, we ended up spending the same amount that we would have spent had we ordered the buffet. For an order of French Toast, eggs, orange juice and a cup of coffee it ended up costing us over $40.00. We have stayed in many resorts of this kind and even larger ones and have never, ever paid anything like that for breakfast. With that being said, I feel like they definitely take advantagebecause there are not a lot of places to go that are near the hotel. Fortunately, there is a Starbucks in the lobby and although you cannot get a hot breakfast from them at least you can get something to hold you over for breakfast and not spend a ton of money. We opted to eat breakfast at Starbucks for the remainder of our stay and it actually was quite good.  If you are looking for Puerto Rican cuisine in the Condado area, we ate at 2 pretty good restaurants for dinner. The first was Ajili Mojili. It is pretty moderately priced and the atmosphere and most important the food was very good. The other place I would recommend would be Ropa Vieja. If you only have one night to eat in the Condado area then this is the place I would say to visit. The atmosphere is really nice and the food is wonderful. Check out the spa at the Normandie Hotel, right next to the Caribe Hilton. Although it is a very small spa, the service is excellent and the prices are very reasonable.All in all, the Caribe Hilton is a beautiful resort, but due to the high prices, crowds and location, in the future I will probably opt for a different hotel for my stay in the San Juan area.

<Content>Typical Resort To my knowledge, this is one of the only full resort hotels actually located in old San Juan, although you will still need to take a $10 taxi to get to El Moro or SoFo or anywhere else (cab service is expensive in PR). On the other hand, you could just spend the entire day relaxing at the Hilton's massive private beach, spa and pool area - which is what we did while we were there.The rooms are clean and the view we had was excellent. All of our interactions with the staff were very pleasant. If you upgrade to their executive service you get access to a special room where they serve continental breakfast, happy hour appetizers and late night dessert. There are shops, restaurants and even a Starbucks at the hotel but everything is predictably bland and overpriced.This is a perfectly nice place to lie in the sand all day with a book and a cocktail, but there is nothing remarkable about the hotel.

<Content>Nice resort with prime location My wife and I stayed at this hotel for a few nights at the end of June. It has wonderful beaches, pools, and restaurants. The best part was its location. The hotel is far enough away from Old San Juan that it has its own beach and privacy, but yet just a short cab ride away. The other major resorts are out by the airport. There is so much happening in Old San Juan it was nice to be so close. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There is an excursions desk across from the concierge, we used both and were impressed with the recommendations and excursions. We highly recommend the illumincecnet bay, that alone is worth a trip to Puerto Rico. It should be noted, that the rooms do not have the fit and finish of the hotels of this caliber in major North American or even European cities. These things were all minor, but I thought I would mention them because if you are expecting comparable four or five star accommodations you might be disappointed. If you are looking to have fun, relax, and enjoy the island then you will enjoy this hotel.

<Content>I was scared to death, but... I was scared to death upon reading some reviews and called to cancel but was asked not to. Upon our arrival, it was as if they had read every negative review and sought to correct things. We lucked out with no wait to check-in, our room was ready despite a brief scare and a bell person was at our taxi the second we arrived. Our room was 1564 and the view was simply unbeatable (no exaggeration). The rooms in the tower are not spacious, they are actually smallish but not the filth factory I envisioned though the maids had not looked in the tv cabinet that had something most vile in it. It still smelled after having been removed. While the shower was large I could not get the water to get hot-ever. There was intrigue about the towels; though I asked for extra towels 3 additional sets to accompany the 1 existing set-each day, the maid would take the additional sets and only ever leave 1 set. The restaurants were pricey but really no different that any restaurant in a hotel. We did make use of the minimart/mompop across the street. We ate in the hotel鈥檚 palmeras restaurant and got the buffet (lamb/steak) $39.00 and found the food delicious and the service exceptional and gave the waiter a fantastic tip. The pina colada we tried (at the pool) was just horrible, the ameretto sours inside the bar area made my chest hurt (they had real booze-I allowed my chest to keep hurting). I was still alittle haunted by the bad reviews so we did alittle checking, we walked down the halls of the main building and did smell something moldy though we could not see inside the rooms-so don鈥檛 discount those reviews-those candid reviews saved us a horror show described by so many. A lot was made about the executive lounge-it has light snacks and a cash bar-it is not worth paying anything extra for.Watch out for the birds-they seem friendly enough but we witnessed alittle aviary violence-the white cockatoo bit a man that had monopolized it for at least 30 minutes. You can have a good time at this hotel-if you use it for sleeping and a meal or two and the pool-it is not the main attraction-Puerto Rico is so see it.

<Content>Room was flooded, clean but not friendly ppl I went thinking because the cost was more that it would be a nice hotel. My first room was flooded, and the decor was way outdated! When I asked to be placed in another room, the front desk person was Rude, and almost refused to put me in another room (until I asked to speak to the manager). The hotel wants to you to pay for any and everything, and it not cheap prices. The people that work at the hotel are rude, and seem like everyone was having a bad day. I been to allot of Hotels in PR, and this is the worst. Better off Staying at any sheratons, or Holiday Inn. The hotel had high speed internet, that worked 1/2 the time and they want to charge you for it?? Most hotels in PR offer internet access for free. I will never go back. Food was ok, but again way too much money. You would think you where on Park ave in NYC. and the hotel is old and outdated, they do not even have a casino.

<Content>Great but pricey The Caribe Hilton is a great hotel - close to Old San Juan, ports and airport without being right on top of any of them. Our reservations were made at a good rate but that may be, at least in part, because of the whole passport busines. The rooms were very nice and service was very good. The best part about this hotel is the pool and beach. The pool is very nice but sometimes crowded and the beach is very nice and relatively quiet. Hammocks among the palm trees was the highlight. We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights before taking a cruise and got just what we bargained for, a chance to unwind.Now, the bad news. The cost of a single mixed drink, with a modest tip, will set you back $11. And, while they have 4 restaurants on the premises, they all charge Hilton prices. We saved some cash by eating several meals at the Subway nearby and taking advantage of the small market, where you can buy a liter of PR's finest for less than the cost of one mixed drink by the pool. There are no other restaurants nearby. However, for the price of a roundtrip cab ride (about $25 - both directions) you can have a nice meal in Old San Juan and still save money.We learned from the concierge that massive renovations are due later this year - probably October to November and by the size of the renovations, I would expect a stay at the Caribe to be less enjoyable than it would be today. I would definitely call and ask about the status of renovations before making a reservation.

<Content>Old and Tired Hotel My wife and I stayed at this hotel May 18-23, 2007. We are Hilton Diamond Club members so we were supposed to get the best room they had available. Well, that didn't happen. Our room was on the 16th floor, just above the major construction site of the new Hilton casino. We did have a view of the ocean/bay but we had to go out on the patio to see it.  The rooms were ok and the beds were comfortable. The maid service was good - nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about either.  The prices of food and drinks at the hotel are outrageous! We went across the street to a convenience store and bought our drinks and snacks. We ate breakfast in the hotel (it was free) but all other meals were taken in Old San Juan. Puerto Rican food is just terrific. You can only experience the REAL Pureto Rican culture and food if you eat in an authentic Puerto Rican restaurant. The Caribe Hilton restaurants have a lot to offer for those of you who want to throw your money away. However, I highly recommend you venture out to other restaurants for your meals. Finally, I'll say that the grounds/landscape of the Hilton hotel arealso old and tired. The pools are nice but had STUFF floating in the main pool every night (we have no idea what it was but we have suspicions!) and the beach on the ocean is protected by a sea wall. We couldn't take the constantly screaming kids at the beach or the pool area so our trips to the beach and pool were few and far between - what a waste.  All in all, we did enjoy the city of Old San Juan and a big plus is that the beds in the Caribe Hilton were comfortable. Thats about it.....I don't like to be negative.

<Content>Service oriented hotel My husband and I stayed at the Hilton 6/8 through 6/17. We found the staff to be very accommodating and friendly. It is unfortunate that there is some major construction going on but if you are at the front of the hotel, you do not hear it. Avoid the villas until the construction is complete! We had a beautiful view from our 13th floor tower room and found the room clean and mold free. It is nice that they provide mini fridges instead of mini bars. You can buy juices etc at the store across from the hotel. The grounds are beautiful, pool is great, and beach area is ok. There is an area of shaded hammocks that are very inviting. While you are wandering the grounds grab a handful of bread from the towel stand and head out the pier to feed the fish.The restaurants in the hotel are pretty good. Our least favorite was the Italian, too much salt used. Our favorite was the Lemon Grass. Order the filet with stilton sauce. YUM! Do not forget to say hi to Victor and Manuel, the day bartenders in the hotel lobby bar. They take VERY good care of you.Overall, we had a wonderful vacation and will go back next time we go to PR.

<Content>Disappointment This was once a great hotel but with time and the add ons it has suffered. The drink machine offered soft drinks at $250. each but was empty. After taking our three ones it coughed back a one and two dollars in dimes. At that price you'd think they'd keep it full.Food is extremely expensive. Breakfast for one will hit you for $30. and is average at best. Forget room service. The taxes and fees drive up the cost of a less than spectacular meal beyond where one likes to go.A $214. room rate gets more than $50. a night tacked on in taxes and resort fees. Couple all of this with a staff that has few gems in it and it is best to find another place to stay. We found the people to be condescending, partial to other Spanish speaking folks and in some instances simply rude. I had not been back to Caribe Hilton for 20 years but remembered it fondly. That memory has been updated. Sadly the hotel hasn't.

<Content>Not Happy with the Caribe Hilton or San Juan We just returned from San Juan, stayed at the Caribe Hilton, June 2nd thru June 9th. Had to change rooms 4 times requested the Hilton Towers and they put us in the main building it was very old and and dirty tub was moldy and there were holes in the walls and ceiling. Asked to be moved 2nd day, we were moved to the towers 12th floor it was nice much better room and an excellent view. Got up next morning to find check out papers from the room when I called front desk they said that the room was booked and we would have to move. We were moved to the 5th floor construction all day and no view, went down to see manager and he could not understand why the moved us but said he would put us in nice room. Finally in nice room but each time we were given a room we had to wait till 6pm to get in the room. My husband said good thing we had suitcases with wheels cause he said they got warn out from moving. The showers were nice BUT in every room there was mold on the floor they could use some clorox to clean them. I didnot find the people in San Juan to be friendly, everyone spoke Spanish, it is very expensive. All the fees they add to your room is crazy, plus to get a cab anywhere it was $15 each way and they tell you its not safe to walk. I did not find the beach to be very nice, I did think the pool was nice. If you eat breakfast in the restaurant it is over priced and the service is very bad. I feel this Hotel is more for business travelers and they are more receptive to people coming for conferences. I guess all in all I will not go back to the Caribe Hilton. We actually tried to book a cruise out of San Juan the first Sunday we were there but the change in the airline ticket would have cost us another $1,000 so we decided to stay and make the best of it. There is no place like the Radisson in Aruba, way way better....

<Content>Great place with a wonderful view! My wife and I vacationed there last year. It was by far the best time we have ever had.We spent a little bit more and got a newer room with ocean view. It was worth every penny of it. The room was located in their newer building, the tower. It has brand new furniture. The shower is the best I have seen.This hotel has a private beach, which is a big plus. It is very clean. The staffs were friendly and helpful.We are definitely going back there.

<Content>Nothing special Stayed 3 days mid-May for a biz conference. Arrived promptly at check in time on a Thursday to be told my long-reserved room was booked, with the inference I should have arrived earlier (!) This after being ignored in the Hilton Honors special check in line which the desk clerks studiously ignored. Stuck in a garden room with no sealed windows the first night, moved myself for the next night (after being told to leave my bags packed for the day, that they would move them) and got a room in the Honors tower just above a long expanse of roof and exhaust vents, the ocean in the distance. One has the impression that those paying the rack rate get the nice rooms, everyone else is everyone else. Room was fairly large and nicely furnished, ditto the bathroom, pool is quite small given the # of rooms here, nearby beach is a better bet. Local street access is tough to follow, best to look in the sky for the Hilton mural on the tower if you're driving and just aim for it. All in all just average, the 10% resort fee was overreaching, the checkin experience was the worst part of the stay and I'll stay elsewhere next time.

<Content>Great hotel, best vacation ever We just came back from a week-long vacation in San Juan, PR. I read reviews of multiple hotels before made reservations and decided to stay at Caribe Hilton. Great choice!I was a little concerned about reviews that mentioned molding rooms that smelled awful. As soon as I booked my trip I called the hotel directly and asked for a recently renovated room. My request was honored. We were placed in HH Towers. The room was great - we asked for 2 double beds - they were so comfortable. The room was rather spacious and the bathroom was great too - with nice shower. I read in one of the reviews that if you stay in the Towers you get access to free continental breakfast. Right on! We got free breakfast every morning - just swipe your access key and it works. Another tip -- there are free appetizers and rather cheap alcohol between 5 and 7.30pm every day served in the same lounge where you eat breakfast. Everybody complains about how expensive everything at the resort is, but if you go to the executive lounge you get $3 glass of wine and $4 hard liquor.... you can鈥檛 beat that, can you? Plus you get free appetizers.About food - I live in NYC so to me it didn鈥檛 seem overpriced. There is Subway next to the hotel but I would rather personally get a nice sandwich and salad at the Grill at the Hotel for $7 than a nasty sandwich at Subway for $5. You decide. Food is delicious at all the restaurants located in this hotel.The hotel itself is beautiful. I don鈥檛 know what others complain about - lobby is spectacular, the beach area is secluded and just perfect. Pool area is large too. No problem getting towels or umbrella.Staff is very friendly and ready to help. Example: I was ordering lunch while lounging by the pool. The waiter came over to take my order. She asked if I wanted a drink - I said no and she saw that I had a bottle of water standing on my table. In few minutes she came back with my sandwich and glass full of ice- I didn鈥檛 even ask for it! That鈥檚 what I call great service- when you don鈥檛 even have to ask for it. Condado area is located across a bridge and is about 15-20 min walk away. There are many restaurants there. I was not impressed by any of them. But again, I am very picky having lived in NYC. There is a small convenience store next to the hotel. If you are out of sunscreen, don鈥檛 buy it at the store located on hotel's premises (outrageous prices) - walk a few steps over to the convenience store and pay just $7.As far as activities are concerned, we went on sailing and snorkeling tour which was great! They take you to 2 different islands and there is so much fish there, it鈥檚 breathtaking. I booked the trip at the activities desk at the hotel. It was $89/person including tax and it included free bus ride to Fajardo area as well.We also went to Old San Juan - not on tour, just took a cab - it was $12 on the way there and $10 back. We went to El Morro - admission is $3/person and it was really cool. The food was way better in Old San Juan than in Condado. Try Berlin Cafe. It was great.We didnt rent a car - we figured we would not need it. There are cabs everywhere and there is so much to do at the hotel plus the different tours available i thought it was unnecessary to have a car.

<Content>Good enough I had some trepidations about staying at this hotel after reading some of the other reviews. After a pleasant four day stay at this hotel, I have to conclude that those who hated the place either had unrealistic expectations, or they were given a completely unrenovated room.  The reviews indicate that the Garden rooms were the worst, so we knew that we wouldn't agree to stay in that wing. We did request the Hilton Honors tower, and were somewhat surprised and disappointed when we were told that they didn't have a room available in the tower. However, we were given a room on one of the higher floors in the main building, which they considered to be an executive room. Perks included use of the Executive room which provided a free Continental breakfast, coctail hour (mainly cheese and fruit), dessert in the evening, and free access to the internet. Given the expensive restaurants in the hotel, the breakfast saved us a decent amount of money, and consisted of the usual Continental fare. The food was constantly being replenished by the staff. The room was on the smaller side, but not tiny. It had relatively new carpeting and a decent bathroom. It was well maintained and very clean. The duvet cover was pilling which was annoying because the white threads stuck to our pj's, but otherwise, the bed was comfortable.The lobby was attractive and open. The beach was great for swimming and kayaking. I loved it because the water was calm and clear. For those who like to surf, find another hotel. Palm trees provided shade if you didn't want to get an umbrella. Chairs were plentiful on the beach and by the pool. The restaurants were generally overpriced and the food just OK, except for the Lemongrass which was fabulous. It was romantic and the food was wonderful. All in all, if you view the Caribe Hilton as a 3.5 star hotel and not a 4 star hotel, you shouldn't be disappointed. We liked the fact that it was not on a crowded strip, like most of the other hotels in the Condado area and in Isla Verde.

<Content>Nice Place GREAT location with Private beach and a great pool. Rooms were very nice (not great). Room was bigger than average and had a nice balcony overlooking the ocean. My only complaint was that the front desk gave me and another guest bad directions to our rooms and we both had to come back and get better directions (the other person had to go back a third time)

<Content>Just OK Stayed over a weekend at this resort. I say resort because they charge you a Resort Fee. I've been in much nicer Hilton's before; but, everything in San Juan appears to have seen it's better days. More of a place for families with small children. I wouldn't recommend to singles or couples looking for a quite relaxing vacation out by the pool.

<Content>Okay room, great beach We chose the Caribe Hilton as the hotel to spend the night at prior to the cruise. I tried on several occasions to get one of the great rates that others had reported by using Priceline.com, but was never able to get my bid accepted. Finally, about a month or so out, I booked an ocean view room at full price. We arrived at 3:00 pm, only to find out our room wasn鈥檛 ready yet 鈥?which was to be somewhat expected, as our reservations stated the room would be ready by 4:00. We were told we could use the changing facilities and the pool area while we were waiting if we wanted. Our room was made available to us promptly at 4:00 pm. We were in the 鈥渙lder鈥?section of the hotel, and the hallway smelled slightly musty. The room felt somewhat dated, and probably not what I would normally expect for a high end hotel (and a high price tag). It was however in good repair, and more than adequate for our one night stay. I have read that if you complain, you may get upgraded to one of the newer rooms, but again, we were only here for one night, and the room was more than adequate. The grounds however were stunning! The beach and pool areas were immaculate. We spent the early evening, and the next morning snorkeling in the beach swimming area, and were surprised by the number of fish we saw. One word of caution: If you plan to eat at the hotel, plan on dropping some serious coin, even for a hamburger ($16.50 as I recall). Never fear though, there is a Subway just around the corner, and a Starbucks in the hotel for some reasonable breakfast snacks. Check out time was noon, so around eleven we checked out, and stored our bags in the lobby area so that we could do a little sight seeing down town before boarding the cruise ship. If you are looking for some beach time, this may be a good choice for you. If you are just looking for a place to lay your head, find something cheaper - unless of coarse you are willing to pony up for one of the executive rooms!

<Content>Be advised about this Hilton We stayed at this Hilton due to it's great location, attractive grounds and Hilton's reputation for quality. Though recently remodeled, it was evident that the hotel rooms were tired older rooms with simply some fancy new furnishigs. They failed to warn us that the ocean views were obstructed by construction, unless you stay in the higher floors. I must admit though, the bed was comforatable and the pillows were wonderful. We spent some time laying in the sun and watching families swim in the hotel's cove, only to learn from the local news later that evening that there was a city-wide alert warning people not to swim in the waters near the hotel that day due to a health hazard having to do with raw sewage being dumped into the ocean water nearby. We were surprised that the hotel chose not to limit access to the cove by its guest. Finally, when we were checking out of the hotel, we noticed a charge was posted on our bill titled Voluntary Contribution to the Children of Puerto Rico fund or similar. There was nothing voluntary about it. Apparently they conveniently slip this charge into the room bills, and unless you happen to notice and dispute it, you pay it. I told some Puerto Rican friends about this and they found it humorous that the hotel would attempt such a thing, assuring me that the funds did not get used for that purpose. So, for the next time I stay at the Caribe Hilton, I would like to thank them in advance for the voluntary contribution of a comfy fluffy Hilton pillow my luggage, as my wife so happens to be a former Child of Puerto Rico. Seriously, if you stay at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan, ask questions and don't take anything for granted.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay! We spent 8 days in early April at the Caribe Hilton. We had a room in the Hilton Honors tower (15th floor) with ocean view. We were traveling on Hilton points and my husbnad was a diamond member. First, we really enjoyed our very relaxing stay. Our room was small for four people. There was not a lot of room to put away all the clothes. So, we had one living out of a suitcase. The room itself was in decent shape. I think it could use new carpeting. The bathroom was updated recently. We had a great view of the ocean and the beds were very comfortable. Make sure you get a topsheet on your bed. We did not and asked for one. We ate breakfast downstairs at the Hilton Honors free breakfast. It was perfect for our family as it had bagels, cereal and fruit and sweets.There is soda and water available all day at the Honors room and also had free appetizers at night. Lunches we had mostly by the pool/beach area. We found the food to be fresh and good. Dinners on property we had were, Madrid-This was just okay. I would not return although the waiters were very nice, the food was pricey and very mediocre. Il Giardano-The italian restaurant was our favorite. I would gladly go back. I had the veal parmigiana and it was excellent. We also ate twice in the buffet restaurant for dinner called Palmeras. The roasted meats night was a good variety and we enjoyed it and found the price reasonable. The lobster night was expensive and disappointing. I would not go back for that.The grounds are large and have everything for a relaxing vacation. We were truly spent much of our town at the resort. The beach is small, but the ocean was calm enough for the kids to swim and enjoy. There was very good snorkeling around the rock areas and my husband learned to scuba dive next door and swam just past the rocks with the scuba group. He said this was the best experience and highly recommends it. We would definitely go back to the Caribe Hilton. I think some rooms are older and more worn than others. I also think a smile and a gracias goes a long way. Be polite and people were very friendly. Enjoy!

<Content>Not worth the money!!! Just came back from an all girls trip to Puerto Rico. We originally booked the Caribe Hilton with the expectations of a nice hotel. The lobby was beautiful but after seeing the room we quickly exited stageleft. Definitely not worth the money!! We got the unrenovated side. There are a lot of options in Puerto Rico and if you are going to pay, you might as well get a nice option. So we headed over to the Marriott. It was beautiful. The lobby was nice. The bell men were cute and the rooms were clean and nicely decorated. Our first room had some leakage problems and we were promptly relocated (with help) and given a $100 credit. After realizing all the taxi rides were going to cost a small fortune, we chose the bus. Only $.75 each way! The bus goes everywhere from Old San Juan to Isle Verde and even the airport. Old San Juan is nice and perfect for tourists. We found a little shack by the port that served the best Marlin pastelillos, the manager, Andres is really nice. We also caught the ferry over to the Bacardi plant for free drinks!!! The souvenir shops definitely weren鈥檛 as cheap as the Bahamas. The clubs were okay. Too many young people though. Senior Frogs has a great atmosphere but leaves something to be desired in the food department. We decided we wanted to get away from the tourist spots and wanted to rent a car. The Hertz desk at the hotel wanted $40 a day!!! So I went down to the business center which is open 24 hours a day and booked a small compact car using Hotwire for $12.95 a day. The total for the day was less than $20. The only bad thing is the $14 parkingfee at the hotel is ridiculous!!! We rode the bus to the airport, picked up the car, and hit the highway. There are small tolls as you drive up the highway, the most expensive one was $1.50. We drove up to the El Yunque rainforest, which was only a 45 minute drive. The tours from area hotels range from $40-$50. So we were expecting an entrance fee of some sort. Well to our surprise it was completely FREE. We walked thetrail to the La Mina waterfall. We didn鈥檛 go to the peak this time, we heard it was beautiful. Either way, you can鈥檛 beat this FREE excursion.All in all we had a great trip to Puerto Rico. I would stay at the Marriott again, however, I would rather rent a condo off the beach.

<Content>Great Stay My wife and I went down for our 25th and had a great stay. Had a room in the main Bldg. in the executive floor. Had a view of the lagoon and ocean, very nice view. Very quite and laid back. Room was very nice and cleaned everyday. The view from the other side is of the ocean and the city. Were givin the chance to have either view. The exective lounge was a great extra to have. Very nice Cont. breakfast in the morning for free and were able to get water , soda for the beach for the afternoon. Save alot of money that way. Pool and the lagoon were real nice and clean. Not very many people were there so we could sit almost any where we wanted to. Service at the swim up bar was ok. Morton,s steak house was GREAT. Went into town for another dinner, the cab into old san jaun was 10.00 plus 2.00 tip. Also went to the El San Juan hotel and casino for a 20.00 cab. Hilton was a great place to really relax and just chill out and enjoy the good weather. PS. If you get a room in the new towers bldg. it is a pretty long walk to the pool and lagoon. The main Bldg. is right next to everything. The Garden view section has its own pool but very small and people tell me the rooms are very old too. If you want to just get away and chill out , the hilton is the place to do that.

<Content>Disappointed Hello-We just got back from a week at the Caribe Hilton. My husband  I were there from April 25 to May 2nd. This is a big hotel with over 800 rooms. Check in time is 4pm  check out is noon. There is the main building (original building)  the tower section. Try to stay in the tower section, as these rooms were supposedly newly renovated. We stayed on the 9th floor of the main building. We were supposed to have an ocean view. The rooms are not directly facing the water, so we had a side view. Unfortunately also overlooking the top of the building  had to deal with noise from some sort of motor. We were offered to make a move, but had to wait a few days-so we stayed where we were-but did not relax sitting on the patio (which was small anyway). The room could have used some 鈥淯pdating鈥? It does have a coffeemaker, un-stocked refrigerator, a safe, ironing board, iron  blow dryer. You can order room service, keep in mind they charge you an extra 15% gratuity, plus $3.00 delivery charge~ a 陆 grapefruit cost $5.50, a pint of Haagen Daaz was $14. There is also pay per view to order on the tv in the room, but they charge about $13-$15 to watch a movie. So stick with the tv choices. The plus, if you had a laptop they did have in room a high speed internet connection. The beach is very small  does look like it was a man-made beach. Yes it is private  they made a wall of rocks to keep the water calm. Not a lot of space on the beach, so there is a cement decking where a lot of people chose to relax. You can rent an umbrella, floats, snorkeling mask($10 hour) etc. There is also a shaded area with a few hammocks. There is a multi level pool  two Jacuzzis on one side of the hotel, the other side had a smaller pool  jacuzzi. There is a dock you can walk out  look at the fish-you can feed them left over bread (ask at the towel hut). There is a pretty tropical garden with swans  other birds  koi swimming on the side of the hotel. After being used to going to 鈥淎ll-Inclusive鈥?resorts, this was a BIG shock to us on the prices of food  drinks. They did have a few restaurants to choose from-鈥淢orton鈥檚 Steakhouse鈥? 鈥淢adrid-San Juan鈥?Spanish), 鈥淩otisserie Il Giardino鈥?Northern Italian),鈥滾emongrass鈥?Pan Asian Latino), 鈥淧almeras鈥?offers buffet dining options also, breakfast was $20.50 per person, 鈥淥las Health Bar鈥? 鈥淎tlantico鈥?snack bar dining outside)  a 鈥淪tarbucks鈥? They also had the 鈥淥asis Bar鈥?inside with nightly entertainment  a small swim up bar in the pool 鈥?not that big of an area-more of a walk up bar in the water with stools. The food we ate there was good鈥?but very expensive!!! You can walk to a 鈥淪ubway鈥?about 5 minute walk- but they are doing some work on that street  there is a horrible odor-so that was not an option for us. You should try to get the 鈥淓xecutive鈥?plan-as they offer you a continental breakfast in the morning, cookies  fruit in the afternoon, hor doeuvres in the evening  desserts later. You also get free coffee, tea, soda, juice  water there. Also there is a computer to check your emails. There is a nice BIG health club with 30 cardiovascular  circuit training machines-treadmills,steppers,ellipticals,bicycles,rowing machine,versa climber,free weights  鈥淔lex Fitness Circuit Training System鈥? They do offer babysitting  there is a kids club, game room, playground(which we did not have use for). They had a daily schedule of activities, but unfortunately it rained for most of our trip, so we did not partake. There is a spa as well, offering massages,facials,body  water therapies. They have a car rental place  some stores(drugstore type store, gift shop, upscale boutiques). They have a travel desk-which again seemed pricey. We did the Camuey Caves  observatory-about $83 a person. The caves were okay, the observatory was a waste-they don鈥檛 explain about anything. My husband wanted to go fishing 鈥?he had a lot of problems arranging that. That is not a popular place to go out fishing. He do go out for a half a day  they did not catch anything, plus it was about $200 for himself to share a boat. It gets expensive traveling 鈥?the taxis charge a few dollars extra from the hotel to go someplace. Most taxi rides are about $15 plus tip. Try to take the bus to Old San Juan, for 50 cents. Really is not much in walking distance  because of all the construction, we chose not to walk. This was not an issue though, as we were concerned. Maybe because of all the rain we had, they were not working. If money is not an issue  a small beach is alright 鈥?then I guess if you stay in the tower section this would be alright-seems more of a place to go for business meetings not a real relaxing, beautiful vacation. Everything there is very expensive  overall did not find most of the people friendly. As for us, we would not go back again.

<Content>Lovely stay in Puerto Rico We loved our week long stay at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The landscaping was incredibly beautiful with just about every type of palm tree swaying in the constant breeze from the ocean. The multiple pools including one with an infinity edge were inviting and refreshing. The service we received was excellent! The reservationists, bell captains, waiters, security personnel, housekeeping and maintenance were friendly and very helpful. The Olas Spa is a must for anyone who needs a little pampering. They also had a nice variety of restaurants and a couple of bars right on site. Our only criticism was the extremely high prices for food and drink at the hotel. Drinks including Beer started at around $8 each and most ala carte entrees including pasta dishes started at $25 and up. Of course, you could always go into town to eat but prices were a bit high there as well. All in all, we would definately recommend the Hilton Caribe to those looking to stay in Puerto Rico!

<Content>No thank you, Caribe Hilton I was very disappointed. I did a lot of research on properties in San Juan so that my family and I would have a great vacation. (husband, myself, and two kids 2  7). Despite the reviews I had read for months (thinking the people were overcritical) I booked it anyway. I had a rate of 230 per night but felt that with all the promises it was worth it. The lobby is beautiful and the Starbucks is good...the private beach was fine...We arrived on the last flight into San Juan and arrived to the hotel about 11pm...we were not taken to the room until about midnight. It was an ordeal getting checked in and I was a HIlton Honors member. I had requested an upper level floor...I was given the Garden Terrace (if you get this...change it immediately). We had to take an elevator down to our room. People joked and asked if we were sleeping in the basement. The Garden Terrace is a decent hotel room with a dirty patio...with dirty cheap patio furniture...overlooking the facilities area with the exception of the plants/foliage that is place in front of the patio. There are walkways on the other side of your hedge. I did not feel it was worth staying at the hotel in that room for 230 a night (along with the 5 dollar per person...including children...surcharge per day...that's an extra hundred dollars on the bill). I spent two hours on the internet (wifi was an extra 15 dollars a day) looking for something else...not an easy feat during spring break...but we found something great and I am pleased that I was given the room otherwise I probably wouldn't have been motivated to move. If you want more choices for restaurants and shops...Isla Verde is better located.

<Content>Beautiful grounds We were booked in a double double Villa (supposedly an upgraded room) which we found very cramped. They add a small bar type sink, a second fridge and a microwave to the Villa but the bathroom and room itself is much smaller than the Tower double double rooms. We switched to the Tower because the room was small and the view was of a construction site next door. Tower room more spacious with a beautiful view, fridge, large closet and huge bathroom with walk in shower. I would have preferred two Queen beds instead of the two Double beds which were very small. The grounds are the best part of the hotel. They have a beautiful pool area, shaded area with palm trees and hammocks and their own lagoon with beach. A lot of the hotels say ocean front but have no beach access. We never had a problem finding a lounge chair no matter what time we got downstairs. The staff will even bring you an umbrella and put it in the ground for you (free of charge). The staff is friendly and helpful. The food is very expensive. We spent $100 for four of us for a breakfast buffett. After that we had the free Hilton Honors breakfast and ate elsewhere for all meals. The hotel is a short cab ride to the airport as well as Old San Juan. I'd stay there again, mostly because of the grounds and convenient location.

<Content>Nice, Friendly The grounds were very nice, the staff very accommodating and friendly. The food and drinks were very expensive ($7.50 for a Shirley Temple!!) The Italian Restaurant was very good and they have a very reasonable kids menu. If you drink beer, buy it at the mini-mart across the street. Take a cab into Old San Juan to eat, even with the cost of the cab it's still less expensive than eating at the hotel. If you're staying in the towers there's a free continental breakfast on the second floor that they don't advertise (I think it's supposed to be for executive travellers and/or memebers of their diamond club but your room key will give yoou access.)

<Content>We loved the Caribe Hilton! My family and I have just returned, reluctantly, from a week at the Caribe Hilton. We had a wonderful and relaxed week, with consistently excellent service, beautiful food, and comfortable surroundings. We arrived after midnight and checked into a room on the Executive level of the main building. Our room was simply decorated, with the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Even though we were traveling on Hilton points, we had complimentary chocolates and Evian waiting for us. The room was clean, but the carpets and upholstered furniture were rather worn and water-stained, and the room was a bit small for two adults and two teenagers. The next day, we stopped by the HHonors desk and asked if there were a larger room available. Our request was handled with grace and efficiency by Mr. Luis Sanchez 鈥?he moved us into an enormous one bedroom suite at the top of the Garden building. We quadrupled our space!The Hilton is not new, and there are areas that are in need of updating. Both our first and our upgraded room had need of a bit of attention (a missing drawer pull, a shower fixture that squirted a bit), but we were clear that we were spending a week, not moving in, and had a clean and comfortable place to sleep and change and have a bit of down time. Our room was immaculately cleaned daily, with an abundance of towels. The furniture was colorful and comfortable and again, the bed was sublime.Unlike the previous reviewer, we had a beautiful meal at Morton鈥檚. Our dinner at Lemongrass was phenomenal. We also thought the tapas at Madrid were rather uninspired, although the service was friendly, helpful, and speedy. Even the cheeseburgers at the poolside restaurant, Atlantico, were excellent. And the fruit! Lovely fresh fruit salads everyday. We generally skipped breakfast, and waited for poolside lunches at 11:00. When we needed breakfast, however, the HHonors lounge continental spread was sufficient. Room service breakfast one early morning was expensive, but VAST 鈥?two orders more than fed four of us. We only enjoyed the buffet dinner at Palmeras once, and found it excellent 鈥?with possibly the best lamb chops (chuletas) I have ever had. Yes, the food  beverage service is relatively expensive, but anyone who lives or travels in New York will find this Hilton no steeper. The drinks were $8, but we鈥檙e paying more than $10 in New York (and even Providence) restaurants. Considering that we were traveling on Hilton points, we were happy to pay for good food and drinks.The grounds, gardens, pools, and beach are all beautiful and well cared for. I was dubious about the beach, since it looks very small in all the photos I saw, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it big enough, with plenty of room to drift off on a raft without bumping anyone. Most people seemed to prefer the pools, which were also big enough for all of us.I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, I鈥檇 be happy to return to the Caribe Hilton, even without points!

<Content>great! kids loved it, we loved it. we stayed for 2 nights pre cruise and couldn't have asked for anything more. the rooms in the hilton tower were great, fab bathrooms - huge shower! pool area was lovely, great for kids of all ages and on the other side of the path from the pool was the hotels private secure beach. food for lunch was very good and reasonably priced and at night we got a taxi from the front of the hotel who took us to the hard rock cafe in town. we arranged for him ( eddie) to pick us up, and he was right on time, and he also took us to the ship and picked us up on our return and dropped us at the airport.all in all, a great experience!

<Content>Overall good My fiance and I recently went to San Juan looking for a place to stay when we return to get married this summer. The Caribe Hilton is near Old San Juan, has several restaurants, a sizeable private beach, a multilevel pool with swim-up bar, nice ocean views, and a cool inner courtyard. Overall, we were very happy with it. We were able to have some romantic moments around the property, while others enjoyed being there in family groups or for business meetings. It does a pretty good job overall of balancing the various desires of these often quite different groups.We stayed in a ground-level room in the Garden wing. It was a nice room, well-kept etc., but I would have liked to have had an outdoor patio, which the room didn't have. It was quiet and well-kept.The restaurant we really loved was Lemongrass. It has really good Asian-Fusion food and a cool decor right on the inner courtyard of the hotel - bubbling water, bug and frog sounds at night, etc. Other than that, the morning buffets were good. And we liked the swim-up bar - their drinks were good, and the music was also better than elsewhere in the pool area. The pool area casual food bar (I believe it was called Atlantic) was okay on the one time we ate there. Whatever you do, eat as much of the fresh fruit as you can - I didn't have any that wasn't really good!The pools themselves were nice, with an adequate amount of chairs situated throughout the pool and beach area, as well as a few hammocks. They even have a separated area for pool games, so those who want to play water volleyball aren't bonking others in the head with their volleys, which we appreciated. They also had a small side kiddie pool, which is nice for those with kids (we don't have any).A little warning about going into Old San Juan: the cabs are $10 across the board in Old San Juan - they go by zones. So although you may only be going from the very edge of Old San Juan back to the hotel, expect to pay $10 (plus gratuity). We had to just deal with that and remember that it's still cheaper than renting a car and parking it at the hotel parking garage! On some maps it looks like a very short walk into Old San Juan - it's probably about 2 1/2 miles, though, not the 1/2-3/4 of a mile it looked like on one map we saw. Just a caution, so you know what the distance is.A tip for the pale ones among us: don't even THINK of going outside without sunscreen, even for a short time, even in the spring! I was outside for a whopping 20 minutes before I remembered to put on sunblock, and I got relatively burned (mild peeling on my shoulders).As far as expense, the hotel is a bit pricey, but it's mostly worth it for all the stuff to do right on the property and within easy reach of a short car trip. That makes it a good choice for those who are looking to just hang out at the hotel and relax, so you don't need to go searching for things to do or places to eat every day.Overall, I think the hotel does a good job of presenting something for everyone, and making it easy to relax and wind down at the hotel.

<Content>Nice stay We recently returned from a 6 night stay at the Caribe Hilton (3/30-4/5). Wife and I took our two young children. We arrived around 1PM and were told our room was not ready yet (official check in time is 4PM) and were given a phone number to call to check up on room status during wait. Room was ready at 3PM and we were upgraded to an ocean front room in the tower building which was a pleasant surprise since I did not bother to ask for an upgrade seeing as the hotel was fully booked. Room in the tower building was very modern and clean with a flat screen TV and large bathroom. Only ding on room was there was no bathtub (instead a very large shower) which prefer for the little ones. As mentioned in prior reviews, the grounds are very nice. I found the staff on the whole very friendly and accomadating as well. Our package (booked through a travel agent) included complimentary breakfast. The breakfast buffet was one of the better ones I have seen compared to other hotels in this class and price range. The Lemongrass restaurant located on the property was outstanding. As a comparison, we stayed four years ago in PR at the Marriott Stelaris. Would give the Hilton higher marks on grounds, pool and private beach. Marriott's main advantage is that it is right in the heart of Condado so you can walk right out the door and hit restaurants and shopping. The Hilton is fairly isolated with only a Subway and small convenience store located near. On the whole, both hotels provide for good family vacation.

<Content>Great location, spotty room service Located close to Old San Juan, nice beach. Concierge service was good. Room service was mediocre (or non-existent - read on). We were told a couple of times that a technician would be sent to adjust the airconditioner - no one showed up. We requested extra towels one evening when our room was not cleaned as we requested - and we were'nt shocked when they did not show up.Overall would recommend for location and choice of restaurants, just don;t expect stellar service.

<Content>For laying out, this place couldn't be more convenient, but... If you are looking to just lay in the sun, then this place is great. They have plenty of chairs, towels and choices: a small strip of beach sand, several pool areas, and a breezy section overlooking the ocean. Everything in the resort is very convenient: they have several places to eat (expect to pay resort prices), a swim-up bar (again, resort prices!), a Starbucks, a center to check your email, etc. So for sunbathing and relaxing, this place is great. If your looking for a more cultural, ethnic trip then being out at the resort could be a bit of a hassle. For a real taste of San Juan, you need to get outside the resort and go into Old San Juan (about a 10 minute drive). There you find more of the food and flavor of the area. Cabbing back and forth can add up quickly, but driving there is even more expensive with valeting and city parking -- plus the driving there is a little crazy -- confusing and fast-paced -- even for this city driver!. And the potholes! I thought I bottomed out the rental car twice. The spa is fair -- my massage was good -- but my facial, pedicure and maincure were barely adequate -- but if you are a big spa-goer who is used to first rate spa treatments, I'd pass on this spa and spend your time relaxing in the sun.

<Content>Great place for families! My husband and our four children ages 10-15 stayed here during spring break. The bay/beach area is perfect for children. There are no waves, since there is a break wall far out. The hotel offers snorkel equipment, kayaks and waterbikes. The area is calm and safe enough to let your kids use the equipment (all for a price) alone, as long as they can swim. The pool is beautiful with waterfall and swim up bar. There is also a hot tub. There is plenty of room on the beach, around the pool and in the hammock area to set up for your day. We stayed in the Villas and the rooms were roomy and the bathrooms recently remodeled (marble vanities, double sinks, sepate toilet area). There is also a separate pool and hot tub for the Villas which the kids went to only in the evening. The hotel food was average, but the beach/pool area more than made up for it. Service was excellent, rooms were cleaned everyday by 10:00am, and front desk, valet and bellhops were all polite, helpful and friendly! I would go back again in an instant!!

<Content>Perfect Location/Nice Place Your stay at the Caribe all depends which room you stay in. I read the reviews fearing we were going to be put in a moldy/dirty room, so I called a week before and requested to stay in the Honors Tower. Thank goodness they followed up on our request. It was a very nice room. It had a flat screen, a nice balcony, an awesome frameless, tile shower and a very comfortable king bed. It seems the garden rooms aren't as nice and may need rennovation.The lobby is gorgeous. The pool area is beautiful. The beach is the only private beach on the island for a hotel. The Olas spa was excellent! I had a facial.This hotel is a perfect location if you want to explore a bit. It is 12 minutes from the airport. It is 10 minutes from Old San Juan. 10 minutes from Condado and 15 minutes from Isla Verde. The cab fare gets very expensive so try the bus or walk. The bus is 50 to 75 cents, one way. The walk to Condado is about 20 to 25 minutes.Just a note, the whole island shuts down on Good Friday and Easter, so when you plan your vacation be aware.

<Content>Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Caribe Hilton This hotel was recommended to me by friends. I'll be back!I stayed in the Honors Tower, the first room I was taken to didn't have quite the view I was looking for - but the bellman and the desk people very quickly assigned me to another room. I believe it was an ocean deluxe.The view was astounding, I was able to see the pools, 2 old forts, the harbor  ocean all from my room  balcony. The sun came up on the side of the hotel where I was staying  I found myself getting up a couple of hours earlier than usual just to see the sunrise!Staff was friendly, helpful and courteous.Loved the pool area, the hammocks (be sure to put a towel down before laying on the hammocks in a bathing suit! I forgot  got rope burns on my back!)There is plenty within walking distance, and so much on the grounds of the hotel itself. It was a great central location, a short drive from Old San Juan. I could go on . . . but I would find myself wanting to hop back on a plane  check in!

<Author>McLeanMommy
<Content>Great Family Hotel My husband and I took our two oldest (of 4) children on a spring break trip to San Juan to enjoy the beach, learn some history, and practice our Spanish. The beaches of San Juan are comparable to those of southern (Miami) Florida, with nice sand and clear water. We experienced some of Puerto Rico's prettiest beaches on a day trip to the offshore isle of Culebra, which has little to recommend it other than its beautiful sand and waters.San Juan's history -- especially the old Spanish fortifications -- is interesting, if a bit underwhelming. The nearby rainforest of El Yunque National Park was certainly beautiful, though not quite as spectacular as I had expected. That said, both old San Juan and El Yunque offer quick, easy, and interesting diversions if you do not want to spend all day at the beach.The people of Puerto Rico were very kind and accomodating and one young man gave us a friendly and free ride back to San Juan from Fajardo (1 hour +) one disastrous evening (long story).When my husband and I travel without children we stay at the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton and Mandarin Oriental hotels, so we are accustomed to good hotels. However, when we travel with our kids we try to stay at hotels that have nice pools, good activities and a lot of space. The Hilton El Caribe was wonderful on all counts.The rooms themselves are best described as perfectly standard and good business-class hotel accomodations. Our room -- a King Garden Suite (# 843) -- consisted of two connecting rooms. Each room had its own entry door, work area, mini refridgerator, safe, telephone, television and balcony. The main room had a king-size bed (quite comfortable), a full bathroom (standard), and a spacious and separate entry foyer. The second room had a full-size, pullout sofabed and a half bathroom. Pleasantly, our rooms had views of the old Fort San Geronimo (on site) and the ocean, and importantly, we experienced absolutely no daytime or evening noise.The El Caribe's grounds are quite lovely and especially fun for kids. There is a large main pool, subdivided into separate pool areas with waterfalls, or a basketball hoop, a bar, or hot tubs. The Condado Villas have a separate, more secluded and smaller pool area with its own hot tub. We generally retreated to that pool area to relax at the end of the day.The hotel has a private, man-made beach with fronts a clear, calm and small little inlet. The calm, inlet ocean water has waterslides and you can rent little boats.In addition, the El Caribe's grounds have a large carp, goldfish and koi pond. There are basketball and shuffleboard areas. There is a small children's playground. There is a pier where you can feed and observe fish in the open the ocean day or night. There are chessboards and other outdoor games scattered throughout the place. For adult relaxation, there is a nice health club, outdoor morning yoga classes, three outdoor bars, lounge chairs everywhere (on the beach, by the pool, facing the ocean pier) and hammocks in a lovely grove of palm trees. The is an onsite rental car agency (Hertz), and travel tour company (didn't use it).Finally, the El Caribe has many on-site restaurant choices (though we usually went offsite), including the truly good and relaxing Lemongrass, as well as a Starbucks coffee, Morton's steak house, Madrid tapas, and a standard hotel restaurant which hosts a breakfast buffet (kids are free) and dinner every day.The hotel's location is convenient, fifteen minutes to the airport and five minutes to Old San Juan. In short, the Hilton El Caribe -- opened as the El Caribe in 1949 -- is as good a place to stay in San Juan as any, especially with children. I would certainly stay there again if I ever return to San Juan.

<Content>One star room in 5-star surroundings First of all, I will state up front that I booked this hotel room through Hotwire. Because I know I am paying possibly the lowest rate in the entire hotel (which was still quite a bit of money), I don't expect the best room they have. However, I do expect to have a room at the quality level that they have promised Hotwire (which was 4 stars). I have used Hotwire on quite a few other occasions, and this has never been a problem before now. People reading this review should know that I am not one of those TripAdvisor members that appear to be chronic complainers; I don't like to let minor annoyances or inconveniences ruin my vacation, and this is the first negative travel review that I have ever written.My family and I arrived at the Hilton Caribe and I was extremely impressed by the gorgeous grounds and the beautiful lobby. An employee offered us complimentary chilled bottles of water as we checked in. I made a mental note to tell my father, a Hilton Honors Diamond level member, that this might be the place he may want to spend some of his accumulated points.Then we were shown to our room. My jaw dropped. This is a four-star hotel room? Frankly, I have had Motel 6 rooms that were nicer. The seams in the carpet were raveling. The curtain rod for the sheers had pulled out of the drywall and was hanging cock-eyed. While the view contained some lovely tropical plants, it was primarily of a side of a building covered by rust stains and dripped paint. Even though the square footage of the bathroom was rather large, it only contained a tiny, fiberglass modular shower unit (no tub) and a stand-alone single vanity. Both of them looked like very cheap Home Depot cash-and-carry fixtures. If were were staying more than one night, and my family hadn't been exhausted from our travel, I would have asked for a different room. I joked to my husband that this was probably not the room Paris stays in when she visits this hotel!I should also add that my room was accross the hall from a room that had the ice machine and the service elevator. The door to this room had extremely squeaky hinges (do they not have WD-40 in Puerto Rico?), and all night long I was treated to the loud squeaking of the door hinges and the dinging of the service elevator whenever it reached our floor (which, being the main floor, was often.).Let me say that the facilities are beautiful. This hotel is out on a nice point of land, and they have a gorgeous pool area and a beach that has a reef further out that calms the waves before they hit the swimming area.Besides the Starbucks(for breakfast the next morning). the only meal that we ate there was lunch at their outdoor bar and grill. Warning: if you are watching your budget, pay attention to your beverages. Our family had a meal of 3 chicken tender baskets, a hot dog, 2 pina coladas, 2 virgin pina coladas, and 4 soft drinks, and the bill before tip was $92.00. Turns out that that the virgin pinas were $7.50 each (they only charge you a buck more for the booze) and the cokes were $3.25 each . I realize that this is the typical prices one pays at a big-city Hilton, but they were the highest by far I had paid for drinks anywhere else in the Caribbean. I guess that going forward, I am going to have to decide whether to look cheap and ask the drink prices ahead of time or just order with my fingers crossed and hope for the best.My advice? This looks like a nice place to stay if you get a good room (I'd ask to see it first, and make sure it is in one of the newer buildings) and you can afford it. The next time we are in San Juan, our family will be exploring other options.

<Content>Expensive but enjoyable We stayed at this hotel 2 nights before a cruise and enjoyed our stay. The price is quite steep at $270 night base rate but we did like the room and setting very much.Having read mixed reviews on this web site after we booked, we did call the hotel several days in advance directly as I have allergies and was concerned about getting a damp or mildewed room after seeing some reviews which mentioned this. We mentioned that fact to the clerk. Perhaps that accounted for the fact that when we went to check in the clerk told us we had been upgraded to a room in the tower on the top floor. It was a very nice room with a great balcony view. We enjoyed the small beach they have and spend most of one day just being there and in the pleasant water....much nicer beach than that of the Marriott which has big waves and wasn't very clean or pleasant to be in. The Hilton had a nice quiet beach with no wave action. Very nice just to float on the peaceful waters. The grounds are very nice too. Pools are attractive but not connected so you really have 3 small/medium size pools right next to each other. Lots of people all over encamped in beach chairs. Food was expensive so we ate breakfast both mornings at the small health food cafe at the spa area which is not as pricey. Spoke to 3 different concierges and all were helpful.

<Content>Real relaxation Stayed mid-March with my teenage daughter for 5 days and booked a Spa Package. The manicure, pedicure, facial and massage were a definite treat. As HH members, we had an Executive Tower room, which was very nicely appointed. The staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful, especially with restaurant reservations. A definite bonus was the use of the Executive Lounge with complimentary snacks and beverages and free Internet (15 minutes pp). I was a bit disappointed that the HH Lounge had a cash bar. I've been to other Hiltons where they offered free cocktails. Yes, the $$ spent on cabs to and from Old San Juan added up, but the total was comparable to a car rental ($45 /day). We also used the gym (also nice). We had coupons for the breakfast buffet (great), lunch in the Olas Health Bar and a light supper in the Madrid Tapas Bar. Otherwise, we dined in Old San Juan and Condado. Try Ra铆ces for native cuisine. Overall, this was a relaxing getaway that perfectly suited our needs.

<Content>room problems, great pool and grounds We stayed in a room with a great view over looking the ocean and pool area. The room itself smelled damp and extremely musty. Even with the sliding door open to the balcony the smell stayed. The bathroom tub did not drain after one shower, we had 4 of standing water, the towel bar was hanging, our bed was not made as it should have been. We only had a bottom sheet and a bedspread - no top sheet or blankets. We called maintenance to fix the bathroom before 5 pm saying we would be out for dinner and if possible please fix while we were out. We came back at 8 and nothing was done. I had to call again and they came up within a half hour. They fixed the bathtub drain, the towel bar and remade the bed properly. Upon checking in the people at the front desk were great. Upon checking out early on Saturday the person at the front desk totally ignored me for at least 5 minutes - he should be fired. When I complained about the room all he said was sorry to hear that. This hotel seems to spend a lot of time keeping up the outdoor area which is fantastic.

<Content>mostly pleasant We stayed at the Caribe Hilton for three nights, 3/15-18. We have concluded that room assignment is highly variable and a big determinant of how reviewers have rated the hotel. We spent our first night in the main building. Had we been forced to stay in that room- our trip would have been VERY disappointing. Old, worn, dated, cracks, etc. I would expect more from a Motel 6! Fortunately- we moved to the Honors Tower. Beautiful! And- since we were on the side facing Old San Juan and the ocean- it was very quiet... we did not hear ANY construction noise. It is unfortunate that within the same resort there is such variability in the quality of rooms, noise level, quality of concierge service, bar service, etc. In one case the concierge was very helpful... when someone else was at the desk- it might as well have been vacant, since NO real assistance was provided. Housekeeping was adequate- but they removed my towel which was hanging on the bathroom door hook (a chamois I bring when I travel since I often react to the detergents hotels use). Management did nothing and did not return our calls to discuss a resolution. Bell service was OK- but they store luggage in a roped area of the open air lobby... not secure at all! On the positive side- the beach area is NICE! It was a pleasant haven- quieter than around the bar area and much less windy. We thoroughly enjoyed Lemongrass and Madrid-San Juan. Drink service was a mixed bag... SLOW service and not necessarily tasty pina coladas- which originated at this hotel!Overall we had a nice time in SJ and plan to return... we will likely stay elsewhere- ESJ, Ritz Carlton or the Westin. We were unable to fit in a trip to the rainforest so we'll likely stay closer to that area than Old San Juan next time.

<Content>Food not great The hotel is family orientated..alot of small children everywhere..the food was awful.. We booked a king suite it was awful, dirty couch and when I pulled the bedspread down it was dirty with spots on it. I went to the lobby and complained and they changed our room to a king deluxe because they did not have anymore suites. The room they gave us was in the tower and it was beautiful down comforter great view but the bathroom had a whole in the floor.The beach is small but the swim up bar was fun..the area is close to old San Juan a 12.00 cab ride away..If your looking for beach and inclusive go further south...I would not stay here again.

<Content>Great location and amenities but a tired hotel The location was fantastic (and beautiful) and the amenities were great (nice beach, pools, restaurants) but the hotel was poorly maintained. Chipped paint on the door frames, garbage remained in the can near the elevator for days, light bulbs remained burned out in the lobby bathroom. Disappointing for $350 per night.

<Content>Avoid until construction is done I've been to this hotel before and liked it in the past. As other reviewers have pointed out, the location is amazing, given the hotel's private beach and that it is much closer to old san Juan than similar beachfront hotels in Isla Verde. However, the Caribe Hilton is in the midst of constructing a new addition and it is VERY LOUD (from around 7 am to 6 pm). There are many hotel rooms that are affected by the noise. Being awoken by construction noise, being unable to use the patio, and not being able to take an afternoon nap all negatively affected my attempt to have a relaxing vacation at the Caribe Hilton.

<Content>Nice - but Nickel and Dimed Overall, this is an above average hotel, but the bill was truly a nickel and dime experience. A daily resort fee of $20+ was added with occupancy taxes for added insult. When I went in person to the business center to complain that I couldn't seem to get Internet access via the room's modem, the gentleman politely ushered me into a room with access. Then, he charged me $5 for 15 minutes. Plus occupancy taxes! Private beach was great, ocean views are great, location is great. Service was good, but not 5 star. The Hilton is literally right next door to the Normandie, so I explored that hotel for comparison and would say the Hilton's amenities appear much better (beach, swimming pools, restaurants, etc.). Only real bad news was that there was some type of raw sewage pouring out from the driveway on more than one day - not appetizing if you are about to spend $$$ at Morton's Steakhouse. Instead, head up the street to El Hamburguer for the best $3 burger on the planet.

<Content>Perfect Location Beautiful Spot If you are going to stay in or near San Juan this the hotel to stay in...Worth every penny..It has its own beach, a clean calm lagoon which is great for kids, (95% of the hotels in San Juan area do not have their own beach, they use public access beaches which are ok but not great) a very good Gym, beautiful swimming pools. (.one with a swim up bar,) very good food, and nice rooms. The hotel bars are excellent..This is where the Pina Colada was invented back in th 50's..The staff is bend over backwards friendly...The rooms are on the small side but not that big a deal since the weather is the main attraction..Views are beautful..If you call ask about the executive lounge feature..It sounds hoity toity but actually it gives you lots of free food options..It might only come with certain floors so ask first how you can get this included with the room price Renting a car is not necessary, as cabs are the best way to go anywhere,.Bus service is non existent...Old San Juan is charming with cobble stone streets and an immense Fort..Beautful lit up at night..There are some eyesores in and around San Juan but if you look past them you will see a certain charm in this area...Try walking to the Coronada area to the east of the hotel along the water and you will find a couple of cafes that have waves that come right up to the windows. We ate breakfast there...Be prepared to spend money on food as this is expensive in this part of Puerto Rico...even just basic lunch food. is high..The Hilton actually had healthy lunch type food that was somewhat less expensive than a lot of the local eateries we tried..Good veggie food cooked by locals is in the Hilton Gym cafe which is hidden away for some reason by the tennis courts..Take a cab ride to Isle Verde one evening and walk through some mega expensive hotel lobbies like the El San Juan which is spectacular(with a casino) and the Ritz Carlton..Good Mexican food sports bar called Lupis in this area..If you like snorkling take the catamaran ( you can book this in the hotel lobby) tour..It goes to an unpopulated Island off the coast .. right out of a post card..Even if you don't snorkle, the ride is great. the water warm,,...

<Content>Great Experience We received this hotel for 75.00 a night for our precruise stay from Feb. 22-25, 07. (we were not tacked on any extra charges, like resort fees.) We arrived at 3, our room was ready right at 4:00. Very nervous as both workers at the desk kept saying oh what a wonderful room you got!! I told my husband I think they were trying to convince us it was a great room before we saw it!!!Well, It WAS a great room. We were in the Condado Villas. #7117. Kitchen, bath, king bed, beautiful big terrace with loungers and boy what a view!!! Thought maybe we would get a lousy room since got it so cheap--glad I was wrong. Very clean room, great maid service.Only one problem, our safe wouldn't work, needed a new part, and Carlos fixed it right on the spot!!!!!!!Food is high priced, but the day we were on the beach, my husband and I split a hamburg and fries. They were huge so we had plenty.The garden rooms hallway smelled musty. The rooms looked ok, but I would have been disappointed if we would have gotten one. No view either.Did not ever eat supper there, went to town. The bus is easy to use for only 1.75. We had breakfast at the Subway right out the front of the hotel. Pancakes, breakfast sandwiches, french toast. and the right price!!!!I would definitely stay here again, and we loved our 3 day stay!!!!

<Content>Enjoyed the Caribe Hilton Just spent 5 nights at the Caribe Hilton in Feb 2007. Overall we had a very good time. The staff is very nice and accomodating. The Spanish/Puerto Rican restaurant was excellent. The Buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurant was also excellent. The beach and pool were a lot of fun for the kids (and adults). However this is not a 5 star hotel. The rooms were a little run down. The refrigerator was not working and we were told that they are room temperature refrigerators by the staff. This is laughable and unacceptable for a resort hotel in 2007. Nevertheless I would stay there again.

<Content>Screaming Kids, High Prices, Poor Service  I spent two nights in the Caribe Hilton and was quite disappointed. I booked an executive level room and expected to stay on the executive level. Upon check in, I was put on a standard floor (6th floor) instead of the executive level floors 9th and 10th. When I asked why they said that the hotel was fully booked. I later found out that they will sell an executive level room to anyone that is willing to pay an extra $100 dollars and then stick you in a normal room with access to the executive level lounge. The room that I was given on the 6th floor was noisy, dirty and quite old looking. The bathroom had rust stains all over the bath tub, walls and plaster falling from the ceiling. The carpet is well worn and needs to be replaced. When I got into the bed I discovered someone else鈥檚 hair on the sheets (Disgusting). When I tried to fall asleep I was kept awake by noise coming from the room above me. After I complained twice to the desk the hotel security finally took care of the problem. The next morning when I went to the executive level lounge for breakfast I was greeted with utter chaos. There must have been 150 people in an executive level lounge made to hold 25 people at the most. In addition to that there were plenty of screaming kids running around making lots of noise (I thought this was supposed to be an executive level lounge not a day care center). The breakfast selection was lacking. I also later found out that the complimentary beverages during happy hour are no longer complimentary (Cash Bar). This is the first executive level lounge that I have ever been in that charges you for a beer.The pool area is probably the high light of this hotel. Nice large pools and a beach area. The only downside is a million screaming kids. Service at this hotel is definitely lacking. The staff is very slow and makes no effort to help you. Just to get a waiter to take your order can take upwards of 1 hour in one of the hotels restaurants.The bottom line:OverpricedPoor ServiceDirty Rooms that are falling apartScreaming kids Executive Lounge is a ripe-offThe next time I鈥檓 in San Juan I will stay at the Ritz Carlton

<Content>Ritz prices for lacklustre service I agree with the prior review. We also stayed in the Lagoon Villas at the recommendation of the hotel as we explained before hand we were a family and needed space. The rooms were NY boutique small. The prices are very high for what you get. We were quoted $265 a night but after taxes and valet parking fee it was closer to $399 a night. Plus we found out people at the same rate had breakfast included while we were charged $20 per person for the buffet. Add that in and you are well over $400 per night for what is a very crowded and understaffed mid range hotel. We had no movie service in our room the entire stay despite reporting it daily to the front desk and the malfunctioning electronic rooms keys were a common pain for everyone. All the restaurants on the property are expensive for the quality.On the plus side the staff/people are friendly, it has a great location and its close to Old San Juan. The concierge desk is overworked but very useful and the free wireless network access at the in premises Starbux a bonus!

<Content>A great concept, but is it worth the money? We spent two nights at the start of a week in Puerto Rico in February, with two pre-teen children. It's a handsome place, nicely conceived and beautifully set--we wanted to be near Old San Juan. But for the prices at high season we would have expected better. The room, in the newest wing (Lagoon Villas) was attractive, but far too crowded for the price, and there was inadequate closet space for two people much less four. We wanted to eat at the chic Asian-fusion Lemongrass restaurant, set in one of the courtyards by our wing, but it was booked for a private party (a wedding reception), which went on and on very loudly, keeping us all up until (get this!) the cops shut it down way after midnight. The pools are lovely, and the beach is nice (for play, not for anything else); and we found all of the service very nice, if not always very efficient. I wouldn't have minded any of the problems had we not been paying enormous prices (as high as Disney World--where you get your money's worth).

<Content>Caribe was great The Caribe is a big hotel, and a good location if you want close access to the airport and old san juan. I visited with my wife and two kids, 9 and 12.For the kids, I think this is a really fun spot, since they have a nice pool complex, and easy access to the ocean. You can snorkel in the bay, see some cool fish, or just stay closer to shore near the water toys. The pool complex might get boring after 3 or 4 days, but otherwise it is nice. The Caribe has a ton of loungers all over the beach complex, close to pools, to beach, to palm trees, etc. and that variety was great.For my wife and I, we liked the broad range of restaurants on site. They are expensive, so we liked to take our time, which doesn't always work with kids. Fortunately, my kids were happy to get take-out Subway grinders and eat in the room watching disney channel movies, which is a rare treat for them. This freed up my wife and I to enjoy a 2 hour meal right on the hotel grounds. Our favorite was Lemongrass, since it is set in the garden and perfect for outdoor dining.The staff at the business center were very accomodating and proficient. The concierge staff certainly tried hard, but my experience was mixed, since once they sent us to a local museum without noticing that the museum wasn't open on that day. The room decor, at least in the garden wing, felt dated, but housekeeping kept it tidy.

<Content>Decent Hotel BUT THE SERVICE STINKS My wife and I went down for the Presidents Weekend the hotel was great until Saturday when EVERYONE else showed up. Lots of kids and folks from the New York (The Island). The room (Garden) they gave us first smelled real bad and we complained and the Manager upgraded us ASAP. The pools were wonderful and the beach area was ok. They need to rake the sand to get the cigarette butts, condom and trash picked up. The food was fair and expensive but one expects that at a resort like this. Hit the market outside the hotel for drinks and snacks. Also, use the Villa鈥檚 pool and hot tub, more adults and fewer kids. The pool bar was fun; Hector makes a mean Run Runner. The service / wait staff are SLOW!!! They know they have you and they take thier sweet time...Overall, it was fun however get a Villa room鈥?br/>

<Content>A+ for Paris' Dad You can look at this hotel in a couples of ways that can sway your star rating but here are a couple of observation I had when my husband and I traveled to the caribe hilton earlier this Feb.1. Your best bet for a relaxing vacation is always choosing the best room you can get. (remember this resort is one of the oldest in san juan...so new areas have been built some rooms upgraded and redesigned...you can have a low floor, high floor) I think the rooms can vary at caribe hilton this can sway your rating....our room was great with great view2. Your in san juan area if your looking just to stay on el caribe premisses that have a little built up laggon area, a number of pools, a shopping plaza with a starbucks, clothing, shoes....so if you really want to stay put you could....but most people I would believe want to venture ot to old san juan or condado area....to see the scene or possilbly to go to a casino....in the neighboring area of condado...most of those hotels have them...el condado, marriott...etc...you could actually walk there but the bridge that connects caribe hilton area with condado area is a little dark at night to cross...i would cab it3. food there is a mortons on premises....also hilton breakfast buffet...was ok......if you not a morning person ...you can just goto starbucks...but if you plan on eating breakfast everyday try to get breakfast included...could be pricey if you don't.4. the hotel staff were excellent and there advice ...right on the money....they told us to go to a place for seafood named aquaviva in old san juan...when we were about to go exploring...the place was yummy...cerviche great...so were the oysters rockafeller...we even got to see an equestrian street show (just happened to be going on the weekend we visited) hole thing was delightful...we stumbled on a place called ropa vieja while walking in condado...was a great dinner!!!!5. the pools were clean and beautiful....be careful who you sit next to though....one women was on her cell loudly...talking about her stupid haphazard posting of her CV on monster.com...yap yap...and how she was getting job offers...new york ...penn....NJ...if your reading this and this was you....women you got to learn to be discreet...you were too...loud...we didn't need to know your business but man we had no chioce....lol...(sorry I got off track :o) back to my review): 6. Bar areas.....very nice.....even to just check out....big screen tv indoors near main lobby...great......live music....greatwe didn't mind paying for our liquor (were from NY and bars can be pricey)BUT so people doing this (tip: drinks expensive: Get plastic cups from bar (buy a drink, keep cup) then store bears liquor in your room that you bought from airport or from shops, groceries stores (not many in the area so try to find some when your getting there or out and about otherwise you will need transportation to get to a place that has it at a good price). 7. Great location-If you stay in isla verde where a majority of the hotels are....you will have to deal with the noise of the airport...very very loud I saw reviews where for a couple of seconds you can't hear your own conversations......caribe hilton was in a perfect location....further away from airport.....only heard prop planes from small airport in the area and that was occasional.8.Room service -yummy9. history - this hotel has history...thats why the have so much grounds becuase they had this area for so long...most hotels don't have so much area---as you can tell by the fort on the premisses with nice views of ocean crashing on rocks...there is a view of the lagoon...there is a small beach area...very diverse...the grounds are well kept and they have a beautiful veranda area with swans...very peacefulThis hotel definetly is what you make of it and your trip...If you get a nice room, happen to have great weather and go exploring...youll get the best out of this hotel...Happy travels!!!! Hasta la vista!!!!

<Content>Great Day Place We just returned from a 2 day stay and we were very pleased!The locaction-in the daytime cannot be beat! We are Hilton Honers and were using our points for a wonderful room-inthe towers witha partial ocean view. The bed was extremely comfortable. The pool was wonderful. The beach was beautiful. The reasurants were not good! The lunch was awful-I was scared to eat it and I was very hungry. There is nothing to do at night-you have to take a cab to town.This was a great day place.

<Content>Beautiful views, so-so service, 'cruise-shippy' First off, I should make a disclaimer...we're not resort/cruise people; we love small boutique hotels and tend to be a bit biased against big resort properties. Still, I think we could both see the virtues and faults of the Caribe Hilton (and this was only 2 nights of a 2-week Carribean vacation). We picked it because I have oodles of Hilton points from business travel and we were attracted to the location between Old San Juan and Condado, the two areas where we were considering staying.The hotel gave us a very nice ocean-facing room with a balcony (perhaps because of my diamond status with Hilton.). The room was clean and seemed recently renovated. The beds were extremely comfortable. The A/C was way too cold, and despite changing the thermostat, it only seemed to stop cranking out cold air when we turned it all the way off. The view of the ocean, Fort San Geronimo, and over to Condado was spectacular. The hallways, on the other hand, had a fair amount of peeling paint, etc. Perhaps more renovations are on their way?The setting is beautiful... a scenic beach (on a lagoon, not the open ocean), lots of palm trees, a curvy walkway along the ocean's edge, etc. Adjacent Fort San Geronimo added a nice touch to our view. Too bad it seems to be permanently closed. Despite the beautiful location, the overall atmosphere is way to cruise-shippy for our tastes (shuffleboard, etc.). As soon as the sun came down each night, the bar (located in the open-air lobby) featured a loud lounge singer and back-up musicians whose Vegas-meets-Carribean sound echoed throughout the lobby and outdoor areas).The location--which we had predicted would be a key positive aspect--was in some ways minus. Although it's between Old San Juan and Condado, it's actually a bit far of a walk to either, requiring a $20 taxi (for about a 2 mile trip?!!) to get to most restaurants and nightlife. The sheer size of this sprawling complex--a plus for many, I'm sure, was a bit of a minus for us. It made us feel a bit detached from the rest of the city.The service was mixed. While we were waiting in the long Hilton Honors check-in line, a helpful staff member directed us to another check-in location, at the HHonors tower (named as an attempt to make us feel special, I suppose). The service was incredibly slow at the bars and restaurants. We ordered food service on our first night. Don't do it! Our chicken quesadilla was late, cold, flavorless, and overpriced. The executive lounge had a great view, but was packed at breakfast and the staff couldn't keep up with clearing dishes and replenishing supplies. They also cleared all of the food out immediately at 11 am (closing time), which we found particularly annoying since we had spent the last 15 minutes chasing down staff to replenish the already near-depleted supply of food as well as bowls and plates to put the food on.The concierge was very helpful in providing us info and restaurant reservations. The turndown service was also a nice extra--not something I've found at most Hiltons.We'll probably pick somewhere else when we return to San Juan, but wouldn't be totally adverse to staying at the Caribe Hilton again to save money by using Hilton points (We were not particularly interested in the other Hilton family hotels in San Juan, since they are all loacted in Isla Verde--near the airport, an area of less interest to us.). The comfortable room and beautiful setting were the main plusses. I would not plan to have any meals there, though.

<Content>Good location but poor service We stayed overnight at the San Juan Caribe Hilton on January 21, 2007. We were leaving on a cruise the next day. When we arrived at the hotel at 2:00 pm San Juan time, we were told that our room was not ready and that check in time was between 4:00 and 6:00 pm but that we could leave our luggage and wait in the lounge if we chose. We were starving so we went to the restaurant and literally stood there waiting for someone, anyone, to seat us. One of the already seated customers commented to us that it was the worse service she had ever seen. After going into the restaurant and hunting down a waiter and asking to be seated, we were told someone would be with us shortly. The restaurant was only about a third occupied. After being seated, we then waited for someone, anyone to take our order. Finally someone arrived and thirty more minutes later our sandwiches arrived. It was not just a one time occurance. We actually tried the restaurant again for lunch the next day and after waiting over 20 minutes for someone to take our order, after having asked for assistance, we got up and left. We went back to the service desk at 4:05 pm and were told that our room still was not ready. That sent my husband, a Hilton Honors member over the edge. He asked to speak to the manager and suddenly a room managed to be ready. Then we waited 2 more hours for our luggage to be sent to the room. It was only after we went back down to the bell station and reminded them that they had said they would deliver the luggage over 2 hours ago that they got around to getting it to the room. The room was in the remodeled tower of the hotel. The bed was comfortable. We had no washcloths in the bathroom. The pool area was nice and well kept. The service was deplorable. For a hotel as expensive as the Caribe, I expected much better.

<Content>Great Getaway We spent six days here and found the property to be an all-inclusive getaway. We stayed in the Villas, which are not villas, but a new wing of the hotel. The room was great, with a nice balcany overlooking the ocean. The beach was great, good snorkling and calm, clear waters.Would reccomend this place if you really want to relax and not want to explore the island.

<Content>mixed review A group meeting brought us to this hotel during the third week of January. I was a bit concerned about the stay having read previous reviews which were very mixed. First the bottom line. We have a very nice stay at the hotel but the room quality is definitely a potential issue. We arrived in the early afternoon and were assigned a room in the newly renovated tower. The air conditioning did not work well and there was no way to change it (preset at the high 60's F). The toilet leaked around the base, the balcony door had no lock, and there was a strange wire protruding from the floor by the balcony door. We were given a different room and everything was fine. As noted by others the beds are wonderful. This time the air conditioning (still preset) worked fine. The flat-screen TV was a nice touch. The remainder of our stay from a room standpoint was fine but you shouldn't have this kind of issue with a multi-star Hilton resort and if we'd arrived later in the day our room options would have been more limited. Food at the restaurant and elsewhere in San Juan is expensive unless you stay away from the restaurants frequented by tourists. You can easily spend $50 per person without drinks. On the other hand, I did grab lunch on the run at the Subway across the street one day for around $8.00. All in all, the location is not bad (a short cab ride into old San Juan) and aside from the initial room issues, I have no complaints. But....for the price and the hotel name we shouldn't have had the problems we did. Would I stay at this hotel again? Probably not since there are many 'name brands from which to choose.

<Content>So-So Resort My husband and I stayed at the Caribe Hilton for 7 days. We were looking for a resort experience with the option to visit Old San Juan easily. While this resort had both of these, it was not special in any way.1) The room. The room which we reserved was in the Garden Tower. This tower is 8 stories and all rooms have a vew overlooking the birdsanctuary and if you are high enough, the ocean. While the view was lovely, the room was terrible. We should have known there was a problem when we opened the door and it was mildly warped. The room was damp and mildewy. Even the carpet was damp. It seems that our door to the balcony did not seal and the island humidity had gotten the best of our room. The hotel let us switch to the newer Tower that was recently renovated. It still had a view of the ocean but everything was dry and there was no musty odor. I suspect all of the Garden rooms are mildewy and would avoid that area.2) Restraunts. Not worth it. They are overpriced and the menus are not innovative. We wanted to eat at the resort but everytime we reviewed the menu, we were not inspired. There is so much fantastic food on the island, why waste time at a poor restraunt.3.) Water. The beach is pleasant enough with plenty of lounge chairs. There is a spot for everyone: the tanner, the relaxer, the family, the stay in the shade. However, don't bother renting the snorkel equipment as what remains of the coral in the area is near dead. The ocean, though clear, is too murky for snorkeling and there are not many fish in that area. The best place for viewing fish on the resort is at the fish feeding pier.We had a pleasant time as it was the closest resort with a beach to Old San Juan. However, we would not visit this resort again.

<Content>Caribe Hilton is Great My husband and I stayed at the Caribe Hilton last March for 4 nights with another couple and we had a fantastic time. We were a bit sceptical reading all of the reviews but we would definetely return.The hotel:The hotel is wonderful. It's located just a few minutes from the San Juan International airport. You wouldn't expect to see such a beautiful resort in the location but you'd be surprised. The open air lobby and and birds were such a nice touch. The lobby bar is quite trendy and a great place to end the evening. There are different areas to the hotel, execuitve and villas, and main area. We stayed in the Villas (not Villas at all), just a standard room which was quite small, but new and clean. Our view overlooked construction in the city but did not put a damper on the vacation at all.The pool  beach:The pool area was great and nicely landscaped. The property is on it's own secluded beach. But if you are looking for tropical blue water and white sand don't look for it here. It's a man made beach much like a lagoon, reminded me lot of a lake in NH. But none the less we enjoyed it very much because I was already aware of this when we booked our trip.The price was great and included breakfast buffet which was excellent. We didn't eat at any of the restaraunts for dinner because we wanted to venture out to the local places. There is however a few options including a Mortons and Lemon grass (which is surrounded by lush grounds and tropical birds).The area of San Juan is City like and very different from other areas we have been to in the Caribbean. But we would definetely return and opt to stay in the Hilton. I am a travel agent and saw many of the properties in the Condado area and a few nearby in Old San Juan. While there were other very nice properties in the area we would most likely return to the Hilton.Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or if you need any assistance planning your future trip. kmitchell@tripguy.com

<Content>Timing is all We were at the Caribe Hilton in the post-New Year lull and at mid-week, and couldn't have found the service more gracious and helpful and smiling, nor the hotel more pleasant. The gardens and views of the 16th-century Spanish ruins that frame the property are stunning, and the grounds, well-shaded by palms and cooled by ocean breezes, were perfect for relaxing with a book in a hammock. The spa services are a plus and most of the restaurants about what you'd expect of a hotel chain resort hotel--with the exception of Lemon Grass, a jewel of a little Latino-pan-Asian restaurant, almost hidden in a tropical garden, where we ate some of the most delicious food we've ever eaten. (I had a dream about the homemade orange-ginger-cardamom ice cream). (It's a splurge and you'll need to book ahead, but Lemon Grass is well worth it). For real San Juan and authentic Puerto Rican food, the old city is a very short cab ride away, and taxis are always available. Be sure to try the little family-run La Fonda del Jibarito on Calle Sol for delicious local specialties. My main advice would be to avoid this hotel at over-crowded times like Christmas, New Year, and spring break weeks.

<Content>Food Poisoning My family of 10 stayed at the Caribe Hilton for 2 nights before our criuse and 1 night after, which happened to be New Year's Eve. The Caribe Hilton is nice, but don't expect a sprawling resort like you get elsewhere in the Carribean. The resort itself consists of the buildings, a small garden, a nice pool and a small beach. It would probably take you only 5 minutes to take a tour of the whole place. It's surrounded by other large hotels and resorts. There's not a lot to do at the hotel due to the size. The beach is nice, but crowded, the pool was chilly and the hot tubs were jammed with kids. On our second night there my entire family ate at the buffet. They had a salad bar, taco stations, and desserts. At 4am the next morning both my brother and my neice woke up with horrible cases of food poisoning. We're not sure what they both ate, but we think it was the salad bar since my neice is a vegetarian and my brother is not. They both were completely incapacitated the next day. We alerted the hotel and they denied all responsibility. My mother had to call a doctor because they were both so ill. The doctor came to the resort and said he was stopping by numerous rooms to treat people with food poisoning. The hotel continued to deny all responsibility and made us pay the $300+ doctor bill. My mother requested a late checkout for my brother's room so we could take him straight to the cruise (we didn't want him to not have a bed and bathroom for a few hours) and the hotel gave it to him, but charged us. They even charged us for the dinner that made everyone sick! Once on the cruise we met several other groups who had the same situation at the Caribe Hilton. My neice recovered in a couple of days, but my brother was sick the entire week.All in all I wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Generic, Bland, Characterless - As Far from Puerto Rico as Possible! Staying at the Caribe Hilton is like staying in Puerto Rico while being completely insulated from the island's magical flavor or culture. The feel was that of any generic chain resort in Florida or South Padre Island Texas, except that it cost 2-3 times a much, making Florida a much better value. We stayed there six nights around New Year's, and will not repeat the experience. It was like being on a cruise ship full of pushy tourists aggressively trying to squeeze out the maximum bang from their buck (imagine hordes of people tripping frantically over each other at 8AM to bag lounge chairs at the beach/pool area ... let's dump one shoe on this chair, one on the next, a towel on the next one, a magazine on the next, the guest services directory on the next ... you get the picture). As Gold HHonors members we had access to the executive lounge, where it was like pigs at the trough ... everytime a new platter of desserts or fruit or sandwiches came out, everyone rushes in to grab what they can. The front desk, belldesk, guest services, and concierge staff were totally disorganized (concierge put us on hold indefinitely on three occasions), harried-looking, and not too friendly (the last being totally uncharacteristic of the island). In fact, the local staff seemed to have had their Puerto Rican charm completely beat out of them, as if they were told to be as generic and robotic and culture-free as possible (like to give the impression of this is just like Omaha, honey!). The food at the restaurants was also completely generic, with precious little island flavor, and all the so-called local dishes we tried were completely watered-down versions (to quote Barbara Ehrenreich, like your regular Ohio cuisine with a tropical twist.) We ended up escaping into the city at regular intervals in order to avoid getting completely disheartened by how far this property is from everything that Puerto Rico represents (and also to meet some real locals and eat some real food). I think any of the hotels in the Condado or Old San Juan area would be much better bases for a tropical vacation with more Puerto Rican flavor ... the Caribe Hilton is as removed from the island as a cruise ship would be. Never again. Granted, the beach and pool area are nice, but one can get better beaches and better pools with far less crowds and at a fraction of the price in Florida. If one wants to go all the way to Puerto Rico, shutting oneself away in this generic, could-be-anywhere resort is a big mistake.

<Content>Sooo much better than the Normandie next door We followed up an AWFUL experience at the Hotel Normadie by checking into the Caribe next door. What a difference!I normally don't like chain hotels on the beach, but it was an oasis of quiet and calm with great amenitites--including a Starbucks, which somehow really hit the spot. Even the hotel restaurants were good and the service was friendly. I think if you want beach, stay further towards Isla Grande and if you want Old San Juan, stay closer to there, but the location is still good and it was a good experience.

<Content>Nice place, but very crowded We recently stayed at this hotel for one night, before our return home. We had originally booked the room for our first night in Puerto Rico, but our flight from the US was delayed. We were told by Expedia that our booking was non transferrable/refundable, but the hotel was understanding of our situation, which was out of our hands, and agreed to change our booking at no cost to us. What a relief!The hotel was nice, but very crowded. We waited quite a while to check in, only to find out that our room was not ready as promised. We were upgraded to a villa, which was lovely. Our villa neighbors were very noisy. Upon our complaint to the front desk, someone was sent to calm them down immediately and we had no further problems. I would probably look for a smaller, less crowded hotel the next time I am in San Juan, but the Hilton is lovely if you don't mind a crowd.

<Content>Beautiful Property-but don't eat there I stayed at the hotel with my boyfriend Dec 12th- Dec 16th. He was there for a conference so I sent alot of time by myself on the property. First, the pros. The property is beautiful, well kept. The housekeeping was excellent. I spent time at the pool, worked out at the gym and had no complaints in those areas. The service at the pool was friendly and efficient. Now to the cons, on the night we arrived we ordered room service, we needed to call room service not twice, not three times but FOUR times to pick up our tray. It sat outside of our room for 24 hours. We went to the Pan Asian restaurant for dinner the second night and were charged $9 PER GLASS for Pellegrino sparkling water. I live in NYC and dine at fine restaurants all the time. I thought that was a little on the ridiculous side. The last morning we were there, we had breakfast at the main restaurant and our eggs and oatmeal took 30 mintues to come out and when my eggs came out they were not made correctly. Stay in the hotel, but don't eat there is the moral here.

<Content>Stolen Wallet After our stay on December 23 to 24, 2006, we procceeded to pay the Parking fee at the Parking cashier's booth, just after paying, I got pick pocketed. I did not feel the move but later realized that it was a group job. A person with a very small cute dog distracted my family asking them to pet it as I payed. Some more distraction by a person in line right behind me, and woosh! my wallet disappered. On my way to the airport, calling the parking attendant booth did not provide any help, they refered me to hotel security, again, no help. They informed me that they have no cameras coveryng the parking booth area (?). Did not collect any info from me. -Local Police? Forget it! they're not even interested! I am still calling every day to ask if my wallet has been found. But with such an enthusiasm on their part, it seems I'm out of luck. --Never let your guard down.

<Content>Looks aren't everything I stayed here 12/19 and paid $65 on Priceline. I've been told there's absolutely no chance of upgrades when booking on Priceline and that I would be given the worst quality room. Luckily that wasn't true, and when I arrived I was given a room in the Condado Lagoon Villas.I was traveling with my mother, and she was shocked at how nice the room was after my repeated warnings that this may not be the greatest place due to what I paid for it. The room was large, we had a great view of the lagoon, and she took numerous pictures of the bathroom because she wants to model her own after it.The grounds are beautiful, and there is plenty to do on-site. The restaurants all sound and smell good but are a little pricey. Some menus don't have prices, the Italian restaurant averaged about $30-$40 for an entree, and Madrid-San Juan seemed the most reasonable, but of course it is a tapas place so most likely has small portions.We were very tired and didn't feel like getting ready to go out for dinner, so we ordered room service. I had the house salad, she had the Caesar, and we shared a margherita pizza. The house salad did not have croutons as described on the menu (I eat salad for the dressing and croutons, not the healthy stuff), and the croutons on the Caesar were tasteless and mushy. Other than that, the salads were very good. For some reason the pizza smelled like donuts, but it tasted like pizza and was surprisingly tasty. I also got the guava cheesecake which was fantastic. None of these things seemed too expensive on the menu, but after taxes and the automatic 15% gratuity, the total came to $56.39 which seemed a lot for what we got. But whatever.The main problems I had were in the bathroom. I turned one of the sinks on and left it running for a minute while I went to get some soap I had left by the bed. When I returned, the floor was covered in water due to leaky pipes. When I wiped it up with a towel, the towel ended up covered in brown dirt. I started checking other parts of the bathroom, and it seemed it was rarely cleaned. Also, throughout the room, there were black marks all over the floor and walls. It looked like crayons or scuff marks. Finally, there was a digital scale in the bathroom that didn't work! Now I certainly don't expect or care if there's a scale in my room, but what is the point of putting one in if it doesn't function?!Overall, the hotel, including the room I was in, was very beautiful, and the staff was all friendly and pleasant (contrary to what I expected from some of the reviews I've read), but they really ought to work a little harder on keeping the place clean and maintained. I've stayed in a lot of hotels, and cleanliness has never been an issue for me, so that part was disappointing. However, I would stay there again, especially at $65 a night!

<Content>Surprisingly very nice! We were there for only one night in one of the Lagoon Villa rooms. Very new and nice and comfortable. We had stayed at the Caribe Hilton about 6 years ago. Very much improved. Loved our short 24 hour stay but would do it again! Mortons in the hotel was good as well!

<Content>A Great Stay At The Hilton My wife and I just returned from a great six night stay at the Caribe. Check-in was painless. We received a free upgrade. The room was nice and clean with a great view. Self parking at the garage across the street was easy.We only ate breakfast at the hotel. As previously noted in other reviews, it's pricey but expected. The food quality was great.The hotel is a five minute drive to Old San Juan. Eric, the day Concierge is a great resource. The pools and beach were great. The exercise room at the spa was nice. Overall, a great visit. We'd definitley consider the Caribe for a future visit.

<Content>Fantastic Time! I had a fantastic time at this hotel! I have to admit I was leary after reading some of the other reviews on this site but went ahead with my plans! I am NOT sorry! The staff was super friendly and accomodating. Our room was clean and had a great view. You can walk right out the back door of the hotel and find the pool, the ocean, the bar..etc. I would highly recommend this to anyone!

<Content>Fantastic, cannot say enough good about it Got to the Caribe Hilton about 5 to check in. I cannot say enough about this property and how they treated us. Understand - I don't demand 5 star hotels, but this place was so beautiful and the staff was so nice and friendly. Here are the highlights:1. Since it was my birthday, they upgraded us to Rm 1558 in the tower. Newly remodeled with a view that was gorgeous overlooking the water and the Condado district. Corner room which was really nice. Had a huge marble shower with the rain shower heads. Beds so comfy you thought you died and went to heaven.2. My husband had called the hotel and asked to have a rose in the room for me for my birtday. They told him that is part of our service, and we will be happy to do that at no cost to you. So a rose was waiting for me with a beautiful note from the wonderful hubby telling me to have the time of my life.3. That evening, the staff brought up a small cupcake size birthday cake for me with Happy Birthday written on the plate. Very thoughtful.4. Hotel was beautiful, unbelievable clean, beach was wonderful. They were constantly cleaning.I honestly cannot say one bad thing about the hotel. I thought it was the best hotel I had ever been in. Food was good (expensive - but you expect that). We for the most part just vegged on the beach. Weather was fantastic, around 85-87 each day, just a couple little sprinkles once or twice. I would recommend this resort to anyone.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay at the Caribe Hilton Stayed one night post cruise. Main building 3rd floor. Room 318. I thought the room was just fine. Not a great view because we overlooked the roof of the main reservation area, but we were here only one night. The bed was extremely comfortable, the shower had plenty of hot water and water pressure. I did not have any type of smell in my room. The hallway smelled a tad musty, but it has to be because of all the moisture being right on the water.The pool, swim up bar and view of the ocean are just incredible.The pool area was not as clean as I would have expected from a Hilton property, but not disgusting. I don't know why people think it's ok to come from the beach into the pool to wash their feet. We smelled no odors while outside by the pool. (We had read and heard of this before. In fact, my husband was here last year and there was a very bad smell at that time out by the pool.We had drinks and ate burgers and appetizers at the swim up bar. the 8oz bacon cheeseburger with fries for $11 was very good. I thought $7 for a Corona and $3 for fountain cola was a bit pricey. We did not eat at the hotel. We went to Haceinda Don Jose for some great Mexican/Puerto Rican food instead.I liked the hotel enough that I would stay here again.Our main building room was fine, but my understanding is the Villa rooms are much nicer. We met a couple who were 1/2 thru a 2 week vacation that were initially in the Villa section but switched to the main building to be closer to everything. She said it took 15 minutes to walk from their Villa room to the main area of the hotel.

<Content>Very nice experience Just back from a stay in the Caribe Hilton, Stayed one night before a cruise and two nights after. On arrival it looked fantastic. Very inpressive. The reception area is huge and there is a fabulous view out to the sea. We booked a Dble Dble Deluxe ocean view room as there was 3 of us. We got our ocean view on both check ins, in different parts of the hotel, both rooms were more or less the same, I did expect better for a Hilton the walls looked as if the paper was peeling off in some areas and the carpet did look old, the bathroom was lovely and clean and the beds were very comfy. We were just a little dissapointed with the rooms, but for the amt of time you spend in your room... the gounds well made up for it. Pools and beach absolutely beautiful, looks exactly like the picture on their web site. We ate in Mortons Steakhouse which is on the premises, the meal was delicious. The steaks are hugh, well worth trying, but a little expensive. The price list is outside so you know what to expect before you go in. The staff were all lovely from reception to bell boys to pool tenders. No complaints there. Overall we had a great time in the Caribe Hilton.

<Content>Fantastic Private Beach and Grounds, Bad Food, Fair Rooms We stayed at the Caribe Hilton for 3-nights in February of this year prior to our cruise of the Panama Canal. Puerto Rico is not one of my favorite Caribbean destinations. At best, the locals tolerate the tourists. But, the Caribe Hilton is a very nice property. It has a beautiful little private beach, a scenic promenade that runs right next to the ocean, a nice pool area, a good gym, and good tennis courts with pros on staff for lessons. I took a tennis lesson while I was there. The pro was American, friendly, helpful, and a good tennis player.The property offers hotel rooms and villas. We had a hotel room. The room was okay, but there was evidence of deferred maintenance everywhere. There was a musky smell in the room. There are GIANT signs in the hallways asking the maids not to scream and talk loudly.The restaurants were very disappointing. We did not have one good meal there. The service was not good either. We took advantage of the little convenience store right across the street. We walked to El Morro and Old Town. You walk out of the property and turn right. The views of the ocean were magnificent. There were homeless people sleeping in old cars across the street. Old Town is very run down and in need of much repair. Half of the shops are empty. There is a new casino in Old Town that caters to the cruise ship crowd.In summery, the grounds of the Caribe Hilton are fantastic. They are private and that is very important in crime-ridden Puerto Rico. The rooms and service were both fair, and the food is not good. If I were ever to go back to Puerto Rico, I think I would search for a resort away from town and stay away from the ultra sleezy Condado area.

<Content>Some good, some bad My hubbie and I spent a few days prior to a work trip at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The location was great, not too far from Old San Juan and not to far from the new upscale developments either. Hubbie is a Hilton Honors Member so we were upgraded to a better than average room in the tower that had recently been upgraded. Upon first site the room seemed pretty nice but when you looked closer the wall paper was rotten and there was mold growing on the walls. All that had been updated apparently was the furnishings. The bath room was really nice, but it to had mold that was trying to peel off the fresh coat of paint. The service was really nice and the beach was decent. Overall it was a pretty good experience but not a top property.

<Content>had a great time! Let me tell you that my wife and I are from San Francisco, CA and this was our first time to Puerto Rico. Being the control freak that I am I researched multiple web sites reading all the reviews on Puerto Rico Hotels, ranging from 3 star to the highest priced hotels. Interestingly, I found no hotel that had a perfect score- there's always going to be some that have a problem with something. We were constrained to being close to the cruise ship, so I focused on the San Juan area. I saw lots of complaints about the Caribe, but enough good reviews to take a chance- that balanced with some of the photos people posted and the going prices at the time made it the optimal value/price ratio.We did opt for the ocean view and we did have a wonderful view of the bay. However, you could see the rooftop of the 1st floor structure and it had some noisy a/c equipment. We were on the upper level so it wasn't so bad and you couldn't hear it at all if the window was closed. The room did smell a bit moldy when we first came in - like the a/c filter hadn't been cleaned in a long time. But it went away after keeping it on for awhile and opening the window. The room was otherwise nice and clean, and the mattresses extremely comfortable- slept VERY well.But you shouldn't stay in your room- the Caribe has some wonderful facilities. The pool area is fantastic, with multiple levels. There is a pool bar that is interesting, but the drinks were so-so and a bit overpriced. The Caribe also has their own private bay and beach which is fantastic. My favorite part was all the hammocks under the palm trees- I took a nap there. That was heaven. Also a nice promenade that is right on the ocean.For eating, we tried the Spanish restaurant on the premises. I thought the food was quite good, but don't order cocktails- opt instead for a good Spanish wine as they don't do cocktails very well. The breakfast buffet is also very good and I liked the exotic fruit juices they had. Eat outside on the patio and watch the geckos go by- inside was a bit too cold for us. I wish we had tried the other restaurants, but ended up eating at Ramiros, which was highly rated but we found disappointing (except for the wine). Seems like a lot of people have problems with the service. We had none. In fact, I found the staff was very helpful and courteous and always available to answer questions. We also used the on-site tour shop to go to the rain forest. It was well run and we had a good time. However, we were at the Caribe in August which is off season. My feeling is that when the East Coast crowd shows up it takes on a different character. I can see if that place is packed with families how it could take on a more stressful atmosphere. I will stay here again if I come back to Puerto Rico.

<Content>Money Was Stolen and Management Did Not Care While staying at the hotel money was stolen from wallets hidden in drawers, and pockets of clothing. The management was very patronizing, and basically said that since the money wasn't in the safe they weren't responsible. The Security Dept. did a check and found that two employees had entered the room during the time we were gone but we were informed that since they did not know which employee may have taken the money and since we had left it unattended there was nothing they could do. They would just watch the employees in the future. It is important to note that a limited amount of money was taken from two wallets - leaving us to believe that the employees take smaller amounts so hotel guests won't notice the missing funds. The only reason we noticed is because one of the wallets was dropped on the floor. Don't go to this hotel - it is not safe!

<Content>Our room was robbed! My friend and I were celebrating our 50th birthdays, and stayed at the Caribe prior to our cruise. We went down to the pool for two hours and when we returned, found one of our wallets on the floor. Upon investigation, we discovered that we were robbed of approximately $300 in cash--from my friend's wallet hidden in a phone book in a table, my wallet in my purse, my pants pocket, and the small change and bills we had lying on the table.Hotel security conducted an investigation, including a door key computer printout, and said they would send the results. We had to BEG the manager to come up and give us new room keys and told him we did not want anyone to enter our room for the remainder of our stay. After waiting almost two months to hear from anyone at the hotel, I finally wrote to hilton and my letter was forwarded to the hotel. I received a letter from the assistant manager of security basically telling me too bad, so sad, we're not responsible. Oh, and that their employees are all monitored and have a security background check. Oh, and if I want to come back, they'll give me a room upgrade or a free dinner. A free dinner would have been nice after the theft occurred, but nothing was offered at the time.Because a couple of people entered our room while we were at the pool, they cannot pinpoint the thief, and therefore, no one is held accountable.So, if you don't mind an employee rummaging through your clothes and taking what they please, by all means stay at this hotel.I am a diamond member of Hilton, and a travel agent, and this is the first time in over 30 years of travel that my room has been robbed. My theory is that they are taking a little bit from each room and the guests aren't noticing. We only knew because they dropped one of the wallets on the floor. Lesson learned -- if this happens again, I will call the local police immediately.

<Content>Overpriced with Sub-Par Service My husband and I booked the Caribe Hilton for our destination wedding and while the catering department and our wedding planner did an excellent job with the actual wedding ceremony and reception, our stay and the stay of our guests at the hotel was not as pleasant. Indeed, many of us were surprisingly disappointed that a hotel bearing the Hilton name was such a let down. It was only after our stay did we learn that Hilton does not operate all of its hotels and some, including the Caribe Hilton, are run by other entities who are permitted to use the Hilton name. First, with respect to the quality of the rooms, you would expect more for what you are paying to stay here. A lot of the rooms were damp, with the sheets and walls feeling wet. There was also an odor- probably related to the dampness. Another issue was with the indifferent hotel staff, from the front desk to management. We had an incident with one of our guests' ring being stolen from their room, and after getting the runaraound, we were left with an uncooperative security personnel whose attitude was pretty much oh well- too bad. One of the biggest peeves was at check out. If you choose to stay here, be sure to get in writing what you will be charged up front. We never had the situation before our stay here where, on top of our regular room rate, there was such a siginifcant amount of additional daily fees tacked on on top of the regular taxes and fees you would normally expect. for example, the Caribe Hilton tacks on a hefty fee for transporting luggage to your room, EVEN IF YOU CARRIED YOUR OWN BAGS TO YOUR ROOM. They also charge a daily cleaning fee, a daily resort fee, and automatically add a donation to a charity you never heard of. Going over the final bill was quite a frustrating experience realizing that after having tipped all the hotel staff for their various services throughout the stay, we were being charged on top of that for their services which any normal person would assume is included in the rate (i.e. maid service, a resort fee for hanging out at the pool, having your bags brought up). We will never stay here again, and would NEVER recommend this place to anybody. We have stayed at luxury resorts and budget inns, and the Caribe Hilton is by far the worst experience we have ever had out of all the places we have stayed at. Never again.

<Content>Had a great time My husband and I stayed at the Caribe Hilton August 23 鈥?August 28 and we had a wonderful experience from the time we stepped out of the cab until we left. We were immediately greeted by the bellman and the front desk staff was courteous and helpful. We were upgraded to a Lagoon Villa room. The room had a small balcony (no room for chairs) with a nice view of the lagoon and the ocean. It was brand new, clean, had a comfortable bed and very nice bathroom. On Saturday morning there was noise from the air traffic at the little airport nearby-but it wasn鈥檛 bad. It was a little bit of a walk to get to from the main hotel, but we didn鈥檛 mind. The pool and hot tub near the Lagoon Villas and was a great alternative for when we didn鈥檛 feel like walking to the main pool. This pool was quiet and we usually had it to ourselves. The Villas also had their own front desk which we used to check-out, call cabs, ask questions etc. Every hotel staff person we came in contact with was friendly and courteous-even passing in the halls people would say hello and good morning. We ate lunch at the pool grill, breakfast at Palmera鈥檚 and had drinks at the lobby bar  pool bar. The food prices were expensive-but it is expected-any hotel has expensive restaurants. The lobby bar didn鈥檛 seem to have enough help some nights to wait the tables, so we usually ended up ordering directly at the bar. The drinks were good and fairly priced.The main pool was very nice. It was crowded on Sunday, along with the lagoon. Most days we opted to sit in chairs that were on the ocean (on the sidewalk leading to the fish pier). The fish pier was great; it was neat to be able to see so many fish so close without snorkeling. We were not overcharged for anything. The resort fee of $20 was a little annoying-but since we had such a great experience and paid 1% sales tax the whole time we were in PR, I got over it. The hotel is in a great location, we walked to Old San Juan one day, took the bus most other days. We also walked over to Condado a number of times. Being New Yorker's - we felt the cabs were expensive so we only took them at night.I was nervous because I had read the negative reviews on this site before we left. We had no problems whatsoever. We would recommend staying here and would stay again in the future.

<Content>Not so good. I have to agree with most posters here that the rooms and service at Caribe Hilton are very lacking. I was here on business staying at the Caribe for a second time. It was no better than the first go around. The rooms are really bad. I don't know how else to say it. My boss made the reservations and she is a Diamond Member. We still didn't get into the Executive Tower - we are all full - they told us. It's August - give me a break.So, we marched off to our rooms and the front desk clerk comes running after me. Trouble with the room key - I will be right back. It's midnight. She comes back and I just asked her straight out - someone was in that room, right? Yup. Had to move you to another floor. The rooms are just old. Everything needs updating. The bathrooms are very old. Breakfast - check it out. The fruit on the breakfast bar had mold on it. We usually just stick to the executive lounge, but we were meeting people that morning and we all went downstairs. Just okay.Location is great for me, but I just cannot abide by these rooms. Come on Hilton - $239 plus that resort fee in low season and you can't get some money to update the rooms?I think I will go back to the Ritz where our corporate rate is and put up with their bad service. At least the rooms are better.

<Content>Not bad.... I recently spent 6 nights at the Caribe while attending a conference. Check in was at about 5pm and took a total of 3 minutes, however the bellstaff were not eager so I walked my own bags to my room. I was in the villas on the second floor, the room was of fair size with a full kitchen and great balcony. The room was fresh and recently renovated, while there were plates, sliverware and glasses no cooking utensils or pans /pots were to be found (or soap for the dishwasher)! All in all the room was great.The Caribe has a few chioces for dining and I tried most of them, Mortons Steakhouse ($$$$) was by far the best with a close second being the Palmeras ($$) they have different nightly buffets and the roasting night was great (makes me think I should have tried the Puerto Rican night as well). During the afternoons or all day on the weekend the main pool bar is a buzz of people but I was very impressed with the bar staff as even as they were outnumbered 100 to 1 the levels of service were superb and as a man I didn't have on a two piece bikini but after brief wait the bartender came over introduced himself and asked my name then made the best pina colada EVER for me twice! The hotel needs to have this guy train all their staff.The beach and pool area are great, to get a hammock during prime time you need to move fast but the best time I had was after dinner about 10:30PM and walking out the pier thingy past the hammocks and looking at the fish that are attracted to the bring lights...they were huge and I was wishing for my speargun but alas its a no fishing or swimming zone just feeding which the hotel does daily as an attraction.Overall I would happily return to the Caribe Hilton.

<Content>Surely you can find somewhere else to stay I stayed in an executive-level room in the newer tower and the room itself was not bad and had a nice view. The executive level lounge had a good seleciton of snacks and drinks throughout the day. The grounds itself are generally pretty and include a tropical garden with a pond with swans, a private beach, two pools, and several restaurants and shops. So much for the good parts.Unfortunately, there were negative aspects that significantly cut into enjoying a vacation here, and they all revolve around terrible service and overcharging. For these reasons, I would advise you to stay elsewhere.We requested a nonsmoking room with two beds and confirmed it twice. Instead, we received a room that smelled of stale smoke, was on a floor with no non-smoking signs, and had just a single (king-size) bed. I was hesitant to request a room change, because from my experience, there can be a punative component and the replacement room is quite often worse.The service is poor. The valets and bellmen don't come out to greet you when you drive up, and the valet service takes a very long time to retrieve your car. The concierge is curt and answers most questions with a pre-printed sheet of paper. The driving directions that they handed out actually had an error. The paper handed to me a checkin listed the incorrect location for the breakfast area and executive lounge.Internet service is $15/day, but even if you want to pay, it doesn't work. The number to call for help connects to a support person in Warsaw, Poland (really).The phone in our room stopped working one day.Our room key cards expired and had to be reprogrammed at least once and sometimes twice per day.The final insult is the over-charging. In addition to a 9% tax, be prepared to find a 10% resort fee and a $1/day donation to an orphanage on your bill. They told me the resort fee was required by Puerto Rico law (yeah, right) and they would remove the orphanage donation but their computer was not working and told me to call back when I returned home.

<Content>Great place to stay This is an excellent hotel. The open-air lobby is very nice. Our room (in the main building) was very large and had a beautiful view of the ocean and the pool. The renovation of the hotel has made the whole property very nice.The pool was nice and the hammocks were relaxing. The grounds are very nice.For those who are disillusioned with the price of extras, welcome to resort hotels! You have to know that going in.The Caribe Hilton is a nice jumping off point for Condado or Old San Juan. Public transportation is close and cheap for those who don't want to take a cab, or you can walk if you're up to it.If there are cons, it is that the room has practically no electrical outlets and that the check-in process was the longest I have ever seen.However, don't hesitate to stay here. It's worth the money.

<Content>perfect relaxation spot... despite the reviews I booked the Caribe Hilton on Hotwire[--] for 3 nights before a cruise and booked on Priceline[--] for 1 night after the cruise. After reading all the reviews on tripadvisor I was a bit scared to say the least. I realized that I needed a new tower room. Well, my new wife and I showed up there and were not given a tower room. I was not the least bit disappointed. We had a room on the 7th floor of the main building and had a great view! The room and the view were absoulutely magnificant! Everyone was friendly. It was a nice walk to Condado to eat and even Old San Juan was not a bad walk.I cant figure out why there are so many bad reviews of this hotel. The pool was great too. Like I said, we did not have a new tower room, and we were still completely satisified with a main building room.By the way, it seems that most people paid $275 per night and up. We still would have been satisfied if we had paid that, but we booked on hotwire for $89/night and on Priceline for $77/night!! Even if we had not gotten this great rate we would still go back and pay $275/night.

<Content>Not so great We recently took a group of 30 people to Puerto Rico and stayed at the Hilton Caribe for our last two nights on the island. The booking process went smoothly, but the morning of check in is when the bad customer service began. From the moment I called to confirm our check- in, to the moment we left, none of our group had good reports for their workers. Most were just unhelpful and some were just snide. I did have a run in with a pleasant clerk,one helpful valet guy, and the consierge that was more than willing to help me, but as for the rest of the time we felt as if they were doing us a favor by letting us stay there. I would hope that when you pay any amount of money for a service, you would be treated like you are paying for a service instead of feeling like an unwanted house guest that's in for the weekend. The grounds of the hotel were beautiful and very convenient. The only comment on the food is to be prepared to spend more than you bargained for because EVERYTHING is an extra cost. Even the complementary water that most hotels (even cheap ones) give to you in the room had a hidden cost of $7.00. I personally don't like to feel as though I'm being tricked into spending my money; if I'm prepared or I feel as though I'm getting something for my money then I have no problem handing it over. All in all I'd rather pay a lot more money for a hotel that pretends to like their guests then save a couple dollars.

<Content>Nice Hotel Just got back from a one week vacation in P.R. We stayed at the Caribe Hilton for 2 nights. Our experience upon arrival echoed some of the previous reviews regarding the check-in process. We were given a room in the executive tower, only to find a large hole in the ceiling, above the shower. After complaining (nicely) we were given an upgrade to the villas. Unfortunately we encountered many who were dissatisfied with their rooms. Our room was clean with a great view. The hotel was relatively close to the Condado area (15-20min walk) although there was a mini-mart across the street. We were told the walk to OSJ was only 15 minutes, in reality it was more like 50min-1 hour and we are all in great shape. The gym had decent equipment and the restaurant food was good. Overall we (2 adults-2 teens) felt it was a nice property and would stay again.

<Content>Find somewhere else I have stayed here at least three or four times each time thinking with some of the great reviews from many places that I would give them the benefit of the doubt. That maybe they were just busy.But after the last stay I must say it cannot just be that they are busy. The service is horrible to say the least.The wait even if you are a platinum memeber is horrendous the check in takes at least 25 minutes. The rooms are aweful .If you book with any sort of discount i.e. AAA or anything else be prepared for a view of the top of an A/C unit. Everytime I have stayed here business or pleasure the room is aweful. We went for business and my boss actually got stuck in a room with a murphy bed ( folds into the wall) and they charged 290.00 a night for this again with a viiew of roof of builiding with A/C unitThe only thing nice I can say about this hotel is it has a nice pool and the Steakhouse is very good. But unless you plan on sleeping at the pool which might not be a bad idea,because the view is excellent, I would not stay here.I am going back for business in August and will not stay here again.I think four strikes and you are definitley out!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Beautiful resort, excellent service, bad rooms!! This is a belated posting from our post-cruise stay at the Caribe Hilton from Jan 1st - Jan 3rd this year! I must say I did not wanna get off the ship but once we arrived at the resort - I had no regrets. It was just beautiful and as you walk to the ocean after check-in, you get a sense of the vast lobby. Since we arrived around 11, we were told our room won't be ready till 2:30. So, we decided to have lunch by the pool and just relax and take it all in! The beach is small but clean. We got a room on the 9th floor in the tower next to the main resort. The view wasn't WOW but it was still very nice. It had a rain shower and a very well done bathroom. My ONLY complaint was the mold and a strong smell throughout the room. We opened up the doors as soon as we walked in hoping it will go away in a few hours. But it didn't and I got a weird rash/itch each time I got into the bed. Next morning, I complained to the housekeeping and within minutes the manager was over and promised to take care of it. She changed the bedding, quilt, and all the sheets and even left me a note explaining all that was done to take care of the problem while we were out. We came back around 7:30pm and she immediately called to check if we still had the same problem. That was very nice of her and I thanked her for her service. It felt fine until an hour to two when I got the same itch as I got ready for bed. My husband opened one of the cabinets - and there it was - A Nasty cabinet FULL of mold. It was too disgusting to even look at it. I am not sure if it was just our room or what, but I couldn't stop itching the two night we spent here. This was our first resort experience in the Caribbean and I would go back any day. The bus stop is very close by and will take you to Old San Juan for a couple of dollars in 15-20 minutes - so worth it! The only place to eat nearby is a Subway so definitely pack up water bottles and snacks when out shopping in any grocery store. Overall, it was a great place to be and worth every penny and more for $95.00 on priceline!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Beautiful, Relaxing and Enjoyable!! Wow! We booked this hotel as part of our travel package through our travel agent. When reading some of the reviews here (before traveling) I was VERY worried! However, the Caribe Hilton rooms, staff, facilities and offerings were all very accommodating for us! We arrived in SJ early (10 a.m.). We were allowed to register at the front desk, change our clothes in changing rooms, explore the hotel grounds, and have a very delicious lunch. When we checked back our room was ready. I must admit I was disappointed that our OceanVIEW room was not oceanFRONT!! It's hard to describe but from our balcony we could see the ocean but just below our balcony was the ROOF of a smaller hotel building so we had to try to block out that cement eyesore and look way over it to see the beach. I returned to the front desk to ask for a room with a better view and was told NONE of the rooms is truly oceanFRONT and that they were full and therefore unable to move us to another room. I was not happy about that but must admit the rest of the stay (ignoring the obstructed view) was great! For the reviewer who said they didn't change the towels... there was some notice that stated in an effort to conserve energy the hotel gives the guests the option to have their towels changed daily or not. If you wanted them changed you were to take the used towels off the racks. If I had not read that bit of info I too would have been upset to return to the room  to the same old towels! But a quick call to housekeeping would have resolved that. We enjoyed the pool, the beach, the restaurants, the fitness room, AND had delicious pizza from ROOM Service (can u believe that?) We also took advantage of the tours available in the lobby ~ opting for a day at the rainforest. Our travel agent put together a pretty comprehensive package so we weren't hit with any surpise fees or taxes... Oh! and by the way, we took taxis from the hotel to Old San Juan a couple of times including the day we were leaving. So, once again, after checking out the bellhops held our luggage while we ran into Old SJ for a museum tour and some final shopping. All-in-all, the Caribe Hilton was beautiful and fun and the staff was wonderful!!

<Content>Over rated The hotel has the best frozen drinks but then goes down hill from there.The carpets in the hallways are stained with large bleach spots.The walls in the rooms have flaking paint and water stains. The sheets are stained.The pool is open for local kids to come and go as they please, which gives little room for the hotel guest to use the pool. On the weekend the sounds of kids playing in the pools makes it impossible for the guest to get any relaxation. The staff at the front desk did not seem to know how to operate the terminals and we spent 30 min waiting in line to check in. They charged us for the Breakfast which was included in the room rate and it took 3 trips to the front desk to get them to fix the errors. 2 stars at the most

<Content>Avoid This Hotel!! Originally I had planned to stay at the Ritz, but a friend of mine that lives in San Juan recommended the Hilton鈥IG MISTAKE. I was going there with my wife for our 5 year wedding anniversary. My friend recommended that we stay in the Villas, but request a room on the ocean side as a new building was being built on the other side and the construction started at 4:30 a.m. I called and made the reservation 2 weeks in advance of our stay and requested the Ocean side. The day before our arrival, I sent an email to confirm. I received an email back that yes, we would receive a room, high up and on the ocean side. Also stated that we could have an early check in. We arrived at around 1:00 p.m. I was told that our high-up, ocean view room wasn鈥檛 available, but that it would be ready within 1 hour. We had taken the red eye flight from Phoenix on Jet Blue and had been up for a total of 18 hours straight.Knowing that we were going to get a great room, I didn鈥檛 have a problem waiting the 1 hour, so we had lunch at the hotel. At 2:30 pm I was told another 30 minutes, so we simply hung out in the lobby. At 3, told another 30 minutes. This went on for about another hour. At 4 pm we decided to take a taxi around the island. At 6 pm we came back and were given our room keys 鈥?the room was on the 1st floor, with a view of a wall, over on the construction side. I went to complain and was told that they would move us to another room. I had also asked for a room with a kitchen 鈥?was told that the new room had one. The new room we were given was also on the construction side and had no kitchen. I was told that the following day that they would move us to a better location. The room we were given was dirty and the curtains didn鈥檛 close all the way, so in the morning, it was very hard to sleep with the loud construction noise and the sunlight coming into the room. The next day, I was told that they didn鈥檛 have another room and that we would be stuck in this room. The room that they claimed had a kitchen, only had a mini refrigerator and a coffee maker 鈥?I don鈥檛 call this a kitchen. Our room keys stopped working 3 separate times and each time, the rude staff made us feel that it was our fault or that we were too stupid to know how to unlock the door. Funny thing is that from checking reviews online, others had the same experience. The pool was extremely dirty and hotel staff was pretty much all rude. Having a problem with paying around $300 per night for such a dump, we tried to check out. However we were told that since we didn鈥檛 give 24 hours notice, we would have to pay another $200. I decided to just stick it out a few more nights 鈥?things went downhill even more from here 鈥?no clean towels, more rude service, AC stopped working 鈥?finally on the last night of our stay in San Juan, we checked out and went to the Embassy Suites 鈥?what a difference and the rooms here were only $175 per night 鈥?people were extremely friendly. One last comment about the Hilton 鈥?be careful of all the extra charges. When I booked over the phone, I was told that the room rate was $285 per night and 9% tax. However when checking out, I see that they also added a 10% resort fee. When I asked what this was for, I was told that it was for the upkeep of the pool, as well as for housekeeping and the bellboy service. This was always part of the hotel fee in the past. This hotel also charges $15 per day for internet access and around $8 for the 1st minute to call the States. They also force you to make a donation to 鈥渉omeless children鈥?for each day that you stay 鈥?automatically appears on your bill at the time of check out. AVOID THIS PLACE!

<Content>Nightmare Resort Good things about the hotel:1. They have the best pina coladas I have ever tasted.2. Hotel is located on a private beach3. Lemon Grass restaurant is top notch. Bad things about the hotel:1. RUDE staff2. 陆 the rooms haven鈥檛 been updated. This is why you have some people liking the place and other not liking it. Problem is that you can request a remodeled room, but you will never know until you arrive what you will have. 3. They are building a high-rise building next to the hotel, and construction goes from Mon-Sat and starts at 5 am. Very hard to sleep. 4. Room keys stopped working 5 times. We stayed in the Villas so had to walk to the other side of the hotel to get new keys. This isn鈥檛 much fun when you are coming back at 2-3 am. Finally on last day of our trip, the lock was replaced on our room. Staff never apologized for this. 5. They 鈥渘ickel and dime鈥?you at this hotel -- $14.95 for internet access per day when other hotels include this for free. $35 dollars for a 18 minute call to the US. 10% 鈥渞esort fee鈥?for daily newspaper 鈥?which we never received, access to the beach and pool and for upkeep of the hotel. 6. Pool is EXTREMELY dirty and in need of repairs. 7. They let anyone into the pool 鈥?on a few times we did visit it, there were a number of locals using it. 8. Walls are paper thin. The room net to us had two adults and 7 children. Could hear them yelling and playing all day and night. When I complained, I was told that the couple runs a 鈥渂abysitting service鈥?from the room and that she has rented it for 3 months so far and is a good 鈥渃ustomer鈥? I could go on, but I think you get the point 鈥?DON鈥橳 STAY AT THIS HOTEL.

<Content>Our favorite hotel My wife and I have traveled extensively to Europe, Africa, Asia, the South Pacific, Mexico and the Caribbean. I can state unequivocably that the Caribe Hilton in San Juan is far and away our favorite. Unlike the other San Juan hotels it has a lovely private beach. The general manager makes enormous effort to upgrade the hotel and its amenities. But the secret of the Caribe Hilton's success is its highly intelligent and motivated staff. This is true of each and every chambermaid right up to the staff and supervision at the front desk, the corporate and executive lounges. I make this statement based upon many visits to this hotel (4X a year) and innumerable interactions with the staff.Frequent travelers are aware that misunderstandings and mistakes can happen in the best of hotels.I cannot account for another reviewer's alleged negative experience with Enitza, in the executive lounge, but our experience with her has been invariably positive. She is a very sweet and helpful girl who did not deserve the comment made by that other reviewer.

<Content>Loved the Caribe Hilton My wife and I stayed at the Caribe Hilton in May-June 2005 for 7 nights, and it was amazing. It was our belated honeymoon, so we wanted everything to be perfect. I had luckilly signed up for a promotion a month before i went where I became a Hilton Gold member. We payed in advance on expedia for $100 a night (I dont understand why it is now $170 a night, but thats just me). The first thing I did when we got there was tell them it was our honeymoon and that I was a goldmember, and they upgraded us to an amazing oceanview room with a balcony. The view of the ocean was amazing. The room was well kept, with everything being refilled nightly. They also gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries (though I did have to remind them twice before they brought it up, but hey free is free). We frequented the Starbucks a lot, didnt eat a any of the other restaurants, but they looked nice. The bar was ok, although I ordered the same drink each night and it somehow came out differently each time, sometimes good and sometimes bad. The pools were amazing, overlooking the ocean. They had a gameroom which was small but nice to have. The location was ok - we actually walked to Old San Juan, took about 25 minutes each way, on the way back we tried to get a cab but none passed, and it was quite hot. It was also a 15 minute walk to the Wyndham hotel with a casino, and the birdge which we needed to walk over was rickity. However, lal in all the hotel was really nice and it is the sole reason we are going to another Hilton for our vacation this year in Curacao - also, we got that resort for $70 a night plus tax so cant beat the price.

<Content>Very pleased with our stay at Caribe Hilton My parents, sister and I stayed at the Caribe Hilton for a week in May and were very pleased overall. Noteworthy positives (in no particular order) based on our experience :(1) Great location - very close to Escambron (one of the 4 Blue flag beaches in PR)(2) Close to Old San Juan (easily accessible by cabs/buses)(3) Small but clean private beach (which is a huge bonus if you're feeling too lazy to venture out to one of the public beaches) with several hammocks and plenty of beach chairs(4) Helpful and courteous hotel staff (5) Knowledgeable conceirge (gave us great direction to the sights in and around San Juan)(6) The hotel offers day trips/tours that originate at the hotel which are a great option for folks that dont drive.Some disadvantages:(1) The hotel does offer seven or more dining options, but we found it to be over priced (2) But if you dont want to eat at the hotel, you dont have too many options near the hotel (other than a Subway 5 mins away from the hotel enterance); but Old San Juan offers seveal options (for different budgets) and I would recommend eating before you get back to your Hotel given the lack of choices around the hotel.

<Content>LOVED the Caribe Hilton and the Executive Lounge 4 1/2 stars I just returned from 3 nights at the Caribe HIlton where I traveled alone for business. I LOVED THIS HOTEL! When I checked in I told them I was a woman alone and asked for a room in a busy area of the hotel. They upgraded me to the executive level in the main building. I was able to go from my conference to my room quickly and always felt safe, and the executive lounge is fantastic! They have a free continental breakfast with more than just donuts (toast, muffins, cereal, fruit, yogurt). They have free drinks and hordeovers from 5:30-8 pm and mini desserts and cordials at night. Troughout the day there is free soda, water, coffee, fruit and little ham sandwiches which I ate for lunch rather than spend $20 for lunch at one of the restaurants. It allowed me to splurge on some really great dinners---twice at Madrid, the spanish restraunt, and once at Morton's, the upscale and pricey steakhouse. The Executive Lounge also had a computer with free high speed internet for checking email, printing boarding passes, etc. as well as 2 wide screen TV's and daily newspapers including the NY Times. Does it get much better than that?I heard the tower building rooms were better than the main building, but I was thrilled to be in the main building. The location is closer to the beach and pool, and my room was one of the largest and most comfortable I have been in. Although it did not have a balcony, it did have a HUGE picture window with an oceanfront view. From what I could tell the balconies on other rooms were very small so this was fine for me. I moved the comfy arm chair and ottoman right next to that window and felt like I was sitting above the sea. The a/c worked well and my room was always cleaned early, with turn down service too! The linens were upscale and the room was very attractive with a LARGE closet, marble bathrom, etc. When I checked in there was a flickering, buzzing lightbulb in the bathroom. One phone call and it was fixed. The bathroom had Crabtree and Eveyln toiletries. Nice!The pool area at this hotel is lovely, though it seemed a bit crowded when the hotel filled up on the weekend. I never had trouble finding a lounge chair, quiet area or shady spot. The beach is small. The water is calm, clear and clean with no rocks or yucky seeweed areas, but it is not the crystal blue water I love in the Caribbean. Again, plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas. The garden area is gorgeous and a great place to relax in the shade, read a book, etc with lovely flowers and even a couple of swans along the lagoon.I visited the SPA for a refelxology massage and must say this was a big disasppointment. The SPA itself is lovely, but they must have assigned me a beginner. Either she knew nothing about reflexology or she was really bad at it. I should have complained on the spot but I didn't.My final criticism is that the banana daiqeries at the pool bar were really lousy. I was surprised they didnt use real bananas but instead just a mix. Blech. For such a nice hotel they should really improve this.This hotel caters to families and business travelers. I would not go there for my honeymoon, but next time I go for business I will bring my family (if it was just vacation I might pick a place with a more expansive, white sand blue water beach). It would have been nice if there were some more moderately priced dining options, but I guess thats good motivation to leave the hotel. BTW, there is a Starbucks in the lobby which was great for a less expensive dessert.I have travelled extensively in the Caribbean but this was my first trip to PR. This is a top notch hotel. The restaurants were SUPERB! I gave it 5 stars though really it deserves 4 1/2. Trip Advisor should have a category for VERY good instead of just above average.

<Content>Nice property, dated room, poor customer service I stayed at the Caribe for four nights in March. The property is nice, with its own beach area, but be prepared to rely on taxis or rental car if you're interested in doing much outside of the resort property.The beach area is small but nice. They have a nice lagoon-like area for tranquil swimming. Snorkling equipment is available--for a charge, but it's worth it. Saw plenty of beautiful ocean life. I had a nice breakfast in the dining room. Very well-presented buffet with a variety of options for all tastes. I was very disappointed in the room for the price we paid ($199 per night). After being there for two nights, I chatted with a friend who was also staying there and discovered that there are very different room types in different areas of the resort. She too was paying $199 but had a VERY different room. Mine was dark and outdated with worn furnishings and a bathroom in need of renovation. Hers was bright, airy and newly renovated. Our bed was short-sheeted. One hour into sleep on the first night, I awoke to find that the bottom sheet had creeped up under my knees. I called the front desk to complain and they assured me that the matter would be resolved the next day. This happened EVERY day, despite my repeated calls. Does the hotel not have adequate-sized sheets?????I interacted with staff members at the reception desk three times and with the concierge once. All of the staff were incredibly rude.The final annoyance occurred during check-out. I reviewed my bill and saw that I had been charged a mandatory fee that went to housekeeping and bellhop staff. Upon check-in, not a single bellhop had offered to assist with luggage (even though plenty of guys were standing around). And after the battle over the sheets, I was determined not to pay a penny for housekeeping service. I was able to get the charge removed, but did not receive so much as an apology for the negligent service.

<Content>Beware of fraudulent charges I'm a HHonors Gold, which entitles members to late check out, when available, according to HHonors policy. I stayed in early Jan. 06, asked for late check-out, was told by Enitza in the Exec. Lounge (who was rude) that it wasn't available, and then told it was available for $75. I was ripping and declined to pay them $75 to stay until 2:00 p.m. Enitza called me in my room, said they had a parlor room available for 2 hours, never mentioned the $75 again, so I accepted. When I got my card statement, the total bill for the stay was higher than I expected. I had to contact the hotel several times and in Feb. I got a copy of my statement, which included the $75 charge PLUS other charges that I had not made. I had saved my reservation with the rate, which also quoted a $20 resort fee. The bill charged $25---$5 bucks, big deal. Had they not tried to rip me off, I would have let it slide. BUT, since it was next to impossible to contact anyone there and since the staff here is totally unresponsive, I had to dispute the charge with VISA. Bottom line, the charges were reversed and 2 weeks ago it was removed from my card. Not a bad property, but the customer service was obnoxious. If you like staying in a place where the staff is condescending and acts like they are doing you a serious favor by letting you stay, this is the place. Otherwise, Marriott is just down the street, in a better location, and with a better beach....and without the obnoxious attitude.

<Content>Great Week at the Caribe Hilton! My boyfriend and I just returned from a wonderful week at the Caribe Hilton. We had a beautiful king deluxe room in the Hilton Honors Tower. Our room had a balcony providing amazing sea views. The bathroom was incredible - all granite, his  hers sinks, huge walk-in glass shower with sitting area and 2 shower heads.We stuffed ourselves at the breakfast buffet in Palmera's Restaurant every morning. The selection was great - fresh fruits, eggs, meats, cheeses, cereals, breads/pastries, juices and champagne, too! We had dinner at Morton's and Lemongrass. Morton's was good, what you would expect from any Morton's. Lemongrass was very quiet and intimate, but the menu was a little overdone. Still, it was a great option when we did not want to leave the hotel one night and is in a lovely setting in the hotel's garden. We enjoyed room service a couple of times for sandwiches and the food was also excellent. However, the hotel could speed up it's tray removal from the hall!The hotel's facilities are great. The private beach is clean with plenty of beach chairs and umbrellas available. The pools are clean and the swim up bar is a lot of fun! Oh, and don't forget to say hello to the parrots in the lobby, Pancho and Koko...they may say hello back to you!The hotel spa, Olas, is great. We had a couple's massage on our first day and it was a great start to a week of relaxation. We really liked the hotel's location - away from the busy Isla Verde strip. It was a $20.00 cab ride from the airport, and only a $10.00 cab ride to Old San Juan. We wanted a week of complete relaxation and we got that and more at the Caribe Hilton!

<Content>Great Place to Stay Positive: My wife and I just got back from a week there. We stayed 15-23 May, and the weather was great. They have a good pool with a swim-up bar as well as a private little beach. The room was clean and housekeeping service was like clockwork every day. The room air conditioning was great (freezing if you wanted it to be) and that was OK with me, because it was pretty hot outside. There's also a good bar/lounge located next to the lobby with some live entertainmment most nights. The rooms have a small refigerator and mini-bar, hair blowers, and iren/ironing board, although our room's iron was missing. Not a big deal, I called down for one and they brought it up right away. A plus with me was the hotel internet access in the rooms. Several clothing and other stores are located in the lobby/ground floor area. The main advantage to the Hilton is its central location near Old San Juan with its historical sites and museums, the Condado area on Ashford Avenue just across the Dos Hermanos Bridge, and the easy accessibility to Highway 26. Be prepared to take plenty of photos, bring plenty of SPF35 sun protector, and buy yourself a hat for protection from the sun. Anytime you're away from the beach or the pool, it's going to be very hot. We got a bargain through Hotels(-) at $161/day room rate. Lots of great food and drink, especially if you know where to go! I would definitely stay again. Don't gamble on anything less than a 4 or 5-star hotel. Anything less gets seedy and you get what you pay for. My second choice in that area would be the Condado Plaza Hotel and Casino just across the Dos Hermanos Bridge from the Hilton, or the Ritz Carlton.Negative: The only thing that really bugs me in Puerto Rico is that the hotels charge extra or separately for parking. You are a paying guest at the Caribe Hilton and yet they charge you $15 a day extra to park. The good thing about the Hilton is that they add it onto your room bill when you check out. At some others you pay as you go on a daily basis. It's just a pet peeve of mine that I think if you're a paying guest you shouldn't be charged for parking, but virtually all the hotels in San Juan do it. Somebody should complain to the tourism bureau or something.Tip: Parking is HORRIBLE in Old San Juan, so be prepared to park somewhere along Ponce de Leon Avenue (around La Casa de Espa帽a or the Taxation Building Hacienda), then walk straight into La Fortaleza Street in Old San Juan. Ponce de Leon Avenue turns into La Fortaleza Street from Plaza Colon (the square with a fountain and a tall statue of Christopher Columbus) onward.

<Content>Just Okay This hotel is just okay. We requested a new tower room but did not get it. We ended up staying in a renovated room in the older building. It was okay. The bathroom was small and the work done in the room wasn't great. I found very adult magazines in the room presumibly from the previous guest. That makes me question how good they are actually cleaned. The hotel manager sent us a bottle of wine and candy....however we don't drink so it went to waste. Housekeeing came to get the magazines but they did not apoligize. On a better note the breakfast buffet and Monday Puerto Rican dinner buffet were excellent. They had something for everyone and were really nice.The grounds are also very nice. I have stayed at many hotels on business and vacations. This hotel isn't one of the better ones. It's just okay.

<Content>Had a wonderful time .... My husband and I just returned from 5 nights at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan. Let's say I was more than a little nervous about this hotel because of the negative reviews. Our flight out of JFK arrived early and our room wasn't ready when we arrived. I have to say that I was a little disappointed in the changing rooms. They were small and not well appointed so I was a little wary... but when our room was ready we got an upgrade to an ocean view room on the 8th floor. The room was spacious and the view was very nice. The room was clean, although it could have used a face lift - new carpeting and bead spreads would have made a world of difference. We spent most of our time either at the pool or on the beach, both of which were just wonderful. There was never an issue getting chairs or towels and the weather was fabulous. Due to the dining options, (Mortons, Lemongrass, an Italian and Spanish restaurant there was really no reason to leave for us). The bar was lively and the entertainment was pretty good. Puerto Rico is perfect from us because of the direct flight options out of NYC and the weather always cooperates. It's also a big plus that they have a Starbucks right in the hotel which is a great quick breakfast option and the pool bar and restuarant and beach chair service made for a very relaxing trip. We will go back.

<Content>The Caribe was a nice week Yes, it was built in the 50's, but there's a real funky charm to the place, and much of it has been totally redone. The staff -every single peron-was helpful, polite and seemed to be having fun! The hotel is short cab ride from Old San Juan, and in our view, that was a good thing. The beach was excellent, as were the pools. We had a room in the tower with a great view and beautiful breeze. We were at a convention and the hotel handled it seamlessly. You can venture out for food--there are lots of places to eat just a short cab ride away. Very relaxing.

<Content>Not as terrible as the reviews Our room was spacious and clean. I did notice some old wall areas that were not patched up properly, but nothing that hindered our stay. Concierge was very helpful and we didn't have much to complain about. I will say that we paid $90 per night on priceline and had we paid $200+ like some of the other guests, I might have been more particular about things. We didn't spend too much time at the hotel because we had lots of tours, but we were VERY grateful that we stumbled upon Lemongrass (one of the restaurants in the hotel) on our last night. I have eaten at nearly all the highest rated restaurants in NYC, plus many others spanning over 20 countries, and Lemongrass was probably up there as one of my favorite overall dining experiences. I've had higher quality food elsewhere, but when you combine the service, innovative menu, well-executed food, and chic but not overly pretentious ambience with decent prices (not cheap, but decent), it exceeded expectations. Even if you decide not to stay at the Hilton, you must try Lemongrass.

<Content>A little disappointing I just returned from the Caribe hilton, stayed from 5/12 - 5/15. I took my mother for the weekend as a mothers day gift. I have been a few places and I don't consider myself fussy but I have to say, I was disappointed in the whole Puerto rico experience considering how expensive everthing is over there. At first I requested a room in the main building based on a review I read here that these were the better rooms. That was not true these rooms were in desperate need of repair maybe even just a fresh coat of paint would have made it better. The bathroom I could barely turn around in and I'm only 140lbs and there was mildew in between the tiles. The second day I requested to be tranfered to a room in the executive tower because another guest told me that thes rooms were renovated. These rooms had larger bathrooms with marble walls and double sinks, but the wall in the room were again dirty. I mean writing on the walls dirty and paint peeling off. The room also smelled musty, I guess from the humidity but they should figure out how to get rid of that smell they are a large hotel. The grounds were nice. The pool was very crowded with a lot of kids running around. The restaurants, we only had breakfast in one it was ok. We mostly ate in Old San Juan. We had access to the executive lounge wher they offerd free continental breakfast which we also had one morning and that was ok also. Overall it was an ok trip, I had read the reviews by some people here and thought maybe they were just picky, but I guess not.

<Content>Good Hotel for the price, great beach I stayed at the Caribe Hilton from 5/11 to 5/15. The hotel is average. The room was very clean, but in need of some minor repairs (comestic). The staff was pretty friendly and efficient. I ate once at the pool restaurant and the food was awful. The private beach was absolutely gorgeous. The water was calmed, cleared, and cleaned. Good hotel for the money!

<Content>Liked the hotel; loved Lemongrass restaurant Like everyone else, I was nervous to select this hotel in light of some of the bad reviews shown by prior travelers. However, I reasoned that you couldn't beat the price for a Hilton (we paid $170/night for a standard room on the pre-paid plan, 5/11-5/14) and the location seemed to be ideal (halfway between Condado and Old San Juan - we determined true walkability when we got there).We arrived around 1:30, and I checked ahead of time to see how booked the hotel would be during our stay and it appeared to be not more than 50% occupied. Nonetheless, we were told we would have to wait two hours to check in, which was fine as we were more interetested in drinks than naps at that point anyway. Had a bite and a few drinks at the Atlantico pool bar. Service was friendly but slow, hamburgers were pretty poor and not necessarily beef (as evidenced by our upset stomachs later on), but drinks were tasty and welcomed. Prices very high for the quality on food, acceptable for drinks ($11 cheeseburger, $8 pina colada, $7.50 Corona). Finally checked in around 4pm to Garden Wing room 753. Room was spacious (even bathroom, contrary to other reviews) and the view was amazing (fort, ocean, other two wings). Evidence of a few leaks in the ceiling that were roughly patched up, but not terribly offensive.Dinner first night in Madrid-San Juan restaurant on the property. Great selection of wines, tapas, and true spanish entrees. Sat at the bar; Luis, the bartender, was very helpful in advising us which menu items to steer clear of (tortilla espanola is not fresh! not fresh at all!) and in picking out where to go and when from a tourist perspective. Slow service there as well but we were in no rush so it was fine. Food was very good and very reminiscent of northern and southern Spanish cuisines; prices were very reasonable (dinner was actually cheaper than lunch). Glass of house wine (very tasty) is $10.The next few days were delightfully lazy. There are several areas in which to sit around the water (big pool complex off of main building, smaller pool/jacuzzi area off of Garden Wing, small beach closer to the spa). Lunch from the health bar was tasty but expensive ($27 for two wraps and two cans of soda). No complaints about the pool (aside from your usual noisy families making their way through); comfy chairs and towels, ideal water temperature and generally spacious deck areas.Tried the walk to Old San Juan; probably should have brought a map as it was longer than we expected, and it takes you through some shady areas if you don't know the way very well. Cabs will take you there for $15 but you can (and SHOULD) negotiate with them, as they'll do it for as low as $7-$10 (it's a 7-minute ride). The tourism department has schedules of ridiculous fares for various rides (including airport to Hilton) but they're way out of line and, apparently, always negotiable. Old San Juan is quaint, pretty, and almost exactly what its name implies: an old spanish town, now teeming with jewelry and tourist shops in the daytime. At night, it's your typically metropolitan hot-spot, with its fair share of urban chic bars, nightclubs, and lounges. All reasonably priced, great atmosphere, and a lovely mix of locals and tourists.Condado is a shorter walk with a less thrilling atmosphere. More of a strip, with pockets of visitor-friendliness scattered about. Ajili Mojili was the recommended restaurant, and rightly so with its well-prepared truly Puerto Rican cuisine. We were underdressed, even for mid-day lunch, in shorts and t-shirts but service was nonetheless friendly and attentive.The most important aspect of my review is our final night's dinner at Lemongrass in the hotel. This is one of the greatest dining experiences I have ever had, home or abroad. Atmosphere, service, food, and overall ambience was absolutely amazing, and I'd never go back to Puerto Rico without going back to this restaurant. It was priced appropriately for the quality, and it was the perfect ending to our vacation. Can't stop raving, and won't attempt to disparage any aspect of it by detailing any other aspect...I'll just say it was really, really great. And I'm usually very picky about great restaurants.I've been going to Bermuda every year since I was 2 (I'm 23), and this was a new experience for me. It's not the classiest island, but it's not trying to be. It's more like a very spanish version of Miami, as my boyfriend aptly described it. It's clearly thick with tourism, construction, political dissention, and entertainment. I prefer Bermuda, but am glad to have seen Puerto Rico and will probably go back at least once in my lifetime. Next time, however, I might stay in another part of the country and do more of a nature sightseeing vacation as opposed to our RR vacation this time around.

<Content>Tower Room was fine at the Caribe. My boyfriend and I stayed at the Caribe from May 5-12,stayed in a tower room on the 13th floor/oceanfront and it was fine.If your staying at the caribe in the towers there is no need to worry.I was leary coming here because of the bad reviews but there was nothing wrong with the room,no extra charges but I booked through a travel agent so there was no additional charges. If anything needs a bad review its San Juan/Old San Juan it looked like the ghetto.It was dirty and the bars in Old San Juan looked like some speakeasy not a bar.The best places were Bacardi(very clean)and Senor Frogs but when there is a cruise ship in because if not there is no one in the place.And as far as renting a car we did at Hertz at the Caribe get the insurance the people of PR drive crazy and we parked and didn't pay right in front of the little store on the side of the hotel also they sell 6 packs of beer for $9.75 instead of paying the $6.00 for one beer at the hotel.The cab fair is a bit ridiculous everything is $10.00 for a 5 minute ride.

<Content>Loved the San Juan Hilton Caribe!! We found this Hotel and the staff to be just excellent. We will definately go back. The grounds were beautiful and well kept. We enjoyed watching peacocks, swans, geese, and walking through the grounds where there were ponds, gazebo's, waterfalls, a fish feeding dock, hammocks, swimming pools, whirlpools, etc. Just beautiful. We had a great time and enjoyed the view of the Ocean and Gardens from our Garden Wing balcony Room. Loved it!!

<Content>Very nice hotel, but nothing comes cheap Like a previous reviewer, I was also at this hotel for a large conference. Overall, I found the facilities, rooms, and staff to be excellent. The exercise room was nice, the pools were well-attended, and the views and access to the beach cannot be topped. The adjacent Spanish fort was a nice touch, too. The short pier was also a great place for some fish-watching. The room (in the Villas) was nice as well, particularly the large bathroom and the water view from the short private balcony. If you want a resort experience, you can find it here. My only complaint is the overall price. I got a good room rate for the conference, but I was amazed at what the steep room cost does not offer in the amenities department. Internet was available in the room but for $14.95/day, which seemed ludicrous to me for what I paid for the room already. (You can, however, find some free Wi-Fi at the Starbucks Coffee in the hotel lobby, so watch for that.) Parking is ample, but they charge $15.00/day for that, too. And don't be surprised if you have to pay more than $10 for a bagel with a nice spread on it! The hotel has several eating establishments in it, but they can be quite expensive. You'll not find much else to eat nearby, but the hotel is only about a 5-7 minutes drive or taxi ride to Old San Juan with many great restaurants.

<Content>Beware - Total Rip-Off and the Worst Hilton Stayed at the Caribe Hilton for business for the SAA convention for a week, at the Government rate. The property is confusing - upon checking in they didn't tell me there was a difference between the main building and tower rooms, so exhausted after flying in, went up and down the wrong elevators dragging my suitcases trying to find my room...My oceanview room in the tower had a view of an ugly building roof, with a small glimpse of the ocean in horizon. When I went to open up the sliding glass door, the handle fell off the door. When I went to call for service, the phones didn't work. After complaining, they moved me to the main building, which had a view of the ocean and fort, and was acceptable, though the bathroom is small.Room service was prompt, fairly priced and acceptable (a veggie burger for $10). Here are where the problems begin...my keys deactivated 4 times - twice in one day, once when I was hand-carryying the key to the pool. I had to wait on a long line to renew my keys four times - and the manager insinuated that I didn't understand how to use my key correctly! They finally switched the lock out, but maintaned that it was my fault for deactivating keys. They comped me a free lunch which was nice - the seafood buffet was excellent - very, very good hotel food.Upon checking out I learned about all the hidden fees. I was chared an extra $19.50 resort fee for each day. When I asked about it and told them I hadn't agrees to it, they said it was impossible to take it off. I've since been dealing with Hilton corporate, who still maintain they can't take the charges off. They claim the charges cover the coffee in the room, access to the beach and pool, a local newspaper, and access to the fitness center. Last time I chacked, these were standard ameneties at all hotels! This hotel will nickel and dime you to death. There are additional charges for practially everything. I'm suprised they didn't charge us for ice. The service was mixed - sometimes we had the most freindly, professional service, and other times, we were made to feel like an imposition to the hotel. There is not much around the hotel - so it is a $10 cab ride each way into Old San Juan. I'd stay there - I've stayed at Hotel Milano and Westin - at least you can get out and walk there. And plus, they don't charge you extra for a packet of coffee in your room, a .25 local paper, and access to their gym. Caribe Hilton - what a rip off!

<Content>Great location, but check the bill before check-out! I recently stayed at the Caribe Hilton for a large conference, and all in all I was pleased with the room, the facilities, and the staff. My only complaint was a mistake on the billing when I tried to separate the room charges from the food and drink billed to the room during my stay. They put both charges on the wrong card, resulting in my checking account being overdrawn. I'm still waiting to get it corrected over the phone, as their computer has been down for a bit. That detail aside, the time I spent there was as good as I hoped for and better than I expected given the mix of reviews. I stayed in the main tower, the closest to the lobby. I saw the rooms of colleagues in the other two towers, and I understood some of the reviews. They look adequate but a little older and worn. For the money spent, try to get a room in the main tower. The food and drink are good but a bit pricey, except for the breakfast buffet which is actually a pretty good bargain and a great spread. Both the Condado and Old San Juan are a healthy, but not too strenuous, walk from the hotel and worth the effort. I heard rumor of the walk to Old San Juan from the Hilton being unsafe, but I found myself much more frightened during a ride in an unofficial taxi back to the hotel from Old SJ.

<Content>Beautiful Grounds, Great Pool, Would stay here again !! I stayed at the Caribe Hilton for 4 nights (April 22-April 26). I was very concerned because of the several negative comments I had read. Me and my fiance' will not settle for average standards in a hotel or resort whether traveling in the states or abroad. Our experience at the Caribe Hilton was Great and we will certainly stay here again.The check-in process was rather quick and we were able to take advantage of the Executive Lounge on the 9th floor which provided free breakfast, cocktails and snacks and nightly desert. This was a definate benefit and the quality of food and drinks were superb. The view from the 9th floor lounge was amazing.Our room was a standard room on the 8th floor. Beautiful view and comfortable beds. The bathroom was a little small, however, we didnt spend much time in there! The lobby in the hotel was open to the ocean and displayed a beautiful view of the pool and ocean. The property grounds were beautiful and comparable to a Sandals resort. I loved the 3 tiered pool with small waterfalls. Plenty of spaces for families and couples alike to find a perfect spot. The ocean cove area was very nice and clean. I prefer the pool so only spent time walking there however people were snorkeling only 30' or so from the beach. I can't say enough about the property....I walked the entire grounds daily and enjoyed it all.There were several places to eat, some were pricey, but hey, you are on vacation ! The Olas Health Bar Cafe was my favorite place to eat for lunch...wonderful wraps and salads. Just a short walk over to the spa and workout area and this is a super place to grab lunch and take back to the pool area to eat. After I discovered the Olas Health Bar, I ate there every day even when my fiance' choose a burger from the Atlantico Pool Bar  Grill !! Must try one of the dee-lish wraps here.Overall, the staff was helpful, and friendly, I will agree that the pool services was slow, but it just made me get up and go to the pool bar for my own pina coladas which was no big deal. Note, when ordering a pina colada (this is the place where they were originated) ask for extra spiced rum on top. Yumm !This place overall is somewhere I would return to again. And, we plan to very soon. Please do not listen to all the negative reviews. I give this resort a 4 out of 5.

<Content>Lame destination for vacation and overpriced at $265/night The Caribe Hilton is fine if you're on a business trip but I would recommend against staying there on vacation unless you like so-so accommodations surrounded by construction. We arrived early but we're checked in without incident. However, we were in the Condado Lagoon Villas which is quite a hike from the main lobby.The room itself was OK although we did not need the kitchen, fridge, etc. The bathroom needed to be overhauled and was very small. It felt as if we were in someone's timeshare instead of a hotel.The ground themselves are OK. Some of the buildings definitely could use repair and/or update. The beach is just OK. The 10% resort fee is a joke as it's not close to being a resort.I'd stay there if on business but definitely not for a vacation. There's nothing really close to it except for freeways and construction sites. It's $10 cab ride each way to Old San Juan which was interesting but overhyped.Head somewhere else in the Caribbean!

<Content>Could Have Been Better My husband and I just got back from staying at the Caribe Hilton(april 9-14th) we were there celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. The check in process was horrible when we arrived they upgraded us to a room in the towers and told us it was not ready it would be about 30 minutes so we went to the pool bar and had a delicious pina colda and a light lunch..food was ok. When we checked back about our room they told us it was going to be another 2o minutes..very poor service. The room was ok nothing to brag about but it served it's purpose. Several times on our trip our room key was disactivated very frustating especially after a long day you just want to relax in your room but you can't get in!!! We ate at the restaurants in the hotel our favorites were the Italian(service and food were great) and the Tapas restaurant also very good food. Breakfast was horrible from the food to the service, better off getting room service, you get your food a whole lot faster. We ate lunch a couple times at the Oasis Health Club, very good salads. The service in this hotel was very slow, we waited almost an hour for someone to take our drink order. Not all up to Hilton Hotel service at all. I don't think we would go back too many other great places to visit..not worth the money.

<Content>Great Getaway! We just got back from a 6 night, 6 day vacation from the Caribe Hilton and we loved it!There were many negative reviews on this website before I left and I was freaking out thinking we were going to hate the hotel. Needless to say, alot of the reviews were true, but you are on vacation and I would not let little things get me down. The hotel entrance is beautiful! Check in was smooth, but the bell boys or whatever you want to call the guys that hang out on in front of the hotel to help, are useless! The room was okay. Does it need a fresh coat of paint, yes, but who cares. Do the hallways have that humidity stench, yes, but why let that get you down! I was never in the hotel room or the hallways all that long during my stay and to pay double the price for a fancy room was not necessary (at least in my case). The pool and the beach were magnificiant. My sister-in-law warned me about the beach before I left, because when she stayed at the El San Juan, she claimed the beach was not that nice there. The beach here was beautiful and clean, but it was only for the Hilton hotel guests, so they cleaned it every night. The pool was a bit gross at the end of the day, but that is to be expected with so many kids in it. The pool was cleaned every night and I saw it with my own eyes and in the morning it was beautiful. They are defintely a bit short hand for help and are a bit slow by my standards, but friendly. So, I did not let it aggrevate me becasue I was on vacation. Other times, the help was very quick. It varied.There is no night life really and you have to venture out to eat unless you want to eat at the Hilton every night. We went into Old San Juan for two nights, Condado one night and Isle Verde another. Basically it was the same everywhere. We ate walked around a bit, nothing was opened and then went back to the hotel. You are not in walking distance of anyhting. We went to restaurants that were recommneded by the cab drivers or Hitlon employees. They were ALWAYS GREAT restaurants and cheap because they knew the area very well. If you are looking for night life, I can't help you because we did not see much or hear about much. The hotel could have done better in regards to the nighly music. It was okay, but if you had some good dancing music, I would have went to the hotel lobby area after dinner and had some drinks.We did two excursions, the rain forest and snorkling. I would skip the rain forest, but the snorkling was a lot of fun!Bottom line I expected the worse, and had a great time. Could I have stayed in a more lavish hotel, of course, but I rather the money be spent on drinks and food. I would defintely stay here again.If you have any questions, do not hesitate to e-mail me: nettya812@aol.com

<Content>Wonderful vacation Our Caribe Hilton Vacation was just wonderful. We just got back from the best vacation ever. We went with our 10 year old son and another family. We stayed in the towers. Our room was pretty and the hallways were decorated beautifully. We loved looking out at the beach and ocean everyday. You could even see Old San Juan in the distance. The lobby was gorgeous and we loved the pools and quiet beach. The staff was the friendliest staff we have ever had anywhere.I felt like I was in heaven the whole trip. I don't have one single complaint. I just hated to leave and I can't wait to visit the Caribe Hilton again. I don't see how anyone could not like this wonderful hotel!R.B. in Doylestown,PA.

<Content>overated and overpriced Because my company assigns the hotel's for it's employees I have no choice but to endure my brief but numerous overnights at the Caribe. My last visit featured a smoking room that I did not request, and the staff refused to change my room. Even after reporting a malfunctioning air conditioner, that did not budge from a 53 degree setting, I was forced to remain in this room. On the same floor one of my co-workers reported roaches in her room, and the staff failed to move her either. The rooms generally are mildewed, damp, and musty. You don't want to drink the water in San Juan, but if you need the bottled water in the room be ready to cough up $7.00. Need to get on the internet? That's going to cost you $14.95, excessive when you consider that many hotels are providing free WIFI/LAN as a service to their guests. For those of you that have a choice, go elsewhere.

<Content>Beautiful Caribe Hilton I've always loved the Caribe Hilton; I hadn't been there for a few years. In April I took my daughter and my two grand-daughters. They fell in love with it also. I prefer staying in the rooms in the main building because the rooms are spacious and have great views. The main building is also just steps from the beach area, main pool areas and the restaurants. We arrived late and the only rooms were in the Lagoon Villas section (has its own pool and garden area)but it's a bit of a hike to the beach and main pools so we asked to be changed to the main building. After two different rooms we were settled into the main building and had a great room and great water view. The staff was very accomadating; (I'm very picky about hotel rooms-especially when I am staying there for 6 nights!). The restaurants have wonderful food but very expensive. After the second day I discovered the bodega and deli across the street from the hotel. The $3.00 breakfasts and $4.00 lunches and sandwiches were delicious and very filling. The hotel's buffet breakfasts and dinners are exceptional if you want to pay the price. Meals at the hotel restaurant are free for young children and 50% discounted for older kids which is great. The daily activities are extensive and wonderful fun, both for children and adults. Make sure to take part in the daily free pina colada tastings that are offered at the pool bar. The hotel has become bigger and even more luscious than what it was a few years back and it's still beautifully maintained and so picturesque! My grand-daughters and daughter are already planning our trip to the Caribe for next year; we had to promise my son-in-law that he could come with us next year!

<Content>Wonderful Vacation After reading reviews of the Caribe Hilton we were prepared to have a so-so time on our vacation but were very happily surprised. Check-in was a breeze and we were quickly settled into a more than adequate room in the Towers. The room was large, modern and had a terrace with an exquisite ocean view. The bathroom had 2 sinks and a rain shower which was a wonderful experience. The king size bed was very confortable, which was a concern since my husband has back problems. The room was cleaned every day which included changing the sheets. We were more than comfortable in this room for the 6 nights we were there. We would recommend staying in the Towers rather than the Main, older building.The beach is in a cove which meant there were no waves, but waves could be seen in the distance. Umbrellas and chairs were always available even on the busy weekend. We thoroughly enjoyed the beach. We spent less time at the pool but it was very pretty with a swim-up bar and a jacuzzi, also a kiddy pool. We didn't bring children but there seemed to be lots of fun activities for them. Since we are Hilton Gold Card members we had access to the members lounge that had breakfast available in the morning and cocktails and food in the early evening, at no charge. We would also recommend the salad bar at the outdoor cafe in the lobby. There wasn't much to do outside of the hotel but an easy cab ride (about $10)could bring you into Old San Juan or to other hotels in the Condado area. All of the staff at the hotel were very courteous and polite. We truly had a wonderful time and we hope to go back again.

<Content>See for yourself I recently stayed at the Caribe from April 7th-April 11th. Before the trip we were skeptical from reading reviews on here, however after experiencing it for ourselves we are glad we decided to go. We loved this hotel. One criticism we had was at check-in. We booked a deluxe oceanview room and upon checking in we were almost given a gardenview room. Notice I said almost. When the girl at the desk said garden wing I pointed out her mistake. Next we were told that there weren't any deluxe oceanview rooms available. Lucky for us because we were upgraded to a room on the executive floor room #928. On this floor there is a lounge that serves complimentary continental breakfast in the morning, cocktails and hors d'ouevres in the evening and dessert and cordials at night. It was nice. Our room was great also. Everything was clean and everything worked. My only one complaint with the room was the shower, more specifically the water temperautre. It is either almost scalding hot or lukewarm, nothing in between. The view from our balcony was like something from a postcard. Every night we were brought mints and bottled water. The staff were helpful and attentive from the front desk to housekeeping, waitstaff to bellhops. The location of the hotel is great. From the airport it's a flat rate of $19 plus $1 per suitcase and $.50 per small bag. We paid $10 for a cab to Old San Juan and about $20 to Isla Verde. We rented a car and drove to El Yunque which took a little under an hour and it saved money. The tour is $49 per person. The rental was $57, entrance fee $3 and refilling the car about $7, so added up and divided we saved about $30 each (there were 4 of us). There are many dining choices at the Caribe. We tried the Atlantico pool bar and grill for burgers and light fare which was good. We also tried the Italian place which was good also, especially dessert.There is a Subway right outside the hotel entrance. If you want to venture out the concierge can offer suggestions and show you menus. Everyone should try the Parrot Club. The beach is ok, the sand is a bit rocky, but the pool is wonderful.It's a multi-level with waterfalls and a swim up bar. We did aqua aerobics one morning, one of the many activities offered by the hotel. One thing they don't offer is jetskiing. Overall, the trip was great. We're already plotting a return trip and the Caribe will be our 1st choice.

<Content>Not worth a long trip this hotel is more like a holiday inn with a good pool. folks there were nice but i would not recommend this hotel for a destination vacation. if you're going to be in puerto rico anyway and get a good deal on the hotel, then go for it. if you're traveling for a caribbean visit, i'd choose a different hotel with a nicer location and much more luxury. also, avoid the spa. i had poor service and an untrained provider.

<Content>can't go wrong at this hilton ... My wife and I stayed at the Caribe Hilton from April 6th to 10th ... We booked a room on the Executive Floor of the main tower. Check in was a breeze and although we arrived earlier than check in would allow, with access to the Exec Lounge we enjoyed cool drinks and snacks until our room was ready at about 2:00 P.M.Our room was lovely ... clean, king bed, balcony overlooking the ocean - just perfect.The first night we ate at Escambron, this restuarant is two blocks from the hotel, offered local fare, and the concierge gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. With a view of the Atlantic, the food was good and reasonable.We rented a car from the desk off the lobby, I called the 800 # and got a great rate, we even got an upgrade to a larger car ...We drove all over ... we went to Camuy Caves, Luguillo Beach, and had dinner in Old San Juan two nights ... It's very easy to get around when driving, and if you do have a car and want to park in OSJ there is a parking lot that charges $1.75 for two hours ... you can't miss this parking lot ... I think it's on Tetuan Street, and there are many restaurants right across the street from the parking garage ...The Hilton is wonderful ... the grounds are well kept, the pool was clean, the service and bars are good as well ...As HH Gold members we did receive comp buffet breakfast and a daily drink ... the breakfast is good (omelets, bagels and lox, champagne, etc ... etc ...) they do get $39.00 for two for this buffett, I would'nt pay that much but as HH members and included .. I'll take it!Victor at the bar in the lobby makes a great dirty Martini (according to my wife) and was very helpful in deciding to rent a car and drive ourselves to the places we went to ...The only complaint I have is that I have to go home ...There are negative reviews and the only thing my wife and I can figure out is that there are some people that are just not happy no matter what ...If you are on the fence about this property take the leap, you will not be dissapointed!Have fun! Enjoy your vacation ...

<Content>Loved everything about the Caribe Hilton Just returned from a weeks stay at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan. I must say that I was very concerned after reading some of the reviews prior to us going. Upon check-in our room wasn't ready so we did have to wait a few hours. This was really the only unpleasant experience we had and we just ended up having a drink while we waited. We ended up with a room in the newest part of the hotel the Lagoon. It was very nice and the view was incredible. Everyone we came in contact with was very nice and friendly. The grounds are very nice and clean too. I had read that the hotel was run down and in need of repairs. From what I saw the place was fine. I would recommend this hotel to familes with children and young adults. The grounds are very safe and I never worried about my teenage daughter walking around with her friend by themselves. I look forward to going back sometime in the future.

<Content>Many positives, few negatives I stayed with my 3 children and husband in March and overall it was a good trip and the hotel was exactly what we were looking for in nearly all respects. We stayed on the executive level and the room (jr suite) was fine for us. It was definitely not as upscale as I would have wanted if I were not traveling with my children, but with them it was okay that it wasn't fabulous. The executive lounge was a big plus for us traveling as a family. Breakfast was easy and it was a good place to stop in in the afternoon and get a soda or a coffee. I would definitely recommend paying extra for the executive lounge privilege. The cocktails in the evening were also nice and a good place to stop off before dinner. The staff on the executive floor was terrific and in fact the staff everywhere was top notch -- they got busy for a few days when a convention was in town and it was clear they were strained, but other than that they were great - helpful and incredibly friendly. The cleaning staff too was wonderful - friendly to our children and did a great job. The pool and beach were beautiful and nicely situated if you were with kids or without. The proximity of the hotel location to Old San Juan was also good and we could easily take a taxi there for dinner or otherwise - we did not feel trapped at the hotel by any means which was nice. It would have been ideal to have had a few more non-hotel restaurants in walking distance though. While the hotel was great for kids and families and I never felt too restrained in that regard (one reason we chose this hotel over the Ritz which might have been too nice for kids at my kids ages (1, 3 and 5), the kids activities were not anywhere near as good as billed and the kids' club was not open in March. They did have one night of free babysitting that was great but I would have liked to have had the option to drop my kids off a few mornings in a kids' camp - it would have made my vacation! I researched this vacation extensively and the reviews on trip advisor almost convinced me to stay elsewhere - I am glad that I didn't as I think that overall based on location, pools, staff etc, this was the best choice for our family with kids this young in PR and I think we will stay there again if we take childcare with us. BUT, if it had just been me and my husband, I would probably have chosen the Ritz.

<Content>Excellent Hotel and Great Staff ! Myself and a friend are both in the travel industry. We stayed at the Hilton Laguna Villas. The Villas are new and have excellent views of the ocean and Lagoon. The seperate check in and entrance is great and the staff is wonderful. Room service is excellent but can cost $$$. The resort is beautiful offering a nice private beach, a huge main pool, and the villas have their own small pool and spa, which although the villas pool has no bar, you can order whatever you like from room service and they will deliver it. The Hilton is a great resort and we would both return any time !!

<Content>Stay somewhere else! We used the Caribe Hilton as a stop over hotel for our vaction in the Virgin Islands, spending the first Friday and last Saturday nights at the hotel. Our experiences went from bad to worse. Both rooms were in the Executive floors. Not much to brag about since the executive floors are the same rooms on every other floor, dated and in need of an upgrade. The staff seemed uninformed about the hotel constantly asking for someone else to answer a question. Nobody seems to know anything including when hotel services and restaurants open or close. On our second visit to the hotel they made us wait over 2 hours to check into our room. At one point I needed to get the manager to actually send someone to clean the room. By the time I got my key they were still cleaning the room, making the bed and taking things outThis hotel needs an Extreme Makeover.

<Content>Ask For A Tower Room My husband and I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Caribe Hilton. We are Hilton Honors members so we were given a tower room. The first room we were given (room 1958) was horrible. It faced the construction site which was adjacent to the hotel. Though we were on the 19th floor we could hear the loud hammering and the room window vibrating due to the pounding below. All this noise started at 4:30am! We complained to the front desk and they did a good job of finding us another room which was much quieter(room 1568). If the tower rooms are suppose to be updated it scares me to think what the regular rooms look like. The pool was also dated and not kept very clean. In fact we preffered swimming with the fish in the pond instead of getting into the dirty pool. The service at the Atlantic Bar in the pool area was very good. The cheeseburgers and Caesar Salad was awesome! Try the lunch buffet at the Palmeras Restaurant. They served a lot of authentic Puerto Rican food. Overall if you are not going to spend much time in your room and you are on a budget this place is okay. If your budget allows you will have a much more enjoyable stay at the Ritz Carlton.

<Content>Condado Villa Review We selected the Condado Villas portion of the hotel even though it was quite spendy ($600 a night for the two bedroom option) because we wanted a place to accomodate two families with toddlers. The villas worked out fine...with some short comings.There is indeed a full kitchen and it is indeed fully equipped with appliances -- and nothing else. Unlike the Marriott condos, there is not a single fork, glass, dishrag, pan, or anything that might be helpful in preparing even a simple snack (a picky thing, but even the trash can was too small for kitchen purposes). This coupled with the lack of food markets within walking distance of the hotel made the kitchen pretty much useless for us. We only used the fridge for food that we we brought with us from home.The rooms are indeed nice and spacious though some things are lacking such as comfortable (and abundant) seating in the common room. Also, we had trouble with all three of the toilets even though this is a very new complex. It is a long-ish walk to the main pools and the beach though there is a small but not so fancy (it looks like a backyard pool) pool adjacent to the villas. A nice touch is the staffed towel stand at the villas pool. If we had it to do again, we would probably do a private rental of a similar unit at the Westin, some of which cost much less for similar or even nicer units. I might also consider using Priceline and getting three connecting rooms for basically the same effect -- two bedrooms and a common room.We were traveling with two two-year olds and had a grand time with the pools and the beach and the birds. The buffet breakfast was loaded with kid-friendly foods though it was a little high for the adults ($20). In Old San Juan, we had great meals at Cafe Puerto Rico and Jibarito. We liked the food at Al Dente but were put off by the fact that they only had one high chair and the somewhat high prices for decent but not spectacular food.

<Content>Overall good time Me and my girlfriend stayed at the Caribe Hilton this past weekend. We booked on expedia for $210 a night, which was a great deal given the cost of other Puerto Rican hotels. If you're looking for a weekend getaway this place will do the trick. The rooms in the tower are perfectly fine. We found the room to be completely spacious and clean, and the ocean view fantastic. The open air lobby and bar are pretty as are the hotel grounds. The beach is by far the selling point: the water is beautiful. Not a problem getting a beach chair. Ive stayed at the Water Club, the El San Juan and have been in the Intercontinental. I don't think that either of those hotels are any nicer than the Caribe Hilton although they are atleast $200 more a night. The only thing to complain about here is the service - a couple of times we sat around waiting for a waiter to come by to give us menus, to take our order, or deliver the drinks for more than 15 minutes. Management seems to be part of the problem. We noticed alot of people just standing around chatting with each other while guests clearly waited for service. The workers seemed oblivious. Of course we just (--) to ourselves, and had a laugh. We were really there for the beach and if we were paying more per night we would have been really pissed, but at $210 we overlooked the bad service. Food at the pool bar is fine grill food (burgers, etc). The prices are the same as at any hotel pool bar. I wouldn't eat at the hotel restaurants given that there are many better and cheaper restaurants on the island (in old san juan and condado). And finally, this place was completely gay friendly. My girlfriend and I held hands and kissed and didn't catch any glances or double takes. We also spotted alot of family.

<Content>Not worth the $$$ We had a marvelous 14 days in Puerto Rico! We began our visit with a 3 night stay at the Hilton Ponce. While there we visited a coffee plantation, the Serrales Castle, El Yunque Rainforest, and the town of Ponce. We then rented a house near Cidra which was a beautiful rural setting in the mountains. Our last three nights were spent at the Caribe Hilton.As a Diamond member of Hilton, we have stayed at Hiltons everywhere. At $355 a night I expected a lot more for our money. The room was in the Towers but the quality was dissapointing. The toilet paper holder was broken, there were some scary stains on the walls, and the maid broke the doorhandle to the balcony when she tried to close it. While a maintenence person did come repair it, it was an obtrusion of our time and privacy. The walls in the hallway were also marred with stains. On the plus side, the bed was heavenly. My husband did have to wait ten minutes every morning for hot water in what was otherwise a beautiful shower. The beach is ideal for traveling with a family - protected from the pounding surf of the bay, the lagoon provides a gentle play area for children. The hotel provides sand toys at no cost. The pools are beautiful but there is only one hot tub. It looked like there were two but the second wasn't heated. There are additional activities posted although they don't always offer what they promise. My children were dissapointed when the posted sand castle building activity wasn't held. My biggest complaint with the hotel was the service. It seems the Caribe is catering to convention travelers. The hotel was crammed with two seperate conventions during our stay. When we made any inquiries the staff was generally rushed, haried, and even on ocasion, rude. If I were there on convention paying a reduced rate, or enjoying a stay at the cost of my company, this wouldn't be such an issue. However, as a guest paying premium rates, this level of service wasn't acceptable. Other guests I spoke to voiced the same concerns without any prompting.Don't visit the Caribe expecting to be anything more than a room number. Their size has outgrown their level of service and the maintenence of the rooms.

<Content>A very pleasant surprise I just returned from a five night stay at the Caribe Hilton, and was dreading it after reading some of the reviews on this site. I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised, especially since I tend to stay at high end hotels like Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons. I had to go to the Caribe Hilton for a meeting and decided to bring my family; I am very glad I did. We were given a new, immaculate room in the Condado Lagoon Villas with an ocean view and a HUGE bathroom, despite the fact that I was paying the meeting rate. (I did sign up for the free Hilton Honors the day before we checked in; I don't know if that made a difference.) Across the board, the staff was very friendly and the service was timely. (This goes for restaurants, pool, beach, housekeeping.) Even when my 5-year old daughter got sick with bronchitis, they were quick with getting us a doctor and changing the sheets that she threw up upon!! There is a lot for kids to do. The pool is beautiful, though a little chilly from the wind. The beach is small, but the water is calm and you can relax while watching the kids instead of fearing for their lives in the pounding surf elsewhere on the island. The garden area with the koi pond and strolling peacocks was great. We took the 1/2 day trip to the rainforest- well worth it. We ventured to a couple other hotels: the El San Juan in Isla Verde was spectacular (eat at La Piccola Fontana!!); the Condado Plaza across the bridge from the Caribe Hilton was not and seemed better suited for Atlantic City than San Juan. I hadn't been to the Caribe Hilton since I was six years old (I'm 35 now) and was expecting it to be a shabby shell of its former self. It most certainly is not, and though I would be interested in trying the Ritz or the El San Juan next time, I'd gladly go back.

<Content>Not Like it Used to Be We have been to this hotel twice. I can tell you that the first time i went in the 90's, I had no complaints. I just went now in 2005 and it wasnt like i remembered. It was still nice. It had parrots and starbucks and nice things in the lobby. the ocean was also very nice. there were plenty of fish to see and a cool slide in the middle of the ocean (it used to have nice tanning blocks instead of the slide). I had no complaints about the gym or the spa either. The only complaints i had was mainly the room. the room was clean but it wasnt a very welcoming room but it was comfortable and average. the food was good but VERY expensive. We traveled in a group of 8 and spent about $900.00 per dinner and $45.00 per breakfast. Make sure you go to Mortons steakhouse. it is expensive but it has pictures of many celberties who have been there before. its a nice place....the rooms might be your only problem but it was still pretty good.P.S. there were many rain showers while we were there that lasted for about 5 minutes so dont get worried about it.

<Content>Much nicer than I had expected We just got back on Feb. 27th from a week at the Caribe Hilton. After reading all of the reviews on this site, I was not looking forward to our trip there for a conference. But, I was pleasantly surprised. We had no problems checking in and were given a room in the Tower (Rm. 1762), which had a beautiful view of the beach and old San Juan in the distance. The bathroom was fabulous, with a marble and glass walk-in shower, with two types of showerheads -- a hand-held, and a rain-type one overhead. The room was clean and new and the only thing that had a musty smell were the pillows on one of the beds. But, our other ones were fine. We got turn-down service the first night, with a bottled water and mints left for us.During the week, the beach and pool area were relatively quiet, and we enjoyed the grounds and pool-side bar and grill. While not that big, the beach area was nice and the water was calm (although it can be quite windy by the pool). It was very family-oriented, with activites for the kids, but not overwhelming. The atmosphere did change on he weekend, when they played loud music all day and there were a lot of kids running around, as another reviewer had said. We loved the breakfast buffet. It was a bit pricey at 19.50 a person, but the food was quite good and varied, with some local specialties, too. It was nice to have a Starbucks there, too.All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. At night, there was live music in the bar area, and one evening the Puerto Rico Philharmonic Orchestra played there, which we could watch for free. I'm happy to say we had a great time here.

<Content>Caribe Hilton: What have they done to this beautiful place? We went to the Caribe Hilton january 14, 2006 for 7 days.What have they done to this place?Background: I have been going to the caribe Hilton since i was a child. I loved this place. My father used to take us here every other summer. I was last here as an adult in 1999. We went back again on jan 14, 2006 for 7 days. I hate this place now. This could be any cookie-cutter hotel in south beach. Neon everywhere. What does Bright Neon have to do with a tropical resort anyway. I felt like I was on a Carnival Cruise Ship, instead of a 5 star resort.They removed the most famous lobby bar in puerto rico and replaced it with this bright neon area. Remember, This is where the Pina-Colada was invented by a bartender here in the late 50's. All of the tropical feel has been removed. The terraced tables and the orchastra area have also been removed. There is no more 30 piece orchastra anymore, just a 3 piece trio. There is no puerto rican tropical atmosphere here anymore.Rooms: We booked a 1 bedroom suite in the main bldg. This room, while it had a magnificent view, was old and not very well taken care of. Upon arrival, we had small red ants everywhere in BOTH bathrooms. They sent up a maid with a can of ant killer. This is how thay took care of this. I am paying over $ 800.00 per night for a room that has thousands of ants, and the best they can do is send up smoe poor maid with a can of Raid! I felt soooo bad for this maid having to breath in those fumes. Now the both rooms smell of ant killer spray. There were many cracks in the wood fixtures in the room. The door to the TV cabinet was falling off. The bed had a wood block under on of the legs to keep it up. Another wood block under the night table stand to keep it level. The mini bar had an 2 opened bottles in it. One was water, the other was coca-cola. Both were opened and put back into the minibar. This is a club-level room. I went to the club level receprion and very nicely and calmly complained. I was told that there was nothing they could do. Can you belive this. I have a room in this condition, and there is nothing they could do!Pools/Beach; It seems that they now sell passes to local residents for the pool/beach area. Everytime we went to the pool, we were asked to sign-in this got to be a hassel after the first few times. It is not only when you use the pool/beach, you must give your room number everytime you step out the door to the pool deck area. The pool deck area is VERY loud. There are local kids running everywhere and screaming at the top of their lungs. This is not what I paid for in a vacation. The pool/beach area is beautiful, but the atnosphere is horrible. not relaxing what so ever.Food: The food is good at every place we ate. I really do have high marks for the food/wait staff. I just wish they could be in a better hotel/resort that this newly refurbished hilton.We arrived on saturday. We spent saturday night and sunday night here. I woke up monday morning and realized I had enough of paying so much for this and not getting anywhere close to what was promised. I checked into the availability at the El Conquistodor. I was told that they had plent of rooms available. We checked out of the Hilton with 5 days left in our vacation and checked into the el conquistodor. This was the best decision we made. The el Conquistodor was beautiful. EVERYTHING was as it should have been:Beautiful hotel.beautiful roomGreat foodLots to do Not day passes for locals with screaming children.I know that this sounds snobbish, but when you are paying over $ 6,000 for a 7 day vacation, you just want it to be right, not to be disappointed at everything you thought it was going to be.Believe me, I am a person who over reasearches every place we go. I have never complained about a vacation in my life. My feeling is thatI am on vacation and I'm going to have a goo time no matter what happens. I was compleatly blindsided by the Caribe Hilton. The changes thay made must have been done by some corporate exec because they took the tropical Puerto rican feeling out of this place. It might as well be the Fontainbleu in Miami.A suggestion for anyone who is booked here: DO NOT STAY IN THE MAIN BLDG. ASK FOR A ROOM IN THE TOWER BLDG.I have stayed in the Tower before, it is MUCH better than the Main Bldg.We went to jamaica at the end of january, it was MUCH better than this.

<Content>great trip We were at the Carribe Hilton from Feb. 18-24th and had a great time. We were on the 10th floor of the main hotel and our room was fine. We were there with our two children (6 and 8years old) and they loved it. They loved the pool, beach, the big chess set, kids activities and much more. We mainly ate away from the hotel but had breakfast at Hiltons Honors lounge which was fine for a light breakfast and saved money. I would not hesitate to go back and am not sure why there were so many bad reviews. Don't worry about it if your planning a trip there soon because I think you'll have a great time.

<Content>What a disappointment! We stayed at this hotel right after our cruise on the Golden Princess...and what a disappointment. We had to wait 2 hrs. to be checked in, due to a holiday they were celebrating that weekend. We'd requested a queen/king bed with an ocean view, and were promised a nice room...well, we were put in the tower, susposedly the new part, which took about 7 minutes to walk to, (not good for hip or back problems due to inclines in their hallways...)and when we walked into our room, fruit flies were there to greet us due to garbage left in the bathroom garbage can, towels missing off the racks, black long hair on the floor and in the tub, kids' handprints all over the balcony windows...and the ocean view we were expecting ended up being a construction site, complete with all the noise.The carpet was dirty with black scuffs all over, and every wall had dirty hand prints and scuff marks all over them too. Are the maids forgetting what the word clean means?? The pictures even hung crooked, and there was no mirror in the room, only the one in the bathroom.When we tried to take a shower, there was NO hot water. Disgusted, after the water being colder than the ocean, we called the front desk with our complaints numerous times, and even tho they assured us someone would come to our service...no one ever showed up until the following afternoon. It was then that we discovered the hot and cold were reversed...and this is supposed to be a $400 room????? In their dreams...NEVER AGAIN!! I've stayed in nicer motel rooms! What a disappointment!ps. The beach is very small with nowhere to walk to. The restaurants are very expensive as well.My advice if you HAVE to stay here, is check the room before you take it! You are definately paying for the Hilton name and the resort grounds...not the rooms!

<Content>Overpriced, moldy, musty hotel We were very excited to be going to Puerto Rico, durring the winter. What a disapointment when we checked into the hotel.The room was small, but had a balcony with a side view of the ocean. The first morning that we were there, we had a flood in our bathroom from the bathroom above. We called and were told that the plumbing above us, had been diverted incorectly. I don't even know what that means! Anyway, 4 hours later, they still hadn't come to fix the problem. We asked for a new room and were told that there were none available. My husband then went down to the front dest to complain. We were finaly given another room. The rest of the time we were there, they never even called to apologize, or ask if they could do anything else. It was as if they really didn't care. The floor we were on, #5 of the main building, had a distinct musty odor when the elevator doors opened. The other couple that got off when we did, noticed it too. There were small chunks of the walls that were gone on the corners in the hallways. The rest of the walls were stained and in bad need of a new paint job.There was only one working elevator for the 5 nights that we stayed there. It took 10-15 minutes to get up to your room or down to the lobby. You were allowed to use the service elevator, which leads off of the main kitchen. After seeing the kitchen, I'm glad we didn't eat at any of the facility restaurants.When we checked out, we were shocked to see the additional charges. There was a $24.00 resort fee, a $4.50 bellman fee, and a .50 maid fee. They also had blocked all of the wi fi services, and we were forced to use their internet service for $14.95/night.We will definetly never go back to that hotel. We paid $285.00/night, and it was not worth the money. Not only was this hotel in need of many repairs, but the employees were rude, and didn't seem to care one way or another about the guests. When we checked out, they didn't even ask if everything was alright. Even the Holiday Inn asks that at checkout! Oh well, live and learn.

<Content>Not worth the price, if you're paying full nightly rate. We stayed at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan, Puerto Rico from Feb 14th to the 16th, for our best friends' wedding. At check-in, the process was smooth and fast, but hotel did not honor our confirmed reservation for a King size bed. We stayed on the main building, and on the 4th floor; which had a terrible moldy smell throughout our entire stay. Housekeeping was very inconsistant with clean-up times, and even neglected to clean our room on Valentine's day, when we had been out all day and into late at night due to the wedding. Food choices at the main restaurant, for breakfast and lunch, were very boring and bland. The Islita Grounds is a great location for a sea-side wedding, and the hotel does offer great vendors and wedding planners. Overall, the Caribe Hilton is not worth the $340 per night full rate. Luckily, the hotel is conveniently placed between Condado and Old San Juan, so if you stay here on a cheap rate, go to either area for food. We would not stay here again, but would definitely return to Puerto Rico staying @ The Ritz Carlton or The Conquistador like we have before.

<Content>Hated to leave I concur with other recent reviews. My stay here was great. Our flights were cancelled due to the snow in the northeast and the Caribe made it very easy for us to book the rooms again. We also stayed in the Towers, which were lovely, modern, very clean and the service all around was great. The beach/pool area is also lovely and we ended spending most of our day there (with a nice pina colada too). I would not hesitate to return.

<Content>I would totally go back I definitely worried about the Hotel after reading all the mixed reviews. I just came back and totally enjoyed my stay and experience. My 2 girlfriends and I planned a long weekend that ended up being longer due to the storm in NYC.We stayed in the newer part of the the Hotel...The Towers. Granted we paid a little extra. The bathroom was great all marble, rain shower and very clean. The staff in the hotel I felt was very nice and accomodating. Our return flight was very late at night and they let us stay until 7pm for a very reasonable fee.We loved the grounds really didn't feel the need to go anywhere else during the day. The beach is man made however very nice with a great view, the pool was fabulous. Just get down a little earlier to put a towel down on a chair in a good sun locationWe ate at the hotel 2 nights..the tapas place was great and Lemongrass was also fabulous. Great atmosphere in the tropical garden. The restaurants are expensive however coming from NYC it did not phase me and I feel well worth it.I would go back again do not listen to all the bad reviews...so overly critical.

<Content>san juan hilton is great! My sons and i had a fantastic vacation at the caribe. Ali, the night manager is the greatest. he takes care of business. there is a little store at the end of the driveway that has the best food, and drinks (cheap) and delicious. I brought some stew home for my husband, but ate it on the airplane. I did not want to leave. I love San Juan. Forget Laguillo beach. falling apart, but you might enjoy a coco loco out of the coconut.Would go back today but prices are high.

<Content>Wonderful We just got back from a 4 day get away. What a wonderful experience. The Hilton was relaxing and easy. We found everyone to be very nice, friendly and helpful. Thanks to other reviews we had a lot of hints to help us. Although we booked through priceline I called the hotel directly and gave them our Hilton Honors number. They now have a section of the renovated tower just for Hilton Honors members. Although our room was not large,it was great. I loved the shower and the view of the pool and the fort. At night we shut off the air conditioner and slept with the balcony door wide open. We ate outside the hotel. There was a little , hole-in the wall place just outside the hotel (40 ft). We love to find little local places to eat. One of our favorites was Casita Blanca in Villa Palerma. You need a car to get there but it was very local and very good.It took us less than 10 min. to get there. We could not have found nicer people or better food. We also ate at the Ocean View, an open air local place near the El Conquestidor in Farado right across from we you meet the guides for foing to the bioluminesct bay. We also had homemade desserts after we were done kayaking. The kayaking through the mangroves and in the bay was unbeliveable. But I put on bugspray going out but forgot that it would wash off while swimming. I am still itching!!!!! for the brave - we drove through Pinyones on Sunday Afternoon - what a blast. Very local. Tons of Puerto Ricans, food, music. It is definately the place to be on Sun. Another recommendation - El Morro Fort late in the afternoon. It was so un real. In the large grassy park/knoll ther were lots of families flying kites. it was very slightly misty and we lay on the grass watching the scene as the sun set. People can't believ that I took the pictures - they look like professional pictures.We love puerto Rico and may even take the kids next time.

<Content>mixed opinion this is supposed to be one of the best hotels in San Juan. This grounds are beautiful. The pools  beaches were great. The service on the grounds were great. The maid service I experienced was TERRIBLE. My cell phone was mistakingly taken by the maid service. Instead of sending it to security, the people decided to meet with me instead. This never happend because of the punctuality problem they have. I waited 2 days for my phone. It wasn't until I was arguing with the security manager. (which I had to find myself, since concierge was giving me the run-around and telling me to call housekeeping. how about you do it! you're the concierge. that's your job!) Anyway, the security manager asked why i didn't have the phone in the safe in my room. My reply- THERE WAS NO SAFE IN THE ROOM!!!! How am I supposed to protect my valuables when there's no way? He said he would put a safe in the room that night. It never happened.Long story short, the service at this place is OK. Some people were extremely helpful, but the handful of people I had to deal with regarding my phone really left a bad impression.If I were to visit Puerto Rico again, I would choose another hotel.

<Content>Don't read any of the bad reviews...they are all wrong! I have traveled to many different islands in the Caribbean and stayed with many well known hotel chains! I know what I am talking about and just stayed at the Caribe Hilton for my honeymoon with my husband. All of these people with their stupid little complaints had me so scared that my honeymoon was going to be ruined!!!! Don't listen to them!We booked by an accepted offer on Priceline (paid half of what the hotel was advertising on major websites), got a beautiful room in the tower with a view of the ocean and the fort, with a balacony and chairs to sit on. Our bathroom was beautiful tan marble tile throughout and had dual sinks with a large all glass stand up shower, with two different shower heads (choose your preference) and teak/bamboo accents! Our bedlinens, curtains, and valance were all VERY up-to-date and beautiful!We got a local newspaper every morning at our door and they were even upgrading all the TVs throughout the hotel during our stay at the end of January.The grounds are beautiful. The service at all bars, restaurants, and poolside were teriffic!! If you really read some of these reviews, pay close attention to what people complain about!!! Its trivial and stupid! If they were that upset about those things to write such long and daunting reviews....imagine what they must be like to deal with in person!!!! Of course they will catch some attitude from hotel employees!!! (and in my opinion...rightfully so!!If anyone would be treated badly or have horrible accomadations it would have been me and my husband b/c of the price we paid for it!!!! We kept saying...I feel like we stole this vacation!Oh and by the way.......Apparently of all the hotels in the area, this is the only one that was good enough for JENNIFER LOPEZ and MARC ANTHONY b/c they stayed 9 floors above us the entire week we were there b/c they were shooting a movie in Old San Juan. We personally saw them a couple of times and talked with two of their assistants in casual conversation!

<Content>A little dated but great service My wife and I went to the Caribe for our 20th wedding anniversary. We found the check in efficent (although they would not allow us to check in formally until after 4:00- turned out to be 4:30)and as a HH member they upgraded us immediately to the Tower. Over our week long visit we had several opportunites to request services and it was always delivered quickly and with a smile. we were made to feel special.As has been noted in other reviews, the facility is a bit dated but we found the service level far in excess of our expectations and this more than made up for it.The only negitive I have was the restaurants. Although the food was good and the service decent, the value for the price was not there.

<Content>Not a good place I was at the Carribe Hilton for a business conference Jan 22-27, 2006, and it was not a good experience. When I arrived at 5:30 on a Sunday, the front desk gave me their standard check in card saying the room would be ready by 4, or perhaps earlier: they then told me it would not be ready for an hour. I finally got a room at 7:30, with no explanation, no upgrade. The room itself was on the 7th floor of the tower. It was large enough, but quite dated. The TV was small and set into a cabinet on a side wall, so you had too look sideways from the bed, and if you sat in the easy chair you were all the way on the other side of the room. There was no light by that chair, so you couldn't sit there and read in the evening. The bathroom fixtures were sort of dirty and not well made; the toilet also tended to flush itself at odd hours, quite loudly. The view was of the lagoon, which was just a small lake with construction going on. The phones in my room were faulty, as often you could not hear anything, and sometimes they would fail in the middle of a call, forcing me, once I realized that the other party hadn't heard me for awhile, to call out again. It took 2 days to get them to replace the phones, and that brought another problem. They charge $1.25 per outgoing call. I went to the front desk to ask them to take off 2 of those charges, as they resulted from the hotel's phone failing in mid-call and my having to recall; if their phones worked correctly, I wouldn't have had to recall and incur the extra expenses. The front desk woman flat refused, arguing that I had made the calls and the charges were the charges. I eventually called (after I got phones which worked) the head of communications, and after several calls and messages she agreed to deduct the unnecessary charges. At my group business meeting the lights didn't work correctly, and after several days of trying to get the hotel people to fix it, our group organizer gave up. Overall, this place may have been nice back when it opened in 1949, but it isn't now, and the front line people are rude and unhelpful.

Meals expensive and sort of out of the way to walk other places but the beach and bars excellent. Getting around was ok due to friendly people eager to help out.

<Content>The Caribe Hilton is both a hit and a miss My husband and I just returned from a week long stay at the Caribe Hilton. My husband is a Diamond Member of Hilton Honors and this stay was reward travel with HHonor points. The Caribe Hilton was not our first choice, initially we booked our reservations at the Cancun Hilton Golf  Spa resort. The Cancun Hilton informed us in November that the resort would not be operational by mid-January after Hurricane Wilma had damaged the area and resort. Upon reading many of the mixed reviews here, we weren鈥檛 sure we had made the best decision and our expectations were not too high.We arrived mid-afternoon and were pleased to discover when we checked in that we had been upgraded to the Condado Lagoon Villas. We were told we couldn鈥檛 get into our room until 4:00 pm, so we checked our luggage with the bellhop, walked around the grounds a little bit and finally headed up to the HHonor Executive Floor for a snack. The concierge on the Executive Level was incredibly hospitable. She welcomed us, told us a bit about the hotel, the area, including Old San Juan and Condado and checked with housekeeping a handful of times to check the status of our room and finally advised us that our room was ready. The room itself was acceptable, there was nothing exceptional worth noting, though the king size bed and pillows were very comfortable for a hotel. The air conditioner was incredibly loud, to the point you could barely hear the TV over it and the ceiling fan was rather rickety. Both of these problems could easily be resolved with routine maintenance. The bathroom was very spacious and nicely appointed with both a decent size walk-in shower and a large soaking tub. There were double sinks and the toilet itself ( bidet) was in a separate room, which is always nice. The room featured a small balcony, large enough to stand on, but not large enough for any patio furniture, etc. but did offer a fabulous view of the water, the San Geronimo Fort and Condado. Be advised that the rooms in The Villas do adjoin and you can often hear what is happening in the room next to you, especially if there is a child that raises his or her voice or a parent correcting them.If you are a Gold or Diamond Member of HHonors I would definitely encourage you to take advantage of the Executive Lounge on the 9th Floor of the main hotel building. We aren鈥檛 big breakfast eaters, so we were content with the complimentary continental breakfast that was offered daily. Other offerings throughout the day include soft drinks and cookies / fruit in the afternoon, cocktails and crudit茅s / small appetizers in the early evening and finally cordials and dessert after 8:00 pm. We found service from the staff to be exceptional. The bartenders and servers we encountered at Atlantico, the pool bar  grill where we ate most lunches, were wonderful and we had two fabulous servers when we ordered Room Service. The Housekeeping Staff was also quite accommodating. A handful of times they arrived before we had left for breakfast or the pool or we came back mid-day and they had not yet finished our room, they were always polite and happy to come back 15 or 30 minutes later to give us the time we needed. In addition, the nightly turn down service was very nice. The bellhops were always pleasant and helpful too. Again, the Concierge staff on the Executive Level was very helpful. We also visited Las Olas Spa for massages and had good service there.I wish the same could be said for Management at the Caribe Hilton. As I said, we stayed at the hotel for one week, after our first night there we awoke to find a bill and information about express check-out had been slipped under our door. The front desk staff apologized for the error and confirmed they did, in fact, have us staying for one week. Several morning we did not receive a newspaper after trying to resolve the issue with the front desk, we spoke with the Manager on Duty who was less than helpful and simply stated that he would, 鈥淟ook into it.鈥?The Concierge desk in the main hotel lobby was hit or miss, twice we received excellent suggestions for restaurants off-site, but one staff member in particular was quite rude and flippant. When my husband inquired about taking a small plane or helicopter tour of the island (both of which he said were unavailable, which is odd, considering the HHonor Executive Level Concierge said they would be happy to arrange it for us, seems like the Concierge in the lobby was simply unwilling to go the extra mile) or possibly going skydiving he replied, 鈥淵ou can鈥檛 go sky diving on Fifth Avenue.鈥?Obviously we understood that San Juan is a city and you can鈥檛 go skydiving in the middle of it, but his response was inappropriate rather than asking if we meant somewhere outside the city limits. One day prior to our departure we paid for the bulk of our stay (resort fee, room charges, etc.) with Traveler鈥檚 Check. To date, 3 days after our return home, the accounting department has yet to credit our bank account for the over $600 in erroneous authorization charges despite the fact most our bill was paid in cash. While this is already an inconvenience, it becomes even more annoying since the hotel does not offer a toll-free telephone number and we are forced to call Puerto Rico repeatedly to resolve this matter. The last night of our stay we called to arrange a late check-out for the following day. Check-out is at 12 noon, we were requesting one additional hour, we were told that they could not accommodate us. When pressed they said that our room was booked for the next day; while I understand that housekeeping needs time to clean and turn over a room, I find it hard to believe that allowing us one extra hour would create that much of an inconvenience when they are very strict with not allowing anyone to check-in until 4:00 pm. We dined at both Morton鈥檚 and Lemongrass onsite, neither are owned or operated by the hotel. Both meals were fantastic, but be forewarned you can not charge the meal to your room. Of course this is not a big deal, but good to know in advance. Speaking of not being able to use your room charge, you can not use it in the Sundries shop, Starbucks or the Cigar Shop, which can be a bit inconvenient if you don鈥檛 know ahead of time. The 鈥楥igar Shop鈥?if you can call it that, was basically a hodgepodge of everything with a small humidor / cigar selection. One night my husband wanted a cigar, but discovered the Cigar Shop was closed. The Concierge informed him that Morton鈥檚 sold cigars and he discovered that their cigars were less expensive (by almost half!) and was pleased with their selection. Very convenient should you decide you want a cigar in the evening after dinner. Of course you can use your room charge at the restaurants operated by the Caribe Hilton. As I mentioned, we ate lunch at Atlantico almost daily. Yes, the food is a little overpriced as I鈥檝e seen people complain about here; but it goes with the territory, you鈥檙e at a hotel! If you鈥檝e ever traveled before and / or lived in or worked in a major metropolitan area, the prices shouldn鈥檛 be a surprise. One rainy afternoon we had lunch at the Oasis Bar, the same holds true. We did not dine at any of the other restaurants on premise, so I can鈥檛 comment on them. Also, please note that the Oasis Bar is currently being remodeled and is only partially open at this time. The grounds of the resort are well maintained and we didn鈥檛 have any difficulty obtaining a chaise by the beach or the pool. The pool can get a little crowded, but it was never so bad that we couldn鈥檛 get a seat. All in all, we would return to San Juan, but not to the Hilton. As we were staying on HHonor points and not paying for our stay it was easy to overlook some of the problems / inconveniences up to this point; however, the accounting errors are inexcusable.

<Content>Hilton Caribe - really recomend it. Just got back from a week at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan. We got a great deal through Priceline. Normally when we travel with Priceline, we get the worst rooms (fair enough - we're paying much less). Based on reviews I had read on here, I wrote to the hotel before we left and asked for a more modern room in the tower part of the hotel. A bit cheeky and I didn't expect them to give it to us. We arrived at about 15.30 and went to check in. We were told that check in time had been changed to 1600 and that we could either wait for the room that had been assigned to us or take another one that was already ready (but clear indication that the room that was ready was not as good). We chose to wait and had a drink by the beautiful pool. We got into our room shortly after 1600. It was fabulous!! In the tower part of the hotel with a full view of the ocean. Very clean, very modern and in excellent condition. Good balcony with seating area overlooking the beach. The best was the bathroom which was massive and had a great 'rain' shower, two sinks etc. We couldn't have been happier. Room was cleaned thoroughly every day and papers delivered in the morning. The rest of the hotel was also excellent. Pool area was great and the beach, whilst not the best by Caribbean standards, was not bad and not many people there. Gym was also really great - overlooking the sea so you feel like you are running into the ocean. Staff were all helpful thoughout. Hotel is located in an great place - between Condado and Old San Juan - within walking distance of both so you have many options for dinner.All in all, I'd recomend this place without hesitation. Whilst I am glad I didn't pay full price for the room, I suspect I would have been pleased even if I had.

<Content>Would not go back. We stayed at the Caribe Hilton from 12/24/05 through 12/31/05. The rooms were musty and smelled like cat urine (9th Floor Tower). They definitely need to be updated. It was either too hot or too cold in the room. We could NEVER get a chair by the pool no matter how early we tried. We ended up carrying our own chairs, table, etc. into the muddy grass every day. It really didn't feel like a pampered vacation at all. I must say that the staff was very nice. This is not the place for couples. It is definitely more kid and family friendly.

<Content>I love Puerto Rico This past June my husband and sister-in-law had the pleasure of traveling to Puerto Rico. We were booked on a Carnival cruise through the Southern Caribbean and our port was San Juan. We wanted to take advantage of this beautiful port, so we flew down three days before our cruise.I had always dreamed of visiting Puerto Rico and I was not disappointed when I finally got there.I had read several reviews on Trip Advisor about the various hotels in the greater San Juan area. It took me a long time before I finally settled on the Hilton Caribe.After arriving in San Juan we quickly decided after the taxi ride from the airport to rent a van. We were given directions to the hotel and we were able to find it fairly easily.The hotel is situated in a very desirable part of the city close to Old San Juan and other attractions. I loved the open air lobby when we arrived. You had immediate views of the atrium, patios and the ocean beyond.Our check in was very painless since I had called ahead and requested a room in the new tower. We had our bags taken upstairs while we enjoyed a light dinner in the bar area.The hotel was abuzz with activity that particular evening because we kept noticing limos pulling up and the most luminous dresses I have ever seen. After inquiring about what was going on, we learned that a highschool graduation was taking place in one of the ballrooms.Our room was located on the 16th floor. We had partial city and bay views, which were quite nice. The room was spacious and clean, with plenty of closet space and a nice balcony with chairs. The bathroom was the best part I thought because of the beautiful marble in the shower. The shower itself could hold a football team it was so large!I took advantage of many of the ameneties and services on site at the hotel. I enjoyed a great workout in the gym and an emergency manicure at the spa. We ate frequently at Morton's and the lovely patio restaurant for breakfast.Since we were in Puerto Rico to explore we spent a lot of time away from the hotel. I can say however that I had no complaints. The hotel has some great jewelry boutiques where I found and purchased a one of a kind ring. They have a Starbucks on site for coffee fiends and overall we had a very enjoyable experience. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Nice hotel - Excellent service Stayed at Caribe Hilton during Christmas holiday with my family. Always crowded at resorts during this busy week, and that is exactly what we got. Having said this we were very pleased with the service of staff throughout the property. Check in was without incident. Rooms were ready and in the part of the hotel we expected. We stayed in the main building. Our room was clean and comfortable, although a bit tired. We ate at four of the hotel restaurants during out stay and they were very good. The pool area and beach were comfortable. Travelled to Old San Juan and Candado several times via a quick cab ride. Would recommend this property to others who are looking for an above average experience, close to the excitement of Old San Juan and Candado. Thank you Caribe Hilton

<Content>Great Getaway Reading some of these reviews I almost feel as though I stayed at a different hotel than the other people with negative comments. I loved the Caribe Hilton, and thought the staff was extremely accommodating (even though there were huge crowds because of the Christmas holiday they made you feel as though you were the only one). I travel all over the world and this hotel truly is tops. I was upgraded to a room in the executive towers (Hilton HHonors Diamond member) and it was terrific. Great shower, spacious room and very clean. The free breakfast and appetisers were quite a treat. Not many hotels treat their loyal customers so well and I appreciate that. The beach is small but very calm. I especially liked the shady area. Having such a palm tree retreat is a rarity and allowed for my own personal getaway away from the holiday crowds. I would stay here again.

<Content>Enjoyed the stay overall We just returned from a pre-holiday visit to Puerto Rico and stayed at the Caribe Hilton and I must say I am surprised by the terrible reviews. We received an upgrade to an ocean view (even despite a 15 minute wait) and thought the room was average, not $400 a night good, but probably in the 2 star category. I suppose the view made it worth it for us. We do not have any children and I was taken aback at how many families with young children (newborn to 5) stayed at the Caribe--lots of yelling and tantrums, but you find that at a mall too. The staff was nice when we interacted with them and the room was cleaned each day--we also left tips for the maid, so maybe our experience was unique. The bar staff at Oasis was nice too. Olas spa is a bit over-priced, but a nice respite from the beach. The location of the hotel to Old San Juan was convenient as well for walking or taking a cab. Caribe Hilton offered the tours we wanted and was close enough to the airport to provide an extra hour in the sun before we departed the island. It was my first visit to Puerto Rico and I was pleased to be in a US territory without the added stress of customs, etc for a change.

<Content>Mixed experience at Caribe Hilton A foursome (me and my better half, and another couple) went down for the weekend after Thanksgiving (11/25/05-11/28/05). We'd never been to Puerto Rico or any other tropical island, and were just looking for some quick time in the sun to recover from the drama that was Thanksgiving.We made reservations on-line and paid for our room at the time of booking. Both couples upgraded to the highest room -- king deluxe.We had a really mixed experience overall. Check-in took forever. And I mean 30-45 minutes. We even joined Hilton Honors so that we could get expedited service.When we finally arrived in our room, it was immediately clear that we had not been given a 'king deluxe' room -- the furnishings looked like they were from the 1970's, the view was of the gardens (and not the ocean, as promised), and the bathroom was completely unrenovated (i.e., no rain shower). It was in the tower on the 6th floor. There was also a strong mildew odor. When loud construction started on the floor above, we immediately went back down to check-in, waited another 15-20 minutes in line, and then had to argue with the clerk about the fact that we had not been given the room we paid for. Finally a manager came over, realized the mistake, tried to upgrade us, but found there were no more upgraded rooms with king size beds. By that point we were so annoyed (and kind of hot, considering that we were still wearing our cold weather clothes) that we agreed to take two double beds, as long as the room was upgraded. And then the manager told us that it wouldn't be ready for another 60-90 minutes. So, we checked our bags and met our friends for a drink at the bar near the pool.We finally made it to our room (which was indeed a deluxe, though with two full beds) and it was a huge improvement. It was definitely worth the money to upgrade. (Incidentally, our friends were checked right into a deluxe room. But they had no hot water for the first two days -- a valve had gotten turned off -- so it all evened out in the end.)The outdoor facilities at the Hilton -- pool, pool bar, restaurant -- are top notch. The beach is small, but private, which is a big deal. (Though there are nicer stretches of beach in Condado and Isla Grande they are very, very public.) The beach at the Hilton is basically a lagoon, which makes for very peaceful swimming.The bars (one inside, one outside) were both terrific. Pina Coladas were great. We ate at Morton's and at the restaurant where breakfast/brunch is served. Both were fine, but pricey. (Though coming from NYC the prices were not such a problem.)The pool was the best part of the resort. The hot tubs (basically small pools with very hot water) were open only on and off while we were there due to some maintenance issues. Things got much quieter on Sunday and Monday -- the number of kids plummeted.If we went back to San Juan, we might consider the Caribe, but ONLY in the new villas...

<Content>Horrible Room We stayed at the Caribe and would never stay there again. Terrible experience. Room was dirty, locks did not work, tub would flood, cracks in walls, poor customer sevice, etc. The only thing that was great about the Caribe Hilton is that I complanined so much that I got a full REFUND!!! If you have a bad expereince at any hotel in P.R. you must complain and demand a full refund and you should get it.Good hotels in Puerto Rico are VERY few and far between. You must do your research. Just because the hotel in P.R. uses the famous and familiar names of hotel chains in the United States mainland, do NOT think that those same hotel chains in P.R. are the same, THEY ARE NOT!!! What ever you think of a famous hotel chain in the U.S. you must automatically downgrade the quality in P.R. The hotels there are NEVER the same as in the U.S. Quality has a different meaning in P.R. than the U.S. mainland. Thanks.

<Content>Not worth the price Stayed here over Thanksgiving weekend to attend a friend's wedding. We had a deal with the wedding guests for $160 a night. I did not think this hotel was worth this price. Our rooms needed to be redone. There were some rust stains on the carpets and the bathrooms needed a little work. Our room's toilet didn't flush well and my friend's room didn't have hot water. My view was also terrible!!! They did not give us a courtesy room when we left even though it was requested. The beach was okay, but nothing to brag about. Overall I would recommend to stay somewhere else.

<Content>Wondreful staff We had a wondrful 4 day Thanksgiving stay at the Hilton. This is our second time and we loved it even more this time. It may be a little older hotel, but the staff is better then even the Ritz. The locals are so kind to American's, and as a world traveler, I will tell you that this now can be a huge concern. You can't go wrong with thsi one.

<Content>The rudest place I have ever stayed I am a Hilton Diamond Member and I have stayed at Hilton Hotels all over the world. I cannot believe how rude the hotel staff was at the Caribe Hilton. It started at check in and continued for my entire stay. The HH check in line was unbelievably long and the other staff who serviced the non-HH patrons simply stood and watched. When it was finally my turn to check in, both of the check in staff members simply walked away and left me standing there for another eleven minutes. I timed it because I was so shocked by their behavior. I did get a room with a view but they put me in the older portion of the hotel and my sliding glass door was so rusted it took great strength for me to open it. The robes were ragged and torn. I asked for another one and it took two phone calls and two days to receive another robe. The next extremely terrible experience was that someone kept calling my room and hanging up. One night a man came and banged on my door and demanded I open it. Of course, I did not open my door. (I am a woman business traveler and I give great care to my personal security). I called security and explained that someone is calling my room and some just banged on my door. They said if they try to come in your room give us a call. I asked if they could have someone come up and check the hallway. The security office told me, point blank, we don鈥檛 do that!Finally after bad service and a stalker of some kind, I called the HH concierge and complained. He decided to give me a free dinner at the buffet restaurant. (Which I didn't want) He made my reservation and when I arrived the hostess looked at me and didn't say a word. So, I said I have a reservation. She then said, Youuuuu have a reservation. I am not kidding. This hotel has terrible service. I could go on and on. I will NEVER stay here again.

<Content>We loved the Caribe Hilton! My husband and I visited Puerto Rico for the first time this weekend. After reading some of the negative reviews posted, I hesitated to book at the Caribe Hilton. I took the advice of several friends, however, who had stayed over the past few years and loved it. We had such a fabulous four day weekend! Let me start with the few negatives, just to be honest and get them out of the way:1. When we arrived, our room was not ready. We came back 45 minutes later, and our room still was not ready, but we were given a free drink coupon for the bar for both of us. When we arrived for the third time, our promised room was still not ready, but we were offered an upgrade to the executive floor. I balked at first, because I specifically asked for a room in the new tower when I made my reservation (thanks to the advice of many who posted previously), and the upgraded room was in the main building. The woman at the front desk assured me that if we were not satisified with the room that we could come back and we would be placed in the new tower. While we were a little disappointed with this entire experience, the hotel really made every attempt resolve it. To make a long story short, while our room was not as modern as the new tower, we had the best view of the ocean that we have ever had, the room was extremely clean and modern enough, and having use of the executive lounge was so worth any sacrifice of the amenities that we may have had in the tower rooms.2. We were only given an additional hour when we requested a later check out on our last day. We felt that this was a bit unfair considering how we had been so understanding at our arrival. It was also a Monday, and many guests had checked out the day before, so there really was no issue of the hotel being booked.Now that those two small negatives are out of the way, the rest of this review will focus on what a great experience we had:1. Again, as stated previously, the ocean front rooms have some of the best views I have ever seen, and much better in the main building than the tower.2. Very, very clean and excellent maid service.3. The previous reviews about the inside bar versus the pool bar were right on the money! Manuel, who was at the bar for most of the weekend, pours strong, generous drinks and has a great sense of humor. He took excellent care of us all weekend.4. Executive lounge is the way to go! Happy hour every night from 5-8, free drinks that include good wines and top shelf liquor (okay, so maybe we like to drink a bit!)and hours douvers. Breakfast every morning and dessert and cordials every night. Having a private concierge was a plus, too.5. The beach was very clean, but very average. My husband and I are really pool people anyway, and the Caribe has a fabulous pool.6. The location of the hotel was perfect. Far enough from the hub of San Juan so that you felt that you were in the midst of this wonderful tropical island, but close enough to Old San Juan to take a 25 minute walk. The cab ride was $10, and the bus was twenty-five cents and comes every 10 minutes.7. Service was excellent all around. Of course, tipping well is always greatly appreciated, and the people at the Caribe work very hard and appreciate the recognition.Finally, I want to say a few things about Puerto Rico itself. This was one of the best vacations I have taken to the Caribean. The restaurants in Old San Juan were wonderful. We at at Barrachina'a and Aguaviva and both were excellent. Aguaviva's was what I would describe as Latin Fusion, while Barrachina's was more traditional Latin. The shopping was also great- beautiful arts and crafts, a Coach Outlet (where I did some major damage), and a great mix of high end stores with funky, inexpensive places as well. Old San Juan was as beautiful a city as I have been to, and reminded me of some of the places that I visited in Europe. The people of Puerto Rico were friendly, and almost everyone spoke English. There were many New Yorkers, who chose to go back to PR for a more relaxing lifestyle, and we had fun talking to them about New York (since that is where we are from). We felt totally safe at all times and would not hestitate to go back.  I know this was long, but I hope that some of you who are planning to visit will find it as helpful as I found the reviews that I read posted before I took my trip! Have fun!

<Content>Great resort We had an excellent get away to the Caribe, the Home of the Pina Colada. My husband and I were looking for a quick get away. We chose Puerto Rico because we could use dividend miles for the flight and we chose the Caribe because we could use Hilton Points for the room. Once we arrived on the island we were wisked away in a pre-cost taxi, no surcharge and check right into our room from their open air lobby. We were upgraded to the newly renovated tower and had a great ocean view. This resort is located near Old San Juan which is in walking distance. The cost of the taxi ranged each time from $8-$12. It is best to pick you own price and stick with it. There were fine restaurants to choose from from plus for less then a mile walk you could go to casinos, mainland chain restaurants and local fair. We loved our room because of the plush bed linens, upgraded cooling system and awsome shower. There was no tub, there was a huge walk-in shower that could of held 5 people. There was an over head shower head to fall like rain or you could sit on the bench under a traditional shower. If you are going to the Caribe, ask for the renovated tower to get this luxury. They are still working on the older parts of the hotel. There was a convention, a wedding, and a graduation party all going on at this hotel at the same time but they still looked after all our cares. We highly recommend the off-resort activity of moonlight kayaking and swimming with the bio-luminesent plankton. There are no tropical fish on this side of the island as it the Atlantic ocean, to go snorkeling you have to be on the Caribbean side, keep that in mind!

<Content>Well Run Hotel I just returned from a stay at the Caribe Hilton for a Conference. This is the second time I stayed there and I found it even more comfortable. Had a room in the old building on the ninth floor. This is one of the executive floors and the room was very comfortable. Great bed, although the bottom sheet did not quite fit the length of the oversized pillow top mattress. Room was kept very clean and there was turn down service at night. Room was large with two easy chairs. Bathroom and bedroom both well lit so reading or working at night was easy. Small balcony. On the Executive floor there is a lounge for expanded continental breakfast and other small snacks and a separate concierge. This is very convenient when there is a conference as you can eat quickly.Staff is well trained and accommodating.i did not use the pool or beach this trip as I was busy with the conference but they are attractive and well kept.Restaurants in hotel are good although they are expensive but a short taxi ride takes you to Old San Juan or to Condado.Would stay at Hilton again.

<Content>Great weekend get-a-way It's not often that we get to take a vacation, so when we decided to leave our 9 month old twins to go away for the long weekend, we wanted somewhere warm and welcoming. We were delighted with the Caribe Hilton! The Caribe had extremely friendly staff who always smiled and said hello. We had a room in the old building on the ninth floor. The bed and temp was very comfortable. The room was very clean and well maintained. The lounge was fully staffed and fully stocked no matter when we indulged. There is no denying that meals are pricey everywhere you go on the island but that should be expected in such a touristy area. We wouldn't hesitate to bring the kids next time. The beach is child friendly because it's more of a lagoon, plus they have a wading pool. A vacation is what you make of it. Don't hesitate to make the Caribe Hilton part of your vacation.

<Content>Great time, great location We stayed at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan for a week in October of 2004 and had a wonderful time. I read the many mixed reviews about this hotel and others before making our reservation. There were positive and negative reviews for almost all the hotels we considered. Based on the negative reviews of some of the older rooms at the Hilton, I called the hotel directly and reserved a renovated room in the Tower. We were thrilled with the room....ocean and lagoon view, fabulous walk-in glass enclosed shower, king size bed). Our package included the daily breakfast buffet (fantastic), plus free access to their nice fitness center.We rented a car and thought the location was great (it's the closest resort style hotel to Old San Juan) and also has easy access to Condado. The Hilton has beautiful grounds, a wonderful resort type pool and private beach....but don't go to San Juan expecting fabulous Caribbean beaches...you would need to go to resorts in other parts of Puerto Rico for those beaches. The meals at the hotel were good but pricey. We had dinner twice at Aqua Viva, a seafood restaurant in Old San Juan, and loved it! We also found the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful.The original part of the Caribe Hilton was built around 1950 and has a nice history...one of the first major resorts in the Caribbean....and hosted stars like Frank Sinatra....they also invented the Pina Colada here. Although extensively renovated over the years...from some of the other reviews...it sounds like some of the older physical infrastruture is showing its age. Evidently Hilton originally leased the land under the hotel from Puerto Rico....and finalized an agreement a few years ago to actually purchase the land. They are building new condo's on the hotel grounds which will be part of the Hilton. Next to that....as you look toward downtown...will be an upscale urban mall/shopping area, a casino....and eventually a river walk along the lagoon leading downtown and to the new Convention Center.We loved our stay at the Hilton and would definitely go back. A friend of ours always stays at the Ritz Carlton (near the airport) which seems (by the reveiws) to be the nicest hotel in San Juan. However, we wanted to be closer in town.

<Content>Enjoyed our trip The joy to see all my parents and players happy and to thank me for this wonderful hotel was remarkable. Our team is from Los Angeles, CA. and we were in a baseball tournament in Puerto Rico. Our stay at the hotel was wonderful having 10 families I needed to have a nice place for them for 10 days. I highly recommend the Caribe. The rooms we had were beautiful we stayed at the Newer tower some people have posted pictures here and that helped me to know before we checked in. In some cases it may be an extra fee but well worth it, I offered the plan to the parents and some took it and others didnt but they were all pleased. The showers are beautiful and roomy. The rooms are clean and well worth it to get the ocean view. If you plan to vacation you should always either work overtime or save those bonuses so you can enjoy your trip we sure did. The pools are big and beautiful they also have a hammock area which I wasn't able to get too but geesh there are plenty of them to enjoy. Peacocks are beautiful and walk up to the pool area not bothering just looking. The secluded beach is great and take those water glasses so you can see and swim with the fish. The food is great in the restaurants and sure its pricey but well worth it. Drinks are also expensive but hey your on vacation what the heck! We rented cars and vans since we were playing baseball but the taxis were expensive so we either took the cars or walked or rode the bus once. It was worth renting the car but not too many parking places. Old San Juan was fun to shop and the prices are great for souvenirs. Across the street from the hotel is a Subway if you like sandwiches all the time which the kids did. Not far is a Sizzler but you would have to drive or take a taxiOur hotel stay at the Caribe was wonderful and I thank the TripAdvisor for letting others post reviews and pictures so we know what to expect. It helped me so much and I was not dissapointed with my stay at all and neither were the other families. The greatest joy was to see my 14 year old so excited about how our room was beautiful and the lobby had parrots and the pool was so much fun for him it was all worth it. My boys all hugged and thanked me for the wonderful time they had at the Caribe.The staff ALL THE STAFF was wonderful and so helpful.If you plan to visit the Caribe remember enjoy and be ready to spend its worth it! Will I visit again? Puerto Rico no because we will not play up there again but if I was to win a free stay at the Caribe I would be there in a instant.Thank you Hilton Caribe and GERARDO

<Content>No Problem Here Don't quite understand what all the fuss is about? The hotel was great. The staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was perfect. I read reviews before going and must say that I was nervous. The staff upgraded our room to the newely renovated tower with an ocean view since it was our honeymoon. The only down part about the stay was having to take taxi cabs everywhere. There wasn't a whole lot around the hotel but the other hotels and casinos were only a 5-10 minute walk.It gets me that people complain so much about the prices of food. The food is always overpriced at hotels. But not only were the hotel restaurants overpriced, it seemed that all the restaurants in the San Juan were a little pricey. The private beach was nice and the pool area was great. I read a review where the person was displeased about the beach. Not sure what he was expecting but it was to be on a private beach that accomidated the guests. I was told that this was the only private beach of all the hotels in the tourist area. Overall the trip was great and I would defintely stay at the Caribe Hilton again. Highly Recommended!

<Content>Depends what you're looking for! Went to PR for Labor Day weekend. We were celebrating my friend's upcoming nuptuals (aka Bachelorette Party!).ROOMS: They put us on the 8th floor in the Tower building. The room we stayed in wasn't very attractive. The room looked a little run down. The bathroom had a tub in the main area, with a shower stall and a toilet stall. Both stalls were cramped! FACILITIES: The pool  lobby areas were beautiful. The hotel restaurants all range $20+. The poolside grill has munchies for $5+. The beach is NOT a beach. It's a lagoon.CONDADO: There's a casino across a bridge (fairly long walk; $7 by cab) about 10 minutes away. It's not packed - which I prefer!! Definitely eat at ROPA VIEJA! Great PR food!OLD SAN JUAN: Is about 15 minutes away ($12 by cab). It's quaint.SAN JUAN: Is about 10 minutes away ($10 by cab). There's a casino at the El San Juan which gets packed! There's also a club called Babylon/Brava which plays a GREAT mix of music! House, Club, Hip-Hop, Rap, Reggae, Reggaeton - everything!!Condado is a retreat from the busy streets of San Juan. If you're looking for a nice peaceful, relaxing vacation - Condado is great. If you're looking to pick up young people and hang out all night - stay in San Juan!!

<Content>Disappointment abounds I stayed at El Caribe Hilton from 8-16-05 to 8-21-05, as a member of a convention. I agree with another post here that said the pool area is very nice. It really is. That is the only outstanding thing about this hotel.This was my first trip ever to Puerto Rico and I was really looking forward to getting out and experiencing the culture of the island. Not possible at this hotel. There is nearly nothing within walking distance except a Subway sandwich shop. The sky-high prices of the food in the hotel ($18.95 for breakfast buffett), made the fact that there was nothing else around even worse. A taxi to Old San Juan runs about $15 from the hotel. You can catch the bus though, for a quarter.The beach was a joke, in my opinion. Any beach in Florida would have been better. It's nothing more than a small lagoon, separated from the sea with a wall of stones. And they rent snorkeling equipment! For what?? The lobby is nice - I loved how it was open, from the main desk all the way through the bar and out to the pool  sea. Speaking of the bar...can you say outrageous? $8 for a drink (every drink) and $6.75 for an imported beer. My room was run down, but clean. The balconies are a weird wedge-shape and since I was on the 4th floor, I had a lovely view of the rooftop of the 2nd floor lobby below me. The drone from the rooftop air conditioners drowned out any hope I'd had of listening to the sea. And air conditioning! My room was like a freezer the entire week. I slept with my head under the covers, shivering, for the first couple of nights. I kept turning the air down, down, down, but the room would not warm up. I finally had to turn the thermostat to off to get comfortable. I had the air set as low as 80潞 and it still would not stop running. Of course, within an hour of shutting off the AC all together, every mirror and window in the room immediately fogged up. The reservation process was a nightmare. I had to call 4 separate times to get my reservation right, and when I got there, it STILL was wrong. There were four of us in my group who travelled together, and it took the desk clerk an HOUR to get all 4 of us checked in. He assured me that my reservation really was for 5 nights instead of 1 (that was the problem I had called 4 times about to try to fix) but the morning after my first night, I had the express checkout papers slid under my door.There is a mandatory $4 bellman charge added to every reservation, as well as a .50/day maid charge. They tried to tack on an additional dollar a day for an in kind donation to Puerto Rican KIDS (some charitable thing), but we were able to get those charges taken off. Not that I wouldn't have donated a dollar day to a kids' organization, but I really did not like it being added automatically to my bill. I was lying in the bathtub one morning (at about 8:00) and all of the sudden this horrible racket started. I wasn't sure if it was from the room next to me, or the room above me, but they were obviously working on the plumbing somewhere. They were banging and clanging, and then I'd hear plaster falling down the wall. It scared the you-know-what out of me. It sounded as though they were going to come right through my wall. This happened 2-3 more times during the week. They were painting the hallways, and the exterior walls. The hot tub was closed due to renovation. The convention facilities were outstanding. If you're looking for somewhere to hold a convention, this place might work for you.Ok, so this hotel might be good if you're taking your kids. The walled-off beach would be great for little ones, and since there are little to no waves, you could let them play worry-free. And like I said, the pool is really awesome. But for an adult vacation, look elsewhere. I know I will. I would love to go back to Puerto Rico someday, and I most definitely will NOT stay at El Caribe Hilton.

<Content>Great fun. This was a lovely hotel with large swimming pools and a beach area, lots of restaurants and a good view from the rooms. Exotic garden surrounds the hotel and lobby area has a beautiful caribbean feel. Just down the road from bus stops and local shops. Taxis easily available in the hotel. Activities available every day including spanish lessons and salsa lessons. Two places to visit- Plaza las Americas (largest shopping mall in the whole of the caribbean) and Old San Juan (lots of souvenir shops and sites).

<Content>Good location close to San Juan The beach and pool are very nice and the room, as long as you get one above the 14th floor, is OK. The rooms do need some remodeling and the folks in the lobby agreed that they were plans in the works to remodel the rooms in the tower where I stayed. I liked that it was really close to San Juan with only an 8 dollar taxi ride each way to anywhere in San Juan or Condado. There is not much going on in the lobby in the evening for entertainment so going elsewhere is usually the plan.

<Content>Hope this isn't a typical Hilton This was my first stay at a Hilton and my third trip to San Juan. Lets start with the good. The pool area was very nice. The beach was nice. The whole lobby being very open to the elements vs an enclosed lobby...had a carribean feel to it. My first room was a handicapped accessible room in the garden wing. I knew I was in trouble when they appologized for putting my in the room and said I could switch out the next day. They were booked. Carpet in the room had stains all over it. The garden area was blocked off with tape. They were doing construction.Next day they put me in one of the towers. I did get a balcony...with paint chipping away. The walls were scuffed up. The mini bar kept making noises. I called and asked them to fix it. The next day the problem occurred again. I gave up on them fixing it so I unplugged the mini bar instead. I was ignored at the bar in the lobby. Overall, I was very disappointed. This was my first and last stay at the Hilton Caribe.

<Content>Hilton Family should tend to their Hotels!! The place was horrible. The furnishings were worn - the lobby had a horrible odor of a septic tank. The rooms were small and old. The bathrooms were in much need of repair. There was a Q-tip on the floor in our hallway for our entire stay. We tried four rooms one worse than the next - stayed two nights and moved over to a competitor for the rest of our vacation. The beach was not groomed lots of garbage - cigarette butts. The pool had mold on the stairs and floating garbage - cups, etc. The staff, however, were very friendly but seemed oblivious or used to the surroundings.This will definitely affect what hotel I will stay in the next time I travel and Hilton will not be first on my list.

<Content>Great place for before a cruise My boyfriend and I (both 26) stayed at this hotel for one night on July 31 before a cruise. When we booked the hotel in April we were worried because of reviews we saw here but we opted to stay here anyway and we were very happy we did. We arrived around 5pm and our room was not ready yet but we were able to check our bags and explore the grounds a bit and were given free drink coupons so we were not too bothered by our delay getting into our room. When the room was ready I was pleasently surprised that our particular room looked exactly like the pictures on the website and I honestly could not find one thing to complain about. The room and bathroom were clean, the AC worked great, the bed was very comfy, and we experienced no bad odors at all. We went to Old San Juan for dinner which was great but I cannot really comment on the quality/price of food at the hotel itself (I would highly recommend Buru though for great tapas in old san juan) The grounds were perfect. We quite enjoyed laying on a hammock on the beach late at night listening to the ocean while drinking mojitos! On Saturday we got up early and grabed coffee and a bite to eat at Starbucks which was in the lobby and then spent the morning on the beach which again was clean and perfect for getting some sun and having fun in the ocean. There are a few convienience type stores around the hotel as well as a Subway about a 3 minute walk away (a safe walk as well) Overall we were very impressed with this hotel and would have no problem recommending it to others to stay at before/after a cruise. However, I probably would not recommed it to business travelers who may not be taking in the outdoor ammenites that this hotel has to offer. The hotel did not really seem to have it's act together in terms of check-in but it didn't really bother us too much as we were on vacation and were not about to let a delay in getting to our room get us down. Also, families may want to beware because of the lack of affordable food near by.

<Content>lovely grounds I booked an executive floor room (the most expensive room type available) and was promised an ocean-front view. I was on the 7th (out of 10) floor and did have an ocean view, but it definitely wasn't ocean front. I was towards the back of the tower (away from the ocean). I expected the best and was slightly disappointed as far as my view was concerned.The room itself was in excellent condition. The furnishings were brand new and the bathroom was done in marble. There were a few minor maintenance issues with some of the wood trim looking like it had water damage. One thing I did not like was that the hotel automatically added on a $1 per day charge to your account for a donation to a children's charity. Not that I mind donating to a good cause, but I don't like the principle of it. I felt like it was forced upon me and in my rush to check out I didn't want to take the time to get the charges removed.Another similar issue occurred when I ordered room service. On the room service menu it stated that there was a $2.75 delivery fee and that the suggested gratuity was 15%. It clearly said suggested and never mentioned that the 15% would be automatically added on. When the food was delivered I signed the receipt and handed the delivery person a $10 cash tip (which was 20%) of the total bill. When I later examined the bill I noticed that they had already added a 15% gratuity to the bill. I was upset. I called room service and told them I felt they needed to convey that a 15% gratuity would be automatically added. I told them that the service was excellent, but not worth 35%. They offered to deliver breakfast to the room the next morning for free, but I declined as I wasn't looking for a freebie.The grounds, restaurants and pools were all top notch. There was an excellent swimming beach right outside the pool with umbrellas and beach chairs, and the grounds were beautiful. Everyone I spoke with was extremely friendly.A quick word of advice for fellow travelers.... Make sure you have a room in the tower (not one of the garden wings) and pay attention to the small print...there is some misinformation about certain charges!

<Content>Nothing here folks, move on ALMOST NOT RECOMMENDED. Stayed July 28th  29th, clearly they have a sewer problem as the trucks (2 huge tanker trucks) came this evening again and the foul smell was evident. I'm on the verge of giving up on Hilton (just reviewed the Prague one 2 weeks ago - obviously I get around). At checkin room not available until 3:15, staff friendly (no big deal). This is a destination hotel and attracts US, South American and European tourists generally with family or friends. Room was adequate size and walls thick to mask sound. Furnishings in good condition but the general state of repair (particularly the bathroom) was fair. Hotels close to the ocean ALL struggle to keep humidity at bay, hence air conditioning runs freezer like to keep wetness in check. I noted the staff always cleaning, but the hotel appear dirty, I attribute this to the heavy guest load this property sees. Several restaurants all fairly pricey (I note that all food in the Island chain is often horribly overpriced). The hotel has a nice walking areas. The beach while not huge, is certainly a plus. Pool area has some features, but it's not a water park or place you'll swim laps. The hotel is situated a fair walk (about 15 minutes to the tourist area), however, the area is generally safe (according to my local associates) and well patroled by police. I stayed in the Tower portion which several have attributed as being the best location. All-in-all, it's simply OK

<Content>A Big Disappointment Our vacation began on June 28th thru July3, 2005 with my husband and 3 teenage daughters. I would have to say that I am not one to complain and I did however check all the reviews written before we set out on our vacation. I ignored the less favorable reviews knowing that there are some people out there that you will never be able to please. I SHOULD HAVE PAID ATTENTION! The hotel was not at all what you see in the pictures on the internet. This hotel was very run down and neglected. Let me say that there was a foul odor the whole time we were there. It did not take us long to figure out that there was 2 sewer waste disposal trucks outside of our tower that emptied out our waste from the hotel. They were there 24 hrs and the whole time we were there. If you would walk on that side of the hotel (garden tower) there was literaly feces on the ground where it had accidently fallen out of the hoses of the trucks. When it would rain there were buckets cathing the water from the ceilings in the lobbies. The first morning we were there the bellman was running after a mouse that was in the lobby and because he could not catch him with the bucket he was using, the bellmen decided to pound him to death in front of everyone with this bucket. There was a problem with the pool. The hotel was not a place for a family. The resturants were to expensive there and because of the hotel's location there were no places you could walk to and eat. The hallways were never vacummed the whole time we were there. Everytime we would walk out of the elevator on our floor the ashtray that had fallen over with trash remained on the floor for several days before anyone did anything about it. Someone left their food on a tray outside of their hotel room and it stayed there until the next day. We had (2) rooms. They were very neglected. The a/c did not work at all in one and then the other it was too cold and stayed that way. It was soo cold that there was condensation the whole time on the windows. The other room it was clammy and hot. Some of the electrical outlets did not work and the one in the bathroom was very loose. The one time I did try to use the hair dryer it blew a fuse and shut down the air conditioning system, TV. We would lose electricals off/on our floor/room the whole time we were there. The beach was a lot smaller than it appeared in the pictures. What you don't see in the photos is all the construction going on around the streets as well as in the hotel. I could go on, and on however I cannot believe a hotel that has suffered so much neglect could still be in business. The hotel's walls were filthy. To think that this was a Hilton. I wonder when was the last time anyone from the Hilton Corporation has inspected this hotel. I can understand how it would have been a beautiful hotel in it's day but not anymore.

<Content>Loved the Caribe Hilton, will return My husband and 6  10 yr old sons arrived at the Caribe Hilton, had a quick and smooth check-in and went straight to the Atlantico Bar and Grill - very friendly and attentive staff, I left great tips everytime. Pool had a swim up bar w/jacuzzi, and music. Las Palmeras restaurant had great buffet breakfast (free w/my package), lunch and dinner (39.99 for seafood buffet and 50% off kids meals). The beach water was clear and calm, the staff was very accomodating. Nightime we spent walking on the beach, feeding the tropical fish at the dock, laying in the pool or hammock under the moonlight. The location of the hotel was perfect for sightseeing in Old San Juan, only 5 mins away by car. Obtaining directions to different cities was easy, with the Concierge desk's help, we traveled to Ponce (to visit family), Luquillo (El Yunque rainforest) and Fajardo (beach). We will definitely return to El Caribe next year, but this time, with my entire family.

<Content>Great Location, Fabulous Pool Area Unlike some folks, I found the location to be great. Quite a few good restaurants were only a very short walk away as well conveniences like a drug store. We had an ocean-front room that admittedly was a bit musky, but so are most ocean-front hotels with carpet. Nevermind the room, we stayed at the pool and (small) beach. There were some tucked-away little private areas by the waterfront, and the pool was fabulous. There was even a waterslide that some of us big kids enjoyed, not to mention a swim-up bar. During our stay there was some noisy renovations ongoing which are certainly completed by now.

<Content>Loved the Caribe Hilton I am a few months late writing as I stayed at the Caribe Hilton the first week of February 2005. My sister accompanied me on a business trip, I usually stay at the Embassy Suites in Isla Verde when I travel to the island alone but I wanted her to get a feel of the area including the beach. I had not stayed at the Caribe Hilton for 10 years and they have made some nice improvements to the building and grounds. The open air lobby area leading the bar and beach is beautiful. The staff is friendly and will do their best to help you with whatever it is you need. The bar is overpriced but treat yourself to a drink at least once and enjoy the view and music. The hotel restaurants are very expensive. However, you can take public transportation or walk to Old San Juan where there are lots of places to eat at a more reasonable price. If you go into Old San Juan, try La Bombonera Restaurant at 259 San Francisco Street, it's an old luncheonette. Sit at the counter and order fresh squeezed orange juice and expresso. The prices are very reasonable and you can try some local food. The Condado bridge was being worked on when I was there but when it is open, it's a quick walk from the Hilton and is pedestrian friendly. There are many good restaurants on the Condado and on the streets behind it. Explore during the day.Back to the hotel, if you pay an additional small fee to upgrade to the Executive level, you get a continental breakfast until 10:30 am along with snacks and drinks at 5:30 pm and cordials and dessert from 8 to 10pm. It's located on the 9th floor in the old section of the hotel. My room in the old section was comfortable and had been uggraded recently with new good quality mattresses, comforters and curtains. The only complaint was the air vent in the bathroom needed cleaning. The housekeeping staff was good. It helps to tip the maids. When I stay again, I will request a room in the tower as they are a little nicer. The work out area is clean and there is a small cafe next to it with a selection of healthy lunches and juice drinks more reasonably priced than the other places to eat at the hotel. The hotel beach area offers lounge chairs and hammocks and the pool is nice with a great view of the ocean.Hotel parking is $20 per day. If you are staying for a few days,rent a car as it is very easy to drive around and there is so much to see on this beautiful island.

<Content>Good hotel, bad location Just got back from 5 days at the Caribe Hilton. First the good news -- 7 great restaurants, nice lobby and pools, a small beach behind a breakwall, so no waves and little kids can play in the ocean, very comfortable and clean standard rooms. The biggest problem with the Caribe Hilton is location. Getting around in San Juan is a huge headache and costly. The Hilton is neither in Old San Juan nor in Condado. It's in the middle, and there's nothing there but the Hilton and the Normandie hotel. It's a 30 minute walk (hot sun) to Condado and 45 minutes to Old San Juan. Tried to rent a bike ($7 an hour and a hassle). Tried to rent a scooter for all 5 days, but only option was $60 a day for 9 am to 6 pm (yes must be returned every evening!). Renting a Harley was $150 a day (but at least you could keep it for the whole stay)! Taxis won't use meters and gouge tourists $10-$20 no matter how close you go (that's $20-$40 if you return). Buses (fare: 25 cents)? Both times I tried the bus: stood at bus stops minimum of 45 minutes (including in front of Hilton). Forget it. So conceirge desk pushed renting a car ($30 a day -- bring your proof of insurance from home or you'll have to add $10 a day). Hilton adds $15 a night to park your car. But why get a car? There's not really anyplace to park in Condado and Old San Juan anyway, so having a car is a hassle not a help unless you're going outside San Juan entirely. And the traffic jams up incredibly in Old San Juan and Condado. So here's what I did: took a taxi to Walmart ($20), bought a simple, fully assembled bicycle and lock ($60), and used it for 5 days (total cost $16/day including taxi to Walmart). Then I gave it away to a stunned kid on my last day (with a note to his mom assuring her it was not stolen). Biking to Condado took 8 minutes; to Old San Juan 12 minutes. Nothing worse than getting to a place and not being able to get around at a reasonable cost. Next time I'll stay in Condado (though Hilton itself was nice -- just horrible location).

<Content>Very nice Hotel - Definitely will return Having read many of the reviews about the Caribe Hilton, I was a bit concerned; I wasn't sure what to expect. What I found when I got there was very refresing and definitely worth the money.First, the pros and cons:Pros:1. Very reasonable rate ($150 per night, business class, June)2. Fantastic beach 3. Wonderfully refresing and relaxing pool4. 4-star quality room (with a couple very minor caveats)5. Very helpful and friendly staff6. Wonderful overall setting and experienceCons:1. Restaurants were quite expensive (figure $50 per meal for a nice dinner)2. Distance from business districts required $20 (each way) cab rides3. Few close restaurants 4. $15 per day charge for internet access (standard Hilton complaint - give me a break; I've spent $350 per night at some Doubletrees, and still had them charge me extra for internet access)The room I had was a standard business-class hotel room: kingsize bed, a balcony with amazing view of the ocean, and a decent sized TV. I stayed in the 'old' tower (i.e. the original building). The room was clean, the bed ws confortable. There was a small standard safe located in the closet. There were a couple very small issues; the bathroom vent screen had quite a it of dust in it; looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while, and there was a mtal panel in the main room that displayed corrosion from the sea air. Nothing serious or nasty tho (altho I would clean that grille, it was quite noticeable). Also, I had to have security lt me in my room twice; the key had a problem with the electronic lock. Overall, the room is comparable to other 4-star hotel rooms I have stayed in, especially given its age, and the effects of the humidity and sea air.I felt quite safe the entire trip. Security was noticeable, there were cameras that were obvious, and I felt quite secure roaming the grounds day or night. The restaurants are quite expensive. However there is a wonderful local sandwich shop on the avenue leading to the hotel, literally less than a 2 minute walk from the lobby. Great (and quite inexpensive) sandwiches, especially Cubanos...however they close at 3 PM, so it is a better option for breakfast and luch. Also there is a Subway sandwich shop near there as well, which is open for dinner. Adequate, if uninspiring.The beach is spectacular. It is more a 'lagoon' than a front to the actual ocean. There is a breakwate aout 50 meters from the beach, which allows water (and fish) into the area; the water is clean, as is the beach area. very comfortable water. Actually decent for light snorkling, given the fact that it's mostly sandy.The pool was clean, and very refreshing. Multiple levels, large, and with a children's pool. Plenty of play areas for the kids.The staff was helpful and friendly; I didn't feel like they had their hands out all the time (as another reviewer felt). Most spoke reasonable English (much better than my pathetic Spanish), and did what it tok to help me get my needs met. Overall, I will certainly stay there again when I return to San Juan. It was quite the pleasurable experience, andf I had no issues that even approached 'moderate' in severity. I can highly recommend the Caribe Hilton for both business and pleasure.

<Content>I liked it!! My husband and I stayed for 2 nights, I thought the room was very nice clean and a great view of the ocean. The people are very friendly and they all speak english which was great for my husband who doesnt speak spanish. They have the best pina colada and the food was good, just dont eat outside of the restaurant unless you like the birds and lizards eating with you or next to you. They have a nice pool with a bar and their own little private beach. I would stay here again, but I think there a little over priced. If you have a car rental be prepared to pay about $15.00 a day and good luck finding a parking spot. Overall I thought it was nice, just nice!

<Content>Great Stay It wasn't till after I had already booked my stay at the Hilton that I found this web site and read a few reviews on this hotel. I was thinking that my stay there was going to be a nightmare. Well, it was anything but! I had a wonderfull time at the Hilton. I purchased their bounceback package, which included buffet bkfst, ocean front view, executive lounge access and use of the health club. The cushened lounge chairs  umbrellas on the private beach were also available at no extra charge. The use of the executive lounge was a highlite of our stay. At 5:30 to 8:00pm in the lounge, cocktails, wine, beer and finger food was served and 8:30 to 10:00pm they served cordials. The executive lounge crew were nothing but professional. All in all, it was the best 5 days I spent in a hotel in a long time. Dates stayed were 5/16 to 5/21/05

<Content>Caribe Nightmare First the check in took over an hour despite myself being a Hilton Gold Honros member.Second the room was dirty and had soiled underwear in the drawers.There was a heavy MOLD growth in the room and ventilation system which was very overpowering and which made me and my family ill.Third - upon check out I had a hard time to get a bell man and was forced to carry my own luggage - when I tried to use a push cart to carry my luggage the rest of the way a bell man became confrontational with me and tried to physcially pull the push cart from my hands,Mortons was a disaster Overall - worst I have experirnced and I stay in Hilton properties on a weekly basis Finally they did not process the paperwork so I can have my HHonors rewards points

<Content>Relaxing Stay at the Caribe Hilton My daughter and I just returned from a three day stay at the Caribe. The hotel and grounds are beautiful. The grounds are very well maintained. There is a lot of tropical foliage and great scenery. There is an outdoor bar/grill called the Atlantico, that overlooks the ocean, and serves light food such as hamburgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, drinks,etc. There is continuous recorded salsa music playing, adding to the atmosphere..We were entertained by a beautiful, wild, rather tame blue peacock during lunch. He strutted around hoping to find food from the guests. This was quite a novelty.Included in our package was a free breakfast buffet in the Palmeras restaurant. The food and variety were excellent.Our ocean-front room was neat and clean. However, I would consider that the room was somewhat average.We had a magnificent dinner at Morton's Steakhouse, which is part of the Caribe Hilton. The dinner was very pricey but excellent.Directly off the hotel grounds, there is a great deal of construction going on in the area. We took taxis to Old San Juan and Plaza de Americas (the biggest mall in the caribbean). It is well worth a visit. There is also a casino not too far way.We found it all very relaxing. We had just missed several days of constant rain. So we were very fortunate.There is a concierge that answers all your questions regarding food, shopping, tours, etc. They were very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Caribe is great for relaxation A friend and I just returned from a 7 day stay at the Hilton Caribe. We are two single girls who just completed our master's degrees and wanted a week of complete relaxation. We were very impressed with the hotel. Our room (in the new tower) overlooked the harbor and was clean and comfortable. We had great service and enjoyed all aspects of the hotel.Compared to other hotels in San Juan, this is a great option. It is afordable, conveniently located to many great areas, and beautiful. There are several restaurants in the hotel--we enjoyed the swim-up pool bar, the Italian restaurant, and Palmerra's for brunch and breakfast. Room service was also great. They delivered each order with complimentary warm cookies. Skip Morton's. We've been to other Morton's and this was awful. Way overpriced and children everywhere. It was comparable to Chucky Cheese. Terrible.The beach was great. Small, but fine. The water is so warm and clear--fish everywhere. There were definitely enough chairs and the chairs all included padding. Be careful with rafts--you can rent them by the day, but they are about $15 each! It rained for four of the seven days we visited San Juan. There is a great tanning salon around the corner, as well as a liquor store and 7-11 type place which are very convenient and more afordable than the hotel facilities. In case of rain, bring an umbrella and tour Old San Juan and the rain forest. Also, while you are there, visit other hotel properties. We went to the Wyndam and the Marriot and were amazed by how much more we enjoyed the Hilton Caribe. If you do anything in San Juan, definitely have dinner at Tangerine at the Water Club. It is AMAZING!!! So cute and so delicious. Isla Verde is a cute area as well.Old San Juan is cute, but very kitschy. Also, we were amazed by how many homeless people were there. We did not feel very safe, especially after dark. Much better to tour during the day and then stay in the resort for the evening.It was fun to visit the cruise ship docks. Bring cards, games, and books to entertain yourselves in case it rains. Puerto Rico is very commercial and San Juan is expensive and Americanized. If you are looking for a pure beach vacation, look elsewhere. If you are searching for a fun vacation with 'American' food and lots of activities, where you can use American dollars and speak English, as long as you don't care about rain, San Juan is great. We spent lots of time at the beach, read lots of books, and watched lots of pay-per-view movies. We loved the pina coladas and the swim-up bar. I returned with a great tan and am very relaxed. Just wish the weather would have been better.

<Content>Satisfied I went with a couple of family members May 12th through May 16th. The hotel is beautiful. The room was average: small imperfections that could be looked over. We were surprised to find that housekeeping does not come to clean your room until well in the afternoon. We finally figured out that it is probably due to hotel guests desire to sleep in and enjoy their holiday without interruptions. The day we were to check out, housekeeping was knocking on the door around 830am. In addition, this may be the reason why guests have to wait on their rooms to be ready when you check in. I didn't mind, it gives you the opportunity to explore the hotel. Make sure that you request face towels, because they were rarely provided without requesting them. They provided hand towels and bath towels though. Make sure you place all of your towels on the floor each morning, otherwise they may not provide new ones. Recommend you go to a local grocer or store in San Juan, because (of course) the hotel charges outrageous prices for water and soda. My cousin bought a 6 pack of soda (which werent full 12 ounce cans) for $6!!!!! I bought a large bottle of water for $3!!! Food is also on the high side, so dont be afraid to ask the concierge for a local eatery. They suggested La Bombonera in Old San Juan for breakfast. My breakfast was less than $6. A Subway and Sizzler is within walking distance to hotel. Pools are okay for just wading considering the fact that not one of them is over 4 ft deep. However, the swim up pool bar was my favorite spot and we stayed there until they shut down everyday of our vacation. By the way, the pool bar closes WAY too early (6pm). There is also the private beach which I loved and an area with about 4 or 5 hammocks. GREAT place to relax and enjoy the wonderful ocean breeze. Anywhere you order a drink expect it to be a REAL drink. They dont believe in watering your drinks down nor are they cheap. Expect to pay about no less than $7 for a drink. The taxi drivers were all very helpful, however, they drive like madmen. Taxi prices vary: Old San Juan was $8-$10, Plaza las Americas was $12-$16, Wyndham El San Juan (Babylon-club) was $16-$18. Overall, it was a good hotel stay.

<Content>Relaxing stay at the Caribe Hilton The Caribe Hilton has a wonderful private beach that is very relaxing and beautiful. The public beaches in San Juan are very crowded so this was a nice option to have. The pools and grounds are very well kept. The room is just average. We had the buffet breakfast every morning which was excellent! The only con was that the spa/jacuzzi was not part of your fee at the hotel and you have to pay extra for it. All in All, it is a nice place to relax, enjoy privacy, and it is family friendly.

<Content>Never Again This hotel is beautiful on the outside but terrible in the inside as far as my room is concern. First, I couldn't find my room, I had a garden view you would think wow, it was a garden view under construction, the bathroom had a shower with a drain that I was afraid to use in case of a flooding in the entire room, carpet was stained, the room service food was cold and they automatic charge (not a option) you money for the children services plus room service fee. I had problems with the phone not working, all three phones, i had to yell so the person could hear me, I let the hotel know they still charged me - I requested an upgrade and they said they had no vacancies and i said i saw a several people checking out , no no vacancies. This hotel is more for business meetings and conference there was nothing there to do when the weather was not good. The only time i enjoyed there was a woman who worked in a clothing store, she was wonderful and friendly and kind to me, other than that it was the worst time i ever had and i suggest to pick another place to stay. Never Again. Lucy in Manhattan, New York City

<Content>Expected More Being a Hilton Hotel, I expected much more for the cost of the room. But it was close to the bus lines, although you had to dodge traffic to get there. The hotel Normandie was literally right next door and next time I go to PR I'm going to try to stay there. From the outside it was nice and I think the rooms were cheaper. The first couple nights the room was fairly nice, then I checked out to go to Vieques and when I came back they must have put me in the old part of the hotel because the quality of the rooms were remarkably different for the same cost.

<Content>Disappointed I stayed 2 nights at the Caribe in March. My room wasn't ready  the hotel clerk tried talking me into a different type of room. I said no; she had an attitude. The room I had was on a low floor, overlooking a roof; and I couldn't use the balcony because of hot air vents  fumes. I did have a side view of the ocean that was nice. Ate dinner at the Morton's steak restaurant, which was lousy  expensive; including the service. The pool areas were nice  service satisfactory. The location is not a walkable one. My overall impression was of a tired property with high prices.

<Content>Very nice w/a few exceptions Recently returned from a vacation in Puerto Rico and it was lovely. We split our time between the Caribe Hilton and Rincon Beach Resort on the West Coast. My wife and I went with a single mom and her three children, 14, 10, and 8 (they never complained about being bored). I had read many of the reviews of the Caribe and like others, I was somewhat nervous. In the end I relied on a friend's review of her 2004 stay.Upon arriving, I was awed by the view from the open air lobby, whereas you could see the pools, and ocean. Like many others who commented, our rooms would not be ready until after 3:00 P.M. It wasn't that big of a problem because we were able to change and head to the pool/beach area. This area was very beautiful and busy (we were there over Easter weekend). Even though it was packed, we were able to find some free chairs and enjoy the pool and the surroundings. Staff was able to accomdate our request of having rooms close to each other. We were actually next door, rooms 752  753. The view was excellent. We could see the garden and the ocean. Even though we were on the 7th floor, you could hear the ocean water, always very relaxing. Rooms themselves were very nice and large. There were some signgs of wear but overall I was impressed. Water pressure was good, the only problem was the cold water never got cold, so we couldn't get any cold water for drinking.Hotel and area seemed very safe. If you are looking for the safety of an all-inclusive that caters to only Americans and European's this may not be for you. There were a lot of locals at the hotel and in the surrounding area, which my wife and I loved. I personally don't like the captive feel of an all-inclusive hotel. We went running several days into the Old San Juan area. It is very beautiful and old world. Regardless if you stay at the Caribe, if you are in the area you must go to Old San Juan and visit one of the forts and go to some of shops. Regarding food, we didn't eat at the restraunts at the hotel because there were so many others around the area. The family that we were with ate there a couple of times and said the food they had was pretty good. The three that stand out are the La Dorado and Ikako(?), and El Hamburger for the best burger in Puerto Rico. Get there early because they get packed minutes after they open the door.Downsides:Except the concierges, the staff was somewhat nonchalont about answering questions and tending to issues. The family we went with had a leak that was not really taken care of in a timely manner. I do agree with others who have said that they could use some work in this area, especially for the price of the rooms. There were a couple of times when there was a sewer type smell in the lobby. Not sure what that was about but we didn't spend much time there so it didn't really bother us. Location could be a bother for some people. Cab rides are $10 for either Old San Juan or Conado, where all the action is. My wife and I walked several times and you're looking at about 35 minutes to either which wasn't a problem for us. It is dark in both directions at night but it seemed pretty safe and I didn't hear about any issues while we were there.Overall a great experience and would defintely return to Puerto Rico and stay at the Caribe again.

<Content>Room Broken Into I stayed at the Hilton Caribe in Puerto Rico from March 25 - March 27, 2005. I had a very disturbing experience, and I question the safety of the guests at this hotel, and thought you should know.On Saturday, March 26 at 6:45pm, someone walked into my room, having used a key. I was changing, and I was faced away from the door. As soon as I said Hello - who's there (I did not turn around immediately as I was finishing getting dressed), the person walked out of the room. I then walked into the hallway, no one was there. When I turned the corner, a bellman was there. I asked him if he had walked into my room mistakenly, he said no.I immediately went to the front desk, and alerted them of the situation. Ricardo, the desk manager on duty did not believe me. I requested the general manager, who then came over. Genero (the general manager), assured me that he would have security at my door immediately, to download the information from the lock as to what keys had been used in my lock. I then went to dinner. When I went back to my room, an hour and a half later, no one had been there. Security finally came at 10pm - 3 hours after I had talked to the manager. The manager left a voice mail at 10:30 saying the only other keys used in the lock besides keys issued to the room were housekeeping, and that I should be safe. Housekeeping was not on my floor when the break in occurred, there was no knock prior to the person entering my room, thus I do not believe it was housekeeping. I truly believe someone - not housekeeping - got a hold of a key to my room, and used it, and only turned away when they found someone in the room. Thus, I question the safety of the guests in the hotel.I also think the manner in which management responded to my complaint was extremely poor. To wait 3 hours to get security to my room is abominable. To assume that it must have been housekeeping and consider the case closed is extremely lax security. I stay at hotels approximately 200 nights a year, and have done so for many years. I have only recently started staying at Hilton brand hotels, and if this is the kind of security that Hilton offers, I do not think I - or anyone - should go back.

<Content>Not up to Hilton Strandards! My Husband and I stayed at the Caribe Hilton (March 5) one night before departing for a cruise. The Hotel lobby and pool are very nice and have recently been remodeled. The lagoon and beach are also beautiful. The fitness center was okay. The equipment was in need of replacement, although the view of the ocean made it pleasant to exercise. I would not stay here again. The rooms are very old, with the exception of the rooms in the tower. The service at the desk was not what we expected. Our flight got in late and we were very tired, needless to say at 6pm our room was still not available. They said that there was nothing that could be done b/c the previous guests had checked out late. They would not let us have another room. I felt that $400 a night was too expensive for this hotel. Anybody wishing to stay here should request a room in the tower, otherwise you may be disappointed.

<Content>March 05 at the Caribe Hilton The grounds of this hotel are amazing. The pool is beautiful and very clean ( a little cold but refreshing!). There seemed to be ample chair space by the pool and beach (which is like a lagoon/lake but with ocean water... great for kids). Our room was amazing on the 19th floor of the New Tower We had a great view of the lagoon and the fort in Old San Juan in the distance. We faced west and had great sunset views. Our room had a big bed, was clean and the bathroom was amazing. A big shower for two! I think from reviews I have read and from trip advisor reviews posted, if you stay here, ask for a room in the new tower, its worth it!My only complaint about this place was the service. The service from the hotel staff was pretty slow. We ate at Palmeras for breakfast and lunch once each and the service was very slow. BUT at lunch the waiter realized our frustration and comped us dessert from the buffet, which was much appreciated. But for $11 you can get an omlet and toast and for $3 more a cup of coffee you would expect better service! At the pool I saw the slowest moving drink server I have ever encountered! But the $5.50 Medilla Light (local Beers) were reasonably priced for a resort like this. I dont think they actually put alcohol in the daquiris and pina coladas, so stick to beer!Overall, the grounds and nice room was worth it! Yes, we did spend money in cabs to go to Isla Verde to the beach and to go to dinner each night in Old San Juan or Condado, (walk to subway for lunch... its cheaper and the service is better) but thats the price you pay for a resort in a city. The restaurants we went to were Parrot Club (Old San Juan), Aliji Mojili and Zabo (Both in Condado) and I highly recommend each of them!

<Content>A little shabby and no casino Hi, we stayed for 4 nights at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan. We paid 350 a night and found out on our way out about the 28 dollar resort fee and of course the 17 percent tax rate. What is the room rate for we wondered. We found out after we got there that there was no longer a Casino... someone said something abour irregularities and they lost license. Maybe will add one in 2007. The hotel beaches and pools look nice and they have plenty of chairs etc. The restaurants are uninspiring but the breakfast buffet was very good buy at 18 dollars incl champagne. The room had an ocean view but the room itself was sort of worn looking. We got the triple A rate after we arrived because it was 3:30 and I mentioned we could still cancel by 4. The hotel clerk where I made the reservation had insisted that the orig rate was the lowest and did not suggest AAA. It was a holiday weekend and we had to take something, we were in PR for a funeral. Without a Casion in PR I am not sure what the resort fee is for over and above the room fee. I am guessing they do not make as much money without the Casino and so added on this fee for more income. Don't have the bottle of water they leave out in the room or it will cost you 7 dollars.

<Content>Not to Hilton standards I now understand the mixed reviews for at the Caribe Hilton. We stayed there pre-cruise and post-cruise recently - and what a difference 7 days made! The first night was fair - room was not ready well after check-in time but we were compensated with a drink on the house for our inconvenience. The bar service was very slow and what surprised me the most was that the servers at the bar were not allowed to handle cash and make change -- they had to take money to a cashier station to log their transaction before providing change - this made the process very tedious and slow -- this also designates that they have a trust issue with the bar staff - not good. The room was adequate - in the renovated tower, with sliding glass door and balcony with ocean view. Bed was very comfortable but leaking toilet kept us awake much of the night. Noticed peeling paint that was in need of repair. The service in the Palmeras restaurant that night was very good. Had an excellent cruise on Celebrity Constellation - topnotch service, all the way! What a downer to return to the Caribe Hilton post-cruise and experience an entirely different experience. The room was not ready (again) and this time no drink coupons (consistency?). We were in the old tower this time. The view was spectacular once again, however, what's with the old wooden rotted door from the 1950's leading our to the balcony? - and the rust stains on the carpet? - and more peeling paint? - (at least the toilet didn't leak this time) - but the bath was missing soap dish and more peeling paint in the bath area. In the hallway, there are housekeepers sitting on the floor. Dinner again at the Palmeras, but this time the service was awful. Server was rude and unattentive, but manager ended up comping our meal when we brought it to her attention. But the worst was yet to come: Upon returning to the room after an evening out in Old San Juan, went out on the balcony for a nightcap and a last look at the beautiful view. The old rotted wooden door closes behind us and LOCKS! - We are locked out on the 8th floor balcony at 4:00 am! - very scary, no one around, no security down below. We end up having to remove the old rotted panel at the bottom of the door to let ourselves back in. We call resident manager and ask to be moved to another room. They said they would patch up the door for the night instead. But after we explained all the other issues with our stay, we were moved to another room (in the new tower). I'll never forget the stay at Caribe Hilton and would never stay there again. (We paid $280/night for this) -- True, the view is beautiful and the landscaping was impressive - but isn't it what's inside that counts sometimes? and the staff? and the management? - that's what's lacking at Caribe Hilton.

<Content>Great experience at the Hilton We stayed at the Caribe Hilton from March 18-22, 2005. After reading reviews on the Hilton I was a bit skeptical but we got a good deal for a last minute trip to Puerto Rico. We stayed in the Main building on the fourth floor. We had a view of the lobby ceiling below us but straight ahead we had a view of the Normandie and the beach. I think for the price (probably the resource we used) and the last minute booking, for the exception of the ceiling below us we had a wonderful view. Being able to wake up hearing the ocean and seeing the waves every morning was perfect. Our shower was not draining properly and it was fixed right away. The services was great. We have no complaints. It is in a perfect location between OSJ and the Condado, Isla Verde area. If we are to go back to Puerto Rico we will return to Caribe Hilton.

<Content>Beautiful Grounds! I read many reviews about hotels in San Juan before choosing one. After reading all the reviews, I still had a hard time choosing one. Even the ones that got good reviews still got many really bad reviews and they were quite pricey as well. I ended up going with the pricey one, because I thought perhaps I would at least not end up in a Cockroach palace or something. Well, I was quite pleased with the Caribe Hilton. I stayed there 3 days in February 2005 pre-cruise. I paid $1,120 for the 3 nights which included the breakfast buffet. The room was very nice and very clean. There was no mold anywhere in the room (as other reviews I read said they had terrible mold in the room). I thought the hotel was pretty...lobby and all. The grounds were just wonderful - just like a mini paradise. The only thing I was bummed about is that there was no heated Jacuzzi which I think should have been there considering the prices! We had a 4th floor room in the tower. Like a dummy, I left the sliding glass door open all night thinking that mosquitoes don't fly up that high...wrong! I was eaten alive. I had the biggest bites I have ever got in my life! Funny, I never saw one mosquito or bug! They do automatically add a $1 donation per person and per night to some charity, but I just had them take it off my bill when checking out (when I checked in, they did tell me I could have it taken off). As far as the food goes, I thought it was very good and prices were average for the beautiful and yummy breakfast buffet and for the lovely dinners. Room service was very reasonably priced and served quickly and set up very elegantly! All in all, I definitely recommend the Caribe Hilton if you don't mind paying top dollar. Just one more thing I should mention, I have stayed at just as nice (if not a little nicer) hotels in Orlando and Tampa, FL for less than $100/night. I guess San Juan is just pricey for hotels! If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me.

<Content>Back from the Caribe just got back from 4 days at the Caribe Hilton. I would say it was an average hotel. The fist room we were given was dirty and had trash all over, the next room did not have the ocean view we paid for. It was also noisy at night on our floor. On the positive side, the beach and pool area are wondeful.

<Content>Viva the Caribe Hilton We had a great time at the Caribe Hilton. THere is no casino but with two kids (6 and 11 mo.) we didn't go away to gamble. The beach and pool are great for families. The staff was wonderful..the key to this hotel is the location between Old San Juan and the Condado. We did Old San Juan in the morning before the heat and the Condando at night.The hotel is a secluded hideaway next to the Condada and Old S.J. Perfect for families and those looking for a low key spot with activities moments away.For those reviewers who bemoan taking a $8-10 taxi ride ..this hotel isn't for them. If you want action all the time go to the Condado or Isla Verde. Peace and relaxation at the El Caribe..a trademark of this hotel since 1945.

<Content>Do not spend your money here This place is a dump. It is suppose to be a 5 star hotel, but in reality is only a two. The staff is indifferent, the prices were very high (2 drinks at the lobby bar for $24), and the rooms were horrible. We had a room overlooking the garden, which is under construction. The construction begins at 6am and continues until the sun goes down. The beach area was ok, as was the pool; however that is the only positive thing I can say about this place. Stay at the Marriott down the street.

<Content>Beware--Security is an issue! Stayed there from 2/19-2/25.....nice room in the tower building but had quite a few incidents where i did not feel safe. First off, the tower building is very far away from the lobby and there is NO security there, anyone can walk in off the street and have access to the floors above. There is an eye in the sky type device in the lobby. Opened my door one evening to find a couple milling about, they saw me and hurried away towards the stairs , not the elevators. The beach is nice, as well as the pool, until you realize that a fairly large amount of the people there are locals who have no business being there. An older boy approached my 7 year old son ( he was 14-15) and said he was there with his mother and was staying at the hotel next door. He asked him if he wanted to leave the property if he wanted to go see the pool over there When my son asked permission, I approached the mother and they hurriedly took off. I had read in the paper where there is an epidemic of kidnappings in Latin American countries, with children being sold into slavery, and heres my kid about to leave the property (lured?) When I complained to the manager, they ignored me and said that there is a private club that the local people can belong to and that there are members there who are locals. When I persisted and told him that i would notify the police, he dared me to go ahead, this is a private matter the police wont get involved in Other incidents occurred and they are too numerous to mention. And this is only in one week! The bottom line is that for this amount of money ( 385 night, plus 20 percent taxes) they should take security a lot more seriously. Someone is going to get raped or kidnapped one of these days! THIS is not a place I would take children to nor would I feel comfortable as a single women being here alone. If you are a married couple and you stay together the whole time, than I guess its ok. But ,There are too many other nice places that take security seriously and do not treat you with an attitude that they do here!

<Content>Wonderful vacation spot! We returned from a week's stay at the Caribe Hilton. We also stayed the first week in February last year . We were on the 4th floor in the main building with a wonderful view of the ocean. Last year we were in the same building on 6th floor. Room was large, very clean and comfortable. Maid service replaced used towels twice a day and did a superb job. Room service was always on time and meals were as ordered.   We ate at all 4 of the hotel's restaurants and enjoyed them. Morton's was our favorite but the Spanish one and Italian one were very good. The Palmeras was our least favorite for dinner but the buffet breakfast was a great treat with wonderful fruit and great cooked to order items. Thought the $18.50 price to be reasonable for the value received.  The grounds are especially beautiful with a great pool with swim-up bar and loads of grounds to stretch out for a wonderful tan. The Hilton has the only private beach in Puerto Rico and it is well protected from large waves by a man made barrier that is a about 200 feet out from the beach area. It is safe and clean; I noticed hotel employees making rounds daily and gathering up clumps of seaweed and other items to assure a clean and safe area. Anyone with little children would appreciate the beach area.  The common areas are well kept and attractive. While the first floor lobby area is open, I never saw a bug (flying or ground type) in there the entire week. In February, the hotel is not exactly inexpensive but for a winter retreat from the snow-belt, it was a bargain to us.   The location is good. It is between the congested Condado beach area and Old San Juan. Both are a $8 cab ride or, probably, a 30 minute walk. For access to some of the wonderful Old San Juan restaurants, I found the location very convenient, safe and desireable. We'll probably return next February.

<Content>So So My Husband and I just returned from spending 5 nights at the Caribe Hilton. Our trip was part business, a trade show and part vacation. The location of the hotel is good, not far from Old San Juan and not far from Condado. However, the rooms exhibited wear and tear. It's time for a major renovation to the sleeping rooms. The public areas , the pool, lobby and the health club were very nice. The pool is beautiful and the restaurants are very nice. I would consider staying there again if they renovate, otherwise, next year I will look for a new hotel.

<Content>It was better than I had expected...but still not the greatest Okay, I visited the Caribe Hotel and after reading the reviews I was a bit terrified at what to expect. I actually took some of the reviews with me to show the front desk if they tried to pull some of the stuff some of the other reviewers said. Sure enough, right when we got there the man at the front desk said that our room wasn't ready and if we would stay in a side room and sleep on a sofa bed for that night then the next night our deluxe room with a queen size bed would be ready. Needless to say I waived the reviews in his face and told him that I had read that the Caribe did this (not having people's rooms ready) He promised the room would be ready and that they would even move our stuff. The next morning we went down and the room wasn't ready...one more night he said. The next day we got our room. Third day there though. Also yes it is off the road and we had to take taxis to everywhere. Also there was a big storm our last night and we got in a taxi and they shut down all the roads practically...we drove around for at least 45 mins. had to pay this woman something for taking us right back to our hotel. We ate at the Madrid Tapas restaurant and the food was good. Recommend Ajili Mojili which is across the bridge by all the other resorts. The concierge was somewhat helpful in finding restaurants and clubs to go to. Overall, it was okay. Grounds are beautiful though...if you like laying outside and relaxing...private beach is great for that.

<Content>2nd time just as good This was our second time at the Caribe Hilton. We use Hilton Honors points for our stay, and when we checked in didn't get the room we had requested. I talked with the manager and we had to stay first night in the room they had. Only when I went to the Hilton Honors desk, did we get confirmation that they would move us to the requested room. (The rooms in the tower are much nicer.)Now the good part. Delta lost my 5 year olds bag. Sonya at the concerige worked night and day to get it back. The room we had in the tower was fantastic. The pools were clean and fun. The Hilton Honors breakfast bar and happy hour bar were a nice treat. The activities were fun. Especially for the children. They had a big arcade for rainy weather, taxi's available 24/7. Old San Juan was only $8 ride in a taxi. The travel excursions were a bit pricey, and we stayed at the pool most of the time anyways. The spa/excercise facility was state of the art. The restaurant in the spa was really good for healthy lunch. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Donna West Hartford, CT

<Content>Its a good hotel in an OK island Stayed at the Caribe Hilton for a week from 1/31/05 to 2/4/05 and found it to be a good hotel but VERY overpriced. Then again overpriced is the theme in San Juan Puerto Rico.They just spent $60 million renovating the hotel but some sections of the hotel are still not quite up to date. The hotel has a nice beach and pool area but is not within walking distance of anything. Thats where the overpriced taxis come into play.If you must go to Puerto Rico, then this is a good choice among the hotels in San Juan (if you can get past the $18.50 breakfat buffet and $7 bottle of water from the mini bar). If you have an option go to the Dominican Republic or Mexico and spend 1/2 of the money on eveything.

<Content>Average Hotel I just returned from the Carbie Hilton, from a 6 night stay, after reading the mixed reviews from this website, i took mostly potivite things from it. The hotel is somewhat set back from the road, with very nice landscaping, the lobby has no doors, so the breeze was enjoyable while waiting on the long line. When you get the chance to check in, it was fast, but there was a reasonable line. We stayed in a Garden view room, which i am not sure if it was the oldest section, but it seemed that way. It was a decent size, two double beds, but we had some complaints. Our phone was broken, and after a couple of calls to the front desk it still wasn't fixed. The lighting in the bathroom was horrible, the closet door didn't close, both the toilet paper holder and the soap holder (in the shower) were broken. Around all the edges of the entire room and bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a long time. The air conditioning vent was clogged with dust, it only made me think of what we were breathing in, not sanitary. There were stains on the rug, dirty windows and occasionally the TV would flicker. All along the halls, they have a molding that comes halfway up the wall, the molding was falling off and we saw a sworm of tiny ants, right in front of our door. The view was nice if you kept your head straight up, but if you looked down there was construction. If you are a light sleeper, you would have been woken up by the drills and the machines, and also the Peacocks. Most of these things aren't horrible and i hate to sound picky, but when you pay $400 a night for a room, the little things should be fixed. The grounds were very nice and clean, tons of staff, if it is possibly they should clean the lagoon, there was tons of garbage floating around. Everything there is way overpriced, breakfast buffet is $18.50 a morning. Your waitor comes to the table, asks if you want coffee and you don't see them again. When the bill comes, there is a little saying on the paper to tip your waitor the suggested 15%. Im sorry but i am not paying someone any extra for saying 5 words, and that is it. If you don't tip them, they don't seem very happy either. The same thing goes for all the bartenders, the taxi boys, valet and everyone there that is wearing a shirt. Not to mention when we recieved our bill at the end of our stay, the hilton charged us a dollar a day to donate to their foundation, without permission, so be aware.We never had a problem finding a taxi, yet again overpriced, my problem with this hotel, is the location. You have to take a taxi everywhere, and there is nothing around the hotel. A taxi is at least $10 for about 5 minutes, it is a drive everywhere, we walked near the marriot one night and it took 45 minutes. If i could suggest to stay anywhere it would be the Wyndam Condado Plaza, or the Marriot, it is ideal if you don't want to spend every waking moment at the hotel. There are restauraunts and clubs accross the street from the Wyndam and the Marriot, more ideal location. We went horseback riding through the hotel, overpriced, but had so much fun, we went snorkling at the hotel, and there isn't anything to see except cloudy water, we ate at the italian restauraunt in the hotel, and spent $84 on two people, not including drinks, wayy over priced but the food was excellent. The outdoor eatery is all fried food, we had Mortons one night for desert and it took 30 minutes, and it was average. All in all, this hotel has no night life, but a lot to offer during the day, when you have a hotel so secluded a larger nightlife should be necessary, the rooms were below average and the grounds were above average. Like I said, if you are comming here to stay in the hotel to whole time, it is nice, but if you are looking for something to do, not the best place. Hope i helped.

<Content>Caribe Hilton was great ! We spent 7 nights at the Caribe Hilton from Jan 5th - 12th. Had a nice quiet and clean room. Staff friendly, courteous and helpful. Beach and pool area clean. Surrounding park area near the hotel was great for walking. Only negative comment , the entertainment at night ,female singer, at the bar near the lobby was too loud . Could not relax and read in the lobby during the entertainment. Would definitely go back to the Caribe Hilton.

<Content>Nice, clean hotel We saw mixed reviews here and decided to stay at the Caribe Hilton anyway. We were not dissapointed. We stayed in the tower, which has refurbished rooms that were nicely appointed. The bathroom is incredible: large, with dual sinks, marble, and rainforest shower that will easily fit two people. Pool area is lush and nice. Pool was completely clean and clear while we were there. There is no outdoor hottub however which was disappointing. We ate at Madrid's Tapas and had a wonderful meal and great service. The hotel is on it's own little penisula, not far from both Condado and Old San Juan areas. Very walkable area, although not especially close to eateries and stores. Would stay here again.

<Content>dont go here! Definately in a seedy area! WE were scared apon arrival, and we live in the Bronx. The room the gave us was on the side of hotel were construction was going on, so we asked for a room change immediatly. WE ot it but the next room wasn't any better. The pool has garbage in it, like alot of plastic cups. The nightly entertainment is a cheesy and screeching woman, who the locals like. Taxis to Isle Verde and Old San Juan are not cheap, so just stay in one of those areas. Avoid this hotel no matter how good the deal. Actually if you are looking for an affordable  beautiful carribean spot, avoid Puerto Rico, just go to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.

<Content>not the best! Just got back from spending 5 days in the executive suite area. I agree with a previous review-- they need new towels- they feel like old cleaning rags. Too bad because it really is a nice hotel, very relaxing but not very clean. DO not eat in the Spain of Madrid restaurant.. found bug in water andd they did not care. Great restaurant not too many know off only rich locals-- La Casona, excellent food and service. Also, Ropa Vieja excellent Puerto Rico and Cuban cuisine. Never visit when a new Governor is taking power.. Hotel was full of security, could not get taxis. Too many areas closed off. Not to the benefit of guests who paid $441.00 per night plus another $120.00 for hotel tarriff and taxes.Overall, the hotel is nice and it is too bad that they do not invest money in a casino, new towels and upgrade their cleaning service.

<Content>Great Time We stayed for 6 nights at the Caribe and had a good experience. I'm a Diamond member and the benefits paid off. The Executive lounge was well staffed, had a good breakfast and a great cocktail selection and hours. We only ate dinner at one of the restaurants onsite, the Tapas Room and the food was excellent. We had lunch at the Olas Spa. Its a great option for the healthy eater. The lunches there were very well and the service was great. The location was ideal as you could go 5 minutes in one direction and go to a number of great restaurants in Old City and 5 minutes in the other direction to Condado. The gym in the health spa was great, even better than most gyms you would pay for. The lagoon area/beach was very nice and well kept. The room was well appointed and nicely furnished. The balcony was tiny, we didn't bother trying to sit out on it at all and it overlooked the top of the lower section of the building with a huge air vent..not too appealing but could be easily overlooked.All in all.. a really nice option for downtown San Juan area..we would definitely go back..

<Content>Wonderful Hotel! My husband and I just returned from a 7-day cruise on the Celebrity Constellation - that's a complete review for another time (Celebrity is the BEST!). We decided to stay overnight prior to the cruise which sailed from San Juan. We are fairly loyal to the Hilton, and the Caribe did not disappoint us at all. We chose a junior king suite on the executive floor, and were quite shocked that the executive lounge included complimentary drinks for happy hour (that is unusual for the Hilton), including Champagne and all top shelf brands. The room was very spacious and clean. The restaurant in the lobby (more of a lobby bar) was quite good with the best Pina Coladas we ever tasted. This Hilton is the birth place of the Pina Colada and is currently celebrating it's (the drink's) 50th anniversary! The location is superb, right on the beach, and every room has a balcony overlooking some part of the ocean. If there was anything that was a disappointment, our view from room #801 was a little of the ocean, and a lot of roof... I would strongly suggest that you visit the Caribe Hilton. It is upscale, and a little higher priced, but well worth the money!

<Content>Rooms were nice but the noise was out of control Went to San Juan in March of 04 stayed there for an extended weekend. The staff was very friendly and the rooms were pretty nice. However our room overlooked the garden area and the peacocks kept us up most of the night. I believe it was a white male that was the culprit.They made so much noise at times it was just unbelieveable. Also they were doing construction on part of the hotel so usually we were up all night with the peacocks and then up very early in the morning with the construction workers. Not sure if they are finished their renovations by now but beware!Also we ate breakfast at the resturant there near the pool ONCE and it was in my opinion very expensive, also there were bugs flying around and in the pastries. We soon discovered a little resturant right across the street from the hotel where we ate breakfast for a third of the cost of the breakfast at the hotel. I was also disappointed in the beaches or lack there of but I'm sure that's just mother nature and has nothing to do with the hotel.

<Content>Beautiful Resort My husband and I stayed at the Caribe for three nights early December, pre-cruise. We booked direct through Hilton, not a Price-line, etc. We paid $195/night for Executive level and were in the main building on the 10th (top) floor. The executive lounge was on the 9th floor. We had an ocean view with a small balcony.The check-in was easy; we were able to check in on the 9th floor executive lounge. The room was plenty spacious and clean. The grounds were incredible! We did not use the pool, but there were always plenty of loungers at it. We preferred the beach area and never had a problem getting a nice quiet spot.The staff were all quite friendly. The staff in the executive lounge were superb. Free continental breakfast; free happy hour with cocktails, wine, and appetizers from 5:30 - 8:00; and cordials and desserts (cookies, etc) from 8:00 - 10:00.Hotel has a nice workout facility (a short walk down the beach in a different building). There is also a spa facility in this building. Tennis courts are also available. Water sports rental (mats, etc) available. We brought our own snorkeling gear and snorkelled out near the rock barrier; saw quite a few fish.Within walking distance to OSJ (about 35 minutes) and Condado (about 35 minutes). As mentioned, very limited in restaurants nearby. We did find a local Puerto Rican diner about 2 blocks away that had tasty local dishes. No shopping close by. We really enjoyed our hikes into OSJ and Condado (different days!).I would have no probelm staying at this resort again. It would also be a nice place to stay for a longer land based vacation as opposed to precruise.

<Content>Progressively Getting Worst The swimming pools are poorly kept with obvious signs of only GAWD knows what in the water. The Palmeras restaurant buffet seems to always be infested with fruit flies....you're better off staying at the San Juan Mariott for the money you pay here. There are no other restaurants close to this hotel so you are basically stuck with what's available at their inflated prices. The rooms are Ok - the service could be better. If you don't drink liquor have them seal the refrigerator...else they'll try to charge you for missing items. Not a pleasant experience.

<Content>Hilton? Stayed at the Hilton with caution after viewing the mixed reviews. The lobby and landscaping at this location is beautiful, the pool is a bit dated looking. The first room assigned on the 11 th floor with Ocean view in the back building was HORRIBLE. Rust stains on the carpet, stains in the ceiling and the bathroom was terrible. Hilton hotels in general are on the down swing. At this property the hotel has decided to renovate certain floors. Stay on the 18th floor, this is where we moved. The room was much better but still not up to Hiltons old standards. The staff was somewhat helpful but many were rude, usually a sign of bad management and/or a bad corporate culture. The location is not as good as the Marriott. The towels were also like paper towels. I would rate the rooms a 1 star and the lobby and pool a two star. The carpet in the halls and most rooms needs to be changed. The breakfast buffet is excellent.

<Content>Great Experience We stayed here pre-cruise for one night, Sunday October 24, 2004, myself, my spouse and my parents. The rooms and the hotel far exceeded my expectations, especially considering the mixed reviews I have read here. The arrangements were made through Celebrity. Both rooms were overlooking the beach and the pool, on the Executive Level, they were spacious, bright, clean and overall were great! The Executive Level included a lounge with Continental Breakfast, Complimentary Coffees, Afternoon Hors D'oeuvres, Cocktail Hour, and Evening Coffee with cordials, all complimentary.  We had dinner at Morton's Steak house, it was great, expensive, but in line with every other Morton's Steak House. The breakfast buffet was very good, wine, champagne all out, so you could help yourself to mimosas, the food in the buffet was very good as well. The grounds were meticulously maintained, the pool and beach were great. The staff was professional and very friendly, really wished we could have stayed longer than a day, will definitely go back for a vacation there in the near future.

<Content>Very nice place to stay I stayed here in April, 2004. The rooms were spacious and clean. The beach is rather small if you like to lay on the sand. The pool area offers plenty of room to lounge. However, be prepared to get up very early to get a chair. They go fast! The service was great and the food was very good. It's in a great location and a taxi to shopping and restaurants in San Juan.

<Content>Great Hotel I go to Puerto Rico 2-3 times a year for the past 17 years and I have been to the ritzy hotels and I always go back to the Caribe Hilton. The night entertainment is great as well as the location is close to everything from shopping to restaurants. The pool is right off the beach and the entertainment is great for both adults as well as for families traveling with children.

<Content>Pleased with the Caribe After seeing the mixed reviews about the Hilton Caribe, we went with our gut feeling and decided to try it anyway. I must say that my boyfriend and I were very pleased with our choice. The property itself was spacious, clean and well maintained. Also the benefit of having our own private beach was phenomenal. The staff, as a whole was also courteous. As previous reviews had stated, the island is very humid, which may have potentially lead to the level of mildew content our oriinal room contained. (rm 1669)We asked to switch rooms and it was done so immediately. The mildew scent was at a minimum and the view was fantastic. (roon 1863 to be exact) The breakfast was great. (A little pricey, but very goood.) All in all, after actually going to San Juan and visiting the other hotels to see what we had passed up to stay at the Caribe, I must say that we were pleased with our choice and will definitely be returning.

<Content>Caribe was Great! Spent 10 days in SJ in early September. Was a little apprehensive about staying at Caribe Hilton after seeing so many mixed reviews. However, at great rate of $74 per night via Priceline, we couldn't resist. Room was perfect---clean and in very good condition. Balcony overlooked beautiful pools and the beach. The ongoing construction is on the other side of the hotel. Staff very efficient and courteous, especially Sandy at the front desk. Only complaints would be about the restaurants: food just fair and overpriced. Much more enjoyable to visit local restaurants to sample the PR specialities and atmosphere instead of a chain restaurant, such as Morton's at the hotel. Location is perfect---short drive to Old San Juan and the Condado strip. On next trip to PR, will stay at the Caribe again. Even during the Tues night and Wed when Hurricane Jeanne hit, there were no problems. During the worst of the storm, the free coffee bar in the lobby was a busy meeting spot for many guests talking about their first hurricane experience. When we left on Thursday, grounds were cleaned up and again in perfect condition.

<Content>nice place The hotel was great and the location can't be beat for the price. But in reference to a previous posting that mentions once you leave the U.S. you have to not expect U.S. standards I don't know if they realized that they were still in the U.S. So that comment was ridiculous.

<Content>Caribe convenience can't be beat I love this resort. It is conveniently located between Old San Juan and other parts of the city. The private beach cannot be beat. I got a great rate on the executive floor that made it all worth it. This is my third time at the Caribe and I have been to almost all of the better hotels in Puerto Rico. While the restaurants are expensive, each of them has their own style and the food and service is good. On the weekends, the beach services are perfect for the kids.On the downside, there is always a funny smell in the hallways. The housekeeping staff is only average. I had a room that overlooked the construction site, but I only heard noise when out on the balcony.I spent 4 nights by myself and never felt lonely. I would recommend this hotel to business travelers, families or couples going for a quick weekend away.

<Content>Not up to Hilton Standards I stayed at this hotel while on a business trip. Overall, my comment is that for the price, this hotel is not a great value. I鈥檝e itemized the pluses and minues at the bottom of this review. The price you pay will greatly influence your satisfaction rating. My corporate rate is $145/night which is similar to the rate you can get directly from Hilton if you are willing to prepay your stay at time of reservation without refund. I would not recommend that so as to allow you to checkout if you are disappointed after the first night. You will definitely be happy with this hotel should you be able to snag a room for $100/night (a rate I've never seen). However, I checked many places and the average rate is above $200 which is too much for this property unless the rooms undergo a major renovation (none scheduled that I know of).First of all, arriving at night in a rental car, the signage for the hotel is poor. Gold lettering on a brown stone wall is partially obscured by a tree for the small alley-width road leading to the hotel. The best direction is to head straight for the Normandie hotel which is clearly visible in front of you, and the Hilton is to your right. Check-in is conveniently located just off a circular driveway where you can park temporarily without a hassle. Valet parking is also readily available with plenty of personnel to shuttle the cars. No bell hop offered to get my bag or look after it. So, after check-in, I drove around the driveway and down the alley to their parking garage, a facility with in/out privileges at $10/day ($20/day valet). I ordered room service at 10:45pm which arrived within 45 minutes as they stated.The biggest nice surprise of the whole visit was that night when I had trouble enabling the in-room broadband, the hotel operator came up to personally fix it within five minutes. That鈥檚 five-star service.2/3 of the bottom level of the six-story garage is enclosed in a really tacky exhibition center where cheapo conferences take place. The days I was here, I saw temporary card tables set up with various wares such as cosmetics and crafts - dunno exactly what was going on. I mention this because the garage is small, so taking 2/3 of the first level for this purpose is questionable. After parking, I wheeled my luggage the medium far distance back to the hotel where my room was in the main building. The main building is a non-descript rectangular box aligned roughly perpendicular to the ocean. This allows most rooms on each side to have ocean views. Back in the 50's, when this box was constructed, the space on either side was not built up. Now, however, the fort side of the building, where my room was located, contains a large two-story ballroom building that extends a couple hundred feet out from the building. This means that all rooms on this side of the building overlook the roof of the ballroom area. In addition, as previously mentioned, the condo building construction continues which obscures yet more precious beachfront.My room was a plain, non-suite, which is typical of Hiltons all over the world. Nothing inside eludes of five-star luxury, nor does it have Motel 6 plainness. The AC unit is the old style wall mount with an updated digital thermostat. It chilled OK but did a so-so job of dehumidification that is typical of low-end AC units that do not have a separate dehumidify mode. The grill shows rust and corrosion, as does the door closer to the hallway. The bathroom has mold on the caulk line of the tub. The bathroom phone did not have dialtone, and the toilet does not shut off completely.I used the health club one afternoon. Machines include 6 treadmills (one down for service), one elliptical, one or two star steppers, a dozen or so resistance machines, and two or three free-weight positions. The club is part of the spa complex that includes the spa facility and a small cafe with tennis courts behind. The club is a simple, beautiful design with a roof sloping upward to the ocean side that is a wall of windows with the $1M view. The opposite and side walls have mirrors reflecting theocean view. TV's are placed too high to be viewable from the treadmills, but I found the ocean view to be preferable to watching CNN. The attendant provides towel service, and there are small lockers you can use (no locker room or showers that I could see, though). Resistance machines show wear on the fabric that needs to be replaced.I swam in the pool one morning at 7am (didn't realize the pool actually opens at 8am). Security saw me but didn't bother me. The main pool is 4ft deep and suitable for swimming laps only if you arrive in the very early a.m. Otherwise, as in all hotel pools everywhere, screaming kids rule until the pool closes in the evening. Additional pools ofvarying depths are interconnected, and there's a swim-up bar in the uppermost pool. The adjoining area provides plenty of choices for relaxing. Lounges with freshly cleaned cushions were already in place at 7am, as were the beach towels. You can choose from shady spots in the palm tree area or sunny spots along the beach. As the sun sets, the sand beach area is shaded. Speaking of the beach, many reviewers complainabout it but the bottom line for me is that for this area of San Juan, it's of pretty decent size and and well maintained (in comparison to the Normandie or Wyndham for example which are nearby and I also checked out).I checked out but did not use the beach locker room area which is conveniently located off the beach area on the bottom level of the hotel. The ceiling height is low here. The facility was clean but I didn't get a good feeling about leaving items in a locker there (you can padlock it). I'd recommend keeping your personal items with you or with a friend while you're in the pool.You won't see many young adults or beautiful people sunbathing here. In general, the guests I saw were late 30's to senior citizens, of medium to overweight but not obese build. Most women are conservative with their swimwear here which probably also goes along with the older clientele.I asked for some advice from the concierge and the travel desk, both of which are located off the open-air lobby.The travel desk was not helpful when I wanted to go on a tour Monday at 9:30am. I asked about the rain forest and was told I missed the only tour for the day, and that the cave tours only occur Wednesday-Sunday (maybe through their pre-arranged hotel pickup that's probably true but it's really external companies who do the tours and she could have called around or asked). She gave me incorrect directions to the rain forest (the road to the rain forest did NOT intersect the main highway). She did not offer any suggestions to explore this beautiful country and was not a person with the right attitude to be working in that position at the hotel.From the concierge, I asked for a recommendation for an off-site restaurant such as a pancake house that is breakfast-oriented. She said there are no pancake houses in Puerto Rico, and recommended the hotel restaurant that I said I'd been to but was tired of. I did end up eating there again for their $20 breakfast buffet which costs approximately the same as if you order pancakes, sausage, and eggs ala carte (drink not included). I went back to the concierge another morning and the guy was reading the paper and engaged in a conversation with another hotel employee who was sitting there. He did notice me and gave me the map I requested. A rack of literature was located next to this desk, all of which were the standard fare that tour companies and shopping centers give to the hotels for free).I ate in the main restaurant several times (breakfast x2, dinner x1, sunday brunch). The dining room is pleasant with windows facing the pool and ocean; you can also eat outside. Sunday brunch was the biggest rip-off at $30. It's similar to the breakfast buffet but offers carved meats (which were gone and not replenished during my meal), and some seafood. During the brunch, ordering off the menu is not offered. Many kids were running around free in the restaurant area (just like at Old Country Buffet in the states if anyone has ever been there). Young kids eat free, and older ones get a discount. At the breakfast brunch one morning, I walked up to the cook and asked for a freshly made omelet to order that he made no problem. However, I don't know if this was a protocol violation as this was the place where waiters placed their orders with the cooks. Steam table eggs were readily available as were a good variety of all the normal breakfast items.Checkout was speedy. I did ask about the $8.75/day resort fee that was added to my bill, and they told me it was part of the room fee.Pluses- nice health club, nice view with wall of windows overlooking the ocean. This is such a pleasantchange from the average hotel club which is located in the basement or another room without windows- beautiful pool area, clean, inviting- pretty beachfront (for the area). Hotels and condos swallow up most of the land here and this one has one of the nicer maintained private beach areas - not huge, though- Louisa the hotel operator, who at 11pm my first nights stay diagnosed a problem with the hotel broadband and personally brought and installed an Ethernet cable within five minutes of me talking with her - Brava!- late-night room service- convenient distance to airportMinuses- $15/night for in-room broadband, free at most business-class hotels these days- $5/15 minutes for wireless broadband in the lobby area, free at most business-class hotels these days- no mini-fridge, standard at most business class hotels these days. They will deliver one subjectto availability if you ask, though.- business lounge is tiny (3-4 tables), and free continental breakfast is just pastries no hot items- no restaurants within walking distance- bell hops where are you? Front desk didn't ask if I needed baggage assistance at check-in.- parking garage is too small (and will get worse as the condos next door start getting occupants)- breakfast buffet is approximately $20, pancakes with meat $10, $18 if you want eggs, too. drink notincluded.- hotel signage difficult to see from the road - hotel entrance road is tiny. banning parking on itwould be a good idea to make two-way passage easier- as in many tired, aging Hiltons worldwide, minor room issues: rusty grill on AC unit and door closer, mold along tub line, bathroom phone no dial tone, leaky toilet, mold/cleaning fluid smell from carpet- no HBO on room TV, just basic cable channels- beware of the bottle of water in your room. Hhonors members will think this is the free bottle you get at most Hiltons. However, this bottle costs you $7 charged to your room- sunday lunch buffet costs $30. Same basic buffet sans carved meats costs $15 nightly. Drink not included.- $8.75/day resort fee added to room charge. I inquired about this and they said it's part of the hotel fee and can't be deleted. This wasn't advertised when I reserved my room.- $1/day kids charity fee added to room charge (can be deleted)- 2/3 of the bottom story of the parking garage converted to an enclosed exhibition center where low-budget functions take place (indivduals renting booths setting up their card tables to hawk their goods and services). Tacky not Hilton caliber.- karaoke lady singing almost every night in the open lounge bar area, often until 3am or more (party went to 5am one night I was there). She is OK quality, but ofa caliber you'd expect to hear in a Holiday Inn off the interstate not in a five-star Carribbean resort.A small live band with island music would be nice.- expensive restaurants, and too many of them (seven). Most of the restaurants have extremely low occupancy (spa cafe, spanish restaurant, Italian? restaurant). Converting one to an enclosed SportsBar might be nice.- beware of the bottle of water in your room. Hhonors members will think this is the free bottle you get at most Hiltons. However, this bottle costs you $7 charged to your room- sunday lunch buffet costs $30. Same basic buffet sans carved meats costs $15 nightly. Drink not included.Speaking of that condo project Paseo Caribe next door...- Part of the site was owned by the Navy, and another was an outdoor parking lot owned by the Hilton(shame on the Navy for selling it vs. leaving it as a national park with the historic 1500's fort whichof course they are leaving intact)- It's not just a condo project; they anticipate a whole shopping complex with movie theaters, casino, etc.- The condos will invite more transient residents. Owners are not anticipated to live there- Guess who will be managing the timeshare condo arrangements? The HILTON.- So in fact, rich investors are using the condo as an investment and revenue source vs. as a residence and the Hilton is using the property as a hotel within a hotel (their words). They get a nice, new property to manage without spending all the capital (wonder if they will pump some of that back into renovating the 1950's main hotel building)?- Scheduled for completion in August, 2004, as of this writing, the building is still aconcrete shell, and they now anticipate a phased approach stretching out fully into 2005.

<Content>Not what you expect from Hilton We stayed at the Caribe Hilton on July 24, 2004 for one night prior to our cruise. We got in rather late and were given a room that smelled moldy and had wet carpet. I called to complain about the situation and was not offered any alternative. The next morning we tried to eat breakfast but the restaurant had a horde of people in a big line waiting to eat. The view off our balcony was mainly a construction site. Other members of my family stayed there also and were put in rooms on the concierge floor for less money than I spent and had a decent stay. The management has given me a 50% refund on our room. I would try somewhere else next time.

<Content>Enjoyed the Caribe We stayed at the Caribe Hilton for six nights in May, 2003 and were very satisfied with the property. The hotel itself is ideally located adjacent to the Condado Lagoon, half way between Old and New San Juan. Hilton promotes the fact that there is an old Spanish fort on the San Geronimo grounds. This was somwhat misleading as the fort, at that time, was fenced off and appears dangerously located on the rocks and coral. That being said, Caribe Hilton had several benefits. The staff were friendly and the rooms clean. Our view overlooking the San Juan coastline was absolutely breathtaking. It was very relaxing and beautiful. There are approximately 4-5 restaurants on-site including Morton's of Chicago where my wife and I had one of our best meals ever. While the exterior facade appeared somewhat dated, the management spent considerble time and money renovating the lobby/atrium. It looks really nice when you enter the building. Having visited both the Wyndham Condado and the Marriott Stellaris, I am glad we chose the Caribe Hilton in that both Marriott and Wyndham have casinos attracting a noisier, more eccentric crowd. Another nice aspect of Caribe is a private, man-made beach with a large pool with swim-up bars. All in all, this is a four-star property. Unlike other resort stays, you will probably spend a great deal of time away from the property. Old and New San Juan have many fabulous restaurants, bars, and shops to explore. There is a car rental agency across the street with affordable rates so that you can explore the rest of the island. Puerto Rico is beautfiful. We had a great time at Caribe and would definitely stay there again the next time we visit San Juan.

<Content>Outstanding! A truly luxurious resort and hotel experience. I stayed here for 4 nights on business and have never stayed at a nicer place than this Hilton. The view was wonderful, the food great and the rooms were clean, spacious and well-kept. The only problem I had was a leaky sink in the bathroom, but who cares when everything is so fantastic. Truly awesome hotel!!

<Content>Great for the kids! How was it? Really! Overall, it's wasn't as bad as some of the previous reviews mentioned. Some of the issues are true and can be a nuisance, but what did you expect? The Ritz? The hotel is great if you have little kids. The pool area was well laid out for adults and kids. The sheltered beach area was even better for little one. There were no waves to knock them over.Our room was recently renovated and was fairly clean. The bathroom was pretty nice and had a large shower. It had a good size TV with movies and games for a fee.As I mentioned, overall it wasn't that bad. But, there were some issues that were annoying. Yes, they are renovating portions of the hotel. So, the work is done during the day and there is some noise. This is a definite problem if you are trying to take an afternoon nap. Some of the elevators did not work at times, so we had to use the service ones. It was better that the stairs from the 15th floor. The hotel does show some signs of its age, but they are making an effort to refurbish it. But, things are done a little slower in PR than the states. It's just a fact.We would stay there again, but I would try to get a better rate. It you want high service and cleanliness, go to the Ritz. That is what we did. Instead of having a disappointing vacation, we leveraged our time. We stayed at the Hilton for 3 days and the rest at the Ritz. Yes, it was a little more, but it worked out just fine.After all, it is pretty difficult to sift through all these reviews. Some are good and some are bad. We have plenty of new resort properties in Orlando and it's hard for some foreign locations to compete with the amenities and service levels we expect as Americans. Once you leave the US it's always a gamble. But, I try to be fair and honest to all involved. Your vacation time is very valuable and should be taken seriously.

<Content>Had a great time! My husband and I stayed at the Caribe Hilton to start our honeymoon before our cruise. We were a little apprehensive because of some of the other reviews on this site but we really enjoyed the hotel. First of all everyone at the hotel was very nice and we had no problems checking in three hours early either. The open air lobby is very unique and the grounds are just gorgeous! It is an older hotel but it is still nice. We also faced the fort where there was construction but we never heard a thing. We were a little unprepared for the food prices at the restaurants in the hotel, but the prices were comprable to other restaurants in the city. We had a good experience at this hotel and would definately stay there again!

<Content>Caribe Hiton is the way to go Just got back from PR on July 17. We stayed at Caribe Hilton for 8 days and this is truly one of the best hotel in San Juan area, not only according to us but also according to the locals.The hotel room is around 3 star rating, and they are a bit slow is fixing things. But the view and the lanscape of the hotel really make it worth it. When you walk out to the pool area, you will have a 240 degree view of the atlantic ocean. And at night you can see huge fish under the hotel pier. The beach turned out to be the best beach in San Juan. Trust me, we look around town for a better beach and fail.The food in the hotel is expensive, but who cares, because we love to try the local eateries. There's a sandwich shop right infront of the hotel, that sale cheap and great cuban sanwiches.PR turns out to be the best vacation place I've ever visited. And I've been to Bali and Spain as a comparison. It's like having the European feeling, US convenience in the tropical setting. Don't leave PR without visiting one of the bioluminiscent lagoon. It will blow you away.Plus point, PR use US dollars, US stamps and our cel phone work as if we're in the continental US.Rent a car. The driving is not as bad as mexico city or europe. And the trafic is comparable to Houston, Texas. Try the Paella, and Mofongo (local dish made with mashed plantain filled with meat). And learn to salsa before you get there, so you can visit one of the salsa dance places.Old San Juan is only 5 minutes from the hotel. The traffic is bad to go there, but it's so worth it.

<Content>Not such a good hotel I just got back from seven days at the Caribe Hilton. The grounds are beautiful, the pools are nice and the service was good. We booked the vacation package through Liberty Travel and was surprised that when we got to the hotel that the buffet breakfast and one drink was free to us.Now for the not so nice things about the hotel. One day we were out for several hours sightseeing in Old San Juan. When we got back to our hotel room our door was open. It was not wide open, but open enough for anybody to walk it. I called the front desk and they said that the maid must have left it open and to check to see if anything was missing. Luckily nothing was missing. But that gave me an eerie feeling. Anybody could have just walked in and stolen everything. We did keep our valuables in the safe though.Another thing deals with the shower. We had a separate shower stall in the bathroom. The drain was really clogged to the point where none of the water was draining down. When my niece opened the shower door all the water came crashing out of the shower onto the floor as well as the carpet outside of the bathroom. We went to the front desk to report it and they said that they would have someone to look at it that night. Since we were going out that night we asked if someone could come the next day. The person at the front desk assured me that someone would be there first thing in the morning. When no one showed up by noon we called the front desk. Apparently someone put down that it was already fixed. They did send someone to fix it though. Someone from housekeeping was supposed to dry out the carpet, but the day we left the carpet was still wet. So much for that.The nightlife in the hotel stinks. There really is nothing for you to do and going to Old San Juan every evening gets stale after a while. The hotel had this woman singing at night in their bar. At first we thought it was Kareokee night her singing was that bad.If you want to do nothing at night I recommend this hotel. On the weekends it seems that local comes to the hotel to stay. It gets rather noisy in the pool area.Also, I might add, the sand on the beach is dirty with cigerette butts and other things that people just throw on the ground. It isn't very well kept up. If they spend less money on the grass outside of the hotel and more money on renovating the place it wouldn't be such a bad hotel to stay in. We were in the Tower section. The bodega to get the bottled water and other things is not too far from where we were staying.I doubt that I would ever go back to PR, but if I do I will not stay at the Hilton.One more thing. If you go to the Conserge to ask for places to eat or menus beware of a place called Bon Appetite. It is a service that will get you any kind of food you would like and deliver it to you. My niece and I wanted Chinese food. We ordered three things and the total was over $50. The beef with broccoli was over $17. Don't use this service if you can help it. We wound up ordering Domino's pizza instead.I hope this helps someone. If you have any questions you can email me at schills1@aol.com

<Content>Suggestion for finding a Good Rate Suggestion: After much research and contemplation between the Caribe Hilton, Intercontinental, and Wyndham Condado hotels, I booked the Caribe Hilton on Hotwire.com for Labor Day weekend. Saved $175.00 per 3-night stay compared with rates found elsewhere. Secured a $102.00 nightly rate plus taxes. It's a good deal, however, a bit of a crap-shoot--there's a chance that you 'll end up in either the Hilton, Wyndham, or Intercontinental. If you'll be happy at any of the three, which we were, check out Hotwire. Just you do your homework, pick a place in a four- or five-star rating, and you can usually figure out where you'll be staying. Hotwire is a role of the dice, but not entirely surprising, for certain destinations. We were betting on the Caribe Hilton, and got it. Happy travels!

<Content>Nice..good for families. I enjoyed my stay at the Caribe Hilton. I was almost going to stay at the Wyndham in Condado because they offer their guaranteed best prices online but when I went to confirm the res. the next day the inexpensive price was then gone. In any case, I was also told Caribe Hilton guaranteed their best prices online so I went for it. The hotel is nice when you enter. The grounds, pool and beach area all open up one after the other and are well maintained. However, the pool after the week staying there was dirty (dirty suds of some sort??). At the play ground with my seven year old daughter I found a what seemed like a used condom at which point I immidiately called my daughter to get off of the playset. People, get a room, your at a hotel! The rooms were ok. The fact that there was a private beach was nice but I enjoyed other beaches much better (ie. Isabella Beach was beautiful, Condado Beach was also nice). You have to go to Old San Juan. I was discouraged not to because it was more happening in the Condado area but I found Old San Juan so charming. They have really good restaurants like the Parrott Club  Tantra and bars like Dragonfly. That whole strip was filled with nice places to eat and very romantic. Since I am a parent the best thing is that Caribe Hilton gives you free baby sitting service when you stay three nights or more. I am not absolutely sure if this was a special or if its something they contine to do all the time but it was GREAT. I got alone time with my husband and we went out for dinner and dancing in Old San Juan. They have activities all day for youngsters and adults. There is also day time feeding for the fish which was amazing. We held onto some of the bread they give you to feed the fish at night and it was great! You must go to Culebra!! This place is AMAZING!! Its an island off of the main island like Vieques is. The beach is unreal...it looked fake it was so beautiful! You can take a ferry or charter from Fajardo to either Island. Keep that on your itin for sure! The main islanders are just catching on to this island too (surprisingly) and its a gem for sure. Depending on a full moon you can do Bio tours in Vieques or in Fajardo and this beyond ANYTHING is something you must do. Besides that, the hotel itself was worth the money, I paid $140 a night and was overall happy with my stay. My husband, daughter and I still have fond memories. Mortan's Steak house was part of the hotel which was a BIG plus. Cabs and bus service are esaily accesable (as is the car rental service if you decide last min but you should do it online). Good luck, be safe and happy times always!

<Content>You can do better for the $! I was surprised that a hotel with the Hilton name, and with these prices, was so lackluster. I definitely think you could do better elsewhere. There are two major concerns:1. OLD FACILTIES WITH POOR UPKEEP. The main building, which I stayed in, dates back to the 1950's-- and you can really tell. Everything in my room had some little problem with it: two of the lamps didn't work, the door couldn't be closed without slamming it, the toilet didn't flush all the time, my key kept not working, and one of the elevators (there were only 2, for hundreds of rooms) was out of service frequently. Overall, none of these were huge issues, but it meant lots of little hassles, that added up to not as pleasant of a vacation! I think poor housekeeping, as some other writers have suggested, was probably also part of this issue. For instance, the small red (dryclean-only-type) decorative pillows they thoughtfully placed on the bed had suspicious whitish stains on them. All I could think was, yuck! 2. There is noisy construction right next door! (as of June 2004). On whole side of the hotel (the side facing the historic small fort) now overlooks a concrete-and-iron, half-finished, condo building, with bright yellow porta-potties decoratively placed right on the beach waterline, where your eye is naturally drawn. I guess in the past this must have been an attractive water-and-greenery view, so people who stayed here in the past probably had a better experience. The construction noise wasn't really that loud, but it was constant--7 days a week including Sunday, and starting early in the morning. I really didn't end up using the balcony because of this issue. (of no view plus noise) Overall, again, this wasn't a huge issue but it did detract from the overall experience. Overall, the Frommer's guide makes this place sound much nicer than it is. I think I read there that it had one of the nicest beaches in the area--and while I didn't visit all the other beaches, I was really surprised that the Caribe beach was supposed to be a great beach. It was really very small and had lots of rocks once you got in the water. If you want to walk along an expansive beach you will just end up going out on the street to get to one of the public beaches (which, by the way, were perfectly nice!) Overall, my feeling is you could do better for the money. I would not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>The important things. Our 5 day stay at the Caribe Hilton was overall great. The only complaint that we had was the housekeeping, they didn't pay much attention to details. The night we checked into the hotel, there was a dirty diaper in the bathroom, the toilet seat was 'wet', there was hair in the shower and the hallways could have used some vacuuming. We complained about this the following morning and the hotel manager offered us a garden suite. We went to see the suite but decided that our 13th floor room, which was newly renovated, was much better for us even though smaller. The manager offered us another room on the 16th floor, which was identical to ours, but still the trouble of moving three floors was not going to gain us anything especially having a small child with us. So the manager gave us a $75.00 credit at the Palmera's restaurant. That was very nice!There is one aspect of our visit at the Hilton that left a lasting impression and that was guest relations. The night we arrived one of our friends felt sick and was about to pass out (diet issues), and right away one of the hotel staff saw that we were having problems and called for security. The security personnel dressed in a suit arrived with a first aid kit and oxygen. They also phoned for a doctor (which by the way will charge $120.00) but we had them cancel the doctor after our friend was feeling better after drinking a soda. Two days later another friend of ours was swimming with me out at the reef barrier when he stepped on a sea urchin which stung him in nine different places on his foot. We swam back to shore and my wife approached one of the hotel staff members who was sweeping the sidewalk and told him that our friend had been stung by something in the water. He immediately dropped the broom and literally ran to get help from the lifeguard. The lifeguard arrived with a first aid kit and after examining the foot sting, he recommend that my friend go to the hospital and have the 'splinters' removed. The Hilton security gave us a ride to the local hospital. After we were done I phoned the hotel and they picked us up and drove us back to the hotel. One more incident happened, the in-room safe code had been re-programmed accidentally. Again I called security and they attend us in a very quick and professional manner.After the incidents we went through, the housekeeping problems became minor issues. I was very impressed with the guest relations and the security personnel. Again they were all well dressed and tended to us in a very professional and prompt manner. This gave me a good sense of well being for my family and me, which is far more important than 'cosmetic' issues. I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would consider staying there again.

<Content>Overall wonderful experience! Just returned from a great 5 day stay at the Caribe Hilton with a group of friends. The newly renovated (13/14th floor) ocean view rooms were lovely with great shower/bath, small balcony and wonderful beds. Via the Puerto Rico is Fun promotion, we had a wonderful buffet breakfast and one drink per day included in our room price, and 4th night free... a great and relaxing plus. Buffet was great, with huge fresh selection. The beach was clean, chairs plentiful and never excessively crowded- free umbrellas too. All the staff we encountered were very helpful and the concierge gave exceptional recommendations for dinner in old San Juan! The only drawbacks: some members of our party had to wait for their room on check-in, and one day our room was not made up (it was done later when we called to ask), and the view of the hotel being constructed next door from some of the rooms is disappointing (though not noisy at all from the upper tower floors); the on-site restaurants are convenient but seem overpriced and uninteresting compared to the similarly or lower-priced and more inventive food available in San Juan, just a short cab ride away. Great experience.

<Content>Not bad Spent a week there on business. The staff was friendly and responsive. Rooms reminded me of kinda upscale Holiday Inn (if that is possible) but in need of some sprucing up. Bed was comfortable and room was kept clean by housekeeping staff. The food at the restuarants was acceptable but nothing to rave about. The best thing about the place is the grounds whch are very well-kept and visually appealing. The pools and beach are inviting. All things considered, not a bad place to stay. A good palce for kids. Be sure to get out of the hotel. You can ride a bus downtown for 25 cents. They are safe and pretty quick. There is a pretty good but very informal restuarant within walking distance (about a block), behind the nearby soccer stadium, called Escambron, that does good things with plantains. PR is hot in June (and July, August, and September).

<Content>Great Experience My wife  I just returned from a 6 day stay at the Caribe Hilton  I can't say enough about the great service we had there. The front desk, maids, service personnel and the staff at the Hilton Honors room were fabulous. The young conceirge was very helpful in regards to recommendations for restaurants, geographic directions, events, etc. I was apprehensive about staying there due to several negative reviews on this web site but our experiences were fantastic. Also, we were staying on a complimentary basis due to our Hilton membership. The property is fabulous given the amount of prime beach front property that they have and numerous restaurants on site. We did not avail ourselves of the restaurants as they were expensive and too Americanized, i.e., Mortons. The best experiences that we had were the interaction with the people in San Juan. Without a doubt, the friendliest people my wife and I encountered on our numerous travels. We will return soon!!

<Content>Best Trip Ever From the minute we arrived at the caribe hilton til the minute we left my girlfriend and I were treated like a king and queen. I was a little worried because of some bad reviews but when we saw our room we were very pleased. The people that write the horrible reviews are often stuck up and usually never happy anyway. The restaurants are pricey but good at the hotel. I would suggest getting out on the town and trying the local food. The hotel grounds were very clean and the private beach was so quiet and relaxing. The best part of the trip was the catamaran. That was so nice to be out on the water snorkeling and to see all the underwater life. If you go to the bar downstairs tell jose I said hi, what a great guy..

<Content>8 day stay at the Caribe Hilton 6/11/04 - 6/19/04 My wife and I just recently returned from the Caribe Hilton. We liked the private ocean front beach, that you can snorkle in (but buy snokle gear as the resort charges $10/hour). Cheap snokle gear costs about $10 at Walgreens or similar. The food at the hotel is fine, but overpriced. It's a resort afterall, and with their downtown location a little ways from other hotels and restaurants, they can afford to charge what they charge. For breakfast, go to the Normandie Hotel, which is about 50 yards from the Caribe Hilton. Their buffet breakfast is $12.95 vs. $18.95 at the Hilton. While the Caribe offers more food choices, the restaurant is fly infested and makes the food less than delectable (it's an open air/open door to the outside restaurant, but still flys are a problem.). For lunch, get a sandwich at the outdoor pool bar area. Burgers and sandwiches are still pricey, but not bad ($7 burger and fries). For dinner, take a taxi to the Marriott in Condado. It's $8 each way, but around the Marriott on Ashford St are many local restaurants and a few national chains (chili's, starbucks, dunkin doughnuts.). I recommend the restaurant Hermes (out the Marriott and take a right, about 75-100 yards down on the left. Excellent steak, fish and Mofongo (a local dish served with chicken or shrimp). Say hello to Alexandria, a beautiful young lady who works there as a server, but doesn't speaks decent English. The prices are great. $17 for Filet Mignon vs. $35 for the same steak at Mortons at the Caribe Hilton. The Marrriott also has a nice casino, if your into that. Afterwards, take a taxi from the Marriott back to the Caribe Hilton. Why not stay at the Marriott? Small pools, and public beach, which gets crowded with locals on the weekends. If you want to see the Rain Forest (El Yuque) or other very nice beaches in Puerto Rico, contact Jason in Guest Services at the hotel. He did a great job of getting us on a great tour to see Bacardi, El Yuque and the Bioluminescent Bay(which is really cool). Take a taxi to Old San Juan (El Moro) and take the tour, it's $5. Taxi $10. Then walk downtown. I wouldn't go out and about old San Juan at night, but that's me. During the day its fine, but stay on the roads with the shops (mostly around the Convento Hotel, where you would also need to get a return taxi from. ) Taxi's seem to be only available at Hotels, so it's not like NYC or Chicago where you just hail one on the street as it passes by.There is a general store across the street from the Caribe Hilton. Cokes are $.75 and they have chips, beer, rum, wine, etc. Our room was in the Tower and was recently updated. We saw other rooms that were recently updated. Overall, service in PR is not as fast as in the states, but you're on vacation, slow down and enjoy it. Beer and mix drinks are expensive at all hotels. E-mail me if you need any additional information. Hope this helps.

<Content>The worst service and attitude What an absolute disappointment. Not only was the food below standard but the rudeness on behalf of the hotel staff was unbelievable. If you're not a local expect to get blown off or at the very least expect your food to come last. It was very apparent that if you're from the area you will end up with the best service and the best room, if you're not, good luck you're on your own. They'll move quick when it comes to taking your gratuity but good luck in locating them after that.BTW, I love how they donate a $1 a day to a kids charity program for each guest that stays. I thought this was very kind until I found that I was charged each day on my bill for it. I certainly don't mind donating but for this hotel to act as though their the ones making the donation and then charging you is ridiculous. These people need to get off their --- and learn a few things about customer service - I will not be returning to this slime hotel.

<Content>mixed bag A mixed review for this hotel:the free food for children under 5 is a bonus, although the cost of the food for adults somewhat mitigates this blessing. There is a good child vacation camp for kids 4-12. The pools and grounds are fantastic and there is a playground as well. The beach is ok if not fabulous. There are peacocks and swans in the gardens. Free internet access in the lobby. There is free bfast in the HH lounge on the 2nd floor and a happy hour everyday. On the minus side: rooms in main building are a little shabby (tolerable though); the staff frequently bristles when requests are made; the place lacks charm and the general impression is so-so.

<Content>Dissappointed party We make reservations for a room for 4, with full view of the sea and nice room. Our room in the 10th floor was in front of the parking entrance and in front of under going construction, the room was old, with rusty bathroom and rusty air condition vents. It us 3 days to move to another room ( opposite site ) but the same conditions in the room.The beach was great but many locals were going to the beach (supposed to be private) but without being stopped, so it was crowded at the beach. The sites were great and food was very good but expensive.Rent a car is easy to get around.

<Content>excellent My husband and I stayed a week at the Caribe Hilton last February. I am very picky about the quality of hotel where I spend my free time. This hotel had everything - people were friendly, the pool area was beautiful and most of all we loved our room where we spent allot of time sitting on our balcony. We definitely will go there again.

<Content>Caribe Hilton....Great! Just returned from one week at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan, PR. I was concerned due to the reviews I had read at this site, but I didn't need to be. The staff was great, responsive, available. The rooms were clean (we stayed in the tower). There was some construction to the lagoon side, our view, but not annoying. The bathroom was not perfect, but a few little things could be overlooked. My bed was so comfortable, I didn't want to get out. The beach is private, nice. Great spa. All of our meals were out of the hotel, good to just eat the local food, The Puerto Rico Cafe off of Fortaleza St in Old San Juan is a good experience, as well as Aguaviva, near plaza Colon. Enjoy the people and the history.

<Content>was disappointed We were not happy upon checking into the hotel, we were told that our room was given away, even though it had been paid in full, plus was informed of late check in guarantee. We ended up sleeping in part of a suite on a double sleeper sofa. So spent extra time having to unpack for one night, then check into another room the next day. We had reservations for two nights. They need to do a few repairs in the rooms we stayed in. We assumed the name was very reputable so went ahead  booked yet another night for our return from a cruise before we left home. Hopefully others found their stay to be nicer.

<Content>Caribe Hilton was great! Like others here, when we read all of the reviews we were a little afraid of staying here. We used Hilton points to stay for free, so we assumed we would receive the lowest category room. When we were checking in, I mentioned that it was our 22nd Wedding Anniversary (and they had a corsage that I had ordered via 1-800-flowers which their Conceirge had recommended). They gave us a room in the main building (not tower). It had a great view, nice furnishings, red marble counter top in bath and comfortable bed and small balcony which had ocean view out the side.We also ate at Morton's steak house, which while expensive (and all Morton's are), was great for our Anniversary. The staff at the front desk were extremely friendly and nice, and so were the bellmen. We also stayed one day after our 7-day cruise so we had two stays. Again, staff was great and room in main tower was also fine. Don't be afraid to go there!

<Content>I remember when It was 1963, I was recently married. Took my wife to the Caribe Hilton and stayed in a cabana. Remember the air conditioning didn't work well....probably fixed by now.....Went for dinner in the Caribe #1 restaurant........ordered expensive meals, way beyond our limited budget....the food arrived, beautiful in it's presentation and aroma, my young wife grew pale and said  I have to throw up the first sign that she was pregnant with our first of 5 children.......I often think of the Caribe and how good that dinner would have tasted.........

<Content>Happy Honeymooners! I was very nervous about staying at the Caribe Hilton after reading many of the reviews posted on the web. Therefore, I sent an e-mail to Hilton telling them my concerns and letting them know that this would be the first night of our honeymoon prior to our cruise. My first e-mail went without a response, so after about a week or two I simply copied the e-mail, re-sent  asked for a reply. Within 24 hours I had a response from Reservations letting me know that the Front Desk assigned for us one of the recently renovated rooms in the tower which had an ocean view  that the bathrooms were completely redone. Still, I was nervous because of a previous review where the same was promised but the Front Desk gave their room to someone with a similar name. When we arrived at the Front Desk, they were very nice  even mentioned that they knew we were Honeymooners, so evidently my e-mail reached the Front Desk. Our room was awesome!!! It was totally remodeled with new furnishings, carpet, etc., the bathroom was gorgeous, the shower was excellent  the ocean view even better! We ate dinner in their Italian restaurant where the food  service was outstanding. When we got back to our room, they had a sent a bottle of champagne  a box of truffles up to our room! I would definitely go back! Since we were only staying one night, I was afraid that they really wouldn't be concerned with whether or not we liked our accommodations. I am pleased to say that the opposite occurred!

<Content>What a blast!!!! oooooo My god....did I have a blast!!! I decided to take a mini weekend getaway with one of my best friends and we decided on CARIBE HILTON what a great choice. I was there from April 23 till April 26. The sites are awesome........you are so close to old san juan. The concierge is so helpful. I really do Love Puerto Rico and found that this mini vacation was the best thing I have ever done. Caribe Hilton made my weekend. I have the coolest tan...lol thank you so much for the 3 level pools and the private beach....what a delight. I can't wait to book my summer vacation at Caribe Hilton.............

<Content>Great stay, food exceptional Hilton was great. I had the opportubity to stay at 3 other hotels and the Hilton was the best at accomodations. The hotel staff was also very pleasant and basically bent over backwards when asked.The place was beautifully decorated-The ocean view was also great-The pool was very nice and the room service was exceptional.We will definately stay at the Hilton-Caribe again.

<Content>Had a great time! My friends and I had a great time at our stay at the Caribe Hilton. Minus the broken safe and vanity door hinge, the room was great - clean and comfortable. The grounds, where we spent most of our time, were great. It's rainy season now (May) so there were some scattered showers here and there, however our time there was still wonderful. We too experienced the taxi strike, leaving us stranded at the hotel in the evenings. There is a public bus that takes you to Old San Juan or to the Candado area, however we did not feel comfortable taking this at night; instead we took day trips to outside areas. There is enterainment on the weekends at the bar which was fun. The food at the hotel was decent. I read some previous recommendations about cheap food at the little bodega across from the hotel -- it is cheap, but not very good. The pool bar and grill was very good, as well as the smoothies at the Olas Sap. All in all, we had a great time -- great location, great beaches and friendly staff.

<Content>Good value if you use Priceline This hotel was built in 1950. So, the architecture is dated and the amenities are a bit tired. It is set up for business conventions, but has a huge outdoor pool facility with hot tubs. In addition, the dining facilities look out over the pool area to the ocean through 2-story high windows set in a panoramic semi-circle. Be warned: there is construction going on next door, which starts at 7 a.m. on weekdays. Noisy in the morning, but not as bad as Shanghai.The key for me was getting a price of $75 a night on priceline! At this price, I will suffer tired plumbing and carpets. When I arrived at the airport, we learned that there was a taxi strike. The hotel sent a van to pick us up. When I checked in, they searched for a room and upgraded me to a garden suite (huge living room in addition to king-sized bed). Downside: The large picture window in the living room looks directly into the new high-rise going up next door (50 ft away). I do not care, as I wake up at 6 a.m. and use the pool, which is on the other side of the hotel - away from the construction.There is no in-room high-speed internet, but there is a wireless service available in the lobby (I am using it now). I could not use my ATT dial-up in San Juan.Summary: I am paying $375 for 5 nights in an ancient, but acceptable, business/resort hotel, where the employees give it a good go. I get what I need, by asking around, and enjoy the sun-filled pool and beach area. Ignore the business conferences and eat in town...sheesh. I would not pay $150 a night to stay here, though, but at $75, I see this as a bit of an adventure in paradise.

<Content>Fantastic for kids! We just returned from the Caribe Hilton on 4/24. I was a bit apprehensive considering some of the other reviews but we were thrilled once we got there. The view from the pool and beach area is spectacular. The room was very clean and comfortable. The food was expensive but not out of line with other hotel restaurants that I've gone to. It was very good, especially the Italian restaurant on site. Our kids loved it. They have a nice kiddy pool, the beach is very safe for them, they have two playground areas and a game room for the occasional afternoon rain shower. They have lots of beach buckets and shovels for kids to use and also rent rafts, snorkel equipment, etc. The staff was very nice to the kids as well. It was very conveniently located as well, we took taxis everywhere instead of renting a car. The tour desk has outings to almost all of the places you'd want to go. I highly recommend taking a tour to the El Yunque rainforest. My 6 year old son refused to say good bye, because he wants to go back. We agree with him.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay Just returned last night from an 8 night stay at the Caribe. We were a littel nervous after reading some of the reviews, so we were prepared for the worst. Our room on the 4th floor of the tower building was nothing spectacular, but clean and comfortable. The view was terrible (construction site and parking garage) but we do not spend enough time in the room to care about the view. Room had a slight smoke smell although it was supposed to be non smoking. Bed and bathroom were clean and comfortable, though not at all fancy. However, what the room lacked was made up for with the grounds. The pool and beach area are well kept and there are plenty of chairs and clean towels. We found the staff to be friendly enough, though we did not purchase any meals or drinks there because they are quite expensive. Go to the little store across the street for a cheap, good breakfast. This hotel is very busy with lots of conferences and conventions. The lobby is always bustling with people checking in and out, as well as walking around the shops (pricey) and music at the bar. We did not have any problems at check in or check out, though we did not have any charges to our room to take care of. We did the El Yunque rainforest tour from the hotel which was worth the $45 per person.You can walk to Condado but Old San Juan is more easily accessed by bus for .25. Another nice thing about the Caribe is the garden/bird sanctuary and the parrots in the lobby (Koko and Pancho). We had a few rainy moments and it was nice to go watch the peacocks and swans when we were not out at the pool. Very pretty scenery at this hotel. We would stay there again. Email me if you want any more info.

<Content>loved the pools We just returned from Puerto Rico April 19th. We loved the pools and the outside areas of the hotel but the room was seriously lacking - in definate need of updating. Our ocean view room was just a sliver- mostly a view of the construction of the new hotel. Lots of leaks in the bathroom and a very slow drain in the bathtub-nothing seriously bad but enough to mention. Also very high prices for drinks at the bars ($8.00 margaritas  $3.00 pops)

<Content>Heaven on Earth ! We just got back from our second stay at the Caribe, and already want to go back. We requested the same room as last year and were happily surprised when we got it! The service is great and all the staff are so friendly. Don't forget to visit the boys, Rodney, Saul, Angel and Hyram at the pool bar... We love them! They even remembered us from last year. What a great time! The Caribe Hilton is our little piece of Heaven on Earth. You'll want to keep coming back.

<Content>A Nice Surprise I read many of the reviews of the Caribe Hilton, and was worried that I had made the wrong decision. When we arrived on April 11, 2004 and saw how beautiful the open air lobby and lounge were, I knew that everything would be just fine. The hotel pool and beach area are well manicured and very clean. The staff is unbelievably friendly and accomodating. The room was neat and clean. The view from our balcony was wonderful. The bathroom could have been a little more modern and needed a facelift but when you go on vacation do you really want to spend all that much time in your room and bathroom? (Stay home if the answer is yes). The restaruants were terriffic, fast friendly service with delicious well presented fresh foods. I would stay at the Caribe Hilton again....

<Content>Great hotel Just returned April 9 pleasantly surprised after reading some of the other reviews. Hotel staff beginning with Dominic at the front desk to Hiriam and Rodney at the swim up bar, were helpful, friendly and entertaining. Our room in the tower was a little small for two double beds but very clean and updated. The view alone is worth the visit! Restaurants and cocktails are a little pricey but no worse than other islands I've visited. Oh and the spa...if you can fit it in do so, the perfect end to a great island vacation.

<Content>Request a Tower Room We just returned from a wonderful stay ay the Caribe Hilton. We got in late on a Saturday night, so our first room was not exactly what we expected. Like everyone else, we requested an ocean view, but we were put into the Garden wing on the fifth floor.The room itself was clean and comfortable, and it overloooked a lush garden with peacocks and swans. The sound of the coquis was magical. However, it also was right next to the construction site of their expansion and new casino. The next day, after several conversations with the front desk staff, who were all very helpful and friendly, we were moved to the 16th floor of the tower. This is the newest section, so the room was immaculate, the bathroom had a corner shower with a rainfall showerhead and a handheld one. Our room was always clean and neat when we returned from the pool. The pool, beach and health club are clean and beautiful. We were there during a busy week, but we never felt crowded at the pool...lots of lounge chairs and towels. There was no entertainment except for kareoke which was pretty lame, but up the street there is a piano bar with a talented singer named Roger. Go around the corner to the little deli for cheap good food. We enjoyed our vacation.

<Content>Loved the Caribe Hilton We stayed at the Caribe Hilton March 8-14  were very pleased. We had a great room on the 7th floor overlooking the pools, beach  ocean. We have traveled in Europe  the US  found the Caribe to be on a par with Hilton Hotels elsewhere. We appreciated check in  out in the Diamond Honors Lounge on the 9th floor, no waiting. The continental breakfast there was good  the food plentiful. We ate several meals at Palmeras, both buffet  off the menu, enjoyed the food. My 5 year old granddaughter ate free at the buffet. The pool snack bar  bar were very convienient for meals while at the pool or beach. The turn down service ensured we had dry towels after showers after the beach  pool. We had dinner one night at Mortons, I have eaten at Mortons in Phoenix,  the Caribe Mortons was just as nice  the food comparable. Reading the negative comments make me wonder if we were in the same hotel. Has anyone who was unhappy contacted Hilton corporate to voice their dissatifcation?

<Content>Rooms need to be renovated ASAP My husband and I just came back from San Juan and we stayed at the Caribe Hilton. Our room was terrible. The worst ever. There was a hole on the wall, the carpet was dirty, and the balcony door was broken. After talking to the manager several times (they kept telling us they were full), we were sent to another room, which was not that great but at least it was clean. But the hotel itself is not bad. It is not a four star hotel, but the pool/beach area is the best. Beautiful!!! Except for the front desk employees, everybody was very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge. They were very efficient and nice.

<Content>Worst hotel I have ever visited The first thing to note about this hotel is that it is not a tourist hotel. I assume that it functions principally as a business hotel (though I doubt it functions effectively at all). The reason that I am pointing out the misrepresentation in the classification is because we relied on the hotel's characterization as a resort when we made our vacation plans. I think the first clues to the low level of service at this hotel were the phone calls that I made prior to my arrival to find out about services and amenities. I am convinced that the hotel staff members moonlight as prison guards in a maximum security facility. Their responses range between rude and hostile. When we checked in, the front desk personnel didn't inform us of any of the hotel's offerings. She started to put us into a room in a lower category than what we reserved. If my wife hadn't specifically inquired, that would have been something that we would have had to correct after we got to our room. Even when we got our room (after the correction), it looked out over a building top that led to a big construction project. It would seem that you would reserve the lousy rooms for those times when you're straining against capacity. Now, on to the next issue: the food. I think the food and beverage staff must go dumpster diving at the other hotels to make their menus. The food was horrible! the couple of things that we ordered we inedible, and we had to give up any prospect of having decent food here. We did eat breakfast at the buffet, because it was included in our package. The buffet was the least cared-for presentation of food that I have seen in a long time. The shoddy restocking of the food items made the entire thing look like last call at a soup kitchen. And, if the poor food presentation wasn't enough to engender your displeasure, they also made sure that they didn't clean the tables between diners. Next issue: the room. Our room had this weird wood paneling that gave the effect of a low budget porno set. There was nothing appealing about the room at all. You could find a more appealing room in practically any budget hotel anywhere. I could go on and on, but you get the point...Don't ever stay here!!!! We checked out early and went to a completely different part of PR.

<Content>A very nice place to stay I have read many mixed reviews on the Caribe Hilton and every experience is individual and subjective but our experience was great. The hotel was beautiful and the staff friendly and attentive. We were in a rennovated room so we did not experience the complaints about old and musty rooms. We had a beautiful view and the room was always spotless. A nice touch is early evening towel service. After a day at the beach and everyone taking showers the bathroom was a mess with wet towels hanging everywhere. It was nice to come back from dinner and find fresh towels and the bathroom cleaned.We visited several hotels while we were in San Juan and we felt the Caribe Hilton had the friendliest atmosphere. The private beach and beautiful pools really make for a great fun-in-the-sun time. I would recommend the Caribe Hilton to any of my friends visiting San Juan.A lot has been written about the cost of food at the Caribe Hilton but I feel the problem is not with the cost of the food but with unrealistic expectations of visitors. The food is no more expensive that what you would pay if you ate at a Hilton in Chicago, Dallas, LA or NY. If you eat at a top-tier hotel anywhere in the world it is going to cost you more due to their overhead. That is just the facts. I have read several complaints about the cost of Mortons. I wonder if the people complaining have ever eaten at a Mortons. I have eaten at one in Dallas and in Chicago and the prices are just about the same. If you eat at a premium steak house it is going to be expensive. Room service is the best deal. They give you a lot of food and the quality is very good. Once again it is not cheap but not out of line. People have to remember that they are staying at a resort Hilton and not at a Motel 6.All-in-all I would highly recommend the Caribe Hilton and if we visit San Juan again it is where I will stay.

<Content>Really Enjoyed the Hilton! My boyfriend and I recently spent 4 nights at the Caribe Hilton and really enjoyed the resort. The grounds were beautiful and well kept and everyone who worked there was friendly. While the beach has some sort of reef (way off shore) that prevents waves from hitting the shore, the water is warm, clear and refreshing. The huge pool area with its swim-up bar was perfect, especially with the view of the Atlantic right behind it. Also, the outside restaurant, Atlantis, was great for lunch and snacks. The other restaurants were overpriced but we prefered to eat away from the hotel anyway. At night, the bar inside had entertainment and dancing; nice to relax before or after dinner in Old San Juan. OSJ is less then 10 minutes from the Hilton and is about a $7-8 cab fare. Lastly, our room was clean and good-sized, with a view of the ocean. We enjoyed the little patio off our room as well. All in all, given the hotel's proximity to OSJ, its beautiful landscape and its catering to ultimate relaxation, we would stay there again.

<Content>Don't believe the negative reviews Two friends and I went to PR this March. Immediately after we confirmed our reservation we discovered the trip advisor website. Needless to say, we were a bit nervous because many of the review were awful. Despite our apprehension we decided to take the risk and lodge at the Caribe Hilton. I am glad we did so. The accommodations were just fine. Our room was cozy and clean. The staff was helpful and the hotel's amenities were wonderful. I would stay at Caribe Hilton a second time. I am not sure why so many people are inclined to write negative reviews about this hotel. But my experience was a pleasant one.

<Content>Enjoyed the Caribe Hilton We stayed at the Caribe Hilton on March 19 and 20. It has a lot of pluses--nice little beach, lovely swimming pool and large comfortable rooms. My kids loved the game room. It's a healthy hike to Old San Juan, but it's a beautiful walk along the ocean. Some problems--one of the two tower elevators gave out while we were there and the water went off on our last day. But on the whole we enjoyed the stay and would recommend the Caribe Hilton to anyone who wants to stay in San Juan.

<Content>Shame on Hilton!! We stayed at this facility for four days on a Honors members vacation. To say it was disappointing doesn't scratch the surface. Rooms are old and tired. We were promised an ocean view room only to arrive and find we had a room with a terrific view of the construction area (which woke us up every morning including Saturday). The Honors members club is disgraceful, tired and worn similar to rooms. On arrival at 3:30 pm our room wasn't ready (HHonors member) and the associate at the HHonors desk was miserable and only wanting to shuffle and sign without giving a reasonable explanation to the amenties on there property. I've stayed in a lot of Hiltons and this would be the last one I'd put my most valued customer up in for there points vacation. San Juan is beautiful and was a great place to vacation, to bad this hotel doesn't live up to the same billing. Cannot recommend.

<Content>Terrible: The worst Hilton and definitely the worst hotel in this price range My husband and I were attending a professional conference in San Juan in March 15-19, 2004 and the conference was in Hilton. Before leaving, I had read the overwhelmingly negative reviews, but this was our first time in San Juan and we were not sure whether we would be comfortable commuting between Hilton and other hotels on the island, given the island's crime rate. That was a huge mistake, this hotel should'nt be a Hilton or be rated as a Deluxe or 4 star property. The rooms were moldy, with dirty carpets, dirty walls and an awful bathroom which ran the danger of overflowing anytime. Our room was in the garden wing, when at first we complained the guy at the front desk Dominic, told us very rudely that since we only paid $179 the deluxe rooms were not available to us. This was the conference rate and never said anything about inferior rooms, and we later found out that quite a few people attending the same conference and paying the same rate had rooms in the tower. After repeated complains, on our third day Greten at the front desk gave us another room with much better view in the main bldg but that was smaller and even more moldy. The front desk was extremelt rude and unfriendly and we got the worst behavior because we resembled the island look. My son has asthma and the moldy room was bothering him so much that we spent most of our time outdoors but repeated requests didnt get us a renovated room. It was nothing but an overpriced junk. I should have known better, from the reviews here, and also from my experience with other Hiltons, they are rude and noncooperative whereas others like Embassy suites in their group are so much better in trying to help you. I understand that sometimes it is not possible to switch you but two years back when we faced this king of situation in a Doubletree in Seattle with the carpet moldy and all, they shampood the carpet and sprayed the room, didnt solve the problem entirely but their effort was noteworthy. My recommendation will be to stay at Marriott in the condado area. Also that sandpit that they called a beach is disgraceful. I dont know how they can call themselves a resort....it's nothing like the Hilton Hawaiian Villages which are resorts, a few peacocks and swans sont make a n old unclean property a resort. My suggestion to the Managerment would be to take a trip to Riviera Maya and see some ot the true resorts.

<Content>Great time!!! I stayed at Caribe Hilton from 03/22/04 to 03/37/04 it was my spring break trip with my boyfriend. I purchased the trip on Hotwire for $687 per person for flight and hotel from Chicago. I ended up spending about $1,100 per person because the food was so expensiveI thought it was a great deal and I didn't get treated worse or got a worse room then anyone else that payed full price. My room was 762 and it wasn't bad at all. The staff at the front desk, Mortons stake house, bar and grill place were very nice. The staff at the Ilatian and Spanish restaurant were ok not kind just seemed boring. The food is over priced. Do not go to Mortons steak house unless you are willing to spend about $90 for two people to eat dinner. Save money and go to the grill by the pool or to the Palmeras restaurant. This hotel loves to charge people for everything so be careful because I was charged for consuming drinks and food that are in the room when I didn't even touch the stuff. But when I told them about it they kindly took the charges off. Also if you want to buy something to drink or some chips to eat go to this little store that is right outside the hotel they sell suff for about half the price the hotel sells it for. The pool and the beach are very nice. The room was a little worn like other reviews said but I didn't care because I was never in the room and the only time I was I was sleeping. They offer snorkeling trips at the hotel I recomend going on the east wind which was $73pp and the cheapest one offered it was a lot of fun. They also have two parrets by the name of Koko and Pancho. Koko loves girls and is a sweaty, Pancho is a thief and will steal or break your watch if your wearing one. He broke mine and bit me. I had a great time and would go back someday.

<Content>Total Waste! I was at the Caribe Hilton 3/17 to what should have been the 21st. Not only did they not have the last day reserved but I got a single bed for FOUR people! They completely messed up the reservation. They did nothing to accomodate me. Who pays to go on vacation and sleeps on a roller bed? The air conditioning was broken leaving the room freezing cold (the roller beds did not come with blankets, only a sheet)! I was stuck there during a convention that overtook the whole hotel. Needless to say I checked out early and went to the Mariott which made me feel like a star.

<Content>We thought it was great The grounds and pool areas were the highlight. Our room was clean, spacious and had a great view (it helped to be on the ninth floor - lower floors do not have the same view). The staff was very friendly and seemed to appreciate that we were there but not particularly fast (not unusual in PR). The low-light was the food. Unfortunately the food was very overpriced for the quality. We would stay there again.

<Content>Wouldn't Stay There Again I didn't believe the bad reviews until I stayed there. The hotel itself wasn't in bad shape. I would say it was pretty average. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived 3 hours after check-in time. The people who came along with us didn't even have a room even though we reserved our rooms at the same time. There was a view of the ocean, but also the neighboring construction. The hotel was secluded from the main strip by about a 20 minute walk. The staff at the front desk were unfriendly and unhelpful. The pool and beach area was beautiful however. And most restaurant staff we encountered were friendly and the food was good. We came in to a small lizard in our room one night. The balcony door was stuck. Overall, I was disappointed and would not stay there again.

<Content>Beautiful Property We stayed one night at the Caribe Hilton after our cruise on Feb. 28th. The property location is beautiful. The lobby is open air with a view of the ocean and pool. The staff was very helpful when we tried to check in very early after just getting off the cruise ship. They kept our luggage while we left the hotel and took a tour of Old San Juan. Our room was spacious with a king sized bed with a garden view. The property is showing a little age and weathering but overall very nice. I would recommend. Our experience was not bad at all.

<Content>Wonderful Stay! I thought the Caribe Hilton. Sure the rooms were the most modern, up to date, kept hotel rooms of all time, but I thought it was a nice Caribbean charm. After all, who's really in the room that long. When there's a beautiful pool and beach area outside being in the room is a waste of time. Although the meals were a bit expensive, they were excellent and large. Coming from Wisconsin, I had never seen a hotel without a door in the front! Staying at the Caribe Hilton was a wonderful experience for me!

<Content>Not a Four Star Hotel If you go to the Caribe Hilton expecting a 4 star hotel, you are going to be dissapointed. We were there the night of 3/14/2004. We arrived early from our cruise, I understand that the room was not ready. We got our room slightly afternoon, OK, but we requested a king and got two doubles. The room was on the 4th floor of the main building. The view was questionalbe, but liveable, but the room was run down, shabby. The main door looked like it had been torn down and nailed back together, the bath...old and dated, the furniture looked old and used hard. I requested another room, was given a room in the garden building, 5th floor, same beds set up, and other than the view the same run down shabby room, with the exception this time the AC did not work the humidity in the room was 100%, the toilet did not flush correctly and even the coffee pot was broken. We were too tired to keep dragging all of our stuff around so we just took what we got. The staff kept on telling us that they were too full to make any changes. The Honors club looks like it is an afterthought. Tucked away on a second floor alcove. The one lady there had trouble keeping even the bare minimums stocked. Let alone keeping the three tables clear. It was poorly staffed and did not seem clean. I do give them credit for maintaining their grounds nicely. The food at the pool was overpriced, $5.50 for a coors!! I would rate this hotel as a 2 star at best. Hampton Inns put this Hilton to shame.

<Content>Loved the Caribe Hilton Just returned from four great days at the Caribe Hilton. After reading some of the reviews here we were concerned, but all the trepidation was unwarranted. The facility is not brand new, but the pools and beach are fantastic. As are the on-site restaurants. There isn't much withing walking distance, but a taxi to Old San Juan is just $7 and well worth the trip--local flavor restaurants as well as Pizza Hut, Burger King, Subway, KFC, etc. If you are going to San Juan and want to sit on a clean, private beach (we had no trouble getting all the space we wanted on the Hilton's beach) or to relax in the sun by the pools, I can't imagine there is a better place in San Juan. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and our room was ready at 3:00. We will go back.

<Content>Disappointing We stayed at the Caribe Hilton for one night en route to the Virgin Islands for our honeymoon (June 2003). We redeemed Hilton HHonors points, so we got the room for free. It was my understanding that the normal rate was $200 per night, and I would have been very upset had I paid that much for the room. The view was great, but the room was run-down and dumpy, and kind of depressing. I am normally not very picky about hotels--the Hampton Inn is typically fine with me. But our room at the Caribe Hilton was very disappointing (and on the first night of our honeymoon, no less!) The hotel's redeeming quality is its pool and lobby. The pool and grounds are well-kept, and the beach is beautiful. There's a neat swim-up bar, and the lobby has big exotic birds. I guess I'm glad we went, but frankly San Juan was a disappointment as well. It is a poor, run down town. I've heard that the resorts and the Old Town area are nice, but from the airport to the Caribe Hilton, we didn't really see anything nice and were really glad to leave. Bottom line--don't pay more than $100 per night for this hotel, and if you do go, plan to spend most of your time at the pool.

<Content>Loved it all! Had a wonderful time at the El Caribe. Don't understand all the negative reviews, our room was clean and beautiful. Everyone connected with the hotel was pleasant and very accommodating. The conciegre, Jayson, arranged an anniversary dinner for us that was truly spectular and unforgetable. The only criticism I agree with is the Hilton Honors lounge -- that really was lame. Maybe if all travellers greeted everyone with a smile, they would get a smile in return. I can't fault the service and hotel personnel at all.

<Content>Fantastic Stay My wife and I just returned from our weekend at the Caribe. Excellent place to stay. My wife is a Hilton Diamond Member and we stayed on the conceirge floor. The welcome was great and the staff was always willing to help. The meals we ate were very good and the area is beautiful. About a thirty minute walk from Old San Juan along the coastline. Old San Juan is a unique experience and not overly crowded. Our stay included the Spa Package which included a pedicure and manicure, facial and full body massage for the both of us. I almost forgot, we were pleasantly surprised to receive a welcoming bottle of champagne and chocolates. I don't know where all these cry babies stayed, but for us....we'll definitely go back.

<Content>Never Again!!! This hotel was horrible. We stayed one night after we came back from a cruise. The hotel is in very poor condition. We got a room at what is supposed to be a bargain, $150/night. Where is others have paid up to $300. The room was old and dirty. The shower and bathroom area had rust, dirt and mildew (would not step in side with my bare feet). It looked like it was not cleaned for months. A basic Motel would be nicer and cleaner then this 4 star hotel. The walls and carpet had numerous stains. The closet door was broken. The view of the room was on constructions site and a huge crane. We took pics of all these and other problems on our digital camera and brought it down to the manager. He claimed to be shocked and asked This is taken in this hotel?. We were given another room, but it wasn't much better.The hotel services were not good as well. The service at the restaurants was not good/friendly, and the food was terrible. Show me another restaurant in US that does not have salad dressing for the salads on the menu. The room service food was better then the two restaurants we tried in the hotel. And even that was a problem. The room service took 1 hour and 15 min. to bring us food and after all that wait they brought us coffee and tea w/o sugar.Never Again!!!

<Content>Great Stay With Kids !! We just returned  loved this hotel. We absolutely loved it  don't understand what everyone is complaining about. We stayed on the executive floor, where we found the food great  the cocktail hour especially fantastic. The one thing the hotel lacked is a kids' camp, which it really should add all year round (they have it for 2 weeks in the summer  part of Dec). Other than that it was really kid friendly: they lend kids toys, kids menus (not great-but decent), 2 playgrounds (which were great). It's proximity to San Juan made it a plus.

<Content>We got what we paid for! We stayed at the Caribe Hilton pre cruise and friends of ours stayed both pre and post cruise. We both got the room on Priceline for $69.Having heard rumors of ill treatment with Priceline visitors, I wrote the Caribe a letter. They replied stating that we would have the very best room possible.When we arrived, we had a heck of a time registering (our friends had none). We gave our name to the check-in clerk and he kept insisting that we had ALEADY checked in the hotel. We argued, showed them our confirmation, my letter, etc. The clerk would just keep saying why are you checking in again, you already checked this morning? After about 20 minutes of this, we were finally given the key to our OCEAN FRONT room (our friends were to be just above us).Just upstairs from the lobby, we open the door to our beautiful room and...there are two adults in our bed! Boy, were we ever embarrassed and so were they!Back down to the lobby where we waited another 20 minutes to figure out the problem. No explaination, no apologies! We were then given a room in the tower (a Priceline room this time) near the construction. Our key would not work...back to the desk to get another...the second key doesn't work...a maintenance man let us in the room.We later found out that the couple in our original room had a similar last name to ours and they were given the wrong room. We checked our bill very carefully before we left. We were also afraid that the other couple might get some of our charges.Although the new room was nice and spacious, it was a little dated and miles apart from our friends as well as everything else. There was construction going on in the room above us that didn't stop until 7:30 that night.We did enjoy the grounds, beautiful view and pool area. Morton's Steakhouse was great but way over priced. The portions were also too big. My husband and I shared a small steak and got one side each. Along with the wonderful bread and a salad, we couldn't eat our entire dinner. Split your meal if you dine there.Not too crazy about the surrounding night life. We tried to find the store that has been mentioned for buying alcohol and it was a very scary adventure. We waited until Sunday morning to venture out again.Our friends had great difficulty when they tried to check back into the Caribe after the cruise. They were told the rooms were not ready. After 3:00, they were still not ready. Our friends said that dozens of people were waiting in the open air lobby (during a horrific thunderstorm) for their rooms as well. Finally, at 4:30 they were given a room. It was a horrible room, but they were too tired to argue.For the value of $69 a night, I guess we got what we paid for. I am not sure that I would try them again, however.

<Content>fantastic hotel we had a wonderful time at the caribe hilton! after reading some negative reviews, i really was not sure what to expect- but it could not have been better.it is a beautiful hotel and all of the people we dealt with were very helpful(sandy at the front desk and the consierge jonathan).the bathrooms were lovely- all marble and no mildew. everything in the room was clean and new, the air conditioner worked perfect as did the water in the bathrooms- we were in the main building on the 4th floor. im not sure how anyone could complain about this hotel, we have lived overseas and traveled extensively,i was very impressed with this hotel and i would definitely stay at the caribe again.

<Content>excellent stay Excellent stay Feb. 1-11,2004, at the San Juan Caribe Hilton. Our meals at Morton's of Chicago at the Caribe were exquisite. We were in the garden wing - adjacent to constrution site, but were not disturbed at all - never awakened - I think you'd have to be a VERY light sleeper! Room fine - A/C excellent - we turned it down most often - was too cold! Desk service, poolside service, tour service (I went deep-sea fishing one day) - all up to par - no complaints at all. If you ever thought of going deep sea fishing, be sure to take an anti-motion sickness medication - Dramamine worked for me, thank God, and it was a very rough day (high seas) - anyhow, caught 3 Mahi-Mahi - a lot of fun. Yes, Hilton is expensive - but service and ambience well woth it - you get what you pay for - and you do have to pay a lot. That being said, absolutely no complaints - great time (and great tans!) had by all!

<Content>1/30 pre cruise We stayed at the Hilton before our cruise on the Constellation. The hotel was not that bad but as many suggested not worth what we paid by booking through Celebrity. There is a great workout facility, the pool and lobby area was fantastic, and the beach is nice, since many San Juan properties do not have beaches. Our room was not so good. We were in the tower section of the hotel which was adjacent to the construction (bridge, I think) and we were woken up several times by the noise. We chose to dine at Morton's of Chicago and were disappointed too. Thank goodness the cruise was amazing.

<Content>Not worth anything near rack rates We stayed at this hotel on January 22 pre-cruise. Got the room for $108 on Priceline. For that price, it was acceptable. The best rate I could find at the time for this hotel on non-auction discount booking websites was $300+. Man, would I have been livid had I paid anywhere near that. Our room, while adequate, was more suited to the lower-end Hilton brands than it was to a Hilton resort. Our room was dingy. Not dirty, just old and worn. Most disconcerting was the mold in the bathroom. Apparently there had been a leak in the wall which allowed mold to grow under the paint. The previous poster must have gotten an upgraded room at the Caribe Hilton, because I stayed at the Wyndham El San Juan several years ago, and that room was FAR superior to my room at the Caribe Hilton. Really the only thing the Hilton had going for it was the pool. It was beautiful. It rivaled the El San Juan's pool. Everything else about the Caribe Hilton was far inferior to the El San Juan-the location, the shops, the spa, the restaurants (which were comparably priced). The construction going on at the hotel was an inconvenience as well. Priceline includes this hotel in the same category as the El San Juan and Intercontinental, and it definitely is not in their league.

<Content>We loved it... My husband and I stayed here after a cruise on the Destiny. Immediately leaving the port, we went to the hotel and were able to check in at about 10:30 am. I got this room on Hotwire for $103 and fortunately, we got a room on the 8th floor. Everyone was friendly and unlike other reviews, our room was great. We were at the Wyndham El San Juan, precruise, and this room was better hands down. The view was spectacular. My husband was in love with it. We also enjoyed the executive lounge on the 9th floor. The pool and beach area can't be beat. The main downfall from my point of view was location. The hotel offers a lot on its property, but if you want to venture out, it's going to be at least a $6 taxi ride to go shopping or out to eat. That is, unless you choose to walk across the highway and bridge...

<Content>Just came back from a 4 night stay My husband and I just came back from a 4 night stay at teh Caribe Hilton. We stayed at the hotel as part of an air/hotel package. I would not choose to stay at the hotel again. The front desk was staff was friendly enough, and our check-in was prompt even though we arrived before 3:00 PM. However, the deluxe ocean view room we payed fro was neither deluxe nor did it have a great ocean view. We mostly overlooked construction. The room furnishings were blah, the bed sheets had holes, and the bathroom had several problems. For instance, the bath drain didn't work, the shower door creaked loudly, and the water ran extremely hot and cold while in use. If someone in the next room decides to flush while you are showering, beware!

<Content>DUMP - Does not deserve even one star Affter several trips to the Ritz-Carlton in San Juan, I talked my husband into staying at the Caribe Hilton. Big mistake. We came in on the Spa Package. I was told when I made the reservations that we received breakfast daily and spa treatments. Unfortunately NO ONE at the front desk or in Management could agree on what was included in the package; I had to inform them. Everything at the hotel was a constant battle. Check in is at 3pm and our room was not ready until 4:30pm, we were charged $550 for our spa services (until I spoke with several indifferent staff), the hotel is OLD and dirty, the bed is what you would expect in a Motel-6, the sheets are musty and moist, the air-conditioner was broken and paint was peeling. We were supposed to have a Delux Ocean View and overlooked the building top air conditioners. 4 hours into our stay, I looked at my husband and said You were right - need I say more?

<Content>Not a good choice for Hilton HHonors Members As a frequent Hilton guest, I can attest to some of the negative reviews this property gets. I try to balance my stays at hotels with a comparison of good vs. bad. Unfortunately, Caribe Hilton always has come up in the bad range.Good: Great pool, nice beach, very nice fitness center (I am not sure if they charge extra for this, I uses it for free), very nice staff (in the VIP lounge and floors), adequate room service food, great room service staff, reasonable self parking fees for the area, very close to Old San Juan, located in a great area to jog around.Bad: Rooms are old, dated, musty, in need of renovation, bathrooms are in very bad shape, a/c units don t work properly, maintenance staff is non-responsive (I am still waiting for them to repair a non-functioning safe and too-cold a/c unit, maybe by my next trip) VIP lounge is usually crowded and low on food (since its open to everybody, including small children, staying in their executive level floors, not just to Hilton HHonors top tier members), parking garage is thigh for anything larger than a Toyota Camry and some times full so you have to park in a paved lot by the construction area (don't wash your car, its going to get dirty!), there is construction going on next door and you WILL be waken up at 7:00 am by their cacophony of sounds, restaurants are not very good (eat somewhere off property), downstairs reception staff are not very nice.Overall: Not too good. If you must stay in a Hilton property in San Juan, try the Hampton Inn or the Embassy Suites.

<Content>What a DUMP!!  We spent 5 nights in the Caribe Hilton over the Christmas holiday after returning from a cruise. We had 4 rooms, and without exception they were disgusting. On the first night we were not allowed to check in to all of our rooms until after 6 pm . When we got in, they all smelled of mildew, all had mold, and 2 had plaster falling from the bathroom ceilings. In fact one room had a worker replastering the ceiling when we walked in. I too spoke with the manager who was COMPLETELY indifferent, not even polite. Our partial ocean view was also of a roof and AC units. Rooms routinely were not made up until after 5pm. {now I know why you cant check in at a reasonable hour} 2 of us actually upgraded to a renovated room on a higher floor for $25 {nothing is free at the Caribe} All renovated meant was the bathroom was redone {no plaster falling} same nasty moldy carpet etc. They say meals are free for kids under 5 and 50% 5-12, dont believe it. One day the waiter said only when Adults order buffet {$20 for breakfast} Next day they said only from the Childrens menu, next day when we asked for Childrens Menu, they said they dont have a childrens menu. One night our family of 10 went fo their Mexican Fajita Buffet, advertised on a big poster in the window $19 per person. When the bill came, it was at $25 per person. I went back to the poster, and they had actually taped over the $19 anded pasted a card over it that said $25!! Oh well, you get the idea...... STAY AWAY!

<Content>Loved Peaceful Caribe Just got back from spending 5 nights during New Year's at the Caribe Hilton. A very nice hotel and not bad for the money. Great view of the ocean from the balconey even if the ballroom roof was under the balconey. You could see the waves beautifully breaking on the reefs. Pool and PRIVATE BEACH are excellent. Such a peaceful place to relax  wind down from life in the fast lane. It seems as if people writing reviews forget this is the Carribean  Puerto Rico were life is slow, sometimes slummy and definitely not like living in the USA. Restaurants are pricey. You can get the exact same food from room service for much less in price. Morton's of Chicago had the beat steak I think I have ever tasted. WHAT A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE AT THE CARIBE HILTON!!!!!!!

<Content>Just Back The Caribe Hilton is a decent hotel. Although I would not pay the $350 per night room charge. I would pay under $200. The grounds are beautiful and the staff is great. The bartenders(William and Efrain) in the lobby bar a great. The hotel guests on the other hand are rude. A very snobby cliental come to this hotel(if you know what I mean). They are the type of people that are pushy and rude to the staff. They expect everyone to drop everything for them. The room is clean, but not a $350 a night room. We stayed at the Ritz last year and it was cheaper. They hit you with a resort fee at the end, plus tax. The resort fee is Hiltons tax. Check your bill, because they also charge you a dollar a day to donate to some kids charity(we told Hilton to take it off). Hilton should donate their own money to charity and stop hitting up their guests. Another problem was that it was crowded. I had to get up at 6:30am to get chairs by the pool. We ate a Morton s the first night which was great, but very expensive. The other restaurants at the hotel are just alright. Go out to eat instead. Free food in the lobby bar around 5:30pm. Executive level is ok, but not worth extra money. Save on buying drinks and food at the pool by going across the street to deli and liquor store. Good sandwiches and cheaper bottles of booze. All in all it was a great vacation. Would go back if I could find a low rate.

<Content>Don't waste your time with this aged building For $350 a night, we were soundly disappointed. Room 335 was cramped and our family of 3 only had 2 chairs, and no room for another one. Our view was of the roof, acres and acres of roof, and air conditioners. The drywall around the balcony door was peeled and cracked. One of the sheets had a hole in it. We paid top dollar through a travel agent and I was disgusted. Oh, the public areas and grounds are nice, but I wasn't sleeping there. I talked to manager and he was totally indifferent. He had his money and he didn't care what we thought. Hilton needs to demolish the old wing and stop ruining their reputation by sticking hapless guests in there!!!!!

<Content>Hilton Added a "Resort Fee" to My Bill After I Had Prepaid through Orbitz The hotel was OK but nothing special. I had signed up through Orbitz and paid in advance for the one night I stayed there. Hilton added a charge called resort fee to the bill and separately charged my credit card for that. I inquired and they just said it was an additional charge and to call Orbitz. While the stay was not a disaster, I would never stay there again and I would not use Hilton again unless I had to.

<Content>Wish I was still there I just came back from a wonderful stay at the Caribe Hilton in beautiful San Juan. The hotel was beautiful! Private beach, pool, swim-up bar...it had the works! The room was in great conditions and the sound of the ocean and coquis (the famous Puerto Rico frog) from the balcony, was just incredible and beautiful! For those of you who like to walk, it's just a 30 min. walk from the hotel to Old San Juan. If not, a cab charges you from $6 - $8. But you should definitely visit Old San Juan. There are many places to shop, eat and visit. There is even a Marshall's and Walgreen's, which was very convenient for us. Walgreen's has a One Hour Photo service, which was also very convenient for us:) The places I would suggest you visit is El Morro, which is only $3 to get in, La Fortaleza and Parque de las Palomas (Park of the Birds). There are a few more places, but I can't remember. Also, if you are looking for some traditional Puerto Rican food, I recommend El Jibarito restaurant. It's right in Old San Juan. I don't remember the street it is on, but all you have to do is ask someone and I'm pretty sure they will lead you to it. People in Puerto Rico are so friendly and helpful. The concierge at the Caribe Hilton was so helpful. We asked about places to go dancing or just hang out and have some drinks, and he gave us a list of places to go to for everyday of the week that we were there:) I can say that the most we waisted money on, was cab fare. But, there are to car rental places right on the premises. Other than that, we had a great time and we have plans of going there again next year:)

<Content>we just visited this hotel... we didnt stay at this hotel this december 03, but we visited a bunch of them just to ge tan idea and here is what i can say: The Caribe Hilton is separately from the rest, the beach doesnt have waves(if u mind them them stay there). It's the only hotel with a kinda private beach. The territory is well kept, most of the stuff is outside, which brings some beaty to it. they have live piano player there at night, pools look nice(dont know if they are clean) Whyndham(near Hilton),-nothing special, and the beach is near the main road. The water club, it's good to visit it, but the airport is very close and u can see the plains flying by really close and to get to hte beach u have to cross a street. In order to get to a hote, u have to go through a scary alley or a cab.the lounch on the roof is nice with a good view. The Whyndham El San Juan in Isla Verde is nice. It has a nice area with shops and a lounge with live music. We stayed at MArriott-great hotel.

<Content>Very Disappointed After much searching for an inexpensive honeymoon due to job loss we picked the Caribe Hilton and much to our displeasure. We booked a non-smoking, king deluxe oceanview room and we got a smoking room over looking a constuction site, the roof of the building below with the ocean in the far distance. Instead of hearing oceanwaves we heard the crane every morning at 8. I complained to the front desk as soon as we checked in and was told there was nothing available until the next day. The next day we got nothing but the runaround and they showed us a room that was worse then the one we had. We showed them the paper worked that this was a honeymoon and got nothing. If you are not a businessman or coming with a group this is not the place to be. And judging from all the complaints we heard from other couples in the hotel I guess we were not the only ones that were treated this way. The breakfast buffet was the best thing about the whole package. The conceirge was extremely helpful in finding us local places to eat good spanish food and not sticking us with the hotel restaurants which we did try once and regretted it. The service was horrible and the minimal amount of food you got for the cost was ridiculous. The hotel itself was nice but the staff leaves alot to be desired.

<Content>Enjoyable Stay in the Sun I stayed at the Caribe Hilton in Marsh 2003 with a few friends. We enjoyed our stay at the hotel and found the room and hotel to be clean. Make sure your rate includes the breakfast buffet as it was great and then you don't need to get an $8 burger at lunch. The beach area is small and man-made but clean and private, perfect for kids. We took advantage of the yoga class and the gym. The hotel is a short cab ride from Old San Juan. In terms of restaurants there is something to please everyone, though none are cheap. Check out luxurylink.com for good deals at this hotel. I would stay here again on another trip to the island, provided I found another internet deal.

<Content>Great Deal thru Priceline I have never paid $65/night for a hotel before. Thanks to Priceline, I was able to book this hotel @ such a great price. Not only that, they had upgraded me to the club level. The hotel was empty at first but by the end of the week it filled up. The pools are great, but I happened to notice with the sunlight, that the pool was quite dirty. Another drawback is that there is no longer a casino, if you don't have a car, you have to hike 15 - 20 minutes each way to Condado or take a cab $10 each way. Very relaxing and suggest to book thru priceline, or Hotwire. Chances are it will be this hotel @ 4****stars, or a resort. Hilton HHonors members still get a continental breakfast for free on the second floor. The staff was great except for the Bell boys, and Valet. When I arrived, and I had seen they did not come up to take my luggage, I asked them to and they acted stupid, until I reported it to the front desk manager, which is nearby. Also, at 6:00 by the bar and the second floor, they both offer cocktails, and on the second floor drinks, and cocktails, all free. I reccomend this hotel if you do not want to spend $200 + on the Ritz, or El San Juan. I have stayed a the Ritz, before finding Hotwire or Priceline, and I feel that it is to stuffy for a young person. If you can get The Water Club, the Intercontinental, Ritz, or El San Juan at around the same price, stay at one of those, if not stay at the caribe.

<Content>Worth the Trip There is a certain charm to staying at a classic hotel witth so much history. Granted you can't see too much of it because of the renovations, but this is a fine hotel in an excellent location. Perfectly located for the beach, Old San Juan, and the Condado, it's probably the best placed hotel in the area. The rooms are well maintained and appropriately appointed. Service is what you would expect in a large Hilton. Don't expect personalized service like you would get in a boutique hotel, but that's not the Caribe Hilton. It you're looking for a beach/city vacation - it's a great choice.

<Content>Not an ideal pit stop If I had to stay again in Puerto Rico, I would not recommend this hotel. On the surface, it is nice, clean, and well-maintained. However, compared to other Hiltons I have stayed at (and there have been a lot, I travel frequently), the outside does not match the inside! The hotel staff is not overly friendly - we had an issue when I was checking in - the staff lost some paperwork and could not process my check in. The bartenders are okay, but don't look for strong drinks! The concierge was less than helpful for a woman traveling by herself on business. I will say that the waiters in the restaurants were by far the friendliest and most outgoing staff around.The rooms are okay - I had an ocean view as I was promised, but it was over the bulk of the hotel. Instead of hearing waves, I heard the nice hum of the air conditioner. The showers need to be majorly upgraded - barely any water pressure.If you are looking at a hotel for honeymooning or pleasure travel, keep going. Everything is a cab ride away, there is nothing within walking distance, and the hotel restaurants are too expensive for what they offer. The beach is nice, but there are other places to stay in Puerto Rico for beaches - this isn't one of them.Of all the hiltons I have stayed at, I will honestly say that this was the worst experience that I have had a hotel - there is no excuse for a desk staff to be as inept as they were, and by judging the amount of problems other visitors have faced, if you don't want a hassle, don't stay here.

<Content>'Hilton' should get their name off of this one! Just returned from 5 nights @ the Caribe Hilton. Problems started upon check-in. After having made reservations six months in advance, we were told no King rooms were available because there weren't cleaned yet. (It was 4:00 pm). When asked how much longer it would be, the desk clerk told us he could not say. He sent us to look @ a Handicapped King room, but after lugging 4 suiitcases to preview the room, it was a Standard bed, not King. We then went back to the desk clerk-told him No and were then told a King room was now available in the Tower Bldg. The decor  paint in this room has not been touched since the early 80's. Lots of construction going on outside the hotel and rhey start @ 7:00 am sharp each morning! Out of 5 nights, I had to call for washcloths 4. (They brought 2 for 2 people bathing twice a day). The pool area is the best thing about his place. The restaurants @ the Caribe are expensive. This hotel offers little more than swimming during the day, (pools are closed @ night), and drinking. Yet their prices reflect a primo charge which should include alot more services and choices for their guests.

<Content>Buyer Beware The Caribe Hilton is a mixed bag, I have stayed there 3 times. I love the calm beach and the cafe for breakfast. I don't mind spending 20 bucks a day for a great breakfast, (it really is awsome!) when Im vacationing (if you cant afford to splurge a little stay home, you can pay 250- for the room then run around looking for a 3- bagle and coffee) The rooms are expensive for the condition they are in, if not a complete rip off. I first stayed there in 1987 and they were very nice then. The longer short building is the older one, rooms are like closets and light fixtures don't work, mattresses are very old like wood boards, I had back pain and couldnt sleep. The tacky paneling has to go!I was told the two beds were queen size and they turned out to be doubles. Bait and switch or bait and LieThe loction is ideal if you rent a car. The Spa looks nice new restaurants etc. The Front desk changed our room which was awful, the second one overlooked the air fan of the restaurant. I was planning to go back this November but It dosnt seem to have gotten any better from the reviews. Despie The construction, the sound of sawblades while trying to relax on the beach. I don't think so, especially at those prices.I wouldnt mind spending the money but the hotel needs alot of TLC to get to an acceptable level.

<Content>Both good and bad aspects of this hotel My boyfriend and I went to the Caribe Hilton for 4 nights this August. There were some good parts and bad parts about this hotel and the San Juan area that people planning a trip there should be aware of. The best part of the entire trip was that all of Team USA (NBA) was staying at this hotel as well as all of the other basketball teams from other countries. We met some players!  Our vacation started off by the front desk telling us there weren't any queen bed ocean view rooms available, despite our voucher stating that was the type of room we were guaranteed. They made us a deal that if we stayed in a Parlor Room (with a sofabed), we would have access to the Executive Suite for our entire stay. The Executive Suite was a room that served drinks and snacks during certain times. Trust me, the trade off wasn't worth it! Besides that incident, everything else was pretty good.  The hotel itself was nice, the pool area was pretty and so was the lobby/bar area. The beach area was just so- so. I've been to several other places in the Caribbean, Hawaii, and Mexico with nicer beaches. The sand was rough, and you couldn't swim too far in the ocean because of huge rocks. After seeing the beach area near other hotels, (El San Juan, Intercontinental) I was a bit upset at the condition of the Hilton's beach. If you are a big dancer, don't expect this hotel to cater to you. We went to a club at the El San Juan instead. Nightlife in San Juan wasn't the best!  The breakfast buffet was good, but that was the only meal we ate there. As far the the hotel's location, I wasn't too impressed. Every time we wanted to go to other hotels, it was a $16.00 cab ride each way! The proximity to Old San Juan was great though.  If you want to come to a hotel, hangout by the beach/pool, and eat all of your meals in once place, the Caribe Hilton would be a good choice. But if you want to be able to explore other areas and take advantage of the nightlife, be prepared to pay big in taxi fees.

<Content>I loved it! We stayed for a long weekend last February and loved it. 1.) The room was not fancy, but it was just fine with us. It was roomy. We had a great water view, king bed  balcony. 2.) The buffet breakfast was great. It was a great spread, with lots of fresh fruit and other goodies. 3.) The messages at their spa were the best. I had two and both were done the same way. I could tell they trained thier staff well, unlike some other hotels. 4.) The beach was private, nice and clean. 5.) They had entertainment at night - a small combo band. We checked out some of the other hotels around and we were glad we stayed where we did. Some of the other places had littered beaches, freezing cold lobbies attached to smokey casinos, and loud airplane noise. Yes, it is a bit pricey, but we thought it was worth it for a long weekend. A good value overall.

<Content>Absoulutely the Best buy for the money! This was our first time to Puerto Rico, and really researched many travel books and articles. I also read many of the reviews about the Caribe Hilton, so I know that everyone has different expectations and opinions. I have lived in the Bahamas for years and am aware what humidity and caribbean weather and customs are like. We found the Caribe Hilton to be wonderful!!The check-in personnel was smiling and made us feel welcome after a long flight. We stayed in the tower and had a fabulous view. If there was an oversight of needing towels, we only had to pick up the phone, and it was brought immediately. The open atrium, with the ocean view was beautiful and inviting. The bar downstairs has the best bartenders, best drinks, live entertainment, and hospitality! The tour desk, set up tours and was very accurate and detail oriented about each tour. I suggest the Spread Eagle snorkel tour.....everything from the 51'FT. Catamaran (new) to the food, drinks,and crew were the best! Very proffessional! The concierge desk made some of the best suggestions..where to go, how to go, what their specialty was, who to ask for. He even called ahead for us too! 25 cents to take a bus (new and airconditioned) into Old San Juan, for shopping sightseeing. He gave us maps and circled places to visit. I find if you treat people with kindness and with a smile you just might get the same in return!! Try it in your travels, you may be surprised!!

<Content>Disappointed We thought we got a great deal on Hotwire until we got there. There was a water leak in our room from the floor abover ours. That didn't mix well with the hot and humid climate of PR. The room developed a musty smell and they never offered to switch our rooms. Housekeeping staff was nosey. The restaurant food quality was poor. The definitely added on additional charges when we were checking out. The plus points..the swimming pool is nice, location is good (close to Old San Juan, Contado). We were fortunate to have a nice view of the water. This definitely didn't live up to Hilton standard.

<Content>Great architecture...but check Priceline This is a very nice luxury hotel...what you would expect from Hilton...through Priceline, I got a room for $75 a night. Parking is another $10. If you stay, stay in the old section of the hotel. This is the portion right above the lobby and all of the rooms there have ocean views.If you love wacky late 40's early 50's modern architecture, you will love this place. Huge open air lobby, weird curves everywhere, and really interesting 50's modern looking furniture everywhere. Incredible.This place is a little far from Old San Juan. If you want to go to OSJ, it will cost you about $10 in cab fare. However, get the concierge to tell you where the bus stop is. It will cost you .50 in bus fare to get to Old San Juan.Also, this place is right across the bridge from Condado. While overall this is a safe area, I would not walk the bridge at night because it is a very long bridge and there is some construction going on.Next, the restaurants in here are EXPENSIVE. For breakfast, you will see a little corner restaurant right when you drive into the hotel property, about 100 yds. or less from the main lobby. Go over there. You can get a great $3 breakfast v. $22 in the hotel.If you are there, look at going over to the Hotel Normandie next door. Fantastic 30s art deco hotel that has been fully restored.Last note....one of the best pools I have been in at any hotel. Multi layered, fountains, waterfalls, etc. Normally not into lounging in pools, but made an exception here.THERE IS NO CASINO! Nearest casino is about 1/2 to 1 mile away.Lots of good places to eat nearby. E mail me if you have any questions. Put something like Caribe Hilton in the opening, so I know it isn't spam.JEH

<Content>IS WORTH A STAY We stayed nine days and had a great time. The beach and pool are both top notch. The water in the beach was calm as it is protected from the high Atlantic surf. It is not as perfectly run as a Hilton in the states but you cant beat the scenery and nearby location to old San Juan. The fitness club was excellent and we received good housekeeping service. Try to get a floor above the 5th for a good view.

<Content>Not worth the money My husband and I stayed at the Caribe Hilton for our honeymoon this summer. The only people that smiled at us were the housekeepers. The front desk was rude and not helpful. We also had a lot of additional things tacked onto our bill that we didn't use and were not told about. We ordered ice cream through room service one night and it took 1 hour to get it. I tried to talk to someone about how rude everyone was being and how poor the service was, but all the guy at the front desk said was oh. The rooms were also dated and we never had cold water. We had to brush our teeth with hot water. We plan on going back to Puerto Rico, but we will not stay at the Caribe Hilton or at any Hilton again. We were very disappointed.

<Content>Hot climate, Cold environment Unsmiling, unfriendly staff barely greeted us or offered any assistance when questioned. Hot water bathroom faucet did not shut off properly, shower plug pulled out of socket. No cold running water anywhere. Staff activities were cancelled daily without any communication to guests, as we waited for water aerobics and bingo. Nobody knew if the instructors were going to show up or not.Very tip oriented, uncomfortable feeling throughout hotel. Didn't feel like a guest. Upon check-out, was told to simply leave key in room. Nobody asked if we enjoyed our stay. Cold attitude, very expensive restaurants, dangerous area to walk at night. Wyndham next door had casino, better restaurant choices and smiling faces.

<Content>Bad service We book a 12 days vacation with Yahoo vacations, and the 1st thing that was bad was the airline seats . Seats in the plane were left over types,upon arrival the Frone Desk took very long but after checking in they assigned the worst room you can be in. There was a construction site accross the room view  in front of the parking lot entrance. The room was very old with mold in the bathroom, the sliding door in the balcony did not work. After complining for 2 days we were move to a better location but there was mold in the bathroom, shower head did not work, there was mold in the air conditioning receptacle. Prices were very expensive  the food not that great. One positive thing the private beach was great,although, people not staying in the Hotel were coming to the beach unstop.We were ble to get around in the car and visit other beautuful locations.

<Content>Caribe Hilton Deluxe Room Not So Upon our arrival at the Caribe Hilton two hours after its 3:00 p.m. check-in time, we learned that our room would not be ready for at least another hour. We left our bags with the bellman, and, because the front desk has no safe in which to put our cash and travel docuemnts, we remained nearby, given the Condado area's justifiable criminal reputation.After we finally go our keys, we pick up our unattended bags, as anyone else could have, and went to our deluxe ocean view room. Its carpet was stained and burned; the walls were scuffed; adn the shower and vanity faucets needed repair.In addition, the safe was locked. It was finally opened after another two hours, but our chance to explore the area safely had been lost for the night. Despite a detailed note to the general manager the following morning, in the same and detail as this one, I got no response whatsoever (not even a We hope to serve you better in the future). The stains remained, and the plumbing malfunctioned throughout our stay.Future guests are well advised to check their bills carefully: Several unauthorized and incorrect charges appeared on ours.

<Content>Nice place, friendly staff Just came back on the 16th of August after 8 days in sunny Puerto Rico. We stayed at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan. The facilities and grounds were very nice, the family enjoyed the large pool and the small private beach area very much. Being a family of four on a budget, we found their restaurants there to be expensive though, and chose to venture out on our own for our meals. There are a couple small typical Puerto Rican cafes within a block walk that were good for breakfast ( bacon, eggs, toast and coffee for about $4), and most days we walked over the bridge to the Condado area for dinner. There is also a Sizzler steakhouse within walking distance that was excellent and very reasonable. The closest casino is at the Wyndham Condado Plaza, again a little walk over the Condado Lagoon bridge (about 20 minutes on foot). We found the Hilton staff to be very pleasant and helpful and had no problems whatsoever, other than about an hour or so wait for our room to get ready at check-in. The biggest downside to staying at the Hilton was the distance from any other hotels, restaurants, etc. if you don't mind walking or waiting for a bus or just want a quiet day at the pool its a great place to stay. We did rent a car from Charlie's for three days (highly recommend them, excellent service and prices) and explored the Island a little- drove to the rainforest, Luquillo beach (great place!) and even took a ride to the southern shore and swam in a deserted public beach near Arroyo ( Balneario Punta Guilarte)- we were the only ones there! Driving around San Juan is a real adventure, though- I think all one million people that live there have a car. Overall, a great place with friendly people and beautiful natural resources.

<Content>I think I spent too much...? Stayed there in April in part because of some of the reviews I read on this website. I wish I would've waited till now since some of the more honest opinions have been posted recently. This hotel isn't really as nice as all the pictures on it's website. The room we had was a big dissapointment to me. My boyfriend was satisfied since it was one of his first times anywhere out of the country. The view was awful. Yeah you have a balcony but all you see is the roof top of the restaurants at the hotel. The pool isn't that nice  the beach is AWFUL! It's not even a beach. It's a man made hole with LOTS  LOTS of cigerette butts all over. I was so surprised when I saw that. The bathroom wasn't that nice. The tub was kinda dirty  scummy. Overall it's ok but DO NOT expect to get the Hilton that they portray in their website. It is not at all like it. The pictures are very decieving! If by looking at them you think you'd be staying at a 5 star hotel think again! It's more like a 2 star.

<Content>a great place to relax My husband and I planned a trip to Puerto Rico. Didn't know where to stay, etc. Our travel Agency in Paramus recommended the Caribe Hilton just a short ride to Old San Juan.We left on Continental air lines on July 13 and arrived safely to the beautiful warm weather after all the cold and horrible weather in New Jersey since November last year. We took a cab (they don't pick you up like in the other Islands) $16.00 to go to hotel.when we arrived at Caribe, the hotel is completely open (no doors etc) and just went in to register when we were given the 20th floor looking out at Construction views while we were suppose to have an ocean view, we paid for. we finally moved to the 11th floor overlooking part of the ocean and much of the street below, very disappointing for us.Dinners at Hotel are expensive. Cabs to and from town cost $7.00 or 8.00 one way, very expensive to travel around and most of the cab drivers do not speak English, so this is very difficult to communicate there. The beach is beautiful, warm water, lounges, pool, pool bar and 2 pools really neat but not heated like other resorts. Temp was 80's and very windy.We did go over to Bicardi Rum factory, you need to take a taxi to the ferry, and then wait over 1 hr. while they go back and forth plus go out for gas.silly things they do. I highly recommend this tour it is a great place to see and so beautiful and serene.(they tell you about buses) but we could not find any or you wait for ever and its too hot in the sun to stand and wait. They do not have any schedules, they come whenever, so that's a time waste.We went to other hotels to see them and try our luck at gambling, the casino's are very small not large at all.We went to native Puerto Rico's restaurents and they were great, treated us exceptionally nice.Shuttles in town take forever, you can walk faster than wait for them. Town is fun, very narrow streets and traffic moves only on one way streets there. the horse and buggy ride is very expensive there so walk, use the money for shopping.Breakfast daily at the Caribe was delightful. place sand food was great. people are also very very pleasant. Yes I would go back for another trip but would like to stay closer to Old San Juan. too expensive to do taxi's every day back and forth and to restaurents at night that you would like to eat at Fine dining.I suggest that this hotel get with the times, have a shuttle for guests to designated areas (they can well afford it) and also pick up folks at airport.Also I think they should have a welcoming drink for the guests when they arrive just to be hospitable.I am going to write the hotel with these ideas. what do you think???

<Content>Better hotels out there After reading reviews of the Caribe Hilton, we really expected much more. The people at the front desk were unfriendly, we had a problem with the suite we requested and had to argue to change rooms, the lobby was musky and not so nice, and overall, the hotel was out-dated despite the supposed renovations. We also didn't appreciate the constant construction and the lovely crane that sat in our beach view. Just not a very nice hotel - suprising for Hilton as I've been impressed by them before. Stay somewhere else for the money. You'll be happy you did.

<Content>Hilton beach is great QUE PASO?!! I can't say anything bad about the Caribe Hilton. We arrived late at night and check-in was fine. The double double garden room was fine, balcony overlooking the garden. The room was clean and had a mini-bar, which was a good place to put my store bought beer. The beach is great, quiet, easy lagoon with the breakers out beyond the jetty. We even watched a couple get married right there on the beach! The Olas spa has great food, I had the steak and cheese wrap - yummy. We did have to pay 10.00 for parking though. But at check-out when I disputed a 10.00 beverage charge, they simply removed it. OH YEAH, Warning, I had walked down the street to one of those local food joints the morning of check-out: 30 minutes to get a fried egg sandwich!!! Mostly, the local service in San Juan is severely lacking! A great night out is Saturday night at the El San Juan Hotel and Casino, where all the gorgeous people mingle in the lobby bar. Old San Juan is not dangerous the way the fodor's books makes it out to be. There are local cops everywhere. Took a nice walk around El Morro. Went to Senor Frog's - there was a cruise ship in, so it felt like stupid long island, but the place is fun. Coqui?!

<Content>Our Experience at the Caribe Hilton 6/19-24/2003 I made the choice to stay at the Caribe Hilton by reading reviews as well as thoroughly researching this property. It was a tough decision whether to stay at the Wyndom or the Caribe Hilton, however the reviews written by other travellers was the deciding factor. First let me encourage you to go on hotel sites and read the comments made by those who have stayed there. Those comments can be very helpful. I found the hotel to be very nice and well kept up. The staff was helpful, with the exception of two gentlemen who happened to work at the Concierge's Desk. Please know I will be sharing my comments about their attitude with the Caribe Hilton Management Staff along with a suggestion that those two individuals receive more training in providing customer service if they are to continue in that type of a position. The rooms were nicely decorated with adequate space. The restaurant prices were extremely high and the food wasn't exceptional, espcially for the price. Although the hotel was full the majority of our stay, we never experienced any loud sounds---that says a lot about the quality of the facility. Unless you desire to stay in the heart of Old San Juan or San Juan, the Caribe Hilton is the place to stay, especially if you want a comfortable but stylish facility with very professional and courteous staff (with the exception of two gentlemen at the Concierge's Desk) The Health Spa-Fitness Center was excellent. The pool area was lovely and the grounds were very nice. My only two recommendations would be -Eat somewhere else so that you can enjoy more activities with your money, and wait for the shift to change if you find the staff (Eric and Jose) at the Concierge's desk unfriendly and not very helpful - believe me there are other staff who are excellent.

<Content>Agreed, OK But Not Great I got our room for $65 (priceline) a night and that was about what it was worth. Compared to the Hilton Resort on the Big Island of Hawaii this resort is second rate. I can't imagine anyone paying $200-$1000 a night to stay here. I travel a lot and am a Hilton Goldcard holder. Their complimentary Hilton Honors member's lounge with continental breakfast and afternoon snacks is a joke. I usually see better at a Hampton Inn. The rooms were just standard rooms but with mold, missing paint, burnt out light bulbs, clock not set, broken sink plugs, ants in bathroom, fridge didn't work, pool was dirty, and the directions for the room safe were so worn you couldn't read them. I expect much better from a Hilton, although I was told that this was a nice hotel for the carribean area. Having said all that, the staff was, courteous and helpful, the food was excellent, but pricey, and Puerto Rico was fabulous. Rent a car from Charlie car rental about $30 a day, take a catarmaran snorkeling trip ($55) and visit the rain forest (awesome.) Old San Juan is typical tourist shops and some good restuarants. If I was to go back I would stay in the Embassy Suites or near Condado area, a nice place to walk, shop, and eat. If you want nice beaches get away from San Juan, visit Culebra or one of the other smaller islands. Great place, overpriced hotel.

<Content>Everything butt the... I stayed at the Caribe for a week this past spring and absolutely loved it. The Concierge, Eric, is fabulous, friendly and knowledgeable. He sent my travelling companinon and I to some off the beaten path local restaurants that were wonderful. My only criticism of the hotel is the omnipresence of cigarette butts in the sand, both in the coconut grove, and on the beach. There are NO outdoor ashtrays or spent-butt-buckets anywhere at the resort, which is a disappointment. At high tide, the butts are loosed from the sand and float in the water everywhere. Surely a hotel of this caliber could arrange for either ashtrays, or at the very least, sift the sand regularly. If you don't mind the filter fish, it's a perfect vacation selection.

<Content>OK, not great Having read most of the reviews, my wife and I were really expecting a very beautiful hotel. The hotel property was beautiful (although they are doing construction right next to the hotel) and was not too disappointing. The restaurants at the hotel are very good (but definitely overpriced). The bar was pretty fun--This hotel is the place where the Pina Colada first was made, so that was pretty cool. Our hotel room, however, was fairly dirty (especially the bathroom) and just quite average. The pool is ok, the small beach was ok. The dock overlooking the ocean and tropical fish was really neat (there are shark and baracuda at night--really cool). Rent a car (although the traffic is horrible) or expect to pay for taxis. Walking from this area is pretty spooky, especially at night! We wouldn't go back to Puerto Rico or Caribe Hilton until we visit the other 100 places we would like to see.

<Content>I loved the hotel I had a super time this spring break. Puerto Rico is gorgeous and the people are great. I think that Puerto Rico is one of the most romantic places to be if you are traveling with someone special. If you are traveling alone it is still awesome. The clubs are also fun. The Caribe Hilton is an excellent hotel to stay at. The hammocks are cool and the pool and view of the ocean are great. When I go back to San Juan (Condado), the Caribe Hilton is where I will stay. The hotel is a little out of the way of downtown San Juan, but it only takes 5 to 7 minutes to get downtown by cab depending on the traffic. Personally, I prefer it that way.

<Content>Grand time at a bargain rate Stayed from May 17th thru 23rd and had a great time. Basically, we got the room for under $100 so in my opinion this place is a downright luxury bargain. The room basically looked like every other Hilton room -- nice, clean but corperate. Our room had a view of the inlet (and part of the parking garage). The staff was exceptionally friendly. The spa was expensive but wonderful. The beach was private, a little rocky, but nice(fantastic snokeling right off the shore -- thousands of fish). The grounds and pool area are extraordinary and well maintained. The food and drinks were overpriced and mediocre, but considering it's hotel food, we expected that. The location near Old San Juan was wonderful, you're better off just taking the bus (25c) or taxi ($8) and enjoying the amazing restaurants there. The giftshop (again) is overpriced but we just went to the Walgreens in Old San Juan to stocked up on water and supplies for 1/3 of the price. Travel desk was staffed by an insane (but very friendly  helpful) woman. Highly recommend the Spread Eagle Catamaran trip and the Rainforest tour. Basically I stay here before I'd stay anywhere in the Condado, though the Intercontinental and Wyndham in Isle Verde are nicer (but far from Old San Juan which is the gem of the city).

<Content>Past Prime This hotel is past it's prime. It's aging and showing it. Although the view was beautiful, the water would not turn off in the shower - had to call maintenance, the maid left the sheets she changed dumped on the floor, the room was small. Overall it was just an okay hotel - would not stay there again.

<Content>Loved Puerto Rico We arrived at Caribe Hilton and we loved the open lobby, parrot and live music playing. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was ready after 20 minutes during which time they told us where we could change and place our bags if we wanted to go to the pool. The hotel has been remodeled recently and the lobby, outdoor pools, restaurants, and shops show it. We felt this was the best grounds possible with many pools, palm trees, hammocks, swim to bars it was a dream! We only had seven days and we did many day trips but had a hard time because it was so beautiful at the Caribe Hilton. You can easily walk the 3 miles to Old San Juan, it is a beautiful walk all along the ocean. You can find amazing food in Condado area a 1/2 mile walk. The tour through the hotel to Culebra snorkeling was the best. Lonely Planet tour book is very helpful. LOVED IT!

<Content>Nightmare When we arrived in at the Caribe Hilton on 5/18/2003, we were pleasantly suprised at the landscape and grounds, but horribly dissappointed with the room. First of all, it had wood panel walls, the bathrrom sink nobs wouldn't turn unless you are Hulk Hogan, and the balcony door didn't open until my 250lb boyfriend literally threw himself on it. The room itself had the look of a cabin in the mountains rather than a tropical paradise. We aren't cpmlainers, so we sucked it up and decided to make the best of the resort without asking to switch rooms.the staff were generally pleasant, but I was very embarrassed one night when I went to take a walk on the pier very late and one of the lobby men came out to see if I was alright, thinking that maybe I was going to jump or something. It was nice he was concerned but I was very uncomfortable with the situation. Everything else was okay throughout the week, but then again we didn't spend much time at the hotel. The real kicker was at the end of the week when we had to leave and called for a wake-up call for 5:00am. We didn't recieve the call, or at least we thought we didn't when we woke up at 8:00 am and realized we missed our flight! My boyfriend went to the front desk immediately and talked to a man named Lewis who informed us that the hotel made a mistake and they were very sorry. When we checked for the next flight, the next one we could get was 4 days away! So we had to spend 4 more nights and lots more money not to mention missed work. The hotel refused to help compensate us at all including giving us a room for any of those four nights. Then another desk clerk had the gull to say that we had recieved the wake-up call, but we must have slept through it. After lots of investigating it was determined that our phone malfunctioned. After all of this, we didn't get so much as an I'm sorry from this 5 star hotel. Absolutely ridiculous! We would never stay there again and we don't recommend that anyone else does either. Thedham which are priced the same and much more elegant.
