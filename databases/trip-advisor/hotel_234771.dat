<Content>Dont even bother During my trip around France, Italy, Greece following a conference in Athens I can say without a doubt this was the worst hotel I stayed at. A word of caution- dont confuse 'tourist house liberty' with 'hotel liberty' a totally different hotel. I did, I paid the price. Whilst very centrally located thats the end of anything positive for this hotel. Staff were unhelpful. The room was average with a poor bathroom. An absolute disgrace was linen and towels only being changed every 3 days! 'Breakfast' which was stated as included was a small pastry and a coffee in a snack bar down the road. the office was locked up from 5pm with a sign 'please call office staff if any problems'- with the only phone in the hotel being inside the office. I could go on for a long time about various other negative regarding this hotel. Dont go here, or you'll also regret it.

<Content>Utterly horrible! We booking this property after desperately searching for availability for June 18 and 19, 2008. The reviews for Tourist House Liberty noted that it a terrible option. We can confirm these reviews. This is a horrible place to stay.We booked the Tourist House Liberty Bed and Breakfast. We even sent a confirmation email to ensure that they had booked us into the bed and breakfast, as many of the reviews noted that the hotel staff had moved them to their adjacent property, Hotel Aline. They emailed us back to confirm that we were booked into the Bed and Breakfast for two nights. Upon arrival, they told us that our booking was for Hotel Aline. They don't speak a lot of English and we don't speak a lot of Italian so we had quite a challenge communicating. In the end, after waiting about twenty minutes, they agreed to give us a room in the Tourist House Liberty Bed and Breakfast.Our room was awful. In the far wing of the hotel are three rooms marked 10, 11 and 12. These rooms appear to be decent. We were not put in these marked rooms. We were put in a room marked privated. The first room on the left in the far wing of the hotel. It was dark. Only two of our lights were working. The chandelier had been ripped out of the ceiling (rooms 10, 11 and 12 have this chandelier still). There were holes in the walls. Our feet were black after walking on our floor. The bed is sagging. We actually slept on the really dirty futon in the corner of the room on the second night because the bars of the bed, which poke through the mattress, hurt us so much. We had to use the shared bathroom. It is so small that it can only accommodate one person. It is a shower/toilet in a closet-size room. There is lots of hot water. The toilet paper is outside of the shower/toilet so make sure to bring some in if you use the toilet. I think the worst part of our stay was that the hotel only gave us one hotel for two people, and the hotel was wet (?!?!?).Although we paid for breakfast, we never received it on either day. We asked the staff about breakfast. They told us that we would have to pay an additional 5 Euros (per person/ per day) to receive the breakfast. We had already paid 20 Euros (5 per person/ per day) and weren't about to pay it again.For the cost of this property, you can stay in a beautiful four-star hotel with breakfast in Pisa. All we can say is --- don't bother. This place is a joke.

<Content>Awful and unlawful credit card transactions Don't book this hotel and dont give them your credit card details.This hotel is nothing like it looks in the pictures. They don't give you the double room you book, the beds are rotten, the room smells, is dark and the bathroom is so small it is unbelievable. The breakfast is a pre-packed broken biscuit or cake with cold coffee and fake orange juice.Worst of all they charge you for nights you have not stayed. We booked for 7 nights, stayed 1 night begrudgingly as it was late and dark . We complained there and then that the room was not what we had booked (given twin instead of double) and we were not given an alternative room. We settled our bill in cash for the first night, were given a receipt and then i have just returned home today to find they have charged me for 6 additional nights on my credit card. What a nice way to end my easter break. I now have to dispute it with mastercard and the booking agent. They have done this to others it appears from the reviews, so do not book this hotel! I have travelled arund the world and never had such a bad experience. Oh and don't bother staying in Pisa either its horrible!

<Content>better budget hotels out there The lumpy beds are the worst I've ever slept on. We had a private bathroom down the hall from our room. Stumbling in the middle of the night in your pj's, trying to unlock doors just to go to the bathroom is not fun. The bathroom was also the worst I've seen, even for a budget hotel in Europe. The toilet and shower are crammed IN THE SAME 3ft X 3ft cubicle!!! The shower drain was also plugged so you were ankle deep in water. If you keep on looking, you'll find better budget hotels out there.

<Content>DISGRACE! I booked a double room at the hotel and on arrival my wife and I we're unhappy with the standard of accomodation on offer and eventually had to check into another hotel I found out on my return that they had charged m the full 95 euros even though I had only been in the room for 15 minutes! I am still trying to retrieve the money now...the photo's make the place look fairly nice but trust me it's not anything like that, the room was old and musty and the bathroom you would not dare take a shower in there...

<Content>Extremely helpful staff, Great location, Clean After staying at the Tourist House Liberty for three nights with my girlfriend and our friend, I couldn't believe some of the negative reviews I read here.First off, the manager, Max, was as helpful and friendly a person as we met on our entire vacation. His recommendations were flawless, andhis attention to detail and willingness to accomodate all requests were refreshing. My girlfriend also had made the reservations with him via email, very conveniently.As for the hotel itself, we were happy with the overall quality and even impressed, especially for the price. Our room was on the second floor of the building that houses Tourist House Liberty (the hotel occupies only the second floor of a 7 story building). Our bed was very comfortable, as were the clean sheets, and the cot that was arranged for our friend fit in the spacious room just fine, and was comfortable as well. The view of the neighborhood out the window was great, and the bathroom seemed almost new, with a large shower/tub that had GREAT water pressure (always nice to find while traveling).The hotel was also centrally located, as other reviews mentioned, and felt very safe. (There were some rowdy partiers on the street at night, and as you got closer to the train station it was a bit sketchy at night too, but the hotel felt very secure.)Perhaps our expectations were set lower than other travelers, as we are young and were not looking for a luxury hotel, just a clean comfortable place to stay for a few nights...but I have stayed at various outstanding hotels in other cities in recent years, and if going back to Florence, would definitely stay at Tourist House Liberty again.

<Content>Being Cheated I felt I was cheated by Tourist House Liberty. When I booked through Tourist House Liberty's internet, I was never told that I will be assigned to a different room across the street called Hotel Albine. And all their email correspondence is named under Tourist House Liberty. What happens is Albine and Liberty are affiliated and they share the same reception located at Tourist Liberty. The room standard in Hotel Albine is way worse than the Tourist House Liberty in terms of decor and cleanliness. The hallway stinks badly and the beds are overly mellow that hurts your back. So, when you book, make sure they assign you a room at Tourist House Liberty, not Hotel Albine!One more thing, although my email confirmation says the price would include free breakfast, I didn't get anything at all. When I inquired, they said breakfast is only for guests at Liberty but not at Hotel Albine.

<Content>Good Value, Good Location Trip Advisor Member, Colorado USAAfter reading other reviews just before we left for Italy we were very apprehensive about what we would find when we arrived at Tourist House Liberty. We were pleasantly surprised at both the location and our accommodations. This BB is walking distance from almost everything we wanted to see. We were just a couple of blocks from the Central Market which had great restaurants and lots of shopping. Just a few more blocks and we were in the center of Florence. Our room was a double matrimonial and faced the street. It was very clean and had plenty of space. The building is old (wasn't everything in Italy??) and there was not a lift but that did not present a problem for us. There is a computer for guest use at no charge. Since we had been in Italy for over two weeks without access except at internet cafes (for a fee), it was a plus for us.The staff is what impressed us the most. They were helpful, responsive, and kind. For the money, this is a great value.

<Author>In_Love_With_Paris
<Content>Worst hotel I've ever stayed at! I was so depressed when I arrived at this hotel. It's up a large flight of stairs--no elevator. The lobby looks nothing like the lobby pictured in the hotel's on-line ad. It is not nice. My room was the worst. It wass as small as a jail cell, tiny bed, one little chair, cabinet for clothes, tiny table. It is the smallest room I have ever seen. It smelled bad and they actually had an air freshener on the window ledge to attest to that. The view was the back of a building--reminded me of a tenement on the worst side of New York City. The bathroom was so small I couldn't even move in it. The room was dirty. There were hairs, not only on the bedspread but even on the sheets. The place literally gave me the creeps. I immediately went out and found another hotel where I stayed for the rest of my visit in Florence (6 additional nights) but I had to stay here the first night or lose my money. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone for any reason. The only positive is the young man who runs the place is really a nice guy. He was helpful in getting me a reservation for the Academia before I arrived and gave me the lay of the land when I arrived. However, honestly, the place was dumpy and dirty. Oh, they also offer breakfast and they bring it to your room because apparently there isn't a room where we could all eat together. I kept envisioning that I would receive bread and water because my room seemed like a little cell. Needless to say, I didn't stay for breakfast so I never found out what breakfast was like.

<Content>Tourist House Liberty Austust 21, 2006Tourist House LibertyWe had made reservation thru, internet and once we were their it was the wost place to stay in Florence.My husband and myself drove down from Zurich. We were tired. It took two house to find the hotel, know one new of it... we thought we were going to stay at a great place. Wrong it was the worst place.We had to look for another place to stay. It took us just one hour to find a better place.I would not recomend Tourist House Liberty to anyone.No elevator, hotel is on second floor, not safe in rooms.the rooms on the internet are not the same in person. All we can say is do not stay there.Also do not eat at the FishRestaurant is was the worst. Food was bad and over priced, services was the worst.

<Content>A dirty, unsafe hotel!!! We were shocked when we arrived at the hotel. There was a veneer of dust all over the room. At least, two lightbulbs were burnt out. There was very little security - no one at the front desk over night. Breakfast is included but you would wish that it wasn't. We had booked the room for three nights on the Internet. When we told the manager that we were leaving after our first night, he was very polite about it. But then he charged us an extra night on our credit card without notifying us that he would do so. We found a wonderful hotel right near the Duomo for a few more Euros for our last three nights and were thrilled.Avoid this dump - it is NOT a bargain and has convinced me never to book online again unless I know the hotel to be reputable. This place was a truly horrible experience.

<Content>Good Value for the Money We stayed at the Liberty House and found the accomodations very good. My wife and I occupied a triple room, which was beautiful. Had a full bathtub. Plenty of room to maneuver around luggage. Only negative was the smell in the entrance off the street that only occured at night time. Not sure if it was the fault of the hotel or blaime could be laid off to the sewage system in Florence.All in all, good value for the money.

<Content>Beautiful Rooms This hotel is the perfect base from which to explore Florence. It is a short walk from the train station and all the must see places in Florence. It is also very close to the market and some great places to eat. Our room was small but beautifully decorated and the price was very reasonable.If we were going back to Florence again we would stay here again.

<Author>MichiganTraveller
<Content>Somewhat disappointed. Website overstated rooms. The best thing about Tourist House Liberty was Alessandro Fiore, the offsite Internet Reservations Agent. Alessandro was extremely helpful with answering questions prior to our arrival and for arranging tickets to the museums. Alessandro deserves a five-star excellence rating for his services. With regard to the hotel, we found the entrance disappointing. In fact, when we entered the building from the street I stepped back outside to make sure I was in the correct building. The entrance needs an extreme makeover. Room size doesn't bother us because we're there to see the sights, not a hotel room however, ants by the dozens do bother me. I left a note, written in Italian, for the day manager about the ant problem in our bathroom. That evening when we returned to the room I asked the night manager if the ant problem was taken of. The manager told me no problem. Our request for help went unanswered. I should have contacted Alessandro!The halls and rooms tend to be dark due to inadequate lighting or maybe it was just our side of the building and our room that was dark however, for a rather inexpensive stay this hotel will do. Make note...this establishment does not accept credit cards for payment. So make sure you have plenty of cash on hand.

<Content>It's average A friend and I had stayed here recently. The hotel is conveniently located 15 mins away from the train station, 10 mins away from the San Lorenzo market and 15 mins away from the Duomo. Location wise, this is great. Once inside the room, we found it small, so small, it was difficult to maneuvre around the bed. Either the luggage had to be moved or another person had to move out of the way. There was little room around the toilet too! Shower was OK. We had no issues with the hot water. The upsides of this place were the budget price, the view outside from the window, and a computer down the hall for free Internet. For an average budget hotel, I would recommend this other single travellers and couples.

<Author>bpatrick77
<Content>Terrible!!! We booked only one night here, because the Il Villino was booked on our last night in Florence, and the reviews thus far have all been pretty positive. The location of the hotel is not too bad, especially when you are catching the train the next day, because it's a short walk to the station. Like another reviewer stated... the pictures are very flattering. All in all, it was a lower priced hotel, so I shouldn't have expected too much, and the hotel would get a much better review from me, but there were a couple of problems... #1 - Absolutely no hot water in our bathroom. I can understand some of the hotels that have limited hot water, but we had absolutely none. #2 - Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I see nowhere on the website that says that they are cash only... In fact, they took a credit card when I made my reservation. I just think if they only accept cash it should clearly be stated, because if I had known that I might have booked somewhere else. Anyway, that's my 2 cents...

<Content>Great budget accomodation I and my mother stayed at this hotel twice: in November 2003 and November 2004. The first time we had a double room with a WC and the second time - a double room with shared facilities.Rooms were clean and quite spacious, but the furniture was rather inconvenient and generally unsuitable for a hotel. Audibility between rooms is quite good - we heard other guests coming and leaving, but the hotel is so small (7 rooms or so), that it is not a problem.The hotel is about 10 minutes walking from the railway station, which is not very central, but not far either. It takes about 15-20 min walking to get to the center of Florence (e.g. to Santa Maria del Fiore), which is ok, provided that you leave the hotel in the morning and don't return untill the night.The owner (Allesandro) is a very courteous and pleasant person - he has litrally saved us on the second visit, when our reservation with another hotel did not wok out.All in all this hotel provides a clean and reasonably priced budget accomodation that is central enough. I recommend it.

<Content>A Hotel that deserves a much better position in the top Tourist House Liberty is located in a very convenient part of Firenze, away enough from the rail station(12 minutes walking) in order to do not have any problems during the evening hours; we considered that the rail way station area was the worst in Firenze from the point of view of the atmosphere and safety.We stayed on the right-side of the Hotel in a VERY SPACIOUS room, clean and comfortable, excellent beds (not squeaky); we had a small fridge in the room which was very useful.An excellent manager -Alessandro- who is VERY ATTENTIVE and VERY HELPFUL. If you want to have a breakfast in your room it may be obtained for 6 Euro/person. Free coffee is provided every morning at the reception. 5 minutes walking from Academia Gallery, and 18-20 to Uffizzi. Close to a lot of useful stores:Il Centro-4 minutes, 5 minutes from the Market., 5 minutes from a good restaurant Garibardi (not with L), 20 minutes from 4 Leoni and maybe 25 (Pza Santa Croce -the EXCELLENT Tratoria Baldovino. In our opinion, a very good return for our money. You just must be aware that after 5 P.M, there is no Reception. All the people are nice, some language barriers may appear.Next time, we will definitely go to the same place. We paid 100 Euro/night for 3 people.

<Content>Great website but okay rooms We were slightly hesistant when we arrived- the hotel is dark and the lobby smelt of cigarettes and it reminded me of an immigrant waystation. The budget room offered over the net for 52 euro was small but clean, but we decided to go with an en-suite when we got there- it was 70 euro. The bathroom was clean and attractive and the room had nice view to a small garden. The furniture was nice looking BUT the bed was a rickety metal frame squeaking loudly at the slightest movement or (I kid you not) breathing. I HATED the bed and it was not conducive being on a honeymoon. We considered moving the next night but it was too expensive. THe next day, the smoke had cleared in the lobby and the travelers looked less forlorn. I really believe all this place needs is brighter lights in the lobby, to get rid of dusty and wilty dried flowers in the hallway and to improve the beds.

<Content>This place is basic but good The hotel is on the 1st floor of a tall, older building and it might help you to know that it does not have a lift for visitors use (there is a lift but it's for another hotel on a higher floor). There's not too many steps anyway. It's fairly dark inside and I would say that the pictures on the website are very flattering! My overall opinion is that this hotel is basic but good. It's a cheap price and you are close to the train station and all the major sights (easy walking distance to everything) - particularly the academy where you can see Michael Angelo's David. Our room was clean but with nice antique furniture (squeaky beds). If you are next to a shared bathroom it can be noisy at night. I would close the window shutters in the day to keep the heat out of the room at night. There is no breakfast here but you can pay 6 euros to have it delivered from the cafe up the road! We were able to leave our bags in the reception after check-in which was really handy.

<Content>nice, clean and good location in reasonable price Tourist House Liberty is a great place for those who are looking for a nice place to stay without the need of hotel facilities such as hair dryer, TV, bar etc. We took a standard room which was quite big, very clean with a private clean bathroom and a safe. the location is perfect: 5-10 minutes from all sites and railway station. The management is very friendly (english speakers) and the place is beautifully decorated, well kept (white sheets and shiny toilets) and very cozy. It was so much better than all poor hotel which were offered to us in double price and bad location. the street is very noisy during the day, but gets quiet by night. Also, we visited Florence on October, so I can't say anything about air conditioning - needs to be considered if going on summer time.
