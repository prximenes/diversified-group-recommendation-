<Content>Good Value Four of us - 2 adult couples - stayed at the Hispanos 7 Suiza (H7S) for 8 nights 12/28/08 - 1/6/09. The hotel is about 10 blocks from the center of Barcelona, but a subway is easily available. (Ten rides cost less than 8 Euros and rides can be shared.) The hotel is 5 floor high and consists of 2 bedroom, 2 bath apartments. There is a front desk that's staffed 24/7. A free breakfast (cold cereals, yougurt, fresh fruit, pastries and breads, juice, and beverages) is provided in the upscale restaurant on street level. The apartment is about 400 sq. feet. There's A long living room with a separate kitchen area at one end. The appliances are modern (d/w, built in oven, 2 burner range top, undercounter refrig,. with small freezer, microwave, toaster, and washer/dryer). The furniture is basic - upholstered coach and easy chair, small TV, glass top dining room table for 4. The living room - kitchen is about 11ft wide x 20 ft long. There are 2 small bedrooms, about 10 ft x 10ft. (Each has its own closet with hanging space, shelving, and drawers.) One has a queen bed, the other has twin beds. (The twins can be pushed together.) There's a hall bathroom (small tub with hand-held that doesn't mount on a wall) bidet, toilet, sink and lots of mirrors. We assigned that bath to one couple. The other bath is attached to the twin-bedded room. It has a small shower, toilet, and sink. It's tight, but it's certainly functional. The apartment has it's own heating and a/c system. It worked well. There's also a front balcony - probably 11 ft x 3.5 ft. There were a couple of problems. Thin doors and walls make privacy within the apartment an issue. One can also hear conversations in the adjoining unit - but this wasn't as serious as it may sound. There are supermarkets around the corner and places with prepared foods within a block or two. We didn't prepare meals but it was convenient to have cooked food and drinks available. The place was small for 4, but it suited our purposes. The modern bathrooms and kitchen were far from depressing. The rate was 230 euros a day plus a 7% tax. That's reasonable for 2 couples. We were there during an expensive time period. My guess is that discounts are readily available at other times of the year.. We found H7S a good alternative to a 4 star hotel. And during this holiday season, two rooms at a 4 star hotel would have cost significantly more.

<Content>Great hotel, great location 3 night stay in Oct. '08 .Friendly  helpful staff, great rooms ( in need maybe of a little modernisation) . Breakfast buffet was included in room rate  was an additional benefit, never too busy  whilst variety was limited the quality of the food was good.Overall a very good stay , can't fault it.

<Content>Fantastic Accommodations and the Best Service Staff Reviewer: Trip Advisor Member, Ohio, USAWe stayed at Hispanos 7 Suiza while in Barcelona before our Mediterranean cruise. We were a 3 generation family travelling and it was difficult finding lodging in Europe for 5 people (my elderly mother, my husband and I with a teenager and a younger child). I chanced upon this wonderful hotel which offers very spacious 2 and 3 bedroom apartments with the same amount of bathrooms. It had a balcony in our living room and a fully equipped kitchen. The decor was classic with modern touches. The hotel is so clean and the breakfast that is included is excellent. The hotel staff arranged for our airport pick-up, tour of the city , restaurant meals and port transfer. The staff is so helpful and it felt like home away from home. It was a great experience and I would definitely stay at this hotel again when in Barcelona. It's around the corner from Sagrada Familia, Barcelona's most famous landmark by Gaudi.

<Content>Great for families Located just by the Sagrada Familia (though you won't see it from most apartments), this hotel is a short metro ride from Passeig de Gracia/the Ramblas.The apartments are relatively spacious (for a smallish couple with smallish kids) and comfortably furnished (neither at the cutting edge of design nor chintzy) with airco, full kitchen (fridge, hob, washing machine, dishwasher, etc.), living room, terrace, two bedrooms (one with twin beds, the other with a double) and two bathrooms (one with shower, one with bath, both with toilet), which speeds things up no end when preparing to go out. The beds are comfortably firm.The breakfast buffet offered a fair amount of choice: croissants, fresh fruit, cold meats, cheese, bacon and scrambled eggs, doughnuts, tarts (even cava for those who can face it at breakfast). The breakfast room is large and the tables offered lots of elbow room.The reception staff were unfailingly charming and helpful. The hotel restaurant was closed for August but looked like it might actually be quite good.We were very happy with our choice and would gladly return.

<Content>Family accomodation in Barcelona Stayed for 5 nights in August, 2 adults and 3 children in 2 bedroom apartment. Location is just around the corner from Sagrada Familia so handy for the metro and the tourist bus, plenty of restaurants in walking distance including an all you can eat buffet which my children thought was a great idea! (actually quite nice food and fairly healthy choices). Also 2 supermarkets, a fruit shop etc within a 2 minute walk.The apartment has a double and a twin bedroom- the extra bed was in the living room which was a bit cramped as a result but still much more spacious than a hotel room. There is a fully functioning kitchen- have to admit, I didn't use the cooker but did use the washing machine a couple of times.The balcony overlooked the street, there is good air conditioning.Breakfast was really good with a great choice of breads, fruit and a selection of cakes each morning- (also bacon/ scrambled eggs and some little hot dog sausages )It was very hot when we stayed and it would have been good to have had a swimming pool on site- you do get free entry into the gym around the corner and they have quite a big indoor pool but I'm not sure if we could have brought the children there. Fairly pricey but very comfortable. Friendly staff on reception and clean.

<Content>Fantastic Place!!! We only stayed two nights. But it is was a welcome break after travelling by ferry and train for three days.Very friendly and helpful staff who went the extra mile. The rooms were spacious and clean, it was very handy to have a washing machine. We found the apartment to be very quiet on a night for some much needed sleep. Our two children loved old cars and the breakfasts were fab.

<Content>Great family accommodations in Barcelona Hispanos 7 Suiza is a great place for families in Barcelona. Our groups of four stayed for three nights -- myself, my husband and our 13 and 10 year old daughters. There was plenty of room for us and we never felt crowded. The kitchenette was helpful, as we ate a couple of meals in to save a little money. Breakfasts, included in the price, were very good. I found the hotel to be clean throughout and the front office staff was extremely helpful at all times. We loved staying in the quieter Eixample area of Barcelona, as it gave us a break from the crowds at the end of the day. I would highly recommend this hotel to any family looking for accommodations in Barcelona.

<Content>Highly recommend Hispanos 7 Suiza I chose this hotel because of TripAdvisor reviews and so want to pass on the favor. For us, it was perfect - not fancy, but very clean and welcoming and a very good size apartment (we were 2 adults and 1 teenager). The location was great - a real neighborhood, which I think made our Barcelona experience much better than staying downtown or in a tourist district. We did a lot of people watching, which was fun. We also enjoyed being so close to La Sagrada Familia - we never took the tour, because the lines were so long, but we got to see it regularly from all angles. The hotel is very close to a metro stop which includes 2 subway lines, and the metros in Barcelona run amazingly frequently - we literally never had to wait more than 3 minutes. The staff at the hotel were great - very friendly. We stayed 4 nights, then left for a couple of days and returned for our final night. They let us leave some of our luggage behind (with no charge). When we returned to the hotel it was like coming back home to a familiar and welcoming place.

<Content>Wonderful place for families Our family of six just returned from a one week stay and we liked this 'aparthotel very much. Location was good (close to the subway, close to a supermarket and Starbucks, and there were a couple of decent restaurants within blocks). Staff was absolutely wonderful (incredibly helpful with reservations, assistance with planning outings, etc.) and the place is very clean and attractively furnished. Our four kids (ages 11 and 13)loved it. Our only complaint was that we could smell a faint odor of smoke, despite the fact that the place is nonsmoking--my guess is that it's from the restaurant or perhaps the staff, and it wasn't terrible, just noticeable. Since we all have asthma and cannot stand smoke, and it didn't bother us very much, I wouldn't worry about it ,but I thought it worth mention.We took the walking tour of the gothic section, loved it, went to a soccer match, which was tons of fun, and dined at several staff-recommended restaurants that we loved. One suggestion--the Palace of Music tours book several days in advance, so book that in advance or immediately after you arrive. It's very worthwhile. Finally, do take extra precautions against theft in Barcelona--my wallet was stolen by a pro at a subway stop--so do as we did and use the safe for cash and passports, taking only what you need for the day with you.

<Content>Very good For some reason recent reviews have caused this aparthotel to fall down the list. I can't see why.I travelled with my parents, reasonably fussy seventy-somethings and they were more than happy. The rooms are spotless, housekeeping is efficient, the public spaces are unique and interesting.Breakfast (included) in the main room was peaceful, with large tables, plenty of space and a large selection of mostly cold foods.The clientele was mostly families as the layout of the rooms dictates this - a double bed, and two singles in the smallish second room, therefore not really suited to friends sharing.Reception was always polite and helpful with restaurant bookings.The only possible downside to this accommodation is the location - it is not in the epicentre of the city. If you are coming to Barcelona for a short weekend you may want to be closer to the action (i.e. restaurants and cafes). If staying for longer it is an advantage to be in an area that is more peaceful on the street, and with the opportunity to see the Sagrada Familia (1 minute away) lit up each night.That said, travel options are plentiful with a couple of metro lines nearby (3 mins) and buses leaving from beside the SF that will take you into town and the Port Vell area (number 19) or to Montjuic (number 50). Numbers 43 and 44 will take you to Paseig de Gracia. You can be in the centre of things in 15 mins.In summary absolutely no complaints, and highly recommended for families or long, long weekends.

<Content>A Nice Family Choice Stayed with our family of 5 and was happy with the accomodations. Although not posh, it more than met our needs. The location adjacent to the Sagrada Familia and proximity to the subway made it an ideal choice for us. Made it easy to beat the crowds to the Sagrada Familia. Never did get the internet to work though. A nice break from typical hotels for our family. Breakfast was included which was a nice feature. Not a bargain though.

<Content>Ok but not great We just returned from Barcelona and the Hispanos 7 Suiza. From other reviews we thought it would be a quite elegant and posh accommodation but it was not. The hallways for example have dirty looking walls like in a 2 star hotel. The apartment itself was nicely decorated though. We had the so called Royal Suite at the top floor so we did not hear much noise from other people. The view from the large balcony is not nice though. Many rundown apartment buildings. The bar area of the hotel was always deserted. It is a long and narrow room which overall has no nice and comfortable feel to it. The breakfast room has a very high ceiling and is bright but has no outside windows. Although non smoking smoke came in from an adjacent room. The breakfast selection was quite good for Spanish standards. The thing we really did not like about the Hispanos was the area the hotel is in. The Hispanos is situated on the edge of the Eixample district. Although the Eixample is a very nice upscale area close to the Sagrada Familia it gets more and more boring, nothing upscale any more. Many ugly newer apartment buildings line the streets, only very few of those nice modernist buildings the Eixample is famous for. Next time I wood definately stay closer to Passeig Gracia. It was nice to see the Sagrada at night when returning to the hotel though. Staff at the Hispanos 7 Suiza were always friendly.

<Content>OK for small children This apartment/hotel is in a great area, close to subway and familia sagrada. The actual apt was decent with good cable tv, and spotty internet by DSL (once I got the cable from the front desk and re-configured the computer). The shower in the kids room was great - much better than most Euro hotels.The bad part of all this was the noise from children - the walls are thin, and there are lots of families with kids. Breakfast was decent but in a beautiful room. There was extra charges for lattes from the machine. There was also a smoking room which was too close to the dining area. I wouldn't stay there again unless I had small children.

<Content>Was better than a hotel room Since there were 4 of us, this was a better option than standard hotel rooms. However, the rooms inside the apartment were a little smallish, and there was no furniture on the balcony. Living room area is very cozy for 4. The pictures on their website are definitely the royal suite.Was nice to have a kitchen. There is a convience store across the street and a grocery store up the hill around the corner. We bought excellent food at the Boqueria Market for dinner a few times. The hotel is a short walk to the Sagrada Familia and the Metro, but there is nothing else around. Very few restaurants in the area. If you want to feel like you are 'in Barcelona', this is not the place.Breakfast buffet was nice with a lot to choose from. However, they added on an unreasonable charge which I did not find out about until checkout, and therefore could not even discuss or dispute. The staff was generally helpful, but if you had to rely on English, you might have some communication problems.

<Content>Great family apartment I have read about this apts from trip advisor. And with no surprise, all that has been said is true. An excellent choice for family with children as the apt has 2 bed rooms, 2 bath rooms.Great breakfat buffet. Just want to point out some things tho they are not big deals for us:-we heard some noises from the upstair apt.-eventhough the location is great, there are no good restaurants around except the one from the hotel. So when you're travelling with a baby, it's not easy to take a metro at night just to find nicer restaurants in the center.Highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>A family gem As many have said, the location so close to the Sagrada Familia, the Hop On Hop Off bus and public transportation was ideal for our family of four. When we arrived by Metro from the airport it was a straight shot in a taxi to the hotel and cost us 11 euros. We took our chances and walked in without a reservation - not that I'd recommend this during tourist season! - we got a rate that was 100 euros less than the advertised price! I had a printout of a price through one of the last minute dot com sites (printed out the night before in an airport hotel) and showed this to the front desk, so they honored the price and took an addtional 20 euros off. The added tax/service charge that we weren't aware of until checkout did raise the total though.  Do not stay in room #101. The double rooms and double bathrooms were wonderful, kitchenette and sitting area were great but the NOISE was awful! Hence the great price? We had the 'thump,thump' of the bass from the music down below in the restaurant and children above us practicing what sounded like tap dancing till LATE into the evening. My kids were exhausted from two nights of no sleep (there is a reason I travel with ear plugs). The kitchenette came equiped but without soap and they don't do the dishes for you. It's the first place we've stayed where there was a washing machine for your clothes in the kitchen. The breakfast spread was GREAT, which even included self-serve wine... we wondered about that, and the kids had plenty to choose from. The staff were terrific, helpful in making suggestions, calling taxis, restaurants, etc. without hesitation. If you can afford it, or get a deal like we did, I'd highly recommend it, we'd stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Good choice for 7 night stay My husband and two children (ages 19  20) stayed at the Hispanos Suizas over the Christmas holidays and picked the hotel largely based on the fact that it had two bedrooms and two bathrooms which was less expensive than getting two rooms at most other hotels. We also enjoyed having a sitting area to relax after a long day of sight seeing. We didn't use the kitchen except to keep a few snacks and bottles of wine. I did like having a washer/dryer, although it was a bit musty so we only washed blue jeans - nothing delicate. I also had a hard time figuring out how to work the machine but that may have just been me. One thing that surprised me was that the hotel charged for everything in the kitchen (from tea towels to dishwasher detergent). I bought some laundry soap at the supermarket and didn't use anything other than wine glasses. This may be typical in Europe (in Canada a kitchen would be fully equipped for no extra charge) so I won't portray it as a negative, just something to note. Having breakfast included was a bonus, with a selection of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, cheeses, breads etc. After a few days it was a bit repetitive, as it always is in these circumstances, but there are alot of options at nearby cafes if you wanted a bit of variety. The waiter in the restaurant was very pleasant. Probably the biggest negative was that our room (number 102) was very noisy, largely due to a crying baby who must have been staying directly above us. The rooms were cleaned every day to a reasonable standard. The front desk staff was very helpful and professional. We only used public transport once, to go to a football game at Camp Nou and otherwise walked everywhere, including Parc Guell, Barcelonetta, the Port etc. We enjoyed this as it justified all the eating and drinking but may be a bit much for young children or the less able. The smoking in Barcelona is hard to take if you're a non smoker so it was nice that the hotel had a no smoking policy in the rooms which it seemed to adhere to. All in all, the Hispanos Suizas met our expectations and I would happily recommend it, particularly for families.

<Content>Breakfast and a balcony too! We had a 2 bedroom suite. Both had their own bathroom - good for my mother and me. My husband enjoyed the balcony and the view from the 5th floor. The suite was spotless and spacious. Service was warm and helpful. The breakfast was vast and was available till 11.00am, great for the late risers (us). We took a taxi from the airport for roughly 30 Euro. The area felt very safe, we had decided not to stay close to La Rambla. The metro was 2 blocks away, right beside the Sagrada Familia church which blew us away every time we passed by. I loved it. Three of us were able to come back from a long day of sightseeing, eating and shopping and lounge comfortably. We paid about 230 Euros / night for the 2 bedrooms which would have slept 4. Whole hearted recommendation here.

<Content>Great family accommodation Just back from 3 nights in Barcelona. We stayed here on the strength of the tripadvisor reviews and are happy to add our own positive review as the place was wonderful. The suite we had was nicely furnished with a double room and twin room, 2 bathrooms and a nice sitting area as well as a kitchenette and balcony. It was also really comfortable and quiet. The staff were friendly and the breakfast was spot on. The real advantage was the location - just round the corner from the Sagrada Familia and metro stop. We got a taxi to and from the airport (around 25 euros each way).As others have mentioned, there is a little Polish convenience store almost directly across the road from the hotel (open on Sundays) and you can stock up on water, snacks etc there. While we were there, we enjoyed the bus tour (which goes out past the Sagrada Familia). We also had two lovely meals, one in Bella Napoli which is off Ave Para-lel and the other in Aqua, on the new seafront, as well as a just-ok meal in the Pizza Express (not called that but the logo's the same) at the Sagrada Familia.

<Content>Lived up to the high expections! This place is as wonderful as described by fellow Tripadvisors! It contains everything one needs for a self-catering holiday. Plenty of supermarkets around. Reception was great with recommendations. Internet service was free, and as we had our own laptop, they just provided us with the cords. And being so close to the Sagrada Familia means that we avoided the peak hours. I loved and place and would go back again.

<Content>Absolutely fabulous! I always go by the reviews on Trip Advisor; 9/10 cases they are spot on!! Again, Hispanos 7 Suiza is no exception. Booked 3 nights at this apartment hotel after reading the rave reviews here.And I was overjoyed when I arrived with my parents, tired and worn out after a long delay with flights and taxi journey, to find that the front of the hotel is really nice with big lights and full glass walls, which made us feel very safe (plus it's a lot easier to find home in the dark after too much sangria!). Friendly and helpful staff, esp. the 2 staff on our departure date. Offered to book us a taxi and kept our luggages (as we weren't leaving until the evening and check-out time is noon) without any prob.Apartment itself is massive. Lovely balcony, good-sized kitchen with everything - washing machine, dishwasher, fridge etc, living/dining room, 2 bedrooms (1 en-suite) plus a large bathroom. Massage shower in en-suite bathroom and a large bathtub in the other. So nice to sit outside in the balcony after a long day.Our rates inc breakfasts. Again, fantastic. Lots to choose (hot and cold meat, eggs, bacon, bread....). We dined at the cafeteria area which is downstairs of their top restaurant, with vintage cars everywhere. Felt very posh!Location is unbeatable. Literally 100 yards from Sagrada Familia, L5 and L2 metro lines and the Bus Turistic stop. Lots of restaurants around. Area is residential and felt very safe, although there were 3 of us!Will definitely stay here again whenever I visit Barcelona.

<Content>Nice but..... We are a young married couple and we had our 6 month old son with us and my parents joined us for a week. The hotel is in a very nice and safe area. The Sagrada Familia church is literally across the road and there are a huge variety of good relatively inexpensive restaurants nearby. It is a 30 minute walk into the main square in Barcelona.The bedrooms were lovely and it was great to have 2 bathrooms. The dining room/sitting room was quite small but was nicely decorated. The kitchen smelt of dampness and this wasn't the nicest place to relax in as a result. The staff could not have been nicer and helped us when we couldn't get our computer to work on the freely available internet access in each room.It was quite expensive (220 euro per night) but then again most accomodation of a good standard is in Barcelona.Would I stay here again? Probably not. There are hotels in the Barcelona suburbs that are better and a lot less expensive. It's a nice hotel but I certainly wouldn't consider it plush.

<Content>A little gem Spent 5 nights Hispanos 7 Suiza and cannot fault it for wonderful comfortable rooms. Staff very helpful. Location excellent very close to Sagrada Familia. Little Polish shop across the street selling groceries so you can buy milk etc for your early morning coffee/tea in your room. Breakfast is very standard - mostly sweet pastries. Setting for breakfast is lovely with vintage cars set out around the room. Quiet, clean, a home from home. So impressed was I, that I;m going back in April with some girlfriends. First time I stayed was with hubby and two children and we absolutely loved the experience. Dont let this one pass you by.......you wont be disappointed. I'm very fussy and it ticked all the boxes...

<Content>Loved this hotel -- perfect for families We just returned from a week in Barcelona, where we split our time between the Hispanos 7 Suiza and the Hotel Arts. We loved the H7S and highly recommend it.First, the space was invaluable. 2 BRs, kitchen, 2 baths... more than plenty of room to spread out. It compared well to a timeshare or residence club (without the pool). As a family of 4 (2 young kids) it was nice to have a clothes washer in the unit as well.The on-site restaurant was nice. Breakfast was included in our rate, and while not amazing it was a great way to start the day. We ate dinner at La Cupula one evening and loved it -- very high-quality food.We enjoyed the location. The kids loved seeing La Sagrada Familia every day as we headed to the Metro station. We also enjoyed being in a residential neighborhood.The staff were friendly and accommodating. Most of the other guests seemed to be visiting from other parts of Spain, and they were friendly as well.When we return to Barcelona, we will most definitely return to the H7S!!!

<Content>Home away from home This aparthotel was fabulous. Located just a block from Sagrada Familia and the metro, it was a great home base. Walking to the metro alone at night is not recommended, but if you are with another person or in a group it is fine. There is a grocery store around the corner -- the area dining isn't great, but for a quick coffee it worked well. The staff was very helpful and spoke great english. Our room included 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a living room area, kitchen (with dishwasher, washing machine, stove), and back patio (overlooking the backs of apartment buildings; one included a naked man sunbathing). If you are looking for a good place to settle in for a while this is a comfortable place that is very clean. Definately recommend it!

<Content>Great Find It's a great deal for the price. We had a 2 bedroom, 2 baths apartment, with a small kitchen, and a washer-dryer machine (it was a bit loud, so I wouldn't run it at night). The location is great: 2 min. from the Segrada Familia, metro station, some small restaurants and bars, and even a grocery store. The staff at the hotel were nice and helpful. A wonderful place for a family. One thing to keep in mind-- it is a little bit away from the old city and other attractions, but it only takes 3 metro stops to get there, and with metro being just around the corner, this wasn't an issue at all. Overall - we would stay there again with no reservations.

<Content>Fab location and accommodation Have recently returned from the Hispanos Suiza and must say was very impressed both by the location (walking distance of Sagrada Familia) and the standard of the accommodation on offer .It was very clean, tidy and of a very good standard of upkeep. The staff were friendly and courteous and eager to help if possible.The only small downside might be the overactive cleaning staff who seem to start their chores about 8am !!!That said, would go back and would not hesitate to recommend.

<Content>Great value, accomodating staff, but location could be better My husband, 13-year-old daughter, and I just returned from a four day stay at Hispanos 7 Suiza and were very pleased with our stay at the hotel. The staff accommodated our need for early morning check-in without hesitation (we had disembarked from a cruise and desperately needed some rest). Throughout our stay the staff was very pleasant and helpful, doing their best to assure that we had an enjoyable experience in Barcelona.The unit we stayed in had 2 bedrooms, 2 baths, a small, well-equipt kitchen (dishwasher, refrigerator, pots, pans, dishes, utensils -- even a washing machine), and a terrace. The unit was clean, comfortable, fresh, and nicely decorated. The unit had all the appointments that would be expected in a luxury hotel. We stayed in a rear-facing unit that got plenty of sunlight, but had a relatively unpleasant view (a courtyard facing the backs of many apartment buildings in various stages of repair and a school that at times became noisey when the children were playing outside). If this would be a significant issue to you, I would suggest requesting a front-facing unit at the time of booking.Our daughter absolutely loved the apartment style layout/feel of the hotel. In fact she much preferred it to the (much more expensive) luxury hotel where we stayed before our cruise.The location was a bit of a disappointment. The property is located one block from the Sagrada Familia, where the very popular Barcelona Bus Turistic stops, however the bus line is a one way circular route and we found that we would have to ride the entire route to get to the other must-see sights that we most wanted to visit. The neighborhood is newer than most other parts of the city and did not have the same feel as the most of the other parts of city that we visited. For me this was the only significant drawback in staying at this property.All in all this hotel was an exceptional value and is perfectly designed to suit the needs of families who would otherwise need to book multiple rooms to accomodate their needs.

<Content>Fabulous Cozy Hotel in Bustling Barcelona This small boutique hotel offers apartment style rooms with small kitchenettes. It was clean and spacious, and looks as if it has been recently renovated. It is located on a quiet resedential street less than one block from Gaudi's Sagrada Familia Chapel. The staff spoke English and were very knowledgeable and helpful.

<Content>Great Hotel and Location My husband and I recently returned from our stay at the Hispanos 7 Suiza and were very pleased with the accomodations. The location is very convenient to the Sagrada Familia and a tourist bus stop. The staff were very helpful and easily conversed in English. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. I had read that noise can be a problem in Barcelona but I found our room to be quiet. Having a comfortable room to return to each day added to the enjoyment of our trip.

<Content>Great hotel, staff and location Hispanos 7 Suiza is a wonderful hotel. Our immaculate 2 bedroom and 2 bathroom apartment suite was tastefully decorated, with a view of the Sagrada Familia. As mentioned by other reviewers, the hotel's location is very near the Sagrada Familia as well as several markets which stay open late. The concierge was very, very helpful to us, recommending a wonderful inexpensive tapas restaurant within walking distance. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the Barcelona area.

<Content>Spacious suite great location Just returned from my second visit to Barcelona and my first to this hotel. I would really recommend this hotel for a group or a family. I booked it as my Mum was coming with me and my husband and I wanted two decent sized rooms with space to sit and relax between sight seeing. Having read all the previous reviews I chose this hotel and was not disappointed. The service was excellent, the rooms very clean and spacious. The beds were comfortable as well which is a bonus in a hotel.The location was good just around the corner from the Sagrada familia so we could see it at diffent times of the day and evening. What a spectacular sight to return to after a day out!!The staff could not have been more helpful and pleasant. The breakfast was adequate but at 6 euros was reasonable value. The display of vintage cars in the breakfast room made an interesting scene to have my morning coffee. I would book here again next time I visit Barcelona.

<Content>great for families We stayed here for 4 nights in april. 2 adults, 3 children. they provided an extra bed and it worked perfectly. having the 2 bedrooms was excellent. 2 bathrooms very useful. front desk very nice, booked us a taxi at the end of our stay to the bus station. well located near metro station and a good supermarket for essentials first turning right outside hotel. like said before t 10 for metro is best it covers all family not just an individual. we went to the sagrada familia about 5pm and walked straight in no queues, but it was right on our doorstep. breakfast good. if i had any complaint for paying 270 euros plus tax a night i would have expected our beds to be made but this was charged at an extra cost.

<Content>Nice small hotel We stayed at Hispanos Siete Suizas in late April 2007. It was a nice pleasant small hotel, service was very friendly at the front desk, they were quite accommodating. I asked it they had wireless internet, and they said no but they have ADSL for free and will give you a LAN cord. That was a big hit for me! I upload my photos in the evening and share with my friends and family back home.The suites are smallish, but comfortable, with a sitting area in the living room, and two separate bedrooms with its own bathroom. Rooms are clean and bathrooms are well stocked daily. We stayed on the first floor directly above the restaurant, and there is some residual noise in the evenings since people eat so late here. I would ask for a room higher up if I had to do it again, but we booked last minute and I believe the hotel was full.The restaurant has a very nice ambiance, the food is quite good, our dinner for two with a bottle of wine and a shared dessert came to 85euros. Breakfast in the morning is included in the price of the room, and the buffet is ample, with scrambled eggs, meats, some of the best chocolate croissants I've ever had outside of France! The neighborhood around Sagrada Familia is a little less nice than some of the other areas, Barcelona in general is a bit dirty, but the people are very friendly and have alot of pride in their city, so it kind of makes up for the lack of cleanliness outside. Definitely take the Bus Turistic, get a two-day pass that allows you to see most of the city, stops at all the major places. The Metro is extremely easy to use, a 2 day pass costs under 10euros OR you can buy a Barcelona card for 19E that includes entry to some of the museums.I would stay here again if I came back simply because it was clean, friendly, well-priced and included FREE high-speed internet connection - that is a rarity in most hotels today. I've been ripped as much as 10E an hour for a connection!

<Content>excellent for families Read about these apartments at the back of a Barcelona guide book andfollowed it up with reviews from trip advisor. I really cannot think of anything else to say that hasn't already been said. An excellent alternative to a hotel but with all a hotel's facilities. The two bedrooms with two bathrooms works very well for a family of four. Breakfast was great, La Cupola restaurant, superb, staff helpful and courteous and the apartments were excellent. Absolutely no negative points about this accomodation.It takes less than five minutes to Sagrada Familia and the metro. The T-10 ticket is worth buying. Whatever you decide to visit be prepared for some lengthy queues, especially Sagrada Familia. This is the beauty of staying at Hispanos Siete Suiza. You can get there before all the tour buses and believe me there can be quite a few!

<Content>Everything we hoped it would be and more We really couldn't fault these comfortable apartments at all. We picked them because of the excellents reviews and they more than lived up to expectations. To come back after a long day sightseeing and slip your tired feet into the slippers provided was a nice touch.The location by La Sagrada Familia suited us and we travelled mainly by metro and on foot. We felt safe using the metro even at night.As a family of 4 with two teenagers we all enjoyed Barcelona and really loved the apartments. Having two bedrooms and two bathrooms was ideal. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend staying here. The staff on Reception were always extremely helpful.

<Content>Ideal for a family of 4 or or two couples I chose this aparthotel on the basis of tripadvisor reviews and was not disappointed. My wife and I took our Mothers for the weekend of 17th and 18th March (it being Mothers Day). We stayed only one night with the aim of spoiling them so the main aims were to stay somewhere that felt luxurious and to have an area to chill in before the evening meal and the next morning. And that was exactly what we got at Hispanos Siete Suiza. Having two bathrooms was great, but for us the lounge area was the biggest hit. We also had a balcony with a view of the top of the Sagrada Familia (room 504) which was nice. The apartment was clean and well decorated.We ate at their restaurant La Cupula on the Saturday evening and had the tasting menu (45 euros for six courses) which I thoroughly recommend. It's a very original setting as well with 1920's cars all around you and a glass-roofed area with trompe l'oeil murals.As for Barcelona itself, Gaudi was a hit with all of us. We went to the Sagrada Familia, Park Guell and La Pedrera all of which all four of us rated very highly. A taxi is best to Park Guell - especially with two ladies in their 70's in the group! - as it's a fair way out of town and at the top of a steep hill. Sagrada Familia is only 100 yards from the hotel, while La Pedrera is two metro stops away.We also went to the Picasso museum but weren't impressed as we're too traditional to appreciate his kind of art. Probably enjoyable if you're into his style though. La Rambla was a disappointment but perhaps it's better in the Summer. The T-10 is definitely the best ticket for getting around. Ten trips for 6.90 euros, and multiple people can use it.Beware of pickpockets and bag-snatchers - a girl tried to take my wallet from my pocket on the metro, and about an hour later (despite taking care) my mother had her bag snatched in one of the small roads just off La Rambla. A lad of about 16 pushed her over, grabbed the bag and was off and gone with it before anyone could react. Lucklily she wasn't hurt though she was shaken by it.

<Content>Home Away from Home - Indeed!!!!! The aparthotel is very comfortable and ideal for a family. Our wood-floored apartment has 2 bedrooms (one double and one with 2 single beds), two bathrooms/toilets (the single beds room has an en-suite), a very well equipped kitchen plus washing machine, and a very comfortable and nicely furnished living/dining room plus a balcony. Needless to say, we were pleasantly surprised. My 11- year old son kept on complementing me for a very good choice of hotel. So, right-right-right et voila!The staffs are very friendly and very helpful, okay there is no porter to help us with the door and the bags but hey, we鈥檒l give those up for the comforts and luxury that the establishment has to offer. Breakfast (or Brunch as they serve until 11h00!!!) is great and has loads of choices for the discerning guests (you can even have a champagne with your breakfast if you wish so).Kitchen came in very handy for us, we have two young kids who are used to eating at about 18h30. Waiting for the restaurants to serve hot food the earliest 20h30 is a bit too late. There are numerous supermarkets around the hotel. There is one right in front of the place 鈥?limited choices and sells no wine, but the best one is just around the corner from the hotel, 2-3 minutes away. From the hotel, turn to your right, continue on until the end of the road and turn right again, the supermarket (the name of which escaped me) is on your right. Although we did not go to the restaurant La Cupula, we heard that it is very good. The chef is a Michelin-starred Catalan chef and is frequented by locals alike. The hotel was a former house originally owned by a Catalan doctor/gynecologist. When his wife died of cancer, he set up a foundation in her memory and parts of the hotel鈥檚 profits go to this cause. So most of their apartments if not all are non-smoking. In summary, I would strongly recommend this hotel to folks who may want to visit Barcelona sometime soon. The Metro stop is Sagrada-Familia and is a 5 minute walk to and from the hotel. The open top hop on/hop off tourist bus also has a stop here.

<Content>Great accommodations - Great Location The Junior suite was comfortable and well stocked. All the furniture and equipment was good quality. The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. The buffet breakfast was a full one and good. The restaurant, though expensive, had excellent cuisine. The Sagrada Famillia and Metro were two blocks away, although we found cabs to be cheap enough that it was only a bit more for the three of us to go to central Barcelona by cab than by Metro. Good grocery shopping and restaurant choices nearby. The cost was probably cheaper for us than two hotel rooms would have been. Internet cafe right around the corner.

<Content>Very pleasant stay It is a nice concept, a luxury hotel with only suites (or apartments). Just round the corner of the Sagrada Familia, so also on walking distance of public transport (metro). I was traveling alone and the area felt very safe, even at night. (Didn鈥檛 like at all the whole Ramblas area, even on daytime!) I stayed here in January 2006 and had an enormous suite all by myself. It had a living room, kitchen (with glass- and tableware but not a coffee/thee maker or many pots and pans), 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. In the whole suite you will find very nice furniture, beautiful bathrooms and luxury in even the smallest details (much quality and design). The staff was friendly and assists full and they all speak English very well. Breakfast was fine, not as much in other European 4* hotels, but for Spanish standards enough to chose from. There is also a bar and a restaurant. In the restaurant you will find many locals to have diner, so when not only hotel guests eat here, you think that it will be very good. I had diner and was very disappointed. Price was high and the quality was low, not only the food was minor also the way the food was presented on the plate was far below expectations.

<Content>Great location, great apartment hotel. My husband, my adult daughter and myself stayed at this hotel the beginning of October, 2006 and loved it. Great location, around the corner from the Sagrada familia and the metro station. Like home, a 2 bedroom apartment with 2 bathrooms , living room and kitchen. Comfortable beds with great shutters on windows for noise free, great sleeping.There is a grocery store right accross the street where you can buy food, water, etc.I strongly recommend this hotel, worth every penny . Great for families or even 2 couples.

<Content>Excelente! Lovely hotel in a nice area, convenient for Metro and Bus Turistic. The apartment format is great for families or friends who aren't couples. Apartments are self-catering but the equipment looked unused, presumably because of the cheap and plentiful opportunities for eating out. Rooms were of a high standard with air conditioning (centrally controlled but you can turn it off), balcony, electric shutters and even a pillow menu! Look on-line for promotional offers - we got a Junior Suite Apartment at half-price which was a real bargain for such luxury. Breakfast was not included but the restaurant had a reasonably priced breakfast buffet or you could have coffee and croissants in the cafe across the road. Front desk staff all spoke good English, but this was by no means the rule elsewhere in Barcelona and you will get more out of your visit by learning a little Spanish.

<Content>Ideal place to stay We stayed here (two adults and two teenagers) in mid August and it is an ideal place to stay. Away from busy areas but convenient to public transport. The Eixample district is built on the grid system with squares of properties built around central courtyards. We had a fourth floor non smoking apartment with a balcony overlooking the rear courtyard, with its terraced gardens and balconies. It was interesting to look out and see people going about their daily lives. There were no out door chairs on the balcony - a couple of sun loungers would have been bliss. There are plenty of food shops, cafes and restaurants around the neighbourhood - ask reception, the staff are very helpful and speak excellent English.The Sagrada Familia was two minutes away with a convenient tourist information kiosk together with metro station and bus stops.The hotel is clean and attractive and daily cleaning is available 9.00am - 2.00pm. The restaurant is closed during August, except for breakfast at 9 euros each and for coffee. Looking at a typical menu for the restaurant most main meals were between 15 - 20 euros.We paid 150 euro but then had to pay an additional 15 euro per teenager per day (odd as the appartment is designed for four people). The apartment was very good; twin room with en suite shower, double with adjacent bathroom with shower attachment, cosy lounge with dining area (table chairs) and a small kitchen area with adequate resources. However, no kettle, oven gloves, sink drainer or chopping board. AC and TV - but only Bloomberg CNN and Euro Sport (with Spanish dubbed over the audible english!!) in English. Hire a DVD player for 5 euro per night but bring your own DVDs.Hints and tips:Buy a five day Barcelona Card for 34 euro which allows travel on all public transport and gives discount on many places to visit.Ask at the information kiosk at Sagrada Familia or inside the metro station.Bus Touristic tickets are 19 - 22 euro for 1 / 2 days but we found the metro quicker and more cost effective.El Trobador restaurant in Carrer de Ferran (off La Rambla) Two course meal for four with drinks and coffees 60 euro.Fresc Co in Carrer del Carme 'all you can eat' buffet plus drinks under 10 euro each (very good quality food)Lactuca in Provenca (next to Sagrada Familia) buffet as above.Tibidabo Fun Park too tame for teenagers, but do visit the church and Collesrola Tower.Montserrat Monastery - get an early train (one hour from B) to hear the choir sing at 12 noon (holy days) or 1.00pm on other days. Last cable car / funicular leaves before the evening choir sing.Must see 'magic fountain' from Placa d'Espanya.Must stroll down La Rambla at night.Pastport often needed if using credit / debit card.Overall an ideal home from home in the city that has it all...

<Content>Perfect for Family! The hotel was exactly what we expected after viewing the photos and information on TripAdvisor. My husband and I stayed with our two teenagers in the 3-BR/2.5 BA Royal Suite and we were all very comfortable. The Master BR was spacious and the bathrooms were wonderful. The oversized balcony with a canopy was also a nice plus. We appreciated having a washer  dryer as we were in the middle of a 2-week vacation in Europe. The location was very convenient to the Metro and the neighborhood seemed very safe. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel My family (2 adults and two teenagers) stayed at the Hispanos 7 both prior to our Mediterranean cruise and when we returned to Barcelona. This is an excellent hotel for a family to lodge in Barcelona. It is both close the metro and Bus Trustic (red route) as well as around the corner from the Sangrasa Familia church. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. All fixtures and furniture was clean and up to date. The staff was excellent. We choose to include the breakfast and loved the variety. We recommend this hotel and would stay there when we return.

<Content>Great Location - Great Place to stay We stayed at the Hispanos for two nights at the begining of May and found it to be an excellent place to stay. The location is ideal, two minutes walk from the Sagrada Familia and the Linea 5 metro station. The hop on hop off tour buses also stop nearby so for us the location was ideal. You can reach any part of the city, yet you are far enough away from the hussle and bussle of La Rambla. Altough we had a balcony over the street it was very quiet at night. The suites were spotlessly clean, modern and fully equipped with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen with some utensils. There was however, no coffee maker. Nearby are a host of shops cafes and restaurants. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the buffet breakfast in the relaxing dining room was excellent. We ate out but I would imagine the meals in the restaurant would have been first class. We got a special deal of 200 euro's per night and this made the stay even better. The rack rate is 400E which may be expensive if only two are staying. All in all and excellent place to stay and highly recommended. The shower incidentally was vibrating fine :-)
