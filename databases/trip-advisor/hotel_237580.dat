<Content>Dont be misled by their website! Please dont be misled by the images on the website for this hotel... the glamorous entrance is just a beam that happend to be there as an architecture for an appartment building... The hotel in fact is located in an appartment building and take the lower three floors of it... The staff makes you feel as though they are doing you a favor by letting you stay and throw instructions at you from the moment you step in... Every morning you will be woken up by the housekeeping yelling and talking amonst themselves in the corridor... I stayed there for 2 nights... and pehaps the worst from my hotel travel experience... On the first morning the housekeeping open the door and walked in while I was getting ready... The hotel breakfast is just terrible and a bare formality of the lowest quality... There is a terrible smell in the room and the full hotel in general... I wold not suggest anyone for this hotel... The Chinese family running the hotel is non friendly and replyies your questions in a tone as though they are annoyed to have you there... No thank you's - just plain instructions is all you get...

<Content>dont do it Yes i had read the reviews but thuought could a hotel of 3 * status be so bad ?? No it was much worse ! The room was so tiny dingy and smelly, odd stains on both bed bases, dirt and blood smeered on the walls wires hanging down in the smallest dirtiest bathroom in the world, i was totally gutted ! I had taken my boyfriend for his 40th birthday as a treat but spent 3 days saying sorry !! The hall ways, carpets stairs filthy i could go on and on, the best advise i could give is DONT STAY AT THE BELFORT, the breakfast that was included didnt make up for the dirty place we had to sleep at all as other reviewers said you can still smoke in pub there so if dont smoke you ended up eating more smoke than toast!Amsterdam is a wonderful place with so so much to see and do we will go back agian no doubt but i would rather stay in the gutter again than the belfort.

<Content>Very sketchy Was it cheap, and clean? Yes, but that's about all I can say for the Belfort.A bit too far out of town, with ancient, vile carpets and wall-hangings, the place is gloomy and not well kept. The rooms are tiny--even by European standards. I've stayed in nicer dormitories, and that's what this place felt like.It is farther out of the city center than I was led to beleive--a 15-20 minute tram-ride, althought service is quick and efficient on these throughout Amsterdam. Too far to walk unless you are in NO hurry, via the Vondelpark on a nice day maybe. But iit s also a short taxi (32-euros!) ride to the airport too.The room was noisy, as were the rather eclectic characters among my fellow clients, some of whom seemed to be there only for, ahem, very short stays. I slept with earplugs and still had difficulty getting any rest.Breakfast was about what you'd expect: coffee, juices, breads and cold-cuts.In short, you can do better elsewhere--and should.If you do get stuck here for whatever reason, try nearby bars called The Bridge, and Cafe Oslo. Both were busy with a fun, mixed crowd.

<Content>Worst hotel I麓ve ever been... I went to Amsterdam with my family (6 ppl, 2 triple rooms booked), and my opinion about belfort hotel is: THANK GOD IT WAS JUST FOR ONE NIGHT!The experience started with a rude staff. We arrived 1h earlier and even with empty and cleaned rooms available they made us wait till the check-in time (14:00). During the waiting time we asked for wi-fi internet access but the answer was: We麓ll give you the code only when you make the check-in! After 1h, we got the keys and wi-fi code. The rooms were 104 and K-4.104: Very tiny room with 3 single beds, tiny bathroom, tiny TV, have no air circulation (the windows doesn麓t open), but at least it was properly cleaned.K-4: Located on the basement, hard access if you麓re carrying big cases (no elevators). Comparing to 104, it麓s a bigger room with 3 single beds, a big bathroom, but no hairdryer, no phone, no windows, pubic hair on the sheets and full of dust. Absolutely disgusting.Both rooms didn麓t have internet connection as promised on the hotel card (All rooms feature bath / shower / toilet / tv / tel. with internet conn.). The only spot I could use wi-fi was on the bar.Next time in Amsterdam I麓ll stay away from this hotel (i麓m still wondering who gave it 3 star status).

<Content>nice and quiet hotel was ok, some staff good others not so much. Location was outside of the city, however that was what we were after as we did want to meet local people. Great access to town and little cafes in the area. No ac in the room so it made it pretty hot, but tolerable.

<Content>decent budget hotel This hotel was not in the heart of Amsterdam, but it wasn't too far from it. It was an easy walk to some of the busiest squares for going out at night. It was clean and comfortable, but nothing spectacular. There were a few burn marks, probably from smokers, but I guess that's to be expected in Amsterdam. The free breakfast was decent, and at least it was free, a rarity in Europe.

<Content>worst hotel so far this is the first time i have written a review but feel compelled.i visit amsterdam at least once a year and like to try different hotels.this is by far the worse,it has a poor and unattractive location.the room was tiny,you were just able to walk around the bed.the bed was so uncomfortable we struggled to get any sleep.it was clean.i cannot believe this is a three star hotel,how did this pass?we even tried to get another hotel for the second night even though we had already paid in full that's how bad this experience was!

<Content>Good budget hotel I stayed at The Belfort Hotel from 9th Feb 2007 for 3 nights. This hotel is ideal if your looking for somewhere to put your head down and use a base. There is a tram stop right outside which makes it convinient for getting in and out of town- even though they stop at midnight .There is a night bus but I found it easier to get a taxi- approx 20-25 Euros.It takes approx 10-15 minutes to get into the centre on the tram- they run about every 5-10 minutes.If you are expecting a three star hotel -beware - it is more like a high standard hostel. I went with 3 other friends and we are all in our early twentys, so it didn't bother us that it could get quite noisey. Most of the other guests were quite young.Breakfast was good-mostly consisting of cold meats, cheese and bread rolls... but it was nice.Staff were friendly and room was kept clean and towells changed daily.There were safes in the reception area which are free to use.All in all- don't expect luxury but this hotel does tend to come up cheper than most others and if you're on a budget its perfect.

<Content>nice location i just came back from my holiday commencing january 26 ,our first stop was amsterdam and we stayed in this hotel ,we booked triple bed,the location was excellent with tram,quite environment,nice foods for bed and breakfast,nice service,reception staff are approachable and helpful,the only problem was the room given to us 1 double deck bed and single bed and that room was in between the other rooms for groups,unfortunately for the first 2 nights the 2 other rooms was with lads (4 each rooms)they made our nights horrible due to banging of doors(unconsiderate)what a coincidence they come from england,drunk as usual going back to their rooms at 2-4 am,though its not the hotels fault,i will recommend this hotel to my friends in the future due mainly to location,to other people going to holiday be considerate to fellow guest.

<Content>Fawlty Towers-eat ur heart out!! The title says it all. Fawlty Towers or Faulty Towers. When we were there have of the building was being done up, it looked a mess from the outside. i would not recommend this hotel. The only good thing about the hotel is that the tram stop was right outside the door.

<Content>Basic but clean I had already booked this hotel when I read the reviews, my first reaction was what have I done. When we arrived and entered our room I was pleasently suprised after all the bad reviews that we had read. The room and the beds were spotlessly clean, the room was cleaned every day that we were there. The hotel although not in the centre has fantastic transport links to the city centre. The only downside we found was if you are not an early riser you will miss out on breakfast, they only seem to place the food out once, when this has gone it is not replaced. The bar is also not fully stocked if you are a shorts drinker. If you want something basic cheap and clean I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Ugly and loud, but clean room The hotel is located in an ugly high rise apartment building which looks quite eastern europe style. There is no airconditioning and the proximity of a big street makes opening the windows a very loud experience.The room at least was clean, had a flat screen TV and it looked like it had just been renovated. The drain in the shower was a bit slow, but in general the room was ok for the price.Breakfast buffet included coffee, juices, rolls and a selection of toppings.I would propably stay there again but just because it is comparatively cheap.

<Content>Definately not recommended I wished that we had read the reports on this hotel before going. It is nowhere near a three star hotel. It is under a block of flats that look run down. Inside is not much better. I don't think our room had been finished off, the carpet up to the rooms leave a lot to be desired, I don't think they have been cleaned in years. Don't expect to hang your clothes up, as the cupboard is about six inches wide. The shower unit was filthy and although they did change the towels each day, the bins never got emptied all the time we were there. On the first night, the young lad on reception was very helpful, but the day after the girl told us that it was only six stops to the centre on the tram, which do run quite often, but if we had got off then, we would still have had a very long walk. Don't expect the bar to be opened, and when it is if you drink vodka, don't bother, cos they have none. When asked for a brandy, I had to go behind the bar and show them what brandy was!!. I could go on and on, but I would be here for days. The final thing if you do stay here, do not book a taxi to the airport through reception. I am sure they must have a deal with them, as they charged us 33 euros, which when we car from the airport cost us 23 euros.

<Content>small but warm place i stayed in this hotel with my friends for 2 days. it is small not like what we have expected, it is more like a family hotel. There are two trams go into the center. It is a bit far away but still convinient.There is only one receptionist in duty, and indeed they are very helpful but too busy with other works. The breakfast is still ok with lots choices. Except all, only the price of the room is a little bit high.

<Content>do not touch this hotel ........not even with a barge pole. We were led up a grubby staircase to our floor. There was no lift. The corridor stunk of smoke. Our room had a big brown stain above the bed head. The toilet smelled damp, the room smelt musty. The lighting was fluorescent strip lighting. There were big ugly pictures on the wall that looked cheap. We told management that we were not satisfied. We were taken to a room across the corridor. This was just the same except it had a slightly better picture.The furniture was chipped. The shower was loose, the grip holding the floor covering was also loose. We got into bed carefully thinking it would collapse as it was very rickety. The tv was a portable on a wall bracket. No sky tv, just terrestrial dutch speaking programmes. Disgusted and embarrassed as this was part of my partner's birthday present. How is this a three star hotel?

<Content>The Most Awful Hotel I am a frequent traveler. I have to say this is the worst hotel that I every stayed at. The room is like a hospital room except the room is VERY dirty. The furniture is full of dust. The table were the TV is on is an old computer table. I had to wiggle the cable on the back of the television to get a clear picture. The bed is uncomfortable and small. Bathroom is dark and unclean. I had to go to the front desk to ask for information about the train and the area but the front desk personnel act like I was bothering her. The staff was not friendly at all. The location of the hotel is not very convenient at all. This hotel does not even deserve a one star. The price of the room is totally not worth it. Even if the room is free, I would not recommend it for anyone.

<Content>Dirty and overpriced We recently had to stay here for one night during the queen's birthday celebration because it was one of the only hotels available. I was surprised that this hotel was rated 3 stars. It was extremely overpriced. The rooms looked like old hospital rooms, the beds were uncomfortable, the bathroom was not very clean, the shower door did not close and there was dust on all of the furniture. The door to the room did not close without slamming it and there wasn't a double lock on the door. The staff was very unfriendly. We did not have towels in our room and finally, after asking multiple times, had to go get them. They were very reluctant to give us more than one towel. We did not stay for the breakfast and left as soon as possible.

<Content>Not even a one star We have just returned from a 4 night stay in Amsterdam where we unfortunately had to stay in the awful Belfort Hotel. As it was the Queens Birthday at the weekend all the hotels in Amsterdam were full so we couldn't leave. I can't say that the staff were rude because other than the receptionist they did not interact with the guests.We paid 鈧?87 for 4 nights in a tiny dirty room that I don't think was cleaned while we were there. The towels were changed every day and the bin was emptied but the beds weren't made. The floor covering was vinyl which was probably a good thing, if it had been carpet I shudder to think what the state of it would be. The carpet on the stairs and on the corridor was very grubby.The windows were not double glazed which was a problem as the hotel is beside a main road and the traffic ran all night.Breakfast was OK and consisted of tea or coffee, croissants, wholegrain or white bread, 3 different cold meats, sliced cheese and two different juices. If you were early enough you could have a slightly warm boiled egg.Needless to say we will not be back and will not be recommending it to any of our friends.

Bedrooms were disgusting, stained toilets with broken seat, shower flooded,stains all over the walls, old fashion metal windows with no double glazing. The hotel is situated next to a main road. Only stayed one night, thank god, this is one hotel tell your friends about. Find another one is my recommadation.

<Content>An awful hovel of a hotel The hotel (The Belfort) surely cannot be rated as 3 star. The hotel was dirty, staff were exceptionally unhelpful, often going out of their way to be unhelpful, miserable and rude. I was in a party of 13 and all of the rooms were in a dreadful state. 2 of the rooms were in the basement (including my own) were flooded and stank of sewage and mould. The whole of the basement corridor was running with an inch of water. We asked to change rooms and were flattly told no with no chance to discuss the matter. My own bathroom toilet was blocked and when flushed the contents came up through the bath and sink. There was evidence of fire damage in my bathroom and the toilet seat was in two pieces. The shower leaked and when used the bathroom flooded to a considerable degree. The whole hotel was a joke from start to finish. There were massive holes in the corridor walls. There was no heating in my room and the double bed had two single duvets on it so myself and my companion were freezing during the night. It was a truly awful experience. Even if the hotel hadn't been flooded it would still not warrant 3 stars, it is threadbare and run down and the staff are appalling. I cannot emphasise enough how truly terrible the hotel was.

<Content>don't waste your money!!! we stayed at this 'hotel' for a week. Service was terrible, staff were grumpy and very unpolite. the room was so small that we hardly managed to move around. they put us in a room for 2 and got two other beds from some other room. no room service and prices for drinks were doubled in price. a soft drink was priced at 3Euro. you can buy drinks from outside the hotel for l.60 euro. bed sheets were never changed during that week and room was never cleaned. breakfast consisted of bread, 3 different cold cuts and juices so you better be early at the breakfast table otherwise they do not re-stock. first come, first served basis at breakfast. I strongly recommend to find another hotel rather than staying at the Belfort.

<Content>disgusting dirty hole This hotel was awful.We stayed as a group of 6 and paid alot for the hotel for what it was.The lobby was scruffy and dingey as so were the rooms, curtain rails hanging from the walls, there were cavities in the walls in which had been stuffed with plastic carrier bags, the bedding was filfthy as were the carpets and furniture, I asked for a refund to pay for another hotel and they blaintently refused, I asked for clean bedding they didnt have any, so we had to stick it for 2 dreadful nights. We went down for breakfast in plenty of time and there was nothing left to eat, we asked the owner for more food and he conveniently didnt understand English (we had to buy breakfast out). It was a hole and I would reccommend that you dont go anywhere near this disgusting hotel!

<Content>Cheap and out of town We booked adjoining rooms for us and our children for one night in March. The hotel is 12 tram stops from central station on no. 1 tram - the only saving grace is that you can get a tram directly to to the hotel and it stops just outside the door.The lobby is dark and dingey and the rooms no better. The bedding appeared clean but the carpets and chair in our room were very badly stained. If we had been booked in for more than 1 night we would have found somewhere else to stay.At night you are very aware of the busy road and trams. The hotel is on the bottom two levels of a residential block and it sounded like the occupants above us were moving their furniture around all night. There is also building work going on on the floors above and on the outside of the building and this started quite early in the morning.On a plus side the continental breakfast was good and there was plenty of food. We had a power cut at b'fast time though due to the building work.The room that it was served in wasn't too bad either.I would say that this hotel is more suited to backpackers and if you want a cheap place to stay, one of the cheap and chearful large chains of hotels is probably better value. At least you know what you are in for. We all had a great time in Amsterdam though and found plenty to do to keep the children amused.

<Content>A little out of town.... This was our 3rd time in Amsterdam and the people we were travelling with were on a strict budget, so we had to go for a cheaper hotel.The Belfort was definitely what I would class as an Economy hotel. The rooms are small and very basic, but spotlessly clean.The Hotel can be reached by trams 1 and 17 from Centraal Station. The number 1 is the more direct route.I found the hotel a little too far out of town for my liking, as I prefer to be more central.The walls were paper thin and if someone was watching TV until 4am (like our next door neighbour), this can be very annoying. The hotel is also on a very busy main road (Surneimaplein) and traffic and tram noise WILL awake you very early!The breakfast is very basic, with cheese some cold meats, bread, juice, coffee and tea. There is one breville toastie machine.For the price, this is a clean and pretty good value hotel. I would advise buying either a 15 trip stripkarten ticket for about 6 euros or an unlimited all-public transport ticket. We bought the 48 hour one for 10 euros and it saved us a fortune! You will trams and buses from this hotel!

<Content>Good value for a few days Stayed here for 3 nights in August, midweek. A bit out from city centre, however the Amsterdam tram service is excellent and there is a stop 1 minute from the hotel. If you get a number 1, it takes about 15 mins to Dam Square.The hotel itself is clean and the reception staff are very helpful. It is pretty noisy however, being next to a main road and crossroads, so if you want an early night you have no chance until after about 12.30am when the trams and traffic dies down.Breakfast is basic but OK. On the whole, good value if you don't intend spending much time in the hotel. There is also a small bistro / bar next to the hotel. The food there is excellent and great value.

<Content>The Belfort Hotel: a good economical choice for those spending a weekend in Amst Myself and two friends stayed in the Belfort Hotel in June of this year. We found it fine for a weekend in Amsterdam. There are very good tram connections to and from the city centre and it is also very easy to get to and from Schiphol airport. However, the trams stop running at around 12.30 at night so you must get a taxi back to the hotel if you have a night on the town. Taxis are relatively expensive but there seemed to be lots available- we had no trouble getting them anyway. The hotel does not look very inviting from the outside (being the bottom two floors of a high rise building)but on the inside is fine. It is decorated in 'ye olde Amsterdam' style and is basic but clean. Our room was a good sized triple and we had a good sized bathroom too. One quibble was that as we were on the ground floor we couldn't open any windows and it did get quite hot at night. Aside from that the room was fine. The staff are helpful and someone is available all of the time in reception. Breakfast was ok not anything special and there did not seem to be facilities for any other meals, although we did not enquire so I may be wrong on this point. The Belfort as we experienced it is a clean basic hotel which would suit anyone in Amsterdam for a short stay who will not be spending much time in the hotel. All in all I would say that it is a good choice for anyone wishing to get a cheap hotel for a weekend and who does not mind being a little bit out from the city centre.
