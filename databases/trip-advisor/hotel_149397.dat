<Content>love the island, beach. NOT THE RESORT!!! Peye. Brampton. Ontario, What a disappointment. Just came back from a week stay at Bavaro Princess, D.R, big disapointment, before booking the trip for nineteen of my family, I read the reviews on this resort,some were good and some were bad, since it is a Five Star resort, we are not very picky peaple, and have traveled to Punta cana many times before and always had a great time, we stayed at B.P from Dec/18?2008 to Dec/25/2008 , when we arrive at the resort , it seem like a pretty nice place but seem to be a little dimmed around the lobby, the check in went o.k, no wellcome cocktail drinks, we proceeded to have our dinner,it was just o.k with less variety than usual. The room we had was near the beach and the main pool, therefore was very convinient for the kids , all of our rooms had crockcroaches and some even had crockcroaches eggs under the pillow cases, we ate at Japanese alacart and the seafood, both time we ordered food , everything ended up to be the same, waste of time, food quality was terrible, evening shows were boring, perhaps inexperience M.C made it even more boring, most of the staffs were nice at the bars and at the restaurants, ground keepers worked tiredlessly to keep the property look pretty nice, we enjoyed the wild lifes, flemingos, peakcocks, fish , birds ects..... the most disappointment aprt of the hold trip was the animacion (enterainment) crews, they don't seem to have much connection with the resort guests but maby think of themselfs as somekind of superstars, not even a genuend friendly Hola, around the pool there were'nt much activity, first five days , we did'nt even hear any local music played, only techno music, it did''nt give the feeling of beeing away, so in summory, the trip was a ripoff, we paid for a 5 star resort but only got maby 3.5 star service. would not recommend to any of our friends and definately not going back to Bavaro Princess resort.

<Content>Lacking Good Service Just got back from Bavaro Princess. I must say the groundsare very beautiful. I really enjoyed the walks through the mangros.The beach is one of the best I have ever seen. Looking from the outside, it is the perfect place to visit. However, a person needs toeat and this is where things change. The food in the buffet area isalways served cold. This fault lies squarely on the head Chef's shoulders. I really think it is a disgrace that a Chef would allow food to be served cold! There are no steamers under the pans.I went to eat when the doors opened every day so I know the food had to have been layed out some time earlier. I was sick from day one. Not sure if it was from the food but just be aware if youwant to dig in. They do have cooks making specialty meals whichare served hot. I would suggest you stick with them. No complaints with them at all. In fact, they served some very goodfood. I did find the diningroom service a little bad. I wouldn't call them lazy but perhaps I would say that they lack a desire to work.Be sure to look at your plate, glass and coffee cups before using them. I found many that were very dirty. In fact, I had a coffee cup that was very dirty and I asked the waiter for a clean one. He tookmy cup and swapped it with a cleaner one on the other table andleft the dirty one for the next customer. When I left, I put that one back on my table so it would be cleaned. Someone had to ensure it would get cleaned! I believe if they can the Chef and putsomeone in there that cares about the job and the health of theirguests, this would be a great place. There simply didn't seem tobe any order at all in the dining room. This is a good resort and can be a great one if they make just a few simple changes. If you have any questions, you can contact me.

<Content>Beautiful place but watch out for the mosquitos!!!! Bavarro Princess Punta CanaBeware of Dengue Fever and Samonella..... When we first arrived it was beautiful and we loved it. Super location and all. We were in the lower number units close to the ocean and pool.. We stayed for two weeks. The grounds are gorgeous and very tropical. That's where I think we ran into some problems. Early morning mosquitoes when we opened our doors to let the warm breeze in. My husband was bitten and upon arrival home became very sick, After numerous trips to the Doctors he was confirmed at having Dengue Fever ....Not a nice thing to come home with. We've been back for 3 weeks now and he is just starting to get better. So beware and keep your doors closed early morning till the sun rises. Apparently o vaccines and no antibiotics,The food looked great all the time but I did question some of the food handling and we both got sick. We thought at first it was just the change of diet but had confirmation here that it was salmonella poisoning. Would I go back? ..Just bad luck...but everything else was great.

<Content>Bavaro Experience We just have returned from Bavaro staying there during the week of December 12-19.What we liked: Grounds - well maintained Beach - is usually clean and well taken care of There are opportunities to take pictures with different animals like iguana, parrots, snake, monkeys (this was especially of interest to small kids).As the platinum guests we did use and liked the services of the Platinum lounge: free internet, nice drinks, relaxed atmosphere, massage, and other conveniences. This was a quite positive aspect of the vacation.To summarize the rest of the impressions:- Restaurants: we didn't like any of the a la carte restaurants at all.The only one I would recommend: El Pescador. The service and food were very good and deserved a tip. The rest of the restaurants surprised me with the lack of basic service or/and not very tasteful food. Even the garment restaurant Liceys - had absolutely No concept of service. The food , when it finally arrived, was salty. We waited for the appetizers for at least 1.5 hours and were getting just smiles instead of food from some of the waiters when they had a minute to spare with us (and the rest of the empty tables in this place).Getting any drinks in the main buffet - was an interesting task. Sometimes it took 3 waiters to understand that we need one sprite drink; sometimes this still was not enough. Even appreciating that this resort doesn't have the automation/technology foundation and eveyrthing is based on simple papers and writing down manual work, it is amazing how one person never knew what other wrote in the same notebook the first person was using.It absolutely felt like left hand doesn't have a clue what the right one does.While booking the restaraunt or having any agreement and discussion with one person, as soon as you would come 10 minutes after to continue the previous discussion - the next in a row would look a the same shared book/notebook and would have No indication at all on the previous discussion.It meant that you would need to start your explanations/orders/reservations from ground zero like you have not done this before.Overall services in the resort I would rate as around 2-3 stars. The room service was always at the time when it was not convenient to us like they were just waiting for this moment. Finally we approached the Platinum lounge and specified the time for the room service. It helped probably just for one time.The shows were low quality with Spanish as the main language, not even a little attempt to have some translation into English.The kids club: no really kids activities, no English, nobody spent quality time with the kids and our kids were not impressed at all.Overall: it is a beautiful resort but I'm quite surprised with the services or lack of services on this property.Would I recommend this resort to anyone else: Nope.The concept of the fundamental services approach, when everything is supposed to be geared towards the client conveniences - is definitely a foreign concept in this resort.Again, if you come not from North America and are comfortable with this style of the services, you should be then fine here. If you do come from places like Canada , US where there are basic rules and standards already established: you may not be a very happy camper here!

<Content>Avoid this Resort at all costs It was the worst vacation ever: all-you can eat closed just as we arrived from the airport; the resort is too large; there is no quality assurance policy: if you complain: no one cares and they will retaliate sneekily: most of the employees all know each other and stick together: i.e. the guy at the check-in desk is the same guy who gives out the towels at the pool and who also dances in the evening show. The pool and beach side music had one CD: Bob Marley: they played it over and over all day long. They offer you a drink from a jug that contains weeds and say it is a shooter: it will give you diarehha for 2 days! There is no disco. The return flight was changed two hours earlier and the hotel staff made no effort to inform us: while we waited for the shuttle: they knew full well it had already came: we had to catch a taxi and then missed the flight and had to pay for a new flight home: the airport did not take credit cards: only cash. The medical doctor seemed to have knowledge of prescription drugs in the room which would suggest someone was going through personal belongings while we were at the beach. Do not leave the resort: it is very dangerous!

<Content>Great Times Honestly I don't know what Dave is talking about. I travelled with 7 friends and we had a great time. The resort is beautiful. The beach is amazing...the sand is soft and there was no seaweed to be found. Whether we were basking in the sun, swimming in the ocean, or enjoying one of our many games of beach volleyball we had a great time. The staff there are incredible and they were always willing to assist you. If your kind and polite...guess what a real shocker...they are kind and polite back to you. The food was great! The buffet offered a great selection....loved the fresh fruit. Breakfast is available from 7 - 10 am...I think the times are fair...come on who really wants to sleep in when the beach is waiting. The swim up bar is great and Reuben was fantastic...no pee pee in the pool! The rooms were nice and big and probably could use a little updating...but honestly how much time do you spend in them anyways. I'm not sure what more I could say other than Bavaro Princess was amazing and thanks to the great friends I travelled with! Good times can't wait to return!

<Content>We really enjoyed ourselves.... We booked our stay via Apple Vacations. We traveled November 9 - November 16. We had an amazing time, however there were times where I was creating a checklist of all the things that had gone wrong. For the most part, a large group of the people that worked at the resort spoke English or made an attempt to speak it. While I found all of the staff to be pleasant and very helpful, there were times when one or two just didn't care and didn't mind showing it. We were there 7 days and I can't say we ever saw our housekeeper (so she didn't get a tip). I did find that the Europeans were not as friendly, some where just plain rude and didn't mind staring - which seemed very strange to me. The food was good, we didn't encounter anything that wasn't great, for the most part the food was fresh all the time in the main buffet and in all of the resturants we dined at. The pools were clean, the trolley ride wasn't that bad for us (we actually stayed in a suite that was within a 2 minute walking distance from the main lobby. We caught the trolley at the main lobby and used it to go back and forth to the beach. The sand was beautiful, but I found that the beach water itself wasn't as clean, it was alot of seaweed, but no one is to blame for that. Overall we had an above average experience and would do it again. Many thanks to our Apple Rep he was GREAT - just like Tony the tiger!! We did 3 excurisons (ATV, Safari Wildlife, and the Glassbottom boat) I would recommend that you do 1/2 day tours - we heard a lot of complaints that the full days were tiring. Make your dinner reservations when you first arrive, all of the pools are shallow, I think the deepest was the 4ft. The animation team was great, they really work hard from day 1 to day 7. I really enjoyed the show at the pool with the fireworks - really pretty. One last thing - while this resort may give the impression that it's an adult only resort, it's not - there were children everywhere....in the pools, at the main buffets, some were running wild and while others were well behaved. Because of this All Inclusive I would do it again!!

<Content>Don't Go Guys,. You Can Do Alot Better. it was just ok.we went with 15 people, were all from toronto.we had all ages ranging from 22 - 50. i think only one of us was satisfied out of this group.the food is just like any other resort, it sucked. no matter where you go i dont think its going to be good anyway. the beach wasnt even that nice, i remeber it being alot nicer when i went to puntacana 5 years ago. the rooms are different, they look good but teh maintenace in them sucks. alot of us had trouble with flooding, and the beds were extremely unconfertable. think the only tyme i slept good was when i popped some gravol or passed out drunk.the scenery is neat, but i didn't pay to go away to a park. i wanted to party like the majoruity of us and it just wasnt happeneing there. the lobby is quiet, at nite it picks up for a bit but barely. the only 24hr bar is in the lobby, and the 24hr snack bar doesnt opne until 12:30 at nite. from 11 p.m or ealier till 12:30 your left with burnt popcorn. i heard breakfast was ok but i never made it to one. they will close the doors on you if you are a minute late and refuse to let you in its crazy.there are 2 pools, one by the lobby one by the beach. the one by the beach is popular and is just ok. the one by the lobby is hardly used and is also just ok. nothing special about it at all ! the swim up bar is nice but you can get that anywhere in dominican so go somewhere else. the beaches are ok, but you can get that anywhere in dominican so go somewhere else.if you want scenerry and like walking thean come here. the lobby is a 10 min train ride from the beach, and even than the train service is crap. its always full, have fun trying to get on.will i be back , no. would i recommend this resort to my firends no. would i recommend dominican hell yea !! its an awesome country to party in just trry a different resort ;) i'll be back to dominican just definately not to the bavaro princess thats all.have fun on your trip !!!! if you chose to go here anyway remember what i said, i painted a picture right here.

<Content>A Very Good Time Vacation dates Nov 9 - 16, 2008 ...We are from Mass.. OK..lets start with it was a vacation with a total of 4 couples 50's and 60's yrs of age....We asked for rooms in the 30 - 35 buildings thanks to TRIP ADVISOR... I got room 323 on 2nd floor..Good view of pool and ocean if you peek thru the trees...RoomsI hate being surprised on vacation and TRIP ADVISOR helps me in that dept...Rooms are huge--step ups and downs from the bed area can be tricky especially after the maid leaves all the lights off--damn scary from the bed to the bathroom--we called that the BAT CAVE cause its a long corridor to the commode and bathtub...YES, the bathroom could have used a lil upgrade-but not that bad,,cmon you spend a few minutes in there.. TV is great only in the front room where there is plenty of seats--from the bed you will get a wrenched neck and you will need glasses from trying to squint--forget watching from the bed unless you bring binoculars...doors and locks worked well... maid was fine...they are tough on extra towels and when we asked for an extra blanket we got more towels--ahh no big deal ... sheets in bed are too short --we had a king size -- again no biggie....a/c worked fine..refrig ok and was stocked--it needed a defrosting...Beach and pool were great...just a short walk... We didnt do much with the organized fun team ....we did watch the Russian guys cheating in volleyball...this guy would not shift when he should have--stayed in frt middle cause he thought he was good - damn I hate cheaters lol...His name was Cheater from the day I saw that !!! .... Ocean can be a lil rough for non swimmers or older people or real young --never leave young kids in the ocean without being right there---no huge swells but a rough chop...no bugs anywhere--day or night...weather was awesome...we walked the beach everyday..gave 'tickets to the ladies who should not be topless lol....if you are looking out at ocean, turn right and walk down beach 10 min and they have a blow up water slide--5 bucks 6 rides etc etc ..was fun and a lot of laughs...FOOD  breakfast buffet was good--cmon now, I know why most people dislike the buffet food--too much and too many choices--sure some of the food/meat is overcooked but you are in a 3rd world country--breakfast like an omelet and toast and juice and potatoes were good and the omelet made in front of you...LUNCH  we always ate at the place near the beach --again was ok --nothing spectacular but adequate--hamburgers were thick but not too juicy ..again ok...damn bees were getting more soda than me from the machine---they have soda machines outside and the bees suck on the sugar--they need those sticky fly catchers hanging down around there..again no biggie....Dinner except for the first night we hit the restaurants....Every place was ok ..gauchos steak place i would get the t bone...chinese/asian place--cashew chicken was very good -- the other shrimp chop suey was nasty and the ribs were too tough ...get the cashew chicken only lol.... japanese was fun ...fish place we got the lobster --ok.... appetizer ask for the lobster meat cocktail without the sauce --add it on the side .. they put too much sauce on the lobster appetizer....italian place was ok -- veggy risoto was very good--dont be afraid to get risoto and another entree .. the salad bar was good too ......GENERAL  the grounds are kept up nice including the beach...the distance from the beach to the main breakfast buffet is a good 10-12 min walk...yes they have trams, but they do get crowded...YES some people try to spread themselves out so you can't sit beside em..just move in and they will move....don't get hung up on the different languages etc...ok I admit it...I said..Boy, wasnt that movie Hunt for Red October great  a few times, just to irk the Russians...remember, they speak english too !! ...Would I go back ?--YES, on one condition, if I was told I would be in the rooms like we got, close to the main pool and ocean - this place is so huge that the rooms near the back are wayyyy too far for me- sure they have a separate pool but I want the beach and the main pool...In my opinion, the platinum spot that I saw where people drank was a joke....NOT near the beach, and surrounded by other buildings where people slept-no view-just my opinion....shows at night  nope, went to bed too early...huge lobby and very clean......Service was ok --sometimes very funny at times...At most dinners I asked for lemon meringue pie...and I got all sorts of things from a lime to glass of water...All in all a great vacation...Remember be open minded and a lil tolerant and SMILE

<Content>Fantastic Holiday--"Best Ever" We have been to Punta Cana/Bavaro for the last 3 years and found this hotel the best so far.Beautiful grounds always being so well tended and wonderful staff in the restaurants (Especially Francia in the Hispaniola and Starlin at the Gaucho lunchtime.Great sized clean pools and beautiful soft white sand with warm inviting sea's (just like the pictures we all dream about visiting)The Teppanyaki was also very enjoyable and worth 1 visit but as the buffet was so good with varied menus and great service we stayed their for the majority of the holiday.The Entertainment is good but very similar to the other Dom Rep hotels we have visited. The live band and singer played well and was worth staying up to hear.I was a bit disappointed with the behaviour of some of the Russian tourists who don't tend to wait their turn for service,they are also up very early claiming beach towel space (the Germans have been pushed into second here).The Americans are friendly tourists who all enjoy the atmosphere but what is going on with those drinks coolers?The first year standard cup sizes were seen, the second year they had doubled in size and this year they seemed to be holding a who can bring in the largest (1500ml capacity) cooler before going above their baggage allowance (they looked a bit silly but totally harmless) Gave us a good laugh anyway!Make sure you haggle with the traders inside and outside the hotel as their prices are inflated often by four times the correct value.Take plenty of single dollars to tip the great staff as they work tirelessly for very little money whilst their families live miles and miles away. (They never stop smiling though).The Casino was ok (would have been better if i hadn't lost)All in all a wonderful holiday and so sad to be home to this grey wet weather (i will never moan about the Dom Rep being too hot again).Forget any negative reviews just go and experience this wonderful complex for yourself.

<Content>A Fantastic holiday We had a fantastic stay and were lucky to be upgraded as originally we were staying at Caribe Club Princess. The place is beautiful and has everything you want and need.We were so glad we ignored the bad reviews on Trip Advisor as if you do not enjoy this holiday then you need your head read. It seems that a minority of our friends over the pond seem to think that every country in the world should have a fake smile, empty pre practised phrases and 1st class silver service - FYI the Dominican Republic is a beautiful yet very poor country, it is a third world country and comparing a resort such as this to a top North American or European resort is pathetic.  Maybe some of our North American friends have not experienced some of Europe that is hundreds of years old as complaining about rust and a bit of paint is absurd. Too many holidaymakers were worried about filling their bubba kegs or being able to fit pizza, waffles, chips/fries, rice, burgers and ice cream all on one plate. We were also mistaken for Europeans or goddamn Europeans on numerous occassions and often heard phrases such as There are too many goddamn Europeans here. I wondered to myself what these peoples' surnames were as i presume the majority of them have grandparents with pesky European surnames. When we commented on the fact that our friends on the continent (Europe) often speak fantastic English some were a bit confused and embarrassed but still resented the fact the resort was being shared - i dont wish to tar every one with the same brush but some people need to get over themselves and enjoy wonderfully friendly staff (English is often their second or third language), superb grounds, beautiful wildlife, an incredible beach, good enough food for the price you pay and great friendly restaurants.The place is beautiful and if you are a pesky european i am sure you will love it but if you are fussy and go on holiday to eat and take photos of bathroom furniture and peeling paint then you are better off not going as you get what you pay for which is exceptionally good value.I honestly think some on this site would label Florence shabby and complain that the pyramids don't have flatscreens embedded in them advertising sausage biscuits.

<Content>Was excellent ignore the fussy remarks and try for yourself. We arrived on the 29th September, we had read various bad reviews prior to going. When we arrived the people were so friendly and helpful in the hotel, the grounds were absolutely immaculate. The locals were gardening every day and the scenery was brilliant. The Entertainment was fantastic, always a great show at the evening and the pool area throughout the day always had various activities for all ages.The food, although it was not the strong point of this hotel, was well varied and has a different theme every night in the buffet area, the tanuki restaurant was an amazing experience too.The hotel was amazing, the beach(wow!) and the bar staff were very friendly. The rooms were a little bit dated, but what do you expect you are not exactly stopping in the worlds richest country. They have air-conditioning and satellite tv, the rest of the time your on the gorgeous beach.The grounds are huge, excellent wildlife, and a nice walk in the afternoon, some reviews complain about the distance walking from the beach to the reception area, but to be honest its a 5 minute walk if the carriages are full from time to time, with 2 or 3 small carriages circulating the grounds constantly to take you to where you desire.To summarise our holiday, it was outstanding, make sure you pay that little extra with the legitimate excursion reps, cheap isn't always cheerful and go to Catalinha island!!!! Amazing day but quite expensive.

<Content>A great vacation spot I travaled to Punta Cana with my husband and my four year old son. We stayed at the Bavaro Princess, from Oct. 14th - Oct.21st.We have traveled to many different place but thiswas our first time in Punta Cana and we enjoyed it.The weather was amazing.The hotel rooms were a little run down. They could use a little fixing up. We had small ants in our room at times. And our air conditioner unit was a little loud.The food was good. There was a great selection. For lunch we always ate at the buffet by the beach. And when traveling with a child it is important to have a geat selection of food.The people working on the resort were very friendly and helpful.The pool also could use and little fix up. There is a pool bar which was very nice. The pool is next to the beach was was great. We had a room very close to the pool, which was an amazing location. The beach was beautiful.Very clean. They did have a kids club but my son wasn't interested. He wanted to spend his time with us in the pool and at the beach.They do have nightly shows at 10:00p.m. We only caught one. (The Lion King).We found the time to be a little late.The resort is large and can be overwhelming at first.But it is a great place and I would recommend it. And we would go back. Keep in mind that 5 star in Punta Cana is not a 5 star in North America. We were aware of this, and we had a great time.

<Content>OK Just returned from a weeks stay. We did alot of reasearch and picked the Bavaro Princess. The buildings are showing their age, repairs and a deep cleaning needs to be done. Things are not done to U.S. standards. The grounds are beautiful and large. You have to do a lot of walking, or wait for a tram that may or may not have room for you. The beach was nice, but may wife and I were talking and thought the beach in Destin Fl. was just as good. The food was filling, we couldn't determine if it was made to European standards or just cooked for the masses, it was ok also. The staff was friendly and even if they didn't talk english they tried to be helpful. There seemed to be a lot of activities to get envolved with or do. The Princess group have employees on their property trying to sell rewards for staying at their resorts, they were pushy and it was annnoying.

<Content>A golden resort that is losing its luster My wife and I just returned from Bavaro Princess for a 1 week holiday with Air Canada Vacations. Our reservation included an VIP Platinum package. This resort was built in 1991 and the golden luster of this hotel is fading way. Guests will see the age of the property in the rooms and common areas but I can imagine it was once the better resorts of it time. Still has the best beach and gardens in Bavaro.Some info about myself, I was trained in resort management and work for a 5 diamond hotel in Vancouver, Canada. I understand the customer and employee perspective of a hotel experience.Overall, my wife and I are satisfied with our stay at Bavaro Princess because of the service we received at the Platinum lounge. The Platinum package was worth it. We had express check-in, access to the internet, premium drinks, VIP reservations at the restaurants, full access to the three other Princess resorts in Punta Cana. All the Platinum suites were no more than 2-5 mins walk to the beach which is a great advantage in a resort of this size. The staff at the Platinum Lounge were friendly, accommodating, and will go out of their way to please the guests. Juan at the Platinum Lounge was AWESOME!!! Unlimited champaign bottles or any other premium bottles were a treat. During our dinner at the Le Petite Fondue in the Punta Cana Princess resort, Juan arrange a private transportation and even waited 30 mins outside the restaurant until we were finished eating. On our last day, we were able to stay in our room until 5pm without a fee. VIP service at it's best !!!The service outside of the platinum area would be above average in DR. Unfortunately, although the staff were friendly and willing to please guests, they had limited service training, language and cultural training, and limited modern hotel tools (upgraded software). These challenges prevented service levels to meet or exceed those in Europe or North America. Appreciate the staff's hard work under there challenging conditions would change your perspective about there committment to service guests. Not all the rooms are equal. We arrived around 9pm and was given a room that was dark and really need a renovation. Next day we called the Platinum lounge and had an option to visit and choose between two other rooms. The quality of the 3 rooms greatly differed. Of course we choose the Oceanview room. Rooms were very, very large with marble and king sized bed. Rooms were so large it felt like a condo. We like our room but if you want Pan Pacific Hotel's 600 thread bed sheets or Westin hotel's pillows and mattresses stay at a 5 plus resort in DR.Restaurants:Main buffet - average in DRChopin - closed for renovation during our staySakura - did not goLicey (fine dinning) - OK service with bad food.Bella Pasta - No goodEl Pascador (seafood) - no goodEl Gaucho (steakhouse) - did not goTanuki - wonderful service and good teppanyaki for an All-Inclusive resortLe Petitie Fondue (Punta Cana Princess) - good service, unique ambiance, ok foodBuffet and beach restaurant (Punta Cana Princess) - much better than Bavaro Princess in food quality and service.Seafood at the restaurants did not seem fresh or most likely way too over-cooked. Drinks were concentrated and coffee was instant Nescafe. I preferred the fresh fruit drinks and dripped coffee during my stay at the Bahia Principe Resorts. Red and white wine were terrible, stick with the cocktails. I liked the fresh waffles for breakfast and crepe for dessert during dinner. I also like Paella. Local drinks: coco loco and mamajuanaThe beach, garden and birds were awesome. Sand on the beach was like powder, water was warm and clean, the gardens were well maintained, wildlife everywhere around this propertyeven swans. Some vendors on the beach selling watersport activities but very considerate when you ask them to leave.Activities on the resort: Beach party on Sunday night was awesome! All ages, all nationalities, just having a wonderful time dancing under the stars. Some shows were funny; especially, Ideal Couple. Spa and gym: Included in our package was a 20 min massage. We also purchased a 50 minute massage the day before our departure. massage rooms were nicely appointed and reasonable good massage. Gym was dusty and had really, really old equipment. I liked the indoor whirlpools in the spa area.Lots of European, Americans, and some Canadians. Don't be surprise to see lots of topless women on the beach. After two days, I was use to it. Not a big deal too me!Overall, my wife and I are satisfied with our stay at Bavaro Princess. It was the most reasonably priced resort in the 4 half to 5 star level in the Bavaro area of Punta Cana for our dates of travel with Air Canada Vacations. When we go back to DR, we will stay at a better 5 star hotel like Paradisus Palma Real or Iberostar Grand to compare. There are several beach areas in Punta Cana region. I heard the water and beach was better in the Bavaro side.

<Content>Average We just got back from Punta Cana and stayed 7 nights 10/12-10/19. We booked a 5 square deal through Apple Vacations. It was not as we expected. Last year for the same amount of money we stayed at a much nicer hotel (RIU). This is not a 5 apple but more of a 3 like its rated on Expedia and Travelocity. We are by no means travel snobs but have stayed in lots of hotels and resorts throughout the US, Caribbean, and Europe and are not picky with food. Here us what our thoughts were in general:Good: -nice grounds and well maintained -huge rooms -spectacular beach that was very clean!! -set-up like a resort not a hotel which is great if you like quiteBad: -poor quality food (geared towards European, all meat was over cooked) -no AC anywhere but the room-huge property had to wait from 鈥渢rams鈥?to take you around-Rooms-old, not updated  -clogged shower drain -have used shampoos and lotions (gross) -no clock, had to call front desk to make dinner resv. On time  -could not see tv from bed  -rock hard bed -main buffet was far away in main lobby  -pool: was large, but should have had some sort of bridge or walk away because you had to keep going all the way around it to get anywhere. Needs major cleaning and painting, cups and cig butts everywhere no one cleaned it until it closed at 6pm! -Bar/Disco- not enough bars, clubs was ok, pretty dingy, the setup of the lobby was not meant for lounging and mingling, it was pretty awkward -Service-Fine, nothing spectacular, not many of the employees spoke any English FYI: lots of topless chicks and dudes in speedos, we did not mind since we are European ourselves but lots of Americans are not used to the type of people here (lots of Russians, French, UK, and Canadians) All in all it was a good time, the grounds were great as well as the beach, but we would never stay at this hotel again, can find much better for the price.

<Content>don't go!!! we were told that this was a five Apple resort and were very dissappointed to find that it was not the case. Rooms need refurbishing badly. Patio furniture is filthy. Tub was in terrible condition. Air conditioning not working as well as mini bar in our first room. Had trouble with lights not working. When I plugged my hair dryer in it fried it. The beach was not kept groomed. Garbage left out in view. Trash containers on beach not emptied regularly. Pool, although pretty to look at, needed work. large areas of pool bottom were chipping. Most of the service was very poor. Were only given 2 towels per day and no washcloths. When I asked for washclothes I was told they did not have any. Although Platinum, guests were given them. If you weren't a Platinum guest, you got poor everything. When we tried to make reservations for restaurants we were told that they were already booked up. That was a lie!!!!! They only opened 1 per night. Although their ad tells you about a number of bars, they weren't all open when we were there. They also were charging for drinks in their disco when their ad says free drinks until 2:30 a.m.

<Content>Bavaro Princess is awesome! I loved the Bavaro Princess.Been to few other places, but nothing comes close to Bavaro.The resort is huge, with mini-zoo , very clean and on good location.It 's not close to town, so if you want peace, this is the great place.Reception employees were friedly and helpful, as well as bartenders and room service.There are 92 houses, each with 8 apartments,so you won't be interrupted by noisy people in the hallway.It means a lot!!There are 7 restaurants, but since the main restaurant Hispanola had huge variety of food, there is not need to go further.Each night different cuisine was presented beside the regular menu.Chefs did a great job on decorations as well.Tables were always prepared, moments after the guests, left, it was ready for other guest.The beach was beautiful, full of white clean sand as well as the swimming area.No sea weeds, rocks, mud.. just white sand.There are few pools.The biggest one is right before the beach, very big, with bar in the water on one side, and on ground at the other end.Wide variety of water sports.Entertainment was great.Even if you don't leave the resort for trips , you'll have plenty to see and do right there in the resort.I just came back from vacation on Jamaica and it cannot compare to Punta Cana in any way.I would recommend this place to everyone.

<Content>Bavaro Princess - Fabulous. This was my first visit and all I can say is fabulous - really exceeded my expectations. We had 36 people in our party who attended my son's wedding - what a stress-free way to have a wedding. Everything was taken care of by the wedding planner, and the private beach party we booked - what a fabulous party and well worth the money we paid! Food was excellent, services were all supplied and the General Manager even paid a visit to make sure everything was ok. I'd like to say a big thank-you especially to her. Already thinking of my next trip there, not even interested in checking out other places. A special mention about the staff - they are fantastic and I hope to meet them again next year.

<Content>Should be named European Princess!!!! Beach was beautiful!! But too many loud, pushy Europeans. Resort was way too large for the number of trams operating and the Europeans pushed their way on even though we had been waiting longer. Food was not good - again geared toward European likes. Stopped going to the evening shows because English wasn't spoken much and we couldn't understand Spanish for most of the show. Usually the entertainment group goes around the resorts we've been to in the past and talked, tried to get the guests involved in games, etc. Not one person approached us or spoke to us. Poorly organized. Although it rained for our first 4 days (which can't be helped), we didn't have an umbrella in our room and asked for 2 days for an umbrella before finally getting one.

<Content>Beautiful Resort and Wonderful Time We just got back from spending a week at the Bavaro Princess and loved every minute of it! (besides the 2 and a half days of rain) I really don't know how anyone could write anything bad about this place!I travelled with 5 other people. All young - between 20 and 25. We all loved it! The resort, grounds and beach were soooo gorgeous! The only thing is, the resort is really big..so for older couples it may be a bit problematic.. But there is a trolly that will drive you and pick you up! The food was sooooo good...there is always something you can find at the buffet that you will love..the ham, turkey, pig roast, the meat was jsut soooo good!! (besides the hamburgers..haha)El Gaucho and Bella Pasta were the best resturants to eat at..el gauco was amazing...best chicken ever..and really good tbone steaks!The rooms were gorgeous..huge and lots of space...the bathroom was a little old and the tub a bit rusty but we dealt with it!!The service was amazing....someone was all over you at every minute!! just an amazing vacation!!!

<Content>Would definately recommend to everyone! Flight: Sunwing: Ontime, rough landing due to rain.My husband and I stayed for 4 days, Tuesday to Saturday. We got a great deal so I decided to upgrade to the Platinum Package. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Its a bit expensive, we paid 200 per person, but when you think about it, its worth it.Check in went smooth, from previous reviews I found you are to tell them as soon as you get off te bus you are platinum. Than the special treatment begins. We were whisked away immediately on our own tram. The lineup at check in was already big and still forming, so we were happy to be leaving the main lobby! They brought our luggage with us as well. Unfortunately it was raining, and rained for the first two days as a system was passing by... But we didnt let that get to us.We arrived at the Platinum Lounge and were immediately offered a cold towel, which was nice to wipe the water off our faces..We were than offered drinks, a nice cold corona!! :)We were than given our 2- 20 minute massage tickets, a box of cigars, 2 tickets for snorkelling, our reservations to licey (get the sirloin with mozarella and tomato sauce) AWESOME!!!!!!!We than went to our room which just happend to be walking distance from the lounge. 798 was our room. It was PERFECT. About a 2 minute walk to the beach, IF THAT. And just right by the lounge which was also perfect! Couldnt have asked for a better location. Arriving to the room, it was freezing!!!!!! So we took care of the air... or so we thought! Our room leaked a bit, in the bathroom.. but we just put towels down and that was fine.There were little tiny bugs. I remember hearing about them. They are almost like 1/2 the size of a regular ant. Not sure where they come from. If you leave an empty drink cup anywhere it will be filled with these bugs in minutes.When the maid came they were always gone. No biggy..We ate at El Gaucho, and Licey. We wanted to go to Bella Pasta but they were booked every night. We met another couple there that had eaten there twice! Very good reviews from that restaraunt. Buffet was good except for breakfast. I HATED breakfast. I never found anything to be good. Any other time was great. So I just usually got a croissant from the platinum lounge.Juan: he is in the platinum lounge. Upon check in he helped us book our restaraunts. We also let him know that this was our first vacation without our daughter since we got married. So he sent a bottle of rum to our room and said we would get fruit basket. No basket, but thats ok!He did however give us false information alot, a BIG draw back. First time was telling us that there was a dinner for honeymooners between 6:30 and 10 in the buffet. I asked if we needed a reservation or a slip or anything and he said no. We arrived at 6:30 and were asked for a slip.. I told her Juan told us we didnt need one. Than she checked and dinner wasnt till 8:30! We were hungry and it was oriental night so we just ate at the buffet... a bit disappointed as we wanted to be a part of the honeymoon dinner.. but oh well.Than, we were told again that check out was to be at the platinum lounge at 7am. He also said he would be there working. NO ONE was there till 7:20 (Our bus left at 7:50) so we wanted to eat.... he arrives on a tram at 7:20, logs onto the computer, turns it around and goes, Systems down, go to the main lobby to check out (I had suggested this so we could eat before we left as it seemed no one was coming to check us out)..... The snorkel trip (free) was pretty good.. we actually enjoyed it more than the one we paid for. We paid 50 per person for the glass bottom boat tour, which you also go snorkelling. They didnt narrate or anything, so when we were looking at a wreck, we didnt know what it was.... until after I saw a sign on the boat and I told everyone to read it so they knew what we had just looked at. Snorkelling wasnt that great either.... didnt see as much as we did on the free snorkel trip!it rained the first two days non stop. But the staff did everything they could to make us all happy. It was nice seeing everyone have fun and laugh. We didnt let it get to us.. we were not at work and that was all that mattered!The resort was also flooded the entire time we were there. So you werent able to walk to the lobby. you HAD to wait for the tram... we walked once in our sandals but walkng by the mangrove there was smelly and the water was gross!! (Thats where it was flooded)... So the tram was ALWAYS busy as you had no choice but to take it.The internet was slow, but usually always free. One computer was down. They have two.. the coffee machine in the platinum lounge is a MUST. Vanilla cappuccino was perfect for our morning coffee... like a Tim Hortons one!! everyone tries real hard to keep you happy. Always a nice Hola.... Another downside is, not much English spoken here. Seems only us and a few others spoke English! Seemed everyone there spoke, German, Spanish, or French. It was nice seeing that the workers spoke ALL of these languages. VERY VERY impressive. But the excursion was spoken in Spanish, luckily there was someone nice enough to translate it into English for us. Take a book, I meant to find one to bring but forgot. Would have come in use. I think if we go back this is a MUST.Ay questions please feel free to ask!

<Content>Better late than never I have tried twice to post this with no luck...here goes again.Short and sweet...travelled with 7 people, aged 15 to 47. Loved everything....the beach in particular is beyond compare!!The food was very good, particularly the made to order sections of the buffet.The homemade donuts in the beach restaurant are a MUST!Ask for upper level room to limit humidity issues and ants. Otherwise just go and enjoy!

<Content>You don't get what you pay for We went to the Bavaro Princess for a summer vacation in July 2008. Honestly, it was the worst vacation we've ever had. We had nothing but problems from the time we arrived, starting with trying to check in. That was a big fiasco. We had upgraded to the Platinum Package before leaving home, but the hotel couldn't find any record of that. We had to pay for it again! If you want anything resembling service, though, you have to get the Platinum Package.The food was terrible. Everything is buffet unless you make reservations at the restaurants, and those are very difficult to make without argument. With the Platinum Package, you get to make reservations at the gourmet restaurant Chopin, but that is almost a joke. For instance, my wife ordered something called Shrimp-Stuffed Portobello Mushroom with Hollandaise Sauce. When it came out, it really looked like canned dog food. There was no portobello (only domestic mushroom pieces), no shrimp (just chicken), and no hollandaise sauce (tomato-based). We tried to complain in English and Spanish (my wife is fluent), but the waiter seemed unable to comprehend either.The rooms look ok at first sight. They are typical Caribbean construction (cement). The A/C didn't work very well, and the bathroom wasn't included in the air-conditioning. We had small black bugs in our bed on two different nights, and we had large geckos running around our room on two other nights.The best part of the stay was the beach. The DR has some nice beaches, and we actually stayed out there more than anywhere else.If you are planning on vacationing in the DR, learn Spanish and stay somewhere else.

<Content>fine, but not great enough to go back My husband and I with some very good friends just returned from punta cana. Though this was our first time in the dominican republic we have stayed quite a few times in Mexico and they do not compare in any way! The hotel was nice, rooms were okay, the grounds beautiful. We seemed to always be told one thing and then it would turn out to be another, we could over look it if it happened once or twice but it happened way too often to be coincidence. The upgrade was sooo not worth the cost. The only extra thing we got was use of an outdoor lounge.. otherwise people who payed less than we did got the exact same privelages! NOT worth the cost to upgrade at all. It was a nice time, beautiful beaches and country but on the whole for the cost we will not return.

<Content>We loved this hotel Forget all the negative reviews you find on this website!! Although not everything at the Bavaro Princess is perfect and 5 stars is a little bit to much for this hotel, you'll gonna have a great time there. It is a very good hotel.I read that people complain about the staff, the rooms and the food, but I think that those people have a bigger problem with themselves than with the Bavaro Princess.My wife, my son of 12 years and I stayed for 3 weeks in the Bavaro Princess in august 2008, so I think we can give a good judgement. Bye the way, we are from Holland.The staffThey are very good, friendly and helpfull. But don't forget to be kind and friendly to them yourself. We have seen quiet a few guests who are not that nice to the staff, so they can't expect a good treatment by them. The staff is allways helpfull with the problems you have, even without tipping.At breakfast the waitresses knew what we would like to drink and it was brought to us without asking very quickly and with a smile.We had lunch every day at the restaurant by the pool. One day all the tables were occupied so we had to wait a little while. A waiter came to me and asked how I was doing. I told him we had to wait for a table and that is was very warm that day. Within 10 seconds and without asking he came back to me with a beer and told me that perhaps I liked one.We like tomato soup and the first lunch there was tomato soup. But that was the only time. So one day I went to chef Jose and asked him whether there could be tomato soup at the buffet one day. He said to me that he would make tomato soup for me the next day. The next day there was no tomato soup in the buffet, so I went to chef Jose again. Yes, he said, I have made tomato soup for you and he went to the kitchen and gave me freshly made delicious tomato soup. I'll make tomato soup for you again the last day you are here, he said, and so he did. How can anybody say that the service in the Bavaro Princess is not good!The girls who clean the rooms and the staff at the reception are also doing a great job. They are very helpfull. For the Dutch guests: Kiara from the reception speaks Dutch. The rest of the reception staff speak sufficient English.The roomsWe booked a junior suite at the main building. The room was huge and 3 persons was no problem at all. No moist, clean and every day hot water. The only problem I had was the airco, because it could not get the temperature below 23-24 C (73-75 F). That is not good enough for me. The technician could not fix it. So halfway our holiday we changed to a bungalow (room 305, bungalow 30). We had to pay $ 300. That room was next to the pool, perfect. The room was even bigger. And the airco was perfect. There was plenty of beer, cola (diet) and sprite in the fridge every day.In 3 weeks we saw 3 cockroaches. For a hotel in the tropics that is very good.Some people complain about mosquitos. Yes, there are mosquitos, but not that many and you can't blaim the hotel for them. You can do something about the mosquitos. You can loosen the bulbs outside the door of your room so the lights go out and the mosquitos will go somewhere else. Don't leave your door open when the lights are on in the room. Or ask the girl who cleans the room (or dial 3000) for a spray (can) against mosquitos and spray your room when you go to dinner. That helped us and none of us was biten by mosquitos in 3 weeks.Bungalows 19, 20, 21 and 22 are near the water installation which is noisy and smells. Bungalows 23, 24, 46, 47, 48, 54 and 65 are near the mangrove that is in the middle of the resort and there is a bad smell too (as a mangrove should). Bungalows 1, 4, 5, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 are next to the pool.Food and drinksThe food is excellent. We never stayed in a hotel with such a great buffet (and we stayed in hotels with 4 or 5 stars all over the world many times). What a choice, what a quality. We ate several times there but mostly we had dinner at the a la carte restaurants. The food there was very good. Our favorites were El Gaucho (great Argentinian steak!) and Bella Pasta. Tanuki (Japanese) is also very good. The food in Sakura (Chinese) is good but wasn't our taste. We didn't try the seafood restaurant. You have to make a reservation for the a la carte restaurants every day by mr Freddy who sits outside the Hispaniola restaurant from 08.00 till 11.00. The breakfast buffet is huge and with a great variety. People who complain about the food at the Bavaro Princess should be ashamed! (Yes, it is not MacDonalds)Pool, beach, premisesThe pool is huge and nice. In the high season you have to get up early to get a palappa. The same goes for the beach. You can swim to the pool bar for all kind of drinks. I read that there would be not enough alcohol in the cocktails. Don't worry, they put a lot of alcohol in them and they taste great.We think that the temperature of the water in the pool is too high.The beach is awesome. When you walk to the left for 15 minutes there are souvenir shops on the beach. Don't make a deal with Pedro on the beach for parasailing or other activities, he is a real scam.The premises are very big. A walk from the main building to the beach takes 12-15 minutes. It is a beautiful walk, because the garden is very beautiful and well kept. There are pelicans, peacocks, ducks and other birds. You can also take the little train. There are 3 of them so you don't have to wait very long. In 3 weeks 4 or 5 times the train was full, so we had to wait for the next one.Animation teamThey do a great job and work many hours every day. They are very friendly and try to please you as much as they can.Every evening there is a show in the main building. The shows are entertaining but are not that professional. 4 Years ago we stayed at the Grand Paradise in Punta Cana and the shows there were amazing. The shows in the Bavaro Princess can't measure with them.Cesar is the star of the animation team. He is great.

<Content>Beautiful resort, so-so customer service... My fiance and I recently returned from a 6-day stay at this resort. It is as beautiful as any picture can show, and so big! There was plenty to do on the resort, from swimming in the luke-warm ocean or huge pool (with a swim-up bar--a favorite), to dining at the buffet or restaurants (recommend the Japanese food--excellent sushi), or walking through the Mangrove trails to see exotic flora and fauna. There is a slight foulness to the air as you walk through the rainforest areas. The stagnant water and rotting plants will do that. It's not unbearable. There are lots of birds and fish all around the resort (even in the lobby) and make for great pictures. I recommend having a travel agent you can meet with for excursions. Our guide was helpful with his recommendations, (and warnings--i.e. don't buy any timeshare from beach vendors, etc.). We went snorkeling one day, which was totally worth it. Buy a waterproof camera--the pictures are great! It was very hot, but our room was cool (for the most part--they were actually having some issues with the AC system). Just a warning for families with young children--the TV stations are not censored (language) and neither is the beach! There are plenty of topless women and speedo-clad men...beware.You do not need to speak Spanish at this resort, but it helps. At times we Americans felt a bit uncomfortable (unwelcome?) around particular staff. The one real complaint that we had about the resort was the lack of respect and courtesy we received from the customer service desk, in regards to Freddy. He did not seem to like my fiance the moment he spoke to him in English. He was very short with him and was not very nice when we tried to book some reservations to the restaurants (which we HAD to do through him). When we tried getting help from someone else, Freddy even gave us a reservation to a restaurant that, we later learned, was closed for the night. That was very disappointing. Try to avoid dealing with Freddy if at all possible.Overall, it was a very nice trip. The room was spacious, the view was amazing, and the food was really good. My fiance and I decided that though it was worth it in the end, we will probably go somewhere else next time.

<Content>Ok, but wouldn't go back. My family and I (a party of 9) stayed at Bavaro from Aug. 10-13. Our vacation in D.R. was until the 17th; however we ended up transfering to another resort. Bavaro was ok. It happened to be that week they were sold out. It seemed over crowded. I felt like I was in Disney World because of how many people. The rooms were clean and very spacious, I have no complaints. The food was exceptional, I didn't expect anything less. However, dinners were hectic. Buffet dinning room always felt over crowded. We had to wait for plates a few times and it was hectic getting a waiter to serve you drinks. The lines for the food stands were also long. The only place with AC in the whole resort was the room. The trolly's to get from your room to the main dinning hall or main plaza were also hectic. At night, for the most part, we had to wait at least 15 minutes for one. Most drove by full and we had to wait for the next one. The main pool with the swim up bar wasn't too clean. Guests would leave their empty cups around the pool and I never saw staff cleaning the area until closing. And again the pools seemed crowded to me. The beach was beautiful, no complaints. By the 3rd night we asked to transfer to another resort, that compared to Bavaro was amazing. Much less crowded, new (just opened in January) and over all exceptional. Bavaro is beautiful due to it's landscaping, parrots, flamingos, birds, flowers etc... and the old Dominican country feel that it takes pride in. But if you're looking to feel relaxed, not to hustle and to be close to everything with just a short walk from your room; I don't suggest Bavaro. As hot as the weather is in D.R. you would think that an A.C. dinning room would be a must in such a large resort, but it's not. Oh, and one more thing, the theatre where you except to enjoy a nice show. You don't. It's located in the main plaza, no A.C. and it's open so while some are trying to enjoy the show, others are at the bar, and others walking to or from the buffet. In other words you barely get to enjoy the show. One more thing, if you have pre-teems or kids around the age of 8-11; it's not a very kid friendly resort. To sum it up, we were not going to leave our kids in what the called their Kids Club, a small fenced in area on the beach where the kids could play ping pong or basketball. And any kind of entertainment or night life (other then the casino which is outside the resort) shut down by 11pm. But if you decided to go, enjoy. But for the same amount of money you can stay at a few other locations.

<Content>We had a great time on our honeymoon!!!!! We went for our honeymoon it was GREAT. The property was beautiful. The property was large but they have transportation service that ran around the clock. Our room was right on the beach how great was that!!. The people were SOOO nice and not because it was their job. We done extra excursions they were wonderful swimming with sharks, outback safari. we had a wonderful time. We booked through apple vacations the rep was at the airport when we arrived and at the hotel. How great was that!!! The hotel was beautiful, the food was great. This vacation was perfect and did not break our pockets. They were doing a lot of construction in the area and we cannot wait to go back so see what need things they will have. Hotel did not have a lot of shopping choices and not to eager to go out into the town. Casino was small....GO STAY HERE YOU WILL NOT REGRET

<Content>Much preferred Caribe We have gone to Punta Cana for 10 days each summer for 5 years. It is an escape for us near the end of the summer (mid to late August each year). We have stayed at 5 different resorts since each time is new and exciting. We knew eventually we would find one that we would not move on from or that we would say, we really preferred the others. We finally found that last one. We will be going back to any of the other four after this. Princess's own property just down beach from Bavaro called Caribe was excellent but Bavaro disaapointed us. The main problem was that the place did not seem especially interested in the fact that we were there. At other places upon arrival, they sat us down in comfortable seats. brought us cool washclothes and drinks and brought us our room keys. Here they said, There's the check in line. We stood in line for our keys and found the people ourselves to take our luggage to the room. At other places, whenever you saw an employee from the head honcho to the groundskeepers and maids, everyone had a smile and Hola! Here even the Anamacion staff walked right by with a blank look unless they were on duty. The maids were the only ones who were consistently friendly. One night we had no hot water for showers but they wouldn't even get us another room to shower in so we could get to dinner. It was truly unbelievable--I finally gave up and took a cold shower. The maintenance worked hard and got it fixed by 10:15. We were with Apple Vacations but our rep had gone home already by the time we realized it would be a bigger problem than we thought. I hope they will downgrade them from 5 star since we had better experiences at 4 star places. Apple, by the way, is excellent and efficient and makes life easier most times! Having said all that, the food was fine. The buffet was worse than others but restaurants were better in general. We especially enjoyed the Italian (2 different excellent fish dishes)and the Japanese was excellent and fun. We did not like the fish restaurant that was included though. Sunscape which was 5 star had MUCH better food. The beach was excellent (although they're slow to clean up the garbage--it's not at all excessive though). It's at a southern tip so it gets sun about half an hour longer than Caribe and it's a very deep beach--plenty of room for chairs near the water or under palm umbrellas--it didn't feel crowded. Rooms were fine (first time I have gone home without damp clothing from the air due to the set up of the rooms). They are set up nicely (except at night when you have two steps to the bathroom) with plenty of space, coffee maker, refrig, couch, and table with chairs. On the day of Tropical Storm Fay, it was nice to have the extra space of a suite to walk around in. We finally put bathing suits on and walked around in the rain and wind and had a grand time!Bottom line for us is that as long as we have sunshine and a beautiful beach with adequate food, we're fine so we had a wonderful vacation regardless and will definitely return to Punta Cana.

<Content>Fabulous Vacation My wife and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from May 17-21. I read many reviews and comments on the forums and was expecting average. What we experienced was exceptional. The staff was fabulous. Always smiling and willing to help in any way. The bartenders were extremely fun and engaging (Thanks Braulio and Reuben!) The poolside animation team was fun and energetic. The facilities were very well maintained. Our room was three buildings off the beach and pool area. The room was a bit dated but we only used it to sleep and freshen up a bit. The food was good. Not great, but I wasn't expecting fine dining. We went to the steakhouse one night and were very pleased with the quality and service. The beach was nothing less than amazing. We always found chairs to relax in for our daily afternoon catnap. Never a problem with lack of beach chairs. We will be back!

<Content>Large rooms, Beautiful property, clean  Large apartment style rooms, cleaned everyday. Packed beach, always found a chair, always got a clean towel.Food was good, the best of the food was the soups! Trolley take you around the resort so you don't have to walk but don't rely on them after 1am or if you are taking an excursion bus from the lobby before 7am. We stayed near the beach and it is a half hour walk to the front lobby where are bus was waiting to take us to La Romana and on to Isla Saona. We did the Dune Buggy trip and that was great but if you do this wear clothing you do not care about as the mud stains! Bring plastic bags for your camera and money etc. We went to a club just down from the resort (west) and that was fun but there are prostitutes for hire everywhere, offering men in the club. The Casino and disco at The Bavaro was near empty, the Disco had nobody in it. We booked last minute from Vancouver (YVR) and paid I think around $1350+taxes. This was the same we paid to go to the Riu in Cancun the previous July and even though the flight was longer to Punta Cana I will come back over Cancun/Playa Del Carmen/Mayan any day.

<Content>IF YOU'RE A NON-SMOKER- STAY AWAY FROM HIS ONE!! Just returned from a one-week stay at the Bavaro Princess and was very, very disappointed. The resort bills itself as 5-star facility but barely makes 2 - and I give those 2 stars for the lush tropical landscaping. This is a resort for smokers and/or people who have never been to a real 5-star resort (or a 4-star or 3-star for that matter), and/or people with super-low expectations about their accomodations, food, and service.Let me begin with what was good about the hotel: 1) Lush tropical landscaping that is very well maintained. Wehn you go to a Caribbean resort, this is what you want the grounds to look like. If whoever does their landscaping and maintains their vast grounds ran the resort, it might be worth coming back to.2) Beautiful beach.3) Large rooms.4) Nice, large, comfortable casino on the property which was empty on each of our two visits. I would recommend a visit to the casino if only to take an air break as it seemed to be the only place in the entire resort with truly cold A/C. A veteran of the BP told us the reason the casino was so empty is because the slots don't pay and he felt even the games were rigged. He pointed out that there is little oversight of casinos in the Dominican Republic and certainly not the sort of regulation applied to casinos in the US. I don't know about all that as we are not big gamblers. We enjoyed our two hours of cool air at the casino.5) Friendly staff: most of the staff we dealt with were very friendly and helpful.Why I would never go back to the Bavaro Princess:1) If you're a non-smoker, as I am, keep away from this place. Smoking is not only permitted everywhere, it seems to almost be encouraged. People smoke in the main dining room, in the restaurants, at the pool, IN the pool, at the beach, IN the water at the beach, on the trams, in the theater, and in their rooms. There are NO non-smoking rooms or public areas at this resort so a non-smoker is subjected to the disgusting stink of cigarettes virtually everywhere. Smokers think nothing of flicking their cigatettes anywhere they wish including on walkways, at the beach, in the pool area and from moving trams. Rooms are sectioned four to a building (two up and two down) and seem to share the air conditioning. If you have a neighbor who smokes, the stink will be in your room as well. There is NO escaping cigartette smoke here.2) I don't expect a whole heck of a lot when I go to a resort but I DO expect air conditioning that works (especially in a place where the temperture was routinely in the 80s-90s fahrenheit and the humidity was high to match). The A/C in the rooms was marginal at best. There is no such thing as 'cold' air - the best you can hope for is 'cooler than outside.' The main dining room, which is where you will do most of your eating, is an enormous building open at the sides with NO air conditioning. Meals were sweat-fests. A handful of restaurants on the property did have A/C but there, too, it was only enough to be better than outside. If cold A/C is something you need to have a comfortable stay in a hot tropical locale, this is not the place for you.3) When I travel, I also expect a comfortable place to sleep. Again, the rooms are large, but the lack of cold A/C and beds that were like sleeping on ironing boards made our stay very uncomfortable. Choice of beds is what they refer to as a twin (smaller than what a twin would be in the US) or a king (more like a small US queen-size). My 6'1 frame didn't do well on the 3x6 'twin' that was basically the size of an army cot but not nearly as comfortable.4) This resort is Spanish-owned. Do not expect US-type service nor employees who speak fluent English. I speak Spanish so it wasn't much of a problem for me, but I heard a number of American guests complain that they had problems being understood especially when it came to problems with their rooms or service. The clientelle when we were there was largely Spanish, Argentinian, Dominican, and Russian with Americans probably 5th in number followed by some German and French. 5) Blankets provided were threadbare in spots and most of the towels we received during our stay were worn and frayed at the edges and should have been retired long ago. There's no excuse for worn-out blankets and towels.6) When we arrived (late- at about 10PM) at our room, there was a slow leak in the line that runs from the wall into the toilet, spreading a line of water across the slick bathroom floor. After almost breaking my neck slipping on the water, I called Guest Services. The person who answered said that they were alone and that they wouldn't be able to send a service person out until the next day. The following day it took 3 calls over a four-hour period to get someone out to fix the leak. The remote control for the TV didn't work and a check revealed there were no batteries in it; once turned on, the panel controls on the TV didn't work and we couldn't turn the TV off. We had to yank the plug to get it off and getting batteries for the remote AND a tech to repair (or replace) the TV took the same 3 phone calls and 2 days. When we returned to our room later that evening (after a day at the beach and before dinner) we found a half-drunk bottle of coke on a counter and one of the bottles of water in the fridge had been opened, partially drunk, and put back. Not exactly a 5-star hotel.7) There are hokey shows in the theater each evening. If you are expecting Las Vegas-style entertainment (or even cruise-ship quality entertainment), this is not for you. The theater is in the same building as the main dining room. It also lacks A/C and was a smoke-filled, sweat box. 8) Trams are necessary for all but the most hearty to navigate the resort. Our room was at the far end, away from the beach. Trams supposedly run 24 hours a day. We found it nearly impossible to get a tram at the peak dinner hours and wound up walking to the dining room each evening. Again, bear in mind that people think nothing of smoking on these often-crowded trams (and not a day went by that we didn't see someone flicking their lit cigarette into the bushes from a moving tram).9) There are two nice-sized pools on the property. The main pool is close to the beach. Plenty of chairs and free pool towels are provided. The main pool has a bar located inisde it that you can swim up to and order free beverages. Resort newbies seem to really like this feature. The water temperture when we were there made the pool feel like a hot bath, which people seemed to enjoy (I preferred the ocean). What's bad about the pool: there are no restrictions on children being in the pool. We saw people with infants in pampers and were close-by at least one incident where a baby actually defacated into the pool. As noted above, people smoke IN the pool, putting their cigarettes out wherever it is most convenient for them anywhere nearby. With its super warm temperature, many children and infants and many inconsiderate smokers, I found the pool unsanitary and not a place I would want to hang out and certainly not a place for kids to spend the day unless they've had all their shots.10) And speaking of kids- A note to Americans thinking of bringing their children here: As this resort caters largely to Europeans and South Americans, a number of women were topless on the beach. This seemed to be a big plus for the many 20-somethings vacationing from the USA but seemed to come as a surprise to Americans there with their kids who found themselves doing some explaining they might not have expected. 10) Food was a major disappointment. Most of your eating will be done in the large main dining room. It is buffet-style and, as previously noted, it is a sweaty free-for-all. While the buffet offered a wide selection of food, varied by theme each night, the food was mediocre at best. The 'hot' food was not placed on burners or under heat lamps and was cold for all but the first to get at it. The cold food was not placed on ice or in refrigerated units so it was luke-warm by the time anyone who came later on in the meal got to it. Two of the restaurants we ate at did a good job with their meals: One was the Japanese restaurant where guests sit Benihana-style around a common table with the chef cooking in the center. The chef was entertaining and the food was good. The Argentinian restaurant El Gaucho did poorly on service but a good job with our Argentinian steaks. El Gaucho is not air coniditioned. For some bizarre reason, men are required to wear long pants to the restaurants which would be fine if they had adequate A/C. El Gaucho had none and the rest had only 'cool' air at best. Women can come dressed as they wish, and many did. So you men sweating in long pants sitting across from women in shorts. Go figure. 11) Mangrove and zoo: The resort had, to its credit, preserved a natural mangrove area that is accessible by a short walking trail. It is a nice touch and is great for the kids who get to see turtles and fish from the trail. Unfortunately the resort feels it necessary to keep a small 'zoo' along the trail with a handful of cages housing birds and one for iguanas. The enclosure for the vulture was way too small and none of the cages had clean water for the animals when we passed through - yes - we looked. There is no security and while we were walking through some [-------] and his rotten kids were throwing bread AT the caged vulture which was obviously distressed by the harrassment. The large iguana enlcosure had no foliage, shade or clean water when we passed by. Cruelty to animals is very unappealing to most Americans. The resort should do away with the zoo and just have the natural mangrove trail. It is pretty enough without mistreating any birds or other animals. Conclusion: Nice tropical setting, beautiful landscaping; nice beach; big rooms; mostly nice, friendly staff. Bad A/C, bad beds, unsanitary pool, smokers and smoking everywhere, poor food. As I said in the beginning: This is a resort for smokers and/or people who have never been to a real 5-star resort (or a 4-star or 3-star for that matter), and/or people with super-low expectations about their accomodations, food, and service. If I were 20 years old and had never been anywhere else, I probably would have loved this place.

<Content>Exceeded my expectations! I stayed at the Bavaro Princess with 3 other friends from July 26 to August 2nd, 2008.Firstly, it totally exceeded my expectations. After reading many reviews I was expecting something very mediocre, but instead got an amazing vacation!!!There may be a few down sides such as, not being walking distance to the beach, but there is a trolly every few minutes to take you there (or pay to upgrade), limited number of staff who can understand and speak english fluently, but service is still amazing, and most of all there was a transportation strike the day I left which left me in the airport for 8 hours. But all that aside it was absolutely beautiful! They offered a wide range of food varieties. The seafood and steak a la cartes are so worth it. The beach is just as beautiful as the pictures. And the nightlife is definitely worth checking out, if thats your thing. Overall I would go back in a heartbeat! Just make sure to pack that SPF.*cheers*

<Content>AMERICANS DO NOT GO!!!!! We Stayed at the resort from July 31 to August 7. We will never return back. We are open minded people and Don't complain about a lot of things, We have traveled to Punta Cana, Mexico and Jamaica. We realize that we aren't in the states. The resort was too large ,and we had our two kids. The trams were always full and the RUDE people from the other countries would jump in front of you. No matter where we have traveled we have always had great service. We were always figyhting to get help. The others that spoke Spanish were helped right away and got better service. We had little bugs in our room. They were like ants, I think they came off the fresh flowers they leave in your room. That did not bother us. BUT THE ROACHES DID. They were in the bathroom and they were little ones. So I called and they sprayed our room. The next day we had roaches in our bedroom that were at least 1-2 inches long. I wanted to go home. The night before we left I found 2 in our suitcases. I have never had this experience anywhere we have traveled. Our suitcases never came in our house and I washed everything. KEEP THEM CLOSED. We had a sewage smell coming from our bathroom. The room had a broken towel rack and some mildew, but that didn't bother us. We never had towels, we had to call every night at 6: 00 to get some. The wet bar sink lifted up, and had no water connected to it. I poured some water in it to empty a bottle out and it went on the floor. The drain wasn't even connected. I felt like a total outsider there. We not treated like the others. The beach and the grounds were awesome. They were always working. Although there is a sewer plant that the tram passes and it almost made me get sick when we passed it. I was very glad to get home. After 2 days there I was counting the days to go home. That has never happened. The food is nothing to brag about. My kids survived on pasta noodles and rice. I had salad most of the time and nachos. Overall, do not book. I tought it would be ok because I saw the mixed reviews. It was a good deal, but never again. This is not a 5 star resort.

<Content>Hit and Miss - This hotel was advertised as a 5 star resort and was the best value for the perceived benefit before we went. The resort is an older one with only some of the units being kept up to a higher star rating. Some of the people we stayed with got excellent rooms only after complaining where as most were designed well and I am sure were great 10 years ago but haven't been kept up to a high level. In addition if you have concerns about black mold or know about the health risks of it - don't read any further and pick another resort. The people there are very friendly in general and always will say Ola to you when you pass by with a big smile - and I mean always which makes you wonder what happens if the don't? (not to be too cynical). But when it comes to gettinng service you will quickly find out who has their act together and who to avoid because service levels vary by person there. The one group which always impressed me was Guest Services who always had their act together. The food is average resort food. I can't believe some of the reviews I have read on here saying it was the best food people ever tasted. Its resort food - we even had lobster which tasted like resort food.The beach ? Thats why people come here. Its world class. Long and deep sand with beautiful warm water.As for night activities there is the daily night shows which suprised me as being actually very good. But if you want any nightlife outside of the it is extremely lacking as the resort nightclub is horrible and the other recomended nightclubs nearby are average or dangerous at best. In all this is an average resort. If you get a great deal on it - I would take it only if you go for all the uprages in which case it can pass for a 4-star. But if you are looking for anything except free booze and a nice beach then look somewhere else.

<Content>Loved It ! This is my second time in Bavaro Princess (was there a couple of years ago) and I had a FABULOUS time there once again. Stayed there on my own July 26-Aug 2nd and here are my comments. This is a very TROPICAL place to stay which is a biggie for me. I had a look at the Riu resort when I was there and it is ENORMOUS  VERY ORNATE. so if that is your thing then check it out but as I said when I am in the Dominican I want to feel like I am staying in a tropical place. not Versailles.Here is my breakdown and please Email me if you have any questions.BEACH - clean.. warm... beautiful.. !!! the jewelery vendors from a couple of years ago are no longer cruising the beach at all.EXCURSIONS - I am big on excursions and there are alot to do.  HORSEBACK RIDING along the ocean was the best I have ever done. please watch your cameras as two people unfortunately lost theirs along the beach somewhere. you have a choice of 1 or 2hrs. I did the two hours adn regardless of which you go for the entire ride is along the ocean right by the water. please remember to tip. PARASAILING - LOVED IT big time.. ! again please always tip. SAONA ISLAND - I know alot of Trip Advisor ppl love this place but I thought it was only all right. nothing great. CATALINA ISLAND - now THIS place I loved much better than Saona. email me and I'll tell you why.VENDORS - located across the street in a shoppoing mall and along the street too. they are desperate for your business. never ever ever pay what they are asking for. I understand they have a living to make and I want to help them out but chargin me $85 for a bracelet when they will take $30 for is is a big difference for me.CASINO - I am not a casino person so sorry cannot help you hereSTAFF - VERY friendly and helpful. if you see someone doing maintenanceon the grounds aske them to cut down a coconut for you which they are happy to do. they will slice it open for you and you can drink straight from the eversofresh coconut. please tip the guy of course for obliging you as everybody there on the island needs whatever you can give.ROOMS - beautiful, clean, never any bugs, hot  cold water always at my disposal. the clean up person forgot to give me full towel set so I called front desk and I had it there when I got back to my room after dinner.RESTAURANTS - Make your dinner reservations when you get there ASAP. do not leave it too long as not every restaurant is open every night and they do fill up so book early ! the staff are all very kind to you but the food really does need to be improved. El Pescador was the worst and Il Gaucho was the best. the Angus sirloin steak came exactly as I ahd ordered it rare-medium rare. the lobster appetizer was superb and the pumpkin cream soup was the best I have ever had as it was made with lobster medallions and parmesean cheese. Mmmm good ! the hotel buffet is always deliscious and the variety is there every night. no complaints there at all.DRINKS - I am not much of a drinker but watch out for ANY CREAM drink, like pina coladas or banana juice.. as they are all laxitives in hiding. a secret for this to avoid is to eat plenty of fresh papaya and you will be saved for the natural recouse after you get home trust me.. !Email me with any questions you may have ~

<Content>Great resort! Terrible food!! The Bavaro Princess was a great place to stay. I recommend upgrading to the Platinum package, it's worth the extra bonuses. The staff was excellent. Margarita and Ana in the Platinum Lounge were wonderful! The resort grounds were beautiful and well taken care of. Our room was very nice and the maid service was very good. The beach was always clean and beautiful! The food, however, was TERRIBLE! In the 7 days I was there, I lost 9 lbs. Don't waste your money going to Licey, it was the worst food I've ever eaten and the other restaurants aren't much better. The buffet was awful most nights. The Mexican buffet night was ok. If you like to eat, I would not stay here. By the second night I was so sick I could barely leave the room. Great resort, terrible food!

<Content>Wonderful vacation I stayed at this resort from July 15, 2008 through July 22, 2008. I had an amazing time at the resort. I would not visit if you are not an open-minded person. Punta Cana is a vacation spot mostly visited by Eurpoeans and Spanish people. English is not spoken vary often, but you can get by. Everyone was very friendly, and the beach was one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. It was very hot, but there was a pleasant breeze, so you could easily stay on the beach all day. The rooms were nice, I had no major problems with bugs. One afternoon, I left my wet beach cover-up on the terrace in a ball, when I opened it up, a cockroach did fall out. But that was not in my room, and my own fault for not airing my clothes out properly. The Japenese steakhouse was great, all the other restaurants were so-so. Don't expect gourmet food. But then again, I went on vacation for the beach, drinks and just to relax. I had stomach problems the first day, but that is not uncommon - traveler's diaherra happens anywhere you go. Its the combination of food, sun, drinking. basically you are changing up your every day routine and your body has to adjust. Dont blame the resort! The grounds are spectacular, they do a very nice job of keeping everything clean. I honestly dont know what people could complain about. Relax and have a good time, you are not in the States anymore. Dont expect the Ritz, this is a 3rd world country!I did the monster truck safari which I highly recommend. You see common DR houses, and really get to see true Dominicans. Life in the DR is not like it is in the resort.Even though the staff doesn not speak much English, they do their best. Remember you are a visitor in a Spanish speaking country, try learning some Spanish before you go!! Also the nightly shows and music were entertaing - not the best, but I was open-minded and enjoyed the effort the staff put into entertaining their guests.

<Content>Great Vacation At Bavaro Princess My husband and I were in Punta Cana at the Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort from July 11-18, 2008. It was our first time in Punta Cana. It was very hot. The Bavaro Princess is huge and very, very nice. We upgraded to the Platinum Package which was well worth it. As soon as we arrived, we were taken to the Platinum Lounge to check in and had a room in minutes and we arrived before check-in time. The Platinum Lounge had coffee, juice, pastries, soda, beer, etc. there anytime from 7 am to 11 pm, use of the internet, DVDs to watch, etc. We were in Room 782, first floor, which was steps away from the Platinum Lounge, very close to the beach and one of the pools. We rode the tram every day to the buffet or restaurants and usually got a seat on the first try. The beach was beautiful and very clean. I would have liked the water better if there were no waves like in Nassau. My husband got up and went to the beach every morning about 7:00 to put our towels on chairs otherwise you wouldn't get a spot under a palm hut. All of the workers, maids, bartenders, waiters, waitresses were very friendly. Some spoke English, but more didn't, but you find a way to communicate. We booked through Apple Vacations and there were 3 Apple reps. on duty and they were great.We walked both ways on the beach and found vendors selling all sorts of souvenirs you can bargain for. They started out high, but you could get them down considerably - at least 50% sometimes more. It was a very long walk each way, stop and take a dip. Also, directly across the street from the Resort are shops for souvenirs where you can bargain.We walked or rode the tram most nights to the Tower Casino at the beginning of the property. It's a small casino, but nice. We went to several of the shows which started at 10:00 p.m. Some were ok, some not so good.We ate breakfast every morning in the main buffet which was very good and lunch either there or at El Gaucho on the beach. We also had dinner at the main buffet, El Gaucho (changes to a steak house at night (stay away from the Argentinan steak), Pescador and Licey. Licey came with the Platinum Package and that was our favorite. Pescador was the seafood and that was very good, too. Men have to wear long pants and collared shirts and you need reservations at all of the restaurants except the buffet. Some of the food in the other restaurants was ok and some not so good. The hamburgers at the beach grill didn't taste so great -- we were told they were goat. Several people had some stomach problems, but we were ok. We ate and drank in moderation.My husband enjoyed the topless beach, but after a day or two you got use to it. On Tuesday night Apple had a dinner for everyone that booked through them. That was nice, but could have been better if there were things to do other than eat.Didn't have any trouble with mosquitoes like some people have reported, but we did have a bug in our room one night that I was not happy to see.We went on the Outback Safari Excursion - Alex and Leo were out guide and driver and really enjoyed that. The last hour or so they take you to a private beach for boogie boarding and it was positively beautiful. We also took the Cigar Factory/Museum tour and we could have skipped that one. You can buy cigars on the Outbark Safari tour much cheaper. All in all, we were happy with the Bavaro Princess and really enjoyed ourselves. It was a great vacation. I'm not sure why some people give the Bavro Princess such a bad review. I guess you just can't please some people. We met some great people while we were there from other states.I'd be happy to answer any questions.

<Content>Friendliest Vacation Spot!!! We just returned from a four day stay at the Bavarro Princess. I can honestly say my only regret was that we didn't have longer. The staff was the friendliest staff at any hotel we have ever stayed at anywhere. They worked hard to make you feel like your were in paradise.Many have complained about the food. Overall the food is pretty good. Its not outstanding, but better than any cruise I have been on or any other resort.The grounds are beautiful and the rooms are nice. Very comfortbable with good AC.I strongly suggest that those going to the Bavarro Princess upgrade to the Platinum Package. We got a snorkeling package, two 20 minute masages, quicker check-in, a room closer to the beach, and several other goodies.I highly recommend this resort!

<Content>Went for a family wedding and much-needed vacay I just returned from a week's stay at the Bavaro Princess for a family wedding and this was my first all-inclusive experience. As a newbie, I was impressed with a lot of things about the resort.RoomsThe suites are definitely spacious for two people and I was glad to receive the lock and key for the in-suite safe at check-in. You also receive a towel card to use daily so don't bother packing a bulky beach towel. Because of the humidity, there is admittedly a damp, musty smell to the rooms and at times the ventilation seemed to have crossed suites as I could smell traces of smoke and cologne from another room (?!) Tip: Try to avoid the complex 20 set of suites as they're the closest to the sewage treatment station and don't really have much of a view.Staff Due to the late arrival flight the staff intuitively ushered us into the main dining hall (Restaurant Hispaniola) to ensure we got to eat something before it closed at 10pm rather than spend time checking in first. The staff are friendly and while they may not know English that well, they work long and hard and do their best to serve you. In the sweltering heat and humidty you have to give them credit for doing their jobs in long sleeved pants and shirts. Tip: Bring along a Spanish phrasebook. I brought my big Spanish For Dummies book and it made for a great beach read and immersion experience!Resort The grounds are extensive enough that a hop-on, hop-off golf cart tram is in service all day to drive you around the suites, the beach, restaurants and the main lobby complex. During peak meal times they're usually full and you're better off walking.Flamingoes, ducks, roosters, hens and peacocks can be seen wandering the fountain pond area near the main lobby. Foolish tourists feed these birds bread they sneak out from the restaurant, but if you respect nature you wouldn't do this.The grounds are well-maintained and in the mornings you usually see the groundskeepers in green uniforms hacking away at the palms, offering you fresh coconuts if you happen to pass them at an opportune moment. You'll also see the maids working all day-I've seen them around from morning into the early evening. They will occasionally leave flowers on your bed or around the posts in your room when they turn it over.Tip: Weekends, especially Saturdays are the busiest - if you can fly in any other day you won't feel lost in the crowd.Food  DrinkThe food is ok, but by no means gourmet or authentic to the island. By this I mean it's quantity over quality, but they do their best to appeal to all tastes. You can see this with the permanent American and Italian stations in the Hispaniola main dining hall. The buffet is extended beachside at the McPrincess walk-up stand and the multi-use El Gaucho dining hall. By day it's a lunch buffet but by evening-night it's a steakhouse or the El Pescola seafood restaurant. A note for folks with hypertension: watch out for over-seasoned dishes. I found the pasta and the paella too salty for my tastes. Also check the chicken - I noticed some pieces were still pink when you cut through them. A note for diabetics: watch out for the cocktails. Yes, they're made generously strong, but after you get over the novelty, they are excessively sugary. Combine that with the heat and sun and you get one exhausting crash.Tip: My cousins liked the fries at McPrincess because they stay crispy, and the hot chocolate at Hispaniola because it had nice spice acccents. I also liked the churros at the American station.OverallThis isn't a singles resort so don't go thinking it'll be one big party like spring break at Cancun or Daytona. I saw a lot of young couples, families and middle-aged folks when I was there. I didn't see any seniors and that's probably because the resort is quite expansive. There's daily activity programming so if you're of the ADHD type there's always some kind of experience awaiting you and your extra payment.The wedding went smoothly and the planner was very accommodating with requests. The beach reception was wonderufl but could have used more lighting around the buffet station. The stars shine brightly above but it's not enough to see what you're eating!Tip: I would advise betrothed couples considering a destination wedding to negotiate having steam pressing included in your package as we found that the dresses took quite some time to do with the steam irons brought by relatives.

<Content>Loved our vacation at the Bavaro Princess! We just returned from a 7 night stay at Bavaro Princess. Our family consists of my husband and I and our 2 sons ages 10 and 11. Let me just say we had a wonderful vacation and we were sad to leave.On our arrival, we were given 2 suites in villa # 03. It was located right by the beach; in fact you could see the ocean from our kids鈥?balcony. I really recommend that building since it鈥檚 so close to the pool and beach and also a bit away from the main path which the trolley uses. ROOMS-I鈥檝e read many reviews about the bad smell in the rooms and found none in ours. The AC was working really well in both rooms and we actually had to turn it to medium since it was really cold. The maid service was good; the mini fridge was replenished every day. We left the maid a few dollars every day in each room and one time she came by in the evening with extra towels even though we never asked for them. There were also no bugs in either one of the rooms. In fact, I didn鈥檛 see any bugs the entire stay there, except for small lizards on the palm trees and the buildings. FOOD- We used the main buffet by the lobby every morning except for one. They have a large variety of food and we all found something we liked. The pineapple is to die for!!! The omelets were very good too!! However the buffet closes at 10 AM. The other buffet, El Gaucho, by the beach opens and closes later but their food selection is very limited. (We used it only once). We made reservations at two restaurants: Sakuro and El Gaucho. We had a wonderful time at Sakuro. Everyone was very attentive, and the food arrived on time. Another story at El Gaucho. We went there on our last evening. We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation and were told to wait until they got a table available. The place was half empty! After 10-15 minutes our table was ready 鈥?and our waiter came to the table asking 鈥渨hat do you want?鈥?I was socked, especially since until then we had nothing to complain about. The food was terrible and the service just as bad. My husband and both sons ordered the sirloin steak which was pretty OK, and I had the T-bone steak which looked and tasted like boiled meat. Couldn鈥檛 take more than a bite. 20 minutes after we finished our entr茅es, the plates were still in front of us and no one was even looking our way. We ended up walking out before the dessert came. They tried to stop us but it was ridiculous. Other tables were having the same problem.The rest of the evenings we went to the main buffet which we enjoyed! They tried to change the theme every day so they had something different each evening.We also went to the Apply BBQ which we really enjoyed. The party was supposed to be on the beach but got moved to Chopin. The food was really good and the restaurant is surrounded by water. During the meal, a boat with a piano player came by and played beautiful music. Very romantic鈥e all enjoyed it.TRIPS- On our arrival we were handed an invitation to the Apple Initiation which is held in the lobby. I鈥檇 recommend you go. The Apple rep was helpful giving tips on which trips are safe, about drinking water, buying from local stores and such. We ended up signing up for the Marinarium Trip. We loved every minute of it!! We were picked up by an air conditioned bus in front of the resort, stopped twice at other resorts to pick more people and went to a different beach. We boarded a catamaran and were taken to a reef where we got to go snorkeling with sharks and stingrays. A very cool experience! Highly recommended.ENTARTAINMENT 鈥?We weren鈥檛 impressed. The main lobby featured a children program in the evening geared towards 3-4 year olds. They tried approaching our kids who flatly refused to do it. They had a band which played good music in the lobby however they kept interrupting it with the kids show. All the people the band had gathered around would leave quickly. PEOPLE: we were impressed by how nice everyone was. They work so hard and try so hard to please you. Our kids were impressed with their kindness and so were we.BEACH 鈥?WONDERFUL !! The beach is amazing! Because it is so wide and long you never feel crowded no matter how many other people are there. There were locals walking by selling jewelry and various trips. They walked away if you told them no and didn鈥檛 insist. The pool was a nice relief from the salty water and they had polo games for kids and adults and other organized games. We found the swim-up bar to be a bit crowded at times, mostly with very young people, so we used the other side of the bar on land which was usually empty. You need to ask for shots of Mama Juana a local drink. 飦?and Coco-Loco. Yumm!!!Both my husband and I traveled to many places before. We went to DR open minded, knowing not to expect world class cuisine and perfect English speaking people. We had a blast the entire time we were there and would highly recommend this place to anyone. As a matter a fact we鈥檝e talked already about returning to Bavaro Princess. Don鈥檛 pay attention to the bad reviews. An open mind and a smile will give you one of your best vacations ever.Regards from Chicago! Whishing we were still on the white sandy beach of Bavaro鈥?/p>

<Content>Loved Bavaro Princess! After reading some of the negative reviews I have a hard time believing that we were at the same resort! We had a fantastic time! We had no problem with check in. Our room, 271, was in a great location and our AC worked so well! The restaurants were good, not great but there was always something to eat. We loved the banana smoothies at breakfast and the mango in the main buffet in the Lobby. When we spoke to Antonio, Henry, or Miguel they always found mango for us, any time of day! They were awesome and really worked so hard. The only thing we were disappointed about was that there was no avocado. Not a big deal just thought I'd mention it. My 2 kids, 8 and 10, are picky eaters and always found something to eat! The beach was beautiful and as previously stated, huge! My husband and son enjoyed the free use of the catamaran and wished they had discovered them sooner. The pool was great and met a lot of nice people there! But the animation team was fantastic! They work so hard and are so much fun! My kids especially loved Cesar! He is very funny! My kids LOVED the mini disco in the evening before the show! We stayed for the shows everynight and no they are not broadway shows but they are entertaining! Every night they have a segment with audience participation and it is really funny. My husband had fun taking part in the show. We really had such a nice relaxing vacation and I would love to return next year! And we saw NO BUGS! Please feel free to contact me with any questions!

<Content>Great Vacation I am going to make this short and sweet. The resort is wonderful and the staff, and the food was excellent. If you can't find something that you like either at the buffet or restaurants you have a big problem. I will say the resort is large, but they have trans that run every 5 minutes and will pick you up on the paths. We walked from the beach (the beach is beautiful ) to the lobby and it was a 15 minute relaxing walk enjoying the sites. I usually stay at the Iberostar Bavaro Punta Cana or Hacienda Dominicus, LaRomana which are smaller resorts, but I would go back to the Bavaro Princess. I have no complaints, I was there from June 23 - June 30. Enjoy and feel free to send me an email

<Content>Beautiful Resort While the resort, pool, facilities and the staff were excellent. The food was o.k. I was expecting wonderful seafood and was very disappointed. Beware everyone of the jewelry store. My friend used her credit card there and found out they duplicated her number and was purchasing items in Florida. I would recommend this resort despite the problems at the jewelry store.

<Content>Great Resort, but not for singles. Let me start out by saying this resort is paradise, but I went to the resort with my 2 sons (16  14) and we were looking for other kids that they could hang out with and the resort was mainly honeymooners,couples and older travelers. I was looking for nightlife and there is no nightlife and everyone goes to bed early. This resort was just not what were were looking for but if you are a couple and want total relaxation then this is the place. Checkout was awesome and I got a great room next to the pool bar and couldn't ask for a better room. The first day I played water polo and I have to warn you to wear water shoes because the bottom of the pool ripped up my feet and I was in pain for about 2 days. The rooms are very nice and plenty of room. Every employee that I spoke with seemed happy at the resort and they work very hard. The gym is very nice for a resort and had modern equipment and plenty of equipment. If anyone has questions please e-mail me.

<Content>Thank you to everyone here for a great stay We just returned from the Bavaro Princess June 17 - 24 2008 and i must say what a great week. I wont drag out this review too much, you can contact me for anything specific you want to know. my advice is to go enjoy your time get to know the staff and animation team their sole job is to help you relax and have fun. participate when they ask you will have fun. Check in was quick and easy.The room was awesome no problemsThe beach was amazing largest of all surrounding resorts .Buffet had plenty of variety for everyone.Bella pasta Italian very goodEl Gaucho Steak not Outback but goodTanuki Japanes Steakhouse was great a definite redo when we go back.A side note about the reservation restaurants..men must wear pants and that includes teenagers, don't be a pain and think you are going to change that rule deal with it, it does not hurt you.Staff was outstanding and i mean everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful. HOLA to all.The Animation Team deserves a special recognition for all their hard work from 9 am to midnight everyday with just one job..to entertain you. they do a great job, get to know these guys their great.Go enjoy yourself and leave all attitudes at home they won't work here and all you miserable people do is annoy everybody else. If you don't have patience stay home this time next year that way i am guaranteed a reservation spot with no problem..A Domincan minute is anything but a minute, so where are you in a hurry to go didn't you get away for a change of pace?I saw people who could adapt and have a great time and I saw people who were miserable with life in general. they will write bad reviews just because the sun came up or the wind blew today. Open your mind to the island lifestyle your on vacation enjoy. People asked us all week how we got waited on so fast over others. this is how I figured it, we saved a bunch of money by going here so with what i would have tipped at restaurants and places on vacation in the states i just gave to the people i thought did a great job there. contact for more info and to all we saw there remember BUBBA SPORT MUGS RULE!!!!

<Content>Little boring, marginal food! This was my wife and my first all inclusive. We were encouraged to go by friends who had been to Punta Cana, but not this resort. The beaches were very nice, but only a single bar was open making for long lines for drinks. Soft drinks were selfserve but only in 10oz plastic cups. By the time you got to your lounger the drink and the ice were gone. I would suggest buying a couple of those big plastic 7-11 type mugs so you aren't making constant trips just for a soda and ice. Also if you are a prude, then stay away from the beach, as you may see more than you wish to see.Food was a constant chore, there was no 24 food available except through room service. Lunch was from 7am to 10am, lunch 1pm to 4pm, and dinner 7pm to 10pm. There was a hamburger hut on the beach, which was open from about 11am to 7 pm. Lunch and breakfast was open seating at two of the seven restaurants. Dinner at 5 of the restaurants was by reservation only. I could only recommend the asian and hibachi restaurant. Food ranged from awful to average, we didn't have a single meal that was memorable for being good, just not bad.The casino was pitiful. A few tables, and some used slot machines. We went once and were the only non-employees there. The staff tended to hover too much for my taste.The nightly show was junior high quality with lip-syncing and mediocre skits. Many people left a minutes into the performance each night. We were there for a week and only lasted 1 full performance.We took an excursion into the countryside which we enjoyed the so called Jungle Safari. Lots of rum on a rocky truck so beware (not for kids).The rooms were the best part of the experience (always demand a 2nd floor room, the 1st floor rooms may have been flooded). They were large, with cable tv, good air conditioning and a minibar. A couple of dollars and a note in spanish each day got extra cokes and beers in the fridge. While most people did not tip we found a few dollars here and there were very much appreciated.Shopping outside the resort gates was awful, you were pounced on as soon as you left the premises. There was an irregular shuttle bus to a mall, but it was just expensive. The was an optional bus tour for shopping, but I don't know if it was worth it. One night while we were there the resort supposedly allow the locals to come in to pedal their goods. But as it was all barcoded I have some suspicions as to how local it was.I found myself bored to death after 2 days, and unless you are a beach person I think you will as well. The resort gave itself 5 stars I would only give it two, one for the room and one for the beach.

<Content>Don't do it...Head the warnings and bad reviews...Book somewhere else! My wife and I booked our honeymoon through a travel agent in our area with Apple Vacations. The price seemed more than fair and by the personal recommendation of the travel agent we booked our honeymoon to the Bavaro Princess Resort in Punta Cana. We paid for the platinum upgrade, which as explained to us, would entitle us to premium alcohol, nicer room, extra nice meals and other amenities. Upon arriving at our resort, we were taken to the platinum lounge were we proceeded to wait for two hours before we could check in to our room. Now, we do understand that people may have checked out of that room late, but after observing how slow the housekeeping was during the week, we are guessing that was the cause. After waiting over two hours for our room to be ready, we went to the room to find it in what had appeared to be immaculate condition right down to the label on the toilet suggesting it was sanitized. Considering my wife is a clean freak, she inspected the toilet before going to the bathroom to find that there was HUMAN FICIES still smeared on and around the sanitized toilet. Outraged, we called the platinum lounge to express our concern and they assured us that someone would be over right away to re-clean it. Several phone calls later and several hours having passed, a maid did finally show up to clean said toilet. A few hours later we spent some time killing huge cock roaches that seemed to come out of the wood work near the TV and couches. We expressed our concern about these issues to the apple rep at our resort and he assured us he would take care of it. He did offer to have our room exterminated but we would not be able to be in it for several hours after. Several hours later and several times of reminding him that we were waiting to hear back from him, he informed us that the manager was going to send Champaign to our room for the inconvenience. The FOLLOWING DAY, our 10 dollar bottle of Champaign arrived with a small cheese plate. This behind us, we proceeded to enjoy the rest of our honeymoon. The food at the resort restaurants was absolutely terrible. My wife and I both got sick from something we either ate or drink; as did several other couples we met throughout our time there. The restaurants that were included as part of our platinum upgrade were worse then the buffet food in the main dining room. We paid for the platinum upgrade especially to receive the premium alcohol, and every time we asked for anything to be considered premium, they were out of it. We didn't get anything premium until we went to the bar at one of the sister resorts we were allowed to go to. We booked two excursions with apple by recommendation of the reps at the resort, which were the outback safari and the dolphin island. The outback safari was well worth our time and money and we enjoyed that day immensely. The dolphin island excursion was a different story. This excursion costs $110 a person, which is steep to begin with. What a racket this excursion is. The entire trip is supposed to be 5 hours and it was five and a half hours. The bad thing is that only an hour of it was spent actually near the dolphins. The trip to and from the island took over 30 minutes each way. We spent an hour waiting to go out to the water after arriving. The hour with the dolphins was amazing to say the least. We were taken back to the beach where they proceeded to sell us DVDs with photos from our experience. This privilege cost us another 30 bucks. After waiting another half hour we received our DVD and then proceeded to wait over two hours for them to organize everyone to get back on the buses to return to the resort. Several people were complaining to the staff but it seemed the staff was only concerned with making sure everyone bought a DVD before getting back on the buses. I had read some reviews about this resort prior to traveling there and the most popular complaint was regarding transportation issues. The resort is set on a few acres and it is a bit of a walk from the beach to the main lobby or from the rooms to the buffet. The resort has a vehicle that stops at several designated areas to pick people up. Nine times out of ten this vehicle was full by the time it reached us so we decided to walk the rest of our time there. This proved to be a bad idea since the road to walk on went through an area where the resort had a sewage problem. I can鈥檛 even describe how bad the stench was in this area. They even had caution tape around the majority of the area. I am sure walking past this area four times a day on average was not good for our overall health. The night before leaving we paid our bill so we could have express check out in the morning before our departure. I asked guest services when I should call in the morning to have our baggage picked up so we could have time to eat before our bus came. They informed us that ten minutes we be sufficient. The morning came and just to be on the safe side I called them 45 minutes prior to our scheduled departure time from the resort. 35 minutes later, they finally showed up to grab our baggage and we raced to the main lobby to catch our bus. We had no time to eat and it was the perfect ending to a miserable vacation.

<Content>Loved it....beautiful place We just returned from a week long stay.....it was one of the most fun and relaxing vacations we've ever had. The beach was amazing. After breakfast each morning it was to the beach, where we would stay all day long. I had been worried about the weather. I had looked on weather.com before leaving and it said 30 - 60% chance of thunderstorms each day. It never rained!!!! Beautiful weather. The service in the ala carte places were a little slow but, who cares???? You're on vacation. The food was worth waiting for. The buffet always had something for all. The omlettes and the fresh donuts each morning were wonderful. The staff all worked so hard. They all had smiles on their faces and were always willing to try and help you. We had a slight problem with check in but it was quickly corrected. They accidently put us in a room that was occupied by someone else. That could have been very very interesting. LOL..... It is a very big place...we really didn't have a problem with the trams. Very clean. A little musty smelling in the room. But, what do you expect? Take a room freshener. That's what we did. Also, just a hint......take a night light. It gets very dark in the room at night. The only thing I would change is not to book the Honeymoon package (for us....we've been married 15 years). It had a lot of nice perks, but it was really far from the beach. Next time, I would try and get closer. We met a lot of nice people that I hope we keep in touch with. Hope you had a nice trip home. (you know who you are..LOL)I can't wait to go back. I miss it already.Teri

<Content>Family Vacation Just got back from our Family Vacation in Punta Cana at the Bavaro Princess Resort. My family which consists of 2 adults and 2 girls ages 5 and 10 decided to travel to DR for total relaxation. It is hard traveling with kids and we wanted a peaceful time. That's we got!!!For those of you traveling with kids: You should know that the main show is at 10:00p.m and even though we tried to get our kids to nap during the day, they were still to tired from all the sun to want to go to the shows. They do have a kids mini-show at 8:00p.m but it is geared more to younger kids like 1-4 years old. My kids also went to the kids club once during the day for just one hour and did not want to go back but I attribute it to that fact that they wanted to be with us. They did say that one of the ladies (Alexandra) insisted that they do their arts and crafts exactly like the sample and did not allow them to be creative. I don't have a problem with this as I am a teacher and certain procedures are in place for a reason. There is also a preserve area that they call a mini-zoo. It really is just a nature trail along a wooden walkway and in the middle there is an aviary and a holding cell for all their giant iguanas. Throughout the day, the photo staff walks around with parrots, snakes, and a tiny monkey. They photograph you for free holding the animals and then display the photos at a central location so you can purchase them for $12 each if you want. The kids just wanted to hold the animals but the photos came out really good so we couldn't resist. The casino was off limits because the kids were not allowed in and the kids club was closed during the open hours of the casino. The room was wonderful. We were in #831 which was right next to the Platinum Clubhouse and tram stop which comes by every 3-5 minutes and is a must since the campus is so large. The adults got a king bed and each child got their own bed (one a double sized pull-out sofa and the other a twin bed). This is a really awesome plus for those of you who have ever experienced the fights between siblings sharing a bed! Even though there were 3 beds in the room, we were not crowded at all. The bathrooms were always properly stocked and the hot water never ran out. The mini-fridge had plenty of drinks which were replenished everyday. The air conditioner worked better than at home and the ceiling fan was an added bonus.The food was plentiful and the variety pleased the entire family. I like the restaurants over the buffets usually because it's less work for a MOM, but I have to say, the Hispaniola buffet was great! The staff at all the restaurants were very considerate and careful with my husbands severe allergies to seafood. We didn't get to go to Chopin because it was closed for renovations. Sakuri was not our favorite and El Gaucho was not what I expected. I ordered the mixed grill and was not impressed as the so called sausage was more like a hot dog. But my daughter got the T-Bone and it was fantastic. Tanuki, Bella Pasta, and El Pescador were far superior to what I expected.I had been to DR before on a family trip to Puerta Plata and was so discouraged by the staff members, security issues, and accommodations that we stayed away for 3 years. I am so glad I gave the DR another chance. The staff here were so incredibly kind. They appreciate their jobs and it shows. We tipped everyone that we approached but I truly believe we would have received the same excellent service even if we hadn't.We were approached by a Time-Share type vacation salesperson. It was a little annoying but we went to their presentation for about 30 minutes and got some free gifts out of it. We were just stern and told them that there was nothing that they could say to get us to buy anything so they didn't waste our time or theirs.Sunscreen and Bug spray are a must! I get bit wherever I go and I certainly got bit here, but by no means was it that bad. We constantly wondered how they keep everything so beautiful as we rarely saw workers in the gardens.Some of the reviews we read prior to going left us worried and the photos of the roaches, well I don't know where those came from because we didn't see any at all. Maybe those people are just pigs!We had a fabulous time and have no complaints at all. We would return in a heartbeat!

<Content>Great Time at Bavaro Princess We just returned from a 9 day stay at Bavaro Princess. I went with an open mind as I have read both good and bad reviews and realize these are opinions. Well, here is mine. We were taken to our suite as soon as we arrived. The lady at the check-in desk said to let her know if we weren't happy with the room and she would see what she could do. We were honestly thrilled with it. I started to upgrade but decided to wait and see. We were in room 833 which was maybe a 2 minute walk to the beach. It is a large resort and I realize we wouldn't be close to everything. That's what the tram was for. Occasionally, it was full but I would just walk and explore til the next one came. We had a king size bed and lots of space so we didn't feel crowded when we were in the room. The beach, needless to say, was incredible. They kept it as clean as possible. What I found sad was how people constantly threw their cigarettes, cups, etc...down with the attitude that someone is hired to cleanup. I live in Maryland. Our beaches stink probably thanks to this way of thinking. Just because we are on vacation doesn't mean we can't put our trash in a can or give it to the man who walked around collecting it. Yes, there were people trying to sell souvenirs, parasailing, snorkeling, etc. All I told them was no thank you and eventually they just spoke everyday as they passed by. Another easy way is to either say you have no money or just ignore them as they walk by. I enjoyed many of the conversations and learned some interesting facts about the island from them. I spent a few days alone on the beach as my boyfriend took a scuba course. I was not bothered or made uncomfortable in anyway. The animation team had activities to participate in if desired. It was very peaceful and relaxing for me.  The animation team worked hard to make sure everyone had a good time. I went to relax so I mostly watched but you have to give them credit for being so active all day long in that heat.  The food was fine for us. I am the picky one but had no problem finding something I liked. We went to some of the various restaurants and something positive can be said for all. The staff were always attentive to our needs and usually anticipated them even in the buffett. I never had any stomach problems while I was there. I tried to eat sensibly and stayed well hydrated and limited my alcohol intake. I usually ate 2-3 meals and a snack of course. lol.  I usually get bit no matter where I am by some type of bug. I used Off with deet and managed to only get 4 bites in 9 days. Can I complain? NO! Yes, I saw a few small bugs in the room. My boyfriend made coffee and spilled a little sugar. That can happen anywhere. I am terrified of bugs and I really was pleased by how few I encountered. We loved walking the grounds as it's a huge complex. It is not for everyone. I see people complain about how big it is. Well, 90+ acres is huge. You're not going to be conveniently located to everything. I walked many days from the beach to the lobby. We explored the paths that took us past alot of different birds. We fed peacocks, ducks, chickens. Saw vultures in a cage. We watched the lizards on the trees and the fish in the ponds. It was great. I'm trying to think of something to complain about but I really can't when it comes to the resort. What I can complain about is how people forget to be considerate of others by smoking in close areas, throwing trash everywhere, rushing to get on the tram like it's the end of the earth and not paying attention to the elderly or children. It is a vacation. It is meant to be fun and I realize most have spent alot of money and feel entitled to do what they please but let's try to remember others have spent the same money and deserve a little respect. Vacation is what you make it. Thanks Bavaro Princess for making this one of the best I have had!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Great Hotel A+++++++++++++++ I stayed here with my boyfriend in Jan 0'8, after reading the mixed reviews I was very nervous. Once we stepped off the Applevacations shuttle, I knew this will be a great vacation. The hotel is very beautiful, and big. There is so much to see when walking around the property. Our room was great close to the beach and pool, and close to to El Gaucho restaurant and the buffet. The food was great everywhere, the rooms were very clean and no weird smells or bugs. People complained in previous reviews that the maids took a long time to get their room, I'm sorry but the hotel is 96-acres do you expect everything to be cleaned within an hour? We would come back to our room around 3pm and everything was already clean, or almost done. STop stressing over the small things its your vacation relax. Check in and check out was great no problems what so ever. The staff is great, everyone was nice and polite. Some people complained that not everyone spoke English, did they realize they were going to a place where English is not really spoken and that Spanish is their language? Many do know English but not all, and you can still communicate with the staff. I have nothing to complain about and do not understand why people pick the smallest details and let that ruin their whole vacation.

<Content>bavaro princess; not all that great just got back from a 4-day vacation at the bavaro princess. the only word that i can think of to describe my stay is 'eh'. i was in punta cana last year but stayed in a different resort, which i thought at the time was a nice place. however after staying at the bavaro princess i realized how amazing and great the other place was. i found myself comparing the two..and to be honest the cons outweighed the pros for bavaro princess.pros: -very clean place.-welcoming.-nice big pool. the swim up bar was pretty neat.-lots of beach area.-the activities people were very nice and friendly. the games and events by the beach and pool were always very fun and entertaining.cons: -the place was entirely too big. to get from the lobby to the beach is about a 20 minute walk.-there are trams that come about every 5-10 minutes but most of the time they are full and you have to end up walking.-the pathways are lighted but it's still pretty dark at night and they aren't wide enough for the trams to get through if people are walking on them.-the lobby buffet and the beach buffet are both open buildings. which means there are alot of flies and bugs that fly around on the open food. it's gross.-i was eaten alive by all the mosquitos. and yes i sprayed bugspray 24/7 but still managed to get bitten.-the airconditioning in our suite wasn't working too well. it was cool but not cool enough to stop us from sweating.-the casino  the club (which is in the casino) is not in the resort. which means you have to take the tram to get there and it's open to locals, which is kind of sketch/shady.-laying on the beach is relaxing until you get 3468 guys asking you if want to parasail/bananaboat or buy from their suitcases, which is very annoying and aggravating.so as you can see the bavaro princess, in my opinion, wasn't all that great. i would recommend looking/going to a different resort before ever going to this one.

<Content>Nice place,lots of inconsistencies After reading the current reviews, I'm not sure I stayed at the same place as these other people! We stayed at the Bavaro Princess from May 17-24, 2008 with the Platinum upgrade. This is our 5th trip the Punta Cana, the past 4 trips staying at Grand Palladium Bavaro. I am fairly well travelled, having been a travel agent in the past.The ONLY reason we decided to go somewhere other than GPB was to branch out and see what another hotel complex was like. Our stays at GPB have been consistently amazing. I was just wanting to experience something different, but still have the wonderful Bavaro beach and ocean! So, much of this review will compare between the 2 hotels, because that's what I know and can give my opinion on.First, this is a VERY large complex--92 acres is a lot of ground! However I would walk the large grounds at GPB, and I could get to the lobby from the beach in under 10 minutes. Here it is a good 25 minutes walk. Therefore you use the tram car to get back and forth. It is very bumpy and sometimes the drivers are as crazy as the drivers on the main roads! Getting a seat can also be a challenge as people are ready to pounce on an empty seat, especially at the lobby stop. Also after midnight these trams stop. We were able to get a cart ride from someone at the front entrance to the hotel , but I don't know if that was just because I showed him my Platinum bracelet. Platinum upgrade here is most certainly worth it for the service, the room location, and the extras you get included. The amount you would pay for the cost of the massage, the motorized watersport, the dinner at Licey and have room service once or twice-it covers the upgrade cost. You get premium alcohol upgrade as well. However that only helps if they have the premium alcohol you want. I could not get Bacardi Rum there, altho if I drank Scotch, I could get Chivas Regal. Also altho only Platinum members are supposed to be able to get the premium alcohol, I did see others order premium drinks at the bar and they got it no questions, even tho they did not have Platinum wristbands. The wristbands are nice for Platinum too-a string bracelet as opposed to the plastic amusement park type wristbands everyone else gets. All the other extras of being Platinum are gravy above that. Also I would say that if I did not have the Platinum upgrade I would not reccomend this hotel at all.There are many inconsistencies in the service and the food here. The time of year we travel is the start of the off season. I don't know if there were less staff or what, but I found the way we were treated to range from wonderful to indifferent. I also felt that I was in off season--something I never experienced at GPB. This feeling came from several different things. Certain alacartes we wanted to go to were shut down-one, which I had been looking forward to as a romantic surprize for my boyfriend on his birthday dinner--Chopin-is supposed to have a boat come by with a piano player, and at times a singer. This floats by you as you eat. Well the night we went, we had reservations at 8 and were there till at least 1030--no boat, no piano-nothing.The boat is supposed to go by around 830. We couldn't booked Mare Nostrum as that was reserved for a private party the night we wanted it(understandable), and the Tanuki restaurant was just plain closed. After reading others reviews about these places, you want to experience them too, and then nope, you can't. We did eat at El Gaucho--tooooo noisy, busy and food just okay. Beef all over hotel was generally tough. Chopin-thought as an alacarte we would be served, but this was buffet(apparently an off season thing), Mamma mia was wonderful, delicious food and servers who bent over backwards. Licey--even if you do not have Platinum, pay the $35 to eat here-it is well worth it. I wish our reservations had been for the begining of the week instead of our last night. I would have paid again and again to eat there! Do not miss it! I was leary to go with the filet mignon after eating beef at the other restaurants--but it was to die for--Cut it with a butter knife and it melted in your mouth! As to the buffets I enjoy a good breakfast-but after the 1st few days I rarely bothered to make the trip, it wasn't worth it. From my experience, it seems if you get something cooked to order at a buffet it was good, but pretty much anything else really did not have the right taste-I can't even tell you what the scrambled eggs on the buffet were made with because they certainly did not taste like any eggs I have ever eaten. The sausage was the same way. But a freshly made omelette was delicious. Also, there were not many choices on the buffets. The GPB had about 5 times as many choices there as we found here. And believe me, I am not picky nor a connosieur or gourmet, I cannot stress that enough so you will understand I'm not being picky here. I just want something that tastes good and is edible. Also, even tho I am pretty careful about what I eat there so as to avoid any stomach upsets, I still had 2 days with sour stomach and extra bathroom trips. Unfortunately I also spoke with a group of 6 other guests staying in the Platinum area who ate at Chopin the same evening we did and got very sick with vomiting and diarrhea. Apparently they all had the salmon, which we did not.Room service was very good. We had breakfast and omelettes and eggs over easy were hot. However, it took 1 hour 30 minutes and 2 phone calls to get. People we met said they had room service breakfast in 25 minutes(the menu states 40 minute wait time.) Also did not like that I had to call room service for ice in room(never came). There is a set-up in the room to make cocktails, but no ice. I don't want to wait 40 minutes to have a drink. GPB has ice machineshacks every few buildings, and you serve yourself whenever you wish. All in all the food was a big dissapointment to me as I was never sure if something I was choosing would make me ill or plain just not taste good and there wouldn't be enough choices to get something else. Believe me, I never had that problem at GPB. I think is the first vacation I ever lost weight. I will say a lot more staff here understand English, and there were also a lot more visitors here who spoke English than at GPB. We met a lot more people here, just striking up conversations as we went thru our day. The staff had a lot of inconsistencies in how they reacted to guests. In the Platinum lounge, we asked for a change of the rum from dark to light in our room,not a problem, they gave us a full bottle of Barcelo Blanco for the room. Another Platinum guest asked to switch out the El Presidente beers in his fridge with Coronas, and was treated rudely. We had wonderful experiences at GPB-even having one waiter call us by name our 2nd year as we walked into the restaurant on our first evening. When you passed a worker at GPB- always an Hola! and a smile. At the Princess-very few were like that. It seemed that for the most part these people were not happy to be there. In the buffet-not one server spoke to us or made us feel welcome anymore than they had to in order to bring us what we needed. We did see others have great waiters, who joked and laughed with them. We are easy going people who will get into conversations with just about anyone. And it wasn't that others had all great experiences and we didn't. We would experience this individually and also at times when people we met there were with us. It was difficult to get a waitress to bring drinks in the lobby. She would take used glasses, get an order from all of us, and then never return. Tipping which we do often did not seem to make a difference.I did not like the lobby here. At GPB it was much more open and airy. Also in the evenings there was a band playing slow dance music. It was very pleasant to sit there-You could speak with whomever you were with and not have to shout. There were very nice inside and outside spaces to enjoy a drink. At the Princess- the show is right off the lobby. It is very loud and distracting. You are constantly saying what did you say?Oh one major thing I did not like--As we sat on our balcony we were just enjoying the breeze midday and the maids were cleaning. We noticed this day they were going to the pond by the Platinum lounge and filling their cleaning buckets. Okay well hmmm, I guess thats okay to mop the floor(but still alittle icky--you know pond scum and all). We watched as the maid not only had first dipped the mop and cleaned the floor, then she took a rag into the bucket, wrung it out and cleaned glasses for the room. OH MY! needless to say we didnt use the glasses in our room again! This did turn out to be a day when we found out a little later that for some reason the water was not working, only discovering that because the toilet wasn't flushing(and of course on one of the days when I needed extra bathroom trips!) Apparently this was all over the hotel, as we tried to use the bathroom off the lobby with the same result. By late day tho we were able to get showers. Yet no one seemed very disturbed by this or saw cause to say anything to the guests about it that we could tell.I did have a nice vacation there, but that's all it was--nice. Not amazing.I try and make the best of whatever situation, but I was very disappointed here. After this long winded review, my opinion is that I loved the Platinum Service part of this hotel, without it I wouldn't ever stay there.But I don't think I would go back there though because of the food, it needs to be greatly improved. If GPB had a Platinum service available like that oh I would never leave there!

<Content>Big Mistake If anyone is trying to make the decision whether to stay at Bavaro Princess---DON'T!!!! I got on travel advisors and there was enough pictures and negative things that I wish I had listened to them but I was stupid and listened to those that would say the oppisite and convince me that the people writting were just negative people...They weren't, believe me I've went to Punta Cana 6 times and always stayed in a 5 or 6 Apple Resort and I know the difference..Bavaro Princess should be rated no more than a 3.. My friend and I arrived there May the 12th and the Bell Boys took our luggage and showed us where to catch the tram and we waited and waited just like people had said we would..We finally walked to our room which hadn't been cleaned, I turned the tv on to see if we got any Latin music because I love it and the tv wasn't working.. the maid reported it,,then after she left we was looking the room over,,sure enough like we had been advised,,there was bugs, mildew on the walls, and the light in the bathroom wouldn't work..I called to report that and then we got ready to go eat..We went out to the tram stop and waited again for 10 minutes and finally the tram came,,,FULL,,we finally walked and it was a long walk, believe me,,I was told about the sewage smell but again didn't believe it,,I do now,,it was terrible..dinner was good until later when I was running to the bathroom often, it was too dark in the main lobby and we went to the show which was a magic show, very boring. Well we decided to go in, get some sleep and start over tomorrow..no tv and no light in the bathroom,,luckily I took a flashlight. The next morning I was so sick I couldn't eat breakfast and soon after breakfast my friend was sick..We went to Apple and ask to be moved..After checking around, they found us a great resort and we moved..Please if you're thinking about going look some more..I'm really upset that Apple would rate this place a 5 as bad as it was...I'm sure if these people that give great reviews had been to any other resorts they'd realize that Bavaro Princess has a lot of problems..Our vacation was ruined from getting an enzyme or poisoned the first day..I go to enjoy everything,,always look foward to the food, drinks, entertainment,,I missed all of that and was moved to a fabulous resort but was too sick. Don't be pulled in by the good price like I did,,I regretted it. I hope you'll listen to me..Thanks Susan

<Content>Wonderful stay  This was our fourth trip to Bavaro Princess, and my husband and I decided to celebrate our tenth anniversary with a renewal of our vows. We stayed from May 3rd to 18th with the usual gang - our friends who always go with us each year, a group of nine in total. And the group included a 3 yr old, 7 yr old and 8 yr old.To begin with, since we've been returning for four years, you know we have definitely not had any negative experiences at BP. We have been to Sandals/Beaches in Cuba, and Casa Del Mar in La Romana previously. Food: I eat everything here. The food is terrific. Specifically, we love the fresh donuts and baking (the banana bread in am is amazing), the fresh fruits and fruit juices, and the variety at the restaurants. I won't eat buffet food at home - cold, dry, nasty - but BP has it mastered. Plus, the fresh food stations-crepes, eggs, pasta, stir frys, are a bonus. The only time anyone gets sick is when my friend gets sick as she does every year we go away (she also gets sick at home when she eats rich foods...) The a la carte restaurants are good, generally speaking. The food was fine, although we had issues with service at a couple: Bella Pasta staff were, I think, trying to be formal, but came across as standoffish. As soon as we started trying to make the champagne pouring napkin- and the staff started laughing and coming to help us- then they were warm and pleasant. On our second visit, they remembered us and were relaxed and friendly. ElGaucho was similar. Sakura had a new manager and the service was very slow. I mean, below BP's standard for sure. In fact. my husband actually spoke to the manager about the need to get the kitchen on line (waiters were great, very attentive, but main course took 1 hr 25 min to appear). What we loved was: Tanuki, the new tappanyaki restaurant - so much fun! great staff - and Chopin, again, great staff, Jose, the head chef was visible and very personable. El pescador and Licey were both very good, with good service and food. The buffet was consistently good. The variety is good and themes were fun: American, Spanish, Italian, Asian, Dominican, International and Mexican.Kids Club: Our kids loved the club. We have 3 social workers in the group and kept close tabs on the kids. They all went regularly. They did archery, tennis, crafts, swimming, ping pong, soccer (football) and acting. Vow Renewal: This went off without a hitch. I was worried that this would take up a lot of vacation time, but it really didn't. Franciella met with us once to go over details and then supervised ceremony and checked on reception. She ensured all was wonderful. The day was great, and lots of fun. Even when her assistant came to make sure I got the bouquet and discovered I was still in a swimsuit 40 minutes before ceremony...I thought she was going to faint! (For the record, I was still ready 5 minutes early) The ceremony was lovely, and toast time was great. Our friend brought his ipod speakers and played our favorite music. The only damper was that we had dinner at Sakura and it was, as I mentioned so slow. We rushed through the main course and cut the cake (which was vanilla and very very tasty) as the kids had a date with the club staff at the mini disco. the night of the ceremony, the turn down service housekeeper made elaborate decorations in the room with flowers everywhere. It was beautiful.As returning guests we received special bracelets, bathrobes, slippers, t shirts, a bottle of rum and fruit basket. Quite a few of the staff recognized us and spent time talking with us about work  family. There were some noticeable improvements this year: bottled water was available everywhere, schedules for housekeeping of rooms was more consistent, kids club had a daily schedule and when you dropped kids off you were told what the plan was for am/pm. There were plenty of loungers, and palapas were usually available. The shows were more varied and had a Cuban magician one week, and shorter dance numbers for other shows. Much better than endless dialogue in 5 languages and lipsynching. The house band was terrific. Seriously enjoyable. I understand a number of the veteran staff have left for newer resorts, so there are a lot of new managers and there is a new general manager to ensure the resort stays competitive. We met a lot of families who were experiencing Bp for the first time and checked our opinions against theirs. While no place is perfect, this was an outstanding vacation with seasoned staff and a well run resort.

<Content>Fantastic Vacation for a great price! We stayed at the Bavaro Princess April 29th through May 6. It was our first time ever in Punta Cana. The resort grounds were absolutely beautiful and impeccably clean.We arrived late Tuesday night and after seeing our room (near the lobby) we immediately upgraded to the Platinum/VIP package. HUGE difference in rooms - the new room was located steps away from the beach and a stone throw away from the actual Platinum lounge which offers premium liquors as well as movie rentals and free internet access. Snacks through out the day are also available in this area. The staff were phenomenal. Yes, there is a language barrier but this caused no frustration on our part, you make the most of it and everyone makes a good effort to try and help you and understand. Just remember, you are on vacation, in THEIR country. We read some bad reviews about this place - about the food being terrible, about bugs and musty odours... I can honestly say the food was fantastic everywhere we ate! The selection of fruit was mouth watering with sooo much flavour. The grilled lobster and shrimp at Chopin was excellent! The selection at the buffets was fantastic. Great variety of foods for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We never had any problems with any of the food at the many restaurants and buffets. I don't know what people were referring to when they complained about bugs and mosquitoes..yes we got some mosquito bites but you get those anywhere, especially after it rains...it certainly was not as bad or even close to what some people wrote. Our room never had that musty smell so I cannot comment...but is that not normal especially when its humid out? I think the problem is that when some people go away on vacation they forget that they are in a less developed country. I don't have anything negative to say about this resort. All the staff - from gardeners out in the morning tending to the flowers and trees to bartenders and maids, everyone always greeted us with a friendly welcoming smile. Johanny from check in was superb in ensuring we were content with our upgrade and called often to make sure we were happy. I would recommend the upgrade to anyone, for the room alone it was well worth it..never mind all the other perks you get with the upgrade such as bathrobes and slippers (soo comfy), cigars, 20 minute massage by the pool which was absolutely wonderful (they definately know how to massage) 1 hour of free snorkeling (they take you out on a boat - so don't pay for it if you are approached on the beach). You also get to eat at the neighbouring Princess resorts - which we never did as we were quite content with our resort. You also get Free room service 24 hours a day which we took advantage of quite a bit . Platinum staff made reservations for us at Licey (if you're not part of Platinum, you pay 30 dollars to eat here). Licey was an upscale restaurant with fantastic menu options. I had the lobster and it was amazing...The beach was absolutely breathtaking...powdery soft sand, no rocks whatsoever....the water...very refreshing and picturesque. Three of us (girls) traveled here and never found this place to be unsafe in any way. Maybe some people should stay off the mamajuana.... All in all, we had a fantastic time here. I'm not a fan of vacationing more than once at the same destination but would return back here in a heartbeat.Hope this review helps....remember, take the negative you read with a grain of salt, there is just no pleasing some people and I don't find it fair to do this place injustice. Relax and enjoy.....From the T Dot

<Content>overall dissapointment We booked this trip through Apple Vacations and overall I was very dissappointed in the resort. The main reason is that Apple bills this as a 5 apple property whereas I see it as a 4 at best. The rooms are terribly dated and in need of remodel. We had lots of tiny bugs in our room (on the bathroom sink and the headboard). The pool area also needs to be updated. Everywhere we went was smoky with lots of cigarette butts laying around. The beach and water were beautiful and the food was good.

<Content>Bavaro Princess - Beautiful Resort!!! My husband and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from 26 April to 3 May. The Resort was breathtakingly beautiful and we had a wonderful vacation. We booked through Sunwing who book you into what they call 'junior suites.' We were leary of these rooms after reading other reviews and tried to upgrade prior to departure. Our travel agent advised us to wait and see what the rooms were like before doing an upgrade. We took the advice but ended up upgrading once we saw them. The junior suites are located as far from the beach as you can get and the room they gave us did not have a terrace or a balcony. We upgraded immediately and got a beautiful suite close to the beach. Yes, they are a little on the older side and there is a musty smell but they are very spacious, quite pretty, and are kept very clean by the extremely hard working staff. We had a nice balcony where we sat to have our morning coffee and relaxed in the late afternoons and in the evenings after dinner. The grounds, restaurants, and beach are all beautiful. The staff are friendly and helpful. We did find the language a bit of a barrier...but we managed! We saw no bugs... not even mosquitos! I didn't need to use bug spray at all! It was extremely hot and humid while we were there. We had a lot of sunshine and a couple of overcast days which were rather welcome after getting sunburned! We used SPF 30 and had to switch to 45 when 30 didn't even seem to cut it! It poured rain a couple of times but the rain didn't last and it came either in the evening or early in the morning. I recommend carrying an umbrella when you head out to dinner as the rain can roll in rather quickly! The food was pretty good. It was always easy to find something to eat with the large selection of restaurants and food choices available. We walked the beach and thought that our resort had the nicest one we saw. We took the 'Caribbean Festival' excursion which was awesome! It is a half day excursion where you get to snorkel at a coral reef and swim with sharks and stingrays. There is entertainment, snacks, and drinks provided on the boat. It was an amazing time and I highly recommend the experience. It also allows you to get a glimpse of the real Dominican Republic. It was an eye-opener to see the poverty, slums, and garbage that was just outside the gates. There are alot of beach venders trying to sell their wares 'cheapy! cheapy!' We bought a couple of things but if you just shake your head 'no' they pretty much leave you alone. We left a tip for our maid every day and tipped at restaurants and bars. These people work very hard and deserve to be rewarded for their efforts. I also left gifts for the maid each day but next time I will just leave money. We never reserved chairs on the beach and didn't have any problem finding available ones when we looked. The house band provided good entertainment up at the lobby in the evenings and the drinks were always tasty (I liked the coco locos, pina coladas, and merengues!). You do have to request alcohol in some varieties of drinks as they'll give you 'virgin' ones if you don't. We both got the infamous runs but we took our meds and carried on! The resort is huge but there is a trolley available if you don't feel like walking. My husband and I walked everywhere. It only took a few minutes to walk from the beach to the lobby and the grounds are so beautiful to walk through both during the day and at night. I highly recommend this resort. You just have to keep in mind that it is a foreign, tropical country where the lifestyle and climate is very different from ours. We thoroughly enjoyed our Dominican vacation. Just embrace the whole experience and you're in for a great time!!

<Content>Nice Place but not a 5 stars hotel palace We stayed there 2 weeks .This is a huge hotel , with more than 1500 employees. You can see all sort of animals walking around the park of the hotel.But the less funny were to have spiders in our room , 4 times ! Otherwise hote were very clean , park , swimming pool, restaurant, beach...Things to improove: 1/we are in a beautifull island where sun is shinning everyday , its very sad to have a so dark room, just one window for this very spacious room.2/not enought changes for the buffet but we have the right to go on several other restaurant of the hotel where food is simply very delicious.

<Content>Worst service I've ever had Just returned from 5 days at the Bavaro Princess Resort.We have travelled extensively around the world and a lot in the Carribean. We love to mix with locals when possible and really enjoy the culture. Unfortunately, Punta Cana does not make that very feasible. The place is filthy dirty, runned down and generally not safe for tourists. The grounds of the resort were very nice, however really needed better upkeep. The rooms were in dire need of upgrade renovations.The resort offered a Platinum Package which Vacations to Go were not aware of. However I was able to negotiate that when I arrived. The package gives you access to premium liquors (or all they have is no name brands) it allows you free internet access, slipper and robes in your room and clean beach towels delivered to your room daily. Also entrance to the specialty restaurants for free. (normally a fee of $30.00 per person)It also gives you a private butler on the beach...or just someone to take your orders so you don't have to keep going up to the bar/restaraunt.We did not recieve the slippers, robes or beach towels until our last night! There was no Premium Liquor. They only had 2 brand name liquor and 1 brand name beer Corona at any given time and they were sold out by 2 in the afternoon. So we never did have premium liquor. The free entrance to the specialty restaruant was allocated to us at by a date determined by the resort...and in our case fell on the day before we recieved our vouchers...then when we tried to re-book the restaurant was closed to private functions. ( how pathetic). I never saw a server on the beach once and we were on the beach from 8:00 to 4:00 everyday. The cost to the upgrade was $35.00 per person per night. It is a must that both people in room pay the cost. It cost me 285.00 for nothing. I was very disappointed. Also out of the 50 people working at the resort. Only 2 spoke english. No one at any bar or restaurant spoke english at all. We tried every night to order wine...there was a list for those who wanted to pay extra. The first night we ordered...they came back to us after we finisheddinner with a different bottle saying they were out of what we ordered but that this was similar. We order a differnt bottle every night of our 4 night stay and ended up getting the same stand in bottle as apparently they don't really have a wine list...just a facade.Other than the fact the beach was very nice and water was great. It was a poor excuse for a resort. I would never go back. There were less than desireable people occupying the resort which I'm not at liberty to describe due to content control of this website. In my opinion they don't deserve a tourist industry.

<Content>HAD A GREAT TIME! We were in DR from 11 APR - 18 APR. We had a wonderful time! I've never seen hotel staff that worked as hard as they did. Please people, if you plan on going, remember that even though this is all-inclusive, please tip the staff. This is a very poor country, and we learned that most of the workers are working 12-14 hour days, and only get paid $50 a week. The tips go a LONG way towards helping them with their bills and families. With that being said, the beach was beautiful, the rooms were clean, the grounds were immaculate. We had a great time. My hubby had a fun time talking to all the foreigners that were there. The food was good too... the best restaurant we ate at was the Chopin. They have a boat/barge that floats out with a pianist to play for you while you dine. It was an upscale buffet.... how many lobster tails did I want? Oh baby! More wine? Yes please! We went para-sailing.... worth every penny! We also went snorkeling, but the guy who took us out in the boat didn't have a ladder, so I had a heck of a time getting back into the boat! Some kind party boat let me up on their ladder so I could get back into my boat. That was a little tricky. But definately try the para-sailing. We would definately go again. Ruben, the bartender at the swim up bar, was very charming and attentive. We had a great time. You won't get drunk there... (I can see why the booze is watered down, you wouldn't want a resort filled with drunk idiots)... so if you want a buzz, drink the wine, or try a woo-woo.... vodka, grenadine, and peach snapps, two of those and you'll know why they call it woo woo! We're going to bring our own bottle next time we go somewhere.... enjoy your time in Dominican Republic!!!!! Thanks Princess Bavaro!!!! OLA!

<Content>The stay was OK, but would not recommend to anyone to go there We have just returned from a week at the Bavaro Princess All Suites. The hotel is average and we have experienced very por level of service. We stayed in bungalow #34, which was very close to the beach and the pool. To get to the Main Buffet we had to either walk about 15 mins or take a train they have running every 5 mins or so.We stayed on a 1st floor and I could feel a musty smell all 7 days. The rooms are quite old and especially bathroom was in a poor condition, crying for a renovation.The pool is lovely. The towel distribution guys (from animation team) were rude. They ran out of towels several times per our stay. The working hours of towels' service (9 AM - 6PM) do not correspond to the hours available for swimming at sea or the pool (7 am - 7 PM). The waitress or waiters showed up only 2 or 3 times at the pool area during our 7 days stay, and without taking orders but for distributing remaining drinks they had with them.The shade lounges on a beach are occupied / reserved before 7:15 AM and we WERE NOT able to get a spot in the shade on a beach. Our friends got lounges for us near the pool instead.Restaurants are waste of time - we tried Chopin (so-so) and a Stake House - really bad. While the food is not very good, the service is horrible - they forget what orders they take, what drinks we ask, etc. This is applicable to the whole resort - they can't handle orders properly and usually (in 50%) you would not get what you asked for. On our day #2 we ordered 4 Cokes for kids and waited for them over 40 minutes and reminded at least twice until I went to the buffet manager and he took this under his own control. He tried to do something to impress us and not to carry the incident in a memory and arranged our special table reservation for 12 people every evening in the buffet. Nothing more than that, but a t least a try.Overall I would say this is probably the worst hotel we have ever stayed in D.R. and Mexico. The best part of this travel was the beach and the weather - excellent 7 days. It looks like we would have to stick with better chains, such as Iberostar, to get a better service.

<Content>Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort We were at the Bavaro Princess from April 17-24th. The resort was absolutely amazing. It was extremely clean, well kept, excellent service in all the restaurants, lobby, guest services, housekeeping etc. One day the maids ran out of towels as our suite was one of the last to be done... I called and requested towels, coffee, and a light bulb for a lamp that had just blown. 10 min later a man with a tool box was there to repair the lamp (which only needed a light bulb).. the towels arrived 20 min later. And then customer service called and asked if my requests were fullfilled. The room was a suite, much like an apt. with the best air conditioning I have ever seen.Beach towels were hard to get. You have to get there early and those that line the palapas and lounges with their towels at 4am are annoying but that is not the resorts fault.The pools were off limits after 7pm due to chemical treatments I would have prefered them open longer but it didnt' really matter.Walking on the beach we found alot of garbage at nite but by morning not one item could be found. The walk ways are swept daily with clorine. The food was ok.. different themes at the buffet every nite.. it was different. Not the best but not the worst...To me it was a fabulous resort.My only complaints with the entire trip ...... One nite my husband in his own stupidity went off resort with a group of guys... who he later lost.. ended up getting taken further and further away from the resort by people who were taxi-ing him back to resort.. got chased, and eventually found a police officer who gladly took him back to the resort but not before stopping at the ATM to pay him for his service. The sharks during the day across from the resort are extremely annoying and I had to tell one that if he grabbed my arm again to come into his shop he'd find out what Canadian women were all about.. he left me alone.We bought 3 bottles of rum as gifts, .. I checked and rechecked them several times when purchasing and then again before putting them in the suit cases... they were sealed. When we arrived in Toronto my suit case was soaked from the rain (as it was on a trolly in a storm at the airport outside) .. both of the locks were cut off our suit cases.. and one of the bottles of rum were opened and a cigar butt deposited inside.. and then the netting that was on the bottle was replaced to look as if it were untouched. We also visited the Paradisus as my neice was there on her honey moon.. it was also a nice resort.. lots of loungers available etc. compared to the Bavaro Princess. And their Palapas are bigger for more shading. They also have beds on the beach instead of just loungers.The ocean was very wavey which is great for us... My neice was married at Melia, had her honeymoon at Paradisus. My sister was still at Melia and told me that the ocean is very calm there compared to where we are.. hardly any waves.I found the Country itself to be extremely dirty with the garbage etc.. the roads are half completed etc... (however, keep in mind it's an entirely different world)....... The resort however was Fabulous.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation! I have been reading reviews on Bavaro Princess for about 6 months. I was very nervous to book our vacation as a lot of reviews were not very good. I took advice from a friend who had went one year ago, she said the resort was excellent and said we would love it. My husband and I stayed at Bavaro from April 16-23rd, we flew Sunwing. Our flight was the only problem we had all week as it was delayed about 8 hours leaving due to mechanical problems. We had a 2 hour bus ride from La Romano airport to our resort so it did make for a long day. We did go w/ the Platinum upgrade. I would def reccommend getting the upgrade as it does give you unlimited internet/premium drinks and more restaurants. We went to 5 differenet restaurants and only ate at the buffet once at night. The food was very good. Some resatuarants are better then others but the staff go above and beyond to make you feel pampered. Our favorite restaurant was at Bella Pasta, or El Gaucho. The beach was UNBELIEVABLE...beautiful white sand and water that was very clear. The beach bar was great and had wonderful fries that we would munch on through out the day. The rooms at first glance are a little dated but when it came time to leave at the end of the week it felt like home! The rooms were very clean and the cleaning staff always had them done everyday when we arrived back from the beach. This was such a wonderful resort for my husband and I to spend a relaxing week at. I hope someday we will be able to return. I have never seen staff work so hard as at Bavaro and always keep a smile on their faces... they were amazing.

<Content>Amazing No Need to Say More We went to the Bavaro Princess the week of April 10/08. I took my two boys and my mom...we had an amazing time at the resort.when we arrived we were greated with cool towels and a fruity beverage. when we got there they gave us the wrong hotel key our room so we had a small incident. The hotel mamager was very accomadating and said that he would move us to a suite within the next few days. Our rooms were clean and very nice. A little musty but your in a hot country...what do u expected!!!The a la carte restaurants are phenominal!! especially the japanesse teppanyaki restuarant..we ate there twice..the buffet was also suprisingly good...I mean your in a different country so what do you expected, not everything will be north americanized!!!the beaches are beautiful...very breath taking. everyone keeps complaining about the prices of things in the shops like snacks ie chips and chocolate, but can't forget that the bags of lays/doritos or kitkat are all IMPORTED from the states, so they need to make money...and it's not just at this resort, I have been to the domincan 3x this year and it's that way everywhere you go!! The resort is beautiful, the people are very friendly, and always cleaning!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED....I FELT VERY SAFE ON THE RESORT WITH MY KIDS, NO COMPLAINTS!!!LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED ITI WILL BE BACK NEXT YEAR.All those complainers out there should stop travelling to different countries!!

<Content>Just Got Back Hello my wife and i just got back from punta cana DR . We Stayed @ the Bavaro Princess for 5 nights.We went there with an open mind we did check some reviews out some were factual and some to all truthful. I must tell you all we do travel alot so we do have lot of experenices in the caribbean. Well i must tell you for most of us the first day is a wash our case it was 3am-3pm avery long day.When we arrived @ the airport in Punta Cana the wait just was unbelieveable we sat for 2hs in a hot bus just waiting and waiting for what we will never told . Upon getting to the hotel the front desk personnel advised us that are rooms would be in the 900 section in which we requested to be closer to the beach,which was granted. When we got to are room there was a very bad musty smell so i called the front desk and was told we would have to wait until sat @ 3pm to see if there was a room available that was 3 days away.,all i wanted to know if this was this normal or was it just our room i couldnt get a straight answer from anyone. so i ask the maintenance man if he could spray the room and clean it the next morning in which he did so we opt to stay there we justed wanted to try to enjoy our vaction.The next day we walked around the resort and i must tell you the ground were beautiful peacocks,flamingos rooster and all other types of nince looking birds runnig all around. We made it to the beach and it was everything that we were told just BEAUTIFUL BEACH its proabally the nice one i have ever seen very clean plenty white sand and alot of shade. The food i must tell was a mixed bag some good some not so good i think the food prep had alot to do with the taste just okay all in all.I will tell you a couple of helpful tips bring a watch and alot of one dollar billsand DONT TRAVEL OUTSIDE THE RESORT unless you are going home its not safe outside the front gate i will leave it at that. The rooms are dated but clean they are however HUGE and the room service is great the people work very hard to make your stay enjoyable communication is not a problem but i must tell you english is in the minority there but it is very interesting at that. I must be honest we will not return to DR its just not worth the valve of your hard earn dollar so in closing pls email me i would be happy to respone to you thanks......................

<Content>Absolutely the best!! Absolutely the BEST resort we've ever stayed at. The staff was very helpful from the second we got off the shuttle to the moment we got back on to leave. Everyone knew sufficient English to effectively help their guests.The food was out of this world. We ate at the buffet in the main lobby almost every night, with the exception of eating at El Gaucho one night and the Italian restaurant another. Booking was very easy. We didn't get sick once on the entire trip even though we ate everything in sight. My personal experience is that people who have everything to complain about will generally throw in some sickness with the vacation as I have never heard anyone who had a positive experience get sick.The room was amazing. Large bed, cute sitting area, large doors that were nice to open up and let the tropical breeze blow through the room. The rooms are all surrounded by gorgeous tropical vegetation which provides an extremely calming experience. Our room happened to be the furthest from the beach and it absolutely did not take, as previously mentioned, 10-15 minutes to get to the beach. We walked there in about 5 minutes flat each day, even less time if we did take the shuttle. We personally enjoyed walking as the resort offered so much to see that you could really take it all in with a nice walk. We came across a mini nature reserve of sorts in the middle of the resort one day which turned out to be a great surprise.The beach was pristine. Not too crowded and nice and quiet. We didn't have to deal with obnoxious drunken Spring-Breakers or screaming children. Enough chairs down by the beach for everyone.The casino was a great time and not overcrowded at all!! People always available to bring you drinks.Overall, I would rate this resort 6 out of 5 stars - our experience was THAT great. I would recommend this resort to anyone!!

<Content>Great First Experience I'm a little late writing this review. I had an excellent experience at this resort. The staff was extremely friendly and went out of their way to make us feel at home. I highly recommend attending the orientation if you booked through Apple Vacations. At the orientation you learn about the different excursions and activities and you can also make reservations. I definitely recommend the Outback Safari excursion and do the whole day safari not half day. I thought the rooms were nice and the bathrooms were big enough (was sharing with 2 other people, a girls getaway). The only thing I found frustrating was trying to get a palapa. People normally just set the towels on the chairs underneath and would never be there. We found better seating at the pool. However, the beach was beautiful!!! The food was better than I thought it would be based off previous reviews. I think people forget they are in a different country from their country and need to just relax and enjoy what is being offered to you.

<Content>Do Not Stay Here!!!! Warning!!! Save Your Money!!! Hey all...I booked this trip through a travel agent who swore up and down it was a Great place!! It was not. I won't beat around the bush. If you want the truth here it is:1. The rooms were musty and smelled!!! We have had to wash our clothes SEVERAL times since we got back to get the smell out.2. The food was OK. By no means gourmet. The Hispanola buffet was GARBAGE!!! McDonalds would have been better food.3. The employees, including the concierge, did not speak English. I understand this is a foreign country, but I feel there should have been people on duty at all times that were multi-lingual in case of an emergency. There were tourists from all over the world, and I listened to them struggling to communicate. . I was very worried having my wife and three daughters with me that if something bad was to have happened, we would be in BIG trouble.4. We went outside the front gate to shop for trinkets. The hotel prices were highway robbery. ($9.00 for a tiny tube of anti-biotic cream for a cut. The 24 hour Doctor on the premises wanted to charge me $40.00 US for a perscription for the same cream.) At the local shops the vendors were high pressure, which you expect, but when you wouldn't pay the outrageous prices, they yelled at you and said things like You are rich, we are poor....you should give us money! I was shocked.5. My wife found a small snake in the bath tub. It took off down the drain when I tried to get it.6. You have to pay for the Platinum Club ($30.00 a day per person, even kids!!) for top shelf liquor. The bottom shelf liquor was garbage, and the drinks were made in 8 oz. plastic cups.7. The beach was nice, however, there were people walking up and down trying to sell excursions. I just wanted to lay in the sun and relax, not deal with salesmen all day.Bottom line.....DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!AJR

<Content>We Hated To Leave This Beautiful Resort I see from other reviews that people have low tolerances for anything. My husband and I, my sister, my sister-in-law and her husband spent 6 days and 5 nights at this resort. It was the most wonderful vacation we have ever been on. We all opted for the Platinum Package which is definitely worth the few extra bucks. With this package you check in at the Platninum Club and have exclusive use of their lounge which offers drinks and food throughout the day. We also had whiskey, vodka and rum in our room and our fridge was never empty. We had room service 24/7. Every restaurant we ate in was wonderful. Licey's was included in our package and it was incredible. The food was great and the servers were attentive. You get what you give at any resort. If you are cranky and crabby and a complainer, then you certainly aren't going to enjoy yourself. Was everything perfect? No, there were a few kinks but I guess we are all more tolerable than some of you who have written a review.None of our party got sick and we ate a little of everything that was offered. Since the resort caters to many nationalities, it was fun and interesting to try dishes we don't see in the U.S. Food was always available and we enjoyed the El Gaucho.The beach is the most beautiful we have ever seen. We spent most of our time at the pool and the bar staff were entertaining. Franklin was so much fun and we thank him for making our stay there even more enjoyable. Mamajuanas for everyone!Yes, the room smelled a little musty but remember where you are. The humidity is high. We carry air freshener with us wherever we go and it takes care of any unpleasant odors. Our room was clean and the A/C worked fine if you turned it way down. We had a beautiful view of the grounds and had a 5 minute walk to the beach. For those of you who complained about having to take the shuttle here and there - get over it. The resort is 92 acres and you are not always going to be close to everything but that is what makes it so private. You never feel cramped or crowded. The grounds are impeccably kept and it's like a little paradise.Would I go here again? You bet. None of us wanted to leave this beautiful place. Wish we would have booked a longer trip.

<Content>I do NOT recomend My husband and I spent 10 days at this hotel, and we were terribly disappointed.First of all, our room was so far away from the beach that we had to take a mini-bus to take us there, and it took 10/15 minutes. You had to think very well before leaving the room, and check if you had everything You need, cause it was a hell of a ride to get you back. Our room was old and it smelled old. The AC was very noisy and it didnt refresh the room, except in full power(=full noise). There was a leak in the AC, and kept raining the entire week. When we were brushing our teeth, the water fell from the roof right in our necks. This has never been repaired, in spite the cleaning lady put towels to abosrb the water.We had absolutely NO VIEW in our room! We had a wall of vegetation, that kept the light to enter the room!One night we found a cocroach in the bathroom.Personally I found the employees rather careless and a bit arrogant. They were only nice to You if they saw a dollar bill in your hand. The food in the main restaurant was all rigt, but the fish restaurant was terrible. It smelled bad and old. The lobster was terrible, the butter sauce was not good, and the wine was the worst I have ever drank.Though we were extremely carefull not to drink water, ice, and raw vegetables, we were both sick for 2 days and it was horrible. Be very carefull with the food and take meds for this..I will not recommend this hotel to anyone. I dont know why this is a 5 star hotel... I have been to 5 star hotels everywere around the world and none of them were like this. In fact, I stayed in a 4 star hotel in Cuba that was better than this one!!The only thing I really liked was the beach.....

<Content>Avoid this poorly run complex We spent a week at the Bavaro Princess in April. Let me first start with the positive. The beach is beautiful. Drinks are readily available all day and night. The grounds are well kept and very attractive. The rooms are a good size. Unfortunately, with all the naturally positive attributes this resort enjoys simply by its location, the overall experience was marred by lousy service, poor management and the constant noise of the service trucks and trolleys that share the same path you use to navigate this enormous resort.It's not that you can't have a good time there - if you don't mind lots of noise, larges crowds, lining up for food, and herding into trolleys to get to and from your room to the beach. If you are the sort that can over look all that and just enjoy the incredibly beautiful beach regardless how crowded it is, then you may enjoy this place.The pool was beyond disgusting. At night, while the water was still, you could see all the un-skimmed biologicals floating on the surface and you could not see the bottom through the cloud of filth. To be fair, they did treat the pool later in the week which elevated it from disgusting to dirty.The service was awful everywhere except the bars. The bartenders were always friendly and upbeat. If you pay for a Platinum room, don't except to actually get one. They consider any room that is near the platinum area to be platinum. The rooms themselves are no different, they are just closer to the beach then most and closer to the platinum lounge.Overall, since there are so many places in the Caribbean that try so much harder, we will never return to this mammoth complex.

<Content>Wonderful Holiday - Will Return I travelled to the Bavaro Princess with a group of 25 people for my brothers wedding, I am the travel agent who actually booked everybody. This resort is located right in the town of Higuey. We were met at the airport by our Sunwing Rep who then showed us which bus to board to get us to the resort! Upon arrival we were very impressed with the beautiful lobby. Check in staff was very helpful and efficient, everybody spoke pretty good english which isn't a big deal to me, mostly because I'm in a foreign country and not everyone speak english. We had booked ourselves into the lead in hotel rooms. It is well worth upgrading yourselves to the suites, the hotel rooms are a little outdated and quite far from the beach and pool areas, but close to the main restaurant and lobby. We upgraded to suite 095 which was nice and close to the pool,beach and restaurants located at the beach. Either way if your near the beach your far from the main building and vice versa. The food was excellent, there is always lots to choose from, if you like a la carte dining this resort has lots of dining options from a steak house,japanese,pasta,seafood. Everyday you are able to make reservations so get up early to get your prefered time for dining. Each night the main restaurant was themed so one night is italian next could be chinese. Service can be a bit slow at times, while we were there the hotel was at full capacity so thats expected when you have that many people eating at once.The Beach is beautiful just as you picture it to be blue as the sky water and white powdery sand, the palapa's are usually snatched up in the wee hours of the morning, but there are lots of beach loungers otherwise. The beach is breezy and sometimes the water was a bit rough, least to say young kids could easily be taken out. Everyday people are trying to sell you parasailing and jet skiing, beware because we booked to go parasailing for 1:30pm and didnt actually go until 4:00 so we wasted a whole afternoon waiting around for them! but thats not the hotels fault by any means. I also wouldn't recommend the ATV trip but the buggy's instead, it was 160.00 for me and my boyfriend to go and we didn't see anything of interest and we stopped every five minutes!The grounds are kept imaculate and everybody working there makes an extra effort to say Ola when you walk by, very friendly and helpful! There are two pools the main one is right off the beach where you can find a swim up bar and activities, if you like it a little quieter then the pool up by the main lobby is better, there is bar there as well but not swim up! mostly young families were there when I was there. All and All every vacation is what you make it, I travelled with good company and understand that not all standards are going to be what they are in Canada. take mosquito repellent for at night just as you would use at home, and upgrade to a suite, bigger rooms, nicer bathroom and better location. Goodluck and Happy Travels

<Content>Mixed review I also was a little worried about going here after reading some of the reviews. We were there from March 30th to April 6th. This is our 3rd trip to Dominican Republic. We loved the resort. It was beautiful, clean, picturesque. Very large.The trolley cars are a great idea though we walked most of the time. Everything is within about a 10 minute walk. Our weather was not the greatest but even bad weather there is better than winter in NH. It did rain one day and a small storm every day that passed over after about 15 minutes. The beach is absolutely the best. We didn't go in the pool but it was very clean and quite lovely. There are more than enough lounge chairs for everyone and plenty of shade to be had both at the beach and at the pool area. I did not see any bugs. Our check in was a nightmare and we thought we had made a major mistake in coming here. We were a group of 4 couples, one couple honeymooners who had requested a king size bed. They and one other couple were given twin beds but that was finally taken care after a few hours. We were not given beach towel cards and by the time we finally did get them, the towels were all gone. We arrived about 2:30 and we had about 10 minutes to find the food and eat before it was closed down. Things improved 100% the next day after a great night's sleep on a very comfortable, firm, mattress. Very quiet. Very nice. We did end up enjoying our stay but I have to agree with the folks who were NOT impressed with the food or the service. You will never go hungry here as there is always something to eat. Even if it's salad, fruit and rolls. They don't cook beef well at all. We did not find many of the restaurants that great either. The Italian was very good, we couldn't even find anything to eat from the seafood restaurant menu, though that could be because living in New England, we have the best seafood in the world. We also did not find the service to be even acceptable a lot of the time. It took 3 servers every morning just to get a cup of tea. One to bring the cup. the next to bring the hot water and then another to get a teabag. Very frustrating. There were a couple of waitresses who were pleasant but we found many of the servers to be unfriendly. The language barrier was also a problem but not their fault. The bartenders and maids were exceptions. The maid who did our room was fantastic. She would make swans out of the towels and decorate the room with hibiscus blossoms every day.. very hard working and pleasant person. I do have to say that ALL the servers and staff are extremely hard working people though their pace is definitely not like ours. We have been to many resorts so knew what to expect from a good resort. I'm not sure how to rate this place. If food is not a priority for you and you don't mind very slow, sometime lousy, service but want to visit a well kept, beautiful place, then this is the place to go. Everything else about it was great. I don't think we would go back because there are many other resorts on Punta Cana. We did have a good time. The honeymooners said they would return in a heartbeat, the rest of us probably would not. Bring plenty of dollars for tips. They don't act as though they expect it but they do appreciate it.

<Content>Dancing Under the Stars We are members of a travel club, and our home resort is the Bavaro Princess. Of course we read most of the reviews, and are always interested in what others have to say about this resort. Through the years, for some reason it has remained our favorite. We know that Bavaro Princess is not as new as some of the admitedly gorgeous places that have been recently built in the Bavaro area of Punta Cana. Still, here goes:When we are at Bavaro Princess we feel that we really are on vacation. Our Spanish is not that good, but the staff - from check-in to the restaurants and bars to the animacion staff to the house band - all contribute to making our stay there a lot of fun. They are always - at least to us - gracious, and go out of their way to make service a pleasure. When we read that some people say that the staff is partial to Spanish speaking people, we do not feel that is accurate. Just slow down and little, and speak softly - they will get it. I think most of them do a remarkable job hadling all the languages and trying to make sense of it all! Usually, the managers (bars, restaurants, reservations) will have a fair command of English if you really need to speak to someone. At the night Lobby Bar, and night stage bar, Richard, Dulce and Nelsa are great bartenders and will make you feel at home!The thing we enjoy most at Bavaro Princess is the house band. We have heard some people say there is no dancing there. Here's the deal. If you go up to the lobby area about 8:30 PM, the house band plays most nights in the courtyard near the buffett restaurant Hispagnola. During this time they play mostly jazz cover music (standards). At about 10PM the animacion show begins. We were a little disappointed in the shows this past visit; but the dancers do their best and the shows were OK. Often they are audience participation type or lip-synch dance shows. As soon as the show is over, near 11PM the house band starts again. They play a great mix of merengue, salsa, tango and other latino styles. They seem to get better every year. We do not dance well to this music, but ample whiskey and Banana Mamas do wonders to one's co-ordination! Soon anyone who wants to dance is dancing under the stars in a beautiful open courtyard to a great band. The animacion staff dancers will also drag you out on the dance floor (if you want) and dance with you if your wife or partner is a little shy. We were at a place last year, and their idea of a band was a keyboard player and saxophonist playing cover Beatle music from the 60's. The place was empty. Most of the places think that American cover music is what people want to hear. I am soooooo grateful that Bavaro Princess plays native music. Why would I fly all those miles to listen to an American lounge act? Boring!!!! So if you are open to this type of stuff, don't miss the band. The musical director (Federico Ortiz)deserves lots of credit for putting together a great collection of singers and musicians. After that, you can listen to a decent latino/americano DJ mix, or stop by the nearby Casino (they provide transportation) for a while. We seldom get up in time for breakfast at Bavaro Princess. Drinking, dancing, gambling, Dominican cigars - I guess we are just too corrupted here!!!Bavaro Princess has a very European and Latin American feel, and it is not uncommon to see several generations (grandpop, dads, and grandkids) still up at midnight. Ditto a very European feel on the beach and pool area, so the scenery can be a little different to what North Americans are used to. I just say Viva la difference. We always have fun there! Just be open to a different experience, and up for a good time!

<Content>Ignore bad reviews! My boyfriend and I (I'm 27, he is 30) stayed at Bavaro Princess from 3/19-3/24. We chose this resort based on the recommendation of a friend before doing any research. We booked, then began to research the resort and found many negative reviews. After reading those reviews we became extremely nervous. I am so glad to say that those reviews could not have been more wrong! We booked Platinum, which I highly recommend. We arrived around noon on our first day and were a little disappointed to learn that check-in was not until 3! We went to the Platinum Lounge for check-in anyway and were pleasantly surprised to find that our room was ready. Juan (the Platinum Lounge attendant) was more than accomodating and got us on our way in about 5 minutes. He also gave us advice on many things throughout our stay.The suite was amazing. Our suite was 783, very close to the beach and main pool. It was HUGE and looked identical to the pictures you see in the reviews. It was very clean and the maid was extremely friendly throughout the week. She always put tropical flowers on our bed after making it! We had no problems with hot water or water pressure throughout our 6 days there. I did not see any insects or mold either. The resort was beautiful, clean, and perfectly maintained. My boyfriend commented that he had been looking for a few days and had not seen one single piece of trash anywhere. Another thing we found fascinating was how hard the people worked. The entertainment staff taught aerobics on the beach in the morning and worked late into the night putting on the evening shows. The shows are not boring like people say on here. No, they are not broadway productions, but they are funny and entertaining. Yes, they were a bit cheesy at times, but we had such an appreciation for how hard these young people worked! The thing that I was most nervous about was the food. My boyfriend can be a tough critic of even fine dining restaurants here in the States, so I was really scared he would hate the food there! He LOVED the food. With the exception of one dinner, he loved everything. He didn't really care for the pork he ordered at Sakura, but thought everything else was excellent. I'm not going to go on about every a la carte restaurant, bc you can read all about them on other reviews. But-our absolute favorite (and we did eat at Licey) was Tanuki. It is a Japanese steakhouse (where they cook the food in front of you) and we actually ended up eating there twice. They serve steak, chicken, shrimp, and salmon after starting out with appetizers of assorted sushi and soups. We did the buffets for breakfast and lunch and a la carte restaurants for dinner. Neither of us even got an upset stomach the entire time we were there and we both ate a little of everything. With our platinum bracelet we got lots of little extras. Free use of internet, free 20 minute massage (excellent), dinner at Licey, free snorkeling, etc. The one thing they don't tell you, and my boyfriend found this to be crucial, was that you can only get bottled beer if you have a platinum bracelet. Otherwise they give it to you from a tap. The only things we paid for were horseback riding on the beach and a manicure (for me) at the spa. The horseback riding was fun, but the horses were very skinny which is why I probably wouldn't do it again. I have been to many islands and lots of different resorts and this was by far one the best. You just have to keep in mind that you are not in America. Be open to new foods and new things and you will love this resort. The workers were very friendly and we found the service to be very quick and very good. We did tip (we spent about $100 in 6 days there) bartenders, our maid, servers, chefs, etc. Remember a dollar or two here or there goes a long way! We definitely didn't want to leave and plan to go back very soon! It is an excellent resort for people of all ages!

<Content>Had a great time at Bavaro Princess My wife and I traveled with two other couples ( all 50s and 60s ) to the Bavaro Princess March 10th. We had an early non-stop flight from O'Hare on USA3000. We were on our way on time and no problems. No problems at our arrival in Punta Cana Airport, not much has changed, purchased our $10 tourist card and we were on our way. We got our luggage, processed thru customs and then We were met by our Apple representative's and escorted to our waiting air conditioned bus. It would have been nice to have a cold beer on the way to The Bavaro Princess but it was only a 1/2 hour trip. BAVARO PRINCESS: At our arrival our rooms were not ready which we kind of expected because we were so early. Our check-in went fairly smooth, for some reason one of the couples wasn't listed, but in a few minutes all was taken car of and We were all assigned rooms next to each other. By that time The Hispaniola (main buffet) was open for lunch so we ate. The food was very good and the service was also. Wit the exception of dishing our own food, it was like eating in a normal restaurant. We finished eating and returned to the lobby, they had one room ready so we had all of our luggage transferred to that room where we all changed into beach wear and went for a look around. After a short time at the beach and pool bar we returned to the room and called the front desk, they had finished with the other two rooms and sent our keys to us and we moved into our own rooms.  THE ROOMS: The rooms were all huge and pretty much the same, Large sitting area couch, chair and table. The mini fridge was stocked with water coke products and beer and cold. Lower rooms had a veranda with couple of comfy lounge chairs and a table, upstairs had similarly furnished balcony. All had an elevated bedrooms, the beds were very firm but we all slept very well and were happy with our rooms. Plenty of hot water and toiletries. There were no bugs of any kind in our rooms that I saw. We asked for and received face cloths. The rooms were kept clean and the fridge stocked never had worry about security, my laptop sat out all week and was never bothered.  WAS everything perfect...No...the light fixture in the bathroom needed to be replaced, the closet doors were hard to move but other than that no complaints. Our room was 14-141 by the way  THE FOOD: The food was very good at all of the restaurants. The new Japanese Restaurant Teppanyaki food and service was the best and most fun we tried. El Pescador Fish and Shellfish was next favorite, enjoyed the lobster. The Argentinian style Steak House El Gaucho was next, everybody but me had the Argentine steak and loved it I had a mixed grill and thought it was great. During the day El Gauho is buffet or breakfast and lunch. The omelets were always good as were the eggs cooked to order. Always plenty of fresh bread and juices. Everyday outside of El Gaucho they served a lunch also each day different. Fajitas one day Shrimp and Pasta one day everyday was good. Also by the El Gaucho by the bar you could get hot dogs, hamburgers and French fries. Hamburgers were not he best but the fries and dogs were very good. THE BEACH: Fantastic, beautiful blue water, miles of soft warm sand. My wife went for long walks sometimes alone and sometimes with friends. I walk with a cane so I just enjoyed bobbing around in the surf, and relaxing on the beach. One couple liked the beach best the other liked the pool so we split our time between them with our friends. Lots of activities to keep people busy volleyball, beach aerobics or tug of war on the beach. The staff worked hard at keeping everyone happy. Which included just leaving you alone when you wanted to rest, read a book catch some sun or some zzz's.  THE POOL: We spent time at the main pool by the beach I can highly recommend it. There are islands in the pool with trees that provided shade if you wanted it and lots loungers with shade. We spent a lot of time with Rafael at the pool bar. He was the best, loved to pass out shots of MamaJuana with a flair. The pool is huge and always clean. They have water aerobics, scuba lessons, kayak races and water volleyball, seems there is always something going on.  Over all the resort was wonderful. The grounds were flush and well kept with lots of exotic birds. The entire staff was helpful, friendly, and honest. What more can you ask for? I don't know where the bad reviews come from, certainly not from what we experienced. Don't waste your time worrying about the bad things some people say. Some people aren't happy unless they make everyone around them miserable. Mosquitoes? A few. Bugs in rooms? None. Weak drinks? None for us. Topless sunbathers? You bet. Bad food? None we tried. Is this place huge? Oh yea. You can walk or ride, it's up to you.Thanks to John and Joan at Travel Discoveries for making it all possible.

<Content>a view from the top My husband and I just arrived home today from Bavaro Princess. After reading the reviews before I left, I went with average expectations. For your info, I am not a big traveller. My husband has travelled around the world with his work. I was worried about the water, food, mosquitos, (I took malaria pills before leaving and while there etc). We had a wonderful time. This resort is gorgeous and beyond. The staff always say, ola first, our mini bar was well stocked and continued to be, little carts and wagons escort clients around frequently. We loved the wildlife, ponds, etc Lots of places to sit and have quiet (or not), gorgeous pools (3 I believe), the beach is just what you'd expect (white sand), some activities (not alot but we were looking for someone to entertain us). Food and restaurants to die for. So GO! Don't listen to the negative....I don't know where these people hail from. I should tell you also that this was a last minute trip = booked on Tues and left Thurs. and it was a 3 day deal = left Thurs from Ottawa to T.O. to Punta Cana and then left late (11:30pm Sun night bringing us back into Ottawa by 9:00 Mon morn. A lovely Easter break - no complaints.... for once!Sandie

<Content>A pleasant surprise! I was really nervous about going to this resort after having read so many negative reviews here on tripadvisor. We were pleasantly surprised and in fact, extremely pleased with our stay from March 11th to the 18th.Check in: Very polite and fast. They had everything ready for us.Rooms: Our first room was in the building attached to the lobby. We had booked a 'junior suite and they are all located in Building 3. We had arrived late at night and we were quite tired so we didn't really take note of the room until the morning. It was quite run down and the bathroom looked terrible (clean but rundown). It was also at the farthest point from the beach and the main pool. The next morning, we asked to be moved to one of the rooms in the little houses spread throughout the property. Initially, they were quoting us the 'book' rate of $12 pp/night. We ended up getting it for $100 (+$10 tip to the front desk guy) and they promptly moved us. The room we got was in one of the house that contains 8 units and was in building 19. It was absolutely perfect! A nice walk to the beach and not far from the lobby either! We were extremely pleased and I would reccommend booking these rooms as they are the 'deluxe junior suites'. Well worth the money! My only complaint would be the size of the pillows (too small) but, that's me. Another person I met thought the pillows were perfect.Pool: Two pools, a smaller one close to the lobby and the main one near the beach. Nothing spectacular but nice pools. I liked the main pool since it was such an odd shape it didn't feel like everyone was lined up around the edge. Beach: Just beautiful!! Large sand area with plenty of space and palm trees!There were plenty of chairs both at the pool and the beach. We never once had to get up at the crack of dawn just to get a chair and no matter what time we went, there were always plenty of loungers available. Food: Plenty of options in terms of a la carte restaurants. These were a nice change from the buffets and the food was good. One must remember that you are in the Dominican and their food is cooked differently so you can't expect that it will be like what we're used to at home. Travelling is about experiencing other cultures and I would go so far to suggest that if you think the food at this resort is bad, then don't travel. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the food and there were plenty of options. The buffet near the beach had a different speciality dish each day and lots of seafood. The buffet near the main lobby was also quite good and had lots of variety. I find it difficult to believe some of the other travellers found the food horrible and not having enough variety. In fact, when we got there and after a day or two, we found it annoying that other tripadvisor reviewers even wrote negative stuff. Almost everyone we talked to that had read the reviews was irritated about the negativity. The food is good, there is lots of variety and there is something for everyone. If you think you have good restaurants in Chicago (as one traveller wrote), then stay home and enjoy them.Staff: All were friendly and they all work hard. We agree that many of them do not speak English but you are in their country so you should be able to speak a little Spanish. Again, I must repeat that if you want clear English, stay home.Entertainment: We travel twice, sometimes 3 times a year and all of these types of resorts have their nightly shows and they are all similar. We didn't watch many of them cause they are all similar in whatever country you visit. They had a nice band that played before the show and the lobby was always buzzing with activity near the bar.Trolley Car: The resorts in Punta Cana are mostly quite large and this one was no different. There is a trolley car that passes frequently enough if you don't want to walk. We found the walks were very calming and pleasant since the resort has many pathways throughout. We used the trolley if it was late at night and we never had to wait more than 5 to 10 minutes.Property: The grounds are impeccable. They are beautiful and lush and 'eco' friendly. Near the lobby, there is a pond with ducks, flamingos, peacocks, chickens, etc and they are all a beautiful addition to the landscape.All in all, we had a great stay and really enjoyed this resort. I would not hesitate to go back and I highly recommend this hotel. We consider ourselves experienced travellers so I know a good resort from a bad one (and I've had BAD ones!). If you're looking to duplicate the food and your home while away, then I suggest you don't travel at all! Travelling is about experiencing new places and new people. I'm all for the little extras while away but, I'm always surprised at what people expect when you go to a town such as Punta Cana (like a very slight musty smell in the room.....hellooooo...you're beside the ocean!) The Bavaro Princess is a beautiful place and there is nothing to worry about.

<Content>Awesome Resort!!! We stayed at Bavaro Princess in Punta Cana March 8-15. There is not one bad thing i could even think of to say about this resort. My husband and i loved it. The staff is amazing! Service with a smile. Everyone is so friendly and they do whatever they can to make you happy. The grounds are beautiful..breathtaking.. It is huge and lush. peacocks, flamingoes, geese, mallards, roosters just walking around, it was great. i was a little worried because i did read some bad reviews, but i do believe that those people who complain, really would complain about anything. ignore the bad reviews. My husband and i went for our honeymoon, we are both 30 and from Minneapolis. The beach is great, the beach boys are hilarious, the drinks are awesome, and strong. i do tip tho. not for everysingle drink, but a dollar here and there so my drinks were strong and great! the Banana Mama is YUM! we drank those and rum and diet all week. The food was good. some things we stayed away from but everything we thought was good. once you learn what to stay away from its easy. we ate all the restaurants except the pasta one. At El Goucho get the sirloin, its great, my husband got the lamb, and it was not good. At the seafood restaurant we both got the surf and turf and that was really good. we ate at Chopin twice once for our honeymoon dinner and they had a great filet with mushroom sauce and another time, it was for AppleVacations and they had a buffet, and that too was great. The breakfasts at both buffets are great. El Goucho is a buffet for breakfast and lunch. The omelettes are great, ate them everyday and the fresh fruit is excellent. We did tip the omelette guy and he stuffed our omelettes full!! Our room was my the beach, building 34, room 343. Never once saw a cock roach and i was expecting too. Saw a little spot of mold but not a big deal.. our room was not musty smelling at all. we loved it. it was so clean. Our view was beautiful. Not an ocean view,but the grounds are just so spectacular. very tropical. I did come home with bug bites, Misquitos are in Punta Cana and you know what? they are in Minneapolis too!! I always get bit alot by misquitoes for some reason no matter where i am, my husband never once got bit!Never had a problem communicating with anyone in the staff. everyone spoke english. Just know how to say some things in spanish, like hi, please, thank you. One thing, no clocks anywhere in the resort, so if you like to know what time it is, bring a watch. We didn't bring a watch and never knew what time it was, always had to ask someone or call the front desk. I did notice that the staff likes to joke around, so have a sence of humor, dont be so uptight and please do not be rude to these people. they work their butts off. Did i mention how clean it was there?? i am a clean freak and i could not complain. Never saw dirt. Like people have said before, some people just like to complain, for those people maybe they should perhaps just stay home because no one would even want to be around them. I HATE people who complain, complain complain... Stay home!!!!We did the zipline excursion as well, what a blast.!! You go into the mountains and you see alot of things you would on the Safari Tour. so if you do the zipline, you dont need to do the Safari Tour. You take the same route, and your tour guide shows you alot. On the way home, we stopped by where Maria makes her coffee and you can buy it for $5. i bought some and its great!Enjoy your stay here. I would recommend this resort to everyone and when we go back to Punta Cana, we will stay at Bavaro Princess!

<Content>Could of been better! WE booked through Apple Vacations because we got such a good deal. We went July of 2007. The resort could of been better if we upgraded. The walk to the beach was soooo far. We were in the furthest building ever soo if we forgot something back at the room forget it!!! that was horrible. We had cold water 4 out of 7 days. Someone complained and we got the hot water again. Being in the sun all day and going to cold shower was not that bad but you want the option. Second, the room was not comfortable. We should of requested a newer model. Third the smell when walking to the beach in one section over by the pumps was horrible!!!! Third the resort was too big. Overall the people were very nice and the food was good. We paid to go to the restaurant that was on the beach our last night and that was sooooo worth it. soooo romantic and the food was awesome!! would we go back maybe but only if we paid for the upgrades..

<Content>Great Time had by all...... My wife and I and another couple ( in our late 30's) were at the Princess from Feb. 23rd to March 2nd. We booked through Apple Vacations. We travel every year to different locations in the Carribean and Mexico. This was our 3rd time in the DR. When deciding which resort to choose we read Trip advisor and were worried from what we read, but the resort had everything we wanted in a resort and wanted to go to a resort we hadn't been to yet. So we booked it. All I have to say is... some people you just can't please. Let me start off with the not so good. Some of the other reviews are factual , but over stated. The rooms on the 1st floor had a musty odor, You are however at a beach resort. When walking to the front of the resort you pass the treatment plant and there is an odor for a few seconds. (for a 7 day trip it maybe a total of 5 mins. of a bad odor to endure) HELLO!!!! you are on a island that is mostly JUNGLE!!!!! there are bugs and mosquitos. We were bit a few times at night but not overbearing.Now the great. The service we found to be excellent. The staff is always there to help with whatever we needed. You will be treated how you treat others. We tipped the maids a few dollars and always got what we asked for. Juan Carlos (JC) at the beach bar always hooked it up. He speaks pretty good english and was always attentive and tried to make it a party atmosphere.We ate at El Pescador, Bella Pasta(twice), the Hibachi place and the Japanese place. Our best expirience was at the Japanese place and Bella pasta, however all places were good. The main dining room had many options for food and you can always find something you like. The grounds are beautiful and well kept. The beach is awesome!!! It dosent hurt that the scenery is enhanced by the Europeans. Overall we had a great expirience at the princess. Is it the best I have been to? No Thats why I gave it 4 instead of a 5. Would I go back to the Princess? Yes. Good advice:1) Tip your maids and bartenders. (you are not required to, my expirience has proved it to be a wise decision)2) If you dont speak spanish learn some simple words and phrases before you go. i.e. hello, goodbye, bathroom, do you speak english..... etc. Its fun and the staff will appreciate it and engage you and remember you.3) Treat people how you want to be treated!!!!!!

<Content>Disgusting The rooms are disgusting, dirty, and infested with mosquitos. I stayed at Dreams for a week (had a FANTASTIC experience there), and on the day we were to leave, our flight was delayed 9 hours, so Sunwing put us up at the Bavaro Princess for one night. The Bavaro Princess is nothing compared to Dreams. The rooms may be a little bigger, but the tub was rusting, the shower curtain had stains on it, there was a leak in the closet. We had no moquitos at Dreams whatsoever, and the Princess had them everywhere, they don't take care of their grounds very well. I didn't get a chance to explore the grounds as we arrived at night. The buffet had no choices and the food was all cold.Stay away from this hotel, book DREAMS instead!!!! Dreams is AMAZING.

<Content>Accurate Review of Bavaro Princess Prior to arriving at the Bavaro Princess, I visited tripadvisor.com and read many of the review. I have never written a review on tripadvisor.com, but after visiting Bavaro Princess Resort I wanted to write a review that more accurately reflects the experience at the resort. My fiance and I had a great time at this resort and we wanted to share this with everyone! We both travel for business and quite a bit for pleasure, so this review is coming from the perspective of two people who travel quite frequently both domestically (U.S.) and internationally. Check in at the resort was quick and efficient. The man who checked us in at the front desk spoke English well and was very friendly. After check-in, were were taken to our room on a trolly. We were very happy with the quality and cleanliness of the room. Yes, there was a bit of a musty smell, but you are in the Caribbean where the weather is humid year around! Everyday, we either sat by the pool or on the beach. Both the beach and the pool are beautiful! The grounds of the entire resort are impeccible. The service at the bars was attentive and the bartenders were very friendly. The bartender at one of the bars even saved two coconuts for our drinks one day. The service at all of the restaurants was wonderful. When you are in a foreign country where English is not the main language, then saying hello and thank you in the local language will go a long way! We never had any problems with the waitstaff being unfriendly in any of the restaurants or at the buffets, but saying hello and thank you in Spanish will make the waitstaff smile and more attentive. The food is not gourmet by any means, but if I wanted gourmet food then I would not go to a less developed country! I can eat gourmet food in the U.S. anytime I want. I came to this resort to relax and enjoy the weather and beach/pool, which we enjoyed completely. People should arrive with more realistic expectations when traveling to any foreign country: The food will not be the same as it is in the U.S. The fruits and vegetables are delicious, so definitely take advantage of this while you are there! Also, the fruit smoothie stand at the breakfast buffet is wonderful! The only complaint I would have about the resort is the people that hassel you for water sports when you are sitting by the pool or on the beach. These people will come up to you everyday to try to sell you things, but by saying no once they do leave you alone the rest of the day. Also, there were no alarm clocks in the room. For all of the complaints that I have read, I think that the price of the resort makes it a good value for your money. When you travel to a less developed country, you cannot expect everything to be just like it is in the U.S. If you want luxury and perfect English, then be willing to pay $1,000 a night at The Plaza in NYC. We had a great time and we will definitely be going back to the Bavaro Princess!

<Content>Enjoyed It We, a couple in our 40s, stayed at Bavaro Princess the last week of February. This is our 4th visit to Punta Cana in 3 years, so we knew what to expect in terms of the beach (which is why we go back) the type of service and the quality of the food you can expect from DR. We always stay at a 5*. Saying this - this resort is on par or similar to other 5* resorts in PC. They each have good and bad.The resort is huge - so if you dont like walking or waiting 5 minutes or so to get the trolly - not for you. It takes about 15 minutes to walk from beach to reception - nice walk though.Rooms - huge is not the word - they are massive!! We did request a top floor room and had no problems with smell, mold, bugs, etc. that some have complained about. Sure, they are not the Ritz, but they are fine. We had no problems with maids, or water or anything else. Left a few dollars each day, smile and said hello if we saw her - left a note for Cervesa - and got it.Service - Overall pretty good - definitely some people with attitudes - but is this not the case any place you are?? I found that tipping did not appear to be happening - which was surprising as usually you do. We tended to tip a little here and there and especially tipped if the service was good. They really do try hard. Some of the staff are amazing and go out of there way to help. Some of the staff dont speak a lot of english, but if you keep the words simple and little bit of hand jesters you get the message through!!Hotel Communication - This was my only real complaint. They told you in their literature or on a sign that a restaurant or bar was open to a specific time - when you arrived it was closed. You spoke to someone one night and they said you did not need reservations for the next night - you arrive and you needed reservations. It was as though they changed the rules as they went along - quite frustrating to say the least. We asked about a courtesy room to change in - they said no problem the day before - the day we left - nope we dont provide those rooms - use the spa showers. Again, frustrating!Night Life - the shows were typical resort shows from 10-11 - nothing to write home about. Sometimes a band from 11-12 and then nothing to do - unless you went to the casino (which has the resorts small disco in it). (Be careful of the people that come into the resort asking you to go the disco - it is not the resort disco - rather one in town.)Overall - a good resort that has everything you need.

<Content>It was not bad Toronto, Ontario.I was at this resort from Feb 21-28th. I went with my 2 girlfriends who are frequent travellers down south and they also said it was a below average resort. For me, I've been to a few places (Cayman island, Cozumel, Bahamas) but I never thought my trip to Punta Cana would be like this. First, I have to say that the beach is FABULOUS! It is the only reason why I rank it a 3 star. The resort has nice landscaping but I think instead of putting attention to the outside land area, there needs to be more work done to the rooms. I do expect that the rooms will have a musky smell but our room (in front of the beach) stunk like heavy mildew and was worse when the AC was on. It blew a stench of mildew into our faces constantly! I was also disappointed with the bathroom. I wanted to wear rubber boots when I was taking a shower. The water did not drain so I was showering in a puddle of dirt and other junk that was back logged from the drain. The bathroom condition was disgusting. As for the food, it was okay. I never touched the fresh fruit or the salads but always had the foods that were hot. My friend ate the green salads and fruits and got a little sick. So I stayed away from that. The main buffet in the lobby area was decent so we ate there frequently. The late night snack buffet is disgusting but there is not anything else to eat because food cooking stops at 10pm. The resort is huge so you have to take a trolley to get around. It's great to use during the day but watch out if you decide to stay out past midnight, there is none to be found. From the front lobby to our room, it was a brisk walk of 15-20 mins!!! Which bring about another point, there are millions of mosquitoes so make sure you go to a travel clinic to get Anti-Malarial medications and bug spray. My friends and I were eaten ALIVE, especially at night when we had to walk back to our room!!!!Most of the staff were friendly but some of them needed to learn some manners. Since we were 3 females, the male workers were sometimes too aggressive and persistent in hanging out with us. Just really annoying because they wouldn't take NO as an answer. We met a gentleman who was there with his wife from Grand Rapids, Michigan who we had to pretend was one of my friends father. He would come over and tell the workers to beat it! It worked because he was a BIG giant and very serious looking. Thank you Richard and Sue!!!The entertainment (nightly theatre) is not that great but there isn't much else to do after dinner. On our first night, we were told to go to the hotel's night club. So we went but the details were a secret. At the front of the lobby, there was this cab/shuttle that picked us up (looked like a hotel shuttle, but isn't) and took us about 10 mins from the hotel. It was Aeraeito (?). So when we got there, we thought it was part of the hotel (all inclusive) so we ordered drinks but then the bartender said that each drink was $7!!! Then another bartender said it was $6/ drink. The first bartender was a complete liar and scammer! The odd thing is, they kept saying that they were part of the Bavaro Princess Hotel but the club was a separate cost. At the end of the night, we left the club thinking that we could take that shuttle back to the lobby, but nope, we had to pay to get back (again many different quotes of prices). So what they should have told us: Bring lots of money because we'll give you a free ride going there but you're on your own after you get out of that shuttle, you have to pay for drinks and ride home. We didn't bring enough money (just enough to tip hotel workers) so we walked home, which was a long, dark and scary walk!!!! Avoid the night club, it's full of weird locals and prostitutes! Overall, the resort was not bad. If you get a good deal (like less than 900 Canadian dollars, without taxes) I would say, give it a try but but don't expect a 5 star. It's more like a 3 star.

<Content>Awesome Honeymoon, remember it is a foreign country! Please don't forget that you are going to a foreign country. I really have nothing but good things to say about the Bavaro Princess. The grounds are beautiful, the whole resort is spotless in regards to any garbage or even bird poo being around, and there are a lot of birds!! (flamingos, peacocks, sparrows, etc) Yes.. as a lot of people have mentioned, the musty smell in the room is there. I was a little disappointed with that, but I also knew from reading reviews that it would be there. Yes.. there are cockroaches, but we were there for seven days and only saw three. It happens, just like household centipedes or ants happen. We had problems with our iron in the room twice (both times smoking and electrical issues). It was taken care of by the maintenance quite quickly. Yes.... there is a bit of mold, but what do you expect when there is 100% humidity most of the time. The air conditioning worked great, we actually had to turn it down! Other than those things which you have to expect... the room was beautiful and well taken care of. The housekeeping staff was thorough and very willing to take care of what you needed. Our room was not near the beach, but it only took less than 5 minutes to find a trolley that would take you there. The view from our room was beautiful . Just the grounds without anything else had much appeal. The food was good, La Hispaniola (main buffet) was interresting. There were a lot of things there that were not familiar but still good. I am not one to go out there and try different things and I did, and found the experience to be delightful. We had a honeymoon package so we did receive 2 restaurants that you have to pay for, free. Licey was the first, excellent prime rib. A little slow on the service, but if you learn anything about the Dominican Republic, they are very laid back. Anyway, you are on vacation/honeymoon, what do you have to hurry for?!?! The second was Cafe Del Mar, beautiful! Dinner on the beach and the best lobster I have ever had!! The service was amazing, they made a point to take a picture of you with your own camera, very romantic! Chopin was very pretty and had a great buffet, very different from La Hispaniola. We went to El Gaucho twice for lunch. It is on the beach, so it is very busy a lot of people trying to get food, some very rude! Again you have to remember that you are in a foreign country with a lot of foreign people who think the rules don't apply! The beach............Ahhhhhhhhhhh! Awesome! Very easy to find a place to sit in the shade! Because of the palm trees there are plenty of places to find shade. The water was cool at first, but did not take long to get used to. I recommend the kayaking (included) very fun! The pictures in the brochures do not do the beach justice. It is more amazing than you could ever imagine. I definitely recommend going through apple vacations, there is a rep everywhere you go!! Manny (our rep at the bavaro) was wonderful and extremely informative. Also, where ever you went there was a rep... at the airport, on the bus to the resort, on the bus from the resort, at the airport again. The punta cana airport can be confusing to say the least and an apple rep is always there to tell you where to go. I did not notice that from other vacation bookers. The airport was my least favorite thing.  Remember to keep an open mind, you are in a foreign country!!! A country which does not have the same values as the Americas, Europe, or Canada, everything is different in the Dominican Republic but, oh so beautiful!! Relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery and the happiness of the Dominican people!Sorry I do not have any photos to share, but all of the wonderful scenery that you have seen on this website is so true!!!

<Content>Go Go vacations-terrible experience Go Go Vacations, Bavaro Princess Hotel, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic  Trip Dates: July 02, 2007 thru July 11, 2007This letter was an official complaint sent to GoGo Vacations and Hotel: for deplorable and unacceptable condition of trip accommodations provided by Go Go Vacations, Bavaro Princess Hotel.We paid for first class accommodations in your hotel and received:1) At our arrival room was not ready.2) When we got the room it had only one bed (all accommodations noted 4 people).3) We did not get room serviced until day 3!4) Hotel smelled like sewer (so strong that it caused head aches and nausea). (later learned there was problems with water lines)5) We got poisoned by hotel food on 6 (six!) occasions.6) On July 7, 8, 9 (that鈥檚 3 days!) we did not have hot water !!!7) Shower in our room had not enough pressure to operate, during our stay.8) We requested remote control for TV on two occasions and did not get it at all.9) We requested safe key and did not get it at all.10) The service at main restaurant (next to lobby) was non-existent: we had to ask for water or drinks for at least 3 times (and there is no self service allowed!!!) and on one occasion had to wait for 45 minutes to get water (in 95degree weather!!! with kids at the table), plates where cleaned up very sporadically and it was very obvious that priority was given to Spanish-speaking guests over English-speaking gests all the time!!! On numerous occasions there was not enough forks and teaspoons during lunch hours11) The Auto-train running on premises had no room for guests about 20% of the time and except for one had no room for strollers, making it effective waiting time close to 20-30 minutes.12) On departure from hotel Puerto Tours bus was scheduled to pick us up to the airport at 8:30 AM and after multiple calls finally arrived to the hotel at 9:25AM causing us quite a fear of missing the plane (flight scheduled at 11:25 and route to hotel about 30 minutes), by the time we entered airport our plane was finishing boarding.We requested full refund and after 2 month of arguments we were refunded 2 days' cost, and offered $100 credit by GoGo if booked thru themPlease note there are so many great hotels in Punta Cana, this one should be avoided at any costs (it took us 3 weeks just to recuperate and endless comunications with GoGo to get this resolved, to their satisfaction)

<Content>Keep all valuables in your safe Just returned from our honeymoon. 14 days in a honeymoon suite. The hotel, the beach, and the grounds are wonderful. Staff working in restaurants and bars are very nice, but as far as management and staff working in gift shops -- how rude can they be. As soon as you mention you're having a problem, suddenly they don't speak nor understand a word of English. Don't try to get $1 bills, they'll send you to hell just for asking, not thinking you need them for tips. The first 4 days we always had to go back to the Guest Service desk and ask for bath towels (they would only leave 2 towels), or facecloths (manager said they were for Platinum suites only ???) or coffee, or water bottles, and even toilet paper. On the fifth day we took an one day excursion. We returned to a our room to find out that the maid had put the cap in the sink and left the water running. We had water up to our ankles. To me that was harrassment for complaining about the maid service. That night we found out that half of my husband prescribed drugs had been stolen. Jaccuzi didn't work, and was left covered in soap for 45 minutes because shower water just stopped. LOCK EVERYTHING IN THE SAFE. Never again will we return to Dominican Republic. We'll spend our money where people are nice and friendly.

<Content>Not all what I expected 12 family members decided to book a trip to where they thought was going to be heaven..so they heard..WRONG!!First of all the rooms are pretty old and run down...brush up on your spanish b/c no one speaks english very well. We had asked for all families be kept in the same areas, well needless to say everyone was scattered and the hotel isn't exactly small.To get to the beach and to the lobby you have to take a mini bus to and from all day long.. and with a stroller and children not very easy... and they come once every 10 minites and most of the time they're full..especially at peak hours. Not vey much for kids..well not a very nice playground compared to the other resorts. The food was alright, nothing to write home about! Not very much to do at night besides watching a show that starts at 10:00 at night...try watching that late show with a 20 month old..way toooo late!!The only good point would be the beach...simply beautiful, white sand and crystal waters!! But the whole Dominican has that!!I wouldn't go back to this hotel, there was nothing attractive about it!!!

<Content>Pretty good, not a 5 star though Our family of 4- kids aged 10 and 6 were at the Bavaro Princess from Feb. 14-21. The resort was 100% full and you could tell at the buffets and pool area. We did not get the platinum upgrade because it was $30 per day per person, which I did not see worth it.The bavaro princess was a nice resort, beautiful grounds, birds, ponds, and the most beautiful big beach we have been to. The ocean here was great for the kids to play in, not too rough but still some waves for fun. The food was pretty good, buffets were good, but not a huge variety. Kids ate fries alot. There were 2 buffets one at the lobby and one by the beach. The beach buffet was open for breakfast and lunch and is quite small. It gets very busy at lunch so we went to the lobby a couple times as there were no tables. They have a pasta station for lunch and dinner everyday, and also will cook pork chops, hamburgers, hot dogs. We ate at all the a la carte restaurants except the asain. I would recommend booking these, cause the buffet is pretty boring 3 times a day. We enjoyed each of the restaurants. You have to book the a la cartes. You can only book 2 days ahead, which meant you have to go to the lobby every morning to reserve. I was dissapointed that there was not more at the beach McPrincess beach snack place-only burgers, hot dogs and fries. There was nothing in between meals besides this and after supper, there were no snacks at all. We really like the beer here, except the one in the mini fridge. El Presidente is a very good beer. Premium club people got MGD in bottles. The rest of the drinks for the common folk were poor. Bottom shelf liquor, no canadian rye unless you were premium. Pina Colodas and other slushy drinks came out of a slushy machine and I did not care for them. Rooms were good. They supplied us with 2 cots for the kids which was nice. The room has a king bed up top and a living area on the bottom. Very large rooms and a nice sitting area to play cards. Also a patio outside was nice. There is a lot of walking here as it is a large resort. We did not mind as it was so beautiful with large trees and flowers. There is also a train that comes around if you get lazy. Kids club is pretty good, not too many kids go. Mine went a couple times. They played tennis, water polo, some archery, and then played at the kids center. There was also a show one evening that the kids participated in, which was fun. About 10 kids on average at the club. It runs from 10 am to 12:30 and then from 3pm to 5pm. One note, we tried to get money out of a atm machine and it did not work! We have a td card, so make sure you have a backup. Some of the tours do not take credit cards. Lots of Europeans here, which means there is a lot of topless women. If you will be uncomfortable with that, I would advise to pick a differnt spot. It seems that this is common in Punta Cana as they would even walk down the beach topless. My husband didn't mind, but it did make it a little awkward with small kids. We travelled with Air Canada Vacations and as I always say, I will not go anywhere with them again. We had a 7 hour flight from Edmonton and the plane had the old style tv screens. My kids could not see the movies. Some of the headsets didn't work and all they gave for food was a dried up sub and one chocolate bar. Very poor service and unfriendly stewards. All in all we had a great time and didn't let any small things bother us. Just be aware that you cannot compare 5 stars to other 5 stars. If I were to rate out of 10, I would give this a 6. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.

<Author>amandaL1969
<Content>My entire family was sick at the Bavaro! I want to be very fair writing this review, so I want to start with a few points, and the positives:1. The beach was one of the most beautiful that I have ever experienced in my life, and I have traveled extensively2. The bartenders at the pool bar were totally fun, amazing and friendly...especially Julio!3. Rooms were clean and spacious, though not luxurios or modernI have to conclude by saying that I would NEVER go back to the Bavaro for the following reasons:1. The place is too big, and too impersonal. The staff is nice enough, not rude, but certainly do not go out of the way to make anyone feel special or pampered.2, The reservation system is a disaster! You have to get up early every morning to get a decent reservation. Certain people (I hate to stereotype, but it always seemed to be the French-Canadians), tried to cut in line and did not believe that they should be inconvenienced like everyone else. You are on vacation, and are supposed to be able to relax, but, you cannot, if you want to get into a decent resturant.3. The food is awful, and that is true of the buffet and resturants! The buffets are so sub-par, but there is some type of selection for everyone. The resturants, and that includes all, were gross! The Japanese place was loaded with msg, AND EVERYTHING TASTED THE SAME. The Italian was gross, and made Olive Garden look like a 5 star. The fish grill was the worst of all. Tasteless, favorless and soggy! I know I am from New York, and can be a bit of a food snob, but how anyone can say that these places are good, or even average, is so beyond comprehension! 4. To add insult to injury, besides the food tasting awful, it also made everyone violently ill. We are a family of four. My husband and I are in our 30's, and my kids are 8 amd 9. We have traveled extensively, all over the world, and NEVER did we get as sick as we did, here. My 9 year old son was violently ill by the second day. My husband, by the third day. I was ill by the 5th day. I thought my youngest daughter, who is a juvenile diabetic, had escaped, but by the time we got to the airport to fly home, she was vomiting and had diareah. It took us three days back in New York for her to get back to normal. As a juvenile diabetic, this was not an ideal situation for her.So to sum it up, if you only care about an inexpensive price, and an amazing beach, you may actually like this place. But if good food and service are important, stay very, very far away from here. Be prepared for illness, as I have a feeling that the water is the cause. While Punta Cana was, indeed, one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever experienced, I will not go back until the quality and service can be much improved!

<Content>Do your homework before you book at the Bavaro Princess If you don鈥檛 care about cockroaches, mosquitoes, and floods in your suite, then the Bavaro Princes is your destination. If you don鈥檛 care about customer service and fighting your way to get something to eat or find a spot around the swimming pool, then the Bavaro Princes is your destination.I belive long time ago this resort used to be 5 stars, but through time, they lost at least 1.5 to 2 starts. I strongly believe this resort should be rated at 3.5 stars.On a positive note, the beach was fantastic and the food was okay鈥?/p>

<Content>It's ok, not a 5 star. Stayed in a Junior suite of which was booked with Sunwing. The rooms was big, but the locations of Jr. Suite are next to the front lobby in a hotel of 2 floors., it's not the same has a suite. For what we payed it was not one of the best I have ever stayed at. The food was ok, not a 5 star. The entertainment was terrible need a big improvement.The Beach was the best I have been to in D.R. We travel 2 trips in the winter, been to Cuba 4 times, D.R. Puerto Plata twice and Punta Cana was are second time. For $3600.00 Cdn per couple was too much money. The service was good. The grounds are very clean and big, lots of walking to do. But the trolley is a must at this resort. Would I go back there? No. If you go, make sure you book a Suite not a Jr. Suite. Sunwing flight was delayed 4 hours in Ottawa of which we where not impress.But overall this hotel is ok.

<Content>beautiful resort; beautiful beach, lovely staff We booked thru Apple Vacations. The Apple rep at the resort was Manny who was very helpful when one of our suitcases didnt arrive with us. I was very upset but he kept calling the airlines and the airport and within 24 hours after my arrival, it was brought to the resort.The beach was absolutely beautiful and the groundskeepers kept it clean of seaweed and trash. There was always beach chairs available but you had to get there early to get shade. also remember that there are alot of topless women there (in case you have your children with you).The drinks were weak but good. The food was ok but the beef in most of the restrauants was awful and the steak was tough and grisley. Definitely not corn-fed beef. The Japanese restrauant was the best. The breakfasts at the Hispanola were good except the sausages and scrambled eggs were not to my liking as it had some spice in it that I was not use to nor liked. However, we made due with the bacon and the hard boiled eggs. The pastries were to die for.The room was nice and the sheets were very soft and a good thread count. The bed was definitely comfortable. We had a room on the second floor and the baloney was wonderful. It was great to get up and sit out there enjoying your morning coffee. The Domincian coffee was very good. We left a daily tip for the maid and also gave her a few little things for her children i.e. craylons and a puzzle.We went on the speedboat/snorkelling excursion. The staff were very knowledgable and very nice. The snorkelling wasnt the greatest however due to the water clairity. Also we were not able to snorkel at the resort due to the wave action stirring up the sand and poor water clairity due to that. We took halfhour spanish lessons on the beach every morning, given by Juan and he was just great. We enjoyed that very much.Overall, it was a wonderful time and experience. Unfortunately the trip back home wasnt the greatest. We connected in Philadelphia and that airport was awful. They lost one of our suitcases and when we got it back two days later, it was damaged. Also we had to physically take our suitcases from the baggage area for international flights and run to the security area and leave them there so we could catch the connecting flight. Because of that we almost missed our connection. My brother also had one of his suitcases damaged there and it too, didnt arrive with us at our final destination.

<Content>WOW!!!! Absolutely fabulous resort!!!!!! Just returned last night from a week at the Bavaro Princess. I haven't even unpacked yet. We have been traveling to tropical destinations for over 15 years and the very first thing I always remind myself is that you are in a foreign country and things aren ot as they are back home. BUT---this culd be my new home. The Bavaro Princess was beautiful. We upgraded to the Honeymoon suite category so that we would be guaranteed a king size bed and a room with a huge jacuzzi. We also received massages, dinner at 2 of the restaurants that were not include in the all inclusive package and some little extras.When we were told where our room was located, we initially thought we wanted to move----all of the honeymoon suites are at the very rear of the property. But---we decided to sleep on it over night---they were willing to move us if we wanted to move. We decided to stay where we were at as it was much quieter and very close to the smaller, less congested pool. It was very close to the main lobby and the shuttle service. The smaller pool hardly had anyone and it was very easy to get a drink. Maria and Confesor kept us quite satisfied!!!Our check-in went smoothly and quickly. Since we had purchased the upgrade and had the dinners, they had already made our reservations at those restaurants. El Chopin on Friday night---fabulous food and yes, it was all honeymooners on Friday . We were traveling with another couple that had also upgraded to the honeymoon suite and we dined together that night. We had a blast with the staff---all the other couples were just by themselves and so quiet---having that romantic dinner. Guess we were not the norm! We ate at the Cafe Del Mar which I think is one of the best kept secrets. Tiny little restaurant on the beach. during the day is serves as a bar. Everyone we talked to never even knew about it. Candlelit pathways and romantic music playing with the surf in the background. And only 8 of us dining that night. We had the biggest lobster tail I had ever seen and it was delicious! Our other pre-reserved dinner was at Licey. What a fabulous meal there. Excellent service and great food. We made all of our other dinner reservations at one time and never had a problem getting just what we wanted. We didn't eat any dinners at the buffet but always had breakfast and lunch at one of them. The food was hot and plentiful. There was no way you could go away hungry.Our room was on the ground level and very clean. Yes, it is an older hotel but it is kept up. we had a few minor problems with things in the room---like the bottle open wouldn't work and when we called the desk they were there in less than 5 minutes. it was cleaned every day before noon. Remember, the maids have to start somewhere when their work day starts and your room may be early in the day or it may be towards the end of their day. They can't clean every room first thing in the morning. It worked fine for us as we left the room for the day and didn't care what time it got cleaned. We thoroughly enjoyed the big jacuzzi tub. They were constantly working on the grounds---cutting grass, raking, gardening. We even had one of the gardeners ask us if we would like a fresh coconut that he had just harvested. They will cut the top off for you so you can get to the juice inside.We spent one morning at the spa. This was a beautiful, tranquil facility. The services were outstanding. The ONE and only complaint is that the hot tub is not hot---and I believe this is common. no big deal. well worth the money we spent for the massage and nail service. we had free massages included in our upgrade but we added additional time. they have a lot of massage rooms that are set up for couples so it was very nice. they also have a sauna and a steam room that are available to all guests at no extra charge.Transportation at the resort was never a problem. Since it is such a huge facility, there are times that you just want to ride. The shuttles run all the time and it was never more than a 5 minute wait. The grounds are absolutely beautiful. Very tropical and lots of birds everywhere. The most beautiful beach in the world. never a problem getting a lounge on the beach---or by the pool. The main pool had the swim up bar and some days was busier than others. Never hard to get a drink---again--Julio was a fantastic bartender. I have seen his name come up in other reviews and believe is is one of the best.Excursions---we did not book any trips with our Apple rep. And only because we had been there before and didn't want to do the ones they offered. instead, thanks to the Punta cana forum, we booked a catamaran/snorkeling tour through Mike's Marina on the Patatatu. This was the best $60 we spent on a trip. They picked us up right at the hotel lobby and took us to the beach to get the catamaran. The staff on board was helpful, fun, and entertaining. We liked this excursion because it was not an all day trip. the snorkeling was not the best, but that is just because there aren't a lot of beautiful reefs in close proximity.I could go on and on but I think you get the picture. Your vacation is what you make it I would go back in a heartbeat to the Bavaro Princess and would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Best Vacation Ever!!!! After reading the reviews....we were a bit worried about going to the Bavaro Princess.......but do not believe the negative reviews this Excellent hotel is getting......It's fabulous.... This was our 5th trip to the Dominican and believe me the BEST one of all. This is a true 5 star resort.... It's a bit older yes.....but they really know how to treat people right at this resort. They really impressed me and I am very fussy. The service they give is amazing... from the food to the amazing staff ....everything was perfect. This is a huge resort and we NEVER had to wait in line for anything.... No lines what so ever for drinks or making reservations at the Fabulous a la carte restaurant.... The Japanese one was the BEST. Great food and excellent service. We even had a guy walk on the beach every day handing out bottled water..... what service!!!! The best bartender ever is at the swim up bar. Julio is the best, he's very entertaining and a blast. He made sure that everyone had fun and plenty to drink all the time. We could not wait to go at his bar everyday around 4 pm. We had enough of the beach and wanted great fun and excellent drinks so we went to the swim up bar everyday.... and had lots of fun. What more could I say... this was our best vacation ever.

<Content>Beatiful beach and the most friendly people Let me start by saying that I also had my doubts after reading so many negative reviews! But I'd like to assure you that we had a great time and were impressed with the hotel, location, beach, and yes even the food!My friend and I were at the Bavaro Princess from Jan.26th to Feb.2nd. We flew out of Toronto and got there quite late (close to 11pm). Our room was ready, the only problem was we had requested a room with 2 beds and were given a room with one king size bed. This issue was rectified the next day, so no problems at all.Check in  check out - no problem. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The guys we spoke to spoke very good English, and some even French. Because we were leaving late on the 2nd, we asked for a late check out, but the hotel was fully booked. We kept our luggage in our friends room  showered there. We were allowed to keep our towel cards and bracelets so we still had access to all of the amenities. Room - clean, yes, it was a bit older, but how much time do you spend there? The beds were not that comfortable, but the room was spacious and cleaned every day. We tipped our maid a couple of times during the week and didn't notice a big difference with what she did. Nonetheless, they all do work very hard and are extremely friendly.Food - the buffet was pretty decent. We had breakfast at the main restaurant every day; there is always something you can find to eat, even if it's just a croissant and some coffee. There is an omlette station which we never tried. The dinners were good too, great variety, and again always something you'll find to eat. The wait staff very friendly and accomodating, really have no complaints about the people whatsoever. A la carte restaurants - we went to Sakura which was supposed to be Japanese, but it wasn't (more like Chinese), but it's ok, the food was decent and the staff very friendly. We also tried El Gaucho, our favourite - the steak was very good and everything else that came with it. Bella Pasta was decent as well, I had the lasgna and it was good. Remember when you are travelling that there is a chance you will experience 'tourista' so be careful with what  how much you eat  drink. We are tourists so are not accustomed to many things. My friend and I were fine and did not get sick or anything at all. I think when people do report they got sick, it's probably a combination of too much sun, alcohol and the wrong foods...Entertainment - we only went to one or two shows, yes they are cheesy, but the kids really do work hard all day long.Beach - absolutely beautiful. clear white sand, and beautiful tourquoise water. you can walk in either direction for quite a distance and it's just as clean and beautiful. we found the waves were a bit rough the first couple of days, but it seemed to calm down afterwards. either way, it's a gorgeous and very clean beach.Excursions - definitely do the Outback Safari - we had a blast! Our tour guide was Eddy who showed us all a good time. This tour gives you a better idea to the Dominican life and you make many stops along the way. The boogie boarding was fun too :) I would not recommend the Saona Island tour. We were picked up about 6:45 - 7:45 and because we were the first ones picked up, we had an extra hour each way because of all the other pick ups  drop offs at the other hotels. The bus ride to where we took the catamaran was about 2 hours after the last pick up. The Catamarn ride about 1.5 hours...so by the time we actually get to Saona islan it was close to noon...we then left at 2:30 to check out the natural pool with starfish. All in all, this tour was definitely not worth the cost of $90USD. They advertise you're taken to a secluded island, but they dont' tell you how long the commute is nor do they tell you there are thousands of other toursists on this secluded island and vendors constantly harassing you to buy stuff from them. It was a 13 hour day for us and we spend in total about 3-4 hours on the beach  in the water (catamaran  speed boat).

<Content>Beautiful Resort My husband and I really enjoyed the resort. When we arrived, our room was ready within minutes. Staff was great. They carried our bags to the room for us even after my husband insisted that he can manage. Rooms:The rooms were okay. They are a bit older, but okay. Make sure you don't get a room in the 200 buildings, it really smelled like sewerage near those buildings. Ours was fine, It was close to the quieter pool. The bed was a little hard. We were on the first floor and didn't have any bugs, just be careful not to leave the door open. The mini fridge was stocked everyday with water, coke, sprite and some sort of beer. The tv remote had no batteries, one call to the front desk and they were there within an hour. Pools:The main pool was quite busy but no overly noisy. They had activities during the day. There is a swim up bar and lots of shade. The quieter pool was nice. It is smaller but very quiet. They were both very clean. The only downfall was there are not enough chairs.Beach: What can I say, fabulous!!! I was the most gorgeous beach I have ever seen. You can walk for hours in each direction and it seems like it will never end. Very clean, hardly any seeweed. If you walk to the right for about 15 minutes there are some little shops. Don't be scared to bargain. I bought some jewllery and his first amount he said was 50 dollars, everything is 50 dollars. I ended up paying 15 dollars. Food: Let me start by saying I am an extremely picky eater!! The main buffet was good. They have a different theme each night. One night is mexican another is American (there take on it anyway) not what I would call american food but it was good. They have a lot of fish and beans. The breakfast buffet was pretty good. There is a chef making omelletes to your liking. Whatever you want, he puts in. Be sure to tip him he is pretty funny. The restaurant by the beach was pretty good also. The snack bar was pretty lame however. Fries and hotdogs and hamburgers. Not that tastey. If you are picky, I'm sure there is something you can find. The drinks are really good. The banana mama's and the coco loco's were my favorites. They have a featured drink each night which were all really good.Entertainment:I have to say this was my only disappointment. They have a little show at night about an hour or 2. Kind of cheesy but ok. There is no disco and not enough music. There is a piano in the lobby but no one played it the whole week we were there. Excursions:We went on the Outback Safari and the Snorkling trip. The Outback is a must. You hop in the back of a truck and go through villages. You stop at a school briefly. Be sure to bring candy and school supplies. Giving money is discouraged as you don't know where it goes and it encourages begging. The kids are so cute. They give you drawings and flowers. You then continue up the mountain to visit a typical Dominican Home. You also visit a coffee and cocoa farm. You stop at a rum shack. You have a lunch and then head to a private beach to do some boogie boarding. Be sure to grab one right away as there are not that many. If you get Leandro as your guide, you will have a blast. The snorkling trip was also fun. YOu take a bus into town and hop on this little boat. they take you out to the party boat and then continue on to the barrier reef. You get about 30 to 45 minutes in the water. The reef is amazing. Take a waterproof camera with you and give it to your guide. He takes the pictures for you. Once you are done there, they take you to another location where you can swim with manta rays and nurse sharks. This was so cool. If you can get Orlando as your guide, you are so lucky! He pushed us to the bottom so we can touch the rays and sharks. He was wonderful. Back on the boat it's party time. Drinks and snacks. They staff put on a really nice dance show.Overall:WE really enjoyed ourselves. Staff was friendly and helpful. Be sure to tip the maids. They only make 200 per month!! And many of them travel 6 hours to come to work! They really love getting things for their kids. Toiletries, Crayons and coloring books. Also, panty hose is very hard to come by for them. Make a trip to the dollar store.

<Content>Was really good. Well, where do i start. Myself and my girl friend stayed at the bavaro princess from Jan 12 to 19. We did everything online and flew out of Toronto. The flight was good, about 4 hours. We flew into Santo Domingo.From there it was about a 3 Hr bus trip from the airport to our hotel. This was ok because we ended up saving about 1600 dollars by doing last minute and flying into Santa Damingo and not Puta Cana. I would suggest to all if you dont mind seeing some of the country side save your money. We arrived at our hotel about 230 am. When we checked in we payed for a suite but they gave us a Junior suite. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU PAY THE EXTRA 100 DOLLARS AND UPGRADE FROM A JUNIOR SUITE TO A SUITE. The junior suite that they gave us was very damp and musty. It smelled like smoke. The lamp didnt work and the door would not open to the patio. I went down to the front desk and talked to Alfrado. He was very good and told us that he could give us a diffrent room in the morning. We slept there only because it was now about 330 am. The next day Alfrado had a new room for us. The room they gave us was 3226 if i am not mistaken. This room is about a 30 min walk to the beach. He gave us room 302. This room was 3 min to the beach and from our patio we could see the ocean. So as far as rooms go make sure when you check in you get the right room the first time. The maids are great there and look after you very well. The only down fall when it comes to rooms is the plumbing is not very good so the toilet backed up a few times. Not a really big deal but they dont have plungers in the rooms so you have to wait for house keeping to come with one. I would suggest by a small one at Canadian Tire and bring it with you just in case.The food and entertianment was really good. Myself and my girlfriend are picky eaters so we really didnt try alot but had enough to keep us full for a week. The beach and grounds of the resort were unbelievable. We have been to Cuba and the sand there was really white and also hot. The sand here was nice but not as hot as Cuba. The drinks are very strong which was great for myself. We watched 3 weddings in one day and all were really nice. If you want endless spots to take wedding pictures this is the resort to go to. This was a really big resort and had a lot of birds and wildlife write on the resort. I think that this resort would also be great for kids because from what we saw you would have no problem keeping them busy. There was lots of things to do and the pools all seemed to be great. Again i would have to say that we would go back again very soon. The weather was between 28 and 30 degress all week. I hope this helps most people that read it. Happy Vacation Mike

<Content>Resort 4 outa 5 but left with itchy Bumps Overall, Loved the resort Was impressed with grounds, lobby, rooms, buffet and attentive staff. It was worth the $30 upgrade for a suite as we spent a few evenings enjoying the balcony view. The front desk staff was happy to switch us from lower suite to an upper - privacy reason mostly.We came on a small, later shuttle but noticed bigger buses sometimes got great VIP greetings with coconut drinks and occasionally even dancers in the traditional red and blue dresses.The room was large and clean although missing face clothes until we caught the maid and requested them on the 2nd day. She had room cleaned before supper and no complaints there. Room had a little water leakage under air conditioner which was beside the bed. I was sick on bus for 1/2 of one morning on 2 hr hot bus ride to Saona Island to snorkel (still not sure why) I was OK once we got off bus and on the boat. The next day my Sweety got the trots for full day so that could been from rinsing our teeth with their tap water or possible food?- I'd brought prescription antibiotic that seemed to help him recover. It was little hotter on the Caribbean side at Soana Island vs Punta Cana. I didn't see much else I'd go off the resort for as they had an awesome beach at the resort and also Saona Island and we can't beat their weather in our Canadian winters. We went in mid Jan and no sweater was needed either day or night. Always slight breeze so not stifling hot either. The staff aren't looking for tips and remember you when you do leave one. Didn't feel obligated and they were attentive and happy at both pools and no long waits there or front desk.Saw maids picking their own flowers from grounds for rooms? and grounds keepers happy to share opening a coconut for a drink. I took in an awesome massage at the Spa and even did a workout in their exercise room. Dr.s quarters were next door.Didn't see a lot of bugs/insects - the odd mosquito - half the size of the Alberta ones! If that's what bit me they have twice the bite and itch though. Dr said it could have been bed bugs - but my sweety showed no signs of them so gotta wonder - I didn't see anything on sheets either when checked although I did see a few mattresses being replaced. Shopping was close - outside main gate and nice diversion if you don't mind the hassles of come see my shopcompetition specials today etc They don't budge too far off prices and will remember you next day if you bought. Sweety enjoyed the small bar with giant $4 Presidenta? beer in Bavaro Plaza across the street from resort. The paintings can be rolled up if you can spare the extra couple Kgs in luggage - ( we didn't have much - 20 kg each) with Sky Service. Was also relieved we sat in emergency exit as long 7 1/2 hr flight for us. - Still itched for couple days after being home and hope I'm not left with the scars.

<Content>Stay somewhere else Where do I start? We booked two months or so in advance, through redtag. We noticed we were flying into La Romana airport, and although Punta Cana airport was much closer to our resort, we were assured it was the right place to fly into. We had a three and a half hour bus ride dropping off a million other vacationers along the way. When we got to the Bavaro Princess, we went to Check In and found very few employees spoke very little English, and were confusing things we were saying. We got keys to our rooms, but were told to go eat and have a few drinks because our rooms weren't cleaned yet (it was 4 o'clock in the afternoon). We went back to the room after being away from our luggage for hours and found the rooms we got were as far from the beach as possible. There were big holes dug in the ground in front of each door with Caution tape everywhere around some pipes in the ground. The rooms were smelly and had mold everywhere, the bedding, the mattresses, etc. The housekeepers had keys that unlocked the deadbolt and would show up at 8:30 and just walk in, yelling, 'HOLA!' even though you were telling them to wait till later to clean the room. It was completely random, and sometimes you'd be lucky to have your room cleaned by 6 pm.We eventually got a new room, at our own cost, and it was much better. The buffet had lots to choose from, but it was always pretty well the same thing. The a la Carte dinners were great, but you had to pay for the nice ones. The beach was amazing, and the drinks were pretty good. The rest of the trip went off without a hitch until we got home and realized we had been robbed - all of my jewelry, a Nintendo DS, even my birth control. The porters have master keys, and so do the housekeepers - the door had been locked by us earlier. They replaced my jewelry box back into my luggage and robbed us the night before we left, so it much have been someone working who'd know when we were leaving. Me and my friend got bug bites (my doctor says they're likely bed bugs) all over our legs and it's been a week and they're still itchy and horrible.In all: Not a good resort for English-speaking people. 95% of tourists there are Spanish-speaking or Russian. The employees cannot understand us. We got robbed. The rooms are unclean, even though it's a five-star resort. The beach, and the food were good, but the nightlife consisted of a show that ran from about 9:30 pm till midnight, after which the bars and everything else shut down. Not a good place for young people, unless you like a midnight bedtime on vacation.

<Content>Excellent Honeymoon My wife and I stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon after her sister and husband honeymooned there. It was excellent!We booked the Platinum Package.Upon arrival we got out of our shuttle from the airport and told the Bavaro Bellman that we were Platinum and were immediately put in a trolly with our luggage and taken to the Platinum Lounge. We were greated with a drink and a wet towel. Our room was in building 73 which was 100 feet from the beach and the platinum lounge, and about 200 feet from the pool and 3 of the restaurants.The Room:Our room was very clean, no bugs, and very spacious. All of the rooms at the facility are the same size. The only difference we saw was in the patio furniture we had new chase lounges with cushions while others far away from the platinum lounge had whicker furniture. Housekeeping was great (we left a $5 tip every day). When you leave your room put the green card in your door lock that says make the room please our room was always cleaned between 9am and 10am. Nightly turndown service (a platinum feature) was very nice they remade the bed and brought fresh towels.The Pool and Pool Towels:The pool was nice and the swim-up bar with Julio as the bartender was a lot of fun. The resort has nice pool/beach towels, and if you are platinum you get unlimited pool/beach towels. The other guests get one card per person that they turn in for a pool towel and then have to exchange for another towel. If you loose your towel card or the towel it is a $15 charge. Platinum guests also get pool towels left in their room every day. There is only 1 place to get these pool towels so it can also be inconvienent and that is alway were all of the excursion salesmen are so be prepared to asked at least 3 times to buy an excursion when you get a pool towel.The Food:The food was good and we did not go hungry. The buffets offered a wide choice of food and dinner at the main buffet had a nightly theme. There was some evidence of food recycling.A'la carte restaurants:Platinum guests get to make reservations for the entire week at check-in while other guests can only make their reservations for the same day. If the hotel was fuller this would have been a clearer advantage. We enjoyed the steakhouse, seafood house, the gourmet (Licey), and the piano bar. We did not enjoy the Tanuki which was the teppanyaki restaurant. The food at Tanuki was bland the show was very basic. The food at the piano bar (Chopin) was good, but our reservation was for 7pm and the show did not start until 8:30 so we left.The Beach:Get up early - and put your towels under a little hut and then leave. The towels reserve your hut each day and there are not enough to go around. Sign-up often and in advance for the free water sports they were cancelled often because of the wind, so always have a back-up was lost out on sailing because of the wind was too much.The Alcohol:Platinum customers get premium liquor at every bar, but you have to ask because they don't keep it in plain view of all of the customers. Just remember Rum and Coke Imperial The Imperial rum was the best rum on the resort, and never in public view. We bought some off site for $30 per bottle. We asked a bartender and he sold it to us for $20 a bottle. The Dominican wine is horrible and we could not believe people were drinking it; I've had better wine from a box.Room Service:Available 24 hours and free for platinum guests. We ordered a pizza upon arrival and did not like it. We ordered cuban sandwiches and they were good. The menu is lacking because they want you to go the restaurants.Coconuts:If you see a groundsmen climbing trees to gather coconuts or to prune be sure to ask him for a coconut. A $1 tip will get a coconut that was ripe for eating or unripe for the coconut water. Either are great, and we enjoyed them almost every day.In Closing:We enjoyed our stay, but I would guess the resort was only at the most 25% full. If I went during peak season Platinum woud be a must, in the off season the benefits were nice, but not absolutely necessary given the low occupancy. I still would book the platinum for the advantages.

<Content>Good Value for the Money I don't normally write reviews but feel I owe it to other travelers to start doing so.Not super experienced travelers, but for comparison, we have been to both Couples Ocho Rios and Negril in Jamaica, Breezes Bahamas, Xpu-ha Palace in Riviera Maya and this resort.We booked with Apple Vacations, flew nonstop from St. Louis, and did not do the VIP/Platinum upgrade. Didn't seem worth it for us personally.Overall a very nice vacation with only minor complaints. We were always treated courteously by the staff. Check in (and out) was quick and painless. Our room was actually being cleaned when we got there, but we just sat on the balcony and waited.The Room: Suite was not fancy but adequate, looks much smaller in person than in pictures. We had 2 twin beds. Housekeeping was a little different than I'm used to. Our room didn't get serviced until about 4:30-5:00 pm each day. This makes getting ready for dinner or sneaking in a nap a bit difficult. I must say we always had decent water pressure and hot water. Many people complained of trickling /or cold showers.The Grounds: Gardens and landscaping were awesome. Lots of birds, lizards and exotic plants and trees. Resort does show quite a bit of age, but there are maintenace  groundskeepers working all the time--planting, painting, etc. If you walk around the whole resort, there are occasional very smelly areas, which I assume have to do with waste treatment/disposal.The Beach: Fine white sand, no seaweed, and very pretty ocean. Water was much rougher than I expected so didn't get to spend as much time in the ocean as I would have liked. Apparently it is usually calmer. Walked quite a ways north to some nice beach shacks for souvenirs. Was a bit apprehensive but they were quite friendly and not as pushy as I expected, but then again nothing can compare to the salesmen in Jamaica.The Pools: I liked them both as far as pools go. The better one is closer to the beach and has the swim-up bar, but is more crowded. The front/lobby area pool was nice because it wasn't crowded at all.The Entertainment: Your average, sometimes corny, entertainment that most all-inclusives provide. Still better than nothing.Dining: We were there 7 nights: 1st night we did the Hispaniola Buffet, did El Pescador twice, Sakura once, Chopin once, Bella Pasta once, and the Apple Vacations beach barbecue 1 night. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets were adequate with quite a bit to choose from. Similar to other all-inclusive buffets. El Pescador: Both times the service was horrible, almost as if we were invisible. I booked it twice because we love seafood. We had lobster thermidor the first night, which was excellent. The second time we had grilled lobster, which was overcooked. They were just sooo slow. That second time we were there about 2 hours, maybe longer.The Sakura: Excellent, both food and service. Probably the best dining overall during our stay.The Bella Pasta: Was pretty good, food a bit bland but service was top notch. The Chopin: Was not good in our opinions. It was a gourmet buffet and grill, but we both had trouble finding enough to eat that we liked, and we aren't picky eaters. The Tower Casino: We aren't casino people but we checked it out for an hour or so. Not large, but not too bad. The machines seemed to freeze up from time to time.Overall a pretty good stay. A few service issues and some updating needed. Apple gives it a 5-star. I would personally rate it a 3.5 or 4-star. I'm not saying it's a dump by any means, just a few things need to be considered on the rating scale.I will quickly review Punta Cana in a few sentences. The locals always seemed friendly, waving and greeting us. They really seemed to welcome and appreciate the tourists, and not resent that we may be wealthier or have a higher/different standard of living. We always felt safe there. We were never approached to buy drugs and never approached by beggars. That was nice, and as far as I'm concerned an excellent alternative to some other Caribbean destinations where drugs  beggars are a problem.

<Content>The most beautiful place...but I would not return We stayed at the Bavaro Princess quite some time ago, March 2006 to be exact, but never did get around to writing a review. From time to time I always check out the reviews  pictures of this property, and am always surprised that the same complaint STILL keeps popping up...that is food poisoning. That is what prompted me to finally write this review. I had thoroughly researched this hotel for approx. 1 year before booking  the reviews were mostly good. We booked through Air Canada vacations. About 2 months before we left, reviews started showing up regarding food poisoning, which made me very nervous. Even waiting at the airport after check-in I was extremely worried, but other travellers I talked to said to just go  enjoy, all will be fine.We stayed for 2 weeks, and we upgraded to an oceanfront platinum club room, which I believe is well worth the price. We had a beautiful room with a huge terrace, with a view to die for and only 75 steps to the beach. There was no signs of neglect that I could see, and no bugs in the room. And just the convenience of not having to wait in that line up to book your reservations was worth it....it was a breeze. All the staff at the Platinum lounge were friendly  helpful, Anna at the bar was great  made the best CocoLocos, and a special thank-you to Elso of Turinter Tours, who on our last night there personally picked us up in his car  showed us some Dominican nightlife...he took us for pizza, and then to a bar/bowling alley/pool hall  we shot pool. I spoke to the Air Canada rep down there about the food poisoning issue and even showed her the reviews on TA, and she assured us not to worry.As other reviewers have said, the beach is gorgeous. In fact, it is one of the most beautiful beaches we have been to. We had fun playing in the waves and walking the beach. At night after dinner we would usually take a couple of beers to the beach  lay on a chair  just look at the stars and listen to the ocean. It was heaven. The resort grounds are beautiful. We never took the trams anywhere, we always walked as it was too pretty to be zipping around through the property. The mangrove  jungle in the middle was gorgeous....one night that sticks out is when we walked back from Licey through that area around 10ish; the temperature was perfect  the moon was full. It was a storybook moment!We did not do any night shows; I happened to see bits  pieces of the shows but they did not interest us, after all the beach at night was beckoning us. We did some tours: the caving tour was fabulous, I highly recommend it. We did the jeep safari...it was very interesting. We also did the swim in the marinarium one Sunday afternoon...I did think this one was rather lame. We also went to Saona (gorgeous) and sunset horseback riding which was also good.I have wonderful, fond memories of the beauty of this resort, but the one thing that marred our vacation was the food. This is a huge problem here. After worrying so much, the first week went off good. We ate at the all the restaurants. We basically stayed with food we knew, just to be cautious. The food was okay, the pasta stations were good. The Italian restaurant was my favourite, and the buffets were good, but the gourmet Licey I was not impressed with. El Gaucho was just plain terrible; my husband's steak looked like shoe leather, the buns were as hard as baseballs, and I was served a tiny baked potato and a pile of steamed onions....blah! The rest of the food was good, but midway through week two, my husband did not feel well. We tried to tell ourselves maybe he was in the sun too long  suffered heat stroke or something along that line, but it just got worse  worse. He could not leave the room  was in the bathroom 95% of the time. Finally after 2 days, he went to the Doctor (who is very nice), but we had to wait in a line because he wasn't the only one who was suffering from..you guessed it.... food poisoning. She put him on an IV because he was so dehydrated  gave him pills to take, which settled his stomach enough that we could go out with Elso on our last night there, although my husband had no appetite for the pizza. So the last five days were a write off. When we arrived home, my husband did not feel right for the next 2 weeks.....it was just wicked, he has never been so sick in his life. Because there were so many people with food poisoning, the next day I saw a food inspector there  all the food staff were wearing face masks. I told the hotel of our misfortune, and they sent us up milk  bananas (I guess to try  soothe his stomach). On a side note, I did not get food poisoning...but I do not eat meat, whereas my husband did. However, it is very hard to pinpoint where the source of the bug is as this is just such a huge resort with so much staff, it could be anything.That is my experience with this resort, and I am surprised that they are still having problems here. Before we left I told myself that the people who complained were just being picky, or liked to complain about something everyday, or overindulged in alcohol or the like, but even though we were worried, I gave the resort the benefit of the doubt. This is what happened, so those who have experienced this are not fabricating it  just to complain.. ..it does exist here so just be cautious.In retrospect, I feel bittersweet about the Bavaro, that is why I come back here sometimes to look at the pictures  read the reviews.... it does bring back good memories of the natural beauty of the resort, and I really do miss that ...walking through the grounds  the beach at night  the gorgeous countryside. However, we will never return to this resort, nor the Dominican for that matter as the food quality is questionable and let's face it....food poisoning on a vacation is not fun at any expense! Just my two cents....finally!

<Content>Very good value We took our parents on their 50th anniversary to the Bavaro Princess - 11 people in total. I travel all over the world for my job, and have stayed in many forms of accomodations. Whereas the hotel rooms could not really be rated as 5 star as they are somewhat older and in some of our rooms the bathrooms were a bit worn (our bidet was off its screws and the bath had considerable delamination), I found the suites quite good nonetheless. Large rooms, comfy beds, good air conditioning, nice large private verandas, ample closet space, large bathroom areas. The units are generally well maintained, and every concern we had was responded to very quickly. The grounds and beach are breathtaking and well worth the price in themselves. The natural jungle in the middle of the grounds was a wonderful place to walk and hear the birds. The shuttle service was great, the staff generally accomodating although you do have to watch out for some very lazy staff that say they did things and never did. Improvements could be made in a few key areas - food quality was similar to most resorts I have stayed in, but the beef was often of poor quality and the shrimp were never deveined - a prime source of sickness on holidays. Overall however, the buffets were spectacular and offered a huge choice in which there were always some excellent dishes. The sit-down restaurants - I was not impressed with their restaurant booking process at all and avoided it for the most part. Heard many complaints in this area from other tourists. I highly recommend the Japanese restaurant. Drinks - alcohol was very plentiful, but quality of drinks like daiquiris and coladas was poor.

<Content>The worst resort we ever been at!!! My husband and I are frequent travelers out of the country, and we have never had an experience quite like this!After eating at the Japanese restaurant, several hours later we both became terribly ill, as well as several others in our party. So sick, we had to be seen by the hotel Doctor. At the buffets you could see many bugs around and in the food. We lost several days of our vacation due to being laid up in the room. We complained to hotel management both during and after our stay, and they did not offer any satisfaction. Nor did the travel company who put this charter together. Let me tell you about the hotel room.................smelled of mold with visible mold and cracks on the walls and cieling. Leaky malfunctioning plumbing and faulty electrical faulty electrical. We were lucky if our room was cleaned by 5pm every day. If you prefer an oceanview room, there are very few. The only thing we actually liked at this resort was the beach.............very beautiful, smooth, walkable long strech.

<Content>Bavaro Princess We have just returned from spending xmas at Bavaro Princess. I also was very apprehensive after reading some bad reviews. Not only was I thrilled with the location I found it even better than the Grand Palladium Pallace. The Palladium was a bit nicer in the rooms and definitely in the buffets and restaurants for ambience but the food excelled in the Princess. The beach at the Princess was better also. More beach area with soft sand. Lots of room for your lounge chair.We ate at almost every restaurant and were very pleased at each. The lasagne at the Pasta Bella Italian rest. was to die for.El Gacha served the best ARgentia steaks and potatoes.The grilled lobster at the Seafood rest. the best I have ever had.The Japanese rest was also good.We did not like the food at Grand Palladium except for the Mexican rest so this was great to be able to enjoy the food.The rooms were clean and nice. I would not take the ground floor as they do smell musty.There is some water left over from the hurricane that is starting to smell bad but this is not close to the rooms but on our walk to the lobby. We did get lots of bites this trip which could be because of this problem. My teen daughter had lots of sand fly bites but I think this was from being on the beach at night.The beach party is lots of fun. If you have any further questions feel free to contact me[-]

<Content>If this is 5 star, I need to go into the hotel business The Good:- The Location- The Beer- The StaffThe Bad:- Bed bugs- Cockroaches (in my hotel room and in the buffet area)- High pressure sales (to become a member of the Royal Holidays club)- Low food quality (reminded me of when I was a camp counsellor, but worse)I would recommend Punta Cana, but not this hotel.

<Content>book here... it's amazing! Myself and husband are professionals. We travel three times per year with our teenage child. We like five star, no less, and really scour the reviews before we go. This year, we decided last minute to travel. Prices were high, so we wanted a nice resort but refused to pay some of the asking all inclusive rates. I was on the computer for hours at a time, and finally selected the Bavarro based on the pictures. Pictures do speak for themselves. I encourage you to read on, this is an indepth review for you to base your decision on.We booked with Sunwing and left out of Montreal. The flight and the service were fine. No waits, and upon arriving in the Domincan, we walked into the terminal, went thru in a breeze and found our bus with no problems. The tour guide gave helpful information about the hotel, the surroundings ect... however he only spoke in french. When we asked if he could repeat in english, he wasn't able to do so. Not a big deal, we asked someone of the bus to give us and life or death info, which they did, and we were fine. Arrived at the hotel, and because we paid the Platinum rate, which is totally worth it, and i'll explain why in a monent.... they take you aside, and bring you immediately to the Platinum lounge via a tram. The bags arrived shortly after at our door, our check in was smooth, informative, and accomodating. We drank champagne while we waited for several other families to get checked in. The Platinum lounge has two computers, a staff who services drinks and snacks, and always 2 concierges on duty until 11 pm. This staff, Ana, Maria and Juan and Elia, are tactful, professional, kind, educated and speak a miraid of languages. They go to extreme on making you happy when treated with respect. I loved the lounge. We could walk to it from our room,.... we booked all restaurant reservations there, and stopped in during the day for any little thing including american newspapers, canadian newspapers, and my son enjoyed checking his email. The one thing about the computer that I observed is some of the younger adults who love to facebook would overuse the computers which occasionally caused some frustration for those of us, who simply wanted to keep touch with small issues at home. This was a non issue really. The platinum lounge needs two more computers, and needs to watch the overusers.The restaurants. The platinum bracelet gives you a ticket for dinner at Lacey, which if you are not platinum is approx. $34 per person. The restaurant is very nice. A nice end to a long, hot day. The wait staff is friendly, although languge can be a barrier, but a smile goes a long way, and the staff really wants you to be happy. The food is good, and sometimes interesting there. It's a culinary experience, so if you want a huge plate of food, this is not the place to go.Bella Pasta; Italian. Very nice, very rushed... but great food. The only complaint is in the restaurants pants/long are required and it was very hot in there. We had to ask for the fans to be turned on, but we were in great company, so it was a non issue.Tanuki/Japanese. Wonderful food prepared at your table. OUr Chef was not as entertaining as the others, but our food was excellent. Beef, chicken, shrimp, sushi, and nice rice. El Gaucho is a steakhouse. The appetizer soup, pumkin is delicious and we found our steaks quite good. It was tasty, and the staff were kind. I don't recomend the sauces, and I'm only saying this because i felt a tad ill after el gaucho and wondered if it were sauces.The buffet in the front lobby was HUGE, and had something for everyone. My son loved the american table, and whatever you're looking for, you will find it there believe me. The chef took me around and showed me all different foods, he was so kind and sweet to help me, because I have allergies, and i really appreciated it.We had breakfast each morning on the beach and it was wonderful. How can you complain looking out onto beautiful tourquise water, clean beaches and families smiling and destressing. The only thing that makes it negative are people that get agressive because things aren't going there way, and the rest of us have to listen to them be argumentative to the staff. The staff stocked a bottle of my favorite drink and while on the beach would make it for me all day. They learned some english and practices when given the chance.The animation staff really tries to get people up. I don't really want to do aeorobics on the beach, but it seemed fun for those that did, and the music was nice to listen to.There is NEVER ever any demand for chairs. You don't need to get up and reserve a chair ever. The hatched huts do tend to go early so if you like shade, maybe go a bit early. We were given fresh towels each day.The massages for platinum were a nice touch. Myself, husband and son went together to the spa and had our tables in the same room. It was nice. You can upgrade to one hour, but be careful, they gave us one price for an hour and then changed it when we got there for a shorter massage, so it was uncomfortable having to try and explain it, so we gave up trying. I don't suggest the deep muscle at the spa, but I have heard the massage tables at the beach are wonderful deep tissue.You can book a Photo session with your family, which is a nice touch. We dressed up, and waited for two hours on our last day, and the photographer did not show up. We were a bit upset, but went to the beach and it was fine.The beach is clean. Some people complain about seaweed, .... the beach is huge... the sand is beyond compare... who cares about a thin line of seeweed? I really don't understand.Our room was 717, right near the lounge. The balcony is quaint if you like to read a book, or relax. We used it mostly to dry our bathingsuits and other than that, we had champagne delivered on ice each night at 11, via the platinum lounge, so once our son was in bed, we had a romantic evening, and didn't have to go to far from our room.The linens on the bed are crisp, and the bed is NOT a sealy posterpaedic, but not hard like i've read. The pillows are fine, and my son was fine in his rollybed. The bathroom is spacious. The closet is huge. There is an inhouse safe, but do not loose the key. It would be nice to have a combination lock like in mexico so you didn't have to watch the key all day.The water was HOT all the time. Not once did we not have steamy showers. We kept the lights on, as I had read reports about bugs, but not once did i see a cockroach, but feel bad for those who said they did. Sometimes these things could happen, yet, it's so easy to spray,.... they are so used to these things there, it probaby doesnt' alarm them like it would us. Keeping on track, I didn't see any bugs. Ants in the gardens can be bad in someplaces, so I don't suggest a long chat near the garden without shoes. Some people are bothered by the mosquitoes, but it must be this time of year, but I have no bites and they usually love me.My son loved the pool and the kayaking. The beach party is so much fun on Sunday nights, and a great place to go. The other entertainment is a a bit lame, so if you're really into those things, perhaps this isn't the resort. It was slightly high school entertainment, so I think they could work on that.The photo sessions on the beach are fun for the kids. They have monkeys, iguana, tropical princesses, and at night by the front lobby you can have pictures taken with the beautiful domincan dancers, and for $15 each, they are a great keepsake, and done very well. It's true, they do make the rooms up about 4, but why earlier?,.... why would you be in your room so early in the afternoon, and really... if it's so important, I can tidy my room in five minutes on vacation!! Listen, it's all what you make of it. As a very picky person, i loved my room. It had an ambiance about it. Not new and fresh, but lived in and quant. We met some wonderful people, but truly can't say enough about the staff. They really do try hard. If you are platinum, you will recieve some cigars and also some rum and a fruit tray upon arrival. Please say hello to Ana and the rest of the concerieges, who we left gifts for before we left because they were so kind. If you can afford a trip a few one dollar bills go a long way there. Not many people tip, but really, for totally catering, a few dollars is well received. If you are having any doubts, don't. I want to go back soooooon. I would request the same room, and the same upgrade, it's worth it. You will love your time there, and mostly just laugh at the people who make such a big deal out of small things like lights not working beside the bed, or three beers short in the fridge ect. It's all inclusive, go to the bar. We drank top shelf all week, and it was great. Have a great time, it's totally worth it...Lauri, John and Mitchell, Ottawa, CanadaIf you want any specific info, the email is mitchellitis@hotmail.com

<Content>Great Holiday I highly recommend this resort and going Platinum.They have a special lounge for the platinum people only, 2 PC/internet, daily snacks, well stack bar (you can also serve yourself) (cognac,drambuie/bailys/amarreto) champagne/wine/soft drinks/coffee/water in the fridge just help yourself, they also have Budweiser (yes in Punta Cana) wow, you can also bring anything back to your roomYou check in/out at the lounge, so no line up you book all your a la carte (5) at lounge in one go.Spacious room near the lounge/beach, nice terrace with 2 lounge chairs/cushion and a small table.Bathrobe/slippers and beach towel in the room, mini bar stock daily and 3 bottles of booze in the roome (vodka/rum/wiskey)Gorgeous beach, but recommend in high season to put your towels around 7AM for a palapas.Highly recommend the gastronimic restaurant (Lycee) free for platinum if not 30.00 per person, it's like a 5 star restaurant in Canada, excellent service, filet migon just melt in your mouth and the wine is very very good, compare to all the other a la carte/lobby but the rose is OKThey have a little train that passes every 5 minutes to take you around the resort as it's a very big resortAnna at the Platinum Lounge, Jose at the Lycee, Raoul at the Lobby all great staff will go out of their way for you

<Content>Great Value Had a great time. If you are a beach person you will love this place. The beach is absolutly beautiful.With regard to all the posts about getting sick... I'm happy to say none in our group of four had any problems. Please use the same caution when visiting any foreign country. Don't eat cut fruit, don't eat the salad bar, don't eat cold items that have been handled by the local people. Stick to the hot cooked items. I know the fruit trays and salad bars are beautiful, but it's just not worth the risk.See your family doctor before traveling and take along antibiotics in case you get sick. Your doctor will prescribe the appropriate one for the country you are visiting. There are shops north of the resort about a mile on the beach and south of the resort abut three quarters of a mile. Take sandals for this one as it extends out to the road and the sand is mixed with glass and pins etc.Shops are also located across from the entrance of the resort.We found most of the staff extremely helpful with very few American haters (there are some). Most of the workers are relatvely unskilled but very friendly. You will find that the pretty much will reflect the attitude that you display to them. Try some spanish even if it's pathetic, you will have fun and they will appreciate it greatly. Take ones and fives as you will have some difficulty obtaining change. Tips go a long way, no you can't buy respect and you don't want to be the ugly demanding american but you will get better service.With regard to the booze... If you like rum you are in luck. Dominican rum is among the best. If you want a strong drink just ask for rum straight (Brugal is nice) then add it to your drink. We didn't go for the platinum upgrade. Walked by the Platinum Lounge looked absolutely boring.If you want the better booze ask for it and tip the bartender. Quality liquor goes around the main buffet on a cart we had no trouble getting any of it (La Romana Sambuca is very nice) Drambuie on the cart and many others.It helps to sit in the same section of the buffet and make friends with the waiters in that area. (Ramone was absolutely great)The only disappointing food was the lobster thermadore at the Pescadore (spelling in question) It was room temperature and the service was bad. There was an obvious anti American atmosphere there. We left and went to the main buffet.The Japanese habachi is humorous, they give you a menu take your order and then serve everyone the same thing. Ask for Saki it was the best part. Go with the flow and have fun. I did eat the sushi at the Japanese restaurant, mild disturbance the next day. Guess I broke my own rule...

<Content>Don't believe bad reviews How anyone can dislike this Resort is beyond me.Check-in was quick and efficient. We arrived at 12:30 pm and were quickly taken to our room where we found everything to be in order. My husband discovered that there were only 3 bottles of beer in the fridge. A quick word to our porter and the matter was resolved within 5 minutes. Five more bottles were brought to us and every day after we had at least 5 - 6 beer in the fridge.The room was very clean and lots of air movement with the windows open. We did not find a need for the air conditioner but did use the large fan in the bedroom. Yes, there are almost microscopic ants on the counter in the bathroom. Not a big deal. Just wipe them away. These things happen in the tropics. They won't hurt you.The grounds are very large and quite beautiful. There is a huge mangrove swamp which contains walkways into a bird sanctuary. This is a great experience. Unfortunately we were there during hurricane Olga on December 11'th and the significant rain caused flooding in this area and it was impossible to enjoy our daily walk through.We can't say enough about the employees of this resort in regard to the manner in which they handled the hurricane problems. They constantly mopped floors, dumped water down toilets in the lobby when the water wasn't working, moved activities into the lobby to keep guests happy and they were able to produce great meals. This was all done with smiles and a genuine sense of concern for their guests.The food at this resort is fine. We did not eat at any of the specialty restaurants as we prefer buffets. Not everything will be to everyones liking but you can always find lots to make a meal of. We certainly didn't starve here.We have travelled extensively and this has to be the best beach we have ever seen. It is great for long walks. The water is perfect. Perfect colour, perfect temperature. In closing I must reiterate, don't believe the bad reviews. Your vacation is what YOU make it. If you go in with an attitude and extreme expectations, you will have a rotten time no matter where you go. Enjoy your stay and try to laugh off the small stuff. I'll bet you would love this resort!

<Content>Loved it I stayed here with my wife a few years ago. We loved it. The place is gigantic. The beach was beautiful, and so were the rooms. The buffet was ok for breakfast and lunch, but the dinners were fantastic. The hotel staff was extremely friendly. The majority of the people there speak Spanish, but if you don't speak any, don't worry, the hotel staff all speak English and were great. I'd stay here again.

<Content>very,very bad !!! My family vacation was ruined by terrible service in this hotel.There were no water and toilets were leaky. Rooms was full of roaches and was not cleaned until 5 p.m. Some problems was with towels to change. Overall the place is generally insanitary due to shortage of water.  Alex, New York.

<Content>Very nice resort I wrote a couple of days ago from the resort. My review is still not posted by Tripadvisor. I will give the update now. This resort is very nice and pretty. I went with Apple Vacations from newark and was a platinum guest. My friends were not. Bad: saw 1 roach when I first entered the room. The bug came from under the door and has not re-appearred. Based on what I read here i brought Raid, bed bug spray, and the black and decker electronic bug deterrents. The 2nd sink is broken but again that is not a showstopper. Also, 1 drawer was broken but with 6 other drawers, it is not an issue. It rained almost every day for about an hour and all day on the Tuesday when I wrote my other review. After the rain storm I did see a huge spider in my room that the Raid did not kill. I had to step on him. It was a big spider 3-4 inches long that probably came from the beach when the door was opened by the maid or me. Remember that you are int he tropics with doors that open right to the outside. My friends brough roach traps that killed some bugs in their rooms.Food: The best restaurant we went to was the Japanese place which is Hibachi. We had plenty of food and the service was great. Chopin (buffet) was nice. Pescador was very good. Gaucho was a basic steakhouse and good. Bella Pasta was bad. It is not 5 star US restaurant style but at a par with a TGIFridays or Benihana. They do require men to wear pants for dinner so please pack a couple of pairs.Pool: I spent a lot of time at the pool. We grabbed chairs under one of the huts by the pool bar each day. We were there by 9:30am since most chairs are taken by 10. You just need to put a towel down to reserve a chair. The pool is very big and you can do laps by the volleyball net. the bartenders are really nice and never have their hands out for a tip. There really was never a long wait for a drink at any of the bars. The worst time to get drinks is at the pool when there is a passing storm since everyone runs there for cover. The beach was nice but we did not spend much time there. At both the pool and beach the excursion companies will hound you to signup. Excrusions: I did the Kontiki party boat and Marinarium snorkeling. My friend did the ATVs. I recommend Kontiki to anyone over 18 that wants to drink and snorkel at sea. The crew is awesome and they entertain well. The only downside is they do not have a dock and take you from the beach to the boat in smaller boats. Marinarium was not great. There were very few fish when snorkeling. My friend loved the ATVs and says he would do it again.Staff: The staff is very courteous and nice. They never asked for a tip, not once. i think in about a week I tipped maybe $20 total not including the maids. They work incredibly long hours. The young staff in the night time shows are up by 10 watching the kids. at 9 they are doing the pre-enteraintment. At 10 is the nightly show. Then they get everyone involved with Merrengue and Salsa dancing from 11-12. At 12 they practice for future shows until about 2. The shows are entertaining but do ot expect Broadway. The kids are good dancers and lip synch the words. The Fri show was the American one and very good. Comparison: the only other all inclusive I was at was Club Med in Turks which is an 18 + party resort. Here is my comparison. Breakfast and Lunch- Turks was better with a nicer buffet selection. The selection at Bavaro princess was kind of boring. Dinner is much better at the Bavaro Princess with all the restaurants. Rooms-The rooms are much better at the Bavaro princess. At Club Med they are like Youth hostel rooms.Nightlife-Nightlife is much better at Club Med, probably because i am single. It is all singles and couples and the music in the nightclub is more American. In both places the staff tries with the girls who are guests. At Club med the staff is much more aggressive. At the Bavaro princess the staff became friends with the single girls through the meringue and salsa dancing. The last night I was there i saw a few of them smooching at the Arieto nightclub. At all the Punta Cana nightclubs you will see prostitutes and locals trying to get American women. Both places have late night food.Platinum- Platinum may not be worth it unless you want to go to the other Princess resorts. The massage and cigars were nice. The internet was not always working well at the lounge since it is a satellite signal. I think my room was a little nicer because it was platinum but my rum ran out and they did not replace it, even after I asked. all rooms will get a golf umbrella but still bring a rain coat.Overall- The place is very nice and perfect for couples and families. The single scene is weak. Expect a lot of Russians, Germans, Canadians, and some south americans. Not many people from the US were there. it is very worth the cost. I would probably go back to a Princess resort again but the 18 and older location. Feel free to contact me if you have questions.

<Content>Keep Off!!! I do not know what to start with. The problems started first minute we came in and last through the whole week. First 鈥?check-in. It took over 3 hours to get keys. And after that 鈥?the room was not ready yet! And it took another hour to get baggage from front desk. Second 鈥?utilities did not work properly. We had to call service every other day. No water in the room, leakage from upstairs, poor cleaning, etc. And the WORST was FOOD. It was real POISON! There were 11 people in our group, and 9 of them got sick from the food. It wasn鈥檛 at one day. It was during whole week. More, we spoke with other tourists (from Canada, Europe), and they had casualties too. Guys! If you want to enjoy your vacation 鈥?STAY AWAY! - Unlucky vacationers from NJ.

<Content>Amazing! This resort was huge and beautiful! The service was great. The staff always went above and beyond to help us. The a la carte's are simply beautiful! The buffet at the lobby is almost as good as the restaurant. The beach is huge and the sand was cleaned nightly. There are many evenets for kids to take part in as well as the adults. My boyfriend and I were a little worried think that this may be m ore of a family resort...it's not. There were lots of young couples there as well as famalies. They had a huge beach party on Sunda night and it was a blast. OUr room was cleaned every morning! Our room was beautiful. We were in building 1 right in front of the beach!!!

<Content>Good Holiday, maybe 4 star resort My wife and I stayed for 1 week and just got back. Zoom airlines is 5 out of 5 for food, movies, service and being on time. Next time we will definitely fly into Punta Cana, the 4hr bus communte from Santo Domingo was pretty brutal. Cool to see the entire area, including the crazy driving/drivers/bikers but try to avoid it!Resort was huge. Tram to go to lobby/restaurants/beach was available, but with all the food/drinks that were consumed we appreciated a little walking to and from. Some (fat) people would wait a long time for the tram and would probably complain about it, we often beat them to the beach. There is smelly area on the walk which but we went through the walking path instead going past caged exotic birds/parrots and huge iguana's.Food was decent, better than other 3 or 4 star places, with 9 ala carte restaurants to choose from. We really like the Bella Pasta restaurant, great food there. Next time we will probably skip the others, buffet was also good. The theme nights were a good idea to give some variation. Mexican night was the best.Beach is great, cleaned before 7am each day. Waves were perfect to fool around in. With it being very windy throughout the day the pools are very dirty in the morning, but by afternoon, they were cleaned up.We skipped Entertainment each night (not worth the break in our drinking). Bar or food service was much better with tipping, is that different at otherplaces???? The last night we were there we had a big fight with about 6 roaches and got no sleep, I decided it was b/c they had no door sweeps so there is a gap under the door for whatever to come in. If it had happened on day 1 would have ruined our vacation. I won't go back until I know that problem is ratified. Shame b/c besides that we would go back in March. Not sure now.

<Content>Great Honeymoon! My husband and i were just at the BP for 10 days 9 nights for our honeymoon. I have been reading other reviews and have to laugh at some people.I agree with some of the comments people have complained about or loved. I Think people need to remember this isn't america this is a third world country for petes sake. 5 star to them may be a little different than our 5 star. i would agree this wasn't the Hilton or anything but it was very very clean and very tropical. The grounds at our hotel were amazing. Very perfect at every corner.We had the upgrade the platinum package which i would recomend for everyone its only 30 more a day for your trip. THe upgrade got you any type drink all top shelf, american beer anything. A free couples massage, a bottle of rum vodka and whiskey in the room, a special lounge just for platinum guests, free internet use. REservations at the only resturante on site that is not free, free for platinum though. The entire stay was so very relaxing! We layed on the beach every day, got up early to watch the sunrise stay up late to see the sunset. Very romantic. I do agree and must say the food was interesting! But neither one of us never got sick in 10 days there. The food just wasn't what we normally eat but when is it when you go on vacation! The staff at the resort we thought were so incredibly friendly. They were always trying to accomadate anything we needed and if you tip the servers and bar tenders right off the bat they will do whatever you need!The roads in the DR were a little crazy they made it very interesting to go outside of the resort, its crazy everyone has the right a way and really there is no rhyme or reason to the way they pick who gets to go first. But it made us laugh.One thing to remember is to bring most of your money in 1 dollar bills, and for tips you dont want to be dropping 5's and 10's :) Its just a bit difficult to get change so bring it wth you. They had safes in the room where you can leave everything of value.The first trip we did was the ATV's four wheeling that was bar far a 10! It rained the entire time which made it very very wet and very muddy which was a blast. Don't wear white, we wore our bathing suites with old crappy clothes over them. All the tour guides are tri-lingual or probably even more so we were always comfortable on the trips. We also did the Saona Island trip which was very fun and very relaxing. if anyone has seen the corona commercial where they are relaxing on the beach thats exactally what it looked like. It was so beautiful! the last trip we did was The jeep safari was a fun trip as well, rained again that day, which made the roads very muddy and wet! Fun for jeeps. Outside of the resort if very poor and makes you truly thankful for what we have! That's why I can't believe how rude people are being on this trip advisor. So overall i would tell everyone to come here be open minded just lay on the beach, drink a beer and relax!

<Content>If you like roughing it you may like this place I am not one to complain, but I wouldn't want someone to go into this blind. I am one of three thirty year old women that were just interested in a relaxing vacation. What we got was the run around at check in time (check in time is 3pm and we got into our room well after 6pm). We were offered the special room to change into our bathing suits upon arrival, and the room was trashed and we wouldn't want to know what was going on in there the night before, but we had an idea. Not the best first impression. Finally when we got into the room the toilet didn't work (wouldn't flush toilet paper, and would bring up other peoples faeces), LOVELY! We got there on a Sunday and they didn't move us until late afternoon on Tuesday, so we would go and use the lobby bathroom. When we got into our next room the toilet didn't work, so we had someone in to fix that. That was the end of our toilet problems, but on came the ongoing harassment from the male staff that didn't understand the word no. Constant cat calls and baby, baby comments became very annoying. They would ask us to go out to the discos with them, but if they were acting this unprofessional and pushy while being at work, what would they be like outside of work. Pretty Scary thought. I could go on with the other bad experiences, but to sum it up, I think because we were all female, that didn't make a big enough fuss about our problems, they really didn't care about making sure we were happy. I don't know about you, but when I pay to go on vacation, I want the memories to be great and not something I have to spend time after warning others to prepare themselves for disappointment if they are going to that resort.

<Content>Warning Read this Before you Book! I flew down with a party of 6, of which 3 of us became terribly ill from the food. There were other people on the resort who were very ill, so I don't think this was a coincidence.One person had to have emergency IV We saw the doctor and her explanation was that we contracted an infection from the food. We were sick 5 days out of 7, and when we finally saw the doctor, on our check out date, she wanted to administer the IV to us because of our condition. We declined and are home now waiting to see our own doctor. The doctor service I must say was very good.About the food, I see some reviews were saying the food was excellent and the ala carte was good. That for us is far from the truth. The food tasted very plain, the ala carte restaurants had fake Asian food, but what do you expect from the Caribbean? The food was by no means 5 STAR like advertised. If anything 2-3 star. I must say one of the ala carte restaurants we did like was El Goucho steak house, that was good, although on our last night we couldn't really enjoy our good bye dinner because we were ill.The rooms were dated, not totally clean, musty smell, and all our clothes came back smelling musty. One other couple who went with us suffer from mold allergies, every night their throats swelled and they coughed. I must also include the beds were horrific. IF YOU HAVE A BACK PROBLEM, DO NOT STAY HERE YOU WILL REGRET IT!! Springs were popping up and when we went to the Guest Services to have them do something about it, they said oh for sure, and it wasn't until our last night there that we complained to the manager that they sent out a new bed which wasn't much better, although better than the one before.The service fluctuated from being good to ignore mode. Very frustrating. I think the problem was short staffed on occasions. Maybe some of the staff was getting sick? The grounds were very nice, I must say it was a nice place except for an area that smelled like it was a septic area filled with jungle. The pools were average, could use some cleaning and tubs might as well be called cool tubs, not that normally you would want that, be were sick so that would have helped our aching bodies.The beach however was beautiful, but there are many resorts on that beach.Last year we stayed at the Melia Caribe, that was a great experience. We were expecting something similar but we were sorely disappointed and we will never recommend or stay at this place again.

<Content>Not a 5 star resort First trip to the Dominican Republic and the worst hotel ever!! I will never go back. When my boyfriend I first checked into the room and looked it over there was blood on the bathroom room door, when I complained they said they would sent someone to clean it, on the third day I finally cleaned it myself. The room was never cleaned, the maids just came in and made the beds and changed the towels. This service was never completed before 5:30pm. The towel service at the pool and beach was on some days more than a 20 minute wait. We were told that there was a disco on site, when we arrived we were told that it was outside of the hotels grounds. There was no bottles of rum in the room and no welcome baskets that we were told that other guests recieved. The over all service is not something I would have expected from a 5 star resort. I was very disappointed with the hotels over all and would not recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Great time in the Dominican I went with my now fiance (I proposed there) and found the Bavaro to be beautiful. The grounds were well cared for and the lobby gorgeous. My travel agent booked through Apple and there was an Apple rep in the larger lobby area. This was both convient and comforting. The beach was the most beautiful I've seen. Plenty of room and seats to sunbathe. Our room was spacious and clean. A wet bar in the room was just right for evening cocktails on the porch of our room. The staff were friendly and courteous. We did, however, have problems with water pressure in our room. Though the food selection had a wide variety, it was only fair tasting and left us with minor stomache trouble. The entertainment had an impressively wide range, but could be amateurish at times. All tried hard though wich made it, for the most part, fun. The beach and pool area had a burger and hot dog stand. It was so bad it had an almost comic value! AVOID! While we were there, a fire burnt down a large building! near the pool and beach closing at least 3 restaurants. Even so, there were still plenty of places to eat and drink and the staff worked very hard to clean up and make up for the loss. The grounds are HUGE and though they have regular shuttle service to and from the rooms and lobby, be ready for long walks. Not the fanciest place in the world but was appropiately priced and I had a great time.

<Content>Not What We Expected My wife, aunt, sister in law, cousin and her husband and myself stayed here for a week. Not what we expected but perhaps we expected to much. This is our 2nd trip to Punta Cana. In 2005 we stayed at the Riu Palace Macao and had no complaints what so ever. The exterior and grounds of the Princess were great but the interior of the rooms were in need of updating. You can tell that when this resort was new it was top notch but it has been let go. Rooms needed painted, furniture old, rooms not totally clean (cobwebs all over along with dust), don't think they mopped the floors. Food overall was pretty good with the Chinese being top class. The pools (nice) but needed cleaned. Beach was great.We have also stayed at 5 all-inclusives in Cancun, all of which were better then this.We will not return here nor would we recommend it to anyone.Had a good time but dissatisfied with resort.If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me.

<Content>Beautiful resort, great food, outstanding!! We went to this resort with another couple, aside from all the crazy reviews written. All the photos were amazing, the good reviews were outstanding, and the bad reviews, were mainly over petty things (how long of a wait for room service, etc - are you on vacation or WHAT??)Our experience was absolutely AMAZING! The grounds are beautiful, the staff is friendly, the food choices were incredible... I could go on and on!We were in the Platinum Suites - 2nd bungalow in from the beach - FANTASTIC! The beach was simply stunning - Honestly, on our 3rd day there, we were all wondering about the negative reviews and simply thought they could NOT have stayed at this resort, there must be some mistake!! Not ONE of the complaints that were posted were anything close to being true - and we met others there who read the reviews as well and thought the exact same thing.The food - where can I start?? The choices are abundant - the only tip - book your a la carte dinners the day you get there (or the 2nd day) as they book up fast, but are well worth it! The first restaurant was Mare Norstrum at another Princess resort - and it was FANTASTIC!! We also went to Licey's (which was actually not that great, considering people who don't upgrade to Platinum have to pay $30/person), Sakura which was great as well, El Gaucho - the steaks were good, as well as the Argentian Salad!! The rooms were great - spacious and clean - flowers left in your room everyday... housekeeping was very friendly!If you are expecting to be waited on hand and foot, with nothing but your favorite, most expensive foods offerend 24/7, and someone there to wipe your a$$ - definitely stay at home! BUT, if you are looking for great service (yes, sometimes you need to wait a MINUTE for a drink!), great food with lots of selection, beautiful beach, fun pool and friendly service - Bavaro Princess is where to go! We will definitely return!!

<Content>Quite an exprrience My stay was 10/26/07-11/02/07. Tropical storm NOEL. Upon our arrival we had an OK room near the main lobby. The floor of the bathroom was a little wet. We thought at first it was the air conditioning, but by the next morning it was about 3 inches flooded. We contacted guest services the evening before,but they didn't help. We spoke with our Apple Vacations rep after breakfast and within an hour the hotel manager was there. He upgraded our room and by 4 o'clock we were up by the beach,sitting on our porch,watching the rain. We were very comfortable there for the week. Had some very tiny ants in the bathroom and bar sink. We expected that with all the rain and tropical climate. Food was good,drinks were awsome! Problems finding food from 10pm to 12am. Munchie time and no munchies. Many children screaming and crying around the pool. Couldn't relax. Alot of kids, everywhere,crying. In my opinion,more family resort then couples or honeymoon resort. Most employees spoke some English and were vere friendly. You can get some good deals from beach vendors if you are willing to work them down on their price. Beach aerobics were great! Wish it hadn't rained 5 days. Not much to do at night unless you like little casinos or a stage show. Overall it was fun. More sun and less rain would have been nice. Also more nightlife would have been nice.

<Content>RD not any more a travelling choice I have just return from a 14 days stay in that pricess hotel. On arrival my agent ask for beach view.... they gave my the most far door from the beach you can have at this hotel, the room smell mould a lot, there was black mould all arround the bath tub, the door on patio side have been forced so it was not possible to lock it, it is a fist floor room. We had to spend more than half an hour with the reception to have an other room. The other room on the same model except my wife and i had to sleep on twin bed because they had only this room with twin beds to offer. The room was not clean because there was sans on the floor, burn and broken fixtures in the bathroom, also there was some birds excrement on the door frame. The first morning we want to use the coffee maker but there was no electrical outlet near by for it, the wire was 1 foot long, we hade to use the bathroom outlet.After few days we notice, the small fridge in the room was not refilled every day as per advertised we had to ask for beer and soft drink, There was no face cloth, we ask for 2 but they could find out only one for us, some days we had 3 towels some days 2, some days 4, some days we had body lotion some days conditionner some days shampoo and most of the time we had to ask to have something who was missing. The only thing they do okay it the beds and that's allThe food was good but the service is very very poor even for the buffet, there is some food or beverage who was only served by waiter, but be very patient and repeat often what you want and be patient again. There is 5 a la carte restaurants food is good but one night at the Japanese they were washing the floor, wich was very dirty, while we were eating, after the lunch the waiter told us to to go into the entrance to have our desert.... on a very low table... a pain. on the second week there are some friends (5) who have been sick after eating in the Japenese restaurant.The personel of the hotel seem to be nice only if you tip, they don't do think if you don't tip. They are arrogant and they do not us to spend any more money in their hotel and countryThis is not a 5 stars hotel this may be 3 1/2 Stars at the most but they charge for a 5 stars and they irritate you all the time with a dolars, even my wife was ask for a dollars at the hotel jewellry guy while she was looking the jewellery in the counterI DO NOT RECOMMAND BAVARO PRICESS HOTEL EVEN I WILL NOT RETURN TO DOMINICAN REPUBLICA I WILL SPEND MY MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE

<Content>Loved the Bavaro Princess Went to the DR punta cana Oct. 13 - 20. Was the most relaxing vacation me and my husband had ever been on. First time to the caribbean. Booked with AC platinum.Beach was sooo beautiful. Never had a problem getting a hut thing, could be that it was off season. People are so nice and friendly, always a Hola. Some didn't speak much English and we do not speak much spanish however I did write down a few phrases I thought I might need, always found a way to communicate. Remember you are in the caribbean it's your vacation relax enjoy . Yes it's a much slower pace eg. asked for extra sugar in room ( bring your own coffee, there is a coffee maker in room takes basket filters, we took tim's so glad we did)extra sugar took 3 hours to get no biggy hubby went to platinum lounge and got some until it arrived. Asked for an ashtray in room took 2 days., no problem , use to smoking outside anyway and there are ashtrays all over the resort. The rooms were spaceous and clean. Had our own loungers on our patio.Grounds were very well maintained it's a big resort but there is a trolley that runs frequently besides the walk is nice.Food ,there is something for everyone we are picky eaters and one of us has IBS which limites food choices to begin with but we always found something to eat. Morning breakfast buffetafternoon El Gaucho had a buffet for lunch and dinner we did the a la carte resturants El Licey and Bella Pasta were our favourites.Did one excursion the tropical storm snorkling its okay a real eyeopen to what is on the outside of the resort ( we arrived a night).We are definately going back.

<Content>Prepare yourself for a nightmare We went to Bavaro Princess for a Wedding with about 25 people. the trip started off good the hotel is visually beautiful and beach is amazing. That's were it ends....the customer service is the worst I ever received - I can go on and on about that. For intance waiting for room service for over an hour on more than one occasion. Wating for a day for an addtional blanket. Everytime you called to follow up on requests for room service - you were received with an argument on the phone asking am i sure that i spoke to that person etc.We had about 5 or more from our group that became ill from the food one even had to be taken to the hospital during our stay. The night of the wedding no special accomidations were made for the bride or the groom. the reception was held outside in a sectioned off area that the staff continued to let other guest walk right through reception party (we actually had a drunk hotel guest come up during the reception and ask if he could have a piece of cake).these are minimal examples of things gone wrong - it was a short story horror. what ever customer service mishap could happen - happened. after the first two illnesses i was so afraid to eat i stuck with bread and rice. I still got sick came home and was in bed for two full days. IF YOU STILL HAVE TIME MAKE ANOTHER RESERVATION IF YOU ALREADY MADE IT HERE. If you havent made one yet - DO NOT MAKE IT WITH TIS HOTEL!!!!

<Content>Loved the Princess We booked this and then worried when we read the terrible reviews. My husband and I we pleasantly surprised when we arrived. We had the platinum package which I would recomend to everyone. The staff is extreamly helpful, and friendly. A few problems did come up, but were taken care of immediatly, there were small bugs in our room, we realized they were from the flowers that housekeeping left in our room as soon as we got rid of the flowers the bugs were gone. The food was excellent, like any place else some were better(japanese), then others(seafood), there was always something good at the buffet. The beaches were amazing, we never had a problem finding a chair, infact there are three beds in the beach we noticed that one was almost always empty. The grounds are large but never had a hard time getting around, we mostly walked everywhere, there were great trails through mangroves with great trees, birds, and other animals to look at. While there we heard people with different complaints mostly that employees spoke spanish, what do you expect when you go to a foreign country, most of the staff tried to communicate as best they could I really didn't find this a problem, and I do not speak spanish fluently but know a few basic words to get me by. I think this was the best vacation for the money.

<Content>would not return My husband and I booked this trip for the purpose of a relatively inexpensive, long weekend chance to get to the beach. We knew when booking that the resort was not going to be the same quality as other, more expensive, resorts where we have stayed in the past. We learned that you definitely get what you pay for.FOODWe only ate the buffet restaurants. We had reservations for the Italian restaurant for our last night, but by then I was so sick with some sort of food poisoning/fever that we could not make it.The lobby buffet was ok - in general the lunch was better than the dinner. They had theme nights for dinner and they were pretty bad. They always had a pasta bar and an American theme bar, but the American bar was pretty gross looking. The nachos and french fries were ok, but that was about it. We had the beach buffet one afternoon and that was my favorite meal while at the resort. The view couldn't be beat and the food was good (the pistachio ice cream was my favorite). However, there's no air conditioning in either buffet restaurant and you spend most of the meal sweating.DRINKSI'm not an alcohol person, so I was more than happy with the pina coladas and coco locos that I ordered like crazy. However, the drinks are served in plastic cups (very tacky) that make you feel like you're at a frat party. The house beer wasn't bad according to my husband. There is a bar on the beach, which is nice, but unlike any other resort I've been to, there is no waiter service around the pool, so you have to get up each time you want a drink. POOLThe pool was large and looked great in all the pictures. However, it was not well maintained and should have been much cleaner. There were also a lot of drunk people hanging out by the swim up bar (shocking, i know) but it made it a less relaxing environment and felt very cheesy.BEACHThe beach was the most beautiful that I have ever seen. The ocean was perfect - warm with just the right amount of waves. I was surprised to find that I was just about the only woman with a top on, so be prepared for that.The housekeeping staff and the maintenance/groundkeeping staff seemed to work very hard and that should be mentioned.I would not return to this resort. Part of it is the horrible association I would have with how sick I became while there and part of it is just that it is not very luxurious and was lacking in hospitality.

<Content>Lizards/Bugs in the room Stay away from this resort! Our room came with :patio lights that worked sometimes, lamp in living room did not work, kitchen sink did not work, shower had only a trickle of pressure, kitchen counter had small bugs, maid service at 9:30 p.m. , cockroaches, lizards inside the room, a filthy dirty floor and terrible cleanliness.When we talked to mgmt. , they sprayed the room for insects and gave us a fruit basket  bottle of rum. We were never offered another room.We were falsely accused of taking a photo from the pictures they take  sell. WE WERE CLEARED OF COURSE! Kinda hard to take something(a photo of us w/ a monkey), we never had . We opened our towels  beach bag, showing an untruthful accusation to be ridiculous! We never had our photo taken with a monkey!the food was fine. The steak house was great, as was the service in every other area of the resort.The beach was the best beach we ever sawThe pool is great.The grounds are huge and maintained beautifully.Anything Mother Nature provided, the beach, the grounds, are kept spectacular. Anything else, the room and cleaning was disgusting. We will never stay here again.

<Content>Not Top Shelf, But Not the Bottom of the Barrel- Go and Enjoy I really did like the place,I had fun, except for a few little details they forgot to tell us.Never mentioned the tram car that has to take you every where you want to go..The place is to big !!The pool was fun and the swim up bar was great but they should take better care of it. The water wasn't as clean as it should be, and it needs a piant job. They should also invest in some new chairs...We up-graded the second day we were there, found you get better service, drinks, rooms, and a really nice dinner at Licey's...The food is below average, I've had better.The beach was great, water was wonderful. THe grounds are kept nice. We went to Captain Cooks for lunch and had a blast. Only go if you really like seafood, the food was fantastic, you will not walk away hungry, it's worth $60.00 per head. They take you over by boat, you get your lunch, drinks ( beer, wine,etc.) plus you can swim and shop right ther !! The entertainment was run of the mill, We went to Chopin's for dinner to see the piano player on the boat but was not told before we sat down that the boat was broken-No Show !!!All in all as vacations go it wasn't bad it could have been a lot worst. For the money you really can't beat it. It's not top shelf but it's not the bottom of the barrel !!! GO and ENJOY, WE DID !!!

<Content>Beautiful Grounds We had originally planned our vacation for the Mayan Riviera, but Mother nature had other plans (hurricane Dean). So the Bavaro Princess was a last minute and much more expensive alternative. We had two weeks of vacation but could only get the one week in the DR. We booked through Air Canada so were platinum guests which worked out really well. Our room was very nice, but no matter how much or how often we tipped our maid, she pretty much did what she felt like doing no more or no less. The food was mediocre, but really I didn't come here for fine dining. Tip for everyone..we booked dinner at $40US PP at the Cafe de Mer (seafood) and were sick for the remainder of the vacation due to food poisoning. Another couple also got sick at this restaurant. Just be very careful what you eat and how it is prepared. The Japanese restaurant was our favorite, thank goodness we ate there before the food poisoning. We had booked the outback safari excursion and unfortunately we were both so sick that there really was no enjoyment in this $80US PP. The beach is beautiful, unfortunately people seem to use the white sand as an ashtray there were ciggie butts everywhere, quite disgusting and I smoke.

<Content>Great Place Just returned from a family vacation to Bavaro Princess All Suites In Punta Cana. We had a great time and please don't believe all the negative reviews. We are a family of six and had three rooms booked. Our rooms were in the perfect location in villa #3 and we could even see the beach.We were able to walk to the pool, and beach everyday . This is a large resort and don't think I would have enjoyed a room farther away though. There is a tram that takes you around the resort and it was very accessible and never a problem getting one. The resort was full but we really didn't have a problem with getting chair around the pool or beach. Sure some people save them but there still was alot for us and even in the shade. The beach is beatuiful and what more can you say. I liked the way you could see the beach from the pool area . The pool is large and has a swim up bar. The food was just ok. I don't think the resort is a five star and would say it was a four star but we never went hungry. We did the steak restaurand one day and had a chuckle as we all ordered different things and got all the same. But we ate it anyway as we are on vacation and realize the language barrier. We really enjoyed the Choppin restaurant . This was a buffet but much better than the regular one in at the front. We ate breakfast and lunch at the bufett restaurant around the beach and they closed this at night for the steak restaurant. The show were just ok but we went everynight. The lobby is busy at night as this is were most people go in the evening. The front lobby is beatuiful. We only went out to the casino and across the street to some shopping one evening. The kids didn't really like the pushiness of the vendors and felt uneasy about that. The hotel had a vender night also one night and we liked that alot and they weren't that pushy. We went with apple tours and they had a special beach party for Apple one night on the beach and it was really nice. The rooms were good size and always clean. Our room did have a musty smell but you can expect that with the hot weather. One of the kids room did have a cockroach in it ( at least they told me that) they killed it and didn't have any trouble after that.We don't get nuts up about that.We had no trouble with bugs in our room at all. We got everything we asked for with king size bed for two room and two twins for the other room.This hotel is locataed on a nice part of the beach and is beside the paradisius and the occidental flammingo. I walked over to the occidential one day and it looked very nice also. We never were pestered with vendors at all at this resort as in previous trips. The only pestering we had was on the beach when you walked past they other resort and their time share people almost followed you in the water. My husband finally had to get a little mad and raise his voice to them.Would I go back to the Bavaro Princess ? Yes and no. I liked to see other resorts to find the perfect resort for me so liked to go to different resorts. Although this resort was probably the nicest we have ever stayed at and was very tropical looking. So go and have a good time. Just enjoy this country . The only trip we did was the kids went horseback riding one day for one hour and they liked that. We also did snorkeling one afternoon. I wouldn't do that again as there really wasn't much to see.

<Content>Hated the whole trip We went to the Dominican Republic for my nephews wedding. I thought I would have a great time and really looked forward to this vacation. Oh was I wrong. We arrived at the hotel after 3pm. We had 2 rooms booked, neither one of the rooms were ready. We had to wait over 1hour for our rooms. We had no where to change cloths because the hotel took our luggage when we arrived. That was the beginning of our nightmare. When we finally we able to get into our rooms, the smell of mold was horrible. The curtians had black mold on them. The shower had only water dripping out of the shower head and the water smelled like we showered in sewer water. One of our rooms toilet did not work for four days. We only stayed five days. Thank goodness our rooms were across from each other so we can use the other toilet. After finally getting settled and changed, we went to find dinner. The Dominican people on the resort were not friendly at all. They treated Americans very bad. I noticed if you did not speak spanish and were American you were treated like trash. Ever person I spoke to from America said the same thing. One couple I spoke to said that they have been to other resorts in the Dominican and were treated so much better. They rated this resort as a Zero. Our rep from VIP tours who was at the resort to help us, us very rude and was very unhelpfur to us. She was only avail if lucky 2 hours a day. Which as in the middle of the day. So you had to work your day around her schedule. Also she was never on time. My overall experience of the Dominican Republic is Terrible and I will never recommend anyone to go there for a vacation.

<Content>Interesting Vacation-A REAL Review Hello all,I stayed for ten days at the Bavaro Princess at Punta Cana. At first I must admit that I was quite scared because the reviews were not that great. However I found that when we got there check in was smooth and they even allowed us to check in prior to their 3oclock check in time. I was quite surprised to find that there is no air condition in the reception area nor in the restauraunt that we ate in The Hispaniola the food was very good and there was a great variety. I figured that was the only places that were not air conditioned and I liked the fact that there was this natural effect to the place. Shortly after we ate we were transferred to our rooms which had four twin size beds which was perfect for our family, since the two adults were not couples and so every one had their own bed. The air conditioner worked perfectly and at times was a bit too cold because the vents were facing directly on our beds, however after they were shifted in a different direction it was great. The first day we made reservation fr El Gaucho where the churasco was amazing nice and tender and well seasoned with vegetables, potatoes and yucca. It was very tasty. I realized that most reviews that stated that the food was awful were liars or just not accustomed to seasoned foods with good taste. I will strongly suggest that tast is all dependent on the individual. If you are used to eating a certain type of way then you might not like certain types of foods and you cannot complain because you are choosing to go to this vacation destination. At all times i also saw a pasta station available just in case. There are hamburers,, hot dogs, pizza as well for those who do not like ethnic foods like rice beans and meat. As far as getting sick, I did spend a lot of time in the bathroom but this can be attributed to drinking alcohol as well. The food itself did not cause me to be sick. I think anywehere you go the change in atmosphere, the sun, the pool, different foods, the nerves can cause one to be a little more apt to using the bathroom. Take alka seltzer, pepto bismol, immodium AD or whatever works and keep the party going. I took some alka seltzer and that was all I needed. I brushed my teeth with the water from the faucet and had no problems however they do provide a bottle of water by the sink to avoid any issues. One thing I did have a problem with was the service. Being that I have visited other places and the service has always been better than what I received. There are constant waitresses walking around picking up the dirty cups and cleaning ashtrays however at times it seems that asking them to get you a dring was not a part of their job. I do understand that they are tired because these people work very hard. You see them at night and early in the morning all over again. It seems that they do not sleep and they do work long hours and long days since most work eleven days consecutively and are off for three days. I suggest that you be patient and do tip them sicne they do not get paid that well. The entertainment was fun although at times it was daunting because they did a lot of dancing back to back. The location of your room is very important being that there is a trolley that takes you back and forth from the lobby to your room. If you are too far from the pool and the beach then you might have a problem getting a palapa in the shade because by 830 they are mostly held by other guests with their beach towels. Our room was closer to the pool than the lobby and we were comfortable. there is a nother pool by the lobby that is smaller and more private. I never went to that pool since I was closer to the main pool and the beach. My villa was 40. The club located inside the casino was never full only about fifteen people at one time. However the music was good and they played a variety of music. It was small but cozy. They provide transportation to a nearby discotheque called Areito in which the entrance is complimentary and you pay for your drinks. The music was good they play a lot of spanish music like salsa, merengue, reggaton. however if you are going to a spanish speaking country this should be expected. Some people just like to complain about everything. Just like I see some of the people complain about some of the workers not knowing English however there are French, Portugese, Italian people that go and deal with it. Again if you are in a Spanish country enjoying yourself make the best of it and get to know the basics at least. Oh I almost forgot the infamous trolley. Overall it was consecutive however when we were there two broke down and therefore they were often too packed for us to ride which meant long waits. Otherwise they were prompt. I just like being able to go where I want to go when I want to go so maybe a smaller resort would be better. its all about your preference and your attitude towards things.Overall my stay at this resort was pleasant, some workers were extremely corteous and therefore I made sure to tip them. I never tipped to get service, I made sure to tip if I received good service. You will enjoy yourself at this resort being that it is beautiful, the food was good, the entertainment was entertaining and the beach was spectacular. As far as excursions I recommend the the Saona Island and the buggy tour. This is not the best but it isn't the worst.

<Content>Amazing time at the Bavaro My boyfriend and I just got back from Punta Cana about a week ago....and we truly enjoyed our stay at the Bavaro Princess Resort  Spa. We were a little scared after having read some of the reviews here...but we were just amazed once we arrived. It was everything we hoped for and even more. It was our first time visiting the country, so we didn't really know what to expect. Thank God I studied Spanish for 6 years....that helped out A LOT (even though most employees there do speak some English). We booked through Apple Vacations and were very satisfied with their service from the very beginning. Arriving at the airport was a total culture shock (you have to see it for yourself), but you do have people there yelling Apple Apple to direct you to your bus which takes you to your resort. The whole process at the airport is kinda fast, but just go along with what everyone else is doing and you will be fine. In the bus, we had one of the Apple representatives gives us some do's and donts. He mentioned not to drink running water, how to say beer in Spanish (cervesa) and to try their local drink called Mamajuana (not Marijuana). :)Once we arrived at the resort, we had to wait about 30 minutes (which equals 60 Dominican Minutes---you'll hear about this) for our room to get ready. Once we got there, we were really pleased. The room was clean and spacious and that's all we asked for. Food: Do make dinner reservations to Sakura (chinese), Tanuki (japanese) and Gaucho (steak house). We really enjoyed all the food, especially the japanese!!!! Hispanola (the buffet restaurant at the lobby) was great. Yeah it took some time for our stomachs to get used to the food....but you really have a variety of things to choose from. The Gaucho is also open as a buffet for breakfast and lunch I believe and it is located at the beach. Pool: Thought it was great....lots of activities going on around there. A little too crowded at times but what can you do. Hint---if you get up a little earlier you can actually get a nice little hut or even one of the beds on the beach. But beware some people (crazy ones) get up at 5am to put their towels and reserve their spots on the pool/beach. Entertainment: Loved all the night shows....after the shows they usually have a little party around the lobby area where people dance bachata, merengue and salsa. The entertainers just grab you randomly...so be ready to dance (don't worry they will teach ya...super nice guys and girls). Excursions: If you are looking to do any excursions I would def. recommend the Outback Safari. I believe it is about $80 per person...but it is worth every penny. It is an all day excursion (9-4) where you go and explore the country side and actually see how people live and work on a daily bases. You get to see how people make coffee, coconut oil, sugar, chocolate and most importantly MAMAJUANA. I truly learned a lot on this little Safari Trip. The tour guides are amazing. We had a guy named Danny and we called him Danny Boy. He was very knowledgable and fun. At the end of the excursion you get to boogie board at the most beautiful island called PARADISE ISLAND. You really have to see this for yourself....I could not believe my eyes!!! The water so blue....so clear!!!Overall this was a vacation we will never forget. We miss it so much....and in fact are planning on staying at the Bavaro in the future!!! For those who book with Apple....get to know Carlos and Luis (Apple Respresentatives) real well....they are very helpful especially if you are looking to book an excursion. Oh yeah one last thing....we did find a huge bug in our bathroom the night before we were leaving....however, you have to remember it's ALL INCLUSIVE BABY!!! hahahahYou are on a tropical island and you have to realize that!!! And don't forget to ignore the Royal guys who try to get you to buy time share and property...they are everywhere!!!YO AMO PUNTA CANA!!!

<Content>Awesome Loved my trip to Punta Cana. Met some nice people - Jesse at the check in counter was very helpful and nice. Hector (tram driver) was very friendly - my children thought he looked like Derek Jeter (NYY MLB player). Juan the bartender at the beach was their favorite!! Monegro who worked with Juan was also very nice. Please tip them very hard - they work from 6 - 10 and get 3 days off every 11 days. The children loved the beach and the pool. The Funtastic group of entertainers were funny; especially Jose. They loved catching the lizards on the property and then setting them free. First time out of the country - would definitely return again.

<Content>Bed Bugs Bite This was a wonderful holiday for the children, but Mom and Dad suffered externally and internaly. Obviously the cotts brought in for the kids did not have an infestation, but our bed, room 778 left welts on our shoulders and my husbands neck. This was a platinum room but was not anything special. The realization of the bed bugs upon our return and a review of the welts, left us sick to our stomachs.The food was great for the kids, but as adult travellers we were disapointed by the a la carte resturants. It basically was cafetria food, served on a plate, no different, no better than what you got at the buffet. The only exception was at the Licey where you had to pay $30 US per person extra. The most infuriating issue was the lack of enforcement of towel policy. People would put their towels to secure cabana's/beech spots the night before. It was impossible to ever get a sun protection if you were honest or followed the rules.

<Content>Service a BIG problem My family and I have travelled throughout the Caribbean, but this was our first trip to DR. We chose this resort because it was a Special Deal from Air Canada Vacations. I had read the reviews of this hotel, but we decided that it was worth going (despite the reviews) because it was so inexpensive.Luckily we had the Platinum Package. This was absolutely worth it because we had a private lounge, free dinner to the Licey Restaurant, and we were very close to the beach. Also, the AC rep (Catherine) was often in this lounge, and she was extremely helpful if you needed anything.We had two rooms. Both rooms were quite big and clean, but they could use some sprucing up. The paint was yellow in spots, and the bathtub could use a refinishing (the enamel was chipped in spots). One room smelled nice, and the a/c worked well and silently. The other room's a/c was EXYREMELY noisy (ear plugs were needed to sleep at night), and the room always smelled musty. In both rooms the water pressure was better if you used lukewarm water, but quite low or non-existant on certain days if you went to warm (hot is not an option!) The food was good. We only went to the buffet one night. The a la carte restaurants varied in quality  taste, but overall were good. The Licey is excellent, as is El Pescador. Breakfast was good, and lunch was hit or miss. The biggest problem when it comes to the restaurants, whether sit-down or buffet, is the service. It is quite bad. At breakfast, we would have to ask the wait staff several times to bring us coffee. They would either ignore us or roll their eyes. Only after asking repeatedly would we get a cup. Forget about refills! It was slightly better at the main buffet, but the beach area buffet was terrible. In fact the worst service was always at the beach area restaurants. At the grill, people would be waiting for many minutes to place an order while the cook ignored the fact that people were standing there waiting to order a hamburger or hot dog. You would only get served if you just ordered want you wanted in a loud voice. Then he would pretend he hadn't seen you (or the other people standing at the counter). You need to be VERY careful with the hamburgers!! The person working the grill takes frozen patties from the freezer, and cooks them on a very hot grill. This results in the hamburger being burnt on the inside but raw inside. NOT HEALTHY TO EAT!The beach is gorgeous, but absolutely no service. No one comes around asking if you would like a drink (a mainstay in most resorts). If you would like a drink, you have to get up and order one. The bartenders at the beach area are not very polite, and if they think you don't speak Spanish they will insult you or call you names! Unbelievable behaviour!There are not enough beach umbrellas. Unless you get to the beach before 7am, you will not get one. I would not go back to this hotel. Although the beach is beautiful, I do not like feeling frustrated on holiday. The service REALLY needs to be improved. If I had paid full price for this hotel, I would have asked to be transfered to another hotel. There are no excuses for wait staff to ignore a client. The idea of wait staff rolling their eyes or insulting you is inexcusable.

<Content>Best vacation ever at Bavaro Princess, Punta Cana, Dom. Rep. Visited Bavaro Princess 8/11/07-8/16/07, The best vacation ever. Wonderful staff, however a great thanks for their hospitality and profesionalism to Gesconia (Housekeeping Spvr., Ada Santana (Housekeeper for my room), Mervin (Animator), Chapel, Animation Spvr.

<Content>Just what we were looking for! A girlfriend and I decided to get away so we booked a last minute trip to Bavaro Princess in July 2007. We are from Vancouver and booked the Air Canada Vacations through Flight Centre (note: FC matches any deals found online so we found a trip on selloffvacations.com and FC matched it!). The trip came to just over $1200...Booking the Air Canada Vacations trip means you are booking a Platinum Club package. The Platinum Club package was quite nice - if you have the option to upgrade you should do it! Firstly, there is a separate reception area, separate Platinum lounge with name brand booze, free internet etc., a massage appointment, a snorkel trip, meal in the 5 star restaurant, and the suites themselves were super nice. Big suites with a deck with two chairs a sitting area with tv, bed on second level etc. The Platinum package rooms are right by the beach. We were a few minutes away and it was great! RESORT: The resort is absolutely huge. There are trams that take you around to the various restaurants and lobby all the time but sometimes they are fully and you have to wait for the next one. There are lots of things to see at the resort. The bird house has a lot of birds including parrots, and an iguana house. Peacocks roam the grounds and there are flamingoes! The resort is clean and it never felt dirty. The pools are big and the beach itself has white and soft sand and there are a ton of palm tress. It just looks like paradise!ENTERTAINMENT/PARTYING: We noticed that this resort is for families and couples. Definitely not a party atmosphere, there is no club on site but there are clubs nearby and the staff will direct you there in the evening. There is a lot going on during the day - typical ping pong competitions, soccer, aerobics, and there is a show every night involving music and danging by the staff. As for clubs, we checked out Arieto a few times and Mangu Arieto has two parts, a salsa-latin music part and a house room. It was fun. Mangu was a whole different experience. it was packed and on the second floor there is some crazy stuff going on. Go-go dancers, a scantily clad man dancing on rollerblades, a 300+lb man dressed like a baby, a dancing midget. It was really crazy! If partying is what you want to do on your vacation, I'd say go to Cancun. The party scene there is way better...FOOD: Food was not that bad. I've been to Cancun and Cuba resorts and I would say that Bavaro princess had the best food out of the lot. There is a big buffet in the main lobby has a ton of different types of food and is open all the time. For dinner there are a number of restaurants that you need to reserve. - Bella Pasta - we went here twice. yummy pasta- Chopin -it's a buffet - nothing spectacular, there is a boat that circles the restaurant and this lady sings. i'd pass - Pescadore - seafood restaurant. pretty good.- Licey - the 5 star restaurant - the reservation was included with our Platinum package. It was ok but it was SO HOT in there that we couldn't really enjoy our food. It's supposedly air conditioned but not that night!- Drinks - not that great - I definitely wasn't drinking much during the day but the slushy drinks weren't really slushy and the pineapple juice wasn't real juice but some syrupy grossness. The cups are small and plastic - I haven't done it yet but I'd bring a bigger cup!OTHER STUFF:- It was quite busy when we were there. If we slept in (which was often) it was difficult to find a palapa (hut thing) which is necessary as it's really really hot out. I believe it says that you can't save seats by putting your towel on them, but I think people do - or they just get to the beach REALLY EARLY. We pulled an all nighter one night and saw people putting stuff down at 5:30 in the morning!! - there are a lot of topless ladies ... just a FYI- if you walk south on the beach there are a few markets so if you want to buy souvenirs I would definitely buy them there and not at the hotel. You can definitely bargain. We ended up buying magnets, and larimar jewelry at the marketPROS- beautiful gardens and lands- trams go around all the time, and even in the crazy early hours in the morning the security guard will call someone to drive you back to your suiteCONS- we checked in and were told that we couldn't get into our rooms for 3 hours. We had to carry our backpacks around, find some food, would really have preferred to be in our bathing suits and not fully clothed!- entertainment isn't that great - they have an animacion team but they're a bit pushy and try to make you participate. Friend and I got roped into being in the Miss Bavaro Princess competition and had to do sexy dances and sexy everything. AKWARD!- no hot water - I think we had hot water 1 day out of 7 - and the water pressure was terrible on hot - mind you this didn't bother us much since it was so hot out and a cold shower is great after a day at the beach!- the resort is really big and walking from the main lobby back to our suite by the beach would take foreverOVERALLWe had a great time. We just wanted to take it easy and go out a few nights and that's what we did. For $1200 we thought it was a deal - definitely get the Platinum package!

<Content>Wedding Problems I have been looking for a great site for a Punta Cana wedding for months. I finally picked the Bavaro Princess....but when it came down to it I couldn't book the wedding. I called numerous times and they said I can only book if I sent them an e-mail so I did and got no response!!! I had the date and a million invitations that needed to be sent out and warnings to guests that they need to get their passports. It all fell through. The hotel offered no help in booking the whole purpose for us to go down there. I have totally wasted months in trying to have the dream wedding me and my family and friends would want. The hotel itself had it all and all close by. It by far offered the perfect price, activities (more vast than most resorts), and spacey rooms. The wedding was a huge disappointment. Please be cautious. I still have yet to get married.

<Content>Size does matter The Negatives: Bigger isn't always better as this resort clearly demonstrates. Bavaro Princess is huge and when we were there (28 Jul - 11 Aug) it was fully booked. As a result service was hit and miss (in spite of generous tipping), the pool was constantly busy, palapas on the beach were difficult to obtain and during peak times hot water shower pressure was almost non-existent. The air-conditioning was barely adequate. The 鈥渟wimming鈥?pools aren鈥檛 really swimming pools but more like wading pools and totally inadequate to cope with a full house. Trying to get a drink at the swim up bar was difficult and very time consuming, a result of too many people, inadequate facilities and inadequate staff. As we arrived late on our first day, we ate our first evening meal at the main buffet (which we never repeated over the following 13 nights) not because the food was bad but because of the feeding frenzy and lack of courtesy exhibited by the diners. This leads me to my next point, one that you couldn鈥檛 blame the resort for 鈥?and that is the lack of decorum of some of the guests. There were guests who had no idea of what standing in a queue meant 鈥?they would barge a line as though others didn鈥檛 exist, they would pile food on their plates as if it was their last supper (and would leave half of it); there were people who would whistle and yell at the top of their voices across the room to get the attention of an acquaintance鈥n the restaurant by the beach, guests (old overweight men and women) would show up for their breakfast and lunch buffet in skimpy Speedos and bikinis with no cover 鈥?enough to put anyone off their food 鈥?and yet nothing was said or done about any of it. I have seen better mannered people with a sense of decorum in far more inexpensive resorts than this鈥?folks, this is most certainly not a five star. The Positives: Platinum Service: We travelled Air Canada, which gave us 鈥淧latinum鈥?Service, which given the overall 鈥渂usyness鈥?of the place, was well worth it. Platinum service allowed for a quick check in/out, quick reservations to all the restaurants not only at Bavaro Princess but also at the two adjoining sister properties (where the service was superb). The private lounch with drinks, TV, snacks and internet service was a plus.Restaurants: Other than the buffets, all the restaurants were good. Our favourites were the Japanese, Chopin, and Liccy. At the Punta Cana Princess we really enjoyed Le Fondue and IL Baccio. At the Caribe Princess, the local Dominican restaurant 鈥?can鈥檛 remember the name 鈥?was also very good. The service in the 鈥?鈥?star sister hotels was far better than at the 鈥?鈥?star Bavaro Princess.The Beach: Very nice beach but I had to be up early enough to ensure a decent front row palapa away from the madding crowd. Entertainment: Most of the shows were very good - some of the entertainers were brought in and were professional. No complaints here. Booze: Most times we got the premium brands (perhaps because I tipped and had the Platinum wrist band). I learnt to tip the same bar tender (and the same waitress) every night and that was the only way we were ensured quick service and only at the main bar/lobby. No complaints here. The Grounds: Superb with peacocks, ducks, birds, and flamingoes. Well looked after.Shuttle Service: Reasonably good for the amount of guests - got to where we had to get to when we had to get there. Overall Verdict: We enjoyed our stay but it would have been far better had there been less people or had the hotel had the staff and facilities to cope with their number of guests. I would give this resort a lukewarm recommendation...nonetheless, we had a nice and relaxing two weeks.

<Content>Liked the Bavaro Princess (Montreal) We were at the Bavaro Princess week of August 5. The beach was wonderful. We always managed to find a hut. The people are friendly.And since the grounds are large, they have a tram that was quite frequent and we never had to wait long. You just have to get used to the smell of exhaust (gas).Our bungalow was midway between the beach and the main hall. It is a 7 minute walk to the beach. A little more to get the the main hall but you get to pass through the small bird sanctuary which is very nice.The food at the buffet is okay and the 脿 la carte restaurants are all very good. We went to Chopin (deluxe buffet), the Bella Pasta, El Gaucho and the Japanese. We also enjoyed the evening buffets, especially the Mi Tierra night buffet.At the buffet restaurants, service is always a challenge. But that is what we made it out to be, a challenge. And instead of being annoyed and irritated, we were determined to get our red wine... and we did.We did not like the fact that the water sports centre is operated by a third party (Scuba Caribe). There are few kayaks and saw one pedalo which nobody ever took out because of the waves. We went snorkling by booking directly at the watersports centre for a 1 1/2 hour outing. They take you by motor boat to a reef (located in front of the Barcelo hotel). Unfortunately the guide was in a hurry and we snorkled for barely 40 minutes before returning. This was not worth our while at all. And all of the excursions we were interested in were very expensive.On the beach, many people get up early to reserve their hut and never end up showing up and we find this practice to be rude. We saw that the beach was cleaned daily and someone was always there to pick up garbage and glasses.When travelling outside the compound (to and from the airport) that there are lots of garbage everywhere.The room is quite nice, but is in need of some paint and thorough cleaning. Sheets were once dirty and face cloths are non existent. Air conditioning barely makes it but the outside temperature was so warm, you appreciate what you can get. We are relatively pleased with our trip. We did not get to snorkel to our satisfaction however. The vegetation in the DR is beautiful and green, especially compared to Cuba. The night that features the beach party is not to be missed.

<Content>LOVE!!!! If you're thinking about staying here...DO IT! Honestly this place is SO wonderful! Upon arrival(after a flight at stinking 4 am) we were greated with a wonderful smelling cool towel, and possibly some of the most refreshing beverages i've ever had in my life. It was a wait for us for our room which wasn't very fun because it is VERY humid there. However, once we got to our rooms it was wonderful. We turned down the a/c to 50 for the whole trip. It was awful when we were just sitting there watching tv, but when we came back from anywhere it was like heaven.The beach. Oh my, It is so amazing. I don't even think amazing is the right word. You do have to wake up early to get a cabana thing though. But the views early in the morning are so worth it, the sunrises are BEAUTIFUL! The sand is so perfect, no shells. And, there are NO jellyfish which is a huge deal to me. However, i woudln't really reccomend this facility if you're a conservitive family with impressionable children. There are many topless women and women in g-strings. Its their culture, so we just adjusted(we were all also adults). And if you are pale and of irish or scottish decent I advise bringing really high SPF. I'm pale and brought 45 thinking i'd be ok, and i got burnt to a crisp.Food:Oh this is my only real complaint. The food is so different from what we're used to as Americans that we can find it to be not cooked well. La Hispanola which is the buffett in the main lobby has breakfast. They have some wonderful american dishes there for breakfast. And feeding the birds afterwards is so fun. Also we ate there for dinner and lunch a few times, and it wasn't bad at ALL. Just stick to the american buffett if you're really picky or worried about safety. The seafood restaruant is good, if you pick the right thing. Go with the surf and turf...the turf is lobster and its WONDERFUL and the steak is perfect. Now there's a cesar salad i think? it has fish in it...they're wierd. And the steak place go for the argentine steak its SO good. Only drawback is there is NO steak knives at a steak place? And then there's Sakura...OMG this place is SO good. Everything is so tasty and just YUM! Eat there as much as you can LOL. Honestly there aren't a lot of bad things to say about this resort, the drinks, staff, and everything are wonderful. We got very friendly with the bartenders and by the end of the week we were adding our own alcohol to our drinks. So the watered down rumors, aren't true. Just ask for Mas rum and tip well! These people dont make a whole lot, and anything they appriciate. And we had plenty of water pressure at all times.Overall STAY HERE its worth every penny!

<Content>After 2 days we had enough. We spent in this hotel barely 2 days of weekend, taking voluntarily temporary assingement form our Occidental Flamenco Hotel due to overbooking. It was quite a disaster, we were so happy to leave Bavarro and return to Flamenco.The only good thing was a room. Clean spacious and bright, we had no problem accomodate in 4 ppl. One bed had broken leg, but they fixed it the very next day. AC working great, decent bathroom etc.Also, the beach was nice, finding palatas was relatively easy even in afternoon hours.And thats about the only positives we could say.Transportation sucks. This resort is spread on vast grounds, the trains seem to be always crowded, and finding seat during evening hours seemed impossible.The worst was food. The main buffet is open without AC, we did not enjoy eating while getting sweat at the same time. And food was bad, plain and tasteless. One evening it was all about oriental food, we noticed more ppl ended up @ american station taking hamburgers and hotdogs rather than oriental cuisine.And final nail was Chopin restaurant. Not sure why its called that, because its in fact an open buffet, with lots of seafood. While I am a seafood lover, after it i ended up with food poisoning for entire our remaining time in DR. And to tell the truth, after all iIwas not surprised, seeing flies and moths getting cozy in some salads.So after spending 2 days in bavarro, we could not wait to get back to Occidental Flamenco, where we enjoyed far superior quality and overall satisfaction.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation! I cannot wait to go back to Punta Cana!! My boyfriend and I were there July 18-21st celebrating his 30th birthday and had an amazing time. We went through Apple Vacations and were very pleased with our package. Although, I do wish we would have booked a whole week instead of only 4 nights! We decided not to upgrade to platinum and ended up happy with that decision. I LOVE the Dominican people, they were extremely friendly to us. In Chicago, no one says hello to you on the street unless they want something, I felt like these people were genuinely nice. I speak very little Spanish and could still communicate pretty well. One man climbed a tree and cut a coconut down for me to drink out of! It was really neat! Our room was clean and spacious. We weren't really concerned with the room, since we were outside almost all day. One morning I left a note asking for more towels and an extra pillow and by the time we came back that afternoon, it was all there. One good tip that I got from this site was to arrive with a few phrases already written out in Spanish (very helpful when I asked for the towels and pillow!) Our fridge was refilled everyday with more Coke, Sprite, and beer so there was no problem there. I didn't think the walking was that bad at all? I actually enjoyed it! The scenery was beautiful! We spent a lot of time on the beach and at the pool bar. The beach is absolutely gorgeous. We didn't have any problems getting drinks, we had more than enough!! We ate at the buffets quite a bit and always left full. I consider myself a picky eater and I always found plenty to eat. We only made reservations on two nights. We ate at El Guacho one night and had a great steak dinner. We also ate at Chopin one night and it was a lovely atmosphere. Neither one of us were sick while we were there, even though we came with lots of pepto and immodium just in case! We were very careful not to use any of the tap water. They give you plenty of bottled water so you can brush your teeth with that and not worry. We went on two excursions, the speed boat tour and the Saona Island trip. At first I wasn't all that excited with the speed boat idea, but my boyfriend really wanted to do that. It turned out to be such a fun day! You get to drive the 2 person speed boat for a while and then a bigger boat picks you up and takes you to a snorkeling site. It was awesome snorkeling! I have never seen such a beautiful coral reef and all the tropical fish were unbelievable! The Saono Island was a lot of fun too. First, you are taken out on a speed boat to a natural swimming pool in the middle of the ocean where you can see huge starfish. Then they take you to the island and you have a couple of hours to shop and eat lunch. They prepare an island bbq for you and it was really good. They also had some dancers and a couple of bars (this is all still included in your package, I couldn't believe it.) Then it's basically a booze cruise back. They play music and there is drinking and dancing. I felt like the excursion were a really good way to meet other people from the different resorts. The speed boat tour was about $60/person and the Saona was about $80/person. I felt like both were worth the money. I tipped the housekeeping staff with cash and souviners from Chicago and they seemed very gracious. I also brought little things for kids like school supplies and hair bows. If you go on the excursions you really see how poor the country is. We tipped the bartenders every few drinks and thought that it was fine. Be careful with the mamajuana! Although, try a shot of it with coffee, it was pretty tasty, I would have never guessed! Overall, we just had a great time! Feel free to email me with any questions!

<Content>Honeymoon gone Bad We went to the Bavaro Princess Resort for our Honeymoon. We got there on July 30 through August 4th I hated every day and couldn't wait to come home. Our trip started out bad and kept getting worse. We got into the Dominican Republic airport 2 1/2 hours late after sitting at the PHL airport for way too long. We meet our transportation which was this mini van who took us to the hotel with only us in the vehicle and a spanish speaking driver. The worse thing about this hotel is that ever one speaks spanish and very little English. The entertainment is all in spanish the music is in spanish. The service is terrible and trying to communicate with anybody is impossible. We purchased a honeymoon suite w/jaccuzzi. Arriving to the hotel they stated that they have no suites with jaccuzzi and gave us a room near the beach. I could care less that I was near the beach. I absolutly hated this resort I am so disappointed in my travel agencies and the VIP services who did absolutely nothing for us while we were there.

<Content>never again My husband and I just came back from Bavaro Princess last Saturday. It was all we could do to get out of that hotel. We even paid extra just to get home early. This vacation was one of the biggest disappointments ever. I wish I had read the postings on this website before we booked our vacation. Although from the appearance of our room it looked liked it was very nice. Just wait until the middle of the night when the cockroaches come out. It got to the point where I made my husband go on bug duty before I could even use the bathroom. We saw several roaches scurrying for cover when we turned on the lights in the bathroom in the evenings. Some mornings we would even find dead roaches lying on the floor in the main room....YUCK! Both of us would wake in the morning with bites on our legs, backs, and sides we're sure there must have been bed bugs. Service at this hotel is almost non-existent. Although we were only the 4th couple in line we waited over an hour to check in. While dining in the restaurants we were lucky if we could even get our water glasses filled. The food in the restaurants was mediocre at best. Not sure if I got a touch of a bug from the food or just an upset stomach. The Japanese restaurant however, was VERY good. The beach was beautiful. Be warned though...if you are sitting under a palm tree or a tiki hut you will most likely encounter spiders crawling on you while you rest. This would probably happen at any beach though. The non-motorized water activity stand that was supposed to be included required a deposit for any equipment you wanted to use. Sure it was only a deposit but the whole point of the all-inclusive is that you don't need to carry any money with you. Also fellow guests were VERY rude at the beach. The days we went to the beach we arrived between 8:30 Am and 9:00 Am the beach itself was practically empty however people had come by and placed their belongings on the prime real estate lounge chairs then don't come back until 11 or 12. This is not fair to the people like us who are there at the beach to actually use the chairs. Although hotel policy states that unattended belongings left on chairs for more than 30 minutes will be removed this does not happen and we had even gotten into an argument with a couple after we had been accused of stealing their chairs although we had been sitting in them for 90 minutes already. The pool seems to have the same situation regarding chairs although we did not spend much time at the pool. One evening as we left the seafood restaurant we looked at the empty pool floating in one end was vomit, noodles actually floating in the water. The pool was already closed for the evening at this point and maintenance crews were adding the chemicals. Why they weren't removing the vomit I don't know. Also, on Tuesday a baby snake had fallen from the grass roof above the swim up bar into the pool. I hate snakes. These two incidents were enough to keep us out of the pool. Finally, the worst part of our vacation. My husband developed a large red spot on his forehead during our second full day. We initially thought this was some sort of spider bite as we had fallen asleep on the beach. As the days passed it grew larger and larger finally on Thursday night we decided we needed to get home so he could have it looked at by a doctor back in the US. We messed around with the apple reps for so long on Friday morning that we weren't able to make any of the flights out that day. We finally said fine put us on the first flight back to the US on Saturday morning, we don't care what city it flies into we'll figure out how to get home from there on our own. We were told that flight had 3 seats available. We said great we'll take that flight only to be told we could not be guaranteed this flight we would have to go stand-by! In the end it worked out and we did get on the first flight out Saturday morning. After a long day of traveling on Saturday my husband decided to take some Benedryl for the bite on his head Saturday night and get to the ER first thing Sunday morning. Sunday morning the swelling on his forehead had spread and he could barely open his right eye. When he got to the ER the doctor told him that it was not a bite after all, instead he had contracted some sort of infection. We still don't know what it is whether it is viral or bacterial he is on antibiotics for both for the next 7 days. We are uncertain for sure on how this infection was contracted but we do have a guess. When we were at the beach on Monday, our first full day we were approached by the hotel photographers to have our picture taken with their monkey. We thought it would be a cute picture. It was a cute picture we actually bought a copy from the hotel that evening. However, it seems very likely that as the monkey moved from sitting on my husbands shoulder up to sit on the top of his head the monkey may have inadvertently scratched him on the forehead thus contracting the infection. Be warned to stay away from any animals while in a foreign country you never know how well they are taken care of in terms of illnesses.

<Content>Good to Bad to HORRIBLE.. NEVER AGAIN OK soo my boyfriend, 22, and I, 20, just got back from a weeks stay at Bavaro Princess. Prior to going I have been reading all the good and bad reviews and I felt like I kinda new what to expect. So getting to PUJ airport was kind of a breeze. We didnt have to wait very long, we just stood in line paid the 10$ went to find our luggage and found our tour Bus which was VIP tours the guys in the yellow shirts. When we were dropped off at our hotel a man told us to go check in and he would meet us later at our room but we couldnt take our luggage. SO i was a little uspet that I was leaving all my belongings in the hands of this guy. So we took a tram to our room, 277, and went in and liked what we saw. The room felt pretty cool and seemed to be decently cleaned. Our luggage took about 20 min to get to us, we unpacked, and went to the lobby to get some food from the buffet. The food was not so bad to me the first day. Then we got some drinks at the lobby bar and sat outside where the fountain was, sipping our Mai Tais and feeling the cool breeze. First day was great. Second and Third day werent bad either we went to the beach where they play music and got everyone up and dancing, then the pool where we enjoyed the pool bar (it does take a while to get a drink) ,we drank alot of drinks ( my favorite was the icee and blue coraco called a Blue Jay), and ate at the buffet and Mc Princess where the have burgers, hotdogs, and french fries. The fries were good but the burgers were blah. The buffet started to get worst for us though. It became harder to find foods that I thought were good to eat and safe to eat. The pizza is not good, burgers no, the fruit is gross, meat is sketchy. Some good food was the Fried Chix and the potatoes and rice. The second night they had dancing in the lobby with their house band and third night they had the beach party.It was fun but after that there wasnt much to do. We went to the casino 4 times during our stay and spent alot of money there playing the slots and tables but we also won some which was fun and the drinks are better at the casino and only cost a dollar or two. The food- Every morning they have the same buffet, Omlet station which was good, potatoes, beans, bacon (good), crossoints and rolls, and more eggs. It was hard for me because I dont like eggs so I ate potatoes and bacon every morning. The a la carte restaraunt were good. El Gaucho- Ok- we got the argentinean steak Bella Pasta- Good- we got the Chix Parm with Pasta but the Tiramasu was inedible.Chopin - Our favorite- had a buffet but it was alot to choose from and very good along with the boat ride that has a piano and a singer riding around the lagoon that the restaurant is in. Sakura- HATED DO not go there. I got the Sweet and Sour Pork and my bofriend got the Pork Ribs- We were sick for the night and next day. Ironically since we were sick the next day we didnt make reservations for anywhere else and went to the buffet which was ORIENTAL themed night HAHA on us. We never made it to El pescador or Licey becuase if you didnt get there by 8- 830am everything was full. Dominican night was fun. They had music and vendors come out to sell like in a flea market and they had Dominican Style buffet. The beach- Was beautiful with topless woman ( my boyfriend enjoyed) we found a quieter bad down the way with more available huts and it was easier to get a drink The excursion- HAHA we took the speedboat excursion which you get to drive your own speedboat and go snorkeling. It was a mess.at first they didnt have enough life jackets, then no one spoke english so they couldnt tell us how to operate it. I drove accidently and nearly cried. We broke down and had to be left behind while they dumped water out of our boat then told us to follow them. they sped away and all I could see was their orange jackets. We used snorkeling equpiment that was still wet from the time used before so I dont think they cleaned it. Snorkeling was fun but after 10 min we saw the same thing. Driving back we got another bad boat and had to be moved to another boat. My boyfriend had fun driving it. I almost cried and was very upset at how unorganized it all was. But were not in the US anymore so I guess I shouldnt complain. I would never do it again thoSo any way after the thrid day I woke up with a HUGE rash going across my upper back and down my arms, inbetween my legs and my ankles. I am someone who has very sensatvie skin so I just thought I had an allergic reaction to something and decided it was nothing else. UNTIL my boyfriend got the same rash on his legs a night or two later. Then we realized how itchy we were everytime we layed in bed. We also saw a smear of what looked like was blood on my pillowcase. after we experienced this for a few days we realized what we were dealing with. BED BUGS! and it was until the last night that we realized so we didnt sleep in the bed we slept on the couch and a lil chair covering up with bath towels. It was horrible and right now im still dealing with the irritation and now there are spots on my body that I will be seeking medical attention for because I dont know what they are. On our way home we talked to a man from another resort who had the same problem. I am so disgusted by this and I wish there was something I could do but I cant. Now Im just hoping that these spots arnt anything serious. I will never go back to Dominican Republic. If anything just take a cruise there, see it for the day and get back on the beautiful boat and LEAVE IT. The airport leaving was a mess to- we got in a line that took a half hour to get to the front, had our bags checked and then were told to get in this other HUGE line that took an hour and half just to get our tickets and boarding pass. Then we had to go through immigrations and find our gate. Well I would call this the pit area because there was no order. our ticket said gate 4 but we found out it was really gate 2. agind in Charlotte the tickets they gave us said gate 14 when it was 11. It is so hot in the airport and we smelled so bad. lol I will not be going back

<Content>4th and last time! Last week I stayed at this resort, party of 2. We had platinum service. This was my 4th visit in 3 years to this resort, all of which were either Platinum, or the previous VIP program.The Vacation was through AC Vacations, and the flight down from Toronto was excellent. We were bumped up to Business Class for free at the gate, and the flight was on time.We arrived at the resort at around 11am, and after waiting for one of the golf carts that ferries guests around for 10 minutes in order to go check in at the platinum lounge, we have up and walked to it -- since we are familiar with the resort. When we got to the lounge, we were the first to check in from our arriving group, suggesting the golf cart transportation had still not arrived. Perhaps not suprisingly, our room wouldn't be ready until 3PM, the stated check in time. That's fine...we just went to lunch and waited around. When we went back at 3, they told up 3:30. More waiting, and more waiting ensued until 4:30, when we were given our room. Why wasn't my room ready? Well, my room wasn't ready because the guest in there before just didn't check out. I was comforted by the desk agent by him telling me that they had charged the guest $40 dollars for our inconvenience. Of course, we weren't given the $40 bucks, or really anything for that matter other than shrugged shoulders.The room was ideally situated, close to the pool, beach and lounge...but the A/C hardly worked, and the water pressure all week was terrible. We got fed up with the A/C on the second day, and they moved us up to an Ocean view suite which also had bad A/C, no water pressure, no hot water except at times that you don't need it (like 2PM). I complained a few times, but eventually gave up -- not worth the effort, as the management was pretty apathetic.We met two other couples who had the same problems in Platinum. In fact, one couple was given a non-platinum suite and the only compensation offered was an extra 20 min massage...and that was after a lot of effort going through the AC Vacations rep.Food: The only things I had all week that were good was Steak at El Gaucho, Pasta at the pasta station in the Hispaniola buffet, and boiled eggs by the beach in the morning. My partner actually picked up some rotten pineapple at one of the buffets, which was less than appetizing to her. The food here has REALLY went downhill. The worst was El Pescador, the fish restaurant. Everything was cold, and tasted bad. Luckily, a guest services manager was hovering around in that restaurant and intercepted me as I was leaving. This was the ONLY positive experience I had with management, as she apologized and immediately had us seated at El Gaucho. This resort needs more of that kind of management.Beach: Excellent, although many of the chaise loungers were broken. Sea was just marvelous.Pool: Dirty. It was painted white, and you could see yellow slime on the sides of the pool. Otherwise, the pool was good. The pool bar was often understaffed -- one guy trying his darnedest to serve a full bar of people. A couple of the days they put 2 guys on and it was better.Casino: That was OK, had fun at $10 Blackjack, but the A/C there was a bit weak too.Excursions: (This has nothing to do with the Hotel, by the way) We did the Saona excursion, and it was bad. It is a long bus ride, then you go out on speed boats...which was very fun. They take you to a natural pool in the ocean and feed you drinks, then back into the boat for a ride over to Saona, which is supposedly an unspoiled beach. What we got was an unspoiled beach that was set up with relentless dominican craft vendors, where we had to spend 3 hours. After that, we had a wonderful sail for 1.5 hrs in a tropical storm, then a bus ride to Punta Cana with a stop in Higuey -- actually, they dumped us at a tourist place where we could buy rum and paintings at american prices.The highlight of the trip was coming home. From now on, my home in the D.R. will be the Paradisus Palma Real where we went at Christmas. It is more expensive, but at the same time you do get something for your money.

<Content>Enjoyed it. Came back from Bavaro Princess Resort on August 9th. I must say that nine of us went, including children, youngest being 2yrs old, and we did not have any problems at this resort.Room was great, AC worked great, water pressure was great, hot water was great, pool and beach was great, food was great, none of us got sick from the food. We had breakfast and lunch at the buffet, and dinner, we had at the restaurants, and it was good.This is a beautiful resort, with wonderful friendly people who work very hard. I will go back. Shows at night time were really good, i enjoyed all of them. Beautiful, beautiful resort.

<Content>No to Bavaro Princess The gorunds are way to large. You must take a tram car to get around. Sometimes, depending on the time, we had to wait 30 minutes to get a tram because the ones that came by were full.  The AIR CONDITIONING IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH NO RELIEF IN SIGHT. We had no air for 2 days and this is with many calls to have it fixed. Two men finally came to our room at 7:00PM to look at it. We went to dinner and returned at 11:00PM to find half of the drop ceiling taken down, a ladder in the ceiling where the unit was located, tools all over the floor, a hose from the unit to the toilet in the bathroom, long pieces of metal hanging from the ceiling and no one there to tell me whats going on. A call to the front desk informed me that that there was a report that someone was there. No kidding! Are they coming back tonight or what ?. After asking for either a supervisor, the repair men to come back, or move me to another room, the only wat to get some type of respose was a threat to take pictures and post them on every travel website i could find! Finally the repair men came back and replaced the compressor and left at 12:40AM. If this was so involved, this work should have been done during the day, not at midnight. Service at this resort is almost non existing. The shower curtain rod came out of the wall and that took 2 days to get re-hung. I had to make a chain with the plastic clips that hold the shower curtain to the rod, with the shower curtain and clip the two ends of the chain to the towel racks. I felt like I was CAMPING. The last night we were there, my daughter found hundreds of little ants in her bed. We had to put the bed outside on the balcony.  It seems like the more you asked for services the slower the response was. Some of the staff were great (Ceasar at the pool and Ruben at the swim up bar in the pool), others had the attitude like- too bad, what are you going to do, leave. Believe me, I couldn't wait to leave. I will never go back to this resort even if it were for free and I think I speak for many of thr other guests that I had spoken to.

<Content>Just OK It was nice but not great. Our first room in the hotel room (JR Suite) area at the front of the resort was terrible. We couldn't change rooms until the next day due to the hotel being full. Here are some of the problems with our first room-the toilet won't stop running, the tub was so dirty looking, the phone didn't work (the wires were hanging out of the wall), two lights didn't work etc. The next day we upgraded to a Suite in the bungalows. It was nice but it was aging. This was my 3rd time to DR and my husband's 5th and I think our last for awhile. We've done a lot of travelling and I just wasn't loving DR this time. The beach is beautiful and the food was ok. For the price you pay DR is a fair value but this resort is not a 5 star!

<Content>The Bavaro Princess Gets An "A" I just returned from a week at the Bavaro Princess. My husband and I took our 17 and 24 year old sons. We booked two rooms and ended up in Building #65. This was a good location (next to the mangrove which is as close to the center of the resort as you can get). We booked our vacation through Apple Tours. This ended up being a good move since the Apple reps are right at the hotel, and they speak fluent English. They helped us book safe excursions (telling us NOT to try the banana boats as the natives like to flip Americans - - some have been injured).Pluses: beach, hotel grounds; food (ALWAYS something to eat -- many choices-- try the homemade donuts for breakfast and the orange juice); peacocks, swans and chickens roaming the grounds in the early AM; clean rooms with hot water and no bugs; maid service; friendly staff; a great cultural experience for those Americans who are patient and do not have to be waited on every minute of the day; Tanuki Restaurant (new-- Japanese Hibachi), El Gaucho Restaurant (great steak)Deltas: low water pressure on some days (being well people, this was really no big deal for us); the seafood (strange varieties of fish prepared in unusual ways - - if you want to try seafood, go to Maryland, Virginia, etc); the casino; very little to do in the evening (you may want to do late dinners)Points to Ponder: 1)When you have a question or need something, go to the information desk in the lobby. Don't try and ask the maid or other workers. You will just get frustrated since they speak very little English. 2)Don't drink too much or eat too much. These are the people who get sick. Just remember that you can always eat and drink more tomorrow! 3) The butter has no salt in it, so it will taste odd. Add a little salt, and you will be fine. 4) The availability of mixed salad dressings will be hit-or-miss. Bottles of oil and vinegar are always available. 5)The shows are interesting, but they are in Spanish. 6) Packets of Heinz ketchup were available at McPrincess (grill on the beach) every day. 7) If you venture to the shops at the entrance of the resort, don't go by yourself and don't go at night. It can be a scary place. 8) If you want a palm umbrella closest to the water, you will need to mark your spot around 6:00 a.m. I arrived at the beach around 7:30 a.m. one day. I was still able to get an umbrella, but I was several rows back from the water. 9) Learn a few words of Spanish (i.e. please, thank you, stop, coffee, water, etc).Someone mentioned difficulty in getting drinks in the buffet restaurants. This can be hard. I asked my Apple rep about it, and he said that you need to just raise your hand when you need something. We did this and were always waited on. It feels funny doing that, when you see that others seem to get drinks without raising a hand. The workers know you speak English, and that makes them uncomfortable since their English is not good. Just raise your hand from the beginning, and you will not be frustrated.Punta Cana reminds me of Riviera Maya in Mexico. It can be a great vacation if you go into it with the right frame of mind!

<Content>Never again I got back yesterday after spending a week at the bavaro princess.This trip was a big disappointment. First of all, we had no hot water for 3 days. Not so bad for me to take a cold shower, but terrible for my 5 yr old daughter. the water pressure is terrible too. Food was pretty bad and I was sick just about everyday. Staff was rude and it was VERY hard to find anyone that spoke much English at all. I sometimes got the feeling that they understood what i was saying but chose to play dumb! The Disco opens at 12 and closes at 2 which is ridiculous. Most of the young people were going to a club in the hotel next door. Also not much for the little ones to do. They have a kids club but with limited hours and limited activities. The game room for older kids is a joke. it is a tiny room with a couple of pool tables in it. not very inviting. The resort is huge. You have to take a trolley everywhere and it can be hard to find one depending on the time of day. Luckily I was a platinum guest and my room was near the beach and pool as well as one of the buffets. I feel sorry for anyone getting stuck in one of the rooms in the hotel. it is basically at the enterance to the resort and near nothing! I would not reccomend this resort to any one and would never go back. if you are looking for a nice, big all inclusive resort that is inexpensive, try Moon Palace in Mexico near cancun. I had a much better experience there. There is always food and drink around the pool, the people are nice and it is a pleasant experience. At the Princess, no one comes around taking drink orders atthe pool. And the drinks are the pits! They do not have cranberry juice for some reason. That was a real pain since almost all the drinks i wanted required Cranberry Juice! The only good thing i can say about the Princess is that the beach is beatiful and they do keep the grounds nice. Mexicos beaches are a little rough. All in all, stay away from this hotel. it just isnt worth it!! 5 stars it is NOT. Not even close!!!

<Content>Beautiful resort My experience was good and bad. Bavaro Princess was beautiful, grounds well kept. Beach was beautful. Problem with communication, however, they tried very hard. Carlos with Apple Vacation was witty, knowledgeable, and very helpful through out our stay. One thing we were not told, and made a difference since one of our members was on insulin, and needed it refrigerated. The key card they give you when you go to your room needs to remain in their slot 24 hrs. We had no lights, no refrigeration due to lack of explaining this to us. It was quickly resolved with a call to the front desk. We had a problem with the air conditioning unit leaking into the hallway, the floors are all tiled, and one of our ladies took a fall on the wet floor in the midddle of the night. We also had another member who went to turn on a light over the bed suffer a shock up her arm due to the lamp shorting out. This issue was also quickly resolved. We had no problem with getting drinks anywhere. We did however tip the staff who assisted with our room, drinks, restaurant, casino etc. Our service was excellent. They actually came more than one time a day and restocked refrigerator, towels, soap, shampoo, coffee etc. Plenty of bottles of water. Beds were made up each day and turned down each night, with flowers leftthrough out the room. We took an excursion, and these people drive like they are crazy. It is their way of life however, and we laughed as much as we cringed. I was not impressed with the entertainment, although you had to give them credit for trying.Their pools were awesome. Staff friendly. Trams drove like a bat out of h- - -. If you get your hair braided think twice before having it done all over, especially if not on the beach resort.I had a reaction to the wax or whatever they put on your hair and had to go to the ER when we got off of the plane. I was put on 5 different medications and it took at least two weeks, hospital and doctor visit before cleared. As I said good and bad. Overall, I would recommend the Princess Bavaro not as a 5 as Apple states but at least a 4. I do not plan on traveling outside of the U.S. for years to come, but it was an experience I'm glad we had.

<Content>Wonderful Resort Just returned from Bavaro Princess and was very pleased with the resort as a whole. The room was well kept and very spacious. We had maid service twice a day. The 96 acres of land was beautifully manicured. Eating was a treat. You not only had buffets in the lobby but also breakfast and lunch buffet on the beach. Each sit down restaurant was unique in its menu and all had wonderful service. The beach had small rolling waves as well as worthwhile snorkeling but only near the safety line. We cannot say much about the nighly entertainment as we did not see any of the shows. We were too worn out from the daily activities.If you can book through apple vacations, Carlos helped us at the resort to book side trips and also helped book our reservations at the individual restauarants. We had heard that all the food at the different restaurants was the same as the buffetts. It was not. The quality of preparation, presentation, and atmosphere was superior at the individual restaurants.The tours we booked were to Santa Domingo and snorkeling at the marinarium. Both were worthwhile. Santa Domingo for history and snorkeling for swimming with the sharks and stingrays.The staff of the resort was friendly and helpful but spoke mostly Spanish. Sesame Street spanish will get you a long way.Don't drink the water and you will have a great time.We drank and ate at the resort and were healthy.

<Content>Best Vacation Ever First of all I have read all the comments other people have wrote about this resort, and I don't think they stayed at the same place I did. We had a group of three adults and had the best vacation of all of our lives. The only problem, I don't speak Spanish very well, but didn't prove to be that big of a problem. We definately drank plenty. Whoever said they wouldn't give her must have been unfriendly. We usually drank at least 3 bottles of wine with each dinner. The staff here were great, if you take five minutes to talk to them you get great service. Our waiters always wanted to know where our next reservation was so they could take care of us. We also took the time to find out where they would be. We would go to breakfast and Dominigo would have our favorite breakfast drinks at a great table before we finished getting our food. Same with lunch. Don't be fooled by the negative comments. This is definately the one place you will have a GREAT vacation.

<Content>Take it easy people, this is vacation! We just returned from Bavaro Princess - from a week-long WONDERFUL vacation. We are a couple, both 26, looking for a place to relax and have a good time.I would like start this off by saying that everything you read about the service is NOT true. The staff was great and worked hard. This goes for bartenders, cooks, waiters and especially the entertainment staff. During the week we were there the place was sold out - as you can imagine, the buffet was busy at dinner, yet we still managed to eat and drink as much as we wanted. As far as drinks 鈥?there are more bars in this place than one knows what to do with. You hardly ever had to wait to get served (even though it was filled to capacity). Most places we go we bring our own large cups 鈥?there was no need to do this as there was a bar close by where ever you were (including 3 on the beach!). You really can鈥檛 go wrong! The pool bar staff was amazing and treated us well every day! Also, we wrote a little note in Spanish (as best as we could) to our maid on the first day asking her to give us 4 beers everyday instead of 2. Sure enough, that was done for the remainder of our trip. Really, no complaints about service!We did need to change our room because we were not given a king bed 鈥?when we arrived the first night (we hade a late flight so it was around 11pm), we phoned to reception and made our request. We were told that they could accommodate this the next day and surly enough, the next day at 3pm a bell boy came to pick up our bags and take us to our new room. Be nice to people and they will be nice back. Isn鈥檛 this a universal principle 鈥?why should it be any different in the Dominican? The 2nd room was mustier than the first 鈥?this was due to the setting we kept our air conditioner on (recommended is 80, but we preferred to deal with a little mustiness and keep the room at a cool 65). Now, the resort is larger than most, and I would not recommended it for people that have difficulty walking or have small children. That being said, all the people that do not fall into the elderly or infant-carrying category have no reason to complain! None at all!!! We were located in the middle of the resort 鈥?a short walk to the beach/pool and a short walk to the main building. 5 minutes at most. How lazy have we become that we can鈥檛 walk for a few minutes through these absolutely beautiful grounds prior to lying down on the beach or stuffing our faces at the buffet? Common people, let鈥檚 get real.One other topic important to address is the absolute lack of bugs! We did not see even 1 bug (mosquito, ant, nothing!). Having gone to Cuba this time last year we were expecting to be eaten alive again and came prepared with enough Off bug spray to cover an army. However, there was no need at any time during the day or night.One other person addressed the TV issue. We agree. It is nice to be able to lie in bed before dinner or at the end of the night and watch tv. The set up of the room does not allow this. But again, just a little creativity will solve this 鈥?we moved the dresser the tv was on so that it was closer and in plain view of the bed. The maids did not mind and we kept it like this the whole week. See, the only problem was easily resolved. On the water pressure issue 鈥?I have long hair and usually showered before dinner (peak time). I enjoying my showers and had no problem washing out the shampoo from my hair. Enough said.I鈥檓 not even going to spend time talking about the beach 鈥?it is breathtaking!We definitely recommend this resort and will go back next time we visit Punta Cana. I hate to see beautiful resorts get a bad reputation because some people go down with the intention of complaining over everything. This is vacation鈥?take it easy!

<Content>Bavaro Princess Beautiful great service I went to the Dominican is August of 05. It has to be the most beautiful place I have ever been. The people are very friendly as long as you try to understand everyone who is from there because not everyone speaks english well. This is understandable since it is a primarily spanish speaking country. I had exceptional service at the bavaro princess hotel and I found it to also be very beautiful and clean. The food was really good but definatley different but really good. Definatly drink bottled water though. You dont want to get sick from the water. The beaches were amazing and it is an absoute paridise. Iam going back probably this year I loved it so much.

<Content>Bittersweet resort Just got back from a week spent at the Bavaro Princess. Alot of people may seem to post only negative things about this resort. I agree with most of them, but this resort did have some good points as well. Let me just say, however, that I would not recommend this resort. I have stayed in Punta Cana twice before, once at the Grand Palladium, and once at Iberostar Punta Cana, both of which were much, much nicer that the Bavaro Princess. Here goes:Check-in:Not bad. As usual, we got there about 11 a.m., and no rooms until 3 p.m. I've just gotten used to this I guess.Rooms:First of all, I must mention that we did have a traveler with us that needed handicapped assistance, such as a handicapped room. This resort did not offer handicapped rooms, though, when we booked, Apple Vacations did say that they had handicapped rooms. Not the case! One step into room, two steps up to bed, two steps down to bathroom, and no handicapped shower. Rooms were musty, but, hey, you are in the jungle. The air-conditioning does not work well. Maid service was decent and the room was always clean.Bugs:Take Off or Cutter or some sort of insect repellant. I won't say any more!Beach/Pools:Gorgeous!Food:Out of the 3 resorts I've stayed at in Punta Cana, Bavaro Princess had the best food! Lots of selection. Beverages:All domestic liquor. Beer OK. Just a side note... Iberostar offers imported liquor...Tanqueray, Beefeater, Canadian Club, Bacardi, Absolut, etc. Alcoholic beverages weren't bad at Princess, but I've had better at other resorts.Resort in general:Very, very large, though the tram does make frequent stops at all destinations, and is easy to pick up.Casino:Not Las Vegas, but fun. Play the Big Ben machines.So, I hope this helps... If you have any questions, please feel free to email me.

<Content>Beautiful but beware!!! Ok , so I am not picky at all. I can pretty much have fun anywere But when the food and drink made all of our party of 6 ill, it pretty much destroyed our vacation!! So here are some more details:The grounds are beautiful, the best beach I have ever seen. Also JC in activities is awesome!! So is Rueben at the pool bar!! The fun we did have on our trip was because of them!!The beer is ok, but WATCH, the beer is not all Presidente. Even the help told us they serve a cheaper beer in some of the bars trying to make it seem as if you are drinking Presidente. But this beer is disgusting!! The mixed drinks were not very good also. Previous resorts I have been to made the drinks with fresh fruit and they were made to order, not out of a slush machine. The food- we were all up to trying new things but we all paid for it. I am not talking a little sick I am talking vomiting/diarrhea/in bed two days sick with upset stomachs still after we got home. The room was ok, our bathtub was rusty and the outside of it was peeling off but we were within walking distance to the beach so we didn't complain.The servers in the reserved restaurants were awful, they never offered you anything but water. Like another review said I have never drank so little on a vacation!!I do want to say all the staff that works the beach/pool during the day is awesome, we did tip them several times through our trip.Won't go back, EVER!!!!

<Content>Returning to the Bavaro Princess Stayed at the Bavaro Sept of 06. Was hesitant booking after reading reviews. We were a party of 4 adults, our rooms were behind the wedding gazebo at the beach. Nothing negative to say about the resort. A/c fine, after all we don't go to the tropics to stay inside a room. The suites were fantistic and we have traveled all over. We did go platinum which I think is great. You get checked in at your own private lobby. We had no language barrier and do not speak Spanish. The people really try to speak English. We went prepared to do alot of tipping. We tipped everyone and took dollar store items to give the maid along with a tip. No bug problem, no water pressure problem. The suites are immaculate. Beach is one of the prettiest we have been to. Americans are the minority, so if you are narrowed minded this may not be the place for you. We did brush our teeth using the bottled water, made coffee the same way. No one got sick. Food was plentiful, everyone can find something to eat. Stayed on the beach about 8 hours a day. Take insulated cups for drinks. After you tip the beach bartender once he will take care of you. He even called my husband by his first name. D.R. is traveled mostly by Europeans and Canadians. It is starting to catch on now in the U.S. so go now while the prices aren't too high. We have booked a trip in August, this time we are taking grandchildren. Some of us are going platinum. Have a great trip and relax.

<Content>Beautiful beyond description and lots more than we expected. We stayed from June 17-24 in the Bavaro Princess and booked our trip through Apple Vacations. We flew nonstop with Delta out of Atlanta, Ga. There are representatives (Carlos and Carolina) on duty in the lobby and more than eager to help. I will say...once you are in your room, settle the kids down long enough to read the (blue) information booklet. We did not do that immediately and were very unorganized the first evening, but it was entirely our fault. All the information you need is in the room.Apple Vacations has a beach BBQ every week for their clients and it was great! That is all the more reason to book through Apple.Since so many others described every thing in detail, I will just say that the grounds were magnificent, the beach and sea awesome and the swim-up pool beautiful and refreshing, but my husband, son, his wife and our two grandsons aged 11 and 15 loved the sea and hung out there most of the time.I suppose some folks are telling the truth about their bad experiences but I am hard pressed to see how. I do not have one negative thing to say except the room will get musty if the AC and fan are not adjusted properly. I just wish the man complaining about lack of AC had been in our room (855). It was much too cold for me, but it was an excellent spot...close to the beach and the swim-up pool.The new restaurants are more beautiful than most in the USA. The El Gaucho is buffet for breakfast and lunch and overlooks a fantastic view of the sea. Al carte for dinner.They were renovating 2 of the restaurants we were entitled to, but we did not miss that. The food was more than plentiful and delicious. My family tried so many different dishes and most were reported excellent.I wonder if these folks who are sick and vomiting drink or eat to excess, or maybe it is like here in the USA...folks get stomach viruses all the time. Why not consider that before trashing a resort.We enjoyed every single moment of our time spent in the Bavaro Princess resort and will go back again.No bugs in the bed! No flies on the food! No diarrhea or vomiting..not even nausea. We used the ample amounts of bottled water for teeth brushing, etc. etc. The showers were adequate. If the water ran long enough it was scalding hot.AFA as waiting ten minutes for the tram...we often walked up to the magnificent lobby in less than five minutes. (We were very close to the beach.) It was a short wait back to the room if we wanted to catch the tram.They have they most beautiful lobby anywhere and my DIL and I went for cocktails every evening about 5.All in all...worth much more than we paid for it.One last thing...if you can stay in that beautiful place among those hard working people, being waited on daily and not tip...then I am sorry for you.

<Content>How do you say incompetence in spanish? I'm not a born complainer. I always have fun everywhere I go. I do about 2 trips a year and like to try different places and am always very satisfied and impressed. But this time... many small problems made my stay a bit annoying.First of all, I get in my room and the TV doesn't work, plus no remote. I call the reception and they send a guy whose real job most be cleaning the pool. Today, he has to repair the wire behind the TV... so he does so with all the talent of a pool cleaning guy. So although it was very hot, I had snow in my tv all week. Plus he didn't bring a remote and the few times I asked the reception to bring me one was just lost time I'll never get back.Plus, it's maybe personnal, but at an hotel, I have a routine. My girlfriend takes one hour to get ready for supper and I lay on the bed watching tv. But there, the TV was in the small living room, and I could only catch a glimpse of the full 20inch by lying in a very specific and uncomfortable position on the bed. So I had to sit on the uncomfortable sofa.The A/C in our room was not very good. Although by the noise it was making all night, you would think the thing was working. Felt like a plane's turbine was in there but never cought a cold breeze.One morning I have a piece of paper at my door saying the Hotel, because of renovation, will not get electricity from 10am to 4pm. Meaning all restaurants near the beach will be close. So at noon, I have to get out the beach, dress, take the mini-train thing and go to the main buffet... quite far from the beach.Let's talk about the shower... I have been to Europe where I found that shower and water pressure don't go together, but this was the worse. It was hard to rinse the soap off me. I felt like I had an old man spitting on my back.Room service. The second day, they came to do our room at 6pm. Just the time when you want to relax in the room before supper. The 5ft day... they make the room but forget to put towels back. We come to the room to take a shower before supper, we call reception and a very quick 1 hour and a half later... the towels come.The mini-train thing. The place is huge, you'll need to take the train. There, I found where all the carbon monoxide that creates the greenhouse effect comes from. As you ride and enjoy the scenery, you'll be attacked at every acceleration by blueish clouds of diesel. I'm not joking, people were covering their heads with towels.Oh, at the reception. I asked for a safe. They said with a smile that they didn't have any... ask another day.Now, this place is great though for someone who is trying to stop drinking. I never drank so little on vacation. You will really feel like the waiters were told to save on wine. When you sit at the restaurant, they'll offer you water. You'll say yes thinking that they'll pour the water and then offer the different wines. Oh, no! THe water is it. After that, the guy dissapears never to be seen again. And as you wave your hand in the hair yelling, wine please, you will find that they are very good on acting as if they don't see you.If you want wine, tell it to the guy that pours the water before he gets away. But don,t think you'll get a refill... I only took one one time. Usually, where I go, they pour me wine faster than I can drink it. I usually feel like Dyonisos at an orgy but there, I felt like a pregnant woman that can only drink half a glass.Service is the worst thing there. Whenever you ask for something... a spoon, a coffee, a drink at the pool bar, you feel like you are annoying them.I usually hand out about 40$ in tip for a week. There, I gave about 12$. And when I tipped them, it was not because they were good, i was trying to do positive reinforcement to have better service the next day. Didn't work at all.Finally, I go to the public restrooms near the beach. I stand at the urinal and flush, and there at this moment I understood where all the pressure from all the showers of the resort was going to... to this urinal. The pressure was so great when I pulled the handle, I was showered by its content. I tried to get drunk to forget about it but the waiter at the pool bar was playing a game called: don't serve a drink to the smelly guy even though he is getting aggressive and waving money in the air.Just want to show that it's not a bad hotel, the beach is nice, there is a lot of chairs and umbrellas. There are a lot of trees and flowers everywhere but incompetence about everywhere will create many small annoying events that spoils the trip.Go to the Bahia principe.

<Content>Hated it with a passion!!!! We just got back last night from DR...We stayed here three night s and had to change to a diff hotel as it was for sure the worse service we have ever received in a hotel...The front desk is not very friendly even if you speak the language..We had payed for oceanview and was told they were all taken and instead put us up far from the beach...I asked to speak to a mng and was told there was none around..In all the three days we stayed - only one day was the room made up---Tons of spider webs on the walls - the shower did not work and the closet door was broken..besides the musty smell and a celing fan that was ready to fall off..The food looked so bad that we were scare of eating...we had to wait 20 minutes for a waiter to give us coffee in the am....Get there early as there's not enough beach chair for everyone...Please stay @ another resort as this place is not worth paying a penny for....

<Content>Get What You Pay For I'll be brief...10 of us booked through Apple for an inexpensive getaway. We read all of the reviews, so we knew what to expect. Honestly, you get what you pay for. That is not good and it is not bad. My husband and I paid for the Platinum upgrade and felt it was WAY worth it. Our room was close to the beach and restaurants. Newer and cleaner. Better alcohol when you wanted to go to the lounge for it. The lounge was nice for refreshments, internet, help with restaurants, etc.The good...We avoided tap water in our rooms and did not get sick.Food was pretty good.Beach was beautiful.Casino was entertaining, as was parasailing, shark encounter and snorkeling.The not so good...The condition of the pool water ( and the people peeing in it).Drinks were low alcohol, so we drank lots of them!Chewed on by mosquitos and ants under the palapas.Some rooms had a musty smell that the AC couldn't get out.A little boring after a few days since leaving the resort is a little sketchy.CARLOS the Apple rep in hotel told half our group that their flight was pushed back when in fact it wasn't! They nearly missed their flight home! Wherever the fire happened, there was no trace of it during our visit last week. They did a great job of rebuilding. The hotel is huge, and must have been a real thing of beauty when it was first built. With the hassle getting to D.R. with passports, delays with broken down planes on the runway and the sketchy conditions here, I don't think we'll be back. We had fun being together, but Key West was better/easier last year.

<Content>Bavaro Princess - What to expect Just got back from DR - staying June 15 - 22nd at Bavaro Princess. 66 people traveled from Western PA for Sara and Jeremy's wedding..Our first issue was the Punta Cana airport was closed because of a plane with a flat tire - they could not move - so we landed at another airport -- traveling 1 hour and 40 minites by bus to the resort. We were all anxious to arrive after the early am start, plane ride and bus ride. Once arriving check in went pretty good. We were greeted by a waitress with beverages. Some rooms were ready, most were not. I was in building 7 room 702 -- STAY AWAY FROM THIS ROOM. Very musty even after 2 air freshners that I brought - air conditioning was noisy - and phone never worked. Bring BUG SPRAY. Spray your bed -- due to one girl had bites all over her legs - she was a mess. Also, don't walk in the grass. Building 7 was near the ocean and the busy pool. Never even went to the small pool near the lobby. Ocean is beautiful - beaches were great. Be prepared for topless women--at beach and the pool- especially if you have kids!! Service at the pool could have been better -- one bartender - and they are slow. We booked 2 restaurants -- they refrain from having you book -- and most of the time the restaurants were 1/2 empty. We booked ElPescador - we all did not like it. Shrimp ccktail was shreeded something with 1000 island dressing. Surf and turf disappointing as well as the grilled lobster. We also went to El Gaucho - it was GREAT -- the Argentina Steak was wonderful!!! Other meals were buffet - you could always find something -- also near the ocean was a hot dog and hamburger  french fry hut - french fries were really good - if there was nothing else available. The best part of the trip was the wedding on the beach of Sara and Jeremy !!! Congrats!!! it was a wonderful day and ceremony -- and they did a great job with the party afterwards. Take a mug with you - to drink the drinks --they stay colder - give the bartenders a buck or 2 and they will fill them for you. Some of the group got sick --- not sure why - stomach and bathroom issues. Drink plenty of water (agua) The resort is huge --- trams run pretty regular It is a nice walk and not that far . It was very hot -- only had 2 evenings of rain - but didn't last long at all. I did not book any trips my friends booked Outback Safari - said it was great -- also the Speed boat trip was good. Also the Booze cruise was said to be good. If you enjoy the ocean and beautiful beaches -- you won't go wrong! HAVE A GREAT TIME!!

<Content>Beautiful Beach I stayed at this resort from June 10th to June 17th. The resort was very nice but I was a little disappointed in the lobby, too much exposed concrete. We had a little trouble checking in because there were 6 ladies, 3 to a room, trying to check in and get adjoining rooms. We had requested them when we reserved our trip and our agent had requested them again the week before our arrival. I guess it doesn't matter because we were told there were no adjoining rooms available. After several requests and offering to wait to check in or move the next day to have the rooms the desk clerk finally agreed to arrange it but we didn't get the adjoining rooms until the next day. It was worth the effort but I did have to be persistant. We later tipped the guy for all his trouble.The beach is very pretty but could use a little attention...cigarette butts and a little trash pick up. The sand is great, no rocks and no big waves to fight off. Lots of chairs and palm trees for that much needed afternoon shade.The pool area was nice but I really didn't use it much.I played v-ball on the beach several days and it was lots of fun but I disagree that the staff puts together a team and plays for over an hour while guests have to wait. Whose vacation is this anyway? Most of them were just showing off. The rooms were very nice and the set up is great. I do prefer ocean view but the grounds were very nice and the tram was a nice touch. I have had trouble getting that musty smelll out of my suitcase. Their A/C just doesn't work like ours.The restaurants were fine. Nothing special except for the Asian restaurant. It was very good. Breakfast at the beach buffet was good too. I didn't go there for the food and there was plenty of variety so no one could go hungry. The fresh fruit and juices were very good. The outside self serve water and soda area was really nice.Most of the staff were really friendly and accomidating.It was a great vacation and I will return to Punta Cana but probably not this resort. It was OK but I would like to try another place. It was like many of the other resorts I have visited in Cancun and the Mayan Riviera. Nice but not special enough to return to.I had a great vacation but I think maybe this place is a little over rated and over priced. It was nice but I have stayed at nicer places for less money.

<Content>what you pay is what you get Our family of 6 (kids ages 16, 14, 12 and 7) vacationed 6/6-6/13 at Bavaro Princess. The most recent reviews really seem to accurately assess BP. So, I will just try to hit on some of the topics we had concerns about before we went. We paid less to stay here than other all inclusives and I would say we got our moneys worth. The resort is beautful, well manicured with a wonderful beach( plenty of shaded huts). Yes, it is huge but the tram shuttle is convenient and easy to use. The rooms are large(no problems with odors or bugs) and the maid service was fine. Definite water pressure problem but really no big deal. There is a sewer odor by buildings 20-21 so I would avoid them. The food was okay, (I am blessed with children who are not fussy eaters) so we could always find something to eat, some days were just harder than others and there was always a pasta bar at dinner and lunch. Lets face it if you are looking for exceptional food don't stay at an all-inclusive. Trust me nobody starved. Ala carte restaurants were average and a nice change of pace from the buffet, but service was bad(didn't get our order entirely correct at any one restaurant). The one buffet we really didn't care for was Dominican night(thursday), but as mentioned didn't have a problem finding something to eat. My only real complaint would be the service at the pool/swim up bar. Pretty ridiculous to only have one bartender for a 15 stool swim up bar. We gave him a nice tip the first day but really didn't get very good service. Other workers(waiters, maids, maintenance....) were polite and helpful. Night time shows nothing exciting and not much else to do at night except for lobby bar(which had the best drinks) Outside the resort forget about shopping, I'm use to bargaining in Mexico but these people were uncomfortably pushy and rude. We just turned around and went back to the resort. So, if you're looking for a reasonably priced vacation at a beautiful laid back resort with average service and food and not a big night life Bavaro Princess will suit your needs.

<Content>Great Place, but I have been to the DR 5 times, but, this was the first time at the Bavarro Princess. The rooms were very nice, I would have preferred the air conditioning to be a little cooler, but, it was certainly liveable. As you have probably read, the water pressure in the showers drops considerably during the getting ready for dinner hours, about 4-7 P.M., but, again, you can get by. The food in the various restaurants was very good, but, even in 1 of the brand new restaurants, El Gaucho, the steak place, there is no air conditioning, a little hot. The new breakfast and lunch buffet, on the beach, is nice, but, again, no air conditioning. The employees are very nice and, if you can speak some Spanish to them, they really open up, after all, you are in their country. I know this place is an all-inclusive, but, please, give some thought to bringing a bunch of 1 dollar bills with you and tip the staff if they do a nice job, it's only a dollar to us, but, you will light up their faces with a dollar here and there, they are very appreciative. Also, please don't forget the ground staff, they work extremely hard and very long hours and don't have the normal opportunity of receiving any extra tips, just a dollar or two to show your appreciation for keeping the hotel clean and enjoyable. Also, if you think of it, a nice gift for the maid, shampoo, conditioner, skin lotions, scented candles and, if you have the room, some school supplies for the kids, copy books, pencils, notepads, coloring books, crayons, etc. are very much needed and appreciated. This is a very large complex, 98 acres and they do have tram cars to transport you around. Overall, this is a beautiful place, the food was good, the staff excellent, but, the lack of air conditioned restaurants would probably keep me from returning to the Bavaro Princess, it is very hot and humid. For breakfast it wasn't that big a deal, but, when you dress up for dinner, men must wear long pants and collared shirts in the restaurants, not the buffets, it's not very pleasant sitting there trying to eat while you are sweating your --- off. So, if you don't mind the heat and humidity, while eating, this is the place for you.

<Content>You Get What You Pay For Just got back last night. I did read all reviews before I went to BP and I had very low expectations. We were pleasantly surprised in some instances, though. First... I cannot stress enough how absolutely beautiful Punta Cana is. The beaches are the nicest I've seen and I travel extensively and have been specifically to Maui 3 times. Every tropical picture you've ever imagined you will find here. At B.P., it's the same way.I will preface the rest by saying this: in any disappointment we had on our trip regarding the resort (all but one instance) it was very obvious to me the staff was trying very hard to make us happy. However, please do not underestimate :The language barrier is a significant problem. I speak some spanish and had a difficult time understanding them and vice versa. This was specifically a problem on our last day when the adjoining room was being worked in and workers were spraying an acrylic lacquer into the tub. The strength of the odor is the equivalent of sniffing a wash rag soaked in ammonia. It was horrific. I tried to communicate with the front desk about the absurdity of this working being done and not be expected to effect other travelers and it was completely lost on them. I became high on the fumes and extremely sick. Their offer was well, we can change your room??. My point is this: it was totally lost on them that we had to be in that room while we packed all of our belongings while our throats were burning and we could not breathe. We were also literally going to be in our new room for 10 hours before departing. It was totally ridiculous. When I went to guest services, our liason if there is a problem, I told her the whole story and she asked me if i needed housekeeping AAARRRRGGGHHHHH!!!! You would not believe how long it took me to get the name of the manager of the hotel. I plan on contacting this person regarding the above.Food is below average, period. Stick with the buffet, you'll have far better luck finding something you can acutally eat. The service in the reservation only restaurants is ridiculous. Servers speak extremely broken english and half the time our food was not even what we ordered.Rooms are outdated and musty. DO NOT upgrade to platinum to get a spot near the beach, they'll just give you a place near the beach if you ask. Our last room that we stayed in one night was awesome... room 025. It appeared to be slightly newer than building than previous room (355) and was quiet and did not stink. When we arrived in our first room, the phone did not work and neither did the a/c. I had to get on the tram and ride 10 minutes back to the lobby for them to tell me they'd send someone to fix phone and spray something in our room.This resort is in a beautiful location, but the best thing I can say about it other than that is that it's really cheap. You do get what you pay for here (except for the view which is work a million bucks, easily).Good luck!!

<Content>Loved the suite! I wasnt too sure about this resort at first because it was listed as 4 star and a rating of 3.5. I'm pretty sure it's a 5 star.Here are some perks I remain thankful for:-Hot water, good water pressure, ALL THE TIME-Two pools, once for relaxing, another for the activity minded-Beds (often taken though) on the beach.-Key for the safe is free-English tv-Fresh warm beach towels, all the time-Lobby looks great at night-Free catamarans (if you're feeling lucky dont pay the insurance)What surprised me the most was the suite, which is the standard room. There's 8 of them in each building. It's quite spacey and decorated well enough, with paintings here and there. There's no balcony in the back as in many of the places I've been. However, the doubledoors will give you a nice view of the grounds.There's no lock in the bathroom, but revolving doors that separate the toilet and bathtub from the sink/quadruple mirror.Given your sizeable room, the problem then is that there is much space to cover between the beach and the lobby/buffet. Transportation can come often enough but I have waited for more than 10 min on some occasions.Repairs were still going on the 3 restaurants by the beach that had burned down (fixed now). In the meantime, they allowed us to make reservations on the 3 sister resorts. We went to the Caribe Princess I believe for Brazilian food. The food was good, but the resort didnt look as nice. It made us very happy that we went to the 5 star.Some of us werent too happy that there was no AC, except in the Japanese restaurant. They also serve the same things for lunch and breakfast everyday :(You cant expect a Vegas-like performance from their troupe: they're doing 7 different routines a week.The Carribean ones were the better ones (for the sexy costumes) and I like Thriller on fantasy night.The other one I saw was The Lion King and thought it was horrid.Service was very good. The only glitch were the reservations, which were inflexible at the time but you wont encounter that anymore. We also never got our working remote control, a pen, and the missing umbrellas arrived one day later.The rest was fantastic, especially if you make an effort to speak Spanish. A warm and enthusiastic staff really makes your day.We got to know maybe 40 of them. By the end, people were waving at us and we smiled back, having no idea who they were.We really pushed it on our last night there: we came back at 3 am, went to the buffet, took some food (amazed that it was still available) and asked them to wrap it so we can take it back to our rooms). Then we asked them to send us a car, that would take us back to our room.Nightlife btw is decent. There's club Arreito which belongs to the chain so you can get in for free. 2 min by cab and one free shuttle at midnight I believe. There's also Mangu in the Occidental Grand Flamenco. Entrance is $6 USD and free drink.Both have two dance floors. Reggaeton, hip hop and dance music are abundant. They'll mix in bachata and merengue, maybe 5% of tracks. There are lots of locals on the sidelines which is really a sad story for me. I didnt think that's a wise use of their money...For those who are going to a resort for the first time:If you're going for expeditions, shopping outside, exploring, getting lessons from the aquatic club, just be careful. Know that you can bargain. This is a third world country and they will lie to you to get money. Know the rules and what they can charge you for. Being nice to them, being firm and giving them a nice tip instead of having them rely on commission from their boss will get you ahead.

<Content>A wonderful trip! We just arrived home last night from the Bavaro Princess after 7 wonderful nights. We were hesitant about going after reading some of the reviews. We found the resort to be great. We booked thru Apple, they were very organized and did all the work. The weather was usually great ,rain in the evening and one cloudy day, otherwise super. The hotel provides umbrellas in each room.Our room was in building 44, which we really liked, half way to everything --the beach and the Hispana Rest. We did not go Platinum and did not miss it. You can use the internet in the lobby -$10 for an hour to be used as needed.We never experienced any bugs, water problems or air conditioner problems. We left the maid a tip daily and we were always supplied with everything we could possible need, extra coffee, water, soda  beer.Everyone was always very friendly and had a smile on their face.The food was usually good, you just had to be careful of what you ate. There was always so much to choose from...As everyone has said the beach is wonderful!!! The finest white sand we have ever seen, and the water was beautiful!!! Much better then in Mexico as we have been there many times. There is not much shopping but there is a flea market across the street and also one down the beach on the right. They do hassle you about going into their store but we just said no and kept walking.We did get up early some days to get lounges under the cabanas as they were gone by 8:30, just keep your beach towel each night and use it the next day until you get a clean one. Enjoy drinking your morning coffee on the beach!As I said we had a wonderful relaxing trip and will definitely being going back again next year.Enjoy your trip whenever you go!!!

<Content>Great time at the Bavaro Princess....But We stayed at the Bavaro Princess May 24- 31, 2007.The check-in went quickly and was very smooth and organized.There were 14 in our group, and non of us were offered the platinum upgrade. However, I don't think we missed out on a thing by not having it. The bungalows were very nice. Upon arrival we did notice a bitof a musty smell, but after a while we didn't notice it anymore.We were in building 24, it was a good location for us - it wasalmost exactly half way between the beach and the main building for the buffet, stores, lobby bar, etc. The beach - aahhh, it was gorgeous! Always clean and clear.We didn't have any problems getting chairs either at the beach or at the pool. Being late risers, we had worried about this issue.I would like to warn travelers about one issue - after our encountter with this man, I watched continuously for the rest of our stay and didn't see him except on Saturday and Sunday, hedidn't reappear through the week. Here is the story - there are several men that walk up and down the beach trying to sellexcursions i.e. parasailing, scubadiving, etc - however the legitimate ones will be readily identifiable - their companies logo printed on their shirt. No need for worry with them. But, please be cautioned - there is also a man dressed in plain clothes (white t-shirt, jeans or shorts) that claims to be sellingpictures of travelers with monkeys. He approaches ONLY the people close to the water and makes friendly conversation, gives his sales pitch - pointing and showing a location off the resort to go for this picture. He makes conversation for a while, then he attempts to make a deal to sell marijuana. There are security guards on the beach, but we had never seen them until this guy contacted some of our group. Then, there were security guards on both sides. This guy served as a pointer. If a deal had of been made, I'm really scared to think of the consequences. I, along with the others in our group think this was a set -up. We watched very closely from that point on.This guy would talk to the security guards thereafter, and then approach other prospects. After our scare we watched himtalk to othe people, I then went and talked to them - he had offered them the same ruse of monkey pictures, making a deal on the cost of the marijuana, and telling them he would be back in thirty minutes. I know we thawrted at least two of his deals by talking to the people. As I said earlier, I kept an eagle eye out for the rest of our stay, I only saw him on the weekend.Be careful! The legitmate workers will be identifiable - and are ok, but this guy is not. Keep in mind this is a very poor country,and unknowing tourists could get caught in a trap and cost them alot of money to get out of it. It was an unnerving experience. There, as in the U.S. pot is illegal. However, when this jerk approached one of the young adults in our group, they thoughtit was ok. Luckily I intercepted just in the nick of time - I meanabout 2 minutes and it could have been disasterous.This guy is very suave with his choice of prospects. Not only with us, but with the others that he confronted as well. All younger, close to the water, and only couples. No groups ofpeople. Believe me, from that point on we all stayed in ourlarge group! I was disappointed, and thought this was goingto ruin the rest of our trip (mainly mine) due to worry. However,we all had a major talk - not to mention the scare deterred any further issues. The remainder of our trip was fabulous!The food lacked alot. We could usually find something that we would recognize, but there weren't a whole lot of options. We ate alot of pasta from the pasta bar in the buffet. The beach buffet had the most americanized choices. (pork chops, corn on the cob, roasted potatoes, chicken, burgers, and hot dogs).Overall we had a great time! The resort is beautiful, the workers were very nice. It is a resort we would go back to!!

<Content>Beware of born complainers... Bavaro Princess IS great!! I am just returning from 1 week in Punta Cana and the Bavaro Princess(June 3-10) and I feel obligated to write a review considering some of the negative comments that were shared by travellers recently. Having visited the Bavaro Princess in Punta Cana almost 4 years ago and truly enjoying myself then, I was worried based on what other tourists were writing. I understand that the resort had gone thru some difficult times lately with a fire having ravaged over 3 of the property's restaurants, but all was back in order as of Monday, June 4th. We enjoyed a week of beautiful and warm sunshine with a small period of rain late Saturday night (30 mins)- Punta Cana's white beaches and turquoise waters are exquisite!!-it is quite shocking to me that travellers would emphasize on airports, security within them,entry fee, etc... please remember that you are visiting a third worldcountry and all efforts are put forth to make our holidays an enjoyable one. We booked with Signature Vacations and flew with Air Transat where the $10. tourist card to enter the country was included. We chose club class with Transat and the in-flight service was excellent- a definate must for Canadian travellers if your budget can afford it.Back to the resort...as most travellers have commented, the resort grounds are beautiful, clean, and well kept. Many species of birds live on the resort, peacocks, swans, ducks and they are a pleasure to cross... don't be shy to feed them some bread!! The resort operates a trolley from 7am- 12 midnight as it is quite spacious and very large. Most rooms are identical in look and feel; you may want to request a villa closer to the main pool or beach (villas 10, 11, or 29 are of close proximity)- our room was clean and a bit stuffy when we arrived but that is to be expected as they don't operate air conditionners while no one is there and day temperatures can easily reach over 40 degrees when you factor in the humidity. The room's mini-bar is stocked with water, pop, and beer and is filled regularlyon a daily basis. The room cleaning lacked a bit of attention but all in all things were fine. We didn't experience any critters in our room... 3 of the resorts restaurants re-opened on June 4th; El Gaucho steak house (which is also used as the main lunch buffet restaurant during the day and is located alongside the beach), El Pescador (seafood), and Bella Pasta (pasta). El Gaucho at night was so-so, El Pescador was probably the worst of the 3, and Bella Pasta was truly enjoyable.The waiters, restaurant managers, and other staff were quite friendlyat Bella Pasta which made things very pleasant (don't forget to tip some of these fellows as they truly try their best to make our holidays most enjoyable). The lunch buffet offered a wide variety of food ranging from soups, salads, pasta, meats, fish, fresh fruits,and a wide selection of desserts. The main breakfast buffet restaurant, La Hispaniola (located at the front of the resort and was also another night restaurant choice with several thematic nights- no reservations required here) was also quite enjoyable with an egg station, toast, yogurts, fresh fruits, and other local or international foods. The resort also had a snack bar restaurant located just in front of El Gaucho on the beach for those who enjoy aburger, hot-dog, and/or fries throughout the afternoon. Tourists alsohad 2 other restaurant options (Licey and DelMar) which came at an extra cost. 2 other of their main restaurants, Sakura and Chopin, were closed during our stay for renovations.The resort had several available activities to choose from; bocce ball, ping-pong, darts, shuffleboard, etc...(at no cost) as well as a water sports area for those who enjoy parasailing, banana-boating, deep-sea fishing, etc...the animation staff was quite nice and alwayshad a smile. The nightly shows were slightly under par except for maybe their rendition of the Lion King on one of the nights. Resort and pool bars offered a wide variety of drinks without having to pay the extra cost for platinum- if you enjoy local beer (Presidente), margaritas, and other exotic drinks, you will be fine.One honorable mention has to be given to one of the waitresses at La Hisponiola restaurant- her first name is Yesenia; she was an absolutesweetheart and always had a beautiful smile... believe me, it makes a huge difference!!The resort also offered free shuttles to and from the Tower casino...I recall having read that their casino is a joke... completely false-the Tower casino is very nice and cozy and offers a wide variety of games for those who enjoy a bit of gambling...slot machines (5 and 25 cents), caribbean poker, 3-card poker, roulette, craps, and blackjack...beware however of bad blackjack players!!!Contrary to what most people think, the weather in the Caribbean over the summer months can be a crap shoot- you will no doubt encounter warm and humid conditions but also remember that these months are more prone to heavy rains...all in all, our second visit to the Bavaro Princess was very enjoyable and I would recommend this resort to anyone...don't forget that if certain areas are not pleasing to you (room, loud air-conditionner, bugs, etc...), don't be shy to request a change or speak to your tour representative located directly on the resort grounds. Thanks to Punta Cana and the Bavaro Princess for a most enjoyable week!!!

<Content>What a beautiful resort and sooooo relaxing!!!! We just returned from a wonderfully relaxing vacation at the Bavaro Princess (May 19-26th). I have never done anything like this before and so was eagerly anticipating this trip (just graduated from graduate school and this was a present to ourselves). We travelled with great friends of ours and it was wonderful. We booked through Apple Vacations and I highly recommend this. Everything was taken care of and the Apple Rep. met us at the airport and got us to where we needed to go. The Apple Reps were very friendly and helpful. Travel to Punta Cana: Our flight down was rather uneventful which was good. We found the Apple Rep (after paying $10 Tourist fee/person) and we loaded a bus to our resort. Once at the resort, we had already upgraded to Platinum (which I highly recommend) but were confused about where to go. There is a Platinum Lounge to check-in at, but we didn't know how to get there. My husband was determined to find it on his own. We finally got there and they greeted us with Presidente beer. My husband enjoyed this part. The RoomsWe had to wait to check in to our rooms, so we hung out at the Platinum Lounge and booked all of our reservations for the ala carte restaurants at once. This was a great feature of the Platinum package (otherwise you would need to book in the main lobby each day). The rooms were very spacious. The rooms were a little outdated but very comfortable. We did see a roach twice but no other bugs. The maids kept the rooms very clean and left flowers several days (we tipped her daily and left her small gifts which I believe that they appreciate greatly). They speak no English so this was a good opportunity to use my little bit of Spanish. I greatly enjoyed this part. The water pressure was pretty poor but I took showers at peak times (before dinner) so this would explain this. I always had warm water as well. We really enjoyed the slippers and bathrobes that were part of the Platinum package. The frig was kept stocked our entire stay there which was nice. We enjoyed Rum and Sprite drinks (this is very good!). All in all, the rooms were fine and comfortable. It was like being in a small apartment - plenty of room.Restaurants:The Hispaniola (the main buffet) was one of our favorite places to be. They had such a wide variety of foods and so all four of us were able to find something that we liked. We ate most breakfasts and lunches there. I was rather brave with my eating and tried a bit of everything. I don't know if this is what got me sick, but I did have bad diarrhea for one day. I believe that my body was just not used to the different foods. I usually have a tough stomach so it perplexed me (maybe a virus?) Just be careful with what you eat, all the fruit can be a natural laxative (Oh, and they fry their food in coconut oil which is also a laxative...so just be cautious). However, my husband ate the same things I did and did not get sick at all. It's so hard to tell. We ate at the Pescador (seafood) which was excellent. All four of us loved our meals. We also had the opportunity to eat at Licey as part of the Platinum package and it was good. The service was great and we had fun trying our Spanish. It is gourmet food and very interesting. We also tried Chopin and it was okay. I don't recommend this one (another buffet). The strolling musician (pianist on a boat) was a nice touch. As part of the Platinum package, we were able to go to the other Princess resorts and eat. We had our best dining experiences at Il Bacio (Italian) and La Petite Fondue (all fondue restaurant!) which are at the other Princess resorts. We did truly enjoy the Hispaniola which is located at the main lobby. It was comfortable and the staff were great. We also had the opportunity to use room service at any time as part of the Platinum Package (can you tell we loved the Platinum package??). It was just nice to order room service in the morning if we didn't feel like leaving our rooms early and the food was great. The beach:Wow!!! I have never seen a more beautiful beach. The sand was like sugar under your feet and so clean. The water was aqua and the sky a royal blue. It was absolutely amazing. It is forever etched in my mind. We never had trouble finding a palapa and we didn't usually get to the beach until between 9-10 am. We didn't always get the best palapa, but that was okay with us. We spent a large amount of time in the water. The water was calm for most of the week, but one day, we had huge waves. I ended up losing my sunglasses from being knocked over by a wave. It was lots of fun though. Please be sure to bring lots of sunscreen as you will get burned. I wore SPF 30 every day and ended up with a sore back on one of the last days. The sun is intense. The topless sunbathers took a little bit of adjustment on our part as we are Americans and not used to seeing this. We also got to try sea kayaking which was lots of fun and it was free. The beach was my favorite part and it was just breathtaking. There is food on the beach if you don't want to go to the buffet. The food is so-so and the hamburgers there are different than we are used to...so we opted to go to the main buffet not a big deal. Excursions:We went on the Outback Safari excursion and I recommend this highly. We learned so much more about the Dominican Republic from our tour guide than we would have if we stayed on the resort the whole time. The country is beautiful with mountains and plantations. We took some extra balls that our son was not using at home and gave them to kids that were playing. This was a rewarding experience because these kids don't have much. The trip was amazing and our tour guide, Omar, made the trip memorable and worthwhile. We tried Mamajuana on the trip (yum!) and got to buy fresh cocoa and coffee. We also got to go snorkelling (Platinum package) which was awesome. The fish were amazing to see. We were only able to be out there for an hour...I could have done this for several hours. It was great nonetheless.The resort:The resort is very spacious and it does take a while to walk, but who cares. We had no time pressures and so, it was wonderful to take a leisurely stroll through the mangrove and the beautiful resort. The animals were incredible, peacocks, parrots, iguanas, and many interesting birds. There are trams that go by all the time and so, if you want, you can jump on. We did this when we were tired and sunburnt. The grounds are well taken care of....they work so hard to keep it nice. There was beauty everywhere you looked...I never seen anything like this. I was truly impressed.Overall, it was an amazing trip and the most relaxed I've been in a very long time. It is so amazing to go to a place where all of your needs are taken care of. The slower pace of the DR was awesome and greatly appreciated. There is not much nightlife here. We tried to go to the discotech one night and there were 6 people there. We were usually so tired by nighttime that we went to bed after watching the shows. They work hard to put on the shows and it was entertaining. As far as drinks go ,the Coco Loco drink was amazing as well as the Blue Hawaiian. It was great to be out on the beach with a drink in your hand. The bartenders were very nice and waited on us quickly most of the time. Sometimes , you need to ask for alcohol in the drinks..just to let you know. The staff are so friendly and helpful and always have a smile. If you try to communicate with them in Spanish, it means a lot to them. I could tell that the staff appreciated when I tried to speak Spanish. We did hear other Americans complaining about this or that. A vacation is what you make of it. It is all about perspective. If you are the type of person who looks to find something wrong, then you will find it. There were a couple things here and there that didn't go right, but such is life. I went on this trip to spend time with my husband and friends and it was such a great time for all of us. Overall, it was an amazing experience and I would definitely go back to this resort.

<Content>White Sands and Clear Blue Water!!!!! We got back from Punta Cana on May 20th, 2007 and had LOTS OF FUN AND RELAXATION in the sun...the service was great and the food was alright...the beach and water...AMAZING!!!!! If you wanna go somewhere to relax and enjoy the beach, this is the place. Unless you wanna stay in a pool everyday then u should book a Holiday Inn vacation!!!! We had the Platinum (oceanview) package well worth it, you have your own lobby (besides the main lobby). The Platinum Lounge was open from morning to 11pm and you had your own front desk, open lounge to all kinds of beverages (alcohol) and snacks, book your a la carte whenever during the day for the week and not have to worry about doing it first thing in the morning. The resort is pretty big and you might wanna think about taking the train that runs in the resort to get around, for those who r lazy and can't walk 3 feet to the next stop, (you'll see alot of that especially when there are 10 other people waiting at a stop trying to get around the resort), that runs until midnight, u can call one to the front of the main lobby to pick u up after 12. Tip your maid everyday couple of $$, the bartenders, and don't forget the people who make this place beautiful the landscapers (wear green uniform). The food was alright if u don't mind it being a lil bland, buffet was pretty good, they have an all american buffet just for the americanos (if you go to another country and can't eat there food...c'mon) stay in the USA. The weather was incredible except for a couple of nights were it rained for a couple of hours other than that...HOT! Also check out the markets that are on the other side of the beach, just around the bend (remember, everything to your left)! Entertainment was alright, there's not much else to do in the evening and the live band was pretty good. Try the MAMAJUANA, excellente!! Worth that one week of peace, relaxation and fun! It's not an adult only resort there r kids everywhere, if that's what your looking for.

<Content>The good and the bad We went to this resort for our honeymoon, we had booked a honeymoon suite which I do not recommend only because they put the honeymooners all the way in the back of the resort and no where near the beach and you can see the street, so we ended up switching our room to be closer to the main pool and the beach. The service was AMAZING they were very nice and switched our room with no problems at all. The food was ok it wasn't bad but not fantastic. We ate at every restaurant except for the seafood place. I found the La Hispaniola the best because it is buffet and there were many options to choose from. However most of the restaurant is not air conditioned The room was great very spacious and the grounds were so nice very well up keep there was always someone working on the grounds. One thing we really enjoyed is the wildlife we saw so many different animals like fish, geese, peacocks, flamingos, parrots, woodpeckers. It was really nice. The was a fire there back in March and though all the restaurants were open except for one they are rebuilding and that is right behind the main pool so while your trying to relax at the pool you can hear the banging and construction going on they tried to keep the music always playing to cover it up but didn't really work. The other thing was there was not much for entertainment they had a show every night at 10pm and that was pretty much it. The resort is extremely big and require you to take trolleys everywhere which wasn't bad but when you want to grab a bite to eat and you have to wait for a trolley it can be annoying. If you make reservations at a la carte restaurant you cannot be late or they do not accept you so when you need to get somewhere and waiting for a trolley (that has enough room on it) it makes it difficult.Overall we had a decent trip the resort was a nice place but would not return to that resort but would go back to DR they have amazing beaches!!!

<Content>Great Value for Money 2 Couples went to Punta Cana from Friday May 11 thru Friday May 18th. We booked thru Nancy at Liberty Travel but did an Apple vacation. The plane ride was smooth no problems coming and going on USA3000. The movies were terrible. Our plane landed a little after 1000 and we were on the beach by noon. The complex was very large. We did upgrade to the Platinum. I did think it was worth it..... The lounge was nice.....They had a cappucino machine there....you could get ice from the attendent....they had sandwiches and lots of drinks( they ran out of Amaretto , which is what I drink). Anna was very attentive at night to all our needs.Having the platinum upgrade ...we were pretty close to the beach. Our friends room was ready so we went to their suite. The bathroom could do for upgrading. We did have hot water, but it was sometimes just trickles. It was nice to have a coffemaker and a refridgerator. Also with the platinum, you could make your reservations in the lounge at any time. I heard one woman ( who did not upgrade) went to the Apple tour guide and stood in line around noon for a half an hour and was told to come back at 530pm. ( she probably didn't attend the orientation)I also had the 40 minute massage. Both people have to go together or if one person shows up ...they get the 40 minutes.We also went into the jacuzzis in the spa. The water was not that hot. The hottest water was in the spa showers. They were delightful.We did the Outback Safari......We had Sammy and Ramon. They were very funny and infomative.Our friends did the snorkeling . They said it was the best snorkling they had done.The food was okay. Remember you don't come here for the food. We went to the fondue place at Punta Cana Princessand it was fun. We ate at Lichey (free with the upgrade). The filet mignon with the pepper sauce was delicious. The only problem with this restaurant was they were slow. Also we ordered coffee with dessert......never got the coffee.We went to a Tex Mex restaurant , I think at the Punta Cana Princess......they brought us complimentary frozen marghettas ( the made it just like home) the food there was above average.We also ate at El Gaucho. We had the Argenitine steak, which was quite tasty. The nice thing about the platinum upgrade was that you could go to other resorts......They picked us up at the platinum lounge and brought us back about 2 hrs later.The casino ( outside the hotel) was not worth it. It was not Atlantic City or Vegas. The shows were in Spanish at the main Lobby .We went to one show only. Never did go back.....They started at 1000pm ( I thought it was a little late). The TV were big in the rooms. I was surprised at all the American stations you could get. I especially enjoyed the swim up bar. The internet at the platinum lounge was broken ( they had 2 terminals). When I contacted the Apple representive both were fixed the next day. That was nice you could check your email free.We also went to one of the resorts to play mini-golf. Don't waste your time.....It is a very old 9 hole course.Apple vacations did give you a beach party. They did go thru a lot of trouble.....It rained after we had eaten and we ran back to the room in the rain.All in all....we did have a good time. Just watch what you eat and drink and you will be fine.Everyone here was very friendly. I never met a rude person the whole time we were there.

<Content>The Truth about the Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort Just got back yesterday from 4 days and 3 nights at the Bavaro Princess and would highly recommend this hotel for anyone! We went Platinum and enjoyed the extra services. We also waited to upgrade until we got there. Apple wanted like $55 per person per day to upgrade, when in fact the resort only charges $35 pp per day or in our case $110 per person. Not sure why Apple is charging more鈥?.so just a hint鈥?upgrade when you get there and save yourself some money.The Platinum Upgrade - Gets you a couple boxes of cheap cigars, bottle of rum, fruit basket, 20 minute free massage pp, free water sport activity, one dinner at Licey (discussed below), use of the Platinum Lounge during your stay, better booze, and if you can get it, the upgraded suite (closer to the beach  main pool and a liquor dispenser in your room). We upgraded the service only, since they had no Platinum rooms available during our stay. The nicest thing about the upgrade was the use of the Platinum Lounge. It鈥檚 basically concierge service for check-in, check-out, booking all your dinners and activities, and dealing with any problems you may have. They have top shelf alcohol and all the beer you could want (Presidente, Bud and MGD). They serve a light breakfast buffet, lunch and snack sandwiches throughout the day. It鈥檚 also very strategically located at the resort. It鈥檚 a nice place to meet, relax, and plan your day. And oh ya, you get free room service as well.  The rooms 鈥?the nicest in DR we鈥檝e seen so far. We鈥檝e been to the Melia Caribe Tropical, the Sunscape Beach, Sunscape Casa Del Mar, Jack Tar Village, and the Catalonia Bavaro. By far these are the best and cleanest rooms we鈥檝e seen. Very large suites, no problems with water pressure (depends what you are use to), not one bug and plenty of cold air to cool you off. We did talk to 3 couples that had bugs in their rooms. Advice, check your bed and room for ants/bugs prior to getting into it at night. Remember, you are on a tropical island with lots of bugs. Be careful out there! The resort immediately transferred them to another bug-less room, fumigated the original, and they were satisfied. All the rooms are the same size but some come with hot tubs in the bathroom and liquor dispensers as stated above when you upgrade!!!!! The restaurants 鈥?Reservations can be booked when you arrive for every night. Book in the main lobby across from the Check-out desk in the rotunda area, almost right outside the Main Buffet. Platinum guests can book everything from the Platinum lounge. We tried the following restaurants. Pescador (the seafood restaurant) is set up inthe main buffet since the fire. It was wonderful. Each of us got something different and the quality of the food and service was excellent. El Gaucho (the beef restaurant) is set up in the Choppin since the fire. It was our favorite spot. Get the Argentinean Steak, or the chicken was also to die for. And finally, Licey (the Seafood place that comes free with the Platinum upgrade鈥?32 pp if you choose to eat there) is the only restaurant that is air conditioned. The meal and service were incredible thanks to our friend Juan. He did a great job keeping our glass and plates full. The place is real nice because you get to watch the Flamingos frolic outside your window as you eat. Of all the places we鈥檝e been in the DR, this was definitely the best food I鈥檝e come across. Breakfast was in the main buffet areaand always good. The omelets and eggs are made to order, and they plenty of other stuff to fill you up. The juice bar is really cool. Freshly squeezed right there in front of you. For lunch you can do the main buffet, go to the platinum lounge, or they set up a nice buffet on the beach with plenty of lunch items to keep you interested. The beach 鈥?Bavaro Beach is rated one of the best in the Caribbean and I can see why. Wow! The sand is incredible, plenty of chaises and palpas (huts) to sit under and oh so clean. The water was rough during our stay. The waves were quite large. If you are expecting the crystal clear glass calm waters of the Caribbean Sea don鈥檛 go here. This is the Atlantic, or at least where the Atlantic and Caribbean come together. It鈥檚 choppy, and the under-toe is rough. If you want calmer waters, go to La Romana on the south east part of the island. Or search for a resort with a more protected (coral reef or cove) shore.Service  Staff 鈥?these people understand that tourism is their life blood. They are the most pleasant, happy and helpful people I ever come across. The degree of the service you receive is going to be up to you during your vacation. If you are pleasant with them, they willbe 100x more pleasant in return. If you moan all day and night, they will tire of you, and you will not receive good service. They will purposely ignore you, as they should. We found that some vacationers will just never be happy and they will try and 鈥渂ring down鈥?everyone around them. Misery breeds misery! Try and learn some of the language(Spanish) before you get down there or have them help you while you are there. Make that a goal of yours. Try and learn 2 words or phrases a day. The workers appreciate that. A friendly 鈥淗olla鈥?(Hello) goes a long way in making someone鈥檚 day. It鈥檚 actually very fun! Try it, relax, and smile people鈥?.you are on vacation! They work very very hard to make you feel at home and relaxed, maybe鈥?just maybe鈥?you could show them a little respect and appreciation with a smile or a tip here and there as well. Whenever I visit the DR I know that a 鈥淕eorge Washington鈥?($1 bill) goes a long way. We always put a couple singles on our table after we eat, slide the drink servers a buck here and there, hand the grounds keepers a single every once in a while in passing, and even tip the train drivers when we get off. You will see the same workers day in and day out. By tipping them, they will remember your face, and your name as well. Remember, you don鈥檛 have to tip to get great service. Just be happy and respectful. They will return the favor.Grounds and getting around 鈥?The grounds are beautiful! There are peacocks, flamingos, chickens, and ducks roaming free all over the property鈥?.babies in tow. There is also a mini zoo on property that鈥檚real cool. If you get there at feeding time (early am), they will actually let you in the cages with some of the animals. The resort is spotless with flowers blooming and all kinds of interesting vegetation. DON鈥橳 WEAR HIGH HEALS ladies. Many of twisted ankles because of it. The sidewalks are stamped concrete and have pretty bigcracks. Many of heals got caught in the cracks and ankles go twisted.Your on vacation so get comfortable, go with flats and save those ankles. Also, be careful not to roll your ankles as you get off the sidewalks when the train is coming. It doesn鈥檛 appear so, but there is quite the lip off the sidewalks. The trains run all night long at various intervals. This is what we found during our stay. 7:00-11:00am every 2-3 minutes, from 11:00am-5:00pm every 5-10 minutes (they slow down), from 5-12:00pm every 3-5 minutes. If you don鈥檛 want to walk鈥?don鈥檛! Wait for the train to come. If there is no room on the first one, the second one will be right behind it and have room. There are specified stops, but it will stop and pick you up or drop you off anywhere. By the way, the construction is coming along nicely. It appears everything will be complete by the end of June. The Spa 鈥?very nice and fairly in-expensive as far as spa services go. The ladies used our complementary 20 minute massages (provided with the Platinum Upgrade) to get 40 minutes each. Then they did a signature facial (55 minutes) as well. Relaxed, relaxed, relaxed! They enjoyed themselves immensely, and if you use the spa once, you can use some of it鈥檚 fee for service items such as the steam bath or sauna, for free. Book your appointment, and use the spa early, and you鈥檒l be able to take advantage of some the services that would normally cost you a couple extra bucks. I took a steam bath each morning. The first one cost me $5.00, and every other day was free. Why? Because I was friendly, nice, and got to know the staff at the spa. Pools 鈥?there are two pools, each with it鈥檚 own personality. There is the Swim-up Bar Pool by the beach. It鈥檚 a very nice free form pool with lots of activities going on all day. The water is very clean and the bartenders are very entertaining. The Quiet Pool is just on the other side of the lobby train stop. It is just that鈥?quite. It does have a bar with service, but the pool is there for folks who don鈥檛 want the noise and just relax. German (pronouncedERMAN) is the bartender. Great guy! Say hi from Mike and Mike (Miguel  Miguel) if you see him. And finally, don鈥檛 drink the tap water! If you do, you鈥檒l be out of commission for a good 24-48 hours. The ice, drinks, water in the restaurants, and bottled water are all fine. Also, the pool water is safe if you happen to swallow any.

<Content>Enjoyed the Bavaro Princess My wife and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess for 1 week to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. I think we made an excellent choice. We were a little nervous when we began to read some reviews after we had already booked our trip.After staying at the resort we can honestly say that the people who complain would have had problems with the Garden of Eden (because they weren鈥檛 allowed to eat the apples).The resort is beautiful and the staff is very nice. Any of the little problems we had (some mentioned in other reviews) only adds to the resorts charm. We had no problem with the restaurants they are excellent. The beach and pools are great. We enjoyed all of the shows, the performers work very hard to put on a fun show.We enjoyed the drinks. They are good. All in all we had a great time and would go back tomorrow. Enjoy your trip!Massachusetts U.S.A.

<Content>Great trip!!! I just returned from a week long trip to the Bavaro Princess, and have virtually nothing negative to say. I had read the negative reviews on this resort prior to leaving for my trip, and was a little worried. But once there, I realized that I could disregard the negativity. This resort provides a different experience than one would expect in a North American resort, but if you go with an open mind (and a little extra patience), you will have an enjoyable trip!!!RECEPTION:This was the only area that I feel could be improved. It was a little slow to check in. Also, we arrived around 1pm, and our rooms weren't ready until 3pm which was a little frustrating. But no biggie really.ROOMS:No complaints here. The suites were spacious and clean. Housekeeping came every day and replenished towels, washcloths, beach towels, etc.Water pressure in the showers was a little light, but the temperature was always as hot or cold as desired.BEACH:Great beach!!! White sand, light blue water. Had a mixture of calm water and waves during the week I was there. Was great. Non-motorized water sports are included (snorkeling, boogie boards, etc.) and I rarely had to wait to use anything.ACTIVITIES:The night entertainment wasn't phenomenal, but the atmosphere more than made up for it. There is the opportunity to leave the resort to go to discos, but I never did that, so I can't comment on those. But I did hear that drinks were expensive there.FOOD:So-so. Best I've had at a caribbean resort, but not what the typical North American is used to. Good selection though. The beef wasn't too great ... very chewy. But the fruit selection was wonderful!!!!PLATINIUM CLUB:Our travel deal included an upgrade to Platinum, and if I were to return, I would do this again. The little perks that it provides are well worth the little extra cost. Among other things, these rooms are located right at the beach, free massage, free internet, room service is free and premium liquor are all included.

<Content>Best vacation ever! I went to Bavaro Princess the week of May 5-12 with a group of family members. After reading some of the negative reviews, I was a little nervous, but once we arrived, everything went smoothly for the most part. The only glitch was that our room key did not work the first time. We informed the maid who radioed to someone and everything was fixed in under 5 minutes. After that, paradise!! The room was great (we stayed in building 11)! It was spotless with no odor whatsoever. We did not have any mosquitoes or other bugs that some people mentioned in other reviews. We had plenty of towels except for one day, when it rained. We called to the front desk and our towels arrived quickly. The people that we met and dealt with were all very friendly and accomodating. The resort itself was beautiful. The beach was very clean. The pool was great and it wasn't difficult to get a drink at the swim up bar most times. The bartenders, especially Reuben, were pretty entertaining despite the language barrier. No complaints from our group.The food was very good at each of the restaurants we went to. We only had bad service one night and that was at El Pescador. We had the misfortune of being there at the same time as a wedding. The food was delicious- it just took a long time to get to us. Other than that, no problems at all.If you book through Apple Vacations, definitely go to the meeting they tell you about when you arrive. There is a lot of useful information provided.The only downside to the resort is the lack of nightlife. The pools closed early (7:00 I think). The shows were not good at all. The bars all closed early as well. I heard the disco was fun, but I did not make it there.Overall it was an incredible vacation!! My cousins and I can't wait to go back. I definitely would recommend Bavaro Princess to anyone wanting to go on a relaxing getaway.If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them. Please contact me at: thesportsnut@hotmail.com

<Content>Perfect Holiday! My boyfriend and I have just returned from a weeks holiday at the Bavaro Princess and we can honestly say that it was a fantastic holiday.We booked a great deal through Thomsons and would highly recommend them. We travelled on Thomson Fly which was very comfortable, we didnt experience any delays and were greeted at Punta Cana airport by the resort rep who was very personable and efficient. The airport can only be described as a hut with a thatched roof!. On arrival, we were greeted by a steel band and all had our photographs taken with two ladies in the traditional dress (these were then displayed for you to purchase on your return flight).The resort was great. It is very large and so they have a courtesy bus which takes you around the resort, which is great when you want to rest your feet or when it rains!.The weather was perfect - clear blue skies every day, between 32-36 degrees each day and only rained once for an hour during dinner.The resort is extremely well maintained and there are always lots of staff around to empty the bins, water the gardens etc... We found all of the staff from the check in to the maintenance guys to be very friendly, always smiling and greeting you with a Hola!. Some of them speak very little English but they do try, it is nice if you can at least try and speak a little Spanish and they seem to really appreciate it.The food was brilliant - plenty of variety. There is a main buffet restaurant called Hispanola which we ate in most nights. They theme it every day so there is always something different, there was a Mexican night, Spanish, French etc.... There are also a number of alternatives which is great if you fancy a change of scenery, these are A la carte and must be pre booked. We ate in Satura (Asian cuisine) and the Seafood restaurant and although the food was lovely, the service tended to be a little slow and we actually found the waiting staff in the Hispanola to be more pleasant.Our room was lovely and it did not smell at all as some people have commented. It was very spacious and had a lovely balcony area which was lovely to sit out on in the evening before dinner. The room was serviced daily, although most days not until 4/5 pm. However, if you prefer your room to be cleaned at a certain time, you can request this with Guest Services. Our room was always immaculate and the mini bar is stocked every day, there is usually 2x cokes, 2x sprite, 2x waters and 2x beers.We were lucky enough to have a room close to the beach, I did ask for this on check in and they were more than happy to allocate us (we didnt have to pay premier prices either).There are two pools - a small, quiet pool close to the lobby which is ideal if you want to be the only one in the pool!. We tended to spend most of our time around the main pool or on the beach. We never struggled to find a sun lounger and there were plenty of trees and huts around so that you could get some shade.The entertainment staff (animacion team) were all great and funny. They work very hard, there was always something happening at the main pool or on the beach such as Merengue lessons, volleyball, Aqua aerobics and there is no pressure to join in. If you want to just sit and read a book, then they will leave you alone.We only managed to see one show in the evening which was very good, they do like to involve the audience, but again, we never felt under any pressure to take part.I find it quite sad that people have commented about having to pay $10 on arrival and $20 on departure, if you can afford a holiday then surely this will not break the bank? please remember that it is a developing Country afterall.All in all, we had a fantastic time, the resort was a very high standard, good quality and variety of food, staff were very friendly and we would not hesitate to return to this resort in the future - go open-minded, relax and have a great time!.

<Content>Loved it We loved our resort. The place was so big that you actually have to take a trolley around to get to the lobby. The beach was absoulutly amazing. The staff was so nice and even though there was somewhat of a language barrier they did know enough english to answer your questions. We booked through Apple Vacations which I highly recommend because I meet a couple that booked there vacation themselves and nothing was organized for them. When you book through apple transportation is included so you dont have any worrys. It is a thrid world country so do not wonder out of you restort. Bavaro beach is beautiful, the water is turquiose and just b reath taking with the white sandy beaches to match. Our room was huge and very clean but the food was just ok. Brush you teeth with bottled water only, you will get sick otherwise no matter what they tell you.

<Content>Had a GrEAT Time! me and my girlfriend just got back and we had a great time. i'm not sure why there were alot of bad reviews. the airport-- wow, its made of sticks and if the wind blows to hard its going to fall down. arriving at the airport you are greeted with a photo opp (pretty cheesy) and then you are hit with a $10 visitor fee. you wind your way through customs (which is a joke) to the tour group area to catch a ride to your hotel. i DO NOT suggest PRIETO TOURS!! although we got to the hotel in one piece, we almost missed our return flight because they forgot to pick us up!! oh yeah, and you definitely need to be at the airport 2 hours early because we waited in line for an hour for our tickets. security was a joke fyi.the drive to the hotel -- apparently you can drive on either side of the road and go as fast or as slow as you want. the road is bumpy and if you're driver is crazy hold on, its going to be interesting.the hotel -- the staff was excellent, very friendly, always saying hello and smiling. the property is huge and for the size of well-maintained. the important people such as, check-in, guest services, etc. speak some english but mainly i couldnt understand a damn word they said. our room was huge and very clean, ac worked great, water pressure could be better. mini fridge with 2 cokes, 2 diet cokes, 2 beers, 2 sprites and 2 waters filled every day. the gift shops sucked and way overpriced ($18 for sunscreen). stop by and feed the turtles on mangrove bridge, yoiu wiill be amazed how many come flocking to you, we also fed the parrots. our room didnt smell as other reviews had said. overall it was great! the food -- every day they had a different theme such as oriental buffett, spanish buffett..etc.. we found all the food to be pretty good, really no complaints at all about the food. we also ate a chopin which is another buffett and it was good too. the drinks could have been stronger but oh well.shopping--well all the little shops are the same and frankly its a hassle. we walked out of our resort and before we even crossed the street we had people after us to come in their shop. they are freakin annoying let me tell you. its not enough to be hassled on the beach by people trying to sell you stuff but it never ends over there. thats the one thing we hated. we went on vacation to relax and not be bothered but that didn't happen. ps. dont overpay for anything there!!the casino -- its a joke! its very small and frankly being in the dominican i think all the games are rigged even worse than vegas.definitely had a good time but maui is still tops

<Content>Will Never Return I have been to several other Caribbean locations: Bahamas, Jamaica, St. Lucia, Grand Cayman, etc. so I had high hopes for the Bavaro Princess. Instead, I was greeted with a really awful honeymoon suite which was no different from a normal room except it had a jucuzzi tub that wouldn't drain after we used it, hotel employees who spoke no English and were hard to communicate with, bad food, and ended up coming down with an illness that put me in the ER the day after my return. We ended up asking to be moved out of our supposedly better honeymoon suite to a regular room closer to the water that was at least redecorated and seemed cleaner than our other room. The resort itself is beautiful-- with peacocks, flamingos roaming the grounds and a lovely beach. However, very few rooms (a handful) are within site of the beach and there were no 24 hour places you could get food because all the beach restaurants are closed. My husband was starving at 5:00 one day and there was no where to get food-- unless you buy chips or stuff in the overpriced convenience store. The food, especially at the breakfast and lunch buffets is severely substandard and even though I was careful not to drink any of the tap water, I came down with a horrible stomach illness. When we got massages, the employees don't leave the room for you to undress and there is no modesty with a sheet or towel the way it normally is when you get massages. The masseuse even started taking my husband's shirt off him when we both hesitated to get naked in front of two strangers. The massages are NOT worth the money, so I wouldn't waste your time or dollars. I also was charged $5 US for 4 Rolaids in the resort store when my stomach was hurting so badly. Most of the employees were very nice and friendly, but the fact that the vast majority of them don't speak English, it is hard to communicate and get points across.  It is a beautiful place and much less expensive, which is why we took the risk. But, after having our experience, we would recommend you save up and go to a more sophisticated, professional resort elsewhere.

<Content>Wedding at Bavaro Princess I have to start by first saying the resort is beautiful! The beach is amazing and so is the water.My husband and I did go down to Punta Cana to get married.Let me say very stressful experience. The wedding coordinator Francelia is a very nice lady by as a coordinator did not do a good job. I booked our vacation eight months prior to going. We were given a wedding time of 8am with subject to change. I made many attempts to get our wedding time to no avail. I didn't find out my wedding time until 24 hours before the event. Imagaine have 27 guests asking when is the wedding and not knowing! As the resort did have a fire in March we had booked our wedding dinner at a neighbouring resort. Which I had an email from Francelia saying it is booked. In our room the day we arrived we did receive a greating from the wedding coordinator with details that we would meet her and then the photographer. We did meet with her. We discussed the flowers, wedding time, and the meal. Still no time. Dinner she let us know could not be book at another resort since our party was too big! I had an email from her saying it was booked! Very frustrating. I should have taken it with me. Still no wedding time.The wedding time ended up being 6pm. My wedding day poured! So instead of being at the gazebo we had it in the lobby. Still a very nice setting. The wedding ceremony was not until 6:45pm as Dominican time. Waiting for the cart. The cermony was quick, can't remember the caribbean trio. Very beautiful. Francelia did our ceremony as in the day we signed our documents with the judge in the afternoon. We then had champagne which was a nice touch. We had our photos taken over looking Licey. Nice setting. As the ceremony was late the photos started to get quite dark. Still looked good. My husband and I dedcided that we would later in the week have our pictures done on the beach. I met another bride and they too had got married during the week and then had pictures redone on another day. She used the photographer. We decided to have friends do that for us.We booked our wedding dinner at El Prescador. Annoying manager. Francelia let me know we would have the whole dinning room. Not true. As this was a wedding dinner we had name cards. When we requested moving tables the manager hit the roof! They had a set up of three tables two large and one small. I'm the bride and can't move tables. Really poor service there. The meal was pretty good. Service really slow. I really enjoyed my experience at the Bavaro Princess I want other brides to be aware that there may be hiccups with the planning. After the ceremony you are so happy that you do forget all the details but I want others to be aware.Beach - beautiful. Always enough seating. The beach went for a couple of km's each way. Bars - there was one the beach and one at the pool. The drinks at the pool tasted way better. Maximo was the bar tender. Nice guy. Service can be slow. Sometimes only one bartender. We brought oversized mugs so our trips were less. Coco loco very good. Pina coladas excellent and Miami vice - tasty.Room - really nice room. Neat set up. No smell in our room.Cart - very useful. You really need to wear comfortable shoes since you do a lot of walking.Grounds - very well kept. Beautiful. Really nice to see flamincos and peacocks on the grounds.Photos - on the beach / pool the photographer goes around with somekind of animal or personality. These cost $10 and are really good quality photos. There are posted outside the lobby within hours of being taken.FoodEl Prescador - set menu for our wedding - Lobster and Seafood platter. Service - slowChopin - a la carte - not as good as the main buffet. Not bad.Sakura - as we had a large group they brought us pre selected starters which was nice. Food not bad. Good service.Licey - really beautiful setting. We had a coupon with the wedding. When we went it was at 9:30pm. So service was excellent. We had three waiters. Food was good. Don't think it is worth paying though.Hispanola - very good for breakfast and dinner. Never went for lunch. Always a good selection. I am a dessert person and on one night I was dissapointed. Though they have a lot of selection.Service / lobby - excellent. All spoke good english. Went for change, new key card, bought a cake for one dinner since it was one of our guests birthdays (no problems), bookings for restaurants, questions for wedding. Excellent service.Shopping - apparently this is cheaper for rum than the airport! Didn't buy anything. On the beach - watch out for banana leaf cigars!Trip - we did go on one day trip - Saona island. Excellent trip. $85 per person. Bus ride out there you pick up other resort visitors so your ride is the longest. You have a speed boat trip out to visit the island. Spend about three hours there. Beautiful island. Had lunch which was nice. Mamaguana. Deadly. Many of our guests had this and they were quite drunk! We took our snokeling gear. Not too much to see there. We then had the catamaran trip back. Really fun. Don't wear shoes on the catamaran you will get in trouble! They play music on the trip back and have two waitresses who get the guests dancing. It was a lot of fun!Overall really great trip. We will go to another island next. Been to Punta Cana, Puerto Plata and Holguin - Cuba. Next island maybe St. Lucia.Our guests there were hiccups - cards not working, one persons luggage did go to the wrong room. Some had mildew in theirs rooms. Bring candles. Someone had items stolen from there case from Toronto to the Punta Cana airport (ipod, camera charger, CD player). We think it happend in TO so lock your case.Make sure you have no toiletrees in your carry on or drinks. The airport will take these even if sealed water. This applies both ways!Any questions please email me.

<Content>Don't Be scared off by bad reviews!! Just returned from the Bavaro Princess on the 12th and I can't believe some of these bad reviews. I have traveled to many islands in the Carribean and this was my second time to Punta Cana. The first time my husband and I stayed at Secrets Excellence. The Bavaro Princess is a beautiful resort employing wonderful people. I did not meet one person who did not go out of their way to greet us, even if it was in their native language of Spanish. The people who need to speak English can, maybe not as well as us, but I can speak Spanish as well as them. The service in the restaurants is a little slow, but the reason we go to these places it to be on island time, right! The food was not bad, I've learned from my trips to the Carribean what I can and can't eat. I can not touch the beef on any of these islands, it is not the food itself that is bad, it is just not what my American stomach is used to, so I stick with what I can eat and there are plenty of choices. As for saving chairs at 6am to lose them by 7am, it clearly states in the directory that saving chairs is not allowed and any unattended chairs left for more than 30 minutes can be taken over by someone else. So you see, no need to call the police. I didn't have a problem finding chairs on the beach or the pool deck, some people just want a prime spot all of the time, not very realistic. The rooms were beautiful, much larger than average and I love the arrangement. Maid service was excellent, they couldn't do enough for us. Landscaping was also excellent, I don't think they ever stopped working. Platinum Club was definitely worth it, location of rooms alone was a big plus. We were right next to the beach. All of the people working in the plantinum lounge were also wonderful and their English was very good. Guess what though, I tried to learn as much Spanish as I could while I was there, even simple things like hello and how are you. The staff really appreciate it when you try and they are more than willing to help you learn. Maybe that is why I recieved better treatment, I showed and interest in learning to better communicate with them. Didn't mean to go on this long, I just get tired of listening to the spoiled Americans whine about how terrible their trip to a third world country was, be realistic, you are going for the beach, the relaxation and the experience. If you are looking for gourmet food and a true 5 star hotel, there are plenty of those right here in New York , although, you may not find many people speaking English there either. One last thing, my trip to Secrets Excellence cost twice as much as this one and the resort was beautiful and the food a little better, but I would definitely go back to the Bavaro Princess. Any questions, please feel free to email me.

<Content>Gorgeous! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess the week of May 7th. The grounds were gorgeous, and the beach was spectacular. However, the resort is seated on about 92 acres, so there is ALOT of walking involved. Bring comfortable shoes. Also, men, bring long pants, as they will not allow you into the majority of the restaurants w/o long pants (they make no exceptions). Our room was huge, however, there were little bugs in it, and we woke up each morning with a few more bug bites then we had before we went to sleep. Also, there is low water pressure, and no washcloths. Those are the few complaints that I have, but for the price that we paid for the vacation, I was very pleased with our accomadations. The staff was very friendly, and always at our service, the bartenders were also very fun people. The hotel was clean, as were the pool and the beach. For all of the bad reviews that I have read on here, I do no think there is all that much to complain about. Punta Cana is like Paradise, you are there to have fun and enjoy your trip, there may be little things that annoy you, but overall, I was incredibly satisfied with this trip.

<Content>stay away from bavaro princess I would not go back to punta cana or the bavaro princess. I traveled with 2 other couples and we all felt the same. First off as soon as you get off the plane they charge you $10/person as a visitor fee at the airport. We went platinum and it was definetly not worth the extra money. Check in was supposed to be easy however there wasnt anyone there to direct us where to check in so we waited in line for the general checkin only to be told we where at the wrong place and had to chatch the golf cart to take us to the platinum lounge for checkin. The so called lounge had a table with some bottles of top-shelf liquor and 2 types of american beer, no music and no atmosphere. Room was average with no bugs but could have used a paint job. They had 3 types of liquor which was not top shelf, more like bottom shelf local liquor. No ice machines to make drinks even if you wanted. The beer in the room was average. The pool was decent however dont expect to have cocktail waitresses coming around taking your order and it is difficult to get a drink at the bar since the had only 1 bartender at a time. They ran out of top shelf liquor at the pool bar and at the beach bar. They also ran out of ice for an entire day, yes, that's right they didnt have ice. To get to any restaurants or to the casino it was an ordeal as everything is spread out. The grounds were well kept though. The food was below average and severeal people got sick from our group even though we didnt drink the water. Most employees spoke little to no english so trying to find out what was going on was next to impossible. The shows that they had were a complete joke and not worth going to. There was nothing to do after dinner, no where to go and relax and listen to decent music. The music there was not good either. Forgot to mention that the service in the restaurants was horrible, took 1 hour to get served at the seafood restaurant and the food was not worth the wait. The so-called best rest.licey wasnt all its cracked up to be.The only thing positive I liked was relaxing by the ocean. I would never go back.

<Content>Great Honeymoon My husband and I spent a week at the Bavaro Princess in April for our honeymoon, and we had a wonderful time. We stayed in the honeymoon suite and it was beautiful. We were both glad that we upgraded to the honeymoon package because of all the extras that it came with. It was totally worth it!The food was amazing! We had their chicken almost everyday. And we both found that you did not have to add salt or pepper to anything. My husband is a really picky eater, and he really enjoyed the food, and was even willing to try things that he would not have tried at home. The service at the hotel was also amazing. Some of the people could not speak very good English, but everyone that needed to speak English did. The service at the restaurants was great, they let you take your time, and always have a friendly face. We also found that the fire did not effect the wait times for eating. They did however get rid of their Italian restaurant, which was disappointing, but there were still lots of places to eat that we enjoyed. While we were there we went on the Outback Safari, and the Caribbean Tour. Both were fun and well worth the money. (About $80 American each)Over all we had a good week, and I think the fact that we did not let the little things bother us, and we remembered that we are on vacation contributed to this decision.

<Content>Some great stuff, some horrible!!! This was a beautiful setting for our daughters wedding. However, there were just too many negatives to bring our family and friends back to this resort any time soon. We went as a group of 37, and the trip started out on a very sour note. Most of our group (and many many others) were given room keys that did not open the doors to our rooms. Keep in mind it is a fairly long walk between most rooms and the lobby. When the keys didn't work, we walked back to the lobby, waited in line, and then were told to come back in 10 minutes, when the problem would be fixed.This is where we first learned of a term some people might refer to as Dominican Time, where come back in 10 minutes can often mean, we don't really know what time you should come back. I suppose an hour or so later we were given re-programmed keys. Off we went back to our rooms, where we discovered that our newly programmed keys still didn't work. This occurred 3 or 4 times to most of our group. Basically our first day from 3 pm until bed time was spent walking back and forth, trying re-programmed keys, and waiting to get into our rooms so that we could access our belongings and use facilities. We SHOULD have been spending this time enjoying the start to our vacation.Most of our group got into their rooms by getting staff on the grounds (maids, security etc,) to use their master keys to let them in. When I look back on it, just about anyone could have gotten into any room they wanted. Staff on the grounds had no idea whether or not they were allowing people into the correct room. Luckily for all involved, most people are generally honest. Can you imagine if there was just 1 thief among all those people. Jackpot!!! I can get into any room I want. I just have to flag down security personnel. They'll let me in. Just a little ironic.Some of our group finally gave up trying to get a key the first night. Once in their room and after the 3rd or 4th attempt, they just stayed there to avoid the grief. HOW VERY SAD.I spoke to hotel management about the problem the next day, and mentioned how I thought that this was totally un-acceptable. Some people still had no working keys. The hotel had all of our money (charter vacation) and we had no recourse. 1 day and evening out of a seven day vacation is a lot of time to spend trying to solve an significant issue, and some were still waiting. I mentioned that to him, and suggested that as an act of good-will, the hotel SHOULD try to do more for us than just say I'm Sorry Sir. I suggested that maybe a dinner at the $25 per person restaurant on the house might be appropriate for our group, given the cost of the lost first day. (Average room costs about $150US PP?) He offerred ME a massage in the spa. Just me! A lot of good that would do for a group of 37. I declined, and realized they were not interested in really trying to make it right.My daughter and soon to be son-in-law had a problem with their room. On the day after our arrival, staff allowed them to move to a different room. Because they were the couple to be married, they were told don't worry, we'll move all your belongings. Go enjoy the facilities. Your new room will be ready in an hour. When they arrived in their new room, they could not find their return plane tickets. They had left them on the table in their old room (they had shown more trust in the staff than I would have). Time to panic. Back to the lobby and a wait in line. They were brought back to their old room and along with staff, searched and found nothing. My future son-in-law suggested they speak with the maids, since someone had obviously re-made the room. Lo-and-behold, they found the maid, went through the garbage on her rolling cart, and found their tickets. WOW! Again we get I'm sorry sir! We saw this as another 2 or 3 hours of time wasted running around. The extra stress of lost plane tickets added to the lost time issue. By now you get the general drift. We were not happy whatsoever with how the hotel staff managed our problems. They sorely lacked in customer relations.To be fair, I'll move on to a few of the more positives things.Beach and pool areas were more than acceptable for this rating.Food was mixed. About what you'd expect. nothing spectacular, but for the most part, at least good.Service was terrible in the sea-food a-la-carte, and fantastic in the Asian. You would honestly think that you were in 2 vastly different resorts, there was that much of a difference in service.We enjoyed lunch on the beach. It saved us a long walk back to the lobby and the buffet. The food at the beach BBQ was pretty darn tasty. The wedding was, as previously mentioned, in a beautiful setting. Really the highlight of the trip. (I may be biased on this one however, being the father of the bride.) The wedding pictures and DVD (extra cost) were stunning. Kudos to the staff of the photo shop.A destination wedding is something everyone should AT LEAST consider. I've heard many stories of how a lot of people have a hard time handling some of the stresses involved in planning a more traditional wedding. This was our first child getting married, and really, except for a few anxious moments related to the wedding, it was all so serene, peaceful and quite beautiful.Even with the beautiful wedding, I will be contacting both the resort and my travel agent to express my disappointment with how our issues were handled.

<Content>5-star resort with 1-star clientelle We stayed at the Bavaro Princess May 1-8, 2007 and it was the first all-inc experience I had.The GoodFirst off, I must say that the landscape and gardens of this resort was gorgeous. Lush vegitation, palm trees, parrots and peacocks roaming freely made each walk to the beach like a trip through a tropical forrest. Our hotel room was about a 5-minute walk from the beach, they also have a trolly for the lazy people that drives to the beach every few minutes.The Staff were on the most part very friendly, there were a few guys who were rude but most were exceptionally friendly. The room was okay, not comparable to the 4 or 5-star hotels here in Canada but it's to be expected. The beach was perfect, nicer than any other I've seen. There were always chairs available, however we had to get up there before 8am to grab one under the shade each day. There were 2 restaurants that had terrific food (El Pescador and Sakura), I would be happy eating in either restaurant all week. I highly recommend the grilled lobster.The Not-so-GoodThe buffet restaurant, for whatever reason, never seemed to have even moderately-warm food. While we were never sick, the food at breakfast was never enjoyable (save for the fruit) and always cold, and the nights we had dinner there we found little that interested us, and again most of the food was cold.Also, while no fault of the resort, there were usually long lineups at the bars. Sometimes the bartenders would ignore you to serve those waiving dollar bills, and the beer was very watered down. The place was very busy, the crowd for the most part seemed to be composed of ignorant americans who didn't know how to act in public. For a five-star resort there were lots of annoying frat-boy thug types and obnoxious, rude classless americans who treated staff like garbage.It was also very expensive, the same box of RJ cigars that my gf picked up in Cuba for 25$ was 200$ here. For a 750ml bottle of the local rum it was 25$. Even tacky souveniours were way overpriced, even by Western standards.The final complaint was the mosquitoes. I look like I came back from a camping trip rather than a beach vacation. This was especially annoying at some of the restaurants located near ponds, as the restaurants have no walls the mosquitoes are numerous. In fact, we had to cut a few meals short due to being eaten alive. Bring lots of repellant!Overall, a beautiful resort well worth the money run by energetic and friendly staff. While I would probably not return myself (would rather go to Cuba or Jamaica), I do recommend this place. Many of the things I complained about could have been due to the time of our trip and not necessarily the resort itself.

<Content>Great Vacation!!! Detailed Review!!! I just got back from Bavaro Princess today (May 8th) and for being my first tropical vacation...it was awesome!!!!!! Being my first vacation, I do not have a lot to compare to, however I have read all the latest reviews over the past 5 months and I had a pretty good idea going in about what to consider poor versus excellent in terms of the resorts and its services...and all together this resort was well above average and I would recommend it to those who are not sticklers for absolute perfection, but for those who want to relax and have a good time regardless of little problems that may arise!!! After reading all of the reviews I was worried, but this hotel holds over 2500 guests each night....there are only maybe 800 reviews on here from the past 3 years...so take the reviews for what they are worth!!! Yes things come up that may not make u happy, but a vacation is what you make of it and this resort gives you the opportunity to make your vacation excellent! I know most reviews don't go into much detail so I will try to.Beach: Absolutely beautiful...white sand and clear aqua ocean...what more can you ask for!!! You can snorkel and see fish in the water without being over your head so it can still be exciting for those who aren't strong swimmers (lots of pretty angel fish and minnows so don't be frightened !!)...there are many motor sports to do such as parasailing and banana boats (i didnt do any of these but they looked like great fun!!!) and kayaking and windsurfing were all available. There aren't enough of those grass huts for most ppl, however there are plenty of chairs to go around!! I found it nice to not have to worry about getting a hut becuz i enjoyed having my chair close to the water with the nice breeze and ocean to jump into only 5 feet away. There were a couple bars on the beach and one (Cafe Del Mar) had all of the booze and machines to make 99% of the drinks and also offered lunch/snack every day from 10-4 while the beach restaurants are being rebuilt (lunch included nachos, potatoes, corn, hots and hams, chicken, steak pork etc) all of which were good. The beach also has a lot of vendors on it...NONE of them harass you!!! They walk by and offer but a simple shake of the head and they will leave you alone and there is security on the beach so there is no reason to feel threatened. Restaurants: The beach restaurants being burnt down didnt have a big impact on us...they are making great progress on it and I am sure it will be open in June being that 75% of the framework and foundation is now complete. For breakfast we ate at the main buffet in the lobby (Hispanola) and Chopin, both which offered omelets, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, french toast, pancakes, yogourt, cereal etc etc so there is always something for everyone!!! Chopin is located in the middle of the resort so its nice for those who are at the back of the resort. I never ate lunch at either but I know they had lunch meat and things to make sandwiches and lots of fruit. The only food I was concerned about eating was the lunch meat because I am a stickler for that kind of food spoiling easily but if ur concerned, DONT EAT IT!! its as simple as that!!! it didn;t limit my options at all and as I already mentoned, cafe del mar offered great food for lunch!! As for the a la cartes, we only ate at El Pescador the seafood restaurant and we both had lobster, calamari and shrimp, all of which were delicious!! It was easy to get reservations at the a la cartes even tho they were limited in size because of the fire, it didn't affect us at all and there were 5 other restaurants available at other princess hotels and the hotel offered reservations and transportation for these retaurants so with all of the options and 9 a la cartes,,,there is tons to choose from!!!! We ate at Hispanola for all other dinners and it was great!! They offer a theme for every night (Italian, American, Mexican, Spanish, Dominican, International, Oriental) so with all of the themes it wasn't necessary to travel to a la cartes because most of the options were brought to the buffet a long with favourites for each theme such as fajitas or even philly cheese steak sandwiches which were delicious!!!! There was always pasta, vegetable, potato, salad, desert. and meat dishes available, always changing so it was never boring. There was also an american stand every night with pizza and hotdogs and hamburgers, fries, even mcdonalds chicken mcnuggets one night as they too change a few dishes each night such as roast beef or ribs!!! they also offers meats cooked fresh in front of you like salmon, chicken, steak and pork if you would prefer your food cooked the way you like it. People complain that the food is cold but it isnt!!!!!!!!!! This hotel has NO WALLS except for in your rooms. At night there is a beautiful breeze which all appreciate after a humid day and it takes a few minutes to circulate the buffet so by the time you sit down, YES your food is cold!!! but its not because it has been sitting out all night because the chefs change the dishes all of the time and there are heat lamps for hot foods and ice for cold foods...so the best way to work the buffet is to take a walk around and see what there is to offer and then go and get a little bit of food and come back for seconds...you will enjoy your meal more if you gawk at the food first and then fill your plate after you know what is available becuz u can make it to your table and eat a lot faster while your food is hot, and its a buffet so go back for seconds if you dont have enough room on your plate!!! also, the main buffet offered snack from midnight to 7am!!! Some days i didnt feel like much for dinner after a hot day in the sun, but by midnight I was famished so this was great!! this offered fruits, hotdogs and hamburgers, pizza, chicken wings, fries...that sort of thing....not a lot of variety but its 12a,-7am...there isnt a full staff to keep up a full buffet so it is enough to keep you satisfied!!! The buffet wait staff is quick to your table just moments after you are seated with ice water and any drink of choice, which are brought to you very quickly with a smile!!! I felt that the food was very good and wouldn't expect anything more. There was tons to choose from and it was tastey so please don't let food be the reason for not choosing this resort!!!Rooms: Very nice! We were in a suite and had a very clean room with a nice patio to sit on every day. The maids cleaned the rooms fairly well and swept and mopped out all of the sand which you cant help but bring in every day!!! Lots of fresh towels and soda and beer was given in our rooms and even when the maid forgot the bath towels the one day we were there...we called guest services and the towels were brought to us within minutes. Sometimes the maids just simply run out of linen and with such a spread out resort, they sometimes forget to go back to the room to load up on what they didnt have on their cart when they cleaned it...so dont take it personally if you don''t get all of your amenities because guest services will fix it for you in no time at all...and they even call back to make sure you got what you needed about an hour after you ask for something!!! the rooms are huge and feel like little apartments which my boyfriend and i loved!!! There was also a tv in all rooms...now I know most ppl don't go on vacation to watch tv, but there are times when you just need to lay down and rest so having a tv was nice and there are plenty of great channels from home that you get in english so that is another bonus for those days when you get too much sun and just want to lay in bed for an hour or two before dinner!! There was AC in our room and we had control of it which was excellent!! It was usually too cold in our room even with 90 degree weather outside so it was nice to have the control to keep the room comfortable. The water pressure in the room was FINE!!! give me a break to those who complain!! dont expect great pressure being as there are 800 rooms and fountains coming out the wazoo but there is enough to take a great shower, even during peak hours!!! I never found it a problem and with a sunburn, who wants hot water pounding you in the back?? certainly not me!!! We did find a roach in our bathroom one day due to a crack in the wall beside the tub but whatever...i have found a roach in my apartment at home so its not surprising!! there are lots of misquitoes tho so bring lots of bug spray!!!Pool: Beautiful pool with a swimup bar...but we never even got near it because the beach is right there!!! I didnt go to punta cana to swim in a pool!!!Transportation: The trains run all through the resort so the size of the park is not a problem!!! The trains take from 2 minutes to 15 depending on how busy the resort is. my advice is to be waiting for the trains earlier that usual if you have somewhere important to be on time (like an excursion) because with the trains not being always on time, you dont want it to be a reason to miss your excursion!!! The drivers can drive fast but its fun!! there is no danger because they are not going a Nascar speed but its fun and you get a great breeze!!! During the end of the week the trains were going sooo slow and it was a pain cuz they took forever to come...most likely due to ppl complainging about the speed..but they DONT go that fast!!!! your in a moving vehicle so hold on to the many rails and enjoy the ride!!! complaining makes walking faster than the trains sometimes!!!!Casino: very small with the disco but it is fun and even tho its only a 2 minute walk from the lobby, there is a train available anyways that will pick you up and drop you off whenever you are ready! I was also lucky at this casino which was another bonus!!Lobby: the bars offered tons of drinks, many which arent on the menu so dont be affraid to ask!!! If you see others with fun looking drinks, ask them!!!! This is how we came to find some of your favourite drinks!! There is tons of booze available all inclusive so platinum is not needed unless you cant live without jack daniels or baileys!!!! Dont waste your money on the upgrade for drinking purposes because it is not necessary!!! The beer and liquor is also NOT watered down!!! they add extra if you want it so why the heck would they water it down?? !!! Coco Locos, Bahama Mamas and Bavaro Princesses are just a few of the great drinks they have!! The presedente is DELICIOUS!!! i am a picky beer drinker but this beer is yum so enjoy it if you like a lighter beer like myself...its not light but it has that flavour like Coors Light. The night life isnt much but they offer some fun shows! Everynight there is a kids show and then the male dancers come out for a quick dance before the audience gets involved with some fun activities on stage before the actual shows....these activities consist of little games with prizes so very fun to participate in or just watch!! but if you dont want to be asked to participate, dont sit at the front!!! But they do accept the word no if you really dont want to go up and they ask you so that isnt a problem. The actual shows consisted of dancing in beautiful costumes to merengue and salsa music, comedy acts or even the Lion King which was AWESOME!!! they even had kids visiting dress up and take part in the play so it is great for those who are thinking of bringing there kids. None of the acts were inappropriate and most of them were cheesy but hey, they try so hard every single night that you appreciate it so just remember that this isnt broadway or vegas, and enjoy it!!! After the shows there is often a live band and dancing where the dancers will get the guests up and dancing...even if you dont know the dance they got you up and moving which was great fun especially after a few pina coladas...we didnt dance well but we did laugh a lot!! If you do get a chance, and you will, dance with a local staff member and they will teach you some great moves so you will fit in.Beach Activities: There was the Funtastic team or the beach boys and they guys were grreat!!!! There is a schedule of activities each day for the pool and beach from sports to dancing and although I didnt participate, I wish I would have!!! The Dancing lessons on the beach (merengue, salsa, and bachata) where hilarious to watch because the workers LOVE to dance so they are very into it...and they teach you dances that are done on stage at night so when guests are invited on stage, you already know the dance!!! There is also water aerobics or beach aerobics which are a RIOT to watch and participate in if you need to release some extra energy!!Tours: We went on the Jurassic Buggy excursion and Marinarium. First Jurassic Buggy was 70 US pp and this included a bus ride to a ranch where you and a partner get a dune buggy and get to ride through trails for about 2 1/2 hours!!! You stop at a beach that is gorgeous to wash off (this tour is muddy folks so dont wear anything nice!!) and then you head off again to an amazing cave gratto where you can jump in and rinse off the mud!! this wasnt advertised but it was awesome!!!! there is shopping available at this stop before you head back to the ranch where horses, bulls, cows and pigs all frollic amonst each other...it is so cute! You now get about 30 minutes of horse back riding which was great and then you head home!! This was a really fun excurision!!!Marinarium took us to a beautiful beach south of bavaro, closer to the caribbean sea where we snorkelled with nurse sharks and stingrays in an enclosed net!!! this was really amazing!!! there was lots of corals and tropical fish too!! and if you really feel like exploring, you can leave the nets and snorkel around the boat which was amazing!!! so many beautiful fish that arent in the nets and you can even feed them bread out of your hand!! Next you go to a natural pool where you enjoy some drinks and a snack and there is tons of music and dancing on the boat also with education about the ocean and the animals which you snorkel with! The excursion team on this tour was hilarious and showed us a great time!! This is a must for those who want to snorkel and are beginners (as I was). it was 78 US and well worth it!!Staff: The staff at the BP were truly nice!! The men speak much more english than the women due to their education in the dominican so they seem much more friendly!!! BUT the women are just as nice even though they can't carry on fluent conversations all of the time!! So dont take a funny look as being rude but more so as being sorry I dont understand! Those who do not speak good english tend to not have the jobs that involve much speaking, so pay attention to these people too!!! They really are nice and these people work 10-12 hours a day, 7 days a week for very litle money so if they are cranky, they have reason to be!!! but we never had a cranky staff member encounter!!! TIP THE STAFF!!! not many people do and although we didnt tip a lottt (like 50-75 bucks) it was a hell of a lot more than others did! A dollar here and there goes a long way, and pay attention to those who may not be in direct contact with you, but work around you. There are many ladies who clear the drinks and wipe the tables you sit at in the lobby but the bar tenders get teh tips 99% of the time...so give these ladies some money!! We even tipped the young guy sweeping the floor!!! Some of the smiles we got from those who werent in primary positions when we tipped them made us feel really good because we knew they appreciated it and we tried to make them feel appreciated!!! Dont worry about not knowing spanish either...we learned all we needed within the first day and we had no problems communicating!!!Oh yes, there are also a lot of pictures being taken on the resort! Parrots, Monkeys, Iguanas, men and women dressed in native dominican outfits, all travel the resort every day with a camera crew and take pictures of you with them, and these pictures are displayed in the lobby every day for you to purchase (10US). We had a good 15 pictures taken which was nice since we could view them before we bought them and if we didnt like them, we could get new ones taken the next day for free and see if we liked them!!! When driving through the city the drivers are crazy...at first you will fear for your life but dont worry lol they drive like this for a living so you get used to it quickly!!!ok so to wrap it up...all in all it was a great trip! The only downsides were a) we got sick for about 8 hours one afternoon due to a mixture of too much sun, too much rum, and sandwiches which we had OFF of the resort (our own fault!!) b) the luggage guys forgot our luggage when we were leaving the resort but luckily we noticed and they rushed back to get it for us (SO MAKE SURE UR LUGGAGE GETS ON THE BUS!!!) and c) the trip wasnt long enough!!!I hope this helps...

<Content>not bad All in all, this may sound like a bad review, but really, we had a great time. First of all, we booked this trip because it was a great deal. you get what you pay for. Our room smelled a bit musty and was a bit run down. This was not a big deal for us since we wanted to lay at the beach and relax for the week and we did not plan on hanging out in the room. We dealt with it, but day 2 of our trip, we found a cockroach. Staff was quick and immediately moved us to a different room. Boy, did that make a difference. Less musty and just a bit more updated. The only problem we had with the room was the low water pressure in the shower. Not a big deal.Positives: We have been to Punta Cana before and noticed that the food was better than the last resort. I've read several complaints regarding the food, but we actually enjoyed it and felt the buffet had a lot to offer. The specialty restaurants were decent and we also enjoyed them as well.There are 2 pools in the resort. The pool closest to the lobby was quiet and relaxing. If you are looking for more noise and loud music, the pool with the swim up bar would be the one for you. while the hotel is re-building the restaurant that burnt down, there was slight construction noises, but nothing that wasn't tolerable. Staff wasn't overly friendly nor rude. We had to flag staff down in the restaurants just to get a diet coke or juice. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and would recommend the resort to someone, but we wouldn't go back.

<Content>Not bad First the bad stuff: our shower had unacceptably bad water pressure.Like, barely dripping out. Unacceptable. Although for the rest of my review, I will generally give this place a good review, I cannot recommend a place that does not have its plumbing in order. It is an inexpensive place, but they are ranked a five star resort, so they should not have any showers like this. Therefore I must say, unless you get some sort of guarantee regarding water pressure in your room, do not book a stay here.My comments may not sound like I'm giving the place a glowing review.But we had a great time here. Keep in mind, despite the so-so nature of some of my comments, this place was CHEAP. US$1500 pp for all-inclusive INCLUDING AIRFARE! You just can't complain with prices that low (except about water pressure). We didn't mind paying an additional $200 (for a $1700 total) for the premium club package.We had the premium (Platinum) option. This allowed us use of a pleasant clubhouse. Too many kids were allowed to use the computers--this should stop. It was very handy to have our own private bar in the clubhouse--no lines! Also, I believe the Platinum club rooms are closest to the beach. We had a dream-worthy view of the ocean from our terrace. A few other perks, but the closeness to the beach, the clubhouse, and also private check-in were what made the Platinum package worth it.The grounds were nice and well maintained. The beach, being on the Bavaro section of P.C., was of course phenomenal. Our room was nice and clean. The lobby was a great place to hang out. I would have hung out there more, but we were in the complete opposite end of the resort.The staff was, for the most part, OK. Not super-friendly, but not rude certainly. There were of course many exceptions--several bartenders and other staff people were truly friendly. But, overall, I was not wowed by friendliness. To be clear: no one was unfriendly, just not exactly exuberant. Food was edible, and that is about all I can say about it. Very odd: in the buffets, the food was almost never hot. They don't know how touse sterno or something. Alcohol was watered down. Wine was very thin. The ala carte restaurants were just slightly better. Service was third world, to put it kindly (again, there were some very friendly exceptions). The premium restaurant (Licey, I think), where you are allowed to eat one night, was many many steps above the rest of the resort. Also, the Dominican restaurant in the Caribe Club Princess (just up the beach), which you can also go to, was much better than the international restaurants at the Bavaro Princess. For breakfast and lunch, the buffet at the restaurant adjacent to thelobby was a little better than the one close to the beach.The pool was quite large and nicely designed, although certainly not a place for meditation (lots of loud aerobics and other stuff going on there). It was nice to go from the beach to the pool, or vice versa.

<Content>good times!!! We stayed from April 13 to the 20th. Because of the bad reviews lately and the beach fire, we tried to change our decision the last minute, but with nothing else available, we decided to bite the bullet and just go with it. Let me tell you I am very glad that we did!! We had a great time. There was 4 of us, a younger crowd most would say, but it was nothing but good. The resort itself is beautiful. The workers work very hard at keeping it clean. It is very big,so it is nice to catch the tram, which are a blast to ride on. We stayed Platinum and it was very well worth it. The room was kept very clean, we did not see any big gross bugs or anything. Our fridge was always stocked. The AC worked which was a bonus because it is HOT there!!The showers werent the best at times, hardly any pressure. It just depended on what time your shower was at.And how many other people were doing the same thing at that same time.None of us got sick from the food. Keep in mind that they do not have food like what we have. Chances are if it looks different from what you are used to then it will taste a little different as well. We got a chance to eat at all of the a la carte's, for us the Asian place was the best. It was great and the service was great as well. We were very well looked after. The night life isnt so great, so went to the casino one night other than that we would take a 10 minute walk down the beach(which is amazing) to another resort that we had access to and sit at there beach bar all night. I would definalty go back here. I would reccommend a few other things. We did alot of the tours. We went horse backing riding which I dont think that I would do again. The horses dont listen very well becasue they only know spanish, so if you know spanish than you will be fine. The Outback Safari was a great trip!!!! Our tour guide Sammy was amazing. He knew alot and was really entertaining to boot. The driver Hector was great as well. Made the best Santo Libre's EVER!!The driving there is CRAZY! I was scared for my life many of times. Just to warn you. Saona Island was BEAUTIFUL!!!What a great day trip that was as well. They take you to a little island in the Caribeen Sea. We also went Quading. It was a blast, however we were stuck with about 15 people from Spain, and they were the rudest people I have ever met. I will never travel to Spain for that reason. Please keep in mind that you are in a third world country. You are in a 5 star hotel to them. Not at the damn Hilton. Keep that in mind then you wont be so let down. When shopping, bargin bargin bargin. Always go half of what they say then go from there. Everyone wants you go to into their store. Also it wouldnt hurt to learn a bit of spanish before you go. Its alot easier on you and them and they also appreciate it.It was a great time and we will be back!!!

<Content>Fabulous, can't wait to return. My 24 year old daughter and I went for from March 31 - April 7. We planned it so we had 8 FULL days there and it was still not enough. We are already planning our next trip back to the same resort, this time with more of her and my friends. I don't know where those people who wrote such negative reviews stayed, but it couldn't have been here. My only thought is that they would not have been happy anywhere. Our experience could not have been more pleasant. We did not upgrade and I don't think that it was necessary.The resort and the grounds were beautiful. Our room was wonderful - very clean,hot water and plenty of water pressure, restocked mini fridge and an awesome maid. The beach was beyond words - the most gorgeous I have ever seen - white sand, turqouise water and blue skies and palm trees. There was a fabulous beach bar, daily activites on the beach such as dance lessons, exercise class and games. Not far away was a fabulous pool with a swim up bar and water activites. If you prefer a smaller one, there is a lovely pool and beach bar closer to the main lobby. It is a large resort and has a wonderful train system that transports within as well as to other Princess resorts nearby, which you had all access to. However, it is not so large that it could not be walked. My daughter and I never rode the train. The food was fabulous - many different choices. There had been a fire, but they made up for it by offering other choices. The one thing that impressed me the most was the people who worked at the resort. They could not have been nicer or more friendly. They all spoke English, with the possible exception of the maids and grounds workers, but they were equally wonderful. One thing that we did do was take many dollar bills and $5's. Although it is all inclusive, these people work very hard and just a couple of dollars means alot. Tipping a dollar for a few drinks is not a big deal. We did get some bites, which I think was from the sand flies, since they were only on our legs. I don't know if bug spray would have prevented it, but taking some next time. All in all it was a fabulous week. We can't wait to go back and we are taking friends with us, AND we will be staying at the Bavaro Princess.

<Content>Not bad!!!!! My wife and I celebrated our 10 year anniversay at the Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort. We spent five nights in the Honeymoon Suite. We have no complaints about the accommodations. Our room was very nice and clean.There is good for here, but you have to seach for it. The buffet is good for breakfast and lunch. I hghly recommend making reservations at one of the restaurants for your dinners. If you only eat at the buffet, you will not enjoy your stay.This is a mega resort. It is very spread out. You will have to take a tram to get to many places. This can be a nuisance at times. Please keep in mind that not many of the suites have an ocean view. Our suite was literally about a mile from the beach.If you are one of those ugly Americans, you may not like this place. Please remember that you are in a third world country where Spanish is the national language. If you have no patience for repeating yourself or for not being understood, don't come here. The servers and bartenders speak very little English. When in Rome do as the Romans, try to speak Spanish they really appreciate the effort.Unfortunately, this resort allows timeshare representatives on the premises. Be prepared, you will be approached by them on a daily basis. Do not fall for the free gift offer, unless you want to waste a half a day listening to their sales pitch.Remember, you get what you pay for. If you don't expect the best, you will enjoy your stay. If you expect the best, you will be very disappointed.

<Content>The fire did affect us... Trying to plan a wedding is stressful enough..........but the small things that didnt go right when we got here...just added to more stress!I will say Francelia did her best and did right many wrongs..It is just a difficult job to break the language barrier and the slow as mollasses pace to get to the problems.The resort was breathtaking...very well maintained and pretty.The beach ..the same.....but with problems of people taking chairs away fom you. I never had such problems. The food.....average. Some was very good...some...very bad. Did not like ANY beef they had.There numerous small issues.....key problems the day we arrived. The resort is not small...from where our rooms were..which were very roomy and turned out to be on the better side of nice...but the distance to the lobby.....far....needed to train it back several times. We were located in what would have been the perfect location if there werent so many issues that needed the front desk...and the fire. Im sorry this totally affected our stay. I had two teenagers that were constantly hungry. The fire had a beach snack bar that would have been opened from 12 am to 5am. Perfect for teenagers! That just brought the trip down for me!I remarried down there and while I will say the ceremony was beautiful...the time was perfect.....we just encountered so many issues before and after the ceremony. There are many boobies floating around the resort beach...which didnt really bother any of us. Just so you do know....It was a memorable trip.....and if I went back..I would probably go alone with my husband and no kids.......and try a different resort! If you have any questions ..feel free to email me:kd8257@hotmail.com

<Content>Good and Bad Experience A beautifull resort, but found that if you weren't platimum members, you didn't mean much to the resort. At no fault of the resort we experienced a few problems with sunquest., We travelled with 28 other people for my son's wedding, What we were told by sunquest and our tour operator was very different from what we received. A few of us were to have ocean front rooms, that didn't happen, Always problems with the water pressure and hot water, One of our party's room was located next to the sewer plant and the smell was so awful they had to leave their room early every morning and not return until sleep time the smell was making them sick, they couldn't even sit on their balcony. It rained on the wedding day and the wedding co-ordinator left the wedding party behind to fend for themselves and stand in the gazebo in the rain for over an hour before the tram came to pick them up, they were soaken wet in their wedding attire. This was unacceptable, She was to come to the reception to apologise bet never seen her again. You got okay service if you tipped well, an all inclusive is suppose to include gratities, but every time you turned around they were asking for tips. You should tip because you want to not because you feel you have too. Sunquest operator was a hit and miss all week, found that they didn't really care. Our bus was late by an hour to take up to the Airport and when it arrived it was very small, our luggage was put on the roof and it was raining, so everything got wet. The driver was very rectless and we almost got into a number of accidents along the way, didn't know if we would actually arrive at the airport or not. Definitely would not travel with sunquest again or go back to this resort. The unfortunate fire did take out a few restaurants and I think this resort made do very well with what they had, but it definetly impacted your choices for dining.

<Author>buckeyefan7099
<Content>Loved Punta Cana My husband and I made our first trip to the DR for our tenth wedding anniversary. We were concerned about the huge differences in the online reviews. We had a fantastic time. Reading the reviews helped make the expectations a bit more realistic and we were prepared for some of the common complaints - lack of hot water, mediocre food, rude tourists. That said, overall we had a great time.We went Platinum Club. I think that was worth it. We got premium liquor, free massages, dinner at a gourmet restaurant , a great location for our room, the ability to walk up and down the beach and get drinks at the other Princess resorts. Our room was clean and we always had plenty of towels for showers and the beach. We did tip our maid about three dollars per day. The water pressure was really low, but we did have hot water every day except the last day. We did not have any problems with bugs or mildew. The power would go off sometimes in the mornings, but not every day and never for very long.The Platinum lounge was really nice also. We could use the internet for free. I could usually get on a computer with no waiting. You could also mix your own drinks, get soft drinks or water or bottled beer here. My husband took a six pack back to our room. The staff in the Platinum lounge was very helpful with dinner reservations and replacing our lost coupon for the massages.The food is OK. Most of the food is very different from America - so, yes our systems had to adjust a time or two. But it was never bad enough to interfere with our activities. It was fun to try some different things. There were only one or two things I just flat our did not like. And yes, the restaurants are open air. We did not have trouble with flies. But we would see a bird fly through from time to time.Drinks all day long every day was fabulous. You have TO ASK for alcohol to be added to the mixed, slushy drinks - Pina colada, coco loco, etc. We always got good service and tipped a dollar almost every time we ordered a drink. Some people brought Bubba Kegs - good idea, this cuts down your trips to the bar for the 10 ounce plastic cup and helps keep your drink cold longer. The bartenders would fill them everytime.There were lots of nationalities represented at the resort. I barely speak Spanish, so I invested in a $2 phrase book that helped bridge any language gap. Most all of the staff knew enough English that we communicated without any problems.We did two excursions - Saona Island and horseback riding on Macao Beach. The Saona Island trip was AWESOME. The catamaran ride out was fabulous - great views and the water was amazing. The island itself was beautiful. The cookout was fine - just like what we would do in the states. There is plenty of rum flowing freely - be prepared for drinkers (I was one of those). You take speedboats to a Starfish Pool - we are pretty sure the starfish were dead. There was no snorkeling as advertised, but we did not miss it. The speedboats take you back to Bahibe. All in all, well worth the money and lots of fun. The horseback riding was fun also. The worst part was how filthy the beach was. The setting is beautiful, but the trash and debris on the beach was tragic. The horses were not as well kept as I would have liked, but this is the DR not Kentucky.Bottom line - you have to work really hard not to have fun here. We participated in some of the pool shows, ping pong tournament, salsa lessons. We watched at least some of all of the nightly shows. We walked around the grounds - saw the birds, iguanas, turtles and mangrove trees. It was very relaxing and we are looking forward to going back.

<Content>Absolutely Loved It......Again We have just returned from a 2 week vacation at this resort, and again I have been reading some reveiws and don't know where these other people must have stayed..............certainly not the same resort we did.Platinum Club:Upon arrival at the resort we were taken to the Platinum Lounge, and given our cool cloth and a drink and were treated in a very friendly manner. We were given a beautiful, private, secluded room but it was too far away from the Lounge and the action so we were given another one.........no problem. We travelled with our 2 girls ages 11  13. The Platinum Lounge is fantastic for the morning coffee, continental breakfast, fresh squeezed OJ, snacks throughout the day, specialty coffee's, teas premium brand drinks as well as a great place to sit around and chat or meet others. The staff in there were always friendly. The ACV rep Mylene is awesome. She is very informative and so friendly. A real bonus for all that book through ACV.Booking all your restraunts at once is so much better than having to stand in line every morning which is another service that is available, and if you have to change a reservation it is very easy to do with the friendly staff.Internet is offered free and is nice to be able to do your quick e-mail checks, however some guests abuse it and take forever. Or others think it is a great baby sitting aparatus, or go on the chat lines for long periods of time. The free massage and banana boat ride (or any other water sport activity, we just chose the banana boat) per person per week was great.Rooms:Again ours was great, always clean and plenty of towels they were changed twice a day, which was nice because we could shower in the morning and then again after being on the beach all day. The beach towels were also changed for us so there was no having to go to the towel hut and do it ourselves. Our beds were great and a full twin bed was brought in for one daughter while the other had the hide-a bed couch. We didn't spend a lot of time in the rooms, but they were very nice and kept very clean by the cleaning staff. We did run low on hot water when showering at the peak times a few times, but whatever!!! Think about it, 800+ rooms and the majority of guests showering at the same time.............after a couple showers at home do you run out of hot water? We certainly didn't let that ruin our vacation, and a cooler shower was sometimes nice after a long hot day on the beach :)Another reason we love this resort is because the rooms are all suites, so when travelling with 4 there is plenty of space and privacy. the bathroom is far away from the sleeping area so if you have to go in the night you don't wake everyone else up. Storage and closet/drawer space is plenty, as you can imagine we had a lot of stuff with 3 women and being there for 2 weeks. The big screen tv, and dvd player was nice for the girls a couple nights. As well as the selection of dvd's available to borrow from the lounge.Food:We hear so many complaints about the food.........again we have absolutely none. If you don't like what you got then you ordered or took the wrong thing. There are so many choices at so many restraunts. Now we were there when the terrible fire happened, and burnt down the breakfast and lunch buffet, as well as the Italian, Seafood, the Grill and the 24 hour restraunt and bar. It was horrific, however the resort compensted and made space in other locations for the restraunts. I believe the Italian is the only restraunt not operating temporarily. Had one not been there before and had these great reastraunts one would never know they were there. So for the time being it may be a little inconvienient as compared to the past, but there is still lot's of choices. You also can go to the other 2 properties and go to thier restraunts, which we did. One is adult only so we couldn't go with the girls. But the Italian, and Mexican restraunt at the one was great. We were picked up and taken there right from the lounge and it was about a 5 minute ride, again not a big deal, and it was a nice change. The French restraunt on property is fabulous. Again it's all about choices. The buffet was different all the time, so again great variety. The only downfall is ignorance of guests, which is definatly not the resorts fault. Using ones hands to grab food, or sticking fingers in sauces to taste is just absolutely rude, and I don't understand why people don't have common sense or manners. Or teach their children manners. Or the other thing is when at a buffet, you don't need to heap your plate so food is falling all over the place, and then waste half of it because it's cold, or you may not like it. Take all you want, but eat all you take. If you are unsure about something, just take a little, and go back for more. Don't be afraid to change something on the a'la cart menue, if you don't like pasta and that's what is says comes with your entre, ask for veggies or whatever. Pool: We didn't spend a lot of time at the pools. There is a quieter one by the main lobby, and one by the beach. They are cleaned every night, but again with that many people there it is hard. Maximo the pool bartender is great. There is a lot of stuff in the pool, again ignorance of guests not staff, and they try to clean up as best they can. There are showers provided to wash the sand off your body when coming from the beach to the pool, but most don't think that applies to them or their children. The entertainment staff tries to keep a lot of action and games going on. Again some people think they need to save (or hog) all the chairs.............groups are the worst. In reality are you going to sit on that chair at all times? There is a 30 minute rule, if you are not using one for 30 minutes you give up your right..............I only wish the resort was able to enforce that rule more. But they try to keep it friendly.Beach:Again, I think it is one of the nicest in the world. Beautiful white silky sand. No pebbles, no shells. We were there when the hotel was at 100% occupancy and there were plenty of chairs to go around. There are lot's of palapa's on the beach, but the ignorance of some non sharing guests takes over there too. One week was worse than the other. I think some just put their towels out before they go to bed, but then they don't show up until afternoon to use it. WHY????? Be courteous. Most times for the 4 of us we would use 1 or maybe 2 chairs. Just somewhere to put our stuff, we were in the water or playing volleyball most of the time anyways. Or we could share a chair for the short time we actually had our butts just sitting there. And then if we were going for a walk down the beach or going somewhere we would give up the chair for someone else who needed to USE it.There are 2 market type shopping areas either way about 20-30 minute walk. The one to the left of the resort when facing the ocean is bigger and there are more things. Mostly trinkets and lot's of local art work. The pictures are beautiful. But you must not be intimidated and be willing to barter and wheel and deal. It really is no different than any other island. You can get great deals. Please respect others, and don't take glass onto the beach, chances are it's going to break and someone is going to step on it and get hurt.In the Dominican it is okay to go topless, and lot's do. Some probably shouldn't but do anyways. After a couple days it's not a big deal, once you've seen one set.......................just beware as some find it offensive. Whatever, go to Disneyland then.Entertainment:There is lot's, you can be very involved or not involved at all. There are daily activities, such as yoga,stretching, volleyball and workouts on the beach. Dance lessons and fun games both by the pool and on the beach. The nightly entertainment is good, and they get some of the kids to participate in the Lion King production which is really cute. They are not top notch broadway shows, but I don't know why one would expect that. The staff put a lot of work and effort into them. The dancers are good. The only negative thing I could say is they could have something for kids/families to do from around 7pm on. They had little dancing on the stage for the very young children but that was it. Then evryone sat around until 9:45 for the show. It would be great to have some dancing or music. The shows start pretty late for most, especially if you do have children or have spent the day on the beach.....partaking in the activities. I think there was dancing some nights but not until after the shows. You can go to the disco off property, but not for the pre-teens, or older adults like my hubby and I. (back in our younger days maybe......)Weddings:There were several, there is a very nice wedding gazeebo overlooking the beach and up high enough so when photo's are taken you don't get all the guests in them who are on the beach. I heard the wedding co-ordinator is fabulous. Staff:This is a third world county, and a spanish speaking country. We need to respect that. Anyone involved with sales or direct contact with guests can speak english fairly well. The maids and gardeners, repair people not so well. But it is their first language. We expect tourists to speak english when they come to our country right? The main rule is to treat others with respect, and how you would like to be treated. The staff is trying to make a living. A tip here and there also goes a long way. We found the staff friendly and helpful, some may have had a bad day, or were probably just mistreated by a rude guest............just like anywhere. Remember life is all about choices!!!As for this resort, I sure hope they can rebuild the beautiful complex they lost, but even without it it is still a great place. We will definetly go back, and highly recommend this resort. Learn a little spanish, take some $1 bills, and look for the positive things. Don't let little peddy things ruin your vacation. Flights, bus rides, weather, rudeness of other guests, has nothing to do with this property. If you smoke, use an ashtray, if you have garbage, use a trash can, if you have taken plates full of food or glass glasses to the beach..........return them to the restraunt (again just common sense and courtesy so no one gets hurt). That goes for the trolly's that take you around the resort as well. They are good and safe, there are lot's of corners and unless you are not sitting down prperly there is no way you could fall off. The drivers are good. And again, there are plastic glasses provided by the lobby if you really MUST take your drink, no need to take glass on there, jsut in case. And as there are no ash trays on the trolly there is really no need to have to smoke on it either. So I hope this is helpful, and we can't wait to return.

<Content>Smelly Room/Horrible Food This was our first trip to the DR. When we got to there, the Paradisus which we booked through Amex was fully booked and had no rooms. They put us up at the Bavaro Princess, which we were very upset about. We stayed at this hotel for one night only. The first room they put us in smelled of mildew and the a/c was broke. The second room was better, but the mattress was rock hard the the bathroom had mildew and cracks on the ceiling. We ate at the buffet because we could not get into any of the nicer restaurants. The food was horrible. Well, we went home the next day. Our vacation was ruined. Between these 2 hotels, we will not be going back to Punta Cana.

<Content>No complaints here I must admit I had some apprehension before leaving for my vacation. The friend with whom I traveled told me to check out this site and I saw the typical responses--burned down restaurants, low water pressure, flies on the bread, and diarrhea!!! Needless to say, I was taken aback by the overwhelming amount of negative comments. The trip was already paid for, though, so I needed a break so I decided to just grin and bear it.I'm a very laid back person in general and can roll with the punches so I told myself that I would have a good time no matter what. I expect to still try to convince myself of that as I sat on the toilet losing a night's meal or as I shooed insects off my plate. I packed some Off and some Immodium AD and boarded my plane wide-eyed and ready to have some fun.Arriving in Punta Cana was great! My friend and I arrived late, but were greeted with cheerful natives who grabbed us and took our pictures. Their greeting was a bit impersonal, but it didn't matter because my friend and I both thought it was funny to be pushed, told to smile, and shoved towards customs all in a matter of seconds. Our tour guide for the half our bus ride to the resort was funny. His name was Sal, but he preferred to be called, Daddy. He'd say, Who's your daddy? And we'd all yell, Sal. During the commute, it was dark and hard to see most of the country, but my excitement did not wane.When we turned into the resort, I was amazed. I patted my friend's leg and told him, You made a good choice. Maybe you have some taste after all. The palm trees that lined the entrance, the well-manicured lawn, and even the angry parrot that kept his back turned to tourists the whole time were a great welcome. Checking in was easy and I was surprised to see the layout of the resort was more of a villa than a typical hotel. One could either walk to their room or take the tram. We chose the latter and ended up with an impromptu tour guide whose hands were full of El Presidente and whose last day it was to enjoy the resort.Our room was great. The size was perfect for the two of us and I'm still trying to decide if my favorite part was the columns on the bed that made me feel like a princess or the bidet that helped me clean the sand out of my unmentionable parts. Our room was in the middle of the resort so we were at a convenient walking distance to the beach, the pool, and Chopin (where you have to eat breakfast and watch the little black fish devour the bagels). Since I mentioned food, yes it is true that some of the restaurants burned down. The compensation for that is that you get to eat at the other resorts. That gave us a chance to see how the others lived...err...vacationed. Much of the food was great (I especially enjoyed the fresh omelets for breakfast and I definitely can't complain about the round-the-clock drinks).Each day, my companion and I ventured to the beach where we'd pretty much stand neck-deep in the water, lay in the sun, grab something to eat, and then lay in the sun again. Were there flies on the bread? Yes. Was the buffet food always steaming hot? No. It's vacation, though. And there are certain expectations you should have when dining on the beach--the wind will blow your napkins away, sand will land in your mustard, and there's absolutely no place to put your cup. But, hey, it's a vaction. You can have sandless drinks and napkins that stay when you get back to reality.When you want to get around the resort, walking has its advantages as well as taking the tram. Walking is serene and tranquil and kinda romantic at night (although I didn't admit that to my friend). Taking the tram showed us parts of the resort we wouldn't have walked on because it was kinda out of the way. One day, we took the tram and learned there was a hidden path that lead across a bridge. There were turtles, ducks, and fish in the water. There were vultures in a cage and geese walking the path. At the end, a peacock stood with his feathers beautifully displayed and three swans were taking a stroll in front of us. I tried to feed them and one of them starting pecking at my shoe. It was hilarious (the hilarity kicked in AFTER I ran for my life...Hey, I saw that episode of when animals attack)!As far as excursions go, we only did the shopping one. We're not big shoppers so we just used the time to see more of the city. We also racked up on loads of native Lays Brand chips that included flavors like shrimp and butter, bacon and plaintain, and something that looked like pork rinds. The food was great (try the muscles, the shrimp, the coffee, and the Tuesday night beach party if you can). Speaking of the Tuesday night party, it was great. There was lobster, steak, soft music, and a huge pale moon hanging overhead. It was like the ones you'd see on a movie. I was so tempted to ask my friend to steal George Bailey's line from It's a Wonderful Life, where he'd promised to lasso the moon. The night was gorgeous and the food was great...even when the power went out. Many people complained about that part, but I saw it as an opportunity to have a mystery dinner. I could barely see what I was eating so I could play guess what this is? Kidding. The black-out wasn't nearly that dramatic and there were candles on the table that helped us see.Overall, I really enjoyed my vacation. It was short enough for me to want more, but long enough for me to be satisfied. I know I've already said a lot, but you can contact me at benyka@hotmail.com if you'd like to know more or if you have specific questions.

<Content>Highly recommended Stayed here April 6-13th to attend a wedding. 21 of us went, ranging in age from infant to retired.We stayed in Platinum Club through Air Canada Vacations. We were very pleased with everything about the Platinum Club- worth the extra cost.The rooms,resort, beach, pools, staff and grounds were excellent.No issues with the burned down facilities- did not affect our trip.Weather was fantastic, no rain.Food was good. We did not get sick.If you are planning to get married, we suggest a late afternoon wedding- any other time is simply too warm- avoid a midday beach wedding. The wedding gazebo is fine and very close to the beach for photos.Overall an awesome vacation- no complaints whatsoever.

<Content>Have to see it to believe it!!!??! We are a fun 35 year old european couple, seasoned travellers, no kids, and chose a cruise in the Caribbean and a week at Bavaro Princess for our honeymoom. The cruise was lovely and we shall do another one soon, but the hotel was not up to standard. This hotel is NOT adequate for a honeymoon. Please beware.We have visited Punta Cana 4 times, and this was by far the worst travel experience ever. Although lovely, the gardens (and nature all around) do not make up for the bad service. When on holiday, I never complain and we take things easy - but for the first time in my life I had to make TWO formal complaints in just 5 days!! And we weren't the only ones complaining- imagine that they actually ran out of complaint sheets!!Major Problem 1: we booked a honeymoon suite by the beach and they gave us a terrible run-down room next to the building site next door. After a big struggle, we were moved 2 days later to a more decent environment, yet the new room had a 20cm lizard that someone had squashed on the wall, next to the bed! Room maintenance was very poor - the ceiling needed painting, the bathroom was very rundown, furniture was very scuffed,I had to bribe the maid with 10 dollars in order to get her to wash the floors properly. Our toilet broke down twice and the mini kitchen sink was blocked. It was simply not 5 star quality. Problem 2: On my husband's birthday, we dinned at Restaurante Chopin and halfway through the meal, the wine still hadn麓t been served, so my husband asked again. The waiter didn麓t like to be reminded, so he whispered something in another waiter's ear. This second guy winked and smiled at our waiter, and instantly I felt that he was up to mischief, so I watched him carefully. He fetched our wine bottle and I saw him remove 2 dirty glasses from the table where there was a pile of dirty plates and glasses. He then proceeded to wipe them clean with a napkin that he removed from the basket that is used to place the dirty linen from the restaurants. We were shocked and demanded the presence of the Director. At first they tried to intimidate us, then to tell us there was no-one available. In the end, after a 40 min waite, the Director miraculously was available. It was amazing how the matre'D changed his attitude once the Director arrived!! The Director was very gracious and even offered us treats, which we obviously refused because all we wanted was a verbal apology as well as to prevent this sort of behavior towards other clients.Problem 3: I went for a facial at the spa. I have one twice a month back home (generaly lasts for one and half hours and costs 45 鈧? so I knew what to expect. Instead, I was amazed at the poor quality that the hotel spa had to offer. I paid 90 dollars for a 30 min facial (that was supposed to last 45 min), that did not include exfoliation because they had run out of it and did not include high frequency treatment because the machine was broken. Yet I had paid and for it. The beautician did not wear gloves or face mask, and had a terrible cold and coughed alot. So I guess that now I know why payment for these services is made upfront! I was simply too tired and dissapointed with the hotel to even bother to complain about this poor ripoff service. I paid, left and swore never to go back. The same day, my husband had a massage and he too complained about the lack of technique and the high price.Problem 4: Every time we ate at the buffet, we felt sick by what we saw: some guests have no manners and instead of using the buffet utensils, they simply grab hand-fulls of food such as bacon, olives, lettuce, cakes, carrots, bread, etc. Worst of all, was a man who grabbed the last 4 pastries on a plate, squeezed them all, opened his hand and then left them on the plate... luckily a waiter saw this and removed the diry pastries. In all my life, I have never been in a hotel with such ill-mannered english speaking people around me. It was alien! Weird! Look, the beach is lovely, the gardens are great, and the surroundings are nice and clean, and if you like:* a lot of noise;* loads of people around you;* americans swearing loudly from time to time;and if you don't mind doing alot of walking, this place is great. But if, like us, you like good service with a personalized touch, AVOID this place. It has too many noisy guests, too much confusion and you spend hours in cues - cues for the transport, cues for breakfast, cues at the bar, etc. For the first time ever, we came back home more tired and stressed than when we left for our honeymoon. Who knows, maby it's nice if you go during a low season... We shall definitely never go back!

<Content>THE BEST!! This hotel was my favorite hotel i ever stayed at it was my second time in this hotel i just came the back from this hotel today. i was there from the 4-16 of April the restaurants that were burned down was not a problem at all!! we could even go too different princess hotels too eat so that made 12 restaurants!! The food was soo good but the service can be better at the restaurants. the rooms were huge. this was my 18th time in Dominican Republic and this is the best one. The entertainers were amazing from the pool to the beach to the show and the after show there always a pleasure to dance with and too talk to. The landscape is incredible and the views were breathtaking we had a ocean view from our balcony. i ashore you will be satisfied with your stay and the beaches were very clean. I will also be there very soon at that same hotel.

<Content>How beautiful What a beautiful place to go to. The beach was spectacular, the best I have ever seen. I wasn't aware that there would be topless ladies and was a little surprised. The grounds were beautiful and miticliously manicured;. The fire didn't allow us to enjoy the beach front resturants but they did try to accomidate us by setting up a beach side outdoor cafe and sharing a spot in the other resturants for the other ones that were burnt down. This is the largest resort we have been on and missed be able to just walk were we wanted. I didn't mind it as much as my husband did. The buffet was nice and could always find something that I would like to eat. The steak house we enjoyed but the seafood resturant we were disappointed in. Our room was very nice and very clean., Our maid service was really good. We had trouble with our TV when we got there and they came right away and fixed it. Another thing we didn't know is that travelers checks are hard to cash there. You would be better to bring a wodd of dollar bills and you will be fine. Apple Vacations did take travelers checks for the excurisions that we booked. We have snorkled every where we've been and the best was on the 2 person speed boats that take you out to snorkel. They gave us a ball of oatmeal that held together in the water and you could pick off pieces and the fish would come and eat out of our hands, it was awesome. I would go back again but I would bring snack foods with me.

<Content>A week in Paradise! Traveled with a group of 28, 10 high school seniors and parents April 6 - 13, through Apple/Cleveland. The only complaint would be cooler water and little water pressure at prime shower times, but the cool water felt good on sunburned skin. We heard of the fire before arriving and the staff did a wonderful job of compensating. Beach buffets on both sides of the beach with grilled hot dogs, burgers, steaks, chicken, pork chops, peppers, tomatoes, daily. We could also hop on the shuttle to Chopin or main buffet for wonderful lunches wtih all the fixings. Chopin was opened daily for breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as main buffet. The fire scene was boarded up, restrooms were still available on both sides of the beach as was a beach bar. Most people had to ask where was the fire? There was no ash, no smell, and little hammering, from where we found to sit near the beach or pool.  We tipped for our first drink each day and received wonderful, and quick service always. No one out of 28, got sick. We ate fruits, veggies, cheeses, etc. Our seniors wanted to disco so we went to Areito, beside the other Princess hotels, and had a good, safe time. Some enjoyed the Casino. Dinner privileges at the other hotel - Le Petite Fondue, was enjoyed by all. We also enjoyed walking to the other Princess Hotels for lunch at the Crepery and drinks and dips in their pools. We were welcomed by their staff. We also took a snorkeling tour and the Safari Jeep tour, both were amazing! Food and drinks were plentiful and great selection even for the picky eaters in the group. We enjoyed the night time entertainment and dancing with the entertainment staff each evening after the show.The Bavarro Princess staff goes out of their way to make sure that your vacation is a week in paradise!

<Content>8 out of 10 Rooms:The rooms were beautiful. They had tons of room and were cleaned daily. This place was unique because the resort was not set up like a hotel... you felt as if you were in your own condo. It was also great that your fridge was stocked daily!Staff:The staff was great. They were all VERY friendly, from the grounds keepers to the managment. My wife and I decided to tip as much as possible, even though it is all-inclusive. These people work for very little money and a buck brings a huge smile to their face. We even tiped the grounds people. Food:When people say the food is different... they are right! The morning buffet never changes, which sucks. I pretty much ate pancakes and bacon every day... but I worked with it. I recommend taking a trip outside of the resort to the other Princess hotels to eat there. It's different and much better. It does take time to get your food, but this is because they are short staffed. Just be patient... you're on vacation. Also, be sure to make reservations for dinner two nights before you want to do. If you don't foget it... you'll once again be eating at the buffet.Beach:BEAUTIFUL! They sweep it daily. Be sure to get up early to reserve your beach hut because they go fast. If you do reserve it, please stay with your beach hut. I found it very rude how people would reserve the hut, leave, and not come back for several hours. It clearly states if it is not in use for over 30 min. it is up for grabs. Remember... be respectful! Oh... bring plenty of sun tan lotion. I recommend to start with 50 spf for the first couple days. Relax, be patient, have fun, be merry, and enjoy yourself. Remember... you are on vacation.

<Content>Loved it - we'll be back! just returned on 04/13/07...loved the resort and we would definately go back. we were upset about the fire and the loss of the restaurants/bars but once we got there you would have never known. we split each day between the beach and the pool and we were never bothered by ash or noise from the re-construction as others mentioned. the staff was extremely friendly. for those that experienced bad service, try rewarding good service with a few dollar bills - it goes a long way. by mid-week we had made friends with a great waitress Jenny at the buffet that welcomed us and had a table ready as soon as we walked in. we stopped checking in with the hostess and just went directly to her section. within minutes of sitting down we had a chilled bottle of champagne on our table and another one ready and waiting for when the first one was empty. she even brought out a birthday cake and had her fellow co-workers sing Happy Birthday to my father! All this because we were respectful to her and tipped her for her excellent service. the food was better than most other resorts, this was our 5th trip back to Punta Cana. the drinks were good and again if you take care of your bartenders, they take care of you. we had top shelf alcohol and we were not on the platinum club package. the beach is the best around by far. the rooms were spacious and clean. the a/c could have been colder but it wasn't unbearable. the hot water was sometimes non-exsistant during peak showering times but the cool water feels good after spending the day in the sun. for those that were not happy about the lack of english speaking staff members - you are not in America anymore - you are in their country and should speak their language - just like when people come here to America we/you expect them to speak english :) we were a group of 4 adults and 1 toddler and we had a great time and would definately go back! go open minded and you'll have a blast.

<Content>Beautiful, BUT..... We traveled to Punta Cana for our 20th wedding anniversary. This resort was very beautiful and clean. The grounds were breathtaking, the beach was amazing, we walked it everyday. A few days before arriving there was a major that took all the restaurants by the pool area. This was not such a big deal for us, we were able to dine at the other Princess resorts, however, the jackhammering at the pool was very annoying. It rained 5 out of the 7 days that we were there.We had a problem getting there with USA 3000 our flight was delayed 4 times, which caused us to loose 2 days of our vacation, we were able to extend the two days, but with additional costs to us, which we thought was very unfair. Our room was clean and spacious and did not smell. There is not much nightlife here, the resort shows were very cheesy and the disco did not open till very late at night. Our bus broke down on the commute to the resort. The food was not very good at all, we had to wrestle our steaks. Everything was presented beautifully, but tasted horrible. The resort has a real problem with washcloth shortages, we had to call everyday to get washclothes, theydid send us 2 fruit baskets for our aggrevation. Overall, the resort is beautiful, food horrible, not much nightlife. We did do the Outback Safari, which we loved, I highly recommend it, best part of our trip. Language barrier was a problem. Very beautiful place.

<Content>The good ...the bad Just got back from a week at the Princess Mar 30 -Apr 6. Thanks to all those who wrote reviews before. They were all helpful in setting my expectations.I'll keep it simple. The good....-The most beautiful beach I have ever seen. My girlfriend and I walked for hours everyday in each direction on unending powdery palm tree line beaches with the warmest water spashing on our feet...perfect.- The grounds were lush and immaculately kept. Such a beautiful variiety of foliage and lots of free ranging birds lik peacocks. While grounds are a little spread out, it never took more than 10 minutes to walk from one end to the other again in a beautiful setting. Shuttles always available if we wanted.-The weather was 10/10...80 degrees sunny light to moderate winds. Couldn't have dialed it up any better- The rooms were open, spacious well air conditioned aqnd not musty or buggy. Individual verandas awesome in AM and evening-Platinum club was great. Helpful staff nice clubhouse. worth a few extra $- Went with Air Canada Vacations...no problems...smooth operation. On time, good flights, quick transfers with everything well organized. The bad...- The food could have been better. Like any all-inclusive it gets to be all the same by weeks end. Lots of variety though so you should be able to find something to your liking.- Staff was not always the happiest crowd. And language was a bit of a problem.- Hot water was not available at peaktimes (4-6pm) but cold felt good after hot day in sun.Hope this helps...we'll go back...

<Content>bavaro we went through apple vacations and thats always a friendly flight. resort in general was absolutely beautiful and everything was always clean and ready to go. the food was alright, nothing fancy and the restaurants were okay as well. the pool was clean and very big. there was a bar in the pool and the drinks were great. the beach was amazing, the sand clean without any rocks and the water very seethrough. the people there all spoke english and were a big help. id definetly encourage people to go there. no one will regret a trip like this. however, it's a trip for people over 18, theres just more to do that way.

<Content>Terrible Overall We read the reviews but did not believe. This hotel is aweful. We are not picky, but this resort is horrible.Our rooms smelled of mildew. We asked around and most people agreed that the rooms were smelly. The room also had little bugs and the matress smelled also. We have traveled all over and this was the worst hotel we have ever stayed at. The food was okay, but the service was terrible. The wait staff was miserable and rude. It took forever to get a cup of coffee. We requested a new matress due to a back problem, at first they told us no problem but they never gave us a new one and told us to sleep on the floor. The pool had 2 restaurants that burnt down a few weeks back and debris is all over the pool area. They were also jackhammering the entire time we were at the pool. The pools are also dirty and slippery around the edges because of the debris. The food on the beach is horrible with flies constantly swarmimg around. There was no nightlife, the shows were absolutley terrible, I could have put on a better show. This hotel is definitley not worth going to, it's worth spending the extra money on a better resort.

<Content>Re-book Now Four restaurants burned down the week of 3/19 - and we were not informed until we got there. As a result, we were given the option to eat at two other facilities (Punta Cana Princess and Caribe Club Princess) via a golf cart shuttle. It was inconvenient, to say the least. However, you did have extra options of restaurants that otherwise would not have been available.The building that housed the four restaurants that burned down is between the pool and the beach. As a result, pool-goers suffered from incessant hammer-banging all day long, as well as flying bits of ash to mix in with suntan lotion. Beach-goers were only burdened by the hammering. Also, the number of restrooms located at the building were reduced by half.The food was mediocre. Side dishes at restaurants were routinely cold (vegetables, potatoes). Buffet food was generally the wrong temperature: eggs, pancakes, and potatoes were cold, while cheeses and sauces were hot and melted. Stick with salads, fruits and meats, as well as freshly made-to-order options like omelets and pasta.Service was better. Wait staff and bartenders were friendly. Good luck getting a cocktail -- you go to them, they don't go to you, unfortunately. Oh, speaking of cocktails, don't go here expecting top shelf. The premium drinks that cost extra were Absolut, Smirnoff and Budweiser. The included drinks were all D.R. national brands. Stick with fruity, frozen drinks or the one draft beer offered. And don't order a mojito -- it has no mint leaves; just mint liquor. Caipirina was a nice option (white rum, lime juice and sugar).Hotel was clean, trains run regularly throughout, gardens were gorgeous. Overall, a nice setting and beautiful beach.

<Content>Fantastic This was our first time in the Dominican Republic. After searching for affordable hotels, we chose the Bavaro Princess.What an excellent choice.Even with the fire of the 3 restaurants, they accomodated everyone and even relocated the restaurants in other locations. One in the main buffet restaurant and another in the Chopin restaurant. never had a problem making reservatins for 7 people.Hats off to these people.The food was excellent, the room very clean, the people very friendly.The beach was spectacular.We even plan to go back there in the same period for 2 weeks.

<Content>Love this resort My boyfriend and I stayed at the Bavaro princess for 5 nights in March for our Spring Break. This was our second stay at this resort. We were in building 45, which was a nice middle location, right near the restaurants Chopin and Sakura, and right near a tram stop. We were sad to hear about the fire at the beach bar/buffet. We spent every day at the beach buffet, overlooking the beautiful water. We really do not have anything bad to say about the resort. I am a picky eater, and I always found something to enjoy. I especially love the fresh fruit smoothies at the breakfast buffet. We did not get sick (last visit or this one). The reason most people get sick/diarrhea is because the overdo it on Coco Locos and Banana Mamas. The grounds are immaculate, the rooms spacious, and the people friendly. The only critique is that there is not a lot of nightlife there, but the staff works hard. The best is when they have audience participation shows, those are the funniest, and the Lion King show wasn't bad. Plus, after a few drinks, not much can be very entertaining! We booked through Apple Vacations, and they were a very good tour company. I would definetly recommend this resort! The biggest piece of advice: Be open minded! This is a different country!!! Respect them and they respect you! The thing I hated most about this vacation is the complainers!!! Enjoy your visit!!!

<Content>March 23-30 great vacation We had a great time despite all the worries I had about the resort. We went with the idea of just relazing and not worrying about the minor things. We found out a few days before we left that the resort had a major fire. This did change things, but still we made it work. We got a little tired of the temp. buffet set up on the beach, but we end up walking down to the Punta Cana Princess and had some lunch down there. I would highly recommend it if you want a change in your lunch menu.Go platinum!!!! First of all I have to say if you go platinum you will see Juan V. and get to know him. He's a great guy! I'm saying this because I told him about this website and I know he's reading it! Hey Juan...thanks for all the Presidente's!!!We took full advantage of the platinum and ordered room service several times. Especially for breakfast, when you don't feel like getting up and going down for breakfast. Breakfast on your patio was awesome.There is a huge langauge barrier, but you are in their country. We did notice that the staff who were especially friendly, were the one's that spoke good English. One of the gals that went with us did speak some Spanish and that was extremely helpful. I highly suggest you pick up the basics in Spanish.Food was good, our only complaint was that it could have been warmer. But I didn't go for just the food.Beach..one word...AWESOME. We've been to Jamaica twice and it just does not compare. You really feel like you are walking on powder. And it was so nice to walk out into the ocean and not step on anything but soft sand. The ocean was quite a bit rougher than what we were used to, but it made if a riot to play in. Would I go back? Definately. Having some restaurants and bars on the beach would have made a big difference, so I would go back just to see that. I do have to say that I probably would not bring my young children to that resort. Other resorts in the area cater alot more to the younger kids. Good for the teenage age, but not so good for littler one's.If you have any questions, please feel free to email me.

<Content>Just got back Water was warm  the beach was great!! The staff really bent over backwards to please us. The restaurant burning was a non issue with us. We still ate at the hotel and they made reservations for us at the hotel next door. We don't goto Punta Cana for the food anyway, we go there for the beach.

<Content>Wasn't what I had expected I just returned from a one week stay at the Bavaro Princess (booked through Apple Vacations). Our party included 8 adults and my 10 month old son. When we arrived we had asked to be put into rooms that were close to eachother, which they did but we were all the way down past the beach. The grounds were beautiful but the rooms did smell a little musty. The crib that was provided for my son had screws hanging out of it and was very unsafe, our hot water did not work for DAYS (even though we asked that it be fixed quite a few times), one of our refrigerators were broken (which again took a few days to be fixed), our air conditioning did not work and the lights in one of our rooms kept going on and off. The maid service was horrible. The only thing that they did was give us new towels and make our bed. Our floors were extremely dusty and our sheets were never washed or changed our entire stay. Many of the staff members were very polite and pleasant except for when we were in the main buffet located in the lobby. They took forever to get us drinks and did not look happy to be there at all. Also, there was a fire that took place 2 days after we arrived. As unfortunate as it was (glad no one was hurt) I feel we were robbed of part of our vacation. Our all inclusive package was supposed to include 6 restuarants and we ended up only having a choice of 3. One being the buffet that had very poor service. The last night of our vacation I had to rush my son to the local hospital because he had a fever of 104. We received very prompt and friendly service when this need arose. However, when we got to the hospital they had told me my son had a bacterial infection in his tonsils. Upon our arrival home I took my son to our local ER and they ran some tests. We found out that he had salmonella from the food there. A few of our other group members are also in the process of being tested as they have been violently ill since we have returned home. Overall the resort had beautiful grounds, the beach was gorgeous, and somehow with all the problems we still managed to have a good time. The staff did try really hard to compensate for the losses from the fire, but It would have been so much better if there wasn't as much chaos.

<Content>PEOPLE NEED TO RELAX - GREAT RESORT Ok Where to Start. The pool / beach bar did burn down. Staff went above and beyond to accommodate everyone and did a good job. Food. Well, overall is fine. By the end of the week my wife and I grew tired of all the food. BUT...remember...that will be the same anywhere you go. PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBER THIS IS A FORIEGN COUNTRY. The food is going to be different from your fried chicken...meatloaf...McDonalds or whatever. Regarding the shows. We met up with people from all over the country and I think that we all agreed the shows were entertaining. However, don't expect to see Broadway. People are just too picky. The Platinum club was worth it. We got preferential treatment everywhere we went. It was easier to make reservations for dinner and etc. The Platinum Club Lounge was nice because you could water, soda, beer, mixed drinks and etc. The rooms were pretty nice, raised bedroom with nicely spaced bathroom. With Platinum suites, we got a room right up by the beach rather than back by the front of the resort. I can honestly say that I really had to reach to find something wrong. I guess the air conditioning in the room could have been better. Also, water pressure is a problem during peak hours. Again, we were on vacation so we didn't worry about it. Over all it was very nice. The people work very hard to make you happy. If you are going to travel there, at any resort, take 100 or more ones and if you plan on taking the jungle tour, bring some crayons, pencils, coloring books for the kids when you tour the school. To be honest, the only thing my wife and I were sick of by the end of the week were the rude tourists. I wouldn't consider this resort the very best but it definately gets the job done. Honestly, the staff was very polite and helpful but we were really embarrassed by the tourists. Also, people need to get over the topless issue. Its amazing how many people say we were shocked by the nudity.... Do some research on the places you're going. I read plenty of these reviews and got exactly what I expected. Have fun, tell Ruben at the pool bar No Pee Pee in the Pool Senior. For those out there that are going to be made during their vacation, don't ruin other people's becuase you have to nit-pick everything.

<Content>Nice Resort! We traveled to this resort from 03/17-03/24 and the first night we got there the resort had a fire that took down 4 restaurants and a bar.Needless to say this had a dramatic affect on our stay. Their solution was to cut the 3 remaining restuarants in half as a replacement for the ones that burned down. This worked out horribly...Never enough room for reservations due to over crowding. The times were all screwed up. It was awful so I mainly stuck with the buffet which did have some good stuff. The rice was always good and the beef stew. Had lots of pasta. the grounds are beautiful and well kept. The rooms were very nice and above average and always clean. The beach was stunning. BEWARE if you have children because this is a topless resort. I did not know that until I got there and I traveled with my 4 yr old. Made it rather uncomfortable for me to explain. Entertainment was ok at best. Be sure to tip Edwin. Very good with children. Not much night life but about 5 mins away there is a good club called Mongu. It is wild. The resort is so big that walking is not an option. You must use the tram but for the most part were pretty frequent but hold on or you might be thrown off because they drive crazy. Overall, this was a nice resort but will try something else next time because I like trying new resorts every time I visit the islands.

<Content>Loved this resort! Have just returned from a week at the Bavaro Princess. Was nervous having read some of the reviews on here but shouldnt have been!The grounds of this hotel are fabulous and the individual suites are quiet and secluded. The resort is extensive and some rooms are a way from the beach and the main lobby area but the transportation is frequent and the grounds are well worth walking around. The food was not the greatest at the buffet (not really good at all!) but there was always hamburgers, pizza  hot dogs! There are several other restaurants available although some at an additional cost. Did not suffer any ill effects from the food and believe me if anyone would it was going to be me!Beach is superb, miles of white sand and we walked the entire length of the beach! No problems with any hawkers, they were there but not intrusive. If you want to reserve a palm umbrella on the beach you need to be up early and leave your towels on the desired spot! By 9am there are none left although plenty of lounge chairs without any shade. Forget the 30 minute rule that appears in the hotel brochure!Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel!

<Content>Not all that great---READ IF GOING HERE SOON!!!! Okay, where to start......My boyfriend and I stayed here from March 15th-19th.....The resort itself and the beach here is absolutely beautiful....If you are looking into getting the platinum package, I will warn you, its not all that great....they say that you get the premium drinks....but, it don't matter if you have the platinum bracelet or not, you do not get them unless YOU ASK for them. The only thing that we thought was good about the platinum package was the fact that you get a private check-in/check-out and you didn't have to pay for the room service. Other than those 2 reasons, we didn't think the platinum was all that great or different from the regular packages. There was a fire at the resort on Saturday night, the bar on the beach burnt down along with 4 of the restaurants. They did try to accomodate everyone, but they were trying to squeeze 2 restaurants into 1, so it wasn't all that great cause they were squeezing all those people into one restaurant. They did set up a little canopy on the beach as a bar but then you couldn't get a frozen drink and you weren't able to get alot of the drinks that people would normally have, they only had a select few since the fire. Service was not all that great, once in the restaurant a server would come around asking what kind of drink you would like, but by the time they got there with your drink, you were already finished eating and ready to go. Our second day there, we had no hot water whatsoever, we did call the front desk to tell them and we were told that the whole resort was having a problem and they were working on it, well it was about 5 hours later that I was finally able to shower. If you are looking for a party time, this is not the place for you. There is NO nitelife here. Come 11:30-12:00, thats it, everything is done and it seemed that everyone was then on their way back to their rooms, everyone just dissappeared. They do have a disco up in the casino, we did try it out 3 out of our 4 nights there and all 3 nights there were maybe 5-10 people in there, so it really isn't even worth wasting your time to go up there. The shows were absolutely horrible, not good at all. Some of the staff are a little funny but others just try too hard and their not funny at all...haha. Just incase your agent has not told you, be prepared to see a few topless women on the beach, not too many but some do go topless. We didn't know about that so were kind of shocked once we saw it. In all, we did try to make the best of it but was not at all what we expected. We would return to Punta Cana but don't think we would return to the BP.

<Content>Fire at Bavaro Princess Just got back from Bavaro Princess on Monday, 3/19/07.Don't let any one kid you. It was a major fire that burnt down all the restaurants and bars along the beach with the exception of one bar on the beach and the pool bar.They have done a great job of relocating restauants and bars to other parts of the facilty.The restauarants and bars that aren't located on the beach were totally unaffected such as Sukura, Chopin, Hispaniola, Piano Bar, Premium Lounge, etc.The fire was on Sunday morning around 2AM to 5AM and was unfortunately quite spectactular as it was the buildings with the thatched roofs that caught on fire. Once it caught there was no stopping it.I thought that waking up later Sunday morning that the place was going to be chaos but was amazed how well they handled the situation.By 10 AM they had the place all roped off and there were workers everywhere cleaning up.People were using the pool and beach as if nothing happened.We went to breakfast which was moved to Chopin Restauarant and there was hardly a line at all.I don't know how crowded lunches and dinners got as we left for our return flight home that got cancelled around 11:30 PM from a 3:20 PM take-off and got shipped off to another hotel for an attempt at a return flight home on Monday supposedly due to weather delays and equipment problems back in Boston. (No fault of Bavaro Princess).Overall I thought the place was pretty nice and didn't find a lot of the negative things that other reviews have stated.Food was ok at best...certainly nothing great.Went with a group of 10 of us for a week and none of us got sick.

<Content>Loved it! Great value!! We had a great time; a wonderful relaxing vacation. Bavaro beach is spectacular. We've been to many beaches in Hawaii, and Bavaro beach is the best yet!Our bungalo room was roomy, clean, frig was stocked with bottled Coke, water, beer.The lobby shows (pre-show at 9:30) were beautiful; live music, great singing, lovely costumes.Restaurants are nice, we felt the selections were great, food was served promptly, fresh and hot. The buffets were clean, had lovely presentation, friendly staff.For the money this resort exceded our expectations.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation A friend and I spend a wonderful week in at the Punta Cana - Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort March 1st - March 8th.After reading some of the reviews I was hesitant that we had not picked the best location for our winter vacation, however, we were very pleased with this complex. I believe some of the reviews that I read were mislabeled and as they did not describe Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort where we stayed.Beach: The beach was great and there was plenty of shade when you needed it, however, most guest go down early and throw a towel or personal item on chairs and don鈥檛 return until hours later. We found that afternoon it was easy to find a shaded chair.Rooms: the rooms were very large, this was our 5th all-inclusive trip with Apple and by far this was the largest room that we ever had. My only note is there are two sets of steps, so it you have trouble with steps this could be a problem. Yes, the rooms are old but the management does try to keep things in working condition. We had a few problems that were fixed with 2 hours of our arrival.Food: Please remember that when in another country most food with the exception of breakfast will not taste like our American food. This is the first place that I have had lobster so many times. The hotel had a party on the beach one night for all Apple Vacation guests that was great. We had linen tablecloths, linen napkins, waiters for drinks and a keyboard player and singer. Dance floor too, dancing within several feet of the waves, what more could you ask. The food was ok but the atmosphere was wonderful, full moon and all. You can go to ale cart restaurants every night if you wanted. The only restaurant I didn鈥檛 really like was Chopin. Sea Food Restaurant - the service was slow, they didn鈥檛 seem to understand was we were requesting, however food was very good. Sakura 鈥?great food, great service, my favorite. Buffet was a buffet, what can I say. Steak place 鈥?service  food good, don鈥檛 expect American beef.Pool: If I change something, it would be the pools. There was one very large pool with one swim up bar and it got very crowed, especially with kids. I would have enjoyed this complex more if they a couple more pools scattered throughout the complex such as the Bahia Principe Punta Cana where we stayed 2 years ago, they had 4, 3 with swim-up bars. There was a small pool near the lobby but you had to take the tram to get there too inconvenient. We went there the first afternoon and it was very quiet.Grounds: The grounds were so beautiful, mature vegetation, manicured and very clean.Staff: Most were friendly, however the registration personnel with the exception of a new young lady, who鈥檚 name slips my mind, were rather rude. There was a young lady I believe her name was Marilyn at Chopin who was the best of all.I would probably not stay at this hotel again for several reasons, to big and too many children. It鈥檚 not the children fault, it鈥檚 the parents who don鈥檛 watch them. I would choose a hotel next time that is all adults.

<Content>disappointed.... Punta Cana was beautiful... The Bavaro Princess, on the other hand was more like a 3 star hotel, and not a 5 like i was promised from my travel agent. This is a HUGE property,like 96 acres, my villa was close to the beach, so to get to the main lobby i had to wait for a tram... i was going to the main lobby like everyday because i was having issues with my room, or this or that.. So many problems arised on my vacation..equaled alot of WASTED TIME!!!! the gorunds were beautiful, and the beach was beautiful.. the hotel itself,not a 5 star..mold in the rooms, bug problems,worm problems, i had to be moved out of my room,when i finally got it because it wasnt ready til 3pm,to another room,that still wasnt so nice! slow service,(we waited almost 3 hours in the sakura restaurant, and still had to go to the buffet after to get something filling!)  the food was HORRIBLE... i stuck with rice and chicken, and pizza...the drinks were so watered down... the staff was very friendly, but most didnt speak english.. alot of europeans at this hotel, most were very friendly, i found the french canadians to be very ignorant and rude..they need a lesson in etiquette!This was an all inclusive.. but when u get there they ask u to upgrade to a platnum club.. which includes free room service, access to 2 upscale restaurants,and a bar.. didnt have this sort of thing on other all inclusives.. so i was kinda pissed about this... I didnt do this upgrade...you do have to make reservations to eat,except for at the main buffet.also mad about this! i'm on vacation ..i dont want to be timed! i stay on the beach til 5 or 6..dont want to rush around.. needless to say the day i got there they had like 10:30pm..haha!!! i laughed ur kidding rite! who eats that late??? so dinner reservations were booked until like my 3 rd day there! anyway,i'm really not a complainer,but these were little things that so could be improved! maybe i am just spoiled!I booked through apple vacations, so needless to say , if i had a problem the only people that helped me were the apple reps.. I would not recommend this hotel to other people, and i am writing a LONG letter to apple vacations!!!

<Author>I-Dawg
<Content>Confused by mixed reviews? Here's the real deal! Before we left, we were very worried (and very confused) by the wild discrepancies in reviews of the Bavaro Princess. Having just returned, I think I can clear it up. Like most things in life, whether YOU like BP or not depends to a large extent on what kind of people YOU are. I also noticed that many of the malcontents never mentioned tipping, and the favourable reviewers did (hmmm, there could be some cause-and-effect at work there). We were a group of four ... husband (me) 51 and wife 45, plus two girls both 16 .... from Ontario. I am an experienced Caribbean traveller, having been on about 18 different islands and Mexico and Venezuela and Florida. The teenagers were tropical rookies, having been to Florida but nothing else. AIRPORT - Try to get a flight that goes into Punta Cana Airport which is 25 minutes away from the resort. We flew into La Romana Airport which is a good two hours away. Ay caramba!BRING: (a) an insulated drink container for the beach (b) US$20 per person for the departure tax (c) US$10 per person for the tourist card (unless it's included in the price of your package) (d) a stack of American singles for use as tips (about 50 per person is probably enough) (e) enough American money or travellers cheques for shopping and casino, since bank machines give pesos not dollars. Men require long pants for dinner. There is no dress code for women. ACCOMODATION: This is a huge property. Despite the easy and efficient tram system, your enjoyment of this holiday will depend very much on what villa you are staying in. If you like the beach and/or the party pool, you should insist on villas 1-10 or 28-39 or the platinum villas (70-81). If you like the quiet pool and the spa and the lobby and shopping, then villas 48-65 would be better for you. In the middle are villas 11-28 and 36-47 and 66-69 and 82-86. PLATINUM UPGRADE: If you can afford it, this is definitely worth considering. Benefits are many. There is a Platinum Lounge containing free internet, a private bar, restaurant booking service, couches, bigscreen TV, and a very helpful staff. They treat you like royalty. They do private expedited check-in and check-out. You get premium liquors, 3 bottles in your room, cigars, bathrobes, slippers. You get a free 20 minute massage each, and a free snorkeling trip each. You get a dinner at Licey's for free (everyone else has to pay extra for this higher-end dining. Somewhat intangible (but real) is the respect and attentive service that the platinum wristband commands. SIGN-IN: If (like us) you cannot get platinum or choice of room location at time of purchase, your remedy is to try to upgrade when you get to the front desk. Don't deal with whoever is behind the counter; they have insufficient English ability and authority and computer skills. Ask for the shift manager. Tell him you want to upgrade to platinum, and/or change your location. Even if no platinum rooms are available, you can buy platinum services in a regular room. Hold a US$20 in your hand as you chat. You will get what you want if it's remotely possible. If so, shake hands; it's the best twenty you'll ever spend. ROOMS: I read tripadvisor complaints of bugs and leaks and noises and smells. Maybe somewhere sometimes. However, our room was perfect. Everything worked. No smells or leaks or bugs. There was always hot water and water pressure was fine. I particularly liked the tiled terrace with two comfortable chairs and a table. A music source in the room would have been nice. You might want to bring one. The maid service was excellent ... twice a day ... plenty of towels ... turn-down service ... all totally unobtrusive. And yes, there are face cloths. For each of our two rooms, we tipped $5 the first day, and $2 a day thereafter. We also brought some coloured pencils and colouring books from Canada, which we gave her for her children. GROUNDS: Wow. They must have armies of gardeners. This resort is physically very beautiful and lush. In the central area, peacocks, geese, ducks and flamingoes stroll or swim. There is a mangrove swamp, which is interesting if a little stinky. STAYING HEALTHY: Tap water is undrinkable. That means keeping your lips sealed in the shower, and using bottled water even for brushing your teeth. All drinks and ice are safe. No one in our group got sick. We heard of some others who did, but not many. BEACH: This is one of the most beautiful beaches you'll ever see. It's not quite Magen's Bay (St. Thomas) or Horseshoe Bay (Bermuda), but it's close. White sand. Azure water. No rocks. Clean beach. Not too calm and not too wavy; just right. Snorkeling is non-existent off beach, and poor on the nearby off-shore reef. There are few vendors, and they are not aggressive at all. The beach is miles long, and open and walkable throughout. At BP, the beach is quite deep as well, which allows the crowd to spread out more than some adjacent resorts where the beach is narrower. There are enough loungers, but if you insist on shade under a palapa, you have to get out there early (like, by 7 a.m. at least) to leave your towel and book on the right lounger. The Animation staff work the beach in the morning, and wow are they animated. Oh yes ... the beach is optionally topless ... although our collective observation was that the women who go topless generally shouldn't, and the ones who could generally don't. POOLS: There are two pools. The quiet pool up by the lobby seems to attract seniors and families with little children and readers. The party pool by the beach has a swim-up bar and water sports and Animation staff (in the afternoon).BARS: The reviewer who said there were only two bars obviously carries a white cane. I found 11 different bars, and there are probably more in places I never went. The blender drinks are not the best in the Caribbean, I have to say. However, Reuben at the swim-up bar makes a mean Margarita. Montegro at the beach bar makes a cool Secret Surprise (there is blue curacao in it for sure [it's blue], but otherwise who knows? One of his secret ingredients is in an Amaretto bottle, but it's not Amaretto). RESTAURANTS AND FOOD: The biggest gripe on tripadvisor reviews is the quality of the food. Here's my theory. If you are a high-end gourmet, you will be disappointed. If you are the kind of person who limits their food intake to hamburgs and hot dogs and french fries and you think the rest of the world should cater to you, you will be disappointed. However, the gourmets should be going to more expensive more exclusive resorts, and the rednecks should stick to Florida. For the rest of you, you will have no problem finding more than enough to eat. As a person who likes all types of food, I would say that the best restaurants for quality and service combined are Gaucho, Licey's, and Hispaniola. The worst are Pescador and Bella Pasta. In the middle are Sakura and Chopin (although those two have the best and most romantic location, being on a little island in the middle of a lake). Breakfast tip: stay away from the scrambled eggs self-serve tray (weird) and have the omelette (custom-made, fresh and delicious). Lunch tip: the beach BBQ table has magnificent chicken and ham and steaks every day, with sides. PEOPLE: The tourists are predominantly Canadians, with Europeans being the second-largest group, followed by Americans. The multi-cultural mix is great. You'll hear English, French, German, Spanish, plus others. Meanwhile, the Dominican staff are very very friendly. Spanish is their language, and their ability to converse in English ranges widely from nil to good. Most are quite limited in English. They very much like it when an obvious anglophone tries to speak Spanish, and I recommend learning some basic phrases before you go. They also offer spanish lessons on the beach every morning.SPA: It is very tastefully decorated, with a Zen quality to it. My wife and I had the side by side massages, which were wonderful. The teenagers had manicures as well as massages, and liked both. NIGHTLIFE: Every night the Animation staff (who apparently need no sleep) put on a show. Some like these shows, others don't. The lobby area has a bit of a party feel to it every night, before and after the show. The teenagers we were with enjoyed about half the shows but recognized that the lip-syncing was very noticeable. Up the road 100 yards, just outside the gate, is the Princess Tower Casino, which contains the disco. The Casino has slots, about 6 blackjack tables, plus roulette and craps. Most BJ tables are $5 minimum. They offer the surrender rule, which some jurisdictions don't. Dealers speak very little English. Drinks are free if you are playing (tip the waitress). The disco is empty till about 12:30 and then throbbing till whatever. If you want a better disco, ask the animation crew and they'll guide you to a disco a little off the resort but its way better (says the teenagers). TEENAGERS: okay so my daughter who is one of the 16 year olds that came with us is writing this one so here she goes. Hey everyone! okay so the first few days for the teens is always a bit lousy until you start to meet people which usually happens at the disco or in the main lobby at night. Note that the animation crew, waiters, trolley drivers (who will WANT you to come on their trolley and pull over anywhere for you and stop anywhere if you say so) and the bartenders LOVE teenage girls that will talk to them or attend the disco with them. My friend and I were friends with lots of them and they will drag you out to learn the dance in the mornings on the beach, sit beside you at the shows and talk to you throughout the entire thing, and get to know your names and how you're enjoying yourself. Oh, and they love to compliment you so beware and get ready. I LOVED Bavaro Princess. We were able to find a whole crew from the states and hung out with them almost every night over drinks  at the disco. Conclusion, i was very sad when i came home since this meant I was back in cold Canada when the day before, I was partying with everyone and tanning on the beautiful beach. I would go back this minute if someone asked me to and i bet my friend who came with me would hop on board too. best vacation i've ever been on! BOTTOMLINE: Great holiday for all four of us. Good value for money. We'd go again.

<Content>This hotel is amazing! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from March 9-16, 2007. I was a little apprehensive after reading all the bad reviews, and I am posting this review to tell anyone thinking of staying here not to worry-this place is beautiful! We loved the winding, scenic trails throughout the property, and our room was a minute's walk from the beach and pool, an ideal location. If you don't like to walk a lot, there are trams that run every 5 minutes to take you around. The beach is breathtaking, and the weather was great. The food was really good, especially at Sakura and El Gaucho. We did not get sick, and we ate everything...just remember, alcohol and fruit drinks mess with your stomach too, so it's not always the food that makes people sick. Also, if you travel with Apple Vacations, I would definitely recommend going to their evening beach party-it was delicious! Everything was clean, and unlike some negative reviews, we did not see a single bug anywhere in our room. Tip the maids and the bartenders and they will take great care of you. The people who said the service was bad probably didn't tip and would complain about every little thing anyway. The employees work really hard to serve you, and if you have to wait a little while for service, well, you're on vacation! One thing-plan on being ready to check out at least 15 minutes earlier than what the hotel tells you, because the check-out line was huge and we almost missed our transfer to the airport. Other than that, our stay was wonderful, so please ignore all the bad reviews and plan on having a great trip!

<Content>Best vacation ever!! Stayed at the Bavaro Princess from Feb 25th to March 11th and had the best time!! I would like to thank Francelia for making our wedding more than what we dreamed, Pineao the beach bar tender for being the funniest and personable person we have ever met and all the other staff at this hotel that work so hard to make our stay so wonderful!! The resort is beautiful and huge, if your worried about the size there are trolley's that come by every few minutes or if you can walk its really quite nice and from one end to the other only about 10 mins. The rooms are large and very clean, did not have any trouble with water pressure or temp. We only saw one cockroach in the entire two weeks we were there. Restraunts: El Pascador (Seafood), good food but small portions, also one of the most popular so if you plan on eating there you have to make the reservation about 2-3 days ahead.Bella Pasta (Italian): Service here for whatever reason is really slow, but food is very good, I highly recommend the Spinach crepe and Carbonera pasta, my favorite the entire stay.El Gaucho (Steakhouse): Food and Service were excellent here, the Ceaser salad was fantastic and the beef steak was to die for!Sakura (Asian): Good Food, alright service. Worth going to for the atmosphere.Chopin (International Buffet): This was my husband's favorite, definatly try the pasta station and grilled shrimp...superb.Hispanola (Lobby Buffet): Different theme every night so you never got bored. Definatly try Mexican night...so good!The beach was the most amazing thing, the waves are quite big , so not really great for small children but awesome for boogy boarding. We spent more time in the ocean than the pool.The Pool's are very clean and nice when your looking to dip into some cold water to cool down.Overall an excellent vacation, please do not hesitate to stay here as I really dont' think you can leave there dissapointed!

<Content>The only vacation i ever starved on! I'm typically the type of traveler that does not stay in resorts. My little sister was getting married in Punta Cana and all the guests arranged their travel plans through the same travel agent. We all stayed in the Bavarro Princess Hotel. My first problem was that after a long trip from New York to Punta Cana, we were not able to immediately check in to our room. We got to the Hotel at 11am and couldn't check in until after 3pm. We were hungry naturally but couldn't eat until 12:30. The only thing available to eat was basically fast food...burgers and fries that weren't even as good as Mcdonalds. At 12:30 there was a buffet that reminded me of school lunch. We finally checked into our room and found out that if we wanted to eat anything outside of the buffet we had to make reservations. But by the time we got settled in our room and made it to the reservation desk it was too late. The manager actually said to us that he didn't care because he still gets paid the same!!! That was a friday. Breakfast on Saturday stopped being served at 10. We were so tired we slept in as people do on vacation so we missed it. Thank god Saturday evening was the wedding because at least we had some good food. We fought tooth and nail to get a reservation for all of us Sunday night at one of the restaurants on the resort. After spending yet more of our vaction time arguing to get a reservation, we go to the restaurant and it is basically empty. One night we lost our room key. It took two calls from my mothers room and 1 hour to get a replacement key. In our wedding party there were complaints of slow service to fix various things that were broken in all of the rooms. The sheets smelled like cigarettes. One persons room had no AC for two days. The nice things were that it is visually a beautiful place...the beach, the wild animals running around, the palm trees and coconuts everywhere. The pool is nice and the bar is truly the only thing that is pretty much always open although the drinks are watered down.

<Content>Okay Resort We stayed from March 3 - 12th - We had a wonderful time and we were Platinum which I do recommend as it makes check in and out very simple and gives you the feel of a special guest. It was worth it to get a beer in a bottle as well. To Juan and Martires at the Plat Club, fabulous job, you made the trip that much more special. As to the hotel itself, it does need an upgrade, its in some poor health in the rooms but its liveable. We did not have hot water until the last 3 days of our stay, but bear in mind, its 3rd world systems and the fact the entire resort showers at that time of day, so its ok. The worst part of the stay, we had to set an alarm to get up to go get a shade umbrella and chairs. There is not enough shade. Never thought I would ever stoop to this, but it became the if you can't beat them, join them. You will be amazed how many are out doing the same thing each morning. More shade is needed for this resort. The food is okay, nothing marvelous to write about there. I would rate this place about a 4 star. If you have ever stayed at a RIU or a Melia hotel, this one seems very low scale. If you have not stayed at one of those chains, this will be a 5 star to you. Enjoy your trip. Unfortunately, I will not recommend this resort for the food, umbrellas and room quality reasons based on the $$ value. You can stay at much better for around the same dollars. The beach and water is stunning there. Keep in mind, its windy in Punta Cana so the ocean can be rough for a few days with large waves. We did eat at the Chopin and Pescador...so / so. Not much options and the flavor was ok. Buffet had more options. Others near us did them all and loved most, so its really individual taste and what you want do do in the evgs etc. We were there for the beach, sun, relaxation and no time schedules and for that a wonderful time was had.

<Content>loved this facility This is a beautiful resort and is maintained to a very high standard. Wife and I stayed march 5-12 and had a wonderful time. Our room was immaculately clean and the our sheets were changed every day. Our water pressure was a little low when we arrived but improved as the week progressed. Now, to the food. For the most part the buffets at the beach and at reception building were excelllent. Also the Chopin restaurant was quite good with an outstanding pasta bar. Astep lower is the Gaucho steak restaurant. The cuts of meat are not quite up to what Americans are used to.The Licey was not available to us but was supposedly very good. The rest of the restaurants are simply awful. The food in the italian and japanese restaurants was unsatisfactory.No bread in an Italian restaurant? And every where the coffee service was slow to nonexistent . I have traveled extensively and would recommend this hotel to anyone. Just be aware that some of the restaurants are a bit dicey and have a great time.

<Content>I didnt want to leave We have already talked about going again.Getting up early on vacation is really worth it when you see a sunrise on this beach.We went for long walks every morning and the Princess beach was by far the largest and cleanest.

<Content>I would definitely recommend this place!!!! I don't know where the bad reviews come from ??I stayed here from March 3rd to 10th with my wife and 14 month-old son. This place is absolutely beautiful, green everywhere! The staff were all very nice. The food at the main buffet was OK. But its a buffet what do you expect? The BBQ at the beach was excellent and the breakfast at the beach and main buffet was also very good. We ate a lot of different things and never felt sick.The rooms are very spacious. I did not see one bug in our room at all. Although we did see a small geiko lizzard at one point. But that's to be expected they're everywhere and they are harmless.THe beach and pool are amazing !! I would definitely recommend the resort and would go back anytime!!!

<Content>Best Week of my life My family and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess for 1 unforgetable week. We emediately noticed the amazing service as soon as we landed in the airport. The guides were all very funny and good humored.The hotel lobby is magnificent, warm and welcoming and our room was simple yet very comfortable. Beach and pool access is easy and fast. The beach is beautiful, clean and always busy with activities and games.The entertainers are THE BEST, all of them great people and fun to get to know. They make you feel special and they seem to take extra care in remembering names and even your Dart Game score from earlier that day.The food is fine, and served with care. Again, the waiters are all smiles.If you go to this resort, be sure to check out the nighty show in which a group of very talented dancers, comedians and entertainers preform. Every night is a new show!And last of all, my biggest recommendation would be to take a few merengue and salsa lessons before entering the Dominican Republic, because you never know when someone will pull you out of a croud to dance!Bavaro Princess is a 6 star resort in my opinion, with some of the nicest staff members whos smiles, dancing, laughing and love make it very difficult to leave.

<Content>Wonderful Resort!!! My best advice would be just go and enjoy and don't pay much attention to the negative reviews. I was stressing out before we left after reading all of the negative reviews. I honestly don't have one complaint. No, English is not the staff's first language! Hello, you are in the Domincan Republic. I thought everyone at the resort did a fantastic job with their English. Everyone that works there is super friendly. The food was excellent! Yes, there were some things I wasn't crazy about but I could always find something I liked. Only tried one of the restaurants but preffered the buffets. I have a pretty sensitive stomach and never had any GI probs. I ate the cheeseburgers on the beach and they were terrific. I think people go on vac here and eat, drink and spend all day in the sun and it doesn't sit well with them. Its quite easy to go overboard!! I had to make a trip to the MD at the resort..absolutely nothing to do with the food and it was a pleasant experience. The Doctor was very professional and very, very helpful. I work in a hospital and was very satisfied with the experience. I paid $200 for the visit and the meds and my insurance is paying for it in the states. Even if they didn't pay for it the $200 was very resonable and is what I would pay in the states w no insurance.There are bars everywhere and I never, ever had a hard time getting a drink. I can't imagine someone waited 10 mins for a cocktail?? I was very impressed with everything at the resort!! It was very, very clean and would go back again. Enjoy your trip and don't freak out about the negative reviews like I did!!!

<Content>Great Place-Horrible Food I have read all the reviews and I agree with majority of the people. The place is awesome. Try if you can to get a Platinum Package, you will get little privileges like a free 20 min massage or cigars in your room, slightly better rooms, though they are all great and you can get any alcohol beverages at the bars, whereas some other packages have limits. We have booked our vacation through Apple Vacations and I must say, they were very organized and I would highly recommend them. All the paperwork arrived on time, the transfer from and to the airports were without delays, extremely friendly staff and they ever have a desk at the hotel in case you have questions during your stay. The resort itself is really nice with a beautiful beach. You will enjoy every minute. The one downfall of our entire stay and I can see from other reviews wasn't only ours -the worst food ever. Everything looked tasty but it was just simply horrible. First, they cook everything in a coconut oil; they add no species, so even the best seafood was tasteless. Any dish you get, and there was 5 or 6 restaurants buffet style so eat all you want-it was just bad. Other than that, if you stay for a week, book some great tours they offer-it is a lot of fun, enjoy the sun and your stay in Dominican Republic.

<Content>Great Place After reading many, many reviews on this place, I was very hesitant to stay here. However, my fears were quickly laid to rest. The grounds were impeccable - the maintenance workers daily took care of everything. The landscaping was beautiful. The hotel is a huge complex; we were lucky enough to have our room centered in this place - we were half way to the lobby and half way to the beach. Because my husband and I like to walk; we did so, however, the trams ran very often, and if you wanted to ride, you could. We had no trouble with any of the employees whatsoever. In fact, we often commented how nice everyone was. The food was not the best - but we're in a foreign country, so I can handle watching what I eat and did not go away hungry from any place where we ate. Best meal: El Gaucho - the Argentian steak was to die for!! We ate at El Gaucho 2x just for the steak. Make your reservations early in the day or for the whole week, if you want. The Italians restaurant was good also! We also ate the nightly buffets if we did not have reservations anywhere else - it was fine! I felt the pool could have been cleaner, but then you have people coming in from the beach and going right into the pool - they did not bother to wash their feet off at the many places you could - so go figure!! Lunch at the party pool - hamburgers were great. Went to the spa - WONDERFUL - and the prices were very reasonable. After 4 days in the salt water and sea, the massage with oils was very much appreciated. The quiet pool near the main lobby was very nice - we spent 3 days there - it was nice to get away from the partying mode. The room was okay - no problems with hot water like I had read from other people. I do not go on vacation to spend my time in the hotel room. And the beach in Punta Cana is the best I've ever been to. The entertainment crew at the pool was great - these guys definitely go out of their way to make sure everyone is having fun. We definitely had a great time here and I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel, Beautiful Beach and Relaxing Atmosphere I have to admit that I was nervous about what to expect at the hotel upon arrival due to all the bad reviews I read online before leaving. I wanted to take the time to share my great experience so that people do not get the wrong idea about this hotel. To begin, I will address what many reviews seem to say are the weaknesses: Food and Rooms.We spent 5 nights at the hotel and never had to eat at a buffet for dinner. We got a la carte reservations for every night at normal eating hours (between 7 and 8:30). Nobody in my party got sick. I have a chronic stomach problem and was so worried about geting sick having read the reviews but the food really was good. For dinner, the steakhouse and italian (ate there twice) places were good, and the service was just fine with the meal taking about 1- 1 1/2 hours from the time we sat down. I would recommend getting pasta at the italian restaurant. Both of these restaurants were not air conditioned. We also ate at the Japanese restaurant twice. This restaurant is air conditioned AND the service was GREAT! We did not try any of the extra cost places since the other options provided us with great food.Lunch- the grilled chicken by the beach was GREAT! Better than what I make on my own grill at home.Breakfast- I am not a big breakfast eater, but it looked like there were pleanty of options. I stuck with toast and jam since thats mostly what I do at home.Rooms- our room was fine. Yes, the rooms could use some touching up on the paint BUT as long as you do not go expecting 1000 thread count and four seasons atmosphere I do not think you will be upset. Some people mention a terrible odor. THere was a scent to our room but it was not bad and it essentially impossible to have no scent in such a tropical humid environment. We both have allergies but had no problems due to our room. THere was always lots of hot water and the shower had great water pressure (believe me, I hate bad water pressure).Also, we did not go platinum and we felt no need to. The staff was attentive to us and we had no complaints about service at all. The pool is very nice and the grounds are just immaculate. The beach in front of this hotel is the nicest on that streatch of beach with a nice big sandy beach and very very very little seaweed.Hope this is helpful. I would definately consider returning to the same hotel and would suggest this as a great location to visit.

<Content>excellent amenities, average service This is a truly beautiful resort, very large but walkable and there is a tram. The beach is outstanding though there aren't enough huts (umbrellas) nor enough trash bins. The bins they had were very small and always full, the wind blew trash around. There was coffee and tea self service available but no cups were ever there. You have to ask for it to be served and they are slow. The beer should be self serve also, as you have to wait for many mixed drinks to be made before your turn to get a beer.Our suite was nice, the bed comfy and the view lovely. There are two steps to the bath and to the bedroom, not good at night if you are not too good on your feet. We needed the sliding closet door fixed and a leaky sink drain and the toilet seal leak fixed. They were all fixed the day after we called. The sewage plant is too close to the resort so the odor is sometimes a problem. Our room was not too close to it.The food was very good. They had many special events during the day and for dinners. The ocean is a little rough and the pool was outstanding. The weather was great.

<Content>bavaro princess middle of the road We have also stayed at IFA (Low end) and Secrets (High End) and I would definitely say this was middle of the road. My husband liked the food but I was very cautious of it from previous reviews. I saw what others in food industry saw -food being kept to temp with lights, not fire. Stay away from anything cooked that wasn't dry to begin with. Pasta is fine but stay away from the burgers. We were lucky and got room 038 without even asking. The room's balclony looks directly on the beach. If you speak spanish at the front desk it certainly helps. If you don't, don't expect any favors. Same as would be in the US. Best bar by far is the larger pool bar on the upper side. MAXIMO will be your best friend there. Worth getting to know him. The beach side bar takes 10 minutes longer. Only saw the lobby bars at night. Entertainment was geared more for kids from what we saw, of course we go to bed early these days. If you are booking thru Apple tours, skip the transport back on the bus and take a taxi. Only $30 for 2 people and you get 2 extra hours on the beach before you leave. Same thing with every resort. As far as food - be smart! the 2 other resorts we stayed at had NO complaints about food. We took plenty of chips and cookies with us from home so we were never lacking for safe food.

<Content>Great Experience!!! Reading some of these negative reviews, it seems as though we stayed at a different resort altogether...I'm 23, my boyfriend is 29, we stayed at the Bavaro Princess for a week and had an absolutely fantastic time!! As mentioned in some previous reviews, keep in mind that you are travelling to a 3rd world country so obviously things are going to be a lot different if you're not an experienced traveller. That said, it is still definitely a good time. The resort is quite large, with beautiful, well maintained grounds. We stayed in room building 53, room 532, which is right by the buffet restaurant main building. There is also a pool right outside as well which is fantastic. I would really recommend this area (if you are not picky about an ocean view or anything like that) as it is very accessible to all amenities. The walk to the beach from here is only 10 minutes or so and you enjoy all the beauty of resort. Or, if you prefer, the tram is right there too and it will take you straight there - we walked every time and it was great. Our room was impeccably clean and everything worked fine. There were no bugs in it whatsoever and the housekeeping service was fantastic. The water pressure was the same as at home and there was always hot water, not that you really need it, but it was always there and didn't run out. The people at the resort are great, very friendly and always willing to help. Remember that their main language is Spanish, but most of them speak English and French as well. If you have issues with language barriers, what country would this not happen in if you weren't familiar with the local language? Neither my boyfriend or I speak any Spanish but we managed fine since the barternders, waiters/waitresses, and almost all other hotel staff spoke English.The beach is absoutely beautiful and was always great to be at. It is really busy there from about 10am to 2pm so during that time, it is really hard to find a spot under an umbrella, or even any chairs at all. I would suggest to wait until after 2 when it becomes less busy and you can find a spot to relax. The big pool with the swim (or wade) up bar is right behind the beach and is very relaxing also. Lots of beach chairs and umbrellas around here too but same issues with the time of day. The food is something that lots of people have had issues with and it really is not as bad as some people experienced. The one thing that I would definitely recommend however, is to stay away from any hamburger - whether at the hotel restaurant or the beach/pool snack bar. They are always pink and you would probably get sick if you ate a whole one. We had a couple undercooked experiences when we ordered them and after a few bites that was it. We didn't get sick from them though, because we were sensible enough not to eat them. Would you eat a pink burger at home? The main buffet at the resort is great, a lot to choose from and very attentive staff. There are also 4 other restaurants to go to on the resort but we didn't try any of them so I can't say anything about that. All in all, it was a fantastic experience and my boyfriend and I both agreed that would take the trip again. I am a very experienced traveller but this was his first trip ever - and he had no complaints. Please don't be scared off by the negative reviews, they are most likely isolated incidents and could happen anywhere. Feel free to email me with any questions at dara_m@telus.net as there is still lots that I can tell you that I haven't included in this review - it was long enough, don't you think?!

<Content>Gorgeous Resort, GI problems My husband, in-laws, and I traveled to the Bavaro Princess in June of last year. The resort, restaurants, pools, and beach were above average. The problem was, three out of four of us were stricken with GI symptoms -- we later found out related to the Alaska bottled water which tested positive for E.Coli. Be prepared with Immodium and perhaps an antibiotic (ie. Cipro) as Immodium is $1/pill and it is $130/person to see and be treated by the onsite physician. We have previously traveled to Mexico and Aruba without problems. Hopefully, this was a one time occurrence. It will not, however, deter us from returning to this country and/or resort!! Happy travels!

<Content>Had a Great time, this place is beautiful! My wife and I just got back from Bavaro Princess last night. We stayed from Feb 25th - March 4th. I will go into as much detail as possible because my memory is still pretty fresh as we just got home 12 hrs ago.We tried to upgrade to a platinum room, but they were all sold out for the week. However, they did allow us to upgrade to platinum service, but stay in our room. This cost around $23 per person per day. This gives you access to the plainum lounge which meant free web access, free premium drinks including miller and budweiser beer. You can make all your dinner reservations here as well. You get a lot of other ammenities as well, robes, slippers, booze in your room, etc. We felt it was a nice upgrade but our trip wouldnt have been any worse if we didnt upgrade. If you want to be treated like a vip, then do the upgrade. First of all, this place is huge, 95 acres. If you don't like walking or riding on the trams, dont go here. We didnt mind either and had no problems getting around. Luckily we stayed in bldg 36 which was a 3 minute walk to the beach. All the bldgs in the 70's and 30's are very close to the beach. If we forgot something, we could just walk back to the room. Other rooms that were farther away would have to take the tram, which only takes a couple minutes. The grounds are unbelievable. Greenery everywhere, palm trees everywhere. Everything is beautiful and well kept. Groundskeepers were everywhere making things look good.The beach is awesome. Best beach we have ever been to  we have been to cancun, puerta vallarta, cozumel, grand caymans  playa del carmen. White powdery sand with no sea shells or seaweed. The white sand goes as far as your eye can see in both directions. The security keeps all the peddlars off the beach so we did not get haggled at all while on the beach.We ate at both buffets and thought the food was great. They had a huge variety and everything tasted fine. You have to keep in mind that you are in Punta Cana, not at home. Food is prepared different and tastes different. However, there is enough regular food to satisfy anyone's tastes. You could always grab a burger, hot dog or pizza if you want some regular food. We ate everything in site and did NOT get sick. We even saw quality control guys walking around in white lab coats checking things over. They checked temps, cleanliness, etc. Do not be concerned about the quality of food here. Be concerned about getting sick because you drank bahama mamas and coc loco's all day while sitting in 85 degree heat. Thats a sure bet to make you sick unless you are a seasoned drinker. We ate at Licey one night. It was just ok. Not worth the money in my opinion but it was included in our platinum package so we tried it.We ate at Sakura  it was ok too. My wife liked her dish, mine was just ok. El Gaucho restaurant was ok too. We had the argentinian steak which was pretty good. Other than that, nothing too special.I was happy with the main buffet, el hispaniola. Lots of choices and everything was good.There is a lot of bars here. The previous reviewer that said there was only 2 bars must have had blinders on. There is 2 bars by the beach, 1 bar by the main pool, 1 bar by the smaller pool, 3 bars inside the main bldg, 1 bar in the platinum lounge and a bar inside each restaurant. Finding a drink was never a problem. The casino was good. Its not huge like a vegas casino but what do you expect? We played craps and blackjack  ended up even money after 2 nights. I lost it all and my wife won it all back. All in all, it was a nice casino.There isnt much nightlife at this place. We found the 10pm shows to be rather lame but there wasnt much else to do at night other than gamble. We did not check out the disco inside the casino. I heard it was loud and dead inside so we never went in.Odds and ends:Most of the guests here are canadian or european. English speaking is definately the minority. Speaking spanish would make things easier although we enjoyed trying to translate. If you are expecting 100 % english speaking staff, do not go here.The rooms are all suites but could use some updating. They were not bad but starting to show some wear on the inside. We did not see a single bug in our room and I was looking. I shook the curtains  I checked the sheets. Nothing, nada, zip. Although I wouldn't have been shocked if I did find a bug because the resort is covered with greenery, there should be bugs everywhere. I never even got a mosquito bite while here. My wife got a pedicure at the spa for $23 which included nail polish. She enjoyed it and thought it was a great deal. We both had free 25 minutes massages here as well as part of our platinum package which was very nice.We also got a free snorkeling excursion with our platinum upgrade which was just ok. The boat ride out to the snorkeling spot was rather rough. Once we got there, the reef and the fish were average. No where near as nice as Mexico. It was free, so no big deal. I dont think I'd pay for that one though.Bottom line, if you are looking for a nice caribbean resort and you aren't a picky, anal traveler, this place will be fine for you. If you expect to be pampered or waited on like a superstar, the Dominican republic may not be for you. This place is all about relaxing.Do not be swayed by some of these negative reviews, take what you read with a grain of salt. This is a nice place where you will have fun if you are not extremely picky.

<Content>Excellent place Our group of six adults stayed at the Bavaro Princess from Feb. 2 -16 / 07 We did the Platnum Club upgrade and we all felt it was worth the little extra $$$. The platnum lounge gave us a place to meet the rest of our party and have a relaxing drink before diner. The desk clerk Juan was one of the nicest most caring individuals we have ever met at any resort. He would always have a big smile and was truly curious to know how we were doing and if there was anything else that could be done to make our stay better. Juan would often sit with us when he wasn't busy and share alot of information about his country. Our experience with all of the staff from the poolboys, gardeners, tram drivers, maids and wait staff was unbelievable. We always treated the staff with respect for the hard work and long hours they did for very little pay. One thing I would suggest before you go is to figure out in advance how much you are willing to tip per day for the duration of your trip. We brought a bunch of U.S. $1.00 bills with us, that way we were prepared as soon as we arrived at the airport. Please don't misunderstand me, they don't expect to be tipped and when they are it really puts a big smile on their face.Don't be too concerned about some of the negative reviews you may have read. The food in all restaurants was always good if you used common sense. If at any time we weren't sure about what we were eating we'd simply put it down and not eat it. A couple of people in our group did complain about upset stomachs and diarhea at some point during their time there. I'm sure if we were to eat and drink that much at home we'd suffer the same. Pace yourself, and if in dought put it down.We saw small ants wherever food or drinks were spilled. I only saw 3 or 4 mosquitos in the two week period so for me it wasn't a concern.In a nutshell I see it like this; if you go looking for flaws you'll find them. For us, we had read alot of reviews and truthfully were a little worried that we had chosen the right resort. We decided that it was to late, the tickets were bought so we would make the most of it and go with a positive carefree vacation attitude. As it turned out this one of the best vacations we have ever had. We look forward to the day we can return!

<Content>Great resort, Food terrible We stayed at this resort Feb. 23rd-March 2, 2007. Thought the resort was great except for the food. The resort is spread out and the rooms were very quiet. We were located right where the trams went by and never heard a word. Nicest beach we've ever been to. You could take long walks and never have to worry about stepping on anything bigger than a grain of suger (in the water and out). No bugs. Entertainment was good. Could use some updates in the room, no washcloths, and some switches that didn't work, but overall very satisfied. The food was some of the worst food I've ever tried to eat. Raw lobster in seafood restaurant, Orange (chef-boyRdee sauce) on speghetti, in Italian restaurant. Didn't even have parmesean cheese. The service in specialty restaurants was also terrible, sometimes only one waiter. We didn't run into one person that didn't complain about food. Beach and drinks were perfect. Grounds were perfect and well maintained. I would go back to Punta Cana in a minute but would opt for a different resort solely on the quality of food.

<Content>Wil never go back We will never return. Very rude staff as well as when we ariived we were up all night killing the cockroaches and in the morning the room was full of little centipedes. They would not even offer a new room even after the staff saw this. The toilet did not flush and no water pressure to take a shower. The ceiling fan was hanging by a bolt and about to fall down. Guys prepare to be very uncomfortable. We were asked to leave while eating dinner because I did not know that you have to wear a full sleeve shirt to have a meal despite the heat and humidity. Very unprofessional to tell us to leave our meal cause of this. Then get a tram to go back to the room to change to go all the way back to the bar wear the buffet is. Prepare to do a lot of walkin. Only 2 bars. 1 at the beach and 1 in the very front entrance. Every one I talked to is just as upset. Mainly about the dress code for men amongst other things.

No complaints here, we loved absolutely everything...room, location, food, drinks, we never made it to the shows however heard they were great, we did however make some reservations to the other Princess's a la carte restaurants which are about a 10 minute ride for dinner and the service (they take you there and bring you back on the trams.....they even wait for you if you are not done....fantastic.....we dont even get this treatment at home)The weather was great first week, second one was so-so, but we didnt care we just made the most of it.All the restaurants were great, service , food, everything, the buffet was great also. And let me add we DID not get sickWe were very sad to leave, we would have stayed an extra week if we could of.We did meet some folks that had bad things to say however we could not understand thier ploblems......pissing and moaning....what was their problem!!! never did figure it out!!!!

<Content>Not the greatest! This hotel is okay but but needs alot of work to be rated a 4 star.Please take my opinion into serious consideration because I have been down south 12 times  I'm not a picky eater either.Grounds: beautiful  alot to see.Food: not very good even compared to Dominican standards.Service: not very good, infact sometimes they were rather rude.Entertainment: not that great  rather boring.Rooms: don't look as good as they show in the pictures, alot of flies as well.Beach: Good but not as good as Varadero's beach.There is a bus that takes arounbd the hotel which is kind of cool but it can get annoying at times when your waiting for it to come.

<Content>From Pittsburgh.... Won't go back! This is my 3rd time to Punta Cana, love the area but did not care for Bavaro. We were there from Feb. 19-24th. The beaches are beautiful at all resorts we have stayed at but with this trip we had terrible weather( which is not the fault of Bavaro). It rained 2 days all day and was cloudy for 3 and windy. We had 1 1/2 days of beautiful sun! We stayed in building 8 and could smell septic everyday, it was terrible. The rooms were very spaceous but are in need of updates. There was a 1/2 inch gap in our door to the balcony, air conditioner made noises all day/night long, not good water pressure, had to beg for washclothes ( take your own). The food was not so great and the service at the two reservation restaurants was terrible. The Bella pasta staff was very friendly but did not come back during our meal to see if we need anything or if we needed anything else to drink. The Chopin was absolutely TERRIBLE, we do most of our drinking at the beach and by dinner time we are ready for water only but when we told our waitress that we wanted water only , she said no .. must have drinky drinky , when we said no she waved her arm , made an ugly face and sounds, turned and left and did not come back to clear plates, see if everything was ok and no refills of water. Very poor service. Our last day we were leaving at 9 pm , we had a checkout of noon, we had everything packed and ready to go but thought we would go to the beach until 11 then go back and get checked out and get my husbands bud light that we bought in town ( he doesn't like Presidente), when we got to our room , our housekeeper was there, she had called and had our bags taken out and took our beer and would not give it back. She just laughed at him when he confronted her. We had taken gifts plus tipped everyday we were there. After arguing with the main manager he finally reimburrsed my husband for what he had paid. We had two of the best bartenders at this resort -Thanks to Montegro and Plinno. We have styed at Iberostar and at the Grand Bahia Principe and had wonderful experiences at both of them. We have not found a place yet that we totally enjoy the food but when I go back I will only stay at the Grand Bahia Principe. It is a two year old resort and was absolutely beautiful. I will never return to Bavaro Princess. The beaches are beautiful at most of the resorts. We did not have a totally bad experience but with what was bad it has turned us off from returning there. It was nice to be able to walk to there town to shop, lots of nice shops to go to plus the casino is just out the gate of the resort.

<Content>Fun In The Sun,  BAVARO PRINCESS ALL SUITES RESORT, DOMINICAN REPUBLICFebruary 25, 2007 - My partner and I spent two weeks at this resort and we really enjoyed ourselves. Grounds keeping was impeccable and there were guys climbing the palm trees and chopping down fresh coconuts. Beach was beautiful and always crowded. Ocean was warm but on some days the waves were stronger and you had to be careful. Lots of recliners and palapas and you can get fresh towels whenever you want one. Five a la carte restaurants to choose from along with the hotel's daily buffet. The El Pescador (seafood -great and service was good), the El Gaucho (Steak - Argentinian was excellent and service was great), Chopin (Buffet - meats were tough), Sakura (Asian) excellent service and food, and Bella Pasta (food was mediocre and service was very poor). Our room was nicely appointed and restocked daily with bottled water (recommended for all your drinking requirements), coke, diet coke, sprite and 3 to 4 bottles of beer. We tipped the maid well and she was excellend in keeping our room fresh with lots of clean towels and creamers for your coffee. Staff was friendly and polite even if they do not speak English very well. Menus, etc. were in English, French, Spanish and German. Met lots of people from Canada, Russia, Germany, Italy, France and some Americans. Two weeks of rest and relaxation was what we needed and received. 95 Acre property well maintained and two pools. The smaller pool near the lobby was quieter and much appreciated. Someday we will go back for another visit. -S.Rushton, Ottawa, Canada

<Content>Wanna Go Back Now!!! Love it so much, wanna go back now! Stayed at the Bravaro Princess Jan 29-Feb.5. We are a family of four with two older teenagers. Went for the beach and relaxation. Booked with Air Canada Vacations and received the platinum package. Flight was great, lots of leg room on plane, even received a hot meal. Had a late flight, arrived 8:40 pm, everything went smooth as silk from the airport to the resort, going through customs very, very quick, shuttle waiting at airport to take us to resort, upon arrival at the resort, received a nice cold drink, representative at lobby greeted us as we arrived to advise us of our room number, luggage tagged with the same, hopped on tram to platinum lounge, upon arriving there offered a nice cool towel, reception gave us our room key and explained all that was included in the platinum package, very well organized. When we got to our room luggage had already arrived. Suites are huge, eating area, sitting area, huge bedroom area, sink area and huge closet and separate tub, shower area. Everything was sparkling clean. Bed and pillows more comfortable then ours at home. Balcony/patio area large and quite comfortable with two loungers. Woke up to a very lush and well groomed resort. Air Canada had organized a orientation at platinum lounge which I would recommend going to for great tips. The platinum lounge was great, we were able to book all our a la carte dinners for the whole week right at the lounge, no long line ups like we saw at the main lobby, lounge stocked with premium alcohol, had my kaluha and milk everyday, and a very nice place to meet others, plazma TV in lounge was great for the Super Bowl, two computers with free internet also available. To a newcomer this resort seems huge, but it is walkable for those who want exercise, but the tram system is a great way of getting around, can be busy around dinner time just be patient and give yourself extra time. The beach, what can I say, it鈥檚 paradise, it鈥檚 lined with huge palm trees and white soft powder like sand. There are plenty of lounge chairs at the beach and yes I would advise those that would like an umbrella on the beach to wake up early and claim your chair, besides what are you here for - sleeping or relaxing by the beach. The beach is cleaned of seaweed every morning and cleaners clean up straws  plastic glasses and general garbage after those that cannot use the several garbage bins located on the beach. For those that cannot clean up after yourself, you won鈥檛 do it in your own backyard, why do you do it here! Have a little respect for this beautiful island. The pool is very nice and large and if you prefer a quieter pool area there is a second located by the main lobby. Most of our time was spent at the beach, we had breakfast and lunch there everyday. The breakfast buffet at the beach is smaller but offers a great variety, you can eat inside or outside, there is nothing better then sitting outside having breakfast and drinking coffee overlooking the ocean. Went to the main buffet for breakfast one day and realized it鈥檚 not worth going since we love the oceanview better. Our teenagers enjoyed the 24hr room service with the platinum pkg, had breakfast on their balcony everyday. The bbq on the beach was our choice for lunch, which included beef, pork,  chicken, rice and a vegetable. You also have the beach buffet or main buffet to choose from. You also have a choice of hamburgers and fries. Heard somebody complain the meats were not cooked enough, well quess what, that happens here at home also. The drinks at the resort are great no matter if you have platinum or not. With the number of people at this resort I was amazed and really impressed they never ran out of ice or fruit mixers like another resort we鈥檝e been to. The slush drinks such as pina coladas and margarietas were never watery and the regular mixed drinks were not watered down, just right. I heard one complaint that he did not like the presidente beer(local beer) so if you are picky about your beer I would suggest platinum is a better choice for you. We went to every a la carte restaurant except Italian and one night to the main buffet. The seafood was our favorite. We never got sick, sometimes I wonder if moderation is the key for those that do get sick. So please be careful, give yourself a break from the sun and go easy on those drinks, the resort is not going to run out of alcohol. Only rained once when we were there, that was at 11 pm and lasted only for about an hour. Our maid service was very efficient, also had lots of clean towels  washcloths  beach towels, had a light out in bathroom, told reception at platinum lounge, fixed in no time. Please disregard all the bad reviews, sometimes I wonder if these people are posting to the right resort as some have similar names. For example, I never saw construction going on beside the hotel. There is a well established resort on each side of this resort. We really enjoyed this resort and would go back in a heartbeat! I would recommend this resort to anyone but try to get platinum because it is nice to treat yourself but if you don鈥檛 I have no doubt you will have a great time. P.S. Found out late flights are great, your last day there is spent all day on the beach!

<Content>The Platinum experience Our group of 22 persons stayed at this resort Feb 10-17. 4 members of the group became very ill and lost 24-48 hours of their expensive vacation (plus the medical bill at the doctor). Don't drink the water is not just a suggestion, and they should include don't eat the food washed with the water. Some couples in our group upgraded to Platinum for valentine week. The best part of the upgrade was checking in and out. with ease  being close to the beach. Getting the imported liquor option that was part of the upgrade was like pulling teeth as they were always trying to smuggle Dominican vodka into our glasses (quite a taste difference). The suites, however gorgeous had bathrooms in need of updating. We had leaky toilets, and bidets and showers without water pressure. Mornings relaxing on the beautiful beach required ear plugs as the excersize leaders blared musica and screamed into microphones. The swim up bar was quite nice for the adults until the kids camp invaded the adult pool space with splashing each afternoon about 4 pm. On the positive side, for those of us able to eat, the food was very tastey and well presented in the many specialty restaurants. The warm water lobster was plentiful in the seafood restaurant and there was no limit on how many times you could dine in each restaurant. The grounds were beautiful and lush with jungle and native birds and flowers. The evening entertainment was above average, and some of us actually won in the casino. For those who liked to walk a lot, there was plenty of opportunity, and for those who did not, the trolleys were frequent to get around the huge complex. There were plenty of opportunities for massage on the beach or in the wonderful professional spa. For those of us from Chicago, the best part about this trip was definately the weather in Punta Cana, but we all felt that we deserved a biigger bang for our buck.

<Content>Super Great Vacation!!!!!!!!! I am beginning to think I was dreaming about the great vacation we had at the bavaro Princess by reading all these negative reviews. I was one in a party of six that went for 8 days(Jan 27 till Feb3) We had a great time from beginning to end. The only think we found we did not like was the scambled eggs on the breakfast buffet. That's not bad for 6 people to find. From the time we got to the resort, it was paradise, we were met with a welcome drink, and even through we got there at 10:00 am and our rooms would not be ready till 3:00, which we knew before we got there, there was no prblem, we just changed in the restroom, and hung out at the pool. Our rooms were very nice,clean, No Bugs, or mold, or anything else that people are saying they found. We did find that there was a shortage of washcloths, but after the first day, the maid and I came to an understanding on that, and after that I got plenty. The staff was very friendly, and helpful when you needed anything. The out back safari trip was the best!!!!! We all had sooooooooo much fun!!!!!! The food was good, not like home, but good!!!!!! We always found something we liked, and you could always get something to eat at anytime of the day. What was nice too, was if you did not want to walk there was always a tram to ride, you never had to wait very long to catch one, I think the longest we ever waited was 5 mins. Just remember if you are in a hurry than this is not the place for you, this is a great place to just lay back and relax, if you are looking for wild and crazy look else where. In our group we wanted low key, and lots of relaxation, which we got on the beautiful beach, and at times we did join in on the activites at the pool, which was good for a laugh. The shows at night were low budget, but they were fun to see, we enjoyed them. We met a lot of very nice people from all walks of life. I know we are all ready to go back in a heartbeat!!!!!!!

<Content>Please do not ignore the MANY bad reviews!!! It is not uncommon for a hotel to receive a few bad reviews here and there, as some people just can not be satisfied. However, I am warning you not to stay at this resort. Our entire party experienced severe stomach cramps and diarrhea basically the entire duration of the trip. And based on the number of people who have also got sick at this resort (just do a simple search yourself), believe me.. there is seriously somthing wrong with the food at this resort. Horrible. Spend your money elsewhere! Don't risk it.

<Content>Terrific time We visited Bavarro Princess 2/12 - 2/16. Weather was perfect! Accomodations and food were great. A few people in our large group of about 40 became ill. Took the horse ride sold at the towel exchange building and had a blast. Would definitely go again, perhaps for longer period of time.

<Content>Fantastic from St. Louis, Missouri My husband and I stayed at Bavaro Princess Feb 1st -Feb 11th 2007. I just have to say that the Resort is beautiful. Everything is clean an very lush with all the greenery an flowers. The wildlife was a bonus peacocks running around parrots ect. We were here last year and stayed at the Grand Palladium which was great also. I cannot understand why people give the rooms a bad review. We where right by the beach the rooms were roomy and kept very clean. The beds they have here at Bavaro were the most comfortable beds I have had in any out of the country hotels. The one disappointment was there was no alcohol in the rooms unless you are platium. The webb site kind of throws you. If you tip the bartenders they will give you the premium liqours and a couple of bottles to take back to your room.If you can get platium go for it . The beach is the very best, it is kept clean and really nobody bothers you.The pool by the beach is the place to go but just to let you know the pool bar closes at 5:00pm. My greatest thanks to Maximo, Rubin, and Diego. They take care of the pool bar and they are the best. We met so many friendly people there and many new friends. The food is okay we liked te Buffet and the seafood resturant the best. We are not that picky of people as long as we have a beautiful beach, a drink in our hands, and a good room were okay with that. The only complaint I have is there is nothing to do at night accept go up to the main lobby bar. They should do something about that. We took a couple of the tours through Apple. The outback safari and the snorkel with the sharks and stingrays. I would suggest them they were both fantastic. The ouback safari takes you inland and you really learn about the country.You stop at a coffee and chocolate plantation. You also go to a dominicians home It is a full day. The resort is big not as big as the Grand palladium but you walk alot and if you do not want to walk they have trams running all the time.I tryed there spa and loved it! Ladies do the chocolate wrap never felt better. If you are smart bring alot of $1.00 dollar bills to tip. They say you do not have to tip but come on these people hardly make any money for all the time they put in. We give them a couple of dollars and they take good care of you. I want to thank are friends John and Marlo for suggesting this resort and meeting us there. Also I want to thank are friends that we met there from Canada Mike and Deb, Step and Finn, and Colin and Tasha. Hopefully we will be seeing you soon. Please take the time to go to this wonderful country and make sure you stay at a resort on Bavaro Beach you will never forget it and like us you will want to go back.

<Content>Bavaro Princess/SunWing - Fabulous Holiday Bavaro Princess 鈥?February 3-10, 2007We just returned from our vacation at the Bavaro Princess. Because of the many negative reviews lately, I will reiterate all the good things that we experienced. I guess some people are very hard to please (or were in a parallel universe). This was our 10th trip to Punta Cana and our 2nd trip to the Bavaro Princess. We will definitely be going back for a 3rd!SunWing AirlinesI was very apprehensive about booking this airline. We were very pleased and would fly SunWing again. The flight out of Ottawa was scheduled for 5:00 am and we left at 5:10 am. We were delayed by 1 hour on our return due to the head count matching up to the manifest.The flight attendants were very friendly and we enjoyed a hot meal down and back. We also had free champagne down and free wine on our return.We were the only airplane at the Punta Cana Airport so we went through immigration and customs very quickly. Also, the Bavaro Princess was the first stop on the shuttle bus.ReceptionWe arrived at the resort at approx. 11:30 am. We had to wait until 3:00 pm for our rooms. This was not a problem, as we expected this would be the case. We had our wristbands and promptly got a drink and something to eat.We had a special check-in area for SunWing Tour passengers so it was quick and easy. All front desk staff spoke excellent English and we had no problems with communicating. We had requested a certain building location ahead of time and we were very happy to learn that we got what we asked for. There were 8 of us traveling and we wanted to be near one another. The resort couldn鈥檛 have been more accommodating to us.A very special thanks to Nicole, Angel and Armando for making our stay so special.RoomsWe were in the regular suites in Building 34, just one building from the beach. The rooms are very spacious and I actually found the bed to be quite comfortable, and the pillows soft.We never had a problem with hot water or water pressure. I took showers twice a day and had hot, hot water each time. Our room was cleaned at different times each day 鈥?never the same time twice!BeachAs usual, the water and beach were fantastic! We had so much fun jumping the waves. It was very disappointing to see bottle caps and small pieces of glass and cigarette butts in the sand. They do their best to clean up each evening, but you had to be careful of where you walked.PoolThis is where all the action is. It is a long, meandering pool in a beautiful setting. There is also a swim-up bar. We chose to spend all of our time at the beach.RestaurantsLobby BuffetThis is the superior buffet (over the beach buffet). Wait staff are more attentive and there is a larger selection of food. We enjoyed it a lot.Beach BuffetWe ate there most mornings because we don鈥檛 typically eat much at breakfast. The wait staff were unattentive and there were never cups and saucers set out on the tables. The food was good, but not as much variety as the lobby buffet.Beach BBQThis is set up right next to the beach buffet. The food there is fantastic 鈥?freshly bbq chicken, steak etc. It was a big hit with everyone. The chicken is mouth-watering.Bella PastaWe had a great meal here. The food was good and a good variety.El GauchoWe ate here twice. Be careful because there are two versions of the menu. I ordered the Beef Filet, which was really good. Unfortunately some of the others didn鈥檛 have it on the menu and ordered the Sirloin steak. They said it was terrible 鈥?tasted like leather. The Argentinian steak was okay, but I really lucked out with the Beef Filet.SakuraThe Asian restaurant 鈥?we had a wonderful time there. The wait staff was very attentive and lots of fun. The food was the best!El PescadorWe didn鈥檛 eat there.ChopinA very nice buffet as well. They have an excellent pasta station where the chef cooked shrimp in garlic butter and served it with a tomato sauce. My husband loved it. Also, they have a fresh, roasted turkey. The meat is freshly carved on your plate. They also have a piano player and singer to entertain you for about 20 minutes. It was a beautiful setting.No one in our group got sick from the food.MiscellaneousFor the first time, we did see mosquitoes. We brought down insect repellant and used it only once. I did kill a couple of mosquitoes in the shower.We chose not to go on excursions, as we just wanted to RR on the beach. It was a lazy vacation and we loved every minute of it.We didn鈥檛 have the Platinum package and don鈥檛 feel it would have been worth our while. We went window shopping at the Bavaro Palace 鈥?every store seems to carry the same items. Because we鈥檝e been to PC so many times, we didn鈥檛 see a need to buy souvenirs.The Dominican people are so happy and friendly. That鈥檚 why we keep going back to this country. We will be going back again next year 鈥?and possibly to this same resort.Everyone we met who worked at the Bavaro Princess was very friendly and did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable.Please don鈥檛 take the negative reviews too seriously. For all the negative reviews, there are 10 times more positive reviews. It is all in what you make of it (and your attitude towards the people who work at the resort!).

<Content>Wedding in Paradise 32 of my friends and family loved this place. We went in 2004 August/Sept and spent 7 wonderful days there. I have been to many resort in the Carribean and this was one of the best family resorts I have seen. Great service, super rooms, good food, great booze!, and clean all around. For 1400$ a head, well worth the trip. There will always be people whose expectations are not met, in this case, I suggest they change there expectations ($1400 is not that much!). Gabriel was our wedding coordinator and did a wonderful job! We would all likely go back!

<Content>Great time at Bavaro Princess We stayed at Bavaro Princess from 1/22/07 to 1/27/07 (3 women ages 43, 43, 70) We thought it was a 4 star resort. We did not have the platinum package. This is our 1st time in Punta Cana. We have been to Cancun area over 10 times. Food - None of us got sick. I was very careful (mostly ate pasta, bread, cheese, chicken  deserts) but the 70YO ate everything鈥攍ettuce, grapes, cold shrimp, sushi, caviar, etc. We ate at Chopin each night but once tried the steak restaurant and hated it. We enjoyed the food at Chopin. Breakfast buffets are terrific. Lunch was at the beach barbeque and was very good. Chopin is beautiful with lots of tropical foliage behind reflecting water and at 8:30 a piano  singer on a small boat comes through. Weather 鈥?The weather was perfect. Only 1 day was somewhat overcast. It was hot in the sun but fine in the shade. The ocean was warm. Beach - The Princess Bavaro beach was the most beautiful we have stayed at. The ocean is incredible beautiful to look at and it is a wide beach. The ocean is various shades of blue 鈥揻rom deep blue to deep turquoise. The first 2 days the ocean was rough and good for boggie boards, the other days it was quite calm and we spent hours in the ocean floating on our noodles(brought from home). Most of the days there was very little seaweed. Some days you had to walk through seaweed to get past the breaker waves. There was very little seaweed on the beach. We never had trouble getting chairs on the beach under the shade huts, although we reserved them by 9:00. The hotel gift shop sells inflatable tubes and rafts. We went on the banana boat which was fun, although the guy went in circles until he dunked me!Pool 鈥?We weren鈥檛 at the pool to much, just for the morning water aerobics, but it was large and very pretty. The water was a bit cold. It had a gradual entrance and was not deep.Alcohol 鈥?We didn鈥檛 drink much alcohol, just some beer and a few fruity drinks which were good.Entertainment 鈥?The nightly entertainment was awful! The nightly shows, (which we enjoyed immensely at the resorts in Cancun), were just horrible at this resort! The sound system was much too loud and had static which made the piped-in music sound screechy. We actually left during some of the shows!Room 鈥?We were on ground floor near beach in room 396. The location was excellent! Our rooms were large but run-down. The mattresses were old and so was the floor and sink tile. The sheets day were old and worn. Twice at night there were large bugs at bathroom sink and one large bug in friend鈥檚 bed when I went to wake her up (That was quite a scene!!!) . The shower water was warm. The coffee in room was great. Outside our room were palm trees and flowered bushes. The maid cleaned our room very well and left us many extra towels and extra blankets and sheets in case we needed to change them. (some sheets are stained and some are knobby and feel sandy) We brought a lot of kids clothes, pens, pencils, medicine, etc that we gave to the maid and she was so happy! We also tipped her well. Excursion: We went on the Outback Safari half day (9:00 鈥?2:00) and loved it!!! Our guide, Nacho was the best! He was very funny and jolly, so we were constantly laughing, even though it was sad to see the poverty of the Dominican People. We brought an entire suitcase of stuff from the USA for the Dominican people and I am so glad we did that. We took our USA items us on this excursion and I felt like Oprah for a day!!! We had children鈥檚 clothes and formula which we gave to an impoverished family. They were so happy they skipped back to their house (really a shack). We brought markers, crayons, pencils, pens, calculators, Neosporin, etc to a school. The children clapped and laughed --- they were so excited! For those who decide to bring stuff, calculators seemed to be extremely desired. Mangrove, Lobby, Tram, etc. 鈥?The hotel grounds are magnificent. We enjoyed all the exotic birds that freely roamed the grounds. The mangroves are beautiful with narrow wooden bridges over water teaming with turtles, fish and birds. The lobby is vast and open air. The tram runs continuously and is a fun way to get around the property. We took the tram a lot due to the 70YO mobility issues.

<Content>Okay Well my husband and I stayed at this hotel for two weeks from Jan.17-31st. It is claimed to be a five star but we truly feel that it's more like a 3. I also read the reviews before we went and but my husband and I are optimistic people and we take everything with a grain of salt. We thought that no matter what it's like we're going to make the best of it, and we did, however;I do have to say that the beach is BEAUTIFUL and the sand is so powdery soft, we loved that aspect. The beach is huge, and like others have said save a chair if you want shade and a good spot, well by the time you save a chair you are far away from everything. You miss out on the entertaintment, your far away from the drinks and food. Not that big of a problem to us but others it might find it annoying.I seriously thought how can you go wrong with a 5 star....the room makes a HUGE difference and I never thought it would have. The beds, yes, are hard, there are nails in the wall but no pictures...weird. Our maid did a horrible job at cleaning the room and when asked her for more towels she didn't like that. A sprite bottle broke on our floor and we moved the coffee table to the side for the maid to clean but she ended up just moving the table back over top of the broken glass. I couldn't believe that just happened. The cockroaches, now don't get me started! They are everywhere, in the shower, in your bed, walking on the floor, in your clothes, in the suitcases...etc....I couldn't believe that. By the second week I was annoyed enough killing them didn't bother me any more...lol. THe fridge was always stocked, but the coffee that was a problem. We had three days without coffee and dead roached all over our floors. Finally I had enough and had to call the front desk for someone else to come and clean our room. It's not like we didn't leave tips, we gave everyone tips no matter what. We also didn't get any towel art....and that was my favortie thing in Mexico was the creative ways of turning your towels into art. But o well.The food....to make this short....we got sick for three days each, and we couldn't eat for thoes three days. We were so bored of the food it was unreal. Usually people gain weight on vacations but both of us actually lost....yeah. They didn't change the buffet style for the two weeks we were there and really weird food options....so like others say stick to the omelets and pastas.We talked with others on excursions we went on and some of them were staying at Baha Principe and Occidential, other 5 stars and they loved it. Their rooms beautiful, pool was big enough to accommodiate the amount of people at the resort, food always different and they said it way yummy....so I don't understand why the huge difference. We met people at our resort and they felt the same way we did.There is also a casino and the night bar is outside of the resort, which the locals are allowed in. We didn't go becuase we felt, from what we heard, it wasn't safe.So, basically I wouldn't come back and yes everybodys tastes are different....but we spent some good coin to come here and felt it wasn't a good experience. We will some day come back to Punta Cana but definately NOT this hotel.

<Content>Stay away The place is nicely located, the sand the beach WOW!Why I'm saying to stay away. There is another resort being built next door. The jack hammer and construction noise is constant all day. Car alarm going on all day. On the first day, when I asked the hotel manager when the construction noises started in the morning and stopped at night, he played innocent and said we have no construction on our site at the moment. We found out that the noise starts early in the morning and goes on until late at night (after 10pm). When we got there, after our flight was delayed for more than an hour, since we had to be at the airport for 2am when we finally got to Punta Cana, needless to say we were exhausted all we wanted to do was snooze for a few hours. Our room was not ready, the main desk promised that our room would be ready within the hour, they kept saying in 30 minutes (don't believe what they say). We finally got the keys to our room at 4:30pm. The rooms (ours and my sons) smelled like mold and you can't get that smell to go away. For some reason, unknown to me or my husband, we were told that they have given us upgraded rooms and not what was requested. We had a jacuzzi, which didn't work, no decor on the walls the nails were there but the picutres missing, a queen size bed as hard as the floor and we found some bugs in our sheets. We were at the main entrance area far from the beach. The maid doesn't always show up (even if you leave a tip every day), clean your own room and bring your own towels. I spoke with hotel manager and but that didn't help and the Sunwing rep couldn't care less. We had requested two joining room with 4 beds, with sitting area and kitchenette, near the beach, not at all what we got. The food is only good if you go where they make it for you, stick to the pasta and omelets and you should be fine. I didn't and got really sick. We saw cockroaches near the main buffet area. As others have said, the service is not great. Certainly not a 5 stars. You do have to reserve early for a seat in one of the restaurants. It maybe worth it if you want a nice quiet dinner but the food, not great.At the beach although there are a zillion chairs, people reserve them with their towels and walk away. We enjoyed the beach in the morning but chairs were already reserved for the afternoon, which made it a challenge to find a spot in the shade.I can't understand is the nightly shows at 10pm. A few nights the resort had a band playing and people were having a great time dancing. But the band stopped at 10pm so the show could start, I don't know why they bother, these shows are terrible. There is a lot of emphasis put on the decor and costumes but not on the production of the show. Don't waste your time, go walk the beach instead.All in all, what a big waste of my money and time. I won't go back.

<Content>Had a perfect week My wife and I spent 7 days (Jan. 22-Jan. 29) at the Bavaro Princess Resort. This was our 5th trip to Punta Cana, but our first time at the Bavaro Princess. We both feel that each resort has certain pluses and minuses. The grounds at BP were probably the nicest of any resort we have stayed at in Punta Cana. The resort itself is a little older than some, so the trees and vegetation are much more lush. Our room was in building #25 which was excellently located in relation to the beach and lobby. The room itself was a suite which was very roomy and comfortable. We loved the spacious balcony where you could relax after a day at the beach.The staff at the BP was the friendliest we have experienced. Everyone greeted you with a smile and hola.We were able to eat at all the a la carte restaurants, and enjoyed all of them. The food was good and we felt that the service was exceptional. We ate twice at the evening buffet and always found a good selection to choose from. By the way, we did not experience any negative reactions from the food or water the entire week. We are not picky, so we ate salads, fresh fruit, and even ate the sushi at Sukaro.The weather was the best for any seven day stay. No rain and not a cloud the entire week. Of course this is imperative for a great vacation.We did run into people that had gotten ill. It seems hard to explain why some people get sick and others don't while eating basically the same food. People just need to be aware that they are in a different country and the food is going to be different from what they are used to. Moderation is key to enjoying your vacation.We would definitely return to the Bavaro Princess.

<Content>Great Place, Bad Food Everything was wonderful about the Bavaro Princess except the food. The hotel was nice and clean, the beach was beautiful. The staff was very friendly although they speak very little english. We stayed for 3 nights and 4 days and that was a perfect amount of time. There isn't a lot of night life so you might get bored after a little bit of time. I would recommend going on some of the excursions the hotel has to offer. The dolphin swim is fun and so is the marinarium party boat! My one word of advice is if you have a weak stomach DON'T EAT!!!!. After two days, I got horribly sick. With throwing up, diarheaa and the chills..I had to go to the medical clinic to get antibiotics and a shot. I was able to make it on the plane home but it took at least 5 days to feel better. I advise drinking only bottled water. Don't put any ice in the drinks. and stay away from fruit, salad and meat. Although my boyfriend didn't get sick at all. Other than the food..my experience was great..

<Content>trust the reviews...don't take a chance I just got home last night from the Bavaro Princess, a group of us went for a wedding. Most of our group have travelled to the Caribean many times, so please consider this when reading this review. This is a beautiful, very large property, immaculately kept. The trolley system was very efficient. The beach is also out of this world, you can go for long long walks. The ocean was somedays very rough, great if you were careful, not safe for little kids. Our rooms were in a less desirable part of the resort, right along the roadway. While they were conveniently located close to the lobby the rooms were not nearly as nice as others. The maid service was horrible. We had our room cleaned for only the first four days and then no one came in! By our last day we had one towel left!!! The one good thing about our room location was that there was a nice pool right behind our rooms with it's own bar....was very peaceful and great for kids. Pool could have been cleaner, was very slippery at waters edge. Potentially very dangerous. The market right outside the property was less than average. The resort had cheaper trinkets to buy.The worst part of this resort was indeed the food. THis is no joke, if you have not yet booked your trip my humble advice is to go to another island. About a quarter of our group were very ill. This seemed to be true for any group of people we met. On the trolley everyone was talking about who in their group was ill. I agree with other reviews when they say they don't know why this is because even those who were exceptionally careful got sick. No one needed to see the doctor but they lost 2-3 days of their trip. I noticed that food, mostly from the grill/McPrincess was not cooked properly. Burgers were raw as was the chicken. I don't think the food is kept hot enough. THe buffet at the beach (the indoor one) seemed better as some of the food was clearly cooked better. The drinks were good but we stayed away from the ice. I always asked for my grilled food to be well done.....no one seemed to understand this...or never paid attention.The staff were friendly enough. The shows were less than average. Same old resort fare. Very amateur in comparison to other shows we have seen in the Caribean. Overall, the beauty of this resort isn't quite enough to make up for the very poor food quality or the real risk of getting very sick. The risks are not worth the money. We met people on the plane on our way home who had similar reviews about other resorts in this area. Everyone we talked to knew someone who became ill in Punta Cana.....which is why I say go somewhere else. I would never go back to this resort. We also heard this morning that Malaria is back in this area, only another reason to go elsewhere.

<Content>Bavaro Princess Hotel - No No When we arrive at our room, the odor was horrible. It stinks like hell in the room. We asked for a new room. In this new room, it was impossible to stay on the balcony because there was a broken pipe beside and it smells bad again.During 3 days, we took cold shower even if we ask to fix it. One time, the front desk told me let the water running till I get hot water.....We tried to do reservations in their restaurants but there was no place available. The front desk told us that we have to reserve before 7h30 in the morning to have a chance to have an available table....One night, at the sea food restaurant, we ate a langoustine and 4-5 hours after, my daugthter and me were in an ambulance to go to the hospital..... We stayed there for almost 2 days.Don't go there please. You will regret it.

<Content>Go Platininum!! So my boyfriend (30)and I (22) just returned from a week stay at the Bavaro Princess, and had a great time!! Let me start by saying that this property is huge, so if you are looking for a small resort, this isn't the place for you. However if you book platinum, it has a small resort kind of feel. With the Platinum upgrade included are rooms adjacent to ocean or the platinum lounge(which is steps from the beach), private lounge with big sceen tv, better drinks, free internet, private check-in and check-out. Another good feature, you can book the entire weeks choice of a la cartes the day u get there! We had a huge selection being able to hop over to another princess resort with transportation included. We only went near the main lobby a handful of times. this made it feel like a small resort because you meet everybody else staying in platinum. by the end of our trip people thought we were travelling in a group, but all 18 of us from Winnipeg had just met!!We lucked out with one of the closest rooms to the ocean (756) and were very pleased. Two things we didn't like: this is a energy efficient resort which means to have any power you must first put your card key in this machine on the wall. What a hassle! Our fridge would turn off and our alarm clock never worked! Bring a travel size clock if u care what time you get up, wake-up call service was very sketchy! The guy is very rude and hangs up all the time in the middle of speaking!!The bathtub and shower could be updated. I don't take baths and wasn't about to start here. We had hot water most of the day(even peak hours) however no water pressure.The beach is out of this world! You can walk for miles! The sand is like powder and the ocean almost turquoise! Fairly wavy at times. watch your kids, and others sometimes!The food was good. I had my best meals at the a la carte restaurants. First night ate at the main lobby buffet, and was pleasently suprised. The selection is endless. I stuck with pasta most of the time. it was excellent. Licey $(free with platinum) we did not like. Great ambiance, but we didn't like the food. We found everything very rich and told our friends to get sauces on the side, which must of helped beacuse most of them enjoyed Licey. Heard the asparagus soup is excellent. El Gaucho (argentinean steak) We loved this place. caesar salad here is amazing!! steak was cooked properly but not the best cut of meat. the ice cream here was like a pineapple gelati and it was amazing!Sombrero(mexican, punta cana princess) This was our favorite! WE recommend going! The tram comes to the platinum lounge for pick-up and drops you right at the door. very conveninent! don't limit yourself to one choice, order a few you're all inclusive!!Il Bacio(Italian punta cana princess) This one was good. I had fettucinne with pesto sauce and it was excellent!Petite Fondue(Punta cana princess) We had the worst service ever here!! Everybody we talked to, loved this place so we were looking forward to it, however service was lacking. With transportation to and from the bavaro princess, they give you one hour 15 minutes . The came to get us and we had just started with our appetizer! After that they rushed us through everything that we didn't have time to enjoy it~Rio Grande(tex mex Punta cana princess) We didn't enjoy this place and do not recommend it. We ordered filet mignon, which was a leftover piece of meat bacon thrown on top and some kind of gravy also. caesar salad was ok, but was made with iceburg lettuce.We were up for breakfast a handful of times and enjoyed the omlettes,but also a huge selection. Lunch we ate mainly by the beach where they have a buffet and macprincess which is burgers and fries. We really liked the burgers. We were both sick our last night there, but came prepared. Most food doesn't sit that well, but that was our only night we were stuck to our room(or bathroom) If you are planning any excursions, we recommened booking your dinner for that evening later than usual. the Isla Seaona trip the said they would be back by 7pm, and were not back until 8pm. Some people were denied their reservations if they were 15 mins late.(Which is odd beacuse they are on their own dominican time)We rented a driver to take us around in an air conditioned van for half a day. We brought alot of school supplies, old toys, old clothes etc. for the children down there. We would pull over to the side of the road and distribute our things. One family gave us a tour of their home. It is soo poor there, i recommend hitting up a dollar store and cleaning out your kids closets! Very similar to the outback safari except we only payed 40$ per couple. We caught a few of the night shows. The only one we stayed to watch the whole thing was the magic show. The other ones looked like your childs bad dance recital!In conclusion we had a great time, and would recommend it. The positives definately out weigh all the negatives. The people out there are soo friendly considering how long of hours the work, and poor pay. Although it is not necessary, learn a little bit of spanish, they really appreciate it, not to mention a little tip every now and again! hi Andrea, Susan,Lisa, Kelly!!!

<Content>Loved the Resort, Its people and the climate!! While I have read many reviews, I have never written one before today!! We have been to many places, but never an All-Inclusive. I have to say I was alittle nervous after reading some reviews! But thank goodness we still went and didn't change our minds! The resort was absolutely beautiful! The grounds were perfect! The people that work there couldn't have been any more sincere and genuine!! Honestly....people need to understand that they Aren't in Kansas anymore. If you want American food, American everything, then vacation only in USA!! The resort was clean, the food was very good. Yes, we did have 1 bad meal in the Italian restaurant. We just hopped on the little tram to the buffet and had some wonderful Mexican food!! It all worked out. The drinks were great and always a smile with quick service!! They even remembered what we were drinking!! My hat goes off to all of them!! My husband wants to book there again next January....When you had a perfect week of weather, service and beauty, its hard not to want to go back. If you have booked a week there, just remember to go there with an open mind that you are in a different country!! They do things differently than we do, but isn't that why we leave our country to explore and enjoy the beauty of other cultures???????

<Content>Beware-Not What it Seems My husband and I travelled to Punta cana the week of Jan 13-20. We always travel with 2 of our friends.Not what we expected. We were in Punta Cana about 4 years ago and we thought we were upgrading.. I would not give this hotel more than 2.5 stars.About 2-3 days into our vacation we all ended up with severe cramps and diarrea? Not sure if it was the food or possibly the ice?? Lots of people sick not just us.. A couple of people were taken by ambulance to the hopital.JUST BEWARE

<Content>Beautiful Resort!!!!! I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from 1/15/07-1/20/07. I went with my husband 2 children ages 2 and 4. This resort is absolutely gorgeous. I am not going to get into each thing specifically however, I am going to tell you that the only thing I screwed up on is bringing my 2 year old. I do not recommend this. My husband and I had a great time the room was fantastic!! We did enjoy the platinum package. If I had to do it all over again, I definately would do the platinum again. We enjoyed our free massage, our own lounge (which was great in the morning for the continental breakfast) and the american beer was great (MGD). My husband loved El Presidente beer so he had many of those. Our room was 751. We were right across from the wedding chapel and 20 feet from the beach!! That was unreal!!! I do have to admit that I don't think there is a bad room in the resort.. I would have enjoyed my room no matter where it was. I had no problems with bugs, mold, water pressure, water temperature and the maids were great!!! As far as the food, I unfortunately did not get to enjoy any of the ala carte restaurants due to the 2 year old, but we did go to the el gaucho, el hispanoila sp... sorry, and the mac princess which my kids loved. The food was just fine!!! We didn't get sick at all!!! I don't know where these people stayed that left bad reviews because it couldn't have been in this beautiful place!!! We will definately go back, but not until the baby is older... lol. Don't hesitate to book here and if you already did you are going to have a trip of a life time... Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions at all. millieann21@aol.com

<Content>Beauty and the Beast Beauty: We stayed at the BP Jan 7-14. This was our 4th time visiting the Bavaro area. As everyone has said, it is beautiful, its hard to top that stretch of beach. We went with the Platinum upgrade, which as nice. It makes checking in and out a breeze. If you if you want upgraded beer from the lounge, you have to ask before they would take you to a back room full of coolers. We didn't figure this out until the 2nd day. Never did understand why they were hiding it, since the only guests in the lounge are Platinum guests.The food was typical of all inclusives.The service varied from great to awful. There are a lot of rude people out there in the world, I won't comment from where. Don't let them bother you. Killing them with kindness seemed to upset them even more. Again, very typical.Beast: On our fourth day, I became very ill. I felt like something was inside my tummy ripping it apart. It lasted for 10 days. I couldn't keep any food in me. I attributed it to the food at the hotel, however after reading a previous post I had another thought. We also did the Outback Safari, which takes you to a ranch for lunch, and then to another ranch to sample a lot of Dominican Food. The reps. ensured us that the food was safe, but I wonder if there could be a link between the two. I did keep a positive attitude, I would rather be sick in paradise than at home and another plus was that this is the first vacation I came back minus a few pounds. :)All in all it was just okay. We won't repeat this hotel because of the size. If you are already booked, rest at ease. You will have a great time. Every experience is a memory made. We had a group of 12, we made a lot of memories. Most of mine were in the restroom :( If you have any questions feel free to e-mail me. bajabex@sbcglobal.net

<Content>Beautiful, relaxing but stomach problems!!! Our group of 12stayed at Bararo Princess Jan 13-20, 2007. It was a beautiful resort, well kept but old. The grounds were outstanding. the beach was wonderful, our rooms were old but for the most part clean but not 5 star.Six of us had stayed two years ago in a lower rated smaller resort and we did not get sick from the food. This time 7 out of the 12 had stomach problems, and 4 were very sick. Two of the group know that they were served bad scallups at the pay extra restaurant Licey. They spit them out they tasted so bad and were very ill that night, and a week later still do not feel great! So be really careful!!!!!!!!!!I myself did not have a problem. I found plenty to eat that I enjoyed.The main buffet in the lobby had many chioces and we all seemed to like it. For dinner we ate in all the different restaurants and the food was good, the service was slow but they all had a smile and tryed to please you. Except for El Pescador the service was terrible! We waited over two hours for our first course. The staff did not care, smile or try at all. The only one who was even friendly was the waiter for the drinks and it took him four times to get the order right but we did not mind becase he tried.All in all I had a great, relaxing vacation but I am not so sure my friends who got sick would say the same.

<Content>BEWARE, not sure of the problem. This place is extremely beautiful. The water, the pools, the beach is terrific. However the rooms look clean but they aren't. There are cockroaches in the rooms that come out of the drains. The rooms smell so bad. The poor cleaning people do not have mops but they use a towel wrapped on a stick and I did not smell disinfect or cleaning supplies at all. The cleaning people and waiters were very nice. The food has alot to be desired. It was mostly warm not hot food. For some reason 17 out of 18 out of our group became violently sick with vomiting and nauseau. It last approx two days where you felt like you were dying. It was bad. People around us also were saying they were sick also. Two even went in the ambulance, which before the hospital would help them wanted up front eight hundred American Dollars. We still do not know if it was food poisoning or a bacterial infection because of the improper cleaning or what. What I do know is we wll will never go back there. The Outback Safari was terrific and fun however the deep sea fishing was horrific. A rotten wooden boat with broken seats and no fishing. BEWARE. I just hope other people fare out better than we did.

<Author>GEMINI_DRAGON
<Content>Not even close to 5* rating !!! I booked my trip to Dominican Republic through applevacations.com. For starters, I got my papers 3 days late, even though they sent it through FedEx.The flight from SFO to Atlanta was ok, then i connected there to Punta Cana. That was also ok. Let me start with the rating applevacations.com gave this hotel. It's not accurate at all. At the most, i'd give it 3.5 stars. The property is old, the mattreses in my suite were covered in G-d knows what. The mini fridge had a broken freezer. Barely wam water in the shower. And those monstrous cockroaches !!! i have never seen that big of a cockroach. It flew too. Now the stuff speaks minimum English, when u tell them to fix a broken hairdryer, their 5 minutes, sir turned into 2-3 days. One of the floor manager by the name Armando is a liar !!! When we booked on of those dinners at the 5 of the restaurants on site, the stuff at Chopin spoke no English at all. They showed us a wine list and we thought it was all included. At the end of our dinner they brought us a piece of paper, saying that we owe 53$+26% tax for the bottle of wine. I had a huge argument at the check-out day with that Armando guy. When i called applevacations.com to resolve that issue for me, he lied to them, saying that stuff speaks perfect English. So on that sour note, i say this place is a big No-No !!!

<Content>great weather, not so great resort Me and my husband and 4 year old son just returned yesterday (Jan.23/07) from a one week stay at the Bavaro princess.First of all let me say that the property at this resort is beautiful.A very very large resort for those who enjoy that, most of the time you have to take a tram which came quite frequently. We were booked into a junior suite which was very outdated, small, noisy and very far from the beach and main pool, we upgraded to a suite 3 days into our trip for ten dollars per person a night, which was well worth it. Talked to alot of people who were extremely dissapointed with the junior suites, my honest advice is to upgrade if possible. Now I will comment on the food, again I too read the comments on this site before leaving and I thought alot of it was an exageration but unfortunately I now have to agree that this resort is not all that's it's cracked up to be.As far as the food, please be careful not to be too adventerous as my husband became very ill 3 days into our trip from somethiing he ate. I talked to quite a few other people with the same problem, in fact one party of 17 all had food poisining! Thankfully my son who is an extremely picky eater was fine.Be careful as to where you get your buns,breads etc.. fom because we witnessed a black bird pecking peices out of the breads , I actually informed a few people who were approaching this area to get bread not to eat it.The service fom the wait staff was quite slow as well,definately brush up on your spanish before leaving.To sum up our trip we were dissapointed and unfortunately have to say we would not return, but like every other comment on this site you pretty much have to go and judge for yourself. we did come back nicely tanned.

<Content>A true princess My husband and I and 10 friends just returned Jan 20th from a great week at the BP. Our suite was beautiful, our maid Maria did a great job, and we had friendly service from almost all the bartenders. We found service in the restaurants a little slow but have no problem serving ourselves. Have been to Cuba and Mayan Riv and the BP'S grounds were by far the nicest. We were in suites near the quiet pool (sorry to anyone we disturbed because we weren't quiet) and felt we had a great location - 500's -close to main lobby and tram station. The main lobby was really beautiful and a great place to hang out in the evening. The beach was awesome - would be nice if people would pick up after them selves though (plastic glasses and butts) and the towel game is really annoying but we always managed to find 12 loungers to pull together. The para sailing was a great experience! 10 of us required immodium at least one day but it was really just an inconvenience - we still carried on and had a great time. Highly advise making a reservation at Chopin if for nothing more than its beauty, and we all enjoyed our supper at El Gaucho. Otherwise found it easier just to eat at the buffet. As usual I was nervous due to negative reviews but as always have only encountered petty peeves not worth mentioning! The weather was perfect despite a scary looking forecast of rain everyday which if it happened was extremely brief and not worth leaving your beach chair for. Went to both beach markets and some of the stores in town but really don't enjoy the bartering. Feel free to email if you have any questions - sandyairit42@hotmail.com.

<Content>Did I stay at the same resort as these bad reviews? I can't believe all of the bad reviews for this resort. It was a fabulous place and I would go back again.We travelled with a group of 14 people (in our 30's and 40's) from 1/10-1/19. We spent a lot of time between the beach and the pool. Both were very nice. The beach is very clean and we could always find chairs. There is a bar and restaurant right off the beach, so you have easy access to everything. The pool is just off from the beach, so if your group splits up, it is easy to meet for lunch.The people were great. The Dominicans are very nice. Ruben the poolside bartender is great and always made sure our cups were full.We did an excursion to Saona island. I highly recommend it. The bus ride is long and bumpy, but you really get to see how Dominicans live and learn to appreciate what we have. You then take a catamaran ride over to the island. This is a lot of fun. The freely serve you rum and Coke or cervezas. You can either relax on the boat to the tunes of Bob Marley or you can merinque with group. At the island, you are served lunch and you can hang out in the Caribbean or dance with the locals for about 2 1/2 hours. Then you board speed boats and stop half way back to wade in the water in a starfish area. It was really a great trip.Food - The food is not gourmet, but I am amazed that people complain that it is horrible. The buffets and the a la carte restaurants all have plenty to offer and if you can't find something you like, then you are way too picky to be traveling to a country like the Dominican. The buffets do a good job of trying to offer something for all of their visits. Plenty of breads, meats, cheeses and an egg bar where they make great fresh omelets. The steaks at El Gaucho are quite good and Sakura was our favorite with great Chicken with Cashews.The nightlife is not the greatest. the shows are kind of cheesy, but we enjoyed hanging out and having cocktails. We were to spent from our days of cocktails at the beach to ever make it to a disco, but we heard they were fun.If you are looking for a nice resort with nice people for a good price, then this is a great place. If I were to complain about anything, it would be some of the rude people that stayed at the resort, definitely not the people that worked there. We did not do platinum and had no issues with checking in, getting our luggage or any other issues.Finally, as far as getting sick. We had some people in the group that got diarrhea and 2 that were a little more sick. However, most of us did fine. Be sensible. Do not lay in the sun and drink heavily all day without drinking some water and taking care of yourself. And, if you question what you are eating, stop! Eat what you know if safe. Although we all try to stay away from them, those that ate mostly fried foods, did very well.If you want to have fun, I recommend Bavaro Princess.

<Content>This resort has improved in recent years. We were at the Bavaro Princess in Jan. 2005 for one week and felt that that wasn't enough so returned January 2 - 16, 2007. Two weeks is too much, however, and 10 days would have been perfect. Sadly, that's not offered in any packages we've seen. There is a new spa now that would rival any city spa and the VIP package has been replaced by the Platinum Club with a lounge built over part of what used to be a pond with a fountain. In other reviews, people have said that the Platinum Club must be booked through your agent, and it is standard with Air Canada, but it is also possible to go with cheaper tour operators and buy the package on arrival. The Platinum Club service is worthwhile. The lounge is a great place to hang out, with two computers and unlimited internet access. Most people just log on, check their e-mail, and get off, so it was never a long wait for a computer. This time we did find that the staff seemed to be getting a tad lackadaisical, not as eager to please as last time. I agree with another reviewer that the service in El Pescador (seafood restaurant) was very bad. The lunch buffet at the Hispaniola (in the lobby) is far superior to the beach buffet, but if you're on the beach it's handy and you don't have to get dressed. A reviewer commented that there is only one pool but that's not true. There is a smaller pool near the hotel/lobby. It's quite private and near the spa. A petty annoyance, we were charged $2 for the use of the phone in our room. (We had tried to call friends in another room but there was no answer.) In general, over the last two years, I would have to say that the resort facilities have improved, but the service is less friendly.

<Content>Never go back! I agree with the last reviewer, this hotel is at best two-stars. The food in the buffet's was greasy and tasted like from the school cafeteria. The front desk was totally clueless and unhelpful to us. They have a lot of learning to do when dealing with customers. There are way too many other places to go to in the Carib to have to deal with rude hotel staff. The rooms seemed dark and sparse.

<Content>Great resort...If you don't need to eat! My boyfriend and I booked the platinum package at the Bavaro Princess during the week of Nov 19th/06 thru Nov 26th/06. We did a lot of research and read many reviews (the majority of which were on this website) prior to our departure. The beach was amazing, nice white sand!! The ocean water was warm and we spent a lot of time tanning on the beach. Every morning we went and had breakfast at the beachside buffet. The buffet in the main lobby was available as well, but we loved being by the water.The grounds are amazing! There are lots of palm trees and the maintenance staff did an amazing job tending to the grounds of this resort daily. The mini zoo at this huge resort is a nice added feature too. We were happy to find the rooms for platinum guests were very close to the beach. The maids cleaned them daily, however sometimes they were later than expected. In those situations we would just go to the platinum lounge and ask to have somebody clean our room. The maid did a fantastic job. We left them money, gum and suckers as a daily tip.The rooms had free liquor dispensers stocked with vodka, rye and rum. Since the platinum lounge was literally right out our door, we took a lot of our booze from them. They carry Budweiser beer and premium liquor which is an added bonus for platinum package guests. We tipped them at the lounge regularly and any time they served us drinks. Platinum guests have access to 3 other resorts as well. You can book a variety of a la carte dinners at the Bavaro Princess and other various resorts through the platinum lounge. They arrange your transportation at night for the dinners between resorts. You can also take advantage of the beaches and bars at the 3 affiliated resorts as well! We frequently walked down to the Punta Cana Princess to lay on the loungers they have. Only platinum club guests were able to use this area which included HUGE white double mattresses with a white drape to provide some shade from the sun. We also had a massage that was included in our platinum package鈥EFINITELY a nice added bonus!It was unfortunate that my boyfriend was extremely ill on Wednesday night (half way through our vacation). He was violently ill running a high temperature and throwing up constantly. I was scared, but the thing that helped him the most was drinking bottled water so he would not dehydrate. I went over to the platinum lounge to see if anyone had gravol or any other drugs to give him. I met a great couple from Sault Ste Marie. They went back to their room and returned with some gravol for my boyfriend. Even though he could not keep that down, it was worth a shot! The next day he was feeling better but did not want to eat anything besides bread. Later in the day he got his appetite back and celebrated that fact with a few drinks as well. Thursday we took it easy by the pool. Later the same evening we went to a great restaurant called EL GOUCHO at the Punta Cana Princess. This was the only meal we really enjoyed. Friday we did some parasailing, which was amazing!! Alas, Friday night my boyfriend was ill again, throwing up all hours of the night. My stomach throughout our trip was on and off. The smell of the buffet located by the water wasn鈥檛 very appealing either. Lucky for us the room service was included with the platinum package. I did not trust the buffet or many of the a la carte restaurants, so we lived off spaghetti and pizza offered in our room service menu for the remainder of our trip. We made the best of our vacation irregardless, but we could not wait to come home. To top it all off I ended up with sun poisoning. We understand that Dominican food is different, but this was my 3rd time to the Dominican Republic and it was the only time I have ever felt this sick. If eating was not a huge factor in life this resort would be a 5 star! Others that traveled with Air Canada Vacations had similar stories. At least one person in every group was sick for a day or two.As I said, the grounds were amazing and the beach was beautiful! If you go to this resort be cautious of what you eat. We will not be returning! Our travels are going to take us elsewhere!

<Content>Platinum Upgrade worth it! We booked our vacation through Air Canada Vacations and got a fabulous 2 for 1 deal with the Platinum upgrade package. If you're flying from Canada, Air Canada is the way to go. They use their regular planes, with lots of leg room. Not like Air Transat or SkyService that try and squeeze in as many people as they can on their planes. It also makes a difference in the service you get in DR if you book with AirCanada. Plus you get to collect the air miles if you have a rewards card!The Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort is located on a beautiful beach, the water is clean (very little bits of seaweed in the water or on the beach). We had the platinum upgrade and I would highly recommend that you get this package as it really made the trip special (as far as I know, it's only offered through Air Canada vacations). Benefits include the best rooms near the beach (ours was second floor, ocean-view), premium liquors, 2 free massages, 2 free snorkelling trips, 1 dive, extra maid service, dinner at Licey's, etc, etc. Well worth it.The rooms are uniquely designed and very comfortable. Be prepared to wait for hot water. There are certain times during the day when none is available, usually between 10 AM to 5 PM. But as long as you shower after 5, you're ok and there's plenty of it. The resort has a protrected mangrove - nice to walk through it -- you'll see some caged birds and reptiles when you do. There are peacocks, swans, ducks all around the property and a welcome sight to see when you go for breakfast. Several times we were met by a male peacock in full plummage. Keep in mind that a mangrove is basically a swamp and the water is stagnant so it does get a little stinky, especially at night. If you don't get the platinum upgrade and just go for a regular room, make sure you don't get a room near the Mangrove for this reason only. Food was as expected. Don't expect gourmet, you won't get it. You eat to live, not live to eat, when you're at all-inclusive resort, so as long as you go in with that attitude, you won't be disappointed. We ate at two of the a la carte restaurants (Licey's and Bella Pasta), again, nothing special (especially if you're used to really good restaurants), but edible. Breakfast we ate at the Hispaniola buffet near the lobby and lunch was at the Gaucho buffet by the beach. There's also a McPrincess Burgers that's open longer hours during the day for burges and hot dogs, if you get hungry between meal-times.My husband and I are both gym enthusiasts so we spent every morning working out. Gym is a little better than what you get at other resorts. Two treadmills, two ellipticals, two bikes, free weights and numerous weight machines. Not too bad, considering. Unfortunately, one of the treadmills broke down after the 4th day and as you can imagine, turnaround for service calls aren't as quick as what we are used to in North America so it still hadn't been fixed when you left 3 days later.This is our second time to Punta Cana and I have to say I much preferred it to our first trip (we stayed at the Catalonia Bavaro that time - hated it!). We will definitely go back to Punta Cana but probably would go in February instead of January so the weather is a little warmer then.

<Content>Good resort!! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess in Sept/06. We thought this resort was very good. We had the platinum package and we thought it was worth it. The price isn't that bad if you book it with your agent. It apparently is much more expensive if yu book it once you get there. We really liked the free room service for breakfast, as we are late sleepers and we dont have to rush to get to the restaurant before 10am. These rooms are also close to the beach which is a bonus considering the size of the resort. I thought the rooms were great! They were big, they had a fridge, and liquor dispensers, large bathrooms/sink area. The maids were great ( even better when you give them a bigger tip )The restaurants were ok. You cant really expect much from an all-inclusive resort when it comes to food. Licey - the restaurant that is included with the platinum upgrade - was fabulous. We had caviar and steak and seafood and they treated you like royalty.The seafood restaurant was the only bad restaurant. The service is terrible and the food made both of us sick. We had an appetizer and then we both had lobster and were there for an hour and a half. The waiters ignored us, and everyone else there. Im not sure what everyone at this reataurant is lazy. Maybe they put all of the slackers at this reataurant!The main pool was great, and yes the music is loud but who cares. The beach was beautiful and you can take a walk to the other resorts and drink over there if you are platinum. And yes, they will check your bracelet to make sure that you are a platinum guest.The staff were great, always going out of their way to make sure you had everything you needed. If you found a staff member whose english wasnt that good, just find another one whose english is better. No big deal. I tried to book a spa appointment and the girl couldnt speak any english, so I found another staff member who spoke english and spanish and they called and booked my pedicure for me. The staff at the casino were unbelievably rude. I think they are told to act like this. Im not quite sure why. I guess management wants them to keeep their distance from guests to avoid them getting any 'extras'.Going shopping is a little strange if you're not use to the harassment. But we have experiences this at other resorts and know how to deal with these people. I know it can be scary but they are harmless, they are just trying to make a living. If you want anything like cigars, cigarettes, souvenirs. Buy it from these guys - NOT the gift shop on the resort. You will get it for a fraction of the price.No vacation is ever perfect - So juts try to relax and have a good time!

<Content>I thought this place was great!!!! A group of ten of us (5 couples age 25-30) went here on Jan 5th till the 12th and had a fabulous time. The food isn't all that great but Im not on vacation to expect lavish food. The staff was very friendly and helpful. All you have to do is tip them a buck here and there and they're happy. Our room had a leaky ceiling the first day by the a/c and they were there w/in a couple hours and fixed it. On day 3 our door broke and they fixed that promptly as well. The grounds are very clean and mainained. The staff provides activities on and around the beach including dancing, aerobics, and water polo. We went on the banana boat one day...a lot scarier than it looks. We also went on a marinarium tour and went snorkling with nurse sharks and stingrays...it was fabulous! Kinda like a booze cruise. We also went on the outback safari which I would also recommend. We went through apple vacations and they we're very helpful. I would definately recommend going with the PLATINUM package. It was an extra $200 a person...but that includeds one free dinner at the fancy restarant (food wasn't that great but), 2 free 20 min massages..which seemed like 30, free cigars, a room close to the beach, and most importatnly topshelf booze..which helped prevent a hangover..I drank stolli most of the week. Also the banana royales were great as well! I would definately go back and do recommend this resort. Warning..there are a lot of french travelers there..and the stigma is true..they are very rude people!!! Otherwise eveyong else there was great and nice :)

<Content>Anniversary vacation ruined! 1. Mylene was best Air Canada vacation representative we have ever had - very knowledgeable and helpful.2. Grounds and beach beautiful, Doctor on call nice, cleaning staff good and nice.3. Food generally dangerous - not being maintained at proper temperatures - this from my wife Ilene who is a professional dietitian. We both had food poisoning, despite being super careful! This ruined the last 3 days of our stay.(We hardly drank alcohol and would have enjoyed an occasional glass of wine had the wine been decent - but wine offered was terrible.)4. Room ok, but not deluxe - bathroom horrible - no water pressure for shower, old crusty shower spout, tub didn't drain properly - chipped, stained, would not take a bath - had to call 3 times to get draining issue fixed - first 2 fixes didn't work - disappointing.5. Service so-so, despite generous tipping for everything we asked for.6. Platinum guest baggage delivered almost 3 hours after quick check in - unacceptable.7. Very few hotel employees understand almost any English at all - could be an issue in case of medical emergency.8. You are misrepresenting this resort as a 5 star resort - it is not a 5 star at all. Perhaps, a 3 star at best - please check out trip advisor.comIlene + Brian

<Content>Be careful! We brought a large group to this resort and found it to be overbooked as described by the front desk. Our travel agent booked my wife and I a king size bed but we were offered two twin size beds by the representative at the front desk. I was second in line to check in and had to wait with 25-35 people behind me for 45 minutes until the language challenged person at the front desk took care of the two couples in front of me. Due to the fact that the resort was SEVERELY OVERBOOKED, we waited in line wherever we went whether it was for the buffet breakfast or drink line or even the information line at the front desk. The bathrooms leaked in most of the rooms and the floors were flooded when we checked in. A quick response was delivered to the room in 48 hours to fix the leaky fixtures in the TOILET of all places. Imagine just might have been leaking into the room? Made several complaints to the General Manager who took care of most of the issues by the end of our stay and offered a special dinner for us the lat night. Maybe this week was just a tough one to be there. Moral of story; Book a high end resort when traveling to Punta Cana and avoid this place at all costs until they get some help. Customer Service rating was a 3 on a scale of 10.........Massachusetts.. 12/30/06 to 1/6/07

<Content>Very large resort We spent the holidays at this resort our vacation started on the 19th of Dec and continued to the 2 of January. It's our 4th time to Punta Cana and we'ed all agreee that it was an okay experience. We travelled in a group of 6 including 3 children. For me the resort was too big with so much time being spent travelling to and from breakfast, the beach and the pool. For my children the pool was the largest disappointment. It was dirty, and although we saw pool boys cleaning each morning with the amount of people at this resort it should have been done at least three times a day. The children were content with the kids club and actually particpated in most of the events. Bella did a wonderful job including the children, especially in the lion king show. The evening entertainment was enteraining!! Our vacation last year was at the LTI just up the beach and for us we would all go back there in a flash, the food was nothing to get excited about, however the bar b que chicken and fries were to die for. I believe it all depends on what your expectations are. I want a safe beach, no roaches, and no illness. There is only so much a resort can do to make your trip enjoyable, you have to make it what it is. Your travel companions, realistic expectaions, and the desire to have a great vacation. In regards to the staff, just like at home if you treat them with respect, and attempt to communicate with them they will do anything in their power to help you. I speak limited Spanish and my husband who is Portuguese helps out, and our children who speak French all made an effort to communicate. I believe in tipping and we had no problems with the bar, the restaurants, or the front desk, and Freddy who books your reservations for the Al la Carte was just amazing. Over all I would be honest when giving a reference for this hotel, for us it is to big, the pool could have been a lot cleaner but the staff are great ,there were no BUGS in our rooms, and the food was what it is. Travelling at this time of the year would not be my first choice again, it's still winter so the days are shorter, it was very windy, and it rained at least once a day during our two week period. No fault of the resort though.For families that like everything close at hand, clean, and regular staff who basically become your individual host then I recommend the LTI. Where ever you may end up on your vacation just remember it is a vacation sit back relax and enjoy.

<Content>Do Not Stay Here!!! We had a group of twelve people (eight adults, four children) and not one of us was satisfied with the resort. Although the beaches and pool where very nice the rooms, food and service where terrible.The Rooms: Our group had four rooms. Three of the four rooms smelled like mold. We had to demand a new room for one of the families in our group due to ants in the bed. The water pressure in the showers was very bad and the hot water was luke-warm at best. The Food: The resort has a reservation system for all the restraunts except one buffet. Of the seven nights we where there we had to eat at the buffet all but two due to the lack of open tables at the other restraunts. To make reservations you must be at the front lobby at 8:00 am the day before you want the reservation (I don't know about you but I enjoy sleeping in on vacation). We did not have any meals at this resort that would be anywhere near five star. Most of the time we ate the fresh fruit and noodles from the pasta bars. The Service: The best way to sum up the service at the Bavaro Princess is that the staff just does not care. At meals it was hard to get served drinks. At most meals there was not enough silverware on the tables. Of the two times that we did have reservations they messed one of them up (they tried to make us eat at 10:00 pm instead of 8:00 pm). They charged $24 US for a two minute local phone call from the room. When we complained about the smell in the rooms they did nothing about it. There where times of the day when you could not get anything to eat. The bars and restraunts hours where not convienent. The entertainment was not very good. The only pool was closed from 7:00 pm until 8:00 am for chemical treatment. The public restrooms where not clean.Overall the best advice I can give you on the Bavaro Princess is DO NOT STAY HERE!!!

<Content>Beautiful beach Jan. 9, 2007My family and I wanted to treat ourselves to a Christmas trip so we researched Punta Cana as much as possible. It was a choice between the Princess Bavaro and another - Grande Bahia Principe. We had heard great things about both. In the end, we picked the Princess. We went from Dec. 16 -23.We have been to many other resorts and always go for the 5 star variety. We were leary of the comments on the food. We read so many reviews, but everyone has their own level of expectation and they varied too much.We knew that we would be very picky as Canadians, we have come to expect a certain standard. Although the resort offered several restaurants and buffets, we were disappointed with the food overall. There was a tremendous selection at the main buffet and eventually we found items we could live with, many dishes were unrecognizable and tasted weird. the bread selection was great and tasted good, so did the French fries, burgers are not the greatest but okay.The resort itself was lovely, our rooms were clean and the marble bathrooms were impressive. On closer inspection, our bath drain worked poorly and we had a small leak in the corner that the maid would address each day by leaving a towel rolled up in the corner.I would greatly advise buying the upgrade to the Platinum pkg. This allowed us our own check in/out service, computer access and premium brand drinks wherever we went. We had our own lounge area that we could access drinks and some pastries, buns, cold breakfast, coffee and tea. It was great. There was also a large screen TV that showed American movies so you could sit in there if you wanted to. We were also able to check out of our rooms and then come back and use a shower before our late night flight home.The beach is gorgeous, no worries of stepping on something in the water -it is absolutely clear with no debris (except for a bit of seaweed that would roll in at times with the waves)Boogie boarding is great, the waves were not too high, but enough to give you a good ride. the pool was okay. Grounds were spotless and well looked after. We left a dollar or two every morning for the maid along with some small treats such as crayons/books, Christmas books, candies etc.As careful as we were not to drink the tap water or over-induldge, we all ended up with Turista, meaning we were scrambling to the bathrooms a few times a day. It was annoying but not enough to ruin the vacation. Make sure to bring as much Immodium etc. as you can.Entertainment: each evening was not great, sometimes downright hokey. The best night was the disco beach party. There was a disco at the entrance by the casino but we never made it as we were too tired by eleven o'clock and most of the discos didn't open until midnight. Our 22 year old complained that the entertainment wasn't great, but he ended up going to bed before midnight because the days were so hot and long.Although we have been critical of the food, we realize that our standards are very high, so do not go expecting to get the same quality you are used to at home. On the other hand, for us, food makes the holiday, so although we gave it an above average rating because the place really was nice, I doubt we'd go back.

<Content>Fantastic Resort, but stay away from time share !!! My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our week in Princess Bavarro. *Food was quite good, varied, and of course all drinks (including champagne, cocktails, etc) were served for free*Service was friendly, diligent, and rather efficient, *We were VERY much impressed by the performance of the entertainment team. Congratulations, guys !*The room was large, well decorated, with a nice little terrace opened on lush vegetation, *Beach was large, clean, white sanded, with turquoise waters. *Swimming pool was large and surrounded by vegetation*Crowd: mostly couples/honeymooners/families, all ages, not that many singles*The ambiance was romantic, peaceful, friendlyOverall, a fantastic place that I'd recommend strongly.BUT WHY ON EARTH DO THEY SPOIL THE WHOLE THING BY ASOCIATING WITH 鈥淩OYAL VACATIONS鈥?AND THEIR TIME SHARE SCAM?????While passing through the lobby, occasionally someone will invite you to go to some kind of a showroom where supposedly they will tell you how to come back to Princess Bavaro next time without passing through a tour operator鈥?(and hence saving your money). I've done the experience with my girlfriend, and what we saw was shocking.They will put you with a salesperson whose only objective is to have you sign a paper and get your cash. This person will endeavor to lie bluntly, deceive you, and you鈥檙e your signature and your credit card number. He鈥檒l invite you to drink liquor and promise you the world: unlimited vacations, the lowest prices, full flexibility to book in any resort in the world, 鈥渘o hidden charges鈥? VIP treatment. Ask for it, you got it.The truth is that all this is BS.-they will forget to mention the tremendous booking constraints 鈥?when you book online or with your travel agent, you are free to go anywhere, not anymore if you sign with Royal vacations -that their catalog includes less than 200 resorts 鈥?on a worldwide basis, that鈥檚 little-the notion of 鈥渃redits鈥?(you get a certain number of credits per year, for example if you pay 10,000 euro you might get about 10,000 credit; and each resort in their catalog has to be paid with more or less credits depending on the standing and the season); -that a 10,000 euro 鈥渋nvestment鈥?doesn鈥檛 even give you enough credit to book at a week per year at princess Bavaro during December鈥?of course, on top of the credits, you鈥檇 have to pay 1200 Euro plus plane tickets, --for a couple to stay there); -that those reservations come with expensive plane tickets that you鈥檒l have to pay for 鈥?check out the price of a plane ticket to punta cana-that you鈥檒l have to pay management charges, maintenance fees, processing fees, etc; Try to ask for the contract. You鈥檒l have a hard time! They might even kick you out. I managed to see it after 2 hours of discussion, pretending that I was interested and ready to sign. Funny: one of the first things this contract mentions is that whatever they told you orally is not part of the deal! In case some people might give credit to the salesperson pitch鈥?br/>Also, they wont mention either the sophisticated way they set up their business with shell companies in tax paradises, and scam friendly jurisdictions (Dominican republic, spain, etc.), the army of lawyers that work for them to cover clients receivables (from those clients who don鈥檛 want or cannot pay). Actually they鈥檒l tell you these lawyers work for you!!And of course, they will hide that once you sign (under Dominican law), you CANNOT go backwards, and you鈥檙e set up for 30 years !Really, as a business person with some investment and law savvy, I was smiling at the scam and thinking 鈥渉ow can one possibly fall into that?鈥?But then entered a young couple. They had signed the contract one week before. They had trusted the guy in front of them. He had promised the company would charge much later but the company in fact had liberally paid itself as soon as they had gotten the credit card number. The couple鈥檚 account was negative; they were in deep financial trouble. The lady was crying and going to each of us in the room, urging us not to sign.They were not the only ones we met that fell in the trap. This is why I decided to write this post. Princess Bavaro is a great resort, but stay away from Royal Vacations. THEIR DEAL IS A ROTTEN DEAL !And to the management of the resort: Amigos, please clean your back yard, that wont give you good reputation.

<Content>READ THIS...if you want an honest review of the resort.. My friends and I (18, 23, 27) left for the Dominican Dec 19-26. We booked through Air Canada Vacations and received the Platinium Package. Keep in mind, that although I am young (23) I am an experienced traveller who has been to the Dominican 5 plus times, even twice a year!! I find that those who are new tend to give higher ratings as they have really no comparison. So if you are uneasy about whether to book with this resort or not than this review is for you.I will only discuss the main points..the good, the bad, the ugly...ok so here we go...The resort is beautiful, large and well maintained, but no comparison to the Bahia Principe (so if you are deciding between the two, than go with the Bahia). Here I begin my rant, BUT KEEP IN MIND ...I am not an anal person, very easy going and very easy to make happy. Our water pressure was tragic..it was more like a dribble and there was not any hot water...my first shower there was FREEZING...we called to get it fixed, they came shortly, it seemed to be fixed, but no cigar amigo! We called him the next day, same thing, temporarily fixed, but no hot water. Finally we decided to let the water run for about an hour, than VOILA! The water pressure began to get stronger and the water warmer. We decided since it was half way through our vacation that we didn't want to switch rooms. The food was terrible!!!!!!!!! Never have I been to a resort with such disappointing food. Every resort I have been to has been good to excellent, even the buffets. We all had stomach problems as well. MY FIRST TIME HAVING THIS PROBLEM! The a la cartes were terrible, the service was extremely slow, I understand that we are on Dominican time, but honestly I almost fell asleep. So, I really cannot recommend a restaurant for you because they were all bad. I am not a picky eater, but I honestly thought to myself, do these chefs taste the food that they are making? We were there for the Christmas Eve Dinner, and the set up and decorations were BEAUTIFUL. They did an excellent job, but too bad it didn't taste as good as it looked!The entertainment was really cheesy lip synching, but the dancers do put in a lot of effort. That's all I can say about that. If you are looking for a nightlife than this resort is not the place to be. You have to venture out to Club Mangu, which is about a 5 minute cab ride, should cost you about a dollar a person. We always went with a large group and that's what it came out to. The music is decent and when you are loaded than everything is amazing!Of course, the beach was beautiful. I can't deny that.The only positive thing about the platinum package was that we were close to the beach and the platinum lounge bartender was really awesome. It was dead in there, but we always went there to pre drink before we headed out. Platinum members do receive better alcohol (the only other bonus). You also receive a free 20 minute massage which was pretty good and also free water excursion, but we did not use that voucher.Believe me, book somewhere else!! That's the honest truth :)

<Content>would not recommend this place We just returned from a week at the Princess Bavaro and very disappointing. Nowhere near a 5 star hotel. The accommodation provided through Sunwing tours was sub standard and not clearly described. There are 3 levels of accommodation/service and the top being Platinum, one might have a better experience if you are able to book this level. This is a HUGE property and a beautiful one at that , however, the staff were clearly unable to handle the numbers of guests. We found that if you were fluent Spanish you also had a better chance of better, quicker service. We had a medical emergency in our group, and fortunately it was only a perforated eardrum and the response to our request for assistance was very upsetting. Had it been anything more serious and you couldn't speak Spanish, it could be very serious consequences. Yes it is a different country and reference is continuously made to DR time , they are still charging top prices for substandard service. The buffets were adequate but the individual restaurants, Sakura, Pescadora, Chopin, were awful....when we asked for assistance at the Casino the dealer rolled her eyes at us because we weren't able to communicate in Spanish. Clearly not customer focused for all guests.....The beach is beautiful, but it was very crowded and the water was very rough. very windy at this time of year.....however no one makes this clear before you travel..We have been to all but 5 islands in the Carribbean and this experience has been the most disappointing......

<Content>Tips from a platinum visitor I have a hard time grasping many of the negative reviews I鈥檓 reading鈥?From speaking to many people who have visited this hotel, all have seemed enchanted by it. Also ironic is that non-platinum visitors appear to have more to criticize about this hotel (but most agree they wouldn鈥檛 upgrade), while platinum visitors have mostly good things to say鈥?Just a thought鈥?My boyfriend and I visited the Bavaro princess in the week of Dec 17-24. In short, we loved this place and have very little criticism to report from this resort. We took the Platinum package and while we have no way of knowing what those without the package felt about this resort, we did feel like the personal touches (e.g. personal concierge, robes and slippers, free massage, internet, diving, snorkelling, room service) were wonderful and made us feel like royalty. Thus, we definitely recommend the upgrade. And bear this in mind when reading this review. Hotel:The hotel appeared to be divided in 3 zones, the junior suites which is a regular hotel complex situated close to the lobby and away from the beach, then you have the regular suites divided into beautiful little bungalows housing 8 'villas' (4 on 2nd floor and 4 on bottom), each with their own large terrace. Then you have the platinum suites which are the same as the regular suites, but are closer to the beach and pool and are closer to the platinum lounge where you have your own concierge, bar, internet station etc. Rooms appeared no different from the other suites and were clean, beautiful decorated and well-kept. We did not have any problem with water pressure, or the air conditionning as others have mentioned. Service was great with both maid service in the morning and turn-down at night.The resort itself was as many have noted, quite large, and as a result did not feel very crowded despite the amount of people we saw at the beach. We loved the lush, tropical feel and were only sorry we didn't get a chance to discover most of its hidden treasures. To those complaining about the walk from the lobby to the beach, there were trolleys approximately every 2 minutes to pick us up and we personally loved the walks through the hotel paths (which somehow always felt quiet and secluded yet totally safe and protected). BeachNot much to say here, the beach was beautiful, both the sand which was soft and white, and the water which was a gorgeous turquoise colour. We also found an abundant amount of beach chairs and palapas always available. We also walked a lot to visit the other princess hotels situated west of our hotel and felt we had the largest and prettiest stretch of beach on the strip (though we have to admit we liked the sunbeds at the Punta Cana Princess, which are available only to VIP or platinum Princess guests)WeatherBefore we left we looked at the forecast which was advertising rain all week, well apart from the occasional tropical rain shower which usually lasted about 5 minutes, we had sun every day we were there. The weather was hot (about 30 celsius) and very humid (ladies don't bother straightening your hair) but always quite pleasant due to an always present soft ocean breeze.Entertainment:My boyfriend and I had differing views on this one; he has been to many Club Med resorts (renowned for their entertainment) and felt the Bavaro entertainment staff were very poor in comparison. However, as the nights went on he did agree that some nights were better than others. I, on the other hand, was quite impressed considering these people have to deal with an international audience (there were russians, french, english and spanish tourists present at the show while we were there), with very little money (in fact you can see right next to the theater, a sewing area where the staff makes their own costumes) and are paid very little for the amount of work they do (and they worked their little bodies crazy in that heat!). Both of us agreed that the best entertainment was the Beach Party at Caf茅 del Mar: the decor and staff were all in white and people were dancing the night away barefoot on a sand dancefloor, while bartenders poured alcohol all about 3 feet from the ocean. It was fantastic!Excursions:We chose to go do the marinarium, where you are taken by boat to a sandbed and get to swim with stingrays and nurse-sharks. Overall this was a nice experience and you get a lot for the money you pay for: lots of entertainment, you get to swim in a natural pool (created by sandbeds), drinks and snacks provided on-board and above all the opportunity to explore marine life. The only criticism we had was that we were expecting to learn more about the marine creatures we saw and felt the staff lacked some knowledge in this area. My boyfriend also went scuba-diving at our hotel diving club. Note that the platinum package includes a free dive (for those certified divers) which is not advertised, but you do end up saving a bundle of money by taking advantage of this. He found the diving to be average compared to other Caribbean destinations.Food:If there is one area that I may have something to complain about it might be the food. During our time there we ate at buffets for both breakfast and lunch, and tried 5 脿 la carte restaurants for dinner. Overall though some were better than others, they each had their redeeming qualities. For breakfast, we did find that the main lobby buffet offered more variety, but since our hotel room was about 3 feet from the El Gaucho buffet, we felt this place was more than adequate for our breakfast needs (e.g. omelets, eggs, bacon, toast, fruit etc.). We also always had coffee available to us. For lunch, we stuck to the beach buffet, which had excellent bbq meats and plenty of other side dishes (e.g. salads, fries, rice, veggies, fruits and dessert). At night, we wanted to try as many different restaurants as possible. Here's a brief summary of each: - Sakura: the asian restaurant, as some other reviewer put it, asian and dominican don't appear to mix, the main meal we had wasn't great (their asian beef appeared to be the same beef we had at the bbq for lunch) however I found the fried flamb茅 ice cream quite interesting (and tasty). - Licey: this was the gourmet restaurant available at a 25$ surcharge, but free with the platinum package. This place was good; we had a 5 course meal of nicely presented plates but felt like the food combinations lacked the attention you would normally get from a gourmet restaurant and thus we wouldn't pay to eat there. Nevertheless we felt this was a great effort considering the resources. Also, this was the only restaurant we felt had decent wine, however do remember champagne is included in the package and is the best drink we found there, and if you tip well enough you might end up with a bottle. -El Pescador (seafood): we didn't like this place, we found the service horrible (the waiters didn't ask what I wanted as a side dish and basically threw our food on the table) and disliked the tiny entrees (consisting of 5 calamari for myself and 5 shrimps for my bf) and stale desserts. However, we both felt the lobster was sublime. So don't discount this place. Also another couple we met loved this place and said they were treated like kings (even without reservations). So this goes to show people can have totally different experiences at one place.-Chopin: this was our favorite! The food was excellent. Although this place was a buffet, everything tasted so fresh, you had meats and seafood prepared in front of you, and this is the only buffet in the world I've seen offer caviar. Also, we were treated like royalty (and rewarded well by tipping generously), with unlimited champagne.  -Main buffet (Hispaniola): this was okay, we went on dominican night and this may have influenced our tastes, but I didn't like anything except for the pasta station where you have pasta prepared in front of you according to your liking (you choose the pasta, sauce and toppings). - Finally, we went to Il Baccio (Italian), which was an off-resort restaurant which we have access to (again part of the platinum package). You are also driven there with the little golf carts and driven back (but we chose to walk back with a romantic stroll on the beach which took about 15 minutes). This was another favorite, the food was delicious and plentiful and great friendly service.An important note on the food, which was what scared us most reading the reviews prior to leaving: we were not sick. But you have to be careful; coconut is a laxative and the water in the hotel room is not drinkable (and this goes for water in the shower and for teeth-brushing). Water in restaurants however is filtered as or ice cubes and we drank those liberally without getting sick. So in conclusion, to those reading these reviews when considering a hotel, please note that many experiences are quite personal, for some getting sick can totally ruin their views on the place, for others the service they receive will make or break the vacation. For us, our time at the Bavaro gave us exactly what we hoped to get out of our vacation, a relaxing time in a beautiful, romantic place which we hope to revisit soon. Oh and the platinum package goes without saying.

<Content>mixedfeelings Me (34) and my husband stayed from 14 untill 25th of December at the Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort.Room was fine and clean, not even 1 minute walk from the pool and beach. Mainly stayed at the beach which was lovely and not to busy, pool area was nice but every afternoon too much loud dance music, a bit of music is nice but this was just too much (even for a girl who so now and then likes to party).They also come on the beach or hotel lobby with a little monkey, parrots etc to make pictures which you can buy later, PLS do NOT do this, these animals should not be used for silly things like this! Also ignore the men in the lobby who tell you you can book your holiday cheaper and they just want 5 minutes of your time.It costed us 2 hours and all they want is to sell you a holidayplan for the next 30 years! Gardens are gorgeous so nice to walk around, the little trains come very regular and you do not feel you are in such a big resort.Buffet was fine but not special, a lot of the food was lukewarm. We went once to the Italian and once to the Asian restaurant were on both occasions we had our starter, maincourse and dessert within 25 minutes! Food in the Italian restuarant was very tasteless and stay away from the red and white wines.Only the seafood restaurant was a safe option.We booked twice for Cafe Del Mar (you have to pay extra) and this was very nice, a gorgeous ambiance (on the beach) , good food and the nicest staff ever.If you like the nightlife do not go to this hotel, the lobby/bar area is very boring and there is no fun to find in the evenings.If you want sun, a nice beach, do not expect to much from the food and like to go to bed early than this is your place to be!For all the others go somewere else.

<Content>A Four Star (not more) Experience - Expectations Missed Stayed 1 week December 25, 2006 at Bavaro Princess with my wife and 9 year old daughter. We travel extensively in Mexico and the Caribean mainly at 4+ and 5 star hotels. Bavaro Princess is a 4 star hotel (not 5 star). That is our main gripe because it is advertised as 5 star and expectations are that we will get a 5 star only to be disappointed.Accomodation: - room is really excellent.Food:Main Restaurant - Hispanolla, is okay but you will never walk out saying that it was great. Side restaurants - this hotel expects that you will dine 4 or 5 times at the side restaurants. Most are okay but again you will never be walking out saying that anything was fantastic.Chopin - a buffet better than Hispanolla.Gaucho- mainly beef, okay.Sakura - Chinese, okay. Miguel, the manager, understands customer service (he might be the only guy at this hotel that does).Bella Pasta- below average and service is an insult to customers. The manager at this restaurant could not care less what customers think ( a complete zero).Cafe Del Mar- OkayEl Pesquator - Fish, okayLicey- Not a 5 star, okay, extra $ Service:You expect slow service but here the service is sometimes so bad that it really is insulting. Our comments are focused on restaurant service in the main and side restaurants. The management does not care if customers like the service or not. Their attitude is that you will be leaving in a week so who cares. This is really a terrible aspect of the hotel and many customers had problems. To be treated in this way is unacceptable at any hotel. Its a management problem ! They should make Miguel ( the manager at the Sakura Restaurant) the manager of the entire hotel !The Beach- Just absolutely fantastic !Bars- Good and many. Believe me with the lack of service you will be drinking a lot !Entertainment- Very average. Couple of shows very good, some depend on guests participation, a four star performance.Four Star VS Five StarService is what really defines a 5 star and Bavaro Princess does not come close. Sure it has 8 restaurants, 8 bars, good rooms, a nice beach, some enteratinment etc but aside from quantity the quality is geared for someone with very average expectations. This is a solid 4 Star.Better ChoicePay a bit more and get a lot more by going to Paradisus or another true 5 star. Alternatively, consider even paying less and getting the same at some of the advertised 4 Star or 4+ star hotels.

<Content>Not the best I've been to Punta Cana a few times and I would NOT recommend this hotel. This is a large resort. I takes about 15 minutes to get to the beach from the restaurant in a little bus. We sometimes had to wait about 10 minutes to get a bus and then of course you would have to be quick to have a seat. When you drive through the resort, it can sometimes smell really badly... I felt sorry for the people with a room in that part of the resort. Furthermore, the food was okay in the main restaurant, but not fab. There are a la carte restaurants as well, but you have to book in advance (from about 9 am) and in our 2 weeks stay, most of the restaurants were full every night. Only were able to try one a la carte restaurant (the italian) and it wasn't special. So overall, there are a lot of better hotels in Punta Cana than this one.

<Content>Great place, but bring the Immodium General Experience / Overview:A group of us (5 in total in three separate rooms) stayed from Dec 13 to 27 2006 and had a great time overall. The beach was beautiful, the staff were friendly and weather was great (but did get a couple rainy / overcast days). The rooms, grounds and beach were all kept clean and tidy, especially given how large the complex is. The staff put on an outstanding Christmas eve buffet that would rival some of the better ones in Las Vegas with incredible displays and nearly every food imaginable, including all you can eat lobster. No complaints there.The two pools were both quite nice. We ended up going to the quiet pool more often because it was less competitive for seating and there was no blaring dance mix '94-esque music in the latter half of the afternoon (although at times people still dragged their screeching brats in, despite it being called the quiet pool).The evening entertainment events were cute in a junior high pageant kind of way. At least they tried hard, were enthusiastic and seemed to have fun doing it. Might be best left to the kids (or the really drunk).There were a few negative experiences however. Hot water was unavailable at least twice and electricity was out once for about an hour. This was complex wide and not just our room. And when I say no hot water, I mean that there was literally none available (gurgling taps, not just as though they had run out). The fitness facility (gym / weight room) was also lacking in capacity and the cardio equipment was either not functioning or of poor quality / condition. The staff seemed pretty slack in opening on time too as we had to wait for them to open it every morning (sometimes 20 minutes late).Overall we would have to rate the food as being good. The buffets offered a wide variety of food that appeared to be of good to excellent quality. The a la carte restaurants were fair to good with service generally good to excellent. Despite the five available places to choose from, after two weeks we all were growing tired of the selection. I suspect that is not unique to an all inclusive experience. The red and white wines were incredibly awful and would suggest you avoid them completely. We found the sparkling wine to be decent enough to drink by the bottle. As others here have mentioned, we also got sick from the food for the first time in our lives. Now I would like to state that all of us are well traveled and hardly inhibited when it comes to cuisine (local or otherwise). However, all five of us had varying degrees of diarrhea. Three of us were very sick for a few days with excruciating stomach pains, fever and nausea. One of us was stomach sick the entire time and from the sounds of the stalls next to us, we weren't the only guests having these issues.VIP OpinionDidn't go for the VIP service and didn't have regrets. We spoke to people who spent the extra (30USD a day per person) and all they seemed to get out of it was some bottles of rum / vodka (which only goes for about 4-9USD down there anyway never mind you can just get the bartenders to fill up whatever container you want with whatever booze you want at any time, which is what we did). The only other things you got out of it was a chance to eat at the fancy restaurant once a week and were able to access a VIP lounge (which was totally dead / nothing in it). Other perks were cigars (again dirt cheap down there) and robes and nightly maid service to turn down your bed. Supposedly you get a beach front view, but as far as we could tell, that didn't really exist and the rooms were otherwise the same. They didn't offer any special treatment at restaurants or at the beach area. So considering it would have been 60USD for us _per day_ we figured we could buy a lot of cigars and booze for that.Tips and Advice:Get a room away from the sewage processing area (I think they were around the 200's to 220's). Not exactly sure what was going on around there, but you sure smelled it every time you walked / drove by. Try and get a room that doesn't face the tram path as they can get pretty noisy and hollering drunks may wake you up at night. Not to mention everyone that goes by on the tram gets the pleasure of staring into your room (at least that seemed to be the case).Be sure to ask for a king size bed if that matters to you, otherwise you may get a twin. Not sure if they offer king size beds on the upper level rooms but you may try to go for it so you don't get stuck with a bunch of rowdy spaniards fighting and dancing in flamenco shoes at all hours of the morning/night. Also, be prepared for a topless beach and pool area (I guess that means either bring extra film or stay away altogether depending on how that suits you).Bring a decent sized drink container to take to the beach so you can have the bartender fill it up with your favorite poison so you don't need to make as many trips.If you are mobility reduced I think you would struggle here (or at least you could likely find more accommodating places). The complex is huge and the rooms have several steps inside and out.It didn't seem like it would be a great singles place either and although there were some activities / infrastructure for families, you might want to see what else is out there first.Bring lots of small US bills for the staff, they work really hard and long hours. They seemed to really appreciate the small tips now and again and likely helped in us getting such good service.

<Content>Just ok Just returned from Bavaro Princess last night. Weather was great, beach was wonderful, rooms were nice. I personally did not care for the food, and I am not a picky eater. I realize I was in a different country, so I expected different food. The dinners were better, but I did not care for the buffets. That's ok, I went for the beach, not to eat. Drinks were very good, fast service at this time of year. Our keys did not work and it took quite a few calls to get it fixed, we were told there were no safe keys, to come back tomorrow. The Apple rep. got us one immediately after we were told there weren't any. It took us 3 days to get wash rags, you might want to take your own. Maintenance came very quickly for any problems, ac was great in our room. Some restaurants were not air conditioned and it was HOT! The shows are not air cond. and have no breeze since it is away from the beach. Very hot during the shows. If you want to see some happy people, and some great smiles, take some candy and pass it out to the maids, the pool workers, maintenance and those who take care of the grounds. I layed on the beach on my 50th bday and passed out lollipops to anyone walking by, those selling excursions, and those selling jewelry or conch shells and the activity people. It was great to make so many people happy. The country is so poor that noone can afford candy. Take some crayons, markers, pens and notebooks for their children and they will love it. Our maid gave us great service when we left small gifts or tips. The trolley drivers love lollipops too. The only time we had a long wait for the trolley was Sunday am when guests were checking in, other than that it was very prompt. You may have to be pushy to get what you want, they will tell you they will take care of it, but they just don't seem to care.Please look up Medina from security and take some candy for his seven children, he was such a sweet person with a great smile. We invited him for some bday cake and I got a big hug and kiss for my bday! There are 2 Medinas one in the restaurant and one in security. Its the one in security. One complaint was when we went to get pool towels, there weren't any till the next day, they said to come at 8, but it was not open till 9. We had trouble making reservations in the nice restaurants, they will tell you they are full, but you go by and hardly anyone is eating there. Be pushy and you will get the ones you want. We were told the first night there were no reservations left, but the rest. were empty, not sure what that was all about. There is a girl at guest services who isn't so nice. She screwed our reservations for dinner up and it wasn't open when we when to eat. She also told us the shopping place opened at 8 and it was really 9am. Beware of her. Remember it is a $2 connection fee for any call from the room even if the hotel connects you. We wished we would have know that from January 15th till the end of April, the ocean is as calm as a swimming pool, thats how I like it. There are some guys selling time shares next door at Occidental, they are a lot of fun, but be sure you get everything they say you will get if you go listen to the time share talk. And they get a commission if you go listen, we did it for them. They knew we weren't going to buy. For the money, the Bavaro Princess is an ok place to stay, but remember you are going to a country where mostly no one speaks english. Very few guests spoke English either, and most women were topless, many who should not been topless in public. A few old, large men wore dental floss thongs, and changed right on the beach into tiny speedos to go into lunch. Then back into the floss thongs. There was quite a parade of boobs all day long, and they all seem to have to bend and stretch to flounce them around. You get used to it.

<Content>Good pick depending on... it was a great choice!! my husband and i were there for a friend's wedding so we had a blast. here are the facts...the place is HUGE, so be prepared to walk or you can take the shuttle. if you do end up walking, it's beautiful. it's lush and pretty. there are exotic animals all over the property (some are caged) so it's not a bad walk. the weather was fabulous (we went in november). the colour of the water was unreal, clean too. the service is good (not all that close to excellence though). rooms were clean, and safe. food was impressive! buffet had a lot of variety. didn't get sick once throughout! let me just state -- not a lot of action for single people (mostly families and couples). hope this helped!

<Content>Terrible Grauenhaft We stayed 2 weeks. Ambiente of the resort is nice (viewed from distance) If you look closer : maximum 3-star-place . Food  wine: disgusting. I talked to the manager of restaurants and services... He agreed with me!!! KidsClub: Forget it !! 2 TV Sets in the Miniclub running all day long. No kids entertainment! The kids were bored to death! Rooms: 3-star-rating maximum!! Service: non existing: f.e: you have to line up for registering in the restaurans.. (we are takling about a 5 star place).... Pool: quite dirty. Animation: boring but the evening shows are ok. Beach: nice and clean.Summary: If don't expect 5 star food, service, etc it's ok but remember: don't pay more than for a 3 star hotel!!

<Content>Sick in Paradise A family group of four adults when to this resort in third week of November 2006 and were EXTREMELY sick from the food. We were all very careful in our food selection choices, however we were all violently ill. We spoke to other patrons from other countries and they also had become sick. We don't know the exact cause as yet but we are seeking medical advice. The grounds were meticulous and the weather was simply wonderful, however we spent the a great majority of our holiday time in the loo. This was our second trip to the Dominican Republic and after this experience WE WILL NEVER BE RETURNING. Signed, Stil feeling the effects.....Winnipeg, Manitoba

<Content>Wonderful vacation I wrote an extensive review of this hotel over a week ago but as I have not yet seen it I am now doing a shorter version.My husband and I stayed here from October 29 - November 12. We were very pleased that we booked the Platinum package through Air Canada Vacations. Their Representative Mylene was fantastic. The Guest Services Manager Armando Vargas was also wonderful.The check in was done in the Platinum Lounge so there were no long line ups. Check out was the same. I will not go into details about the beach except to say that we never had any problems finding chairs. The gardens were magnificent. There is a very nice ecology walk. Ask the trolley driver to let you off at the Mangrove Bridge. We had a Continental Breakfast in the Platinum Lounge. We ate so much during th day we did not need a big breakfast. You could go there for drinks in the afternnon and evening. In the morning you booked your a la carte dinners there. We tried all of them the first week and picked our favourites the second week.They were the Sakura, Chopin and Bella Vista. At 8.30 in the Chopin a small boat appeared on the little lake. There was a piano player in the boat. He played for about 1/2 hour.We also had a free dinner at the Licey Gourmet Restaurant through the Platinum package. The food was very good and very well presented but we did not think that it was worth the $25 surcharge.The soups in the beach Buffet Restaurant were the best that I have ever had in a hotel.Many of the reviews mentioned the lack of water pressure. We had a lovely room close to the water. The first week we were downstairs and the second week upstairs but that made no difference. This was our only complaint. We rarely got face cloths so if you use them you would be advised to bring your own.The suites were large and very clean. In addition to the fridge which contained beer and pop we had a dispenser with 3 bottles of liquor.My husband really enjoyed the 4 Dives that he went on. We also went on 2 snorkelling trips out to the reef which were included. You got a good view of the coastline from the boat. The fish and coral were terrific. Unfortunately the waves were very high.We were delighted to find out that there was Mass at 5.30 on Sunday evening. There were not many people there possibly beause it was not well advertised.The Duty free place at the airport was closed on the Sunday evening. A small gift shop finally opened. It sold beer and rum. The local rum was $25 for a 26 oz.We will certainly go back to this hotel. We have been travelling to the Dominican on and off for the last 25 years. The staff, food etc were the best yet at the Bavaro Princess.

<Content>A great holiday, but with some problems Wanted to advise you of some good and bad points, along with a few problems with the Bavaro Princess resort, Punta Cana, D.R. during our stay, November 18-25, 2006.I also wanted to advise you of the great service my family  I received from the Signature tour representative, Wegge.Our party consisted of 7 guests, my parents, who are both seniors and my mother requires the use of a cane to walk and is unable to climb stairs, my daughter, my girlfriend and her sister and brother-in-law.This was my second visit to the Bavaro Princess resort. I emailed (in Spanish, allowing for the difficulties in translation) the resort approximately 1 week prior to our departure to again request a ground floor room for my parents  daughter and that we all be housed in the same building.CHECK-IN:We arrived at the resort to find out they had assigned my parents  daughter to an upper level room and my girlfriend  I the ground floor (got it backwards). This problem was rectified after trying to explain just to switch us around with the rooms.Also we had requested, through our travel agent that we all be situated near the main lobby are in buildings 48-58 (for my parents) instead we were placed down by the beach area. Further we were all placed in 3 different buildings throughout the resort. ROOMS:There was a lovely return guest welcoming fruit basket, bottle of rum and t-shirts, which was a nice touch.On a sour note, our assigned rooms (mine and my parents) had no hot running water for showering and only a trickle of water would come out of the showerhead. I called the front desk and reported the problem early in the morning of our 1st day, where they assured me it would be looked after. Upon our return to the room in the evening, we went to shower, but there was still no hot water. I again contacted the front desk and they sent a plumber, who looked at the amount of water pressure and advised Si, there is no hot water. I later learned that this was the same for the platinum guests.During this time I requested they we be moved to other rooms. This is where I had contact with the Signature Vacations representative Wegge. He called me at my room after being advised by hotel staff of the problem. Wegge took control of the situation and advised me to meet him tomorrow (Monday) due to the late hour and we would attempt to rectify the problem.We met on the Monday morning and Wegge approached one of the reception supervisors, Amoury and advised him of our situation. Due to the large volume of guests arriving and departing during the day we were not promised that anything could be done about changing our rooms.With Wegge badgering the supervisor, he finally relented and provided up with 2 new rooms, closer to the main lobby (as we had originally requested), so we moved late Monday evening. Finally hot water!!!!!!!!!Our new room was not without its own share of problems as well, the air conditioner did not work (that we could live with), but the most disgusting thing was the cockroaches in our room. We found 2 dead ones on 2 separate mornings and 2 climbing the walls. Thankfully this was within a day or two of us departing. Both the air conditioner and the cockroach problem were reported to the hotel staff and the room was fumigated upon our check out (this we know as the fumigator was waiting for us to leave the room).OVERALL:All in all our stay at the Bavaro Princess was wonderful and my entire party had a great time. The food was fabulous, the entertainment staff was wonderful, the grounds are spectacular, and the staff was cheerful and courteous, always with a hola.However, as this was my second time at this resort it is now time to move on and try other locations.

<Content>Great Resort We stayed here from November 13 to the 20th. The resort itself was very beautiful and clean. It was huge but there are cart buggys that make circles around the resort and help you get where you are going. The food. Everything tasted great and all. The choices were quite vast. We ate all but the Platinum resteraunt and I have to say that the service was slow. Some of the waiters were forgetful and the portions were too small. The appetizer for the seven of us was 6 small cocktail shrimp in the Japanese resteraunt. We waited much too long for our desserts which were spoon sized. Needless to say, all of us were releaved when we ate at the buffet in the main lobby on the last day. I hate to be one of the food complainers but count me in as one of the ones that got sick from the food. I am pretty sure that it was the meat. I had an upset stomach for a lot of the trip and a mild fever for one of the days. The beach. Not much to add. It was beautiful and everything you can expect for a beach from paradise. The weather. Not really part of the resort, but I was worried when I noticed that it was supposed to rain showers the whole time that we were there. There were only a couple showers throughout the whole week during the day. Each lasting no more than 10 minutes. An exception was when a huge storm hit on around Nov. 17-18 when it was beginning to get dark. The mini hurricane lasted for a couple hours, bringing with it the loudest thounder I have ever heard. One time it came so close to the beach that it literally made everyone jump 2-4 feet. Remember, mostly those who have something to complain about write these things, so don't let this be representative of everyone views that went there. I am not going to go there again simply because I don't like going to the same place twice. I missed the place the moment I shut the door for the last time.Have an incredible time!

<Content>A little bit disappointed My husband and I stayed at the Bavaro Princes for 3 nights from November 6 to November 9th. We use the Platinum upgrade and were glad that we did. We had room 724 which had a great view and very easy access to beach and pool. The usefulness of the lounge is worthwhile. You have access to more water, soft drinks, liquor and snacks at almost any time of the day or night. Plus the free internet access made it easy to keep in touch with those back home. I will be honest....although we had a very nice relaxing time, I'm not sure I would go back. I can't rave about this trip as others have done....Yes we had a good time, yes the hotel was very nice, but there were things that I was disappointed in. For instance:ROOM--it was spacious and the bed was very comfortable, but it was definitley in need of some sprucing up. The door knobs were loose, the faucets were kind of old and water stained. The shower curtain was cheap and flimsy. The water pressure was horrible to say the least. At times it was only a trickle and this was after a long day of sun and sand! We also had some ants in the bathroom sink area around the basket of soaps and shampoo--all of which was cheap and almost used looking---as if the prior guests didnt want it and it was left there for us. Well, I didnt want it either. The towels were also, small, scratchy and old, although there were plenty of them. BIG tip on the room--dont go out on the balcony and let the door close behind you--it locks--and if you're key is inside, you;'re stuck outside....thank goodness my husband was coming up shortly with his key. GROUNDS---very nice, with lots of lush tropical foilage, which of course leads to lots of shade. The grounds are immense-I wont go into details as others have....we never had a problem getting a tram, or the ride up to the lobby. No problems here.FOOD---We ate at the lobby buffet every morning for breakfast and for dinner one night. We also used El Peascador, the fish place and Licey. The buffet was good for breakfast and ok for dinner--nothing special--but not bad either. El Pescador was not good. When I read the menu before we booked it, I knew I wanted the surf and turf. When we got to the restaurant, I was told they had no surf and turf.. The waiter was completely unapologetic, and seemed to be annoyed with me then, as nothing else on the menu appealed to me. I ended up getting the grilled lobster, along with my husband. The lobster actually wasnt too bad, but the portion was very small. I will add about this restaurant , that the service left a lot to be desired. My appetizer and my soup came at the same time. There was no napkin on the table when we sat down and the aforementioned waiter seemed totally unhappy in his job. They also let a man in who was wearing shorts, even after all the warnings about men needing long pants for the restaurants. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was 4 small popcorn shrimp size shrimp with a type of tartar sauce instead of cocktail sauce. My husband had the house wine, took one sip and said it tasted like vinegar. Well, on to better things.......LICEY, the finest restaurant there. It was included in the Platinum package and it was the highlight of our trip, food wise. They had the absolute best bread I have ever tasted. The bread was small doughnut hole size balls of the finest, tastiest, slightly garlic tasting, bites of bread--so good we asked for another bowl of it and they quickly complied and gladly served it. The service here was excellent, the food delicious (though still somewhat smaller portions) and the atmosphere was quite pleasant. ENTERTAINMENT-- The main show in the lobby starts at 10 PM.. This was a little late for me, after being out in the sun and water all day. The one show we did stay for was very nice. The production was pretty with nice costumes and dancing, but all it was seemed to be the same kind of dance, just done in different costumes. The poolside/beachside entertainment didnt interest us, and we didnt see a lot of it. I know they had it, cause the music was very loud, but we didnt see a lot of participation. BEACH---nice size, enough lounges and palapa's that we never had a problem finding one. Sand was very nice, soft and clean. The water on the other hand was a big disappointment to me. I found it very rough, and not at all clear. The waves were huge and I got knocked over getting in and out. You had to work your way-way out over the shoreline to get to smoother water, then you had to fight to get back to the shore. I wasnt impressed and I knew going in it wasnt going to be crystal clear, but I was hoping for calmer water. Maybe we were just there at a rough time. POOL--Wonderful size, lots of space in the water--not as clean as I would have liked. It also seemed to need to be repainted, as there were a lot of chips and cracks. But the water was warm and the pool bar was never so crowded you couldnt get served. All in all, we had a very nice time. We met some very nice people (Hi Moe!) and enjoyed ourselves and that's what counts the most. Three nights was just right for us. I went to Punta Cana with an open mind, and it lived up to some expectations and I was disappointed in some--we did not experience any stomach problems at all. We were very careful with the tap water and food, although my husband ate a little bit of almost everything. I watched the coconut drinks and stuck to rum punch for most things. I did taste the Coco Loco and the Banana MAma, both of which were excellent......didnt have as many as I would have liked, but enjoyed what I did drink. One more thing I was a little taken aback by was the very high humidity. I knew it was going to be humid, but even the air conditioned places left a lot to be desired. Other than your own room, there were few places to cool off.Overall, the Bavaro Princess is a nice place to go, as long as you are not expecting a 5 star resort. i would be more likely to give it 3 out of 5. This is what we felt--only our opinions and thoughts---as shown by other peoples reviews, your stay could be entirely different. Go and enjoy, keep an open mind and dont overindulge. You should have a great time!

<Content>You are definitely treated like royalty at the Bavaro Princess(Merritt B.C.) Date visited: Nov 10-17, 2006We stayed in the Platinum Lounge we paid a little more when we got there to stay in the lounge but it was worth it. We didnt have to wait in line to make dinner reservations we had access to the internet we had all the premium liqour. We were treated like royalty. I would definitely suggested taking the plantinum package. The groungs are beautiful, the beach is like very clean and the sand is amazing like powder between your toes. The food was pretty good and the staff was amazing. The only complaint I had was the hot water pressure in our room a couple of times and the annoying market people that harass you to come visit there shop. The seem to take it personally if you go to the shop beside them and dont visit theirs. I could have done without them. For tours we went on the outback safari which was good. You get a bit queezy being on the back of a jeep on a bumpy road for hours in the heat drinking. But you get to see the real punta cana which is a must if your visiting a county might as well take the time to see the people and how they live. I would recommend this resort, well Punta Cana in general. I hope to come back soon!!

<Content>Go for the Beach! We are a young couple (34  35 y.o.) and this was our first all-inclusive, first time in Punta Cana / Carribean. We stayed in the Platinum Suites, which I think was the only option with our vacation provider from Oct 7 - 14. Hard to say if it is worth the surcharge from our inexperience. Making dinner reservations was a cinch, although being low season, perhaps there isn't much of a line at the regular reservation area (which is just outside the main breakfast buffet area anyway). The extra a la carte restaurant (Licey) included was not that good. The service was slow (just a tad faster than the seafood one) and the food was mediocre. We did use the free 20 min. massage during a day of hard rain, which was very nice if you forget about their attempt to upsell you for a longer massage. The free internet was a very nice convenience even though you usually have to wait around 15 min before 1 of 2 computers are free; also, one of the servers would be down fairly often. The other very nice perk is having the bungalows right by the beach. That was very handy when we wanted to make a pitt stop after breakfast, etc. before heading down to the water. We chose the included banana boat ride as recommended by the tour rep, over the snorkelling. We got dunked 3 times and while somewhat glad we experienced it, I wouldn't pay for it and won't be doing that again ever!We went to the beach daily and loved it. It was relatively quiet, but busy enough for us! No problems getting drinks or sunbeds. Sand was clean and water gorgeous. We were disappointed by the lack of off-shore snorkelling. The water is too rough (sandy) and there's nothing to see. One has to hire a snorkelling taxi (not sure if they are legit) or go one of the tours, which are $60USD and up. We decided to save our snorkelling for when we go to Hawaii where the fish are bountiful off shore. We learned to sail a small catamaran / Hobie Craft? for $25USD/couple and that was a good experience. We weren't expecting the class surcharge, but it was worth it despite having hard time understanding past the accents! We also used the kayaks and it was something to do. The view isn't much better from the boat and again, there isn't really anywhere to go or so other than the shoreline of the many resorts. Oh well, it burned some calories for more drinks! The food is really not that great and we are not fast food / fine dining addicts; we enjoy multicultural, middle of the road type of restaurants and home cooking. Fortunately our appetite was very low from the inactivity, heat and free drinks! But we always found something to fill our tummies. We were very pleasantly surprised that we liked the Italian restaurant the best. Aergintinian steakhouse - very fast service, steak average (was lacking the all important steak rub). Sakura - nicely decorated; good attempt (we are Chinese) but on the salty side. Seafood - my husband got sick; service was terrible and there were many people who looked angry; food not particularly tasty. Italian - fairly efficient, Mariachi band (make sure you have tip money before agreeing to a song!), food was actually yummy!. In particular, we tried: spinach  ricotta crepe, meat lasagna, chicken parmesan  spaghetti, (chocolate) ice cream in sambuca (yumm) and tiramisu. Despite my gripe, I do appreciate having all the available a la carte restaurants as I'm sure they offered better food than the buffet suppers; we only had 1 dinner at the buffet. The lunch is incredibly repetitive; the snack bar seems to offer only hamburgers and fries. Watch out for their posted meal hours as they tend to start late and pack up early. I bet the food is all fairly mediocre at all-inclusives given the amount one pays and the limitations of cooking in bulk.The entertainment at night is also not very good. The best one is the Lion King and even still, we had to keep in our minds that their budget is limited. The effort they put into the Lion King production is remarkable though. Perhaps if you are travelling with a bunch of people and take full advantage of the free flowing booze, then the entertainment is worthwhile. We opted to borrow the DVD's available through the Platinum Lounge instead. Checked out the casino and it was dead; dance club wasn't open yet when we went by. The suites are very spacious and fairly nicely decorated, although fixtures could use some upkeep / updating. We especially enjoyed the balcony at the end of the day. We didn't see any sunrises / sunsets (wrong side of the island I suppose) which was an unexpected surprise. We saw one huge cockroach (at least they don't fly there I suppose) and a bunch of tiny ants which grossed me out near the end of the stay. Not bad considering the humidity and country I suppose. We asked to switch rooms from the 1st floor to 2nd for more privacy. We felt we had to close the curtains on the ground level but that cut out all natural light. The only really negative experience was that after a couple nights there, I found that my massage bar that I had just bought for the trip was missing from the bar fridge. I told the front desk (the guy who seemed to be in charge) and he said he would talk to housekeeping. After a few days, I had to go up to him and ask what was the result and he said that they did not take it. And that was the end of that. So tipping the maid came to a screeching halt after that. Too bad we had already tipped this front desk staff member for changing our room.Punta Cana is as gorgeous as we hoped and we are glad that we went to the Carribean. However, given the long flights and long layovers, and the feeling of confinement to the resort area, we won't be going back. We would rather go to Hawaii which is a lot closer or take a direct flight to the Mayan Riviera next time.Hope this helps!from Vancouver, BC

<Content>Bavaro Princess is Wonderful-Go Platinum! My husband and I went to Punta Cana for our honeymoon from May 22 - May 29. It was wonderful. Just to let you know our past vacations, we've been to Florida, Canada, Ocean City and Myrtle Beach. GO PLATINUM!My biggest recommendation if you stay at Bavaro Princess is that you get the upgraded package known as the Platinum Package. It is SO worth it. We were treated like royalty. We didn't have to wait in line every day for dinner reservations (which you must do if you are not Platinum and the line is LONG and you have to get up at like 7:00 a.m. to get in line). Also with the Platinum Package, you get access to the Platinum Lounge which supplies you with wonderful service for anything you need, free internet and emails (which is great to contact family and MUCH cheaper than phone calls) and access to breakfast, sandwiches and drinks all day. TAKE WHAT YOU NEED!Things are much more expensive in Punta Cana so I suggest you take everything you need (sunsceen, toothpaste). We bought a hanky and a bag of chips and it was $8.00.NICE ROOMS AND GREAT SERVICE!The rooms are nice. They are clean and decorated nice. We didn't really spend that much time in the room. With the Platinum Package, we were extremely close to the beach! If your not Platinum, you could be a 10 minute walk from the beach. We left are maid a $3.00 tip everyday and we had PLENTY of fresh flowers, drinks and towels everyday. $3.00 may seem like a lot but remember, these people have nothing and everything is inclusive so it didn't kill us to leave her a few bucks a day. GOOD FOOD!My biggest concern when going to another country was the food. I was so afraid that we were going to get sick. I stayed away from most meats and didn't eat anything that I wasn't sure what it was. Most of the time we ate at the buffett in the huge hut by the beach and the one in the main lobby (you have to try the Pasta Station there, it's wonderful). They had french fries, pizza (not American pizza, but it was still good), hot dogs, salads (which I stayed away from) and many delicious deserts. As for the restaurants, we liked the Italian restaurant, the sea food restaurant and Goucho. If you go Platinum, you get a complimentary dinner at Licey. We checked out the menu before making reservations and decided to pass. The food was not our style (the had ox on the menu). Basically with the food, be smart about your choices, don't over eat (because it's so hot there) and drink alot of water.DRINKS!I'm not much of drinker. It is so hot down there all I wanted to drink water (make sure its BOTTLED WATER!) Don't even brush your teeth without bottled water. If you try a drink, you have to try a Coco Loco, ther're great. THINGS TO DO!WIth the Platinum Package, you get a free massage (which we didn't do) and a free water sport. We took a boat and went snorkling. I had a great time but my husband got sea sick and threw up. If you can't handle a small boat with big waves, I suggest you try something else. Another thing we did was called the Marinarium which was the highlight of our trip. It cost us $70.00 a piece and it was so worth it. You get on a bus and go to marina (you get to see the poverty of Punta Cana on the way. It's kinda sad) Then you get on a glass bottom boat and get to go snorkling with sting rays, fish and nurse sharks (which don't have teeth). Afterwards you get back on the boat have a sandwich and Coco Locos, cookies with music and dancing. The crew of the boat put on a great show. We had tons of fun and it was so worth $140.00!!!!!! RELAXATION!If you need to relax, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU! TOTAL RELAXATION!! We had an excellent time and would highly recommend Bavaro Princess and Punta Cana.

<Content>Honeymoon Heaven I'm a bit late in writing my review but the memories are still fresh!To start, we upgraded to the platinum club and it was well worth it! The private lounge alone was worth it. The personal service you receive from the lounge staff are excellent. We booked our meals the first night there for the entire week which worked well. We went to the texmex at the princess AWESOME filet mignon. We were chauffered there by one of the lounge staff and picked up afterwards. GREAT SERVICE!Our room was outstanding. The Bathroom was huge and great space to get ready. Mind you there was somewhat of a moldy odor coming from the room which was rectified immediately! We enjoyed a special honeymoon dinner for all honeymooners at he resort.The beach was fantastic if you can't get a cabana walk a little further down the beach and there was always loads of them. Or if you get up early and go grab one before breakfast that worked as well.If you can do at least one of the excursions. We went on the 007 for the day which was great for my husband and I really enjoyed the snorkelling. Then one day we spent just a little over 9hrs on a tour of Punta Cana so we saw a sugar cane field, school, market, ranch for buffet lunch  horse back riding, and a special tour of someones home AMAZING!If you have an opportunity to go don't miss the chance!

<Content>This is a fantastic place to stay I have stayed at many resorts over the last 15 years - I travel to the carribean usually 3 or 4 times a year. I have been to Dominican 14 times alone! I have got to say that I have NEVER seen such a beautiful resort as the Bavaro Princess. The grounds are absolutely impeccable and this is a massive resort (the biggest one that I have ever stayed at). It is without a doubt one of the great hotels in Dominican Republic.The food was probably one of the best that I have had at any all-inclusive. It is almost laughable that anyone would find something to complain about. The selection of food was incredible. We had steak, lobster, shrimp, fish, along with the selection of turkey, chicken, pork and literally every kind of different food that you could think of. The deserts were too hard to resist - all 20 different ones every day! We tried all the a-la-cartes and they were all really good. Anybody that would find anything to complain about has obviously not done too much travelling. To summarize: The beach is beautiful. The hotel is amazing. The suite was very nice. The staff is really friendly and always helpful. The food was great. Don't read these ridiculous reviews of bad food. Just get your ticket and GO - you absolutely will not regret it. I will not stay anywhere else in Domincan Rep. in the future.

<Content>What a wonderful place. First off I would like to say I am not sure what the bad reviews were talking about. I read most of the reviews for this hotel and I was pretty worried about going. We stayed there 9/11-9/16. Once we got there I was blown away. First GO PLATUIM. You don' t have to wait to check in and out. You can make all your reservations at one time. Our room was great number 701. It was a little musty smelling at first but you get use it to. The groungs were so pretty. you have to see the sun rise. The food was food. You are in a different county and remember that. We did not get sick once. I was a little disappointed in Licey. We waited 50 minutes before they asked us what we wanted to drink. Services was not the best but the food was great. All the drinks were very watered down. We stuck to wine. The best place we ate was the pasta bella. One thing i did not like was the restruants were all filled by the time we got there. You could not reserve anything. They were all booked. Over all the people were so nice and wonderful. Please tip them, once you see how they live, you will or should be very thankful for everything you have. I had a really good time. You will have a great time.

<Content>Great Time We were here a group of 5 in April and had a great timeThe beach was great, the food was good and overall we had a great time. The only downfall in our opinion is that the resort is to big. We much prefer a resort where you can walk from one end to the other in minutes and not have to wait for a trolley.

<Content>The Food is not good! Hello Everyone, My girfriend and I stayed at this resort from September 1st through 8th and I gotta say that the review below mine is right on the dot. Everything was above average (grounds, beach, pool, staff) EXCEPT the food! Both of us got sick from it on our last 2 days. The restaurants had all the same food and we got pretty sick of eating rice for 7 days straight because either the meat looked like it was standing out for quite a while or was tasteless (they added a lot of salt to all of our food to give it flavor). I loved the overall experience but I would return because of the food since I am still sick to my stomach, even after being back for 3 days.

<Content>We'll be back My husband, daugter, son and myself just returned from our first trip to the Dominican Republic - and overall we were thrilled with the resort and the people.The staff are super friendly, and go out of their way to make you feel welcome and pampered. If you don't speak Spanish, take the time to learn a few words - it makes life so much easier.The rooms are clean and a good size - though the ants that get in everywhere are a bit of a problem - and they bite!If you want to tip the maids, remember that you get a daytime and an evening maid, so a couple of dollars on the pillow for each of them is nice. We were told by a friend who's husband lived in the Dominican, that the Dominican people love candy, so we took a bag of Werthers with us, and left 2 or 3 with the maid's tip everyday.The pool bar is lovely - just the right temperature and the bartenders very liberal with their free pour drinks. Whether you choose to tip them or not - ( we tipped a couple of dollars everyday ) they treat everyone to big smiles and a few friendly words everytime you swim up. The grounds are spotless and a true tropical paradise - the baby peacocks with their Mom's were a delight.The beaches are powder white sand, and we never had a problem finding chairs to lounge on. It was more of a problem at the pool, where people tend to leave their towels, even though they might have left the area.Ladies, pamper yourselves at the Spa - it's worth it :-)When you go to the restaurants, don't expect north american size portions, the meals tend to be on the small side. It was fine for me, but our son who's a 22 year old army brat, often ordered room service a couple of hours or so before we went to eat.If you're a scuba diver - remember that with the Platinum package you get a free dive for each week you stay. We got 8 free dives for the 4 of us because we stayed 2 weeks. The dive centre is great - and Sabrina, one of the dive masters, was lots of fun to dive with.The downside of the trip for my daughter was the extraodinarily huge phone bill she got when she arrived home. She spent about 40 mins on the phone during the 2 weeks we were there, talking to her fiance and using the 800 number that is posted in the rooms. Her phone bill was almost $400!!If you take the time to go outside the resort grounds, you will be inundated by the store owners, who all want you to go into their shops to buy souvenirs. It can be a bit imtimidating,even though they're all very friendly. The outside excursions don't neccessarily live up to their hype - the stables where we went to ride, made us sad for the conditions of the animals.Having said that though , the ups FAR outweigh the downs - we'll definately return and learn more Spanish before we do - it's their language after all, and we're the visitors.Enjoy your trip - and maybe we'll see you there :-)

<Content>Nice Resort, not-so-nice food My girlfriends and I spent our annual vacation at the Bavaro Princess from 7/14 - 7/17 and here is a brief synopsis of our trip. Our trip was booked through Apple Vacations who were very good about making the reservations and providing us with all the appropriate information. We booked the Platinum package which included access to the Platinum lounge (which is always stocked with beverages and munchies), a 20 minute massage, free meal at the resort's gourmet restaurant and one watersport activity. We had an early flight and arrived in Punta Cana at 9:30 am. After going through DR customs we were met by an Apple representative and whisked away on a bus to the hotel. The ride was about 35 - 45 minutes with one stop (to another resort). After our arrival, we went to the main check-in and was greeted by a waiter passing out cool drinks which turned out to be loaded with sugar. The drink was so unbearable that we tried to dilute it with water but it didn鈥檛 deaden the sweetness. The lobby of the hotel however, is beautiful and well kept. We were greeted with smiles and holas which was pleasant. After being led to the Platinum check -in, we boarded a tram which gave us a tour of the grounds. The resort is simply fabulous with greenery, flowers, flamingos, parrots, peacocks, etc and is identical to the pictures presented. Because there were four of us (two to a room), we had hoped that our suites would be adjacent to one another but instead were on opposite sides of the Platinum Lounge. Our rooms were very nice and well-maintained. The shower was hot in our room but the water pressure was somewhat weak improving over the course of our stay. My friend's room had no hot shower water at all. Some people on TA complained of a faint sewage odor and we could smell something in our room but it was not overbearing. In regards to reading the reviews of the food, we had hoped that the previously posted reviewers were exaggerating; however, this was NOT the case. By the end of the trip, one of us fell ill to the food; another was hit with something upon arriving home and all of us left the resort with an overall bad taste in our mouths. As my friend (who got sick) puts it: the food was merely an assembly line where they re-packaged it for the different restaurants. What was served on the lunch buffet was served at dinner. The safest bet was to eat the fruit and fish which was good. We were required to make reservations to all of the restaurants but once we got there, we couldn鈥檛 see the point. Again, we saw the same food at every single restaurant over and over and over 鈥?For the most part, the beverages were okay (very sweet). Because the food was horrific, we will not go back to Punta Cana --- it seems that from reading the reviews from ALL resorts in Punta Cana, the food leaves a lot to be desired. When you are on holiday, food is part of the experience and can make an impact on your visit as it was the case here. Overall, the beaches, grounds, rooms and staff were very nice and hospitable. But, that's not enough to bring us back.

<Content>very nice vacation Just came back from Punta Cana, DR. (dates Aug 20th to 26th)Myself my husband and my 5yr old daughter had a great time. It was our first time there and I have to say that we loved it the beach, pool, food ect.... the staff were great to us very friendly and kind. I have to say these people work very hard day and night especially the entertainment staff. anyway just wanted people to know the experience that we had over there. the only thing I didn't like was that some people would reserve the beach chairs and were never around to use them which is not fair to other people especially traveling with small childrens. I tried not to let that bother me since my husband didn't like to sit out on the sun anyway and the little one was always in the water. I also have to say that we did not have to use any insect repelent because there were no mosquitos at all thank God. The shopping experience was a different story we went outside the resort across the street to shop and it was to funny people would pressure you into there store for you to look around and talk you into buying something, anything but I guess that's how these people make there living. so if your thinking about staying here it is a very nice and clean resort and a beautiful and relaxing place to be (check it out and enjoy) NJ, USA

<Content>A wonderful vacation at the Bavaro Princess We spent eight days and seven nights at the Bavaro Princess and loved it! The resort was nothing less than a tropical paradise and we already are making plans to return next year. The all-inclusive nature of the resort allows you to sample just about everything at the resort without worrying about carrying around dollars -- although we found that leaving a dollar or two here and there really was appreciated by the resort staff. (Apparently, there's a higher platinum level at the resort that enables you to receive top-shelf liquor and other benefits - like free dinners at the upscale Licey restaurant - and these are not free) The beach was spectacular, and there were just so many highlights at the resort: the swim-up bar at the main pool; the constant supply of unlimited tropical drinks; the onsite spa/jacuzzi; the zoo in the middle of the property (it's not really marked on the outside and consists mostly of birds, but there's a guy inside who cuts down coconuts for visitors); the romantic atmosphere at restaurants like Chopin (in the evenings, there's live music by a guy on a gondola), and the geniality of the staff (almost everyone you pass will say Hola! to you). Plus, there's a total of 7 restaurants on the property (6 of them completely free), so you have a nightly choice of Asian cuisine (a hybrid of Japanese and Chinese), Argentinian steak, international food, seafood and Italian cooking to complement the main buffet restaurant. Before we went, we read through the comments posted here, and quite honestly, we had a number of concerns before arriving at the resort. Some complained about the quality of the food, others lamented the lack of English-speaking staff at the resort, and yet others warned about the problems with the water. In general, if you plan to eat burgers and pizza rather than sample the very nice seafood paella or engage in American pastimes like golf and poker rather than experiment with salsa and meringue, then you may be a bit frustrated. The overall experience is much more suited for someone with a familiarity or appreciation for the best parts of Dominican culture. Having spent 8 days there, I really don't see how anyone could complain about the food - generally, we ate at the main buffet restaurant in the mornings and afternoons, and one of the reservation-only restaurants at night. At the all-you-can-eat buffets, you can pick and choose whatever looks interesting for the day (there's usually someone preparing cook-to-order fish or chicken) and drink as much wine or beer as you want. Plus, the food at restaurants like Chopin and El Gaucho was truly exceptional. Just be sure to order the meat well done - if you order it medium rare like back in the States, I don't think the meat will be cooked thoroughly enough.In terms of the staff, we found them to be friendly and helpful. Of course, if you speak Spanish, it makes things much easier. Some of the workers at the front desk struggled a bit with the English, but did their best to make our stay as pleasant as possible. As I mentioned above, nearly everywhere you go, people say Hola! - even when you're not expecting it. (Some workers ride bicycles around the resort property, but always attempted to make eye contact and say hello).Oh - and there were no flying insects as one of the other reviewers mentioned. We came fully equipped to deal with this problem, but didn't even need to take any anti-bug measures.Anyway, we went as part of a package deal arranged by Apple Vacations. Anytime we had questions that the hotel couldn't answer, we looked for the Apple guy at the resort. It seems like most of the visitors were there with similar types of tourism operators, so I guess things are easiest if you go with a small group of other visitors.A few words of advice: do not drink the water - under any condition! Not even while brushing your teeth. There's free bottled water available at the lobby bar, and the housekeeping staff keeps the room fridge stocked with bottled water, so there's no need. One night I got a bit lazy and ended up with some very painful stomach cramps the next day. And the next day. And the next day. As a general rule of thumb, the more effort you make to speak Spanish, to learn about the Dominican culture, and to participate in events around the resort (there's a team of animation experts), the more you'll enjoy your stay. I guess that's true of any foreign country, but seemed to be especially true here -- mainly because of the large influx of Spanish, French, and other European visitors to the resort. Because of the strong Euro, it seemed like there were more Europeans than Americans at the resort - despite the relative proximity of the Dominican Republic to the USA.

<Content>Beautiful resort, but don't go for the food My boyfried and I really loved the entire resort. It was beautiful all around. The grounds were lovely. We enjoiyed the nightly shows, despite the lack of air conditioning. Our room layout provided for a Grand-First-Impression. We could see the ocean from our bed. LOVE IT(had to pay extra for ocean view, but well worth it). The food....that's another story. The breakfast and lunch were by far better than any dinner in all respects- selection and taste. The food quality at the Italian Restaurant was a JOKE. Taste processed, and as if it just came out of a jar. Truly awful. Went to bed on an empty stomach. Again, really enjoyed breakfast and Lunch. I Don't drink alcohol, and wondered... what better place to drink fresh squeezed fruit juice than a Caribean Island? Sadly, the bar did not carry any natural juice. Instead it taste as if it were from concentrate or straight from a can...was only able to obtain natural juice during breakfast. The most delicious meal we had in DR was outside the resort when we ate at a local dive during our drive to Punta Cana. Other faults: No consistency on the night club's hours of operation. No problem, Areito(club at Hotel next door) to the rescue.I always looked down on Americans, despite living in NYC all my life, and was initially trilled to be sorrounded by so many Europeans. In my short stay, I grew to dislike the European's UNNECESSARY arrogance towards everyone including the staff. Is there any reason to obnouxiously skip everyone at a bar? A word of advise: Yes, it's an all-inclusive, but it won't break anyone if as a token of appreciation, you tipped your waiters every now and then. I'm not saying to leave your wallet behind, simply to be open minded and recognize the staff for their efforts. There's no reason to admire anyone that can be so rude, lack compassion, and be cheap! I suppose Americans do have class after all!Yes, we will return for it's beautiful grounds, pool, lovely beach and hospitality. And best of all, we won't gain much weight, as our experience has taught us dinner should not be on our top agenda =)LDVFlushing, NY

<Content>Amazing Experience!! My husband and I just returned from our trip to Punta Cana. We had the most fabulous time at the Bavaro Princess Resort. First of all the resort is absolutely beautiful from the rooms to the lovely landscaping and walkways. Our room was about a five minute walk to the beach which was absolutely lovely, I have never seen anything like it. That is where we spent most of our time. We thought the food was great. Of course with any buffet you go to there are some things you like and some things you don't like and we always managed to find something we liked. The a la carte restaurants that we went to were also very good especially El Gaucho, the Argentinian steak was the best thing I've ever tasted. The best a la carte restaurant in our opinion was Cafe Del Mar. It's fairly new and is not actually on the list of restaurants at the reservation desk. We actually stunbled across it our first night there and booked it for the following evening. It is not included in the standard package but let me tell you this is a treat (especially for couples) that should not be missed. The restaurant is right on the beach and unlike other restaurants that have specific seatings you can stay there from the time it opens at 6:30 to the time it closes at 1am. They have beds laid out that are raised off the sand some with canopies. You can have your table moved down by the beach or eat your fabulous 3 course gourmet meal on one of the beds. Your wish is their command. They play fabulous mello music and you can dance on the beach. The staff is so friendly and obliging. It was definitely the highlight of our trip.The only word of caution I would have is to be careful with the Coconut Cream drinks such as 'Coco Loco' they are very tasty but Coconut Cream is a natural laxative that can put a bit of a damper on your trip for a day or 2 if you have too many. All in all our trip was great. The staff was very professional and helpful. If you go there with an open mind and don't expect perfection with every little thing you will have a fabulous time. We certainly did and would definitely go back.

<Content>Hot! Hot!! Hot!!! Bavaro Princes - Punta CanaJuly 17-24 2006 , travel with husband and 12 year old daughter.Loved the hotel, staff was friendly, the beach breath taking the best in the Dominican.Felt like an outcast, big language barrier, 99% of the entrainment and staff are Spanish speaking. The Lion King Show was great. We did go in the middle of the summer, which was very hot, the only escape is your room with air conditioning, The showers in your room鈥r shall I say the drizzle as an excuse for a shower. The resort is open in the hot summer months, please have air conditioning in the restaurants, the food is hot, being kept warm under warm lights, the plates you put your food on is also hot, eating with sweet coming down your face is not very glamours, air conditioning would be great also in the public washrooms for that matter too. There is a big variety of food, just stay away from eggs and anything cooked in cream, even the cream in the coffee, got very sick on that. (Tim Horton coffee where are you!). Couldn鈥檛 have enough of mangos, papayas, and pineapples so juicy and sweat, the bananas so tasty didn鈥檛 give me heartburn like they do here in Canada. The fruit juices, out of this world.The tourists, please women this is a family resort, okay, so some cultures go for topless, but strings for the bottoms, if this was a couples or singles resort is one thing, this is advertised as a family resort. Then, parading like that at the beach is one thing but at the pool, please have some consideration, there are children.There really is not much to do for a 12 year old but the Internet and TV. J .All in all I would go back to this resort, in the winter months where it would be cooler and lack of air conditioning wouldn鈥檛 bother me so much, and not with my kids.Anna - Toronto

<Content>Bavaro Princess is a jewel We stayed at the Bavaro Princess -July 15-22, 2006Our flight with Air Canada was very uneventful. Just the way I like it. A slight delay on the way home (1 hour 40 minutes) not too bad.The Bavaro compared to other resorts I have stayed in was paradise. Punta Cana is paradise carved out of the jungle. The grounds at the Bavaro are well kept and lovely all the way around. I never smelled any kind of odour anywhere. It is a large resort of over 860 rooms. Sort of a bungalow style. Our room was 743 and it was literally a 30 second walk across the road to the beach and perhaps a minute to the very large free formed pool as well as the buffet and hamburger area. Remember the food is not like home. Dont go to these places thinking that you are going to get everything you are use too. It will never be that way anywhere but home. The restaurants are ok. Nothing special. Just ok.The beaches are beautiful. Our family spent many hours playing in the surf.Shopping like other caribbean areas is always an interesting experience. I look at it this way. Offer them what you want to pay if they accept it then fine if they let you walk out of the store then there will alway be the same item in another shop. Try there instead. There is not a whole lot to buy. Just the usual trinkets and an absolute ton of paintings. Who the heck paints all of these things anyway. Very Strange.The casino is a rip off. They cheat. Im sure they would never get away with this in North America. You need to know your games and I can guarantee that you will catch them cheating either yourself or other people at the tables. Never saw anyone win anything at the slots. Humm.Overall we had a great vacation and my kids did not want to come home.Enjoy

<Content>Awful!!!  Overall the facilities were ok. The rooms were nice, but where the trip went wrong was the food and service. We were there with a wedding party, and more than half the people got sick from the food. I'm dominican and the food was a disaster, they didn't cook anything good for Breakfast lunch or Dinner. The Snack place had something called a burger, but no could tell what it really was. They messed up rice  Beans, Platano Maduros (they put maple syrup in them), just awful. Then to top it all off the service was really bad. They have no professionalism, its a bunch of jokers and guys hitting on the girls in the wedding party. At checkout or Bill was incorrect and they didn't even try to fix it. They knew we had a plane to catch so they said they couldn't check us out until we paid the additional money. The phone was chanrged a collect call when we werent in the room, and prices on services chnaged after we had used them (Message was $10 more than what we were told) If the place was worth it, the additional money wouldn't have been a big deal, but since the place was awful we really didn't want to hear it. I told the manager that this experience could cost him visitors and he did not care. People stay somewhere else. A friend told us that BArcelo Resorts was much better.

<Content>A nice trip overall .... We took a quick, last minute trip to the DR and stayed at the Bavaro Princess from July 7 - 10. When I looked at this site prior to the trip, I didn't see many reviews from folks with younger kids, so I wasn't sure how my 11 and 7 year olds would like the resort. Overall, I'd say the experience was very good. It definitely helped to read the reviews on this site, since I am pretty picky about hotels (cleanliness, bugs, food, etc.). Because of the reviews (even the bad ones) I wasn't surprised by anyting I ran into on the trip. We traveled through Apple Vacations (our first time) and by the end of the trip decided we'd use Apple again. We left out ot Newark, NJ on USA 3000 and experienced a significant delay. We were scheduled for a 6:00 am flight (figured we'd sleep the entire way), but when we left for the airport and called the airline, we learned that we were delayed until 7:30. I remembered that with USA 3000, seat assignments are on a first come, first served basis, so we went to the airport anyway. The good news is we did get seats together; however, the slight was delayed further and we didn't leave Newark until 8:30. We were all exhaused since we were up since 3 am, but got some sleep at the airport and on the flight and were fine once we hit the resort.The resort was beautiful. Hot, but that was expected in July. Checking In I remembered that the check in line could be long, so while my husband dealt with the luggage, me and the kids headed for check in. This was a wise decision, because within about a minute there was a long line behind us in a very hot lobby. We asked about a courtesy upgrade to platinum, but were advised of a $30 per day/per person charge and we decided it wasn't worth it for a short trip. The RoomWe got a room (752, I think) that was a 30 second walk from the beach and main pool which was very convenient. Everything I read about the room was pretty accurate ... clean, no bugs, room key for the lights, a slight musty smell (but I was prepared with disenfecting spray and febreeze, so no big deal), the beds were very hard (but by the time we went to sleep, who cared), no washcloths in the room, but I did bring some from home. There was bottled water in the room fridge, but we did bring bottled water from home and used it to brush our teeth in the room. Also, I noticed that the water left my hands feeling a little grimy after I washed my hands so we kept hand sanitizer on hand as well.No bugs in our room - thank god - and only one little lizard on our room wall one night. There was a hummingbird that hung out near our balcony which was cool.The Food / DrinksUnless you got up very early, getting reservations was tough. As a result, we mostly ate at the buffet off the lobby or at the beach grill / buffet which was fine. The selection was good, but my kids stuck with burgers (which tasted different ??), pasta, fruit, they didn't like the pizza. We did get a late reservation at Sakura one night and found the food ok. (Note: A late reservation with kids was a bad idea, but we thought we'd give it a try.) The Apple rep told us that the water and ice in the resort was filtered, so after the first day we drank it and had no problems while at the resort. On our last night at the resort, my son experienced a stomach ache, so I'd suggest bringing Pepto Bismol or Immodium with you as I did.The BeachBeach was great. We did bring cheap beach toys in our luggage for the kids, which they enjoyed for hours. The water was clean and my kids enjoyed the waves. If you are traveling with kids, give them a heads up about the topless situation, because they will see some sights on the beach !The Pool The pool was clean and there always seemed to be activities going on for the adults. Nothing for the kids, though. There was a shallow area of the pool which the kids enjoyed.The staffThe staff was very friendly and helpful. The one thing I was surprised about is how little English was spoken by the staff. At each of the main areas (main pool bar, lobby, etc.) you could find one or two members of the staff who spoke English well, but not many. Communication was more difficult than I expected, but if you worked at it, you could get what you needed. Even speaking a little Spanish helped. The shows were introduced in Spanish too. Entertainment for Families/KidsI was not aware of any organized activities for kids at this resort. My kids did enjoy watching the Lion King performance one night and the Festival show as well, although that one was more of a variety show. Again, no big deal for us on a quick trip, but if I had stayed longer, I would have preferred a resort with some activities for kids (outside of the kids (babysitting) club during the day.Overall, the Bavarro Princess met or exceeded our expectations in every area. We would probably not go back to the DR, because there are other destinations we want to experience. Also, I will say that when we returned home, my husband and I experienced stomach issues a few days. If we did decide to return to DR, we'd consider staying at the Bavaro or maybe try the Paridisus which I hear if really nice, but more expensive. Feel free to contact me with questions and enjoy your trip ! angjohjoh@yahoo.com

<Content>Don't eat the food--Only Benefit...Lose wieght! We got sick...Basically my advise is DO NOT eat the food! After 2 days my husband and I were in the bathroom more than I would like to admit. None on the mayonasie based items were ever on ice and all of the meats were under or over cooked. Please be very picky about what you decide to ingest! Also, we were on the bottom floor of a room and the room above us was leaking the toilet water and shower water into our bathroom. We called the hotel everyday and no one came to fix it. It was gross and stinky every day. There were days that our room did not get made up either.The only thing that was good were the drinks and the beach. This was the first trip I've taken in 10 years and every night my husband and I just felt dirty. We even met some other couples down there (quite a few) who had the same issues w/ the food. Some of then, including us, threw up, got the cold chills etc. and it was not from drink the alcohol. The water will also make you sick because of the bacteria. If you even have a little cut on your leg it WILL get infected. I have a couple soars on my legs because I nicked myself from shaving and they are still infected! My hiusband and I are both going to the doctor tomorrow also because we are still having stomach problems. Next time we are going to St. Martin.....

<Content>I Cried When We Left!!! Hola!My boyfriend and I just returned from a one week stay at the Bavaro Princess in Punta Cana. July 10-17 We traveled through Apple Vacations out of Pittsburgh,PA. Our weather was not the best, but that has nothing to do with the resort so lets get on with it!BEACH::::: The beach was absolutely breathtaking! There were plenty of charis, and although we were early risers there were always open palapas until about noon! We were usually the first to arrive on the beach around 7:00am, we pulled our chairs right up to the water, and relaxed. The beach was definately the cleanest of any surrounding resorts, this was probably due to the crew of 10-15 men who collected any garbage and actually raked away the seaweed in the early morning! They deserved the extra tip!!!POOL::::: Although we spent most of our time at the beach, the pools were very clean and never very crowded, that seemed to be where the children liked to hang out.FOOD::::: The food for me only gets one thumbs up. There were a variety of restaurants that were different styles of cooking and food, however they all tasted very similar to one another. One exception was 'Licey' the gourmet restaurant. It was FABULOUS! But it is at an extra charge unless you are Platinum ( Which I HIGHLY recommend!!!) There is also a restaurant called Sekura which we were very skeptical of, it is an Asian Bistro, but it was also very very good! Our fourth day in we started being very careful of what we ate... stomach issues...FUN::::: If you decide to book under the Platinum package, a massage, cigars, a gourmet dinner, and an excursion are included (among many many other things!) Our excursion was Snorkeling, which was AWESOME! We took a 15 min. speed boat ride to a coral reef, where we had one hour in the water to swim around snap under water photos, and explore! That was worth the Platinum upgrade for me! The Casino (Where we did not have much luck...) is literally at the end of the driveway! It is a 5 minute walk or a 2 minute tram ride. We opted to walk, waiting for a tram would have taken longer, besides the grounds are beautiful and worth seeing! SHOPPING::::: We thought we did very well making deals with people, although we later decided we could have gone lower. DOn't be afraid to say ONE DOLLAR! The hotel gift shop is a joke, we asked How Much for a shot glass and were told...  For You... $25.00! Yes, TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS! However there is a small market/ shopping center just across the street form the Casino, were you can find much better deals, just be sure to examine things closely, what they say is genuine leather, is not...etc. It's all fun though!THINGS TO REMEMBER:::: You must use your room key card to operate a lock pad to use your light switches! Bring extra sunblock, we used one whole bottle of 30 SPF, and it was cloudy, we would have surely needed 2 or 3 bottles if not! This is a wonderful resort for families and children, but ran into a few singles who were very displeased.***If you are Platinum status, you have a seperate private check-in and check-out and do not have to wait in the long line at arrival. You can also make reservations for your entire stay upon arrival if you are VIP! If you travel through Apple Vacations, GO TO THE ORIENTATION!!! It is very helpful. Something I don't remember reading in any reviwes or online, was abotu the bird sanctuary! Ther eis a bird sanctuary on the gorunds of the resort! There are beautiful parrots, peacocks, doves, ducks, and many other colorful birds flying around as well as in cages and on pirches. There are bright pink flamingos just sitting in the water and none of these birds are bothered if you walk right up to take a picture! PLEASE FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME WITH ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE, I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OF THEM!dfordanielle@yahoo.comHappy Travels!

<Content>disgusting awful!auwful!and just plain awful! What they served at the restaurants didnt even come close to food. My children only ate fries and pizza, something I would never allow at home but I couldnt blamr them. The europeans are down right the rudest people I have ever met! Service stunk. We sat in Sakura for one hour before recieving an appetizer. We waited in line for a drink and if someone with a vip bracelet came up they were waited on before you even though the bartenders knew that we had been there first. I didnt know that vip at a hotel met you could but in line!!!!!!!!!! I will never go back to this hotel. The beach was georgous but much improvement is needed on service. Nothing to do for the teenagers at all after 11 pm. Ill be back to puerta vallarta and cancun first

<Content>Nice place Just got back from a week at the Princess. It is a nice place. The grounds are magnificent. The staff is unfailingly friendly. Check in and check out was a breeze. The rooms are very nice (the bathrooms are ok but don't have that big marble shower we were used to in Mexico). The balconies and patios are spacious, comfortable, and relatively private. The food is mediocre (with the exception of the grilled chicken at the beach barbecue), but you don't go to Punta Cana for the food. The nightly shows are just terrible. Be very carefull at the casino. If you are not an experienced player stay away from the table games. Either the dealers are inexperienced or they cheat. It is as simple as that. Be especially careful at the craps payouts. If you don't know the correct odds for your wins every once in awhile you will be shorted. And of course the game runs in Spanish. Finally, if you don't want to get sick don't use anything other than bottled water for everything that goes in your mouth, wash your hands constantly (hey, there are hundreds of people from all over the world there with different customs about cleanliness and sanitation not to mention the DR is a developing nation), stay away from lettuce and unpeeled fruit, and do not drink pineapple or coconut based drinks or fruit juices (they are natural laxatives). I don't want this review to sound negative. It is not. We had a great time. Presidente beer is great and it was always ICE cold at the beach bar. The beach is outstanding, much better than the surrouding resorts which if you walk the beach you will notice. The bugs are kept under control with fogging and spraying so you can walk at night and not be eaten alive like some places we've been to in Mexico and the Carolinas. Yes, there will be a bug or two in your room, but you are in a swampy jungle after all. On that note, by all means walk through the mangrove swamp raised walkway to check out the foliage, the birds, iguanas, and various other critters. One story I would like to share concerns a worker we met whlie walking thru this area. He spoke no English but approached us and offered to cut a coconut for us (I speak Spanish). What they will do is either cut the top of a coconut for you so you can drink the milk or, as this fellow did, husk the coconut down to the meat (about the size of a softball, only ellipitical) and tell you to take it to the bar where the bartender pokes two holes in it and adds your liquor of choice and inserts two straws. This is the only time I broke my no coconut juice rule and it was well worth it. From my experience I don't know where the Dominicans get the rap of being surly or arrogant. That was not my experience at all. Actually I observed other mostly Latin guests berating the staff in no uncertain terms about the most minor of inconveniences. In my travels south (a dozen times now) I have yet to see an ugly American but have seen scores of South Americans and other Latins treating hotel workers like dirt. All in all I would recommend the place, but when we return to Puna Cana we will probably try someplace different.

<Content>a very mixed review We stayed at this property with a group of thirty. The public spaces and grounds were beautiful and well kept. The cleaning and ground crews deserve well earned kudos. Our suite was also very nice. the air conditioning worked very good, and the bed was comfortable. Our only complaint with the room was the lack of wash cloths for the shower. I would suggest that anyone traveling to this resort bring along their own. The pools and beach were wonderful. The sugar white sand and clear warm waters were the highlight of our stay. Be sure to set out your beach towels early if you want a good place to enjoy the day, as they are reserved as early as seven in the morning. The food and service is another story. We ate in six of the seven restaurants. Only two of the six were air conditioned, which made for a uncomfortable dinner. The men are required to wear long pants and closed shoes to dinner in all but the buffet Hispanola. My wife and I enjoyed the restaurant Sikura the best. The service and food are excellent here. Some of the food in the buffets was downright scary. Food that should be kept cold was warm, and food that should be kept hot was warm also. Several people in our group became ill on the food. The service varied from very good to poor. I noticed that the Spanish speaking guests seemed to get the best service. Another suggestion is to brush up on your Spanish. Even the front desk staff had a very limited understanding of English. Also note that the public places like the lobby and theater are not air conditioned, and were very hot in July. We did not see many of the shows because we didn't enjoy sitting in the heat swatting mosquitoes. By the way be sure to bring along plenty of bug spray. I do not think that we will be visiting this resort again despite its beauity.

<Content>Dont delay BOOK TODAY Left from Newark on June 30th. Went to PC for 7 Nights.Flight went great. Arrival at PC airport was smooth for the most part. If you are flying with Apple you will get your entrance paperwork to fill out before you land which saves time. Once you enter you pay a $10 dollar per person entrance fee. If with Apple you get out of PC for free, included in the package.Trip to resort was about a 35/45 minute drive. The driving in PC is by far not any worse then in NYC or any other major city. Only difference is the PC area is far from a major city, so really no big deal.Once at resort they gave us a room way up in front of resort. We were not pleased and i held out a $5 bill and the person who issues your welcome package gave us a room #732 which was a short 1 minute walk to the beach and the main pool. Usualy you have to wait until around 3pm to get your room we arrived at the hotel by about 11am and i quess we were lucky cause our room was ready.The resort is as everone says, Very green lush well maintained and BIG. The trams come by very often and you can catch them fairly easily. Sadly some people wait and are first in line but when the tram comes people come out of nowhere and jump on leaving the young old and clueless wondering how they waited patently and all of a sudden they have no seat available. Advice when they come grab a seat quickly. Being nice sadly isnt on the minds of many people.The beach GREAT about the palpas its true get up early if you want one. If not worried about a palpa the lounge chairs are everywhere and never seemed to be a shortage. There is a great bar right on the beach.The pool again very BIG nice and welcoming. The is a bar in the water and one out of the water at the pool. Two great bartenders at the pool. Reuben and Gladya .Ok the food. We thought the food was fine. We tried most everything even if it didnt look all that great we figurred we would try it and if we didnt like it no big deal, we just didnt eat it. No stomach problems whatsoever.Hint the Breakfast by the beach is OK but the main Buffet up in front of the resort has a much BIGGER selection of food for Breakfast, Lunch and dinner. I wont go through a list of all the places we ate but i will say the steak hoouse we thoought was great as well as Sukura. Chopin is nice but it is just another Buffet? Bella past was just ok. Dont get the red sauce taste just like Franko american or (spagetti-Os). With that said food was just fine, a little differnt but please try new things you may be surprised.The Casino well what can i say twice they took away my money when i won. Once i had black jack a 9-3-5-4 = 21 the dealer paid a few people then scooped all the cards together and didnt pay me off. Well the pit boss was right there and i jumped up and explained but hey noone understood english so i told my wife no big deal it was a mistake. The very next hand was dealt. Im the first person to the left of the dealer and i get dealt to first. So i get my cards and the wife gets a pair of tens and splits them. Proper prcedure is for the dealer to come to me first. But he went to Karen who had split her hand. PS i was dealt a King and a three a sure hand to hit on. So he dealt karen her split and went to the next person and so on. He never came back to me once again he scooped up all the cards and i never was offerd a hit. Moral of the story GAMBLE AT OWN RISK. And i live an hour from AC i have gambled my fair share.Now the one negative which is no fault of the resort. It seems alot off the people who jump in front of the people waiting for trams also are very rude at the restaurants. Just two examples. We were getting ice cream for dessert. There was an old lady behind me so i let her get her ice cream toppings in front of me and Kare. As she was reaching to put her toppings on a man pushed through my wife then shoved the little lady out of the way to get to the fudge?? Rude yes to say the least.Next we were at chopin for dinner. A boat comes around with a piano player and singer on it. People get up to take pics as i did. I was at the waters edge by a short wall with camera up at eye to take a few pics. Next thing i know there is a lady sitting in front of my camera i say excuse me im getting rady to take a picture she tries to sho me away as her man bumps me to the side to get his own picture. Well i can only take so much so i gave him a nice shove and he asked me what my problem was??So i will not say where these people are from cause i dont want to stereotype and im sure not all of there culture are the same, but hey they are no differnt then any oter person waiting oui.Would i go back yes but i probably wont. Only because we have many other places we would like to visit.Feel free to email any questionspaul.karen@yahoo.comPs. Our maid was great we left gifts and five dollars a day and always had fresh flowers towels shaped into hearts on the bed also kissing swans. Fridge always stocked well room very clean. And please at dinner leave a little tip if possable we saw that a majority of people near us didnt tip? we always left at the minumum a few dollars. service may be a little slow at times but that doesnt mean they are not good, just trying not to sweat all over your food? Life is slower in the Dominican repulic due to the heat i would guess.

<Content>Wonderful 2 weeks Well here it goes... my review. The short version is that this was an incredible experience. The rooms were great, the grounds were spectacular, the beach was white and clean, the food was always fresh and plentiful. Very relaxing. The bad part about the trip would have to be hearing people complain about the dumbest stuff. I am embarrassed that people even think this way. How can someone complain about waiting 20 minutes for a tram to take them 800 meters? This walk only takes maybe 5 minutes. These people truly missed the idea of a resort, this isn't disneyland! It is a place to enjoy the sun, to enjoy nature, to be served and to relax. The best part about our trip was the nice walks through the rainforest, past the ponds filled with ducks, fish, flamingos, turtles, and other various beautiful birds on the way to dinner. The tram riders probably didn't even know the rainforest trails exist. We go on vacations to get away from the trams, to slow down a bit and enjoy life. This resort was a 10 for me. I would go back anytime. The 14 days of sun really helped too.

<Content>wonderful vacation My husband, my 2.5 year old son and I travelled from Toronto to Bavaro Princess from June 25 to July 2. It was our 5 time to Punta Cana. The resort was so beautiful that we fell in love with it right away. We were lucky to stay in villa 40 on the upper floor which was very close to the beach. In comparison with Grand Palladium Palace hotel and Punta Cana Princes, the room at Bavaro Princess was very cold and very spacious. You don't need to use the room key to have the a.c. running. We spent most of our mornings at the swimming pool. We noticed that even at 12 pm there were beach chairs available in the shade. My son loved the beach but especially the swimming pool. The resort was not crowded at all during our stay. The food at this hotel was the best we've experienced so far at Punta Cana. The waiters are very nice and they do their best to keep you happy. If you go to La Hyspanola, look for Jose. He speaks English and he is very friendly. My son liked him very much, and so did we. My husband tipped all the staff who was catering to us. We even gave money to the gardeners. We felt sorry for these poor hard working people who are earning only a few hundred dollars a month. The animation team was very nice. My son was selected to play in their Lion King show as Baby Simba. After that night he became very popular and everyone was calling him Baby Simba. Every night at 8pm the resort has mini disco for children. My son had a lot of fun there. He learned new dance moves. Germania, the animation girl who looks after the children at the kids club and at mini disco is very nice. Overall, the whole family had fun and we were able to relax and enjoy this vacation. We will definitely come back to this hotel in December.

<Content>An honest review We stayed at the BP from June 15-June 22. Just to say this at the beginning - I picked the BP after much research and really wanted to come back giving it a glowing review. I had been reading reviews on the hotel every day for weeks before we left and they have been very useful, so I hope the following is to you as well - even though it may not be as politically correct as others. We will give you an honest opinion of our trip (which is not a cheap option by the way as some people have suggested).I have traveled to the Caribbean and resorts in the Indian Ocean before, my partner has traveled extensively within Europe, USA and the Aegean, so we are not newbies, but our opinions differ on occasion. Neither of us are spoilt travelers. We are also probably giving you more of a British view of things.The flight from Britain is quite long - 8 hours, so arriving at the other end was a relief. There was a slight mishap with our luggage (and that of another dozen couples or so), when the band stopped, but we had still not seen any of our cases. Although no one communicated with us, the luggage was finally loaded onto the conveyor belt and we could collect it. Off we went. Our rep (with Thomson, for you UK travelers) was nowhere to be seen (and there is no Thomson desk), but after some asking around we found the correct bus. Not really what you want after a long journey.The transfer time is relatively short, just over an hour or so. When we arrived, the check-in desk sent us to the check-out desk in order to process our request for Platinum. Although there was a bit of confusion, they had picked up my request for a Platinum room (emailed the week before, very efficient) but had not picked up on the fact we wanted to book Platinum as a package, too. After many little delays, we were led to the Platinum lounge, where they finally checked us in and showed us the room.Room location was fantastic, 2 minutes from the beach (#713). The rooms are, as many people have said before, very spacious, if a little dated. The sleeping area is lovely. Some of the complimentary spirits provided in the optics were running low when we arrived. They were not to be refilled during our stay even after we had finished what was left in them. Our bathroom had a tub with shower, toilet and bidet. Sink area had lots of room for all your bathroom things. The closet was large and the rooms have a iron and ironing board. There is a coffeemaker in each room with glasses, coffee cups, powdered milk, sugar and coffee.The beach and grounds, as have been described in other reviews, are pretty great. Due to it being off season, we had a palapa every day 鈥?but you are still advised to get there and put your towel down before 7.30 am. Some people reserve them (like some American folks next to us, sorry), and then only turn up at 2pm or later. I think that鈥檚 a disgrace.The beach is lovely, but the sea bed was full of seaweed on some days. If you go up east to the flea market, be prepared for some very aggressive tactics to get you into the shops/huts and to be ripped off unless you enjoy the haggling game (we don鈥檛 really). Nothing has a price鈥?br/>The weather was lovely, apart from the last two days, when it was overcast after a thunderstorm the day before. The heat and humidity can knock your socks off.MAID SERVICE: we tipped and left a nice message and present on day 1. The net outcome was that we got 2 more bottles of Soberano beer, which is not as good as Presidente (despite asking for Presidente) and that was it. Sadly, over the next few days, the maid did less and less in the room. Washing out cups, replacing spirits, etc. was not really of concern to her. We left another generous tip and presents at the end, but not because we were impressed, it was more out of habit and because they earn so little.FOOD: The big one. Neither I nor my husband are picky eaters, so please take the following in the spirit it is intended in. After 3 days of happily eating a variety of things, both of us got sick, really sick. The rest of the holiday was a write-off. I am saying this because being sick is not just a slight distraction, it really ruins the enjoyment of your holiday, as you get very suspicious of everything, even when you feel better.HISPANIOLA: This really has the best choice and, in some ways, the best service. However, it is so hot and sticky that we found it difficult to enjoy the experience. The ceiling fans are quite pathetic and few in between.The food there, despite enthusiastic reports on this site, is mediocre. What is worse, the temperatures food is kept in are awful. Hot food is lukewarm, and cold food is tepid. There may be thermometers, but they are not set high enough. I don鈥檛 think it was this place we got sick from, but the oil/fat in which everything is cooked, reminds you of what made you ill, and I sadly remain with memories of eating potatoes and pushing the rest of my plate away, feeling sick just smelling the food on it.El Gaucho beach buffet: We ate here most mornings and lunchtimes before we fell ill. It felt much nicer eating breakfast getting a feel of the breeze, and made up for the lack of choice. The scrambled egg was lukewarm, as were the sausages and other dishes on offer. This is just not right. Hot foods should be hot, cold ones should be cold. Easy right? Not in this place. A few days at lunchtime, we enjoyed freshly made paella and barbeque, which was nice.SAKURA: The air conditioning is fierce, which is quite nice. As to the food, forget it. We came out hungry. You get 3 thin slices of sushi (well, California Roll). I asked for some more, which was ignored (greedy me). The Won Ton soup could be renamed the 鈥極ne ton soup鈥?as there was only one in the broth. My husband鈥檚 Peking duck was a leg of duck rather than the dish we get elsewhere (including China) with cucumber, pancakes, plum sauce, etc. It would have been helpful if they ad said this when ordering as we were assured it was what we wanted. CHOPIN: It was a better quality buffet than Hispaniola, but be warned: this is where I think we both became ill from. You do get things like smoked salmon, but it does not taste or smell fresh. I had a suspicion about the fresh prawns they will fry for you, but got ill despite not eating them. The musical entertainment is nice, but short, and the pianist does have problems hitting the right notes. Service was poor until I had made our presence known to the waiting staff. After that, we were very well looked after.LICEY: Nice, but nouvelle cuisine. You may be hungry afterwards. We had the pleasure of some American guest behaving only as Americans can 鈥?very loud. All guests went home feeling as though they knew them quite well, including their jobs and relationship dilemmas. I would not spend money on that restaurant. The food was nice but little of it (I know we sound greedy, but we鈥檙e not!)EL GAUCHO AT NIGHT: You will be rushed between your starter and main course. The starters were tiny. The main course was a bit of a laugh, portion-wise. The steak (nice, but fatty) was one of the smallest we had ever seen. It was accompanied by an upturned potato and no vegetables. We declined dessert, based on that experience.All in all, I am bitterly disappointed by the food and facilities. If you are Spanish or speak more than tourist Spanish, I think you may have a much better quality of holiday, as I think we paid more than some teenagers who were quite happy generating a noise level which drives holidaymakers like us away from the bar. Based on experiences from other resorts in the Caribbean, I think at the very minimum they need to invest in some Bain-maries and the like to keep food at the temperature it is intended to be eaten at. Accepting that a quota of guests get ill is just not good enough 鈥?which is why the DR is off the list of future holiday destinations. No one seemed concerned at what is not right, so we wil go to where guests are perhaps deemed a little more important.PLTINUM LOUNGE: we got this as part of paying $250 per week extra. It was nice, but perhaps they should put staff from here to the bar in the pool which constantly has bad service because there are only 2 people dealing with loads of guests. There were just too many people doing stupid things, like polishing water bottles, but use of the room was nice for sure.Sadly, this is it and my partner is left with the impression that all AI holidays in the Caribbean are like that, whic is not true - however, be careful: we both got ill and are still not o. two weeks after

<Content>Loved the bavaro princess I spent a week a the Bavaro Princess in Punta Cana from June 24 till July 1 2006. I booked with Signature Vacations which I was a little disappointed with. You fly with Skyservice which appear to be very old planes which did not help me with my phobia of flying. The service was good though. But as I got to the resort they did not have me in their computer . I asked who`s fault this was and they said it was whoever I booked it with. Anyways everything turned out well because I got a room with a jacuzzi .I also booked an excursion with Signature and again the driver did not have me on his list. Thank God I had my receipt.   Anyways I am not here to complain but to share with you my experience at this resort. First of all the Bavaro Princess is absolutely beautiful. The grounds are very well kept. My room was exactly like the pictures. Very clean and beautiful with a large balcony. What I loved the most about this hotel is the main pool. It is huge and it is absolutely beautiful. It is surrounded by palm trees. I`m sure you saw the pictures. It is breathtaking. I also enjoyed all the animals on the site. There is so much to do. The entertainment staff is awsome. My son who is 15 absolutely loved this resort.  The reason I returned to Punta Cana is for it`s beautiful beach. With it`s white soft sand and blue aqua water. There were alot of chairs on the beach but if you want one under a umbrella you need to get up at least at 8am to go reserve a chair. This should not be allowed but if you don`t do this you will never get one.  I would suggest to anyone who is planning a trip to book at this resort. You will not regret it.

<Content>Mr. Bavaro Prince This was a great vacation! The resort is beautiful and the staff is very friendly. We stayed June 22-28th and had a great time. My husband and I arrived and after checking in, we wanted to make reservations for that nights' dinner. The restaurant was booked for the night but they still made us a reservation. Sakura and Chopin were my favorite. Very romantic. Steaks at El Gaucho were delicious. We enjoyed the shows and all the great activities during the day. Water Polo was a blast and Winston, Oscar, Carlton, Cesar, Nancy and the rest of the Entertainment crew were phenominal! We won over $300 playing Craps for the first time in our lives with other vactioners. Highlight of the trip was when my husband was named Mr. Bavaro Prince out of all the men there. He was treated like royalty by all and his head is still in the clouds. From check in with Mario at the front desk to check out everything was fantastic. Your vacation is what you make it!!Banana Boat Rocks!

<Content>Better than expected After reading many reviews before our June visit, I was a bit worried. We went for my daughter's wedding and 40 guests were coming. My sister was going to celebrate her own 25th wedding anniversary there as well, on my daughter's recommendation.  I can say that we had a wonderful time. We have no complaints about this hotel. The process of getting TO the Dominican Republic was somewhat grueling for as short a trip as it was (for us, we came from Minnesota). It took us about 12 hours door to door, and because of poor timing of our intinerary (the lay overs were way too short) it was hectic and frenetic to both get there and even more so, to come back through customs. This requires claiming your bags in your FIRST US airport, then going through customs, and then re-checking your bags. Having only 1 hour and 15 minutes between planes in Miami made this just crazy-making. We finally had to be escorted by a security person past other passengers waiting at the security checkpoint unto the terminal for our next flight in order to make it on time. Not comfortable. Make sure your agent gives you some longer layovers if you are not flying direct. Anyway, back to the hotel. It's June. It was HOT. That is to be expected. Stick to the beach or pool and you'll be comfortable with occasional dips to cool off. We had no problem finding chaises in the shade and we were always able to put larger groups of our party together under several huts at both the beach and the pool. The best time to get the beach huts is very early in the morning OR go around 2 p.m. or later and they will have freed up and you can find some empty huts to sit under.  Yes, there is a mildew smell in the rooms. This is the tropics -- it's wet ALL the time and mildew happens. Expect this. Take a scented candle and burn it if you want to cover the smell but you wil not smell it after about 10 minutes in your room. Changing rooms over and over is not going to help -- mildew and the tropics just go together. Food was fine. We went to two restaurants for our pre-wedding dinner and wedding dinner-- both were good (not New York restaurant good- but fine) and the staff was very helpful in setting things up and making sure the things we needed for the wedding cake, etc. were available for us when we needed it. Otherwise, my family stuck to the buffets and that worked great for us and the food was wonderful. We all had plenty to eat. No one felt sick in our entire group. The younger people seemed to have a terrific time -- partying hardy every day and night. The older folks (dubbed the fuddy duddies) had a wonderful time turning back into kids in the pool and on the beach playing beach ball and with inner tubes. Drinks were fine--some thought a big light but most thought they were great. Most wished they had gotten the platnium package the moment they arrived BUT after one day almost every one of us said we didn't need it at all.  The salon was extremely lovely and very helpful in getting ready for the wedding.  The wedding was short, about 40 minutes late (expect that and keep guests cool if possible -- we handed out parasols to all the guests). The photos of the kids were wonderful.  All in all we were more than pleased with the entire experience. Now if the trip there and back could have been a bit less hectic it would be an A+. The hotel was great, the journey there and back, a D.

<Content>Tropical Paradise First I just have to say that the Bavaro Princess was absolutely wonderful! For anyone out there considering the Bavaro Princess for their stay and want lush grounds and a relaxing time, this hotel is for you. After all of the bad reviews we were a bit wary...but the worry was completely unnecessary. Now, if you鈥檙e interested in a more detailed description of our experience in Punta Cana and at the Bavaro Princess, keep reading.We flew out from Chicago O鈥橦are airport via USA3000 Airlines on June 17th. (Booked through Apple Vacations) Our flight was scheduled for 3:50 P.M. There was a slight delay and finally we were off. We landed in Punta Cana a bit after 10 P.M. and exited the plane right on the tarmac and headed for security and customs. The airport was empty at that hour so everything went smoothly. We found our bus easily via the Apple rep and took off for the hotel. The ride was about 30 minutes in pure air-conditioned heaven, although it was a rather crazy, bumpy ride. (And they say taxicabs in the city are crazy!)ARRIVAL - Upon arrival, we exited the bus and waited as the bellboys removed our luggage and lined up the bags along the entrance to the hotel. We were told to check in and leave our bags where they were. Once we were checked in and knew our room number we needed to give the room number to the bellboys and they would bring our luggage to the room.CHECK-IN - We had to wait in a short line, but it went rather quickly and we were the only group checking in at that time. We asked to upgrade to Platinum but it wasn鈥檛 available. (Which was okay with us) We were then given our blue ID bracelets, safe lock and key, room key, 2 towel keys, and a map of the grounds. We then returned to our bags, gave the bellboy our room number and went off in search of a drink at the Lobby Bar. We could鈥檝e taken the tram to our room but opted to walk instead.ROOM - We were in building 17 right along the main path from the lobby in room 171, which is ground floor. First, absolutely no musty smell and the room was ice cold. We had a bit of trouble with the lights but thank goodness I had read that you have to use your room key to activate the lights and as we were doing this the bellboys arrived with our luggage and assisted us with the lights. (The key does NOT have to remain in the slot) We found this on the wall across from the door. The room was extremely clean and was NOT in need of any updates in our opinion. A/C worked excellent the entire week, even turned it on low a few times because we got cold. Hubby is a hotbox and he was even chilled. The room refrigerator was also icy cold, kept our beers, sodas, and water so cold that there was even some ice build up inside of them. The patio was great, loved to sit out in the morning with my coffee, and after a long day at the beach. Oh, and by the way, no bugs whatsoever in the room. Snails and lizards stayed outside on the patio.GROUNDS - In one word I鈥檇 have to say, gorgeous! To be more descriptive, very lush, tropical foliage is found everywhere you walk and look. It鈥檚 obvious they take great pride in the grounds and keeping everything neat and clean. Lights illuminate all of the pathways and all of the buildings. Could you get lost? Sure, it takes a day or maybe even two to get to know your way around, or you can just take one of the 3 trams that continually run all day until midnight or 1 A.M. After 1 A.M. you have to call a special extension to have the tram pick you up from wherever you are. No problems there though. Some of the reviews mentioned a 鈥渟eptic/sewage smell,鈥?well, I would have to say that there IS some sort of odor down the brief walk/ride through the mangroves  foliage along the main path to/from the lobby. We believe it to be near the pumping station. The smell really wasn鈥檛 all that bad but it can take some getting used to. Some days were worse than others and it most likely originated from the mangrove swamp on both sides of the path  humidity, not sewage or septic. We have a septic system at home and when it rains hard and fast we get the septic smell. The odor we smelled on vacation was definitely not what we smell at home. TIP: If you plan on walking as much as we did, bring a very comfortable pair of sandals. The walking was definitely a good way to get a some exercise.POOL - I don鈥檛 have much to say since we only spent one afternoon at the main pool. It was clean, very big, and not too crowded. The beach bar was rather crowded but it wasn鈥檛 too bad. Besides, it was still convenient for drinks and we didn鈥檛 want to sit in the shade anyways. There were available chairs everywhere, even in the shade. The palapas were usually taken, but if you were looking for shade, there were always the palm trees to put your chair under. Some people wrote about the pool being surrounded by trees and there being too much shade over the pool. I guess it would be like that if you were swimming at 7 a.m. but during the afternnoon and until the sun begins to set around 6 p.m. the pool is in total sun. So much so that you roast. At least on the beach you don't feel the sun's heat because of the breeze. No breeze at the pool. There were lots of fun activities in the pool area from 10 A.M. until 6 P.M. for both adults and children. We watched a dance contest  water aerobics. We also saw some beach aerobics that looked like fun. (Both on sand and in the water) Other daily activities included: Tropical dance lessons  Darts Archery Stretching Petanca Table Football Beach Volleyball Beach Football Water Polo Water VolleyballBEACH - Who could possibly complain about the beach? (Unless you hate sand of course.) It is absolutely gorgeous and the cleanest one we saw up and down in both directions. The small amounts of seaweed don't begin to collect until late afternoon and even that isn't bad compared to the other resorts nearby. Sometimes it gathers in the surf near the shore but it isn't bad at all. We took the KONTIKI BOAT TOUR one day and noticed that the beaches there had lots of seaweed along their shores, particularily near the Ocean Bavaro Resort where the Tour's base of operations is located near. The water is beautiful and warm. You can't go wrong lying on the beach with a cocktail, listening to the gentle pounding of the surf and soaking up the sun. SIDENOTE: A lot of topless women on the beach in all shapes and sizes. Didn't bother us, but if you aren't comfortable with it just be forewarned.CHAIRS- As we didn鈥檛 venture out of our room until 11 a.m. or noon, we thought we might have a problem finding chairs on the beach. (From everything I read on TA) Well, that worry was also put to rest. We had not one problem finding 2 empty chairs every single day. Again, the palapas were usually taken by this time, but there was always shade available under the many palm trees and there were empty chairs everywhere. Never did we see anyone reserving chairs the night before either as we enjoyed late nights on the beach with our cocktails. Even as we walked down the beach in both directions most of the resorts had plenty of chairs, yet the beaches and water were crowded with people.TOWELS - Same goes for towels. Heard all these horror stories about how there aren鈥檛 enough towels if you go late in the afternoon and such. No matter what time we went there were always stacks of towels available. We exchanged ours once at 3 P.M. because they were really wet and we didn鈥檛 have any problems. TIP: Don't forget your towel cards!BUGS - Hardly any, even flies. People wrote about flies on food , etc. I personally didn鈥檛 see any. I鈥檓 sure there may have been a few but flies love outdoor BBQ鈥檚 back home and that never stopped me from eating outdoors before. If you can sit back and say you have NEVER encountered flies on food while eating outdoors, whether it be on the food set out or on your plate, then you鈥檝e never been on a picnic or to a backyard BBQ. Mosquitoes? Sure, I got 4 or 5 bites over the course of a week without having ANY bug spray on, can鈥檛 say that鈥檚 bad at all. Back home I鈥檇 be covered in bites without any bug spray on. I would recommend spraying ankles, lower legs when going to dinner because that鈥檚 where it seemed like I had gotten bitten. No bites from sand fleas or, 鈥渘o-see-ums,鈥?either.WILDLIFE - Plenty of peacocks, ducks, flamingoes, small lizards roam the grounds freely. There is also what they call an, 鈥渆cological walk,鈥?or, 鈥渕ini-zoo.鈥?There you can find a hawk, iguanas, cockatiels, and other birds. We even managed to see a few stray cats on the beach late at night and a few frogs. DISCO - Great. Pretty empty early in the evening, but gets a bit busier after the lobby bars close. It鈥檚 open from 11:30 p.m. until 2:30 a.m. Located inside the casino.CASINO - Biggest one around  has $5 blackjack tables. Great service, great drinks and not too crowded. Open from 7 p.m. until 5 a.m.FOOD - We only went to La Hispaniola..the nightly buffet, El Gaucho, Chopin, and sampled the late night snacks at Bella Pasta. El Gaucho was the A la Carte restaurant and was excellent. It is located right near the beach and if you get the right seating you get the ocean breeze during dinner. We ate at La Hispaniola nearly every night except two and the food was pretty good. There is a decent variety and we always found something to our liking. Lunch we usually ate a hamburger or hotdog from the McPrincess Grill located right off the beach. Hubby did try the lunch buffet from El Gaucho and that was pretty good also. We loved the deep fried sweet potatoes. The nice thing about the McPrincess Grill and El Gaucho鈥檚 lunch buffet is that you can make yourself a plate and eat in right on the beach if you choose. EL GAUCHO - This is an a la carte restaurant for dinner. Reservations are needed and pants are required for dinner. The food was excellent. We both had the Argentenian steak dinner and enjoyed every bite. Service was also good. CHOPIN - We absolutely loved dining at Chopin. We had a truly awesome server named Benito. It was a buffet dinner, but the food was tasty and there was a wide variety of selections. Benito was truly on top of everything. Making sure our table was clean of dishes, our water and champagne refilled and he even took the time to teach us a few spanish words. For anyone looking for a truly romantic dinner, try Chopin, you can鈥檛 go wrong. (And reservations aren鈥檛 usually all booked up like the other restaurants).If there was anything negative at all to say about our experience were making dinner reservations. We got conflicting information from our Apple Reps about when we could make the reservations and always seemed to just miss out on the times. That was okay though, we got to eat where we wanted to eat and the days we wanted so it all worked out. However, if you are the type of person that is highly organized, you might find yourself a bit frustrated with the whole reservation thing.On a side note concerning the food. It was mentioned the food was soggy, or not kept at the right temperature. Every food item at this resort was kept on temperature controlled units. Never did we see ice that was completely melted under the food. The food was constantly being replenished whether the dish was empty or not. I had salad every single day of my stay and it was always cold and crisp. In my opinion the food preparation was more sanitary than back home. By the way, neither hubby nor I got sick. Hubby had a bit of a stomach issue after a night of heavy drinking and eating but that was his own fault. ;-)TIP: The food is not like what you would eat at home, but it's good. Just be aware that you are in a different country and therefore the food is prepared differently.BARS - No complaints here on that one, but I don鈥檛 think too many people would complain. Plenty of liquor, whether you were platinum or not. All of the bartenders were friendly and hardworking. For those who complained about having to wait for your drink, well of course. Don鈥檛 you have to wait when you鈥檙e at home? The bartenders at home have more than one customer to wait on. Would it be any different on vacation? Nope. Patience. It鈥檚 hot and humid and these poor guys are busting their butts behind the bar in long sleeve shirts and vests! Give them a break. It鈥檚 not like they look at you and ignore you. Relax!TIP: Look for Reynaldo (and Adolpho) at the 24 hour McPrincess Bar. He's there after midnight and made our vacation wonderful. We even exchanged addresses as he has a 5 year old son I'll be sending things to.EXCURSIONS - We only did 2 excursions. The first one was the Kontiki Tour. I had booked this trip online the day before our departure. On our first day in the DR we went and spoke with our Apple Reps to ask about the Tour and find out where they would pick us up. I gave them my confirmation email and they were a bit confused by it and asked who I had booked it through. I oculdn't remember the company but I knew it was right through the Kontiki website. Anyways, they made a phone call but couldn't get a hold of aanyone and told us to stop back in a bit. We then went to another tour operator with Rancho Xtreme inquiring about what trips they offered. We met this very helpful rep and ended up booking a dune buggy/ATV Tour for Wednesday. ($100 USD for 2 Adults) Anyways, we told him about the Kontiki tour I had booked online. I gave him the confirmation paper and he quickly made a phone call. He said everything was confirmed and the tour bus would pick us up in front at 1:00 pm the following day. We arrived at 12:30 just to be on the safe side and proceeded to wait. The operator saw us waiting and said that sometimes the tour bus is a bit late having to pick up other passengers at other resorts. 1:00 pm came and went and Will (the tour operator) saw us still waiting and came over to us. He told us he would make some phone calls since no one had arrived to pick us up. To make a long story short, the bus did come, stopped briefly, didn't exit his vehicle, and took off less than a minute later. We didn't know what was going on and neither did Will. He thought the driver would return. When we saw that he wasn't coming back, my husband ended up going to the front desk, telling them what had happened, called the tour company and told them the situation. They couldn't locate their driver who was supposed to pick us up so the hotel arranged for us to picked up by cab. I was so grateful for their help. So we take a short cab ride to the tour and the tour company took care of the cab driver's fare. The tour boat was just being loaded up and we were the last to arrive. Glad that the fiasco of getting there was over we were ready to party. All in all the tour was awesome, rain and all. Any questions, just email me.The 2nd tour we did was the ATV/dune buggy tour. A GREAT experience. We drove our own dune buggy (along with 3 other dune buggys and about 20 ATV's) through some local villages, stopped off at a local home where they harvested their own coffee, went through some massive mud puddles, got soaked, and ended up at a beautiful stretch of calm beach. There you had the opportunity to purchase some local fruit from children, few souvenirs, take a swim to clean off or relax, and sit back with a cold beer or beverage. We were then supposed to head back, however, due to some irresponsible kids on our tour, we were delayed and instead of getting back to our hotel at 3:30 pm, we got back around 6:30 pm. (Not the tour's fault obviously) Anyways, it was a great way to spend $100! TIP: If you go on a similiar excursion, decide to take the dune buggy and go through the water, pack some dry clothes in a ziploc bag because you will be completely soaked! If you aren't as adventurous, you will only get a bit muddy.SHOPPING: Right across from the hotel is a small shopping plaza. We ventured there on one of our first days and they are brutal, however, we love to haggle as my husband sells cars for a living. We didn't buy much that first day and were glad we didn't. We waited until Thursday night when the hotel brings in a few reputable local vendors to sell their wares. We bought a few bracelets from a man named, Armado, and he begged us to come to his shop the following day located at Plaza Bavaro, a market down the street from the hotel. We walked down the beach past 2 other resorts to get to the plaza. Long, hot walk. If you aren't up for the long walk, take a taxi, it's not far and won't cost much. The plaza is large and the vendors are very aggressive but we kept repeating that we were looking for Armado. His little shop is named Ovines. If you get a chance, stop there, he will give you an amazing deal on souvenirs. We finally located his shop and he clearly recognized us. We browsed his small shop for over an hour and ended up buying several T-shirts, a handmade purse, and many other items for a flat $100 USD. He then asked us to stop and have a beer with him at the bar located in the middle of the market. We sat with him there talking with him for over an hour and 2 beers. He was so friendly, even taking the time to write down some spanish phrases for us and telling us about his family. There's not a doubt in my mind that when we return to the DR we will be looking up Armado. In the end, we met so many wonderful Dominican people on our trip and learned so much. We definitely plan on going back and will most likely stay at the Bavaro Princess again. My main bit of advice would be to remember you are on vacation and are there to relax and enjoy. You are away from home and daily life and should just sit back and enjoy. Go with the Dominican flow!

<Content>Excellent Resort! I just took a week-long vacation to Bavaro Princess with my boyfriend, and another couple. After checking out all of the reviews on Tripadvisor, I was curious to see what we would encounter. I do not understand how anyone could say this resort is less than good or great. As long as you do your research (ie - knowing that the men need long pants at the reservation restaurants - come on people. if you're going to a different country, you have to do your homework. That's your own fault if you don't read up.), you will have a great time. The food was pretty good - a little different from American, but I can say that I was always filled up by the meals - and I cant complain too much because I dindt go there for the food. Breakfasts were great at La Hispaniola. Our waitress sent us off with 6 pounds of Dominican coffee the day we left. The staff was wonderful. They worked their butts off, and accomodated our every need. We did tip the workers quite often, but we all said they deserved it for the quality of service they provided. We enjoyed the nightly entertainment at the resort, and had a good time at the casino as well. If you want to go shopping just outside the resort, do your research! It was clear that the shop owners took advantage our American tourist status. The drinks at the bar were always good - enjoyed trying out all of the tropical concoctions. Our faves were the Coco Loco, margaritas, and the Presidente beers were good too. As far as excursions, we did the 1/2 day snorkeling trip. Definitely the highlight of the trip. We had a blast - swam with awesome fish, huge sting rays, and sharks bigger than all of us. We also had a Coco Loco cooking lesson, merengue dancing, and drinks/snacks/lunch. Well worth the additional $$. Weather was pretty good. We had 1 day of downpours, about 3 cloudy days, and 2 hot, sunny days. At the time, the clouds were a little disapointing, but looking back, we were lucky not to be under the intensity of the Caribbean sun for a week. We definitely would have come back with nasty sunburns. I would recommend this resort to anyone. I have never had such a relaxing vacation, and would definitely go back - probably for a longer stay.

<Content>Sick Experience We just arrived from the Bavaro Princess where 34 family members celebrated my daughter's wedding. The hotel is lovely but we were never told that many of the restaurants and bars are not air conditioned and the ones that are are still very warm. Most of us got sick with stomach ailments and my son came home with strep throat. I also found that the weddinng coordinater was quite rude and unaccommodating. I would never go back there and I wish we would have stayed here in our lovely state. It is not necessary to travel that far considering that we too have gorgeous beaches. Happy In Florida

<Content>Paradise I am at a total loss as to why people were so disapointed with this hotel. The accomadation is fantastic and the grounds and beach are stunning. Ok the food was not the best, I would say 3 star, but only fatties go on holiday for the food and there was more than enough choice so we never went hungry. As for the staff they are the nicest people I have ever met, they did not stop smiling for the whole 2 weeks we were there. All you people who said they were rude and inconsiderate may want to think about the way you treated the staff because i certainly found that if you were rude to them, they won't provide the service you want. Me and my girlfriend were treated like Royalty by the staff because we didn't treat them as our slaves and always had manners which i think they appreciated. The weather was fantastic for the whole trip so don't be misled by internet weather channels which say the weather is cloudy and rainy this time of year. We had 30 minutes of rain all 2 weeks and the few odd days of cloud but the sun was still shining. One down side was the Spanish tourists, they thought they owned the resort and every English speaking person i met out there agreed that the Spanish tourists were [--] . That was the only down side but all in all the place is PARADISE and you would not be disappointed. Go There !!!

<Content>just got back We just got back last night (at 4am). All the reviews we have read are pretty accurate so we thought we would write our own.once you arrive, your on your own... so just leave your bags with the men that take them off the bus for you. Check in. You receive a tag that includes your room number to put on your bag. then i suggest you grab some drinks from the bar before heading off to your room... your bags will arrive momentarily. It was very hot and humid our entire stay so dont say you wern't warned. you need to get up early to get a reservation at el goucho or sekura. i managed to snag a table at el goucho once and never at sekura because I never made it to the reservation table before 10 a.m. bella pasta was nice al la carte but my favourite was chopin. A decent buffet and they cooked your pasta with your choice of ingredients right in front of you. the piano and singer on a baot after 8:30 was nice touch too. We never got sick. Dont drink the tap water. The shopping just outside the resort was very differnt. the second you leave the resort, someone will pull you into his shop and harrase you to buy something and everything. so have fun with that. the nightly shows starting around 9:30 are pretty fun so try not to miss that. i tipped a maid five dollars one day and she made us a goose (out of towels of course). i never tipped her the next day and she simply left the towels on our bed. the beach was very nice and picturesque but there was a quite a bit of seeweed on a couple of days. the tour that lets you drive a speed boat and snorkle was a lot of fun. No one mentions this but there is a large market at the boat launch, so bring some money if you want to shop. the vendors are not as aggressive there. overall its a great place to vacation. have fun.

<Content>AWESOMEEEE VACATION!!!! Everything from the start was Excellent! From reading all the previous reviews, I knew that the Platinum check-in was in a different location, so right off the bat i asked where it was. We got a ride to it and was checked in in about 5 minutes. They spoke good english at the desk too! Everything was explained very good too us. Our room was right across from the loung, which was nice and about a 5 min or less walk from the beach and pool. We did catch the trams up to the front. We only walked it once..t is a pretty good walk too.. BRING comfortable shoes!! BEACH- was awesome as usual, we were up brioght and early everyday at 7am and always had a chair and palapa. I saw chairs and palapas open till about 10 am . It wasnt too crouded when we were there, but didnt see alot of people up too early. I think we were the first out every morning! POOL- was gorgeous. Always kept it clean, with a few occasional leaves....there are trees around it! The swim up bar was awesome.. Ruben is the man... Lots of rum...hmmmmThe pool-side activities were fun to watch too, or participate in. We did a few of them, then we were dragged into a few of them..from the hotties that do them. ROOM- looks just like the picture...it was a little musty smelling, but you got used to it, not alot they can do about it, with all the condensation and everything else. The air and fan worked fine. Iy was always cool. The shower seemed fine to us. I didnt even try to take a hot shower..i was too hot from the day beforehand! We had one little gecko in our room..but hey..your in the carribean..besides they are harmless.RESTAURANTS-HISPANIOLA- this buffet was awesome, we ate here the first night. The service was great along with the food. Soem food was not too hot, but still good. Not everything can be kept steaming hot! Everything was replanished as it dissapeared. Breakfast was very good here too.. Omelletes were awesome.BELLA PASTA- This was probably the least favorite...The food was good, but could of been better. The spaghetti was more like the spaghetti from Chef Boyardee(the meatball was good though). The minestrone soup had about 2 vegatables in it! All brroth.LICEY- The food was great in this restaurant as well.. The air conditioning was more like Hot Air. The appetizer and salad was quite small, but good. I heard of one family that got sick from here, we ate the same thignand didnt get sick. So im not sure what happened.CHOPIN- buffet was awesome, seafood too! We had a 8:00 reservation and ate then left. We were getting eaten up by the mosquitos, so we never seen the boat go areound..we left too soon.EL GAUCHO- Breakfast was good, always fresh fruit and different choices. The lunch buffet was very good too..more like a dinner buffet though..n=very filling foods..but hey, its vacation, might as well eat. Didnt eat here at night, didnt have that extrra day. But heard from a few that the steak was amazing. And if you wasn filet mignon..ask for it,(not on the menu, but they have it)EL PESCADOR- The lobster was awesomeeeeeee. Shrimp cocktial couldnt have been any smaller, but all was very good! Service included!SAKURA- beautiful restaurant. The food was also very good at this one! The mimosa was great too. Although, the wonton soup...You dont get a wonton in it..ita all broth. We found that most of every places soup is nothing but broth. The duck was awesome. My friend had the grouper, which she said was yummy too. MAC PRINCESS- BEST hamburger i have had in a long time! The deep fried hot dogs are different, but good. FYI, this is the only place that has REAL ketchup. (its in the little packets) So if you forget to bring some....stock up on them while this place is open. We took lots to our romm so we had them in the morning and the rest of our trip. You cant get them after its closed up or in the morning for eggs...for those of you who like it on t hem...I do!Neither one of us ever got sick or a stomach ache, i even brought all the medicine in the owrl. I do believe we were on the toilet more than usual, but never sick! (sorry, had to say it)FYI- If you do the platinum, you do have to ask for Budweiser...they keep it in the back...and if you drink alot of it...they may tell you they have none or that its warm. just tell them to give you a warm one...it will be cold...I dont know if they just dont want us drinking it or what, but they tried getitng around it, and i wasnt having it. I need by BUD!The trams get real busy arounf dinner time...so either go early or wait a longggg time or walk. Some places arent a bad walk, depending on where you are. Other than that the trams were great, besides the pushy people fighting over the seats,...u gotta run for them! Any other questions, feel free to email me... jalenpatrick1225@yahoo.comOVERALL, I would DEFINETELY go back to this resort!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Great Resort I recently visited with a co-worker for a girl trip. We had a great time. We did our homework before the trip, read reviews  we were ready for whatever came along. We DID NOT upgrade  we still had superior service. Never waited for a drink  always had fast, friendly service, all with no tipping. By doing our homework, we knew that we had to bring our own washcloths....no big deal. The grounds were perfect. The only problem I can say that we had was on the morning we were to leave, the shuttle service was running behind. The food was different, but I wouldn't consider it bad. You have to remember this is a third world country  these people work hard for the little money they get. We didn't get sick because we were smart enough to remember that too much sun, surf  alcohol do not mix. The vendors on the beach are VERY persistant. We probably would have purchased more, but we got tired of being harassed. All in all, it was a great resort that I'm recommending to anyone that asks.

<Content>Just returned from Bavaro Princess A+++ Just returned from the Bavaro Princess and we had a wonderful time!! So here goes:The flight out of Chicago was with USA 3000 a nice flight, very crowded, but ok. We arrived at Punta Cana airport, very nice ans safe, but very hot. But what do you expect. There was not much of a wait for luggage. We went out after customs and there were porters trying to take your luggage to the bus, we just said No Grasias and they were fine. The trip to the hotel about 35 minutes. Now the hotel WOW absolutely beautiful the landscaping was unbelieveable. Flowers of all kinds blooming all over, breathtaking. When we checked in we asked to upgrade to Platinum and it was available. $30 per person per day extra. They escorted us to the Platinum lounge were we were treated like kings and queens and given moist towels to freshen up with. Platinum Lounge: Allowed you free internet access off of 2 computers, free champagne (as much as you want all day long), continental breakfast, light lunch, coffee, restaurant bookings without waiting in long morning lines also you can go to any ala carte restaurants as many times as you want except for Licey, free 30 minute massage and free snorkeling per person. The lounge was also a nice relaxing place before dinner for cocktails and a nice place to catch the tram. We were given a different bracelet for the week and this gave us different liquors at the bars, such as instead of draft beer they would open a bottle of Presidente and pour it into a cup. We feel as did others that we were treated differently in all areas of the resort. Staff was very very accommodating. Great demeaner. Room: We were in 728 and 764. They were a stones through away from the beach. No smell. Water pressure was ok. King size bed and we had one extra bed brought in my kids room. All 18 and over. We tipped a couple of dollars each day and then to the night time maid too. A key had to be kept in the slot n order for the electricity to run. No problem we had two keys anyway. The balcony was great two lounge andirondack chairs. Also free room service until 11:00pm (Platinum) Frig stocked 2 times during the day. Fresh towels 2 times a day.Drinks: All of the bars have top shelf liquor and you have to ask for it. Once you do they will remember what you drink the entire time. They do not have real orange juice and their grenadeen is VERY sweet. If fact most of their mixed drinks are sweet. I preferred the Cuervo and Lemonade, it was awesome. Do bring your big mugs to the swim-up and beach bar. The plastic cups are very small. Type of liquor, I tried to memorize, Vodka: Smirnoff, Absolute, Stoli Tequila: Cuervo Gold and Silver Whiskey: Jim Beam SCotch: JBGin: Tangueray, Beefeaters, and Seagrams. Also in the lounge bar and the El Gaucho Bar in the evening they have Kahlua and Baileys. But do forget to ask for it.Restaurants: El Pescadoer: Awesome seafood, we went there 2 times. Bella Pasta: Aweful, don't go, not worth it. Sakura: VEry good, went there 2 times. Licey (All-inclusive with platinum) Very nice VEry romantic Beautiful!! We had breakfast at the lobby bufett one time, they close by 10:00am and reopen for lunch at 1:00pm. Too earlly for us to get there. Beach buffett was open until 11:00am and they also serve lunch. Very good. El Gaucho: Very good but no air conditioning. all in all the food was exceptional. Lot and Lots of Lobster!! We also went to a Casa del Mar on the beach. It was $72 per person all-inclusive with your choice of bottled wine. This restaurant is directly on the beach and is probably the most romantic restaurant that I have ever been to. You can stay there all nite and drink until 2:00am if that is what you wanted to do. They have beds that are on the beach that you can relax on. Suggestion, do not eat all day, because there is so much food. Excellent!!Pool: Very relaxing but fun to. WE did a little of both, volleyball, water polo, swim up bar...Beach: WOW, very beautiful. We brought rafts so we floated all day. Very clean. Parasail, snorkel, Hobie Cats, windsurf, etc.Weather: Warm we were in the water pretty much all day long. I am an avid tanner and I used 15 the whole time. Got a really nice tan.Tram: The tram holds about 16-22 people and take you all over the resort. The tram stops running at 12:00midnite. Casino: Great time. They had a lot of tables, black jack minimum bet was $5. Lots of slots too and that is where the disco Lancelot is at. When you go to the casino take the tram to the lobby and then walk to the front of the lobby and take a casino tram. On the way back do the same if it is after 12:00midnite the casino tram will take you to your room. We tipped $1 per person.Entertainment: Didn't do too much except for casino. Very exhausted after all day fun and sun.Calling card: You can buy a calling card for $10 for 16 minutes across the street at the pharmacy. The phone is out there as well. If you use a calling card in the resort you will be charged something...NO LANGUAGE BARRIER AT ALL. EVERYONE TREATED YOU LIKE YOU WERE SPECIAL!!Check out no problem. Punta Airport, long line, very hot, try to get to the airport 3 hours before you leave, we were there late because we had to wait for people to get on the bus at our resort so we were behind 30 minutes. WE were almost the last to check in and our seats home were all over the place. Once again nice flight home.I rate this resort a 5+++, it fulfilled all of our needs for the week. CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!!

<Content>What A Nightmare Let me just start out by saying what a beautiful place but, needs extreme help in the food and service dept. We book a family vacation every year. My brothers, sister and all our kids go. There is 15 in total. We are from Miami and have been to other all inclusive resorts and I will never return to this one. Your food is included but, you must make reservations ahead of time. You cannot get a reservation in the restaraunt that you want to eat in that night and we found out that you cannot get into the restaraunts without the men wearing long pants and a collared shirt. All of the guys in our group did not bring long pants but, nice linen shorts and they were not allowed in. The only solution was to wear the staff/worker pants to dinner that did not fit. It looked riduculous but, we did not want to eat at the hot outside buffet every night. Mind you, the women can wear anything. Our air conditioner, toilet, refrigerator did not work properly. The room is nice but, needs help. If you want service, you must tip the employees or you sit there without drinks, etc. We did not know about the upgrade, it's worth it. All our kids got sick and there was only 1 bottle of pepto available at the store. Bring plenty of suntan lotion, it's approx. $25. 00 a bottle and chips are expensive also. The pool and beach are nice and the entertainment team is great. We were told not to leave the resort and there is nothing inside the a/c to do at night. Everything is outside and really hot. I am from Miami, but, there is usually a/c to run to. Our rooms were on the other end of the hotel and had to take a shuttle which takes about 20 minutes to catch a ride. They are always full. I just wanted to tell everyone that this place is not worth the money and you will leave hungry and most likely sick. Sincerely, L. Contessa, Miami, Fl.

<Content>The Place Beautiful..All Else Stunk....Not Customer Friendly From the get go, we had problems. We had a party of 14 family members. We are from Miami, and know the heat, none of us packed slacks(mind you we all packed nice expensive dress outfits).No where on any paperwork or Internet does it specify this. The men were required to wear slacks everynight for reservations we had to trek to the Main Lobby to make everynight. (half the time they were all booked anyway) and we had for our $3000 stay eat at a buffet in what seemed like 95 degree heat.....They offered the men the option to wear the service trousers, to eat. Now you tell me, which looks better high waters (the men were 6 foot and up) and dress shirts. Or make some kind of exception for dress shorts and shirts. No exceptions were to be made. Our men wore the blue polyester service trousers and some kind of dress shirt to the 3 places we were able to make reservations at. We will never, ever go to this place again. The excursions were also a joke...The Lobby Staff were not friendly and was there way or the highway. We were stuck....

<Content>Awesome Place for the all family We went there for the first week of June which is probably the last week off season. Never had a problem to find a place on the beach or the pool. I can see how frustrating that could be if you have to be there very early in the morning to find a place to stay which was not our case. You, for sure, want shade as the Sun can be very strong. Bring CREAM !! After all you are in the caraibbe.First, I would like to say that everything is just almost to perfection. They are the nicest people I have come close to in a long time. They work very hard and always try to help you. Now I do speack spanish and that probably help. It's a safe resort to be in and the food is good, nothing crazy but if you like Lobsters, you will for sure find yourself picking them of the grill many times.Wish the excursions were a little less expensive but we did the half day snorkling as well as the horse back riding on the beach. This was just amazing and spectacular.You do not feel like you have to live any tips but they deserve them, even more since it makes no difference in their attitude and service if you leave none. I always left a dollar on the pillow for the cleaning lady and tips at the bar many times. They always took a very good care of my childrens when going by themself to get a drink. Everybody was so friendly that I'm just amazed and want to go back. Now I will make sure to be there off season as when we left, people were just rushing in the resort and the beach was looking very crowded.For the bad comments that you can read about the resort, I can see how you can get an upset stomack, there and anywhere in the world for that matter since it takes time to adjust. Resort has nothing to do with it. All was really clean and good. Also the crowded beach in pick season can be a turn down sometimes, and I can see why if you are with little childrens when you have to walk to find a space. But for us, we will get there and find a spot in a minute. The beach is exceptional. The swimming pool is exceptional. The people are exceptional.We had a chance to drive into different resort when picking people up for excursions and I can safely say that Bavaro Princess seems to be one of the nicest.I hope this help and you enjoy your trip.Also when you get in, like in Canada, you have to pay $10 tourist fee but for us in the US, we do not pay anything coming back. They also like dollars and you can pay everything with them. You will be better off to bring more dollars than you need than doind deals in pesos. You negociate everything you buy !!! Dollars helps in your favor.

<Content>amazing vacation I have to agree with all of the recent positive reviews. looks like may is the time of year to go to the Bavaro Princess! we were there may 21-28.Beach and PoolI am an early riser (up at 6:30 every morning!) so we had no problem getting a palapa. There were always empty chairs on the beach, and we did share our palapa with others (4 can fit comfortably under the midday sun. there were 6 of us, so we used 1 1/2). The beach is the best on the stretch- none of the other resorts had as many people enjoying the beach. in fact, many resorts, especially those to the left, had no one on the beach! It did bother me that many people leave their trash- particularly cigarette butts- in the sand around the palapas. We were on the beach from 9:30 to 3 everyday, after which we'd head over to the pool for an hour or two. it worked out well, because at that time of day, there were shady areas in the pool, and by then we needed it. RoomsVery clean, nice, and big. Dated? Probably. But the decor was the same as other resorts i have been to, so i guess that's normal. We had warm water/ good pressure for most of our showers. didn't miss it the times it wasn't there. i LOVE scalding showers at home, but there i needed to cool my body off anyways. I was in building 80, located towards the back of the plaitnum section. We were there because we had requested being as close as possible to the others in our group who weren't platinum. We also requested king beds. all of our requests were met. By the way, they are currently renovating buildings. while we were there they were working on 81 and 79. i guess the noise might have bothered me if we were there midday. i only knew they were there because sometimes they were finishing up when we returned from the pool. FoodNo one got sick, and we all found food we enjoyed. There was a vegetarian in the group, who had plenty to eat. The person in my group with a weak stomach did not have one issue. We ate/ tried everything and avoided nothing. I do have to note that we all took acidophilus previous to going, and continued there. BIG help. even the normal problems associated with traveling, eating and drinking so much were avoided. So many restaurants, i didn't make it to Sakura or Bella Pasta. Saturday was seafood night at the buffet. At pescador, i did not care for the lobster with a sauce- forgot the name- (order the grilled instead). Chopin was yummy. Gaucho was good (great argentinian steak). Licey was delicious. Others in my group loved Bella Pasta, and were not too impressed with Sakura. Drinks- lots to drink. we avoided any red drink because the syrup used was sweeter than we like. loved the caipirina and had many a margarita. you ask for stronger or smoother drinks. Also cocolocos, tainas, blue skys, cuba libres. Platinum vs Non-platinumMy husband and i were platinum, 2 other couples with us were not. Here's a run down of the differences- you decide if the perks are worth it for you. Rooms- same size, locations were close together (as we requested). Platinum received 3 cigars each. Platinum also received a robe and slippers to use for the week. We got a beach bag to keep. Platinum had liquor bottles in the room. Platinum also recieved nicer toiletries. ReservationsVery convenient when platinum. But since we were there at a quieter time, the others didn't encounter difficulties. but we were also up early each day. I was able to make group reservations for all of us, as long as i didn't tell them that others in the group weren't platinum. We really did enjoy Licey- both the food and the environment. For nonplatinum it would have cost $30 extra. Platinum Lounge- available to platinum customers. I found this to be very convenient. 2 computers for free internet access. Nonplatinum needs to pay a fee to use the computers in the lobby. Nice to have the coffee, cold beverages, snacks at the lounge. Drinks- they say better brands are available. i enjoyed the regular stuff, so i can't say the difference. Check Out- faster and easier with platinum. wasn't too bad for the others, but i did see times when there was a long line at check out. Things to bring- bug stuff (a few bites), cold medication (common to catch colds after flying!), a raft for the pool or beach (i got one cheap at Walmart and left it there), a ball for the ocean (too windy for a beach ball), themal cup for drinks, antifungal cream (got athlete's foot from the pool), and twice as much sunscreen and aloe as you think you will need. i have much more to tell, but since the reviews have been so good and reflect my experiences, i won't go on. if you have any questions, reply to a forum i've participated in (shortykcj), and i'll respond. By the way- the weather was fantastic. hot and sunny. i think there was a total of 5 minutes when a passing cloud obscured the sun. we often saw clouds building inland, but they never made it to the coast. it was HOT and HUMID. too hot to do any excursions. we were content sitting in the cool breeze on the beach.

<Author>FunVacation
<Content>Great Resort..No Problems At All... We stayed at this resort from 5/10 - 5/16. We were worried due to the bad reviews. The resort was great...no problems at all. There is a language problem...but you're in their country so you should expect to them to speak their language...a little Spanish gets you a warm response and a smile. We would recommend this resort....friendly, helpful employees, good food and service (except Chopin..lousy food and lousy service)....other restaurants great food and great service.....main buffet ok food - great service. We ate salad, seafood...a variety of foods and neither of us got sick at all....Beautiful grounds, clean room..white sand beach..the ocean was cloudy and 2 out of the 6 days it had quite a bit of seaweed...don't know why I was told that the water is usually crystal clear. You get in return what you give out....treat people with respect and they'll return it to you.....Thanks again to the staff at the Bavaro Princess for the great vacation.....Special thanks to Domingo and Milton!!From Boston............

<Content>Bavaro Princess A True Paradise! Hola' my husband and I along with my son and his fiancee just returned from 1 week a/i from Bavaro Princess what can I say about this hotel, it is absolutely fantastic, from what I've noticed the staff does an excellent job making sure that people have a good time, we had a great time, lots of sunshine and blue water, yet it's true that if you need a palapa you need to get up early in the morning and reserve one, by 8:00 am they were all taken and believe me you do need one.ROOMS: Our suite was spacious and very clean, our maid was great, she gave us fresh towels everyday, replenished our mini-fridge daily, fresh flowers, etc.... I gladly tipped her everyday as these people work very hard and they are happy whatever you give them.GROUNDS: Absolutely gorgeous! Everywhere you looked everything was manicured to perfection, flowered trees, coconut palm trees, and birds singing....paradise!FOOD: A wide variey to choose from (even for picky eaters like me) we ate at La Hispaniola, El Gaucho, El Pescador, and Bella Pasta, good french-fries at MacPrincess and none of us got sick (I think the people who gets sick are the ones who stuff themselves and drink too much).ENTERTAINMENT: The animation staff was excellent, every night a different show, the best was the Lion King, these people not only they entertain you, but they also work at the resort where they are needed, they do work long hours and they deserve a big applause!OVERALL we had a great time, a special thank you to Antonio at check-in for changing our suites right-away, we have no doubts returning to BAVARO PRINCESS!HASTA LUEGO!

<Content>Great vacation!  My sisters  their husbands and I returned from an absolutely fabulous Mother's Day week at the Bavaro Princess, Punta Cana. We have been traveling to different resorts in the Caribbean for many years now. We really look forward to these and when we decide on a resort, we book the vacation months ahead. We then continue to monitor the reviews with excitement. I must say we were all a bit apprehensive when we read so many poor reviews of people getting sick, food was bad and the service was not good.Well, those reviews were far from what we experienced! The food was great, the service outstanding and one of the best resorts we've stayed. None of us got sick at all and never even took an Imodium!! That was the first time none of us got sick on these trips. I would go back in a minute and recommend the Bavaro Princess to anyone wanting a beautiful beach with clear water, no rocks and soft white sand, great food, nice clean rooms, and dedication from the staff who treats you like royalty. My sisters and I live in different states and take these trips to get together to relax, swim, sunbathe, eat and DRINK. We did just that at the Bavaro Princess! The only complaint I have is that the week went entirely too fast!I won't go into all the different food they had, but we enjoyed lobster, paella, shrimp, great Italian dishes, different types of fish, etc. They also had great desserts!It's a beautiful resort and the trams they have to take you from one end to the other are great. It saves on that long walk !!!!!I wish I was back there right now!

<Content>Bravo to Bavaro Princess For all those who posted negative reviews, shame on you...Food amazing, rooms excellent, beaches excellent, pools cleaner than my neighbours ingroud pool.I have to say I had been to Jamaica to what we thought was a 5 star resort and now I have seen what a true 5 star resort is with geniune pride in upkeep and customer service.Well laid out resort with all the amenities and the pride of Punta Cana resort district.For crying out loud, we met a couple who own a travel agency in Dominic Republic and he said the only place he stays in while vacationing in Punta Cana is the Bavaro Princess.A gem!Bravo Bavaro PrincessFern

<Content>Hola!!! Awesome Hotel... One Happy Review Hola Amigos!!! I just got back from my 1 week stay at the Bavaro Princess and had such a great time, that I wanted to write a review. PEOPLE: the staff was great. Always friendly and helpful. ROOM: Originally had a room in the 21 block... don't stay there, ask for a room change. Otherwise, you'll spend your week smelling the septic tank and its noisy engine. We moved to the 40 block which was in-between the main lobby and the beach. The staff was very accomodating. The rooms were immaculate and even has an iron and mini fridge. (Tip: the bottle opener is nailed to the wall). GROUNDS: This hotel was so well maintained and beautifully kept. There is also a bird sanctuary and they had iguanas, ducks, peacocks, frogs, fish, and flamingos! RESTAURANTS: There are so many restaurants at this hotel with many options. I can't believe anyone complained about the food. We ate at El Pescador (lobster!!!) and Bella Pasta (Italian). If you're a late riser, eat breakfast at the Beach Restaurant as it stays open past 10am. ENTERTAINMENT: This hotel is so classy that they had a 6 piece live band every night. The shows were entertaining, especially the Lion King. BEACH: The best beach by far along the coast. Clean, plenty of umbrellas, and nice beach bar. TRANSPORTATION: There is no need to take the tram unless you can't walk. Everything is less than 5 min away.WHAT TO BRING: Don't overload the suitcase. It's so humid that your clothes will weigh more when you leave. Bring bug repellant as I left with 22 bites that were very itchy. We also brought walkie talkies which were very convenient. SHOPPING: There are shops in the hotel but you can walk across the street as well. Walk a little farther to the mall with the grocery store. Everything is cheaper there. Bargain for everything.CASINO: Watch out for the Big Ben. That's all I'll say. TIPS: Please tip your maids. They work very hard for their $$ ************************** Have a great time! **************************

<Content>don't listen to any negative I was so freaked out before I left for my trip since I had read so much negative feedback. My husband and I were at the princess from may 15-may 25, 10 nights in all. We had a great time. the view of the beach from our room was amazing . The room was very clean and very nice. The food was great also. We never had one bad experience in all 11 days !!! We had the platinum package and I will admit I made the right choice with that since the perks are way worth it. Our favorite restaurant was sakura, we went there twice and we also loved El pescador, we each ate a 4lb lobster that was unbeleivable !!!say hello to miguel at sakura and george at the platinum club. they were both amazing.I have no idea what people are talking about when they say anything but positive stuff. Even the shows were great, we went every night............the bottom line, i am from jersey and hard to please, so if I say its a good place....IT IS ...PERIOD..

<Content>A great vacation at a great resort We are from Halifax, Nova Scotia and we stayed at the Bavaro Princess from April 29th to May 6th. It was our first time at an all inclusive resort, but we still had a number of concerns going into the resort.Overall our expectations were met and then some, as the resort was very beautiful, the service was good and the beach and pool were fabulous.More details:Rooms:The rooms were fairly spacious and kept pretty cool by the air conditioning. Sometimes the maids failed to restock things (toilet paper, beer, water, etc) but we never ran out, so it wasn't that big of a problem. We had one problem with the room, and let them know down at the service desk, and by the time we arrived back that night, it was already fixed.Service:The language barrier was difficult at times, but most of the workers knew at least enough to get by, and unless you were after some sort of complex request you could usually get whatever you wanted. Most everyone seemed very friendly and very willing to serve you with a smile, which was very much appreciated. Food:The food could be hit or miss, but if you were open to trying things, and also knew where to look you coudl always find something good. There was a lot of adventuresome food but also a lot of familiar food. Once we found the pasta bar we were pretty much set as you could get a really good and safe meal there any time. However, despite trying to be safe, we both had upset stomaches at various times throughout the week. It was nothing that inhibited us from having a good time though, so no harm done really. We tried two different a la carte restaurants. Chopin was buffet style and had a really great atmosphere and decent food, which was pretty much just a more upscale version of the regular dinner buffet, the Hispaniola. The second we tried was Bella Pasta which was okay, but again, the pasta bar at all the buffets was quite good and you could definitely get your fill of pasta there.Pool and Beach:Perhaps it was due to it being an offseason, but we had no trouble at all getting seats in the shade at the pool or beach, even when we didn't arrive there until 10 or 11 am. As mentioned in most reviews, the beach is absolutely gorgeous and really makes you feel like you are on the set of a movie. The water in the ocean is shockingly warm and it is so nice to just be able to swim and ride the waves for hours without getting cold. The pool is lovely as well, and the water temperature there was quite nice also. No real complaints at all with the pool or beach, they were both great and where we spent the majority of our trip. Drinks:The service for getting drinks was just fine, and the swim up bar in the main pool was definitely a must visit. The waiters and waitresses worked quickly and efficiently at most times, and appreciated any tips, but did not require them for fast service. Some drink reccomendations for those who are about to visit: Coco Loco, Bahama Mama, and a Bavaro Princess. Excursions:We went on the Bavaro Runners excursion on one of our last days. The best part of this trip was driving around the villages and towns and getting to see all the buildings and Dominican village. It was a good experience and we are glad we went, but overall we thought it was slightly overpriced (80 US) and the actual driving from location to location was more of a highlight for us than the actual destinations. The stops were a sugar cane plantation, a tobacco museum and a fruit/coffee/cocoa farm. The stops were kind of neat to see but at the same time it just seemed like they were taking you from place to place in order to get you to buy different merchandise. At the end they take you to the Bavaro Runners beach/ranch where you can go horseback riding and they provide you a meal. Entertainment:The nightly shows were fairly well done and good entertainment. It was amazing to see the resort workers up on stage dancing and entertaining after a long day in the sun working. Overall the shows were entertaining and we would definitely recommend the Bavaro Legends show. Overall we had a fantastic vacation and would not hesitate to come back to the Bavaro Princess. It is a great resort and despite some minor problems and some upset stomaches, the experience was tremendous.

<Content>A First Class Resort My wife an I stayed at Bavaro Princess from May 15th to May 21st. I have to first say that we were a bit unsure about the resort because of all the negative reviews we had read. If you are going to Bavaro Princess in the near future PAY NO ATTENTION to the negative reviews. This resort is one of the most beautiful in Dominican Republic. The rooms grounds and beach are manicured to near perfection, the staff was very friendly and catered to your every need. The food was good, you have so many choices to pick from that you will find something that you will enjoy, I suggest El Goucho Steakhouse. If you are going to DR, remember you are in another country try to speak the langauge. The only concern that I had was for the children at the resort many of the European tourist go topless at the pool and beach. Overall this is a great resort to vacation at, unless you are complainer or just a, miserable person who won't be happy no matter how great a place is........ I almost forgot we met two really nice couples and we wanted to say hello again....Hey Wendy, Josh and Stephanie and Heath

<Content>Pure Paradise!!!!! Bavaro Princess is the most beautiful resort that my husband and I were ever at!!!!! We could not have been more pleased with our visit to the D.R.!!! Not one complaint here!!!! The staff was so very helpful, and KIND we were blown away by it!!! The food was great!!! BEACH is AWSOME!!!!!!!! Juan is the best!!!!! He is at the PLATINUMN LOUNGE!!! People who have complained about food, service, or language, need to be more open minded and understanding of this country and what it has to offer.Mind you that it is a shock from the airport to your resort. Just be thankful that we have what we have and that these people work their butts off when you visit without being nasty to anyone!!!! They are so KIND, AND RESPECTFUL!!!! Just have a great time in this resort. Relax. You will never forget your trip to Punta Cana.

<Content>Beautiful Beautiful resort with the most amazing beaches. The sand was like velvet, no rocks or pebbles. We found two crabs and one tiny crab. The rooms were very romantic and big. The only minor problems we had was when we got there our toilet didn't flush, but the workers came within a couple of hours and had it fixed. The food was pretty good, just different from what we are used to. We always found something to eat and none of us got sick! Staff was always busy and hard working. Would definetly go back. Any questions you can e-mail me!

<Content>Interesting Trip (not in a good way) Okay, let me first say that the hotel and the view was beautiful. When we first arrived, the air in our room did not work, they came and fixed it immediately. The employees are usually nice and are willing to help. The problem came, when booking the trip and packing for the trip we went to the website of the resort to look up the dress codes or to see if there were any. The website said that only a la carte restuarants had dress codes, that were, as follows: Men only have the wear pants to dinner,sleeved shirts (like polos), and closed toed shoes. So by reading this, we packed two pair of dress slacks for my husband. When we checked into the hotel, we were told that every morning we had to get up early and make dinner reservations for every night of our stay. So naturally, we thought that would be one meeting to book the entire week. We were wrong. EVERY morning you have to get up and be IN LINE and wait to book dinner reservations for, at most, one day in advance. Ok, whatever, no big deal. The whole time, we were never told that EVERY restuarant, a la carte or not, with the exception of one, the men had to wear long pants. Keep in mind it's on average 95 degrees and humid as hades. So, the first night we ate at El Gaucho, our husbands wore pants, other men wore shorts. The next night, we went to El Pescador, and the same thing. So we were frustrated and ask to speak to the manager

<Content>Excellent, relaxing vacation I, Iike most people, read the reviews prior to our departure and was a little more then apprehensive about our stay. Looking back, I realize now that some people expect way to much for what they are paying for. My boyfriend and I stayed at the resort from 5/7 to 5/13 and loved every moment of it. Check-in was a breeze and our luggage was at our room the same time we were, so no problems there. Equally as simple was our check out. No problems there and NO hidden charges or fees. We just turned in our safe key and room keys and we were done. We thought the food was good and had no problem finding something to eat every night. Neither one of us got sick from the food, however I did end up with an upset tummy after one too many Bailey's our first night there. We found the service at all the restaurants to be prompt and pleasant. They were attentive to our requests and were quick to refill our drinks. The house wine is fine, it's definitely not the best by any means, but it's drinkable. As I said, we never got sick from the food and we tried just about everything. Just remember that sun and alcohol don't mix. We were mindful not to have too much dairy based frozen drinks or too much to drink in general while lying in the sun. That is the number one reason why people end up sick. Drink plenty of water. A good tip that we read from another TripAdvisor member was to bring insulated cups. The bartenders were more then happy to fill them up for us and it eliminated warm drinks and numerous trips to the beach bar. We decided to upgrade to the Platinum package and would recommend this to everyone. Some of the perks that we enjoyed were the top shelf liquor, the 20 min massage on the beach, the Platinum lounge where there are snacks and unlimited wine, rum, and champagne, not having to wake up early to make dinner reservations, nightly turn down service, free room service, and the hour snorkeling excursion. We really enjoyed being able to take bottles of wine or champagne back to the room so we could enjoy it on our balcony! The room was just as shown on the pictures and was kept clean and fully stocked our entire stay. We left small gifts three days and never received any extra attention so do not stress about leaving small gifts. If anything, leave them b/c you actually want the maid to have them.The nightly entertainment is just that, entertaining. It's nice to take a trip to the front lobby for an after dinner drink and catch some of the shows. As far as getting around the resort, we never had a problem. I think the longest time we waited for a tram was 2 minutes!We only did one excursion which was the mini jet boats. We had a great time doing this and laughed the whole time. We were pleasantly surprised by the food, service, and amenities this resort has to offer. The beach was beautiful and we never had a problem reserving a palapa as long as we were up by 7 am!! All in all we had an excellent time and would definitley return!!

<Content>Platinum Club We stayed at the Bavaro Princess from April 29-May 6. We opted to upgrade to Platinum Club, and it was well worth the extra $100 each. When we arrrived at hotel, we immediately got on tram to Platinum Lounge. We checked in (this was at 11AM), and walked to our room. Luggage arrived about 20 minutes later. We had dinner at Licey that night (included in Platinum), which was very good. With Platinum, we, also, had dinner at restaurants at two other Princess Hotels. They pick you up at Lounge and take you to other hotel. Then, they pick you up after dinner to take you back to your hotel. Maid service was exceptional. Food at hotel (buffets) was average for the DR. Don't forget, this is a very large hotel with a lot of guests. Neither one of us got sick from the food. Maybe the people that got sick were in the sun too much, or drinking too much. I think for the price of our trip (I have been to the DR 5 times) it was a nice hotel. I don't understand all the complaints.

<Content>wedding at Bavaro We got married at the Bavaro Princess on April 27th...things couldn't have been better. We had a beautiful ceremony, went off without a hitch, and had a private beach party reception afterwards. We would highly recommend doing this (extra cost) We saw a few other wedding parties in the a la carte restauarants, and it wasn't half as nice. Gabriel the wedding coordinator was very professional...There were 40 guests that came down (from the US and Canada) and a few got sick...but I think most of the time it was from sun and drink...the only complaint I have is that Sunwing (Canadian tour operator) puts there guest in the junior suites in the back of the resort...they are older and not half as nice as the bungalows...so if you can stay away from them, do so.The service was fantastic, beach amazing, and food hit and miss...mostly hit, and to think of the size of the place and all the guests they have to feed, they do a great job for the most part. Grounds are beautiful. We stayed in the 600's and would recommend them...close to everything.We heard a few complaints from people, and most of them not warranted...these are people who probably complain wherever they go...the resort is gorgeous, go and have an amazing time...

<Content>Just o.k. My husband and I traveled to Bavaro Princess the first week of April. We looked forward to this for many months. The flight was wonderful, USA300 is a fantastic airline. Arrival was smooth and transfer to the hotel was good, we traveled with Apple Vacations. We got to the resort after about a 30 minute drive, which was interesting through the country side. The resort is impressive, but the service was disappointing. We arrived with no welcome at all. We have traveled to Mexico and Jamaica and have been warmly welcomed as you step off the bus in the other resorts we had stayed. Here, we had to find our own way to the check-in (very long) line. After standing in line for about 20 wasted minutes, we were told to go stand another line because we upgraded to the Platinum package. I would think that since we paid more, we would have been given a little better direction. Another 20 minutes gone by and all we have done is stand around wondering what to do. The English, even for the front of the house staff, is below par. Yes, I'm in their country, but if they wish to be a tourist destination, then better language accommodations should be made. We finally make it to the Platinum lounge after about an hour, this is where we are to check-in. They were better accommodating here with a little better English. The room was gorgeous, the beach was fabulous, housekeeping and ground maintenance at this resort are excellent, these staffs need to be commended for their hard work. On the other hand, the front of the house staff, front desk, bell staff, servers, bartenders, etc, need quite a bit of training on servicing the guests and making them feel welcome. I have worked in hotel management for many years, I do look for exceptional service, which this resort did not have. The food is definitely under par. The buffet for breakfast and lunch by the beach was scary to say the least. Dinner at Licey was nice, service here rated a little better. The rest of the outlets are questionable. All in all, we managed to have a good time more because we appreciate the warm weather and beautiful country. We would probably go back to Punta Cana, but would not stay at Princess, unless management makes some changes and decided to train their front of the house staff on the importance of guest service.

<Content>People and bad reviews All i have to say is any one who is complaining about this resort should get an attude check and leave the resort because people like my wedding group of 20 loved every moment and everyone there, it is the attuded of the nasty people who make our trips questionable. It is a beautiful resort and the people are there to make your stay good, they are the nicest people we have ever met, they are not you slaves so give them respect.Just be thankful you can afford to go anywhere with an ocean.

<Content>Nothing but Blue Skies and Sunshine We stayed at the Bavaro Princess from April 30th - May 7th, we were a group of 26 people for a wedding... To be honest before I left for this trip I didn't know what to expect, I had read many reviews good and bad and by the time I Ieft I really had no clue what to look forward to. We arrived at the resort in the evening around 10:30 pm, check-in was a breeze... The first thing we all did was check out our suites which were all Junior suites, no complaint from me here, sure it's in a big complex and not the bungalows but to be honest I wouldn't have had it any other way (close to the lobby for drinks, the buffet and the main trolley stop... perfect!). Our Tv didn't work, only had 13 channels and all in Spanish but who cares, we didn't spend much time in our rooms anyway lol. The one thing I was worried about before we left was the weather, I had read that May was the rainy season because of the high humidity, but not a drop a rain during our whole entire stay, not even at night, everyday was as bright and sunny as could be and hot like you wouldn't believe, but that's the whole point of going to the carribean right! The food was great, I pretty much ate whatever I felt like, fish, fruit, caviar, meat... I never got sick once, I think it's all in what kind of food you are used to eating, I have a pretty ethnic pallet so for me I was no biggy, even my boyfriend who is picky found food he enjoyed without feeling sick. The beach... WOW! Amazing, by far this resort has the best one, lots of chairs, always some available, maybe not under the shade but you have the beautiful ocean to cool off in... There is a great little market on the beach, about a 20 minute walk from the Bavaro Princess, definitely go there to buy souvenirs, you can get great bargains. The nightly shows, the ones I did see, were good... The Lion King by far the best one! If you plan on attending activities outside the resort I recommend the Snorkling with Marinarium, you see lots of tropical fish in the coral reef, even sharks (don't worry they're harmless) and stingrays, one piece of advice, buy you're underwater camera with whoever you book your tour with, they sell them way more expensive on the Marinarium boat. We went Banana Boating, not the best but for $10.00 US it's something to do besides tanning lol. Getting a base tan is a good idea, I did and I applied SPF 15 on multiple times during the day and I didn't burn, not even peeling yet. One thing I do want to talk about is the bar service, sometimes you could be waiting there for 20 min. to get a drink... The waiters serve the tippers before you, so be prepared, we tried tipping the first night and I didn't work too well so we just said screw it, we didn't mind waiting but like I said... Be prepared to wait if you don't tip... To sum this up, this resort is fantastic, by far one of the nicer looking ones around (we saw quite a few on the Marinarium pick-up bus). I think it's all in what you make of it, you go there up on your high horses, yeah you're gunna be picky and complain, you go there to relax and have fun, it'll be just fine! So relax and take it easy, what's the point in complaining on a vacation!!!

<Content>Bathrooms are great! My family and I decided to go to Bavaro Princess from 4/24/ to 4/29 for a long overdue vacation from the day to day hustle. I must say, if you like to spend your time in a bathroom, this is the place for you! Three of the four of us had stomach problems by day 2. This was after eating at Bella Pasta. We were thankful that the staff provided ample quantities of toilet paper during our stay. However, we were not so pleased that the water pressure was to low to provide us with a nice hot shower. Other than these problems, the beaches and weather are second to none.

<Content>Hugely Disappointing I was really hoping to be one of the people to come back and write a rave review about this resort, but unfortunately it is not to be. I am re-reading some of the reviews from people who loved it and it is unbelievable that my experience was so different. I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from 4/29-5/6. I traveled with my husband and another couple - we are all in our early 30's. I understand that we are in a different country and I don't believe that I had unrealistic expectations by any stretch of the imagination. I promise you that I am not spoiled, pretentious or high maintenance. Rooms: The rooms were large and clean. There is a musty smell, but you do get over it after a few minutes. There were some issues, however. Our television broke on day 2. The cord and cable extension were ripped out of the wall. The mini-refrigerator leaked and there was standing water in our room that the cleaning service failed to notice (despite generous tips each day). We saw the guy who re-stocked our refrigerator on Day 2 and gave him $10 to hook us up. That didn't happen - we had two stale beers in our refrigerator every day. There were random power outages - not just the energy conservation outages, but outages at 7PM when you were trying to get ready for dinner. Also, two days in a row without our shampoo being re-stocked. Obviously, none of these are deal killers (how much time do you really spend in your room?). At the same time, it starts to get frustrating when it's something different every day.Food/booze: I religiously took acidophilus prior to our trip as well as a pepto bismol caplet each morning. Didn't help. Three of the four of us experienced food poisoning. In fact, we ended up eating dinner for four nights of our trip at a restaurant outside of the resort. If you are dying for something edible, go to High Wave across the street. The beer was warm, the rum was decent and the mixed drinks had an obscene amount of grenadine. It's very difficult to get restaurant reservations. If you have the opportunity to book them ahead of time, do so and save yourself from getting up before 8AM, taking a trolley to the main lobby and waiting in line for 20 minutes.Service: It was either really good or really bad. Most of the bartenders at the pool and beach area were very helpful. Some of the people working at the lunch and breakfast buffets were not so helpful. The people working at the front desk were no treat either. Beach: The beach is as beautiful as everyone says. We were able to get chairs every day by either the beach or pool. If you have patience, you can normally find people abandoning the coveted huts by early afternoon. We participated in deep sea fishing (crowded on the boat the size of a dust mite for four hours - didn't catch anything), snorkeling (murky water...jellyfish) and swimming with the dolphins on Dolphin Island (a four hour trip in which 25 minutes are actually in the water with the dolphins - basically to pose for two pictures that you can later purchase for $8 a pop). At the end of the day, this is a HUGE resort and everything was just more of a hassle than you want to have on a vacation (trolley rides, waiting in line for dinner reservations, trying to get a chaise lounge, issues with the room etc.). In the future, I will spend more money to stay somewhere a little more intimate and have good service/food. If you have been on all inclusive vacations before and have been happy with them, this will most likely not meet your expectations.

<Content>mixed review on Bavaro Princess Hubby and I were at the Bavaro Princess from April 22 - 29, 2006. We did get the platinum package and were one building from the beach. To say this is a 5 star resort is a gross over statement. It a 3 star resort. It is agreed that the grounds are lovely and the people are nice. We found the rooms to be large and accommodating if not just a tad worn with wonderfully colored walls. We got the impression that they are trying to modernize the furniture a little at a time with some success. We did like our room. The restaurant food and service was inconsistant at best and varied from restaurant to restaurant and night to night in the same restaurant. We had a good meal at Bella Pasta and decided to return- the service was also great the first time. The second time the food was less than good and the service was terrible. We ate in all of the restaurants and found Sakura and the Gourmet restaurant to be the best. The Licey served a rack of lamb and asked how I like it cooked. The service was also very good. But beware if ordering wine. We were charged $ 26 for a bottle of wine. We signed a tab for $ 26 dollars and received a bill at checkout for $ 36 and when we questioned it we were shown a menu for $ 46. The manager was not available ,of course ,and they could not find the charge we signed. We will let the credit card company fight it out. Conflict resolution is not one of their strengths at this resort.- they tend to handle things by avoidance.We never waited more than 5 min for a tram. Most of the activity occured for us about 100 feet from our room. The three restaurants were there and the beach was just a step away. We spent our week on the beach under a much coveted palapa. BTW- if you want a palapa you must reserve it by 7am each morning . They are gone by 8am. The pool is the same only earlier. It is also very hot.The airport is a nightmare. The airlines moved the flight up an hour and the bus was on the original schedule. While we arrived at the counter to check in for the return flight it is being called. We had to yet go through a verry long line to immigration. If it was not for a couple who grabbed an immigration person to help us all walk through we would have missed our flight. We were being paged overheadad we were running to the gate.We will not return again. It was ok but nothing to tell your friends about. We have been to some wonderful all inclusives and this was not one of them. Also, practice your Spanish. it does make a difference.

<Content>Had A Great Vacation.... We just spent our 10th anniversary at the Bavaro Princess from April 23-27 and had a great time. The resort is beautiful and exceptionally clean. We also found it to be very peaceful and quiet, especially in the evenings. We went with 2 other couples and all of us had a great time. Like other reviews have said, the food is edible, but not outstanding. The best restaurant we went to was Chopin. It had good atmosphere and the food was better than the buffet. We didn't care for Bella Pasta at all. That's not saying that the food there was horrible, but it wasn't to our taste preference. The omelet bar in the buffet was great.The beach was gorgeous but you have to reserve a chair in the shade early in the morning or you won't find one. We spent everyday that we were there at the beach and we were never bored. There was always something going on (i.e. beach volleyball, merengue lessons, water aerobics, etc.). We also found a whole new appreciation for frozen drinks- make sure to try the Coco Loco and the Banana Royal- DELICIOUS!We all took the Saona Island excursion and would recommend it to anyone. They served the best food of the trip right there on the beach and we saw the most beautiful water and sand anywhere! It was a great adventure.Only two negatives from my point of view: would have like there to have been more of a nightlife at the resort where we could go dance and listen to music (THE CASINO AND NIGHTCLUB AVAILABLE AT THE RESORT ARE LAME) and the food could have been better. Like others have said, there was a little sickness with all of us at one point or another- nothing serious, but just not feeling well for a couple of the days. Otherwise we all had a great time and got plenty of rest and relaxation. We would definately go back to Punta Cana again!

<Content>Excellent family vacation! Traveled to Bavaro Princess, April 16-23. Group of 17, 8 adults and 9 kids(8 teens from 13-18 and 1 five yr old) ArrivalScheduled air flight through TNT Vacations was great! My least favorite part of the trip is the Punta Cana airport. Although it鈥檚 nice enough, the process is unclear and confusing. Some of us were given Tourist cards on the plane, others were not. You each must complete one and pay $10 upon arrival. That fee may be included in charter flights. Our TNT Rep was right at the curb and had a bus waiting for us and all our luggage. Never gave our luggage up to porters鈥ust kept saying no thank you and moving toward curb. Transfer to resort was smooth. Passing through the DR countryside gave us all a chance to understand how the local people lived. It made us appreciate the hard-working people we met at the resort.Check-inWe had a total of 7 rooms. All but two were ready. While waiting, we just made it into the main buffet before they closed at 3:00, which was great because we were very hungry after our long day of traveling. We were given room key cards and towel cards. It wasn鈥檛 until we got to the rooms that we realized we had to ask for a safe key. We had to walk back to the front desk to get one. At check in everyone in the party is given a bracelet, blue for adults and orange for kids. Although, it appeared to me that they were not really interested in the age of the kids, whatever you say goes. Blue gets them drinks, although orange seem to work just as well. Blue also gets them into disco and casino. RoomsI really liked the lay-out of the rooms. They have been described in many reviews so I won鈥檛 repeat. My highlights are these: the separate sleeping area allows for TV watching or reading while traveling partner is sleeping. Also I loved the balcony for sipping coffee and reading. There always seemed to be a lovely breeze and shade. Plenty of drawer and closet space. Housekeeping in our building was always there by 2PM. However, others in our group were visited by housekeeping late afternoon which is a little inconvenient when trying to get ready for dinner or just chill out after a day at the beach. I left my housekeeper $3/day and had everything I needed. My husband was a little disappointed that we could not get Presidente in the room. The beer in the mini-fridge was not great!Beach and PoolThe beach is spectacular. We walked a long distance in both directions and felt that we definitely had the widest, cleanest beach in the area. The pool is sprawling and clean. Getting chairs became a shared daily chore in our group. Although policy is that you cannot save chairs, everyone does it. We took turns putting out towels. We were usually out by 7:00AM. There were plenty of chairs in the sun, but not the shade. One day a member of our group was up at 1:00AM and decided to take a few towels down to the beach, the next morning we got a shade hut. I guess it depends on how bad you want shade. Same process was happening at the pool, although we really preferred to make our home base on the beach. Bring and use lots of sunscreen. Even the seasoned sun worshippers in the group got too much sun in some cases, many were peeling by the end of our stay. Scuba Caribe 鈥渞eps鈥?are walking the beach all the time to get you into banana boating and parasailing. If you want to do this, schedule ahead, we learned it鈥檚 not something you can do spur of the moment. Also, there are usually breaking waves and the kids went to the watersports shack and borrowed boogie boards, very fun! The animation team does an excellent job of getting people involved in games on the beach and in the pool. There were dance lessons, aerobics, volleyball, archery and many more.Bars and RestaurantsI will not ramble about the food. It鈥檚 different and takes getting used to. Don鈥檛 go to the Dominican Republic if food quality will make or break your vacation. You might be disappointed. With 17 people, including picky teens and a 5 year old, we always found something to eat. Other than minor stomach issues, no one was 鈥渞uin the trip鈥?or 鈥渟tay in the room鈥?sick. The reservation process for the al a carte restaurants was really inconvenient and my biggest complaint of the trip. The reservation desk opened at 8:00AM. In order to get our large group in anywhere I learned that I needed to be in line by 7:15AM. Bring a book! Even then, you are making your reservations for the next evening, because most of the restaurants are full for that evening. We alternated between the buffet and al a cartes. Bella Pasta: Most all liked it. It tasted most like home. Pasta is pasta. Certainly was not a 鈥渇ine鈥?Italian dining experience, but it was good. Service was very good.El Pescador: Just the adults went to this restaurant. Kids went across the way to Bella Pasta for a second time. It was fair. We all love seafood and are used to fresh, well-cooked choices. My husband ordered a shrimp cocktail and 鈥渟hrimp鈥?well described it. The 4 shrimp were about the size of a quarter and hanging off the side of a huge sauce cup. Quite disappointing. Much of the seafood is served in it鈥檚 shell and eating it takes a lot of effort. Overall the taste is fine and the service here was good.Sakura: This was our last night 鈥渟pecial鈥?dinner. Food was fair at best. Service was poor. Just didn鈥檛 meet our expectations of oriental food. Hispanola (main buffet): Always found something to eat. Allowed for flexibility in dinner times to take in shows, etc. Especially good for breakfast, although only open until 10:00, so late risers missed out. I like the omelets and toast. Just like home.El Gaucho (lunch buffet): Nice salad bar everyday. There were burgers on this buffet, but they were soaked in water or something and no one really like them. On a side food note. If your kids are at all picky, take a bottle (or 2) or Heinz Ketchup and ranch dressing. We did but it didn鈥檛 last long enough with a big group. One day a lady on the beach from Pittsburgh offered us a little of her Heinz which kept the 5 yr old from a complete melt down. I know鈥ut little things make for an enjoyable, peaceful vacation for all!The bars were all great. We never waited in long lines and service was excellent. We actually found that if you made yourself a regular, they worked very hard to know what you wanted and went about making drinks quickly when they saw you coming. We tipped $1, most trips to the bar. Taking insulated cups was a great recommendation that I read before going. Saves bar trips. Also, staying hydrated was important and there was ice and a water cooler in the El Gaucho area all day. ShowsThe animation team is very hard working and talented. They put in very long hours. The two shows I can recommend are the Lion King, which was excellent and Legends, which our daughters (13) saw and loved.Overall PositivesWe all found the workers in all areas to be incredibly hard-working and eager to please. They smiled and greeted us with 鈥渉ola鈥?most of the time. The resort was very clean. Transportation was always available if you were too tired to walk, but the walking was what kept us from gaining too much weight! We felt the resort was very safe. Our teens were required to be in at least pairs, but they were allowed to move freely about the resort. They never felt unsafe and we never worried.A couple of minor negativesThere was a distinct sewer odor a couple of evenings. It was between the 20鈥檚 and high teens buildings. It seemed to pass in the morning and was not noticeable. There was not much for teens to do in the evening. They all wanted to go outside the resort to a disco, but that uncomfortable for us adults. They eventually found a group of other kids their age and 鈥渉ung out鈥?at the El Gaucho and beach area in the late evening. The volleyball court was lit and they played volleyball. Would be nice for the 15-18 age kids to have a disco or place to hang out. We all would go back to the Bavaro Princess. For the price, it was well worth it. E-mail me if you have questions.

<Content>Just got back from Bavaro Princess 4/29/2006 My husband and I just returned from a weeks vacation from Bavaro Princess. I think after reading reviews you might feel a bit unsatisfied as to what to expect. However, I am sure you will be pleasantly surprised. I did book us for the Platinum VIP Package. We did not check in at the main lobby, however where taken via mini-train to the Platinum lounge. We did have extra perks with this package that were nice. We stayed in 814 which is less than 5 minutes to the beach and main pool. We were across from the platinum lounge, so we could always run down and get fresh sodas, coffee, few snacks, or use the internet, and watch tv. We realized quickly the first day that the breakfast buffet by the beach is not really good at all. We tried the hamburgers, and we didn't really like the taste. The hot dogs were good. So my husband would ride the mini-train down to the main buffet Hispanola for breakfast and lunch. The selection is great, fresh food etc. Since we had the Pl. VIP we were able to make reservations just by calling. So, no getting up early running around or waiting in lines! We liked eating at 8:30 pm, gave us plenty of time to relax after being in the sun all day. Bella Pasta was good, Sakora was good although my husband had the sushi, it might have made his stomach a bit upset. I enjoyed all of my items, especially the chicken chow mein. We really enjoyed our complimentary dinner at Licey (perk of VIP, not included in regular packages). My husbad had salad, then loberstail tail for dinner. I had braised lamb with tomatoes, wow, very good. Desserts were fabulous! All the staff there really went out of their way to wait on you and make sure you dinner was great. We didn't get sick, or hear of anyone getting sick. Maybe some people had upset tummies. But if you are prone to have tummy issues, then take pepto, or whatever for iwith you and you'll be fine. I guess anywhere you go, you should always be careful what you eat. The grounds to the hotel are very nice, they really do work hard and long days to keep it looking so beautiful. The pools were nice, but my favorite spot is on the beach. Kids who do not swim well shouldn't be alone due to currents. But in the shallows there was alot of children playing. I never got smacked around by waves. A beach isn't fun without waves! The water feels great and w/ the breeze you never felt too hot. I remember times sitting at the pool and after 5 minutes I felt the sun beating on me. You do have to get up early to get chairs under that huts. I got up ONCE at 8:30 and they were all taken. After that, I said hey I am on vacation, I am not getting up at dawn just for chairs. We never had a problem finding other lounge chairs. Not once did we have a problem!Don't forget bugspray. The mosquitos will nibble on you! Make sure to take a hat, that will really help you keep cool, and keep from burning! US dollars are accepted everywhere.If you can, tip your maid. Driving to the resort you really get an idea of just how poor the surrounding area is.The atmosphere is fun and relaxed. Alot of different people and languages. It will help to make an effort to speak Spanish to any of the staff. I am afraid that some we ran into didn't understand much English. But no one was ever rude to us. Remember you are in their country, and sometimes things are done differently. I loved the stay here, and would recommend it at least once to anyone. However, I am not sure we'll be repeats back to Dominican Republic.If anyone has any questions, feel free to email me.

<Content>Bavaro Princess is great We stayed at the Bavaro Princess 4/22 to 4/29 and we loved it. I read all the reviews before we left and I was very pleasntly surprised. True, the food is not gourmet, but it is certainly better then many of the reviews indicate. The dining is typical, all-inclusive fare and there are enough options to please anyone whose expectations are reasonable, And the beach is gorgeous!!! The pool and grounds are also beautiful, extremely clean, and well cared for. The room was spacious and kept imaculately clean. We found absolutely no problems with the service and did not feel we had to wave a dollar bill just to get a drink. Not once did I see people with tip money or a VIP bracelet get better service. In fact, several times bartenders gave me top shelf stuff without me asking - just to be nice. I think a lot of people blame the staff when the problem is their own attitude. I found the peple friendly and warm. We intend to go back to this resort again and again.

<Content>Bavaro Princess Wedding We stayed at the Bavaro Princess from Apr 22-29. Our group had 9 people in 4 rooms and the reviews were mixed. Our travel agent had requested rooms near each other and close to the beach. We ended up with 1 room near the beach, 1 not too far and 2 at the farthest point from the beach. (If you're there for your honeymoon, be prepared - the honeymoon suites are about a 10 minute walk from the beach)Check-in was ok for 3 rooms, but my wife and I had to wait over an hour to have our bags brought to the room. This was after spending more than 30 minutes trying to find the room. The honeymoon suites are not on the map and the only directions we received in English were it's that way. As part of the wedding/honeymoon package, we were supposed to receive a welcome fruit basket and a late check-out time. We didn't get either of these.The wedding was wonderful. The wedding coordinator (Gabriel) took care of everything. The service was later in the day so we missed the most intense sun. The view of the beach was incredible. Our bartender and the cameraman were excellent. Both spoke fluent English and were extremely helpful.The beach at this resort is very nice. The sand is soft and white. The only complaint is that you need to get up very early to have any chance at getting one of the huts. The water was warm and very refreshing after soaking up the HOT sun (make sure you bring lots of sun block).The grounds are amazing. There are lots of different birds and plants to see. They also have a walkway built through the mangroves. You can expect to see flamingos, peacocks and lots of little lizzards. Watch out for the geese - they expect to be fed and will let you know it :-)The food was hit or miss (mostly miss). Half of our group enjoys seafood and the other half doesn't. The seafood lovers were not impressed, except the night they went to the seafood restaurant. Bella pasta was quite good. Most of our meals were at the main buffet, which had a lot of the same food over and over. The best part was all the fresh fruit. It was incredible, so sweet and full of flavour!!Our wedding dinner was at Licey. The food was very good, but the service was beyond slow. It took about 1.5 hours to get our meals.Check-out was a nightmare. We had to be out of our rooms by noon, but the bus to the airport didn't leave until 6:00. We were promised a locked room for our luggage and a courtesy room to shower before we left. The locked room ended up being the curb near the front of the resort. After waiting over 2 hours to have our luggage picked up, we ended up carting it to the front of the resort by ourselves. We did hear others complaining of similar problems. The courtesy room was a joke. There was only 1 clean towel for the 2 of us. The bathroom floor was soaked and slippery and there was no shower head. It seemed quite apparent they no longer cared since we had already checked out. The bars at the front of the resort were much better than the beach. At the beach they put so much alcohol in each drink that it drowns out any flavor. We're not heavy drinkers, so we didn't really enjoy the drinks at the beach.The nightly entertainment is quite good. They bring in dancers and do a different stage show each night.Overall we had a good time. The rooms were nice and the resort was very clean. We didn't have problems with musty rooms and food poisoning like other reviews have complained about. The resort certainly wasn't terrible, but be prepared for some problems particularly with slow service.

<Content>I can't wait to go back My husband and I and two other couples celebrated our 10 wedding anniversarys here, and I did not want to leave. It was so beautiful. The food was okay, but we knew that it would be different. We took the Saona Island Tour and I recommend it. It was the most beautiful place that I have ever seen. We had the best food on the Island. BBQ Dominican Style. The Island tour is a must. Everyone at the resort was so nice and the people that work there are such hard workers. I can't wait to go back. We are taking our kids next time.

<Content>Dont go to Bavaro or to the Dominican for that matter. I won a trip for work so they sent us to this place for 4 days. I found the grounds to be ok ..very lush and pretty but very busy with bustling workers, trolleys, people. This place seemed old and beat up a bit. I liken it to this example: Its like if you go to a nice private college and then you go and visit your friend who attends a state university in massachusetts.. The architecture is all poured concrete and not very well kept... just cold and smells like urine.Honestly, I found the nighttime to be the best time to be outside at this resort. There is just too many people. The pool bar is jammed all day with people. The frozen drinks are real syrupy and not very slushy. (this is the case at all the bars). El Presidente beer tastes like bottled farts. I stepped on glass in the pool and have to go to a doctor to get it removed in the US.The food at this place is terrible. Absolutely. They have these great big spreads but its all nasty stuff. Its not kept well (hot or cold). 5 people in our group of 30 got sick. 2 of them had to stay in bed for 2 days. I'm not kidding here. They ate some crap at the seafood place.The room smelled very musty/moldy. mine was #102... They where all concrete and very cold feeling, not cosy. The room layout is not very good either.I would not pay to go to this resort. In fact I will never go to the Dominican again. I'm glad I had this free trip to find out all about it.Go to Aruba or Mexico. This place is a waste.

<Content>9 Coco Loco's out of 10 My husband and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from April 6 to 13. We were extremely excited but very apprehensive considering the negative reviews that we had read prior to our departure. We arrived in Punta Cana after a 6 1/2 hour flight. I was amazed by the humidity when we exited the plane. The weather was gorgeous. After being very confused, we found our tour guide and were directed to a bus to take us to our hotel. The ride was about 1/2 hour and it was a good opportunity to see the countryside. I couldn't believe the poverty; it was heartbreaking and I had mixed feelings about staying at a 4+ star resort because of it. We are all so lucky that we can afford to travel!The bus dropped us off at the hotel and we were informed to leave our luggage at the curb. I felt weird about this but left it anyhow; it was fine. Check in was smooth, but they didn't offer much information about how to get around the resort; we were pretty much left to find everything out on our own. We were booked to stay in the 89 block (I had emailed earlier requesting a room near the beach). The lady helping us at check in said it was in the middle of the resort and gave us a map, circling where it was (the # wasn't on the map as it was a newer building). We walked for the next 30 minutes trying to find it, then we asked for directions and were told it was in a completely different spot than where we were originally told). We found the bungalow right next to the lobby, far from the beach. Our view was of the main road and construction and the key to the room didn't work. Frustrated, we went back to the lobby. They were very accommodating and gave us a room in building 30 near the pool. The room was nice, but worn. The closet door was broken and the paint was peeling, but it was very spacious and clean. We had a fantastic view. The grounds are incredibly beautiful and very well tended to. I was very concerned about the reports of food poisoning at this resort. Being a strict vegetarian my options were limited. I had been warned not to eat the vegetables or unpeeled fruit so I was very worried about what to eat. Our first night we were taking the trolly and an American woman sat next to us. Ironically, she had been hired to help determine why such illnesses were occurring. She explained that all water for consumption was purified and the vegetables and fruit were all cleaned thoroughly, sanitized for 15 minutes. She took us through the buffet and explained what was vegetarian and what wasn't! It was amazing to meet her as I was SO worried about getting sick. My husband (a non-vegetarian) and I ate everything and neither of us became ill at all. We LOVED the food. We ate at the main buffet, beach buffet, Bella pasta and Chopin and thought that there was a large variety and something for everyone. We thought the food was fantastic and are confused about why people complained! The drinks were really good, very strong! The coco loco (ice cream, chocolate and rum) was amazing. The service was wonderful, the staff appreciated attempts at communication very much. We tipped very freely and were saddened to see that many people did not tip. The workers spend 10 hours a day 6 days a week working for $200-500 a month American and appreciated tips so much. We had such good service, people remembering our names and where we liked to sit. We don't speak Spanish, but I speak Frensh and that helped. Some of the workers and tour guides speak French, English, German, or Dutch.The maids did an excellent job and were very friendly. The beach was gorgeous although I had expected the water to be more calm and maybe some rocks or cliffs off the beach. The beach was wide and long and the tide could be quite rough. It was fun though to play in the waves and the water was still clear enough to see fish swimming by despite sand being turned up. Palapas are not supposed to be reserved however the hotel does not enforce that policy. It was not uncommon to see reserved palapas with no one sitting there for many hours. This was extremely frustrating. My husband and I did not get to use a palapa once because of this. We went on the outback safari and the snorkeling tour. Both were so much fun. The Caribbean festival was awesome; very entertaining and the staff were willing to help with anything. The boogie boarding beach was absolutely gorgeous (don鈥檛 forget to bring items for the school kids you鈥檒l meet at the Outback tour- pencils/notebooks). My husband parasailed, thought it was great but it was $45.00 for about a 10 minute ride. We went to the shopping center about 2 blocks from the hotel and found it very overwhelming. The vendors were extremely pushy, borderline rude. I鈥檝e been to Mexico and the shopping that we experienced in the Dominican was very different. No problems with check out. Also, we saw 4 mosquitoes our entire trip and I was bit once; didn鈥檛 take the chloroquine. It was a fantastic holiday; I鈥檇 love to stay at the Bavaro Princess again.

<Content>I wish I paid closer attention to the negative reviews Just like everyone here, I diligently read all the positive and negative reviews, thought that those who wrote negative reviews were spoiled brats (please forgive me now) and took a leap of faith-a family of 4, with two kids, ages 3 and 7. For the first time in my traveling experience, I wish I paid more attention to the negative reviews, but after all, the last resort we went to was Sandals MoBay and the reviews were mixed as well, but we had time of our lives. OK, so let me start:Positives:1. Rooms-this is the resort's biggest playing card. They are clean, spacious and comfortable. Kids each had a twin size bed, we had a king size bed in a separate area, the bathroom is huge as well. Both hot and cold waters were running great, we always had plenty of clean towels and supplies. First floors have patios, second floors have terraces. We were in bldg 84, about 5 minute walk to the beach and 10-15 minute walk to the main area. Overall, I am more than impressed by the room. The maid service was not coming in at the same time each day, somtimes, they would be planning to do cleaning during kids nap times, and then it would be too late, but they always made sure to leave clean towels and drinks on the terrace. 2. Grounds-are vast and beautiful. There is a shuttle bus and sometimes, they are full, no big deal, just hop on the next one, or break your group in two and go. The kids enjoyed the mangrove and the birds, it's very pleasant to take a walk before/after dinner and enjoy the nature. 3. Entertainers-these guys do terrific job. In the mornings, they round folks up for volleyball, salsa dancing lessons at the beach, and at night, they put on amazing shows. We especially enjoyed the Lion King, the Tropical Show and the Legends in Concert. These are young and talented folks who deserve numerous rounds of applause. Each of them is like a mix of a dancer, acrobat and gymnast. Negatives:4. The beach-while the beach is indeed long and wide, forget about getting a beach chair if you are a late sleeper. And, I am not even talking about a beach chair under the palapa, even under the hot sun, there was nothing available! The sand itself is silky. The water can get choppy, not resort's fault, Punta Cana is on the North Atlantic Ocean, not Carribean Sea, so be prepared that there will be days when it might be not safe for kids to go into the water. 5. The pool-again, it's nice and big, same problem with getting the chairs. 6. Food and service-the food in the buffet is served in open trays, so flies are all over it and you cannot help but be disgusted about eating it. The best bet was pasta and grill stations, and the service on both of them was pretty good. The waitresses are hit or miss. For example, for 6 days in a row, they have been bringing soft drinks to the table, then one day when I am sitting with two kids while hubby is out getting them food, I ask one to bring some juice and she tells me I can go and get it myself. Even if this option now exists, it is a common courtesy to help a lady with two little kids! Also, only a few tables have fans above them, so the room is very, very hot. Also, they don't let you take food outside the room, so if your kid feels like having a banana for an 11 AM snack, good luck here. To book a restaurant, you have to be at the service desk prior to 8 AM, and once you get to the front, there is no guarantee that there will be spot you want. You can only book for today or tomorrow, not for the entire stay. They only do 3 seatings per evening and book each rest. half-full. I guess this ensures that a) they are cost-efficient by feeding you cheap food at the buffet rather than give you good fare at the rest. b) they don't strain their staff too much by allowing them to take a nice long break between each seating. We were able to book 3 times out of 7 days, El Gaucho was really great, Bella Pasta and El Pescador were OK. On the last day, we found out that if you booked with Apple Vacations, and you go to orientation, after that, they would book the rests. for the duration of your stay.I was there during the spring break, so maybe when resort is not crowded, all the things I wrote above are not applicable, but it just seems that too many things I wrote about were the same issues other people complained about. And, the worst part is-I speak Spanish well, not perfectly, but certainly well enough for a decent conversation. In Mexico, it helped a lot, we would get a great service before even the tips started flying, here, it was useless. So, to sum it up-I would NEVER return to Bavaro Princess again. I might travel to Punta Cana again to another resort, I heard IberoStar visitors were very happy.

<Content>Beautiful place, food and service hit or miss My husband and two children (7 and 10) are from Pittsburgh and just returned from the Bavaro Princess. Overall we had a very good trip and especially enjoyed the lush surroundings at the resort. Our suite was spacious, attractive, clean and great for a family (with the pull out bed and a spare cot in the suite, we practically had separate bedrooms). We had requested a room near the ocean and were placed way in the back by the spa. The staff did offer to move us mid-week, but we decided the hassle of moving was not worth making the change. All of the suites (including ours) had beautiful and lush tropical views.The water pressure and temperature in the suite was very inconsistent. We often had to delay showers because there was just a trickle of cold water in the shower. We found the maid service to be good and left small gifts (dollar store soaps, lotions, etc.) and dollar bills for the maids with notes.The resort grounds, beach and pool at the Bavaro are beautiful. We had a great time swimming, boogie boarding, banana and paddle boat riding, playing in the sand and enjoying the large, clean pool. We met lots of interesting and fun people in the pool area, many from other countries (we're guessing that only about 30% of the guests at the Bavaro were American). We also loved walking for miles on the beach, visiting the small shops (be prepard to agressively bargin) and seeing the other area resorts. The wildlife areas on the resort are attractive and interesting as well.We found the staff and most of the Dominican people to be plesant, genuinely humble, and courteous. A smile, a few words of broken Spanish, and perhaps a dollar bill go a very long way with the staff. A few of the staff members would hug me when they saw me simply because I made the extra effort to know their name and ask about their families. The food and service at the Bavaro was okay. This resort IS NOT the place for food snobs! While the buffets do offer a variety of choices, and we could always find something to eat, many of the buffet choices are unusual and the food is often served cold or at room temperature (even if you arrive early). We were not thrilled with repetitive choices like squid, liver, mysterious warm lunch meats and cheeses, and frightening black sausages. The freshly prepared foods (pasta, waffle and omlet bar for example) and fruits seemed the safest and best bets. The pizza and burgers take some getting used to. On a humorous note, we made more friends by bringing along a bottle of Heinz ketchup (a tip I learned from a previous post) to meals than you can ever imagine (their ketchup is some kind of strange dark barbecue sauce). We also ate at three of the restaurants and didn't find any of them to be exceptional. The food and service in general was hit or miss. If you travel with Apple Vacations, be sure to attend the welcome session. We signed up for all of our restaurant dinners at that time which was a huge help and saved time waiting in a line each morning for reservations. Sometimes the resort staff was quite attentive, but we often had to go in search of drinks at meals or wait in long lines at the bars.During our visit we all (like many guests we talked to) had various forms of mild stomach problems that fortunately were not severe, yet annoying. I'm glad I packed extra Pepto!We did try the Outback Safari one day and would highly recommend it. It was educational, interesting and lots of fun.Overall we had a very good trip. I'd be happy to hear from past/future Bavaro guests.CarolJohnson46@msn.com

<Content>Food Poisoning -- March 1-8th, 2006 My husband and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess the first week of March 2006. To qualify my statements, I have travelled and stayed in resorts in the following locations: Mazatlan, Puerta Vallarta, Cancun, Jamaica, Cuba, and Costa Rica prior to this trip.Pool: nice, big and lots of shade to get out of the sunBeach: One of the nicest I have ever stepped foot on. We walked for miles along the beach each day and people watched others walking by. Bavaro had lots of chairs available but you had to be up at the crack of dawn if you wanted a big umbrella thingy to sit under. People reserved then with beach towels and didn't come back until mid-late morning. This usually happens at all resorts.Grounds: This property was beautifully manicured and well kept but HUGE. Trams come around quite frequently so this wasn't a big deal!Service: Poor. poor. poor. No one wants to help with anything. For example.......The front desk forgot to give us a lock for the safe so we called and asked that one be brought to us. We wanted to lock our valuables up. They told us that we would have to come all the way back to the front desk to get the lock and that one would not be available until the next day.Good luck on getting a drink if you don't have a dollar bill in your hand. The bartenders scan the bar for money and skip over everyone who is not showing the cash. And they will serve people that walk up beside you after you have been waiting for 10 minutes, if they have a dollar in their hands.Room: Spacious suites are well kept and clean. FOOD AND DRINK: POOR...... I didn't go with high expectation for food, but I was still disappointed. The best food I found was at the beach bar and found myself having a hamburger and fries every day. The food was generally bland and everything was luke warm, regardless of whether it was supposed to be hot or cold.My husband and I both got food poisioning our second last night when we ate at Bella Pasta. We both had the beef carpaccio as an appetizer and different main courses so there is the link. My husband woke up in the middle of the night and puked his guts out the next 24 hours along with hot and cold spells. And we both suffered from severe stomach cramping and 'the runs' for the following 10 days.We only drank bottled water and even brushed our teeth with bottled, so we know it was not from the water.We found the drinks to be watered down (not a huge deal), but the cocktails were sooooo sweet that we could not drink them. Stick to highballs and beer if you don't want your teeth to rot and fall out.OVERALL: I would recommend travelling to Punta Cana to everyone, but not this resort because of the poor food, drink and service. This is a 3-star resort in 5-star clothing!

<Content>Bad service and sick We returned from our 2 week stay on April 18/06. I have been sick from some sort of food poisining since April 14/06. I was layed up in bed for 1 day and was not able to eat for 2 days. We went with a group of 30 people and 6 of the 30 are suffering the same symtoms. They tell you that everything is washed with filtered water but is this really true? After about 4 days all the food starts to taste the same. The service in this resort is terrible. Our trip started with my 5 year olds suitcase not at the airport. When we got to the hotel, I asked the guy at the front desk if he could call the airport and see if anyone had turned in the suitcase. I told me to talk to my travel rep. This was fine except that the travel rep would not be there until the following morning. I told him this and he refused to call and pointed to a pay phone. I literally begged this guy to phone for me and all he could do was say use the pay phone. The following morning the bag showed up as it had been sent to Porta Plata, but not because of anyones help at the resort. One night we went to the lobby for supper. It was very busy, and after getting our plates we found that there was no tables open. After 5 mins, a table of 4 left. Our group was 4 adults and my 5 year old daughter. The table next to us was kind enough to give us 1 chair they were not using so my daughter could sit down. We put the cahir off the corner of the table and before she could even sit down the waitress came and pulled the chair away and said you can't sit 5 people at a 4 person table and put the chair back. I grabbed the chair back and set my daughter down. This waitress was MAD. She was talking to the other servers in spanish and pointing at us. So to not cause a seen, I put my daughter on lap for dinner and put the chair back. The waitress had removed her name tag so I could not get her name to complain. After dinner I tried to talk to a superviser to complain and after talking to 3 different people that could not understand my complaint I left. We ran into a language barrier problem quite a few times. It is suprising how little to no english some of them speak that work in a resort. All the bars are under staffed. You would sometimes wait 5 mins to get served and there was for the most part no hurry to get you your drinks. On a positive note we met a bartender on the first night by the name of Plinto. This guy was awesome. He took good care of us the whole trip and always had a smile on his face. He would go out of his way to make sure the kids had a slush and that he said hi to them each night. The resort is beautiful and is kept clean. You will not find a nicer ocean view and beach. The security on the beach and resort is good so you are not getting bothered buy peddlers all day. The rooms are spacious and clean. The kids club is good and they always seem to have something going on for the kids. I recomend this resort if you want a nice beach and resort. Do not go here if you are looking for good food or good service.

<Content>absolutly loved it! We stayed at the Bavaro Princess April 7-10 and had an amazing time. The beach is beautiful, the pool is amazing. We were a group of 19 and not a single person became ill during or after our stay. We tried the buffets-very good lots of variety. For dinner we ate at El Gaucho-Argentenian steak best I ever had , and Bella Pasta= so/so. The other times we ate at the buffets. I would recommend eating at the buffet at El Gaucho for breakfast or lunch and sit on the patio, the view is amazing. We found the staff to be very friendly and accomidating. WE were always greeted with a smile and hola. They did appreciate when you attempted to say a few words in Spanish (i'm sure they got a kick out of my attemps to speak to them). Most of the resturant staff does not speak English, but pointing to the menu usually got the job done.Our room was outdated and had a musty smell, but after 24 hours the smell wasn't even noticed. Our room was always stocked with beer,water and diet 'light. Always very clean. WE did have ants on our shelf above the bed but it's to be expected in the area.We took the snorkling trip and it was the highlight of our trip. Swimming with sharks! The staff on the boat were very entertaining and it was just a great time with wonderful scenery.Overall I would give an excellent rating. If they could update the rooms it would be the perfect place. We plan on returning as soon as possible.Oh= one hint. there are no wash/face cloths provided and they don't even have them at the resort. We took a few of our own (old ones) and tossed them on the last day. Some of the other members of our group found it hard not to have a small cloth for face washing.feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions.

<Content>Review for the English People!!! I promised myself before I went on holiday that I would not come back and write a huge review - but needs must. The reviews for this hotel are almost exclusively from the US and Canada so I thought i would add a more European view for the people who have booked an might be put off by a lot of the neagtive comments!There are good and bad with all nationalities I'm sure, and it was 'spring break' at the time but we did witness some apalling behaviour by teenagers, including jumping all over the furniture, walking in the fountains in the reception area, dropping food all over the floor and just leaving it for someone else to clear up, and generally walking around like the world owed them a living - I stress at this point that this seemed to be a minority and equally there were some horrible European children as well (you don't throw stones at the flamingos!)I know spring break might be a time for fun but a lot of other people have come a long way for a relaxing holiday so a little bit of consideration would go a long way. I didn't realise about the spring break thing so to be fair I would probably just avoid it, so the kids can have their fun and I can have my quiet.I agree totally with some of the comments in previous reviews - a lot of the negatives are things that with a bit of foresight people could have avoided. It is also true that people are more inclined to write a negative review than a positive.Firstly we were in room 266 which was a ground floor suite in the middle of the resort (with no musty smell and no insect problems!)- and was a pleasant 5-10 minute walk to both the beach and the reception area. Even if you had to walk the full length of the resort it doesn't take too long, but may get a bit hot during the middle of the day. The decor was carribean stylie (bright colours and wicker furniture) - it wasn't offensive at all. They recommend you keep the doors shut while you have the air conditioning on as the humidity coming in from outside is what makes the rooms damp but we still saw a lot of people sitting outside with the doors wide open- the cause of slight mustiness me thinks?!We didn't get lost - when we checked in they gave us all details of restaurants, activities, dress codes, water drinking, pool towels and a map then told us where to get the bus, so finding our way around was not a problem.The grounds were beautiful as was the beach, and all were spotless. The ground staff seem to work constantly to keep the whole place tidy. After the third day i have to admit to being on the beach at 7.30 to get an umberella. The sunbeds are in plentiful supply and there is always shade under the palms but after a 'burning' incident on the first day the more shade the better at around midday! I apologise unreservedly to anyone I offended, teenage boy or otherwise) but I was one of the evil hussies sunbathing topless, but we did seem to be clustered at the far end away from most people and it is the norm in Europe.The food was fine and I think most people know not to drink the water when you go on holiday unless you are specifically told it is safe to drink. If you go to a gourmet Dominican restaurant I don't think you can expect it to be exactly like the equivalent at home, especially when they are all included. El Gaucho did good steaks, Bella Pasta did good pasta and the service was great in both. We did try Chopin and I have to agree it was a let down (lasagne and battered'english style'fish doesn't constitute a meal) but we put it down to experience and didn't go back. At the buffet you could get virtually anything you wanted, they would cook fish, steak, pasta etc to order so you can always find something- mmmm chips and gravy!I would like to know what the people who were ill ate, as I saw some people with huge plates of seafood and they following it with equally enormous plates of fresh fruit. This is obviously a healthy diet but how many of those people would eat that much of either in a normal day? (Own up - do you eat your 5 portions a day?) Plus it was all washed down with copious amounts of beer/cocktails. (Compare it to the morning after a heavy night out on the beer followed by a burger from the van outside the club - does your stomach feel great then?!)The reservations for the restaurants is a bit hectic but it was a busy time at the resort - even so when you are in a queue for 30 mins with a board clearly displaying what times are available surely you can make your mind up by the time you get to the front! - It seems not.Buses can also be a bit pushy-shovey, they could probably improve the queuing system for that. I saw a couple of times older guests, people with walking sticks and people with small children trying desparately to get a seat and being pushed out of the way - surely its just a case of manners (or do i sound a bit English now?!)We found service at the bar to be fine without tipping. The staff are very busy and they do serve people in turn when they get to the bar - except of course when people just shout at them, as though they are in some way backward, because they expect to have better service- some people just can't be patient. Language is not a problem either. I will admit to not knowing any spanish other than 'hola!', but you learn quickly and if you have to ask in English they appreciate it i you ask what it is in Spanish for next time. A 'hola!' to everyone passing always gets one back.Cleaning of the room was good, always fresh towels, flowers by the sink and for once the shower was quite powerful (again maybe we have lower epectations but 2 weeks self catering in Greece or toilets in France prepare you for anything!)A word of warning though - beware of the Royal Club reps who wait outside of the buffet restarant in the morning. They will promise you the moon on a stick if you go to Licey with them for 'just a minute'- they may also lay on the emotional blackmail regarding their $10 commission. We got sick of the hassle and went under the promise of some shopping vouchers which we did not recieve and were stuck for over 2 precious sunbathing hours! (What they are trying to sell you costs about $15,000 in total - like i have that sort of money lying about!)They were very upset when we told them we could fly to europe for 拢10 return on Ryanair - that messes up their pitch a bit.All in all if you maintain a sense of humour (people spotting in the lobby area is fun!), take plenty of high factor sun screen and give the due respect to the hardworking staff then you will have a very enjoyable holiday. We would definatly go back, just maybe not at spring break!

Puleeze!!! my husband and i along with our 17 year old daughter (and her friend) stayed here 9 april thru 16 april. we've been to AI's before and never have we experienced such lame service.when we arrived on sunday afternoon(we booked thru apple), our transfer from the airport went smoothly. got to the resort and found the staff to be like they didn't want to be there. we had 2 separate suites (1 for the teens and one for us). the rooms were nice size and lots of drawer and closet space but they look like they need some refurbishing (and they smell moldy). the location of our suite was in the middle of the resort (building 15) which was good because it was a 3 minute walk to the pool/beach and 7 minute walk to the lobby. we're new yorkers so we love the walking anway. however, you feel like you are always on guard because of the trams and other various vehicles constantly whizzing by. it was really annoying actually.had dinner at the lobby buffet the first night. it was nasty. we weren't expecting much but the food was gross. even our daughter and her friend found the food nausiating (and they'll eat anything).the next morning we slept in and got to the pool at 11AM only to find that there were no towels left. huh? the towel lady (who was moody and rude) said to come back in 15 minutes. this 15 minute ritual went on for over 2 hours when we finally got our towels. of course there were no chairs (even without the palapas) at the pool and none at the beach.the next morning we got out to the pool by 7:30 AM so we could claim our spot under the palapas. then on to the reservation for dinner line back at the lobby. by the time we got there the line was huge. of course by the time we got to the man taking the reservations (who was also in a bad mood) there were no reservations left for that day and only a 10PM at the asian restaurant (which was lousy and the service worse) for the following day. oh, and whatever reservation/seating you do get, take note of all of the EMPTY tables around you. it's a lousy system. the only restaurant that we tolerated was chopin which is a buffet (much better than lobby buffet which isn't saying much). we preferred buffet style becuase the service in all of the other restaurants was below par.boy, were we happy that we didn't pay the extra $30/day for the platinum card. for what? pre-booked reservations for lousy restaurants and service. oh, by the way, the only restaurant that was ALWAYS available was LICEY -- but you have to pay for that!!! like $46 per person. give me a break. apparently, no one ever went!the maids. maybe we just hit a bad week. we tipped every day and i even brought some new sealed beauty products from home and left it for her. one day we came back to the room at 3:30 and it wasn't made up. another day, we were very obviously out of TP and tissues (i actually put the empty box of tissues right near the sink for a clue) and when we came back to the room, no TP and no tissues. fridge wasn't re-stocked either. later, when we were in the lobby, we mentioned it to someone at the information counter and he said to talk to the bad mood guy at the dinner reservation desk! we feel the place is managed very poorly (except the grounds are kept beautiful). the food is lousy (except for the pineapple and the passion fruit). the service is sub-standard and we were very happy to return to NYC!this is far from a 5 star or as apple vacations rates it 5 apples. don't go here!!

<Content>Paradise Found We just returned from our 20th anniversary from Punta Cana. It was so exotic with lush greenery everywhere. We loved that there were no high rise condo areas, and the absolute cleanliness of our resort. The finest sand we found parallel to the Grand Cayman areas. The ocean was turquoise blue and shallow to great width. The Princess offers many restaurants to eat in. If you are picky you will still find things to eat, and if you aren't a picky eater you will be in heaven with the assorted foods. The rooms are just okay, nothing exciting to write home about and yet clean. There are no washclothes there so you will need to take those if you go. The language barrier is difficult sometimes, but they always come through with what you are trying to get. The lobby bar and the bar located in the El Gaucho area we found to be the best drinks and the best service!! The piano/lobby bar is a great relaxing place waiting for supper at night. It is always breezy, and not stagnant here so you might want to bring a jacket if you get chilly being out in the sun all day. If you have older boys like teenage and above it is a little unsettling for a family trip only because of the toplessness on the beach. Our sons are at an impressionable age that we didn't feel that would be a comfortable vacation time. You do have to pay a $10.00 visitor fee as you enter the airport which is really silly because they collect your ticket within 10 feet of when you pay. Just another way to make money in their govt. Bartering downtown isn't as cheap as in Mexico and Jamaica, but they do wear down. The resorts are very spread out so you definitely want to bring walking shoes although the transportation is easy to get if you wait a while. We recommend it highly, if you are a honeymooner, it was a great getaway. We loved it and want to go back!!!!

<Content>enjoyable My wife and I went to the Bavaro Princess with our two children, ages 7 and 10 from April 1to April 14. Overall, we were very pleased. Our room was a good size and with the steps up to the bedroom, there was a sense of division. However, the room was dated with old furniture, the handle on the shower needed fixing and my wife had a shock from one of the lamps. The maids did a good job cleaning. The grounds were incredible and added a lot to the stay. The buffet restaurant was excellent and we had a lot of variety,although my wife did get ill the second day. We did not eat at any of the restaurants because we did not want to line up at 7:30 am and wait for a long time to make a reservation.This seems to be a very inefficient way of doing things and we heard a number of complaints about this. The service was excellent at all locations and the staff was extremely friendly. We went on the Bavaro Runners, which cost $240.00US. The guide was very good, but we were gone for 9 hours, much of it on very bad roads. There were stops at cigar stores, etc., but it was obvious it was a highly commercialized venture. Overall, we would go back, but we are concerned about the food and when we go to Punta Cana at Christmas, we are going to try some place newer without so many reports on food problems.

<Content>Tips and pointers - go prepared and you'll have a great time!!! I had read this site every day prior to departure and gained some valuable insight on what to be prepared for. I hope my review will help you. After being there, I realize all of the negative posters could have resolved or prevented their problems had they been prepared.BACKGROUND:I travelled with my wife and 2 kids (12 and 8) as part of a group (33 total). The kids in the group ranged from age 8-15. We were there 4/6/06-4/14/06 Our travel agent was part of our group and I mention that as a bonus. Read on.FOOD/RESTAURANTS/RESERVATIONS:First and foremost, the food is what it is. If the most important item on your vacation is having great food, forget it. You've set too high an expectation. The food is fine and there are plenty of options at every meal. Hispaniola (main lobby) is the best buffet option for breakfast, but location wins out for Gaucho, McPrincess, or Bella Pasta for lunch. Since they are right next to the pool and beach, we found it too inconvenient to go to the main lobby for lunch, not to mention you would have to adhere to the dress code of no bathing suits there.The restaurants give you options for dinner, although they are set menus. You must have a reservation and the only choices are 7:00, 8:30, or 10:00p If travelling with kids, you are likely to want the 7p time. Gaucho, Sakura, and Bella Pasta were all okay while Pescodor was below average. Our family ended up going to Hispaniola AFTER our meal at Pescodor, because we barely ate anything while there.Our agent was able to PRE-ARRANGE our reservations prior to our arrival. This was a huge bonus because we never had to get up early to get in line. If we had had to get up each day for reservations, we may have just settled for the buffets each night. You may want to check and see if you can get reservations before you go. Also, while Chopin is a reservation only restaurant, it is a buffet. We noticed during our 7p reservation that there were few other patrons and they never asked us for our reservation. We mentioned this to a couple we met and they told us the next day that they were able to walk up at 7p and got in without a problem. Please note, however, this might not work at the 8:30 seating since they have a special piano performance at that time. I heard it was popular.None of my family got sick during our stay. I learned long ago that when travelling the Caribbean, take Pepto Bismol tablets each morning even if you don't feel like you need it. It worked for us. We drank the water they served at meals, but used bottled water in our rooms. BARS:What can you say about all the booze you want? We saw no reason to upgrade to Platinum, but that is your call. I will mention that I saw complaints about slow service and I observed first-hand that they get slow because they get overwhelmed with work. I never once saw a bartender take a break or slow down. They generally tried to get the beer, soda, and highball orders out quickly while the frozen/blended/fruity drinks took longer. My tip would be to order 2 at time (worked for me). I also recommend getting to know the bartenders a bit. Tipping, speaking Spanish, and being friendly to them obviously points them in your direction a bit better. I did not tip every time and can't say their attitude towards me was any different than when I did. Most people agreed that a generous tip in the beginning gave you good graces the whole time through. These people DESERVE the tips they make. I saw a few of my favorite bartenders, Carmen and Reuben, leaving the resort after duty and they were just as friendly to me then.ROOM LOCATION:To clarify, there are junior suites located soley in a 2 story hotel complex near the main lobby. These suites are only close to the lobby and the spa/fitness center.The remainder of the suites are located throughout the resort and are 4 suites to a building. Depending on YOUR preferences, some buildings are more convenient than others. Our building was in the middle of the resort and was an easy walk to EVERYTHING. Others in our group had buildings next to the beach and pool, which was great for those reasons. However, they relied on the trams to get them to the main lobby or tennis courts. My experience was that more times than not, the trams took longer when factoring the wait, the stops, and whether you had to wait for one with empty seats, than it did to walk. If your room is centrally located, then you have the option of walking or riding. My suggestion is for them to show you the map before they assign your villa and you decide what will work best for you. Other than the presidential suite, all villas are identical. I had read some complaints of a septic smell. I'm pretty sure that what they smelled was the mangrove swamp after a rainfall. We had a steady rain one day and I smelled an odor near the swamp. It was probably the smell of the stagnant water that had been stirred up.BEACH/POOL/PALAPASThe beach and pool are spectacular. Both have many palapas (umbrellas) but these get claimed very quickly. I will also comment that the claims seem to be territorial, meaning certain nationalities seem to make it their priority to claim a group of palapas. There is a fine art to how early you get up to claim one. Some people told me that some put their stuff under one at night AFTER the grounds crew has gone through (my nightly intake of rum was much too important to stoop that low). In any event, you run the risk of your stuff not being there (the resort charges 15usd per towel) and you might not be sure who your neighbors are. The resort issues a statement in their booklet in the room that any palapa not occupied in 30 minutes is fair game but I strongly encourage you to have power in numbers if you take that route.After a few days, you will begin to see a pattern of the territories forming on the beach and you can simply choose your locations accordingly. Note: topless sunbathing is a hint. ACTIVITIESWe found that you can get some of the same activities thru different vendors on the resort. For instance, several in our group went snorkeling on a tour booked by Apple (I think). They rode on a bus to and from the resort and then got on a boat to go out to the reef. It cost them 65usd and they were gone 1/2 a day. My family, on the other hand, booked our tour from the watersports shed. We left directly from the beach and were gone 1.5 hrs (of which 15 mins was travel time). Our cost was 23usd and it sounded like our ultimate snorkelling result was the same. In fact, it sounded like we both ended up at the same reef.STAFF ATTITUDESI had read a few comments about the staff being rude. We did not witness a single incident of this. We found the Dominicans to be very fun, loving, caring people. My kids are in a Spanish Immersion program in school and had a grand time speaking with the staff. The staff, in turn, were thrilled to see 2 American kids speaking THEIR language. They also appreciate the adults who make an effort.We took school supplies for our maid and she seemed to be thrilled to get them (we verified that she has school-aged kids). In retrospect, I wish I had taken my garage full of used and unused sporting goods. The Dominicans love baseball and any old equipment, cleats, or clothing would go over great with them. I imagine soccer equipment would too.One quirky thing happened while we were shopping. One of the vendors was obsessed with a pair of Nike's one of our men was wearing and he wanted to buy them. Perhaps you can take some things to barter with.GUEST ATTITUDESI'm NOT trying to start anything here, but I do think it is important to prepare you for this. You are in a foreign country and you will be among many nationalities. Parts of our group experienced some hostility that was unprovoked and my children reported they were rebuffed for no other reason than because they were American. My wife and I witnessed an altercation involving 2 nationalities of which neither were American (it was clearly from having too much to drink), so it's not just us against them. However, there is no question that some tension can exist. How you deal with it is up to you.OVERALL EXPERIENCEMy family had a blast and I would highly recommend it for anyone that likes to set their own pace. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for infants or toddlers and for anyone that struggles getting around.My final thought is to remember that most people who had a POSITIVE experience will not bother to write a review, while almost all who had a NEGATIVE one will. Do the math. There were at least 1000 people there while we were. How many negative responses do you see during that time?Have fun, muchachos!!!

<Content>Wouldn't go back. We stayed at the Bavaro Princess from March 12 thru March 17th. We went to the resort knowing that there were bad reviews but wanted to be optimistic.We didn't get to the resort until 8:30 pm so there was no Apple Rep there to great us. We checked in and found that our room was close to the beach. But found it was VERY far away from the lobby. We received our packet of info and set off to our room. There was no room on the tram so we walked, only to find out we weren't given room key cards in our packet. So we had to walk all the way back to the lobby and receive our key cards. Once again we had to walk back to the room. By this time I had a bleeding blister on my foot and once we got close to our room I slipped off the side of the walkway and twisted my ankle! I was able to walk it off the rest of the week - no Dr. exam. We found the room to smell very musty ( room 665 ) and realized that the fresh paint was only hiding a mold problem. The cold water in the sink was turned off completey. We found out that you can't drink the water at all, but only the next morning and after my husband turned the water back on so we could brush our teeth and get ready for bed, etc... We had to use the gallon water they put in the frig all week to brush our teeth and in the evenings, wash our faces in the shower/tub. Make sure and check that your water bottles are sealed shut when you get them. We had the feeling that they reused the bottles. Some of ours weren't sealed and appeared to have been opened. We exchanged them for different ones.The beach and resort was beautiful but they have major septic issues. Many times the toilets in the lobby were backed up and I mean it had been quite a while since they had been flushed!!! About the 4th day there, there was pooled water in our area and the smell of septic was very strong. The food was pretty bad. Everything was toom temp at best. We couldn't understand why they have issues with keeping the food warm since they feed so many people it should be easy enough. The scrambled eggs were runny, the bacon cold and raw. I had to spit out a bite of sausage that was done, but horrible - and we are from Wisconsin and know our sausage and brats!! Even the pork and beef were bad. If you stuck to fruit or the chicken you could survive the week. We went to the Chopin only to find it was the same buffet food we had at lunch. The only difference was the boat singer. It didn't make up for the bad food. They sure did pour the wine and drinks to us though. We figured if the kept us drunk then we'd eat anything. No thank you.We also ate at the Gaucho. My husband had the chicken but I tried the beef. It was horrible. The Asian restaurant ( can't remember the name right now ) seemed to be ok but I thought I'd try the terriaki pork this time. It was pretty bad as well. Husband had the chicken again. We met a couple and their 2 kids from Canada. They waited 2 hrs at the Asian rest. for their main course and finally walked out!! The seafood restaurant was ok but they over cook the lobster. Still with some drawn butter it was probably the best meal we had.The coffee was very good. We didn't have the platinum package so all we could have for drinks was the tap beer ( not bad ) and Dominican liquor ( not bad either ) but any top rail stuff was going to be added to your bill in the end. The bottled beer in the frig was very skunky tasting and smelling. If you got past the first one then you could keep drinking them. Once again - we are from Wisconsin and know our beer!We went through the mangrove a few times. It was pretty. Walking through the resort can be dangerous as the trams come past quickly and you have to step off the walkway, which in some spots is about 6 inches above the grass below. ( that's how I twisted my ankle. ) By Thursday we noticed we weren't given a fresh gallon of drinking water and ended up getting more bottles of water through out the day so we could make some coffee and brush our teeth the next day. They were completey out of towels on Thursday too!! How does that happen at nice resort.Overall the resort is very nice looking but that doesn't help when they have major issues keeping the thing running.This was our first time at an all inclusive resort and were turned off by this place.

<Content>Wonderfull 1st time trip !!! We got back from the Bavaro Princess on Monday Apr 10th and I have to say, it was amazing and the weather was great dispite the internet weather forcast...We went a group of 16 people. My friend got married there and it was beautiful... The resort was very beautiful, very clean, staff was friendly and food was not bad at all. We didn't try all the restaurants A la Carte, but we ate at Licey (food was excellent), Chopin(Asian buffet, not bad) and El Gaucho(steak house, good).Our room was spotless, the maid was very kind and helped us if we needed anything even though she couldn't speak English, we could still communicate well. No one was sick, except my husband, but that was because of too much drinking.I think the people who post bad reviews for this resort are people who are very hard to please and difficult. The staff works so hard to keep a pleasant environment and the entertainment was great, we even got dancing lessons.If you want to go on a trip, I recommend this resort to anyone.

<Content>We loved the Bavaro! I meant to write a short review, but it ended up being long. There is so much to tell!We stayed at the Bavaro Princess April 1-8. We read a lot of reviews before we went and were concerned about the reports of food poisoning. We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the resort and the grounds. We had a room close to the beach #311. It was really spacious, the AC worked great, and the patio was very nice. Tip: Leave a tip on your pillow for the maid. ($1 or $2) If you want your fridge stocked with sodas and beer, leave an empty bottle on the pillow and the maid will know what you need. (Fridge is located in a cabinet under the TV. It took us ages to find it!) Our overall experience here was good and we would come back.Because of the negative reviews of the food, we decided to be very careful of our choices. We mostly ate at the buffets, El Gaucho and Hispanolia, because we never seemed to be at the right place or the right time to make a reservation for the other restaurants. We thought the food at these two buffets was pretty decent. Mostly ate fish, vegetables and fresh fruit. We did NOT get sick, which was our main concern. Tip: I took 2 immodium D pills every morning to prevent tourista. My husband was moreadventuresome and did not take anything. He did try the beef and the chicken and they were ok. If you're a big steak eater, don't come here. The beef is not like we are used to in North America. Also, if you are looking for a gourmet food experience this is not the resort for you. If you like fresh food, simply prepared, you'll get it here. This is a different country and culture, and you have to keep an open mind. The hot dogs at McPrincess are not like you are used to, but the fries are pretty good! The only menu restaurant we went to was Bella Pasta, and I was very disappointed. I suggest you skip this one! I ordered the cheese ravioli, and sent it back twice because they didn't get my order right. The tomato sauce on the appetizer, spinach and cheese crepes, tasted like it came out of a can of spaghettios. The beach is fantastic! Makes up for the food. If you get there by 10:00am, you're too late to get any of the palapas with shade. We found this out the hard way! Guests will get up early and put their towels on a chair, then leave and come back much later. There is no fast rule about reserving the palapas. First come, first serve. TIP: On our last night before we left, we went down to a palapa and put 2 brightly colored cheap t-shirts on two chairs around 9:00pm after everyone had left the beach. We got there the next morning around 9:00am and they were still there, so we had the best spot on the beach close to the bar. :) TIP: Tip the bartenders if you want good drinks. These guys appreciate please and thank you. They work so hard and we did see some rude guests. The native language is Spanish. Brush up on a few conversational phrases, and you will get much better service. The Dominican people are really great and appreciate it if you can converse with them in their language. TIP: Take LOTS of $1.00 bills for tips. You will need them from the time you step off your plane. The currency is pesos, but we used dollars the whole time. The Castle Casino looks really cheesy from the outside, but it's nice inside. We looked around but decided not to gamble. My husband played golf at Punta Cana Golf Resort and it was a great experience.If you want to shop, skip the resort gift shops-they are way over priced. There is a mall a block or two from the hotel that you can buy all your souvenirs and you can bargain. Larimar is the local stone for jewelry. I bought a necklace they were asking $365 for and we bargained down to $100. TIP: Take lots of sunblock and chapstick. A tube of chapstick that costs 99 cents here is $6.00 in the gift shop. I heard that sunblock is $27.00, but I didn't verify.All of the water we drank was purified in the restaurants. Also, the rooms are stocked with gallon jugs of water and replaced as you need them. If you take one excursion-take the Catamaran trip to Saona island. It is well worth the $80 per person. It's an all day trip and includes snacks, lunch and drinks. We have some great photos of that day!The only reason I didn't rate this resort as a 5 star is because of the the food and the rooms need some updating. The resort is huge, 900 rooms, so if you figure they are feeding a minimum of 1800 people for every meal, they do pretty good.We had a great time here and want to go back someday.

<Content>Loved It!!!  I LOVED THIS RESORT! It was beautiful. The pool area was amazing and the beach was just as nice. The restaurants were great to eat at just make sure you get reservations before ten because they then you will be very tired. The buffet was a great place to eat even if you don't get reservations at some place. Just be careful what you eat, it seemed it didn't matter what we ate everyone in my group got sick. So just be aware of that fact. All the workers there are really really nice and friendly. Though they don't all know english. Everyone should go to this resort. I loved it. Make sure you go on a day trip. I did the outback safari and the snorkeling on...it was amazing!

<Content>Would go back We stayed at the Bavaro Princess from April 1 to April 7, 2006 (2 adults + 2 kids aged 4 years old and 16 months). We traveled with Sunwing from Ottawa.I don鈥檛 want to review everything for this resort, just some precisions and advices. Yes the beach and the ground are beautiful. You have to walk about 10-12 minutes from the lobby to the beach. Junior suite vs. Regular Suite: When I booked in October, I did not notice the difference between Junior Suite (in the hotel section near the lobby) and regular Suite (in bungalows all over the resort). I booked a Junior suite and I realized later the difference. As other member did, I sent an email a few days before our departure to request a room in the bungalows not too far from the beach. When we got there at 2:00 am on April 1st, I got a Junior suite. I then asked for an upgrade and I was told there was only one suite available in the bungalows. I checked the suite (building #81) and it looked ok (clean + big). It was only 1-2 minutes from the beach. I paid $120 US for this upgrade. If you like the beach, do not take a junior suite. Check the map of the resort when you get our room number and decide if you want an upgrade.Food: It was my fourth visit to an all-inclusive in the Caribbean and my third in DR (once in Puerto Plata 鈥?Riu Merengue and once in Punta Cana 鈥?Fiesta Bavaro known as the Palladium now). I thought the food was ok, average to above average compare to the other 2 hotels in DR. We had breakfast and lunch at the beach (not very good and nice view). There are 2 buffets for breakfast and lunch at the beach. El gaucho opens for lunch at 1:00pm, but at 1:15 pm, there are long line-ups. You should get there before 1:00 (it opens at 1:00, but you may get food before 1:00pm). The other buffet ah the beach is Bella Pasta (no line-up here at anytime). They鈥檙e both located in the same building. You can have breakfast and lunch outside just next to the ocean. None of us got sick and we did not meet anyone who got sick. The food at the main buffet (Hispaniola) is better. We tried the Chopin (buffet) and the food was good also.Beach: The towel game takes place every morning and I noted that after 8:00 am and 8:30am, it may be difficult to get a pallapas. Remember there are idiots who try to reserve a chair the night before!! Waves in front of the Paradisus hotel (on your left when facing the ocean and just next to the Water sports center) are much bigger and perfect for boggie board. Overall, the service is sometimes excellent, sometimes mediocre (both restaurants and room service). Still, we really enjoyed this place. I would recommend this hotel to my best friend.

<Content>amazing place I was at bavaro with my family the same time that the person that wrote the negative review.We had 2 kids with us ages 10 and 7 and my wife and I.You have to watch what you eat but nothing was wrong.After reading about all the people that got food poisoning in Feb. March we were a little concerned. But it turned out to be a fantastic vacation. The Drinks were great, the only food we didn't enjoy was at the seafood place, I would by pass that and try everything else, cause it was all great. Now the people that worked at the hotel were amazing especially the staff at the Platinum lounge, BONUS NACHOS was a funny saying that we got into and kept it going for the week and we all got a laugh out of it even the spanish speaking people working the lounge. We got a babysitter one night and for 5 bucks a kid we had a great time for a couple of hours int he casino as did our great friends from winnipeg who we chummed around with all week. The beach was amazing but we had alot of rain, but what can you do it is mother nature. Make the best of it.Go shopping down on the beach it is fun they can only go so far so if you stay close to the water they can't harass you. Our best times in the lounge were laughing with jorge they treat you like friends not customers. Would we go back, Maybe not but not because of anything wrong just like to try different places that arent so pushy when your shopping for souveniers. But enjoy it because all the negative comments from people are just people with pickle stuck up the rearend cause it is a fantastic place.

<Content>Vacation of a lifetime! I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from April 1-April 8 and here is my review:FLIGHT: We took USA 3000 and it was good. The food wasn't that great but it was a pretty smooth ride with a few bumps here and there. Getting through immigration wasn't too bad. The way back was very interesting! There is a reason they get you to the airport 2 hours early. The line you stand in to go through immigration practically wraps around the building! It is very hot so dress lightly!BUS TRIP TO HOTEL: Be prepared for a wild ride! The roads are very narrow and the bus driver does not drive slow! The apple representative on the bus was very friendly and helpful.HOTEL CHECK-IN: Very fast and friendly. They took our luggage up to our room and by the time we got there it was waiting for us in our room! ROOM: Awesome! We ended up with two twin beds but we asked the maid the next morning if she could put a king size sheet on there and it worked great! The mini bar is full of beer and pop. If you leave a note for the maid with a couple bucks asking for muchas cerveza's, she will stock your fridge with as much beer as she could! The coke tastes just fine. It is in the old fashion bottles. They also have sprite and diet coke. The coffee maker works, we used it one time. The shower is roomy. The water pressure goes down as it gets around 5-6pm. Naturally, everyone is showering for dinner! The hairdryer works really good and there is space everywhere! Plenty of dressers and closet space. The tv works good although we barely watched it. Some stations are in spanish and there are a few english movie channels. When we first came in there was a slight musty smell that quickly went away. The a/c was great! And it was very quiet at night.FOOD: I have no idea why everyone was complaining about the food or getting sick. We ate mostly at the La Hispanola, the main restaurant. We had excellent breakfast, lunch and dinner. The eggs are the best ever! And you have to try the donuts with the white icing. Never had anything like it! They have fresh squeezed juice like papaya, watermelon, pineapple and mango. It was great! They have a wide selection of tropical fruit. Just avoid the fruits that have skins on them. If you can peel it, you are good to go! All the food was hot and fresh. For lunch and dinner, if you wanted pasta, they had a pasta station where you can pick what you want and they saute it for you then add the sauce. It was really good! The breads were very good and the desserts were good as well. We were able to get into Chopin one night for dinner. They had a really good buffet and you gotta check the piano player who comes down the water by your table! Really neat! It is very hard to get reservations. If you get to the main lobby at 7:30 am you can wait in line to get reservations. We didn't bother since the buffet had different choices every night. The coke is good. Sometimes it can be a little syrupy but most of the time it is just fine. Also, you must try the white rice. I have never had rice this good in my life. One night they had fajitas! The workers are all very friendly and do the best they can with english. It helps if you learn a little spanish. I remembered some from high school and it worked wonders! There is a buffet down by the beach which also has breakfast and lunch. But the food isn't bad if you get it as soon as they open. The eggs were cold but that was because they didn't have a heat lamp on. I prefer the bigger buffet. BARS: The swim up bar is great at the main pool! Nice and shady if you need a break from the sun. Reuben is the man! He makes great drinks! Try the coco loco! It is muy bien! The bar in the lobby is also great in the evening. They will give you the best drinks!BEACH/POOL: The beach is gorgeous! White sand, blue water! And you will see the occasional sun bather walking by! Stop by Scuba Caribe and check out what they have to offer! The main pool is real nice! Lots of room and there are lots of activities to do like water polo and even aerobics! There is a smaller pool by the front but I didn't try that out. There are plenty of seats and if you want chairs under the shade get there before 10! ACTIVITIES: We went on a snorkeling trip from Apple and it was awesome! 65 dollars a person for 1/2 day. You get to snorkel with stingrays and sharks and the boat entertainment is wonderful! My fiance went scuba diving because he is certified and he had a great time as well so if you got your certification, I recommend visiting scuba caribe to set up a trip.ENTERTAINMENT: The shows are wonderful! Everynight is a great show. There is a kids show that goes on every night, so if you have little kids, send them onstage, it is a blast! My favorite show was the Legends Show. It features mini performances of Grease, Cats, Phantom of the Opera as well as impersonaters of michael jackson among others. The LIon King show is really good as well! There are dancers who come out before the show and teach you how to dance. These guys and gals have some moves so don't be shy! SPA: Ok this is the best part of my vacation, except for my boyfriend proposing to me. I turned 30 on April 7, and I treated myself to a spa treatment. I recommend saving some extra $$ to get the total relaxion package for 95 dollars. You get 5 minutes in the steam room, then exfoliation rub, then jacuzzi tub for a while then an aromotherapy massage! Wonderful! I felt like a new woman!Overall this resort was awesome! There are peacocks and birds of all sorts running around. Check out the giant iguana tank. I had no complains what so ever for this trip. I never got sick one time from the food. I will say that your body will be out of whack due to being off schedule but you will adjust. The people are very nice and a simple hola brings a smile to their face. You have to go to this country with a positive outlook. The food is not what you eat back home and the people are not what you are accustomed too either. Take it all with a grain of salt and enjoy yourself! If anyone has any questions about this resort, feel free to email me at legalbeagle94@cox.netAdios!

<Content>Spotless resort!!! I didn't rate this vacation as excellent because it rained for two days solid and at the Princess, you have to walk outside for everything. The resort did provide umbrellas in each room. If you don't like to walk, this resort is not for you. From the lobby, which houses the main buffet and entertainment, to the beach is approximately a mile; from the suites to the beach it's half that. There are shuttles that run frequently and have scheduled stops. I didn't mind the walk because it was through plush greenery, and the area of the suites is very calming.The food in the buffet was above average. The food in the restaurants you had to make reservations in was excellent. The only drawback to making reservations is you have to be up at 8:00 AM and wait in line to make next day reservations, but it's like this at every resort I've stayed at.The suites are very spacious, clean, and quiet. I was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the whole resort. Even the bathrooms down by the beach were spotless.The bars. If you wanted alcohol in your drinks, you got alcohol. Boy, did you get alcohol. The drinks were great, as were the bartenders.Now, the beach. On the coast where the Princess is, I'd say the Princess has the biggest beach front, not only in length but also in depth. It was also very clean.We took one excursion and it was very easy to sign up and everything went according to the brochure. I know the resort doesn't have anything to do with that, but it was nice.All in all, this was a very good vacation and I would stay again at the Bavaro Princess.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised! Just got back from our trip and we were pleasantly surprised. The resort was beautiful, the rooms were clean and spacious, the beach was amazing, and the food was good.  We were only there for 5 days so the food never got tiresome, there was always something new to try. We tried El Pescador, Sakura, and Chopin. The service at El Pescador was a little shady (the head waiter had a very snooty attitude, but we made sure to only tip the 2 others that did most the work;this was so appreciated that we were treated like royalty by one of the guys for the remainder of the trip-you can't miss Enrigue's smile), but that was the only complaint we had about the service the entire time, I thought the lobster was pretty good. Sakura was great, the menu was very specific to this restaurant only so we knew we weren't getting the general buffet food. Chopin was beautiful, we sat right at the the pond so had front row seats for the piano boat. Sakura and Chopin had beautiful atmospheres, El Pescador seem more like a cafeteria.The rooms were great, with cute little patios off each room, but we felt sorry for the guests who did not get the bungalow style rooms. Bungalo 28 was a perfect location for us, centrally located.The drinks seemed a little watered down, but this is probably a good thing. The coco-loca is fabulous, but don't drink too many (coconut-based). If you are there on Thursday, definately check out the lobby at night (the local merchants come in and set up tables of their merchandise), they will start with very high prices, but you could probably purchase something at 50%.Definately would recomment the Bavaro Princess to friends and family!

<Content>Sports, Food, this review has it all! My wife and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess for 1 week, March 25 - April 1. We had only been on one trip to the carib before, which was the Bahamas Sandals. I went to the Dominican wanting to try something a little different and cheaper.General Health:We were a little worried after reading all of the negative reviews, but these probably helped us prepare for our trip. I did some research on the Health Canada website and went to see my doctor as recommended 6 weeks prior to travel. He gave us a prescription for Dukoral, which can provide increased resistance to E-coli and other bacterial infections. He also gave us a prescription for antibiotics should we encounter any鈥rrr problems. Don鈥檛 want to sound like a walking pin cushion, but shots for Hep A, B and Malaria are also recommended for the Dominican. Hey vacations, they can be fun and safe!Resort:Anyway, the Bavaro Princess was a very nice hotel / resort. All of the rooms are suites, located in 2 storey buildings, 4 per floor. The rooms were really interesting, terribly inefficient if you are a property manager, but as a tourist, they give a real sense of luxury. The bedrooms are elevated 2 feet above the lounge and kitchenette area. Each room has an outdoor patio (~ 15 square ft) which is actually the point of entry. The patio is a great place to sit and relax, especially if you get a bit of rain or want to get out of the sun. The grounds are beautiful and give a very relaxing atmosphere, 陆 floral delight, half jungle paradise. The BP is definitely not your typical hotel.Beach and Pool:The BP has by far the nicest beach of the surrounding hotels. We walked quite far on both sides and the beach seemed to be wider, cleaner and softer at the BP. There is a good swimming area roped off and the water is quite warm (many more swimmers than in the Bahamas). There are breakers about 300 ft off shore and usually smaller ones along the beach - this is great for kids and boogie boarding. The BP beach has loads of little palm shelter things, but unfortunately they get taken by greedy tourists by 8:30am. It鈥檚 quite pathetic really, people believe that because they put a beach towel down at 7am, they can just stroll down to the beach at 3pm and take their chairs. Come on people 鈥?share! If you aren鈥檛 part of the solution you are part of the problem. Here鈥檚 an idea, if you get a hut and see someone walking by, why not offer to share it with them鈥ou might even make a new friend. Each one easily fits 4 people or more and they are never more than 20% occupied, unless you count towels. The pool had the same problem, but was otherwise nice, very intricate and for the most part clean, although did get a bit gross by late afternoon.Food:The food was good, breakfast seemed to be the best of the buffets. The BP tries to have something a bit different at each meal: breakfast has the made to order omelet, lunch has the grilled pasta bar, and dinner has the fresh grill. This is a nice way to change things up to complement the buffet food. We ate mostly at the a la carte restaurants and found them to be fairly good. Sakura has by far the best presentation and atmosphere, but the food was a bit below par. The first and second course were great, but the main was a bit disappointing, seemed to be all cooked in the same sauce. El Goucho was actually our favourite鈥he sirloin and Argentinian steaks were very good, better than the meat at the buffets. The seafood restaurant was pretty good too, they actually changed their menu halfway through the week. The octopus starter was incredible! The Lobster was a bit mushy, almost doughy, but I heard that鈥檚 a carib thing, Lobster is just not the same as East Coast. I had the surf and turf, which had the same steak as El Goucho and a massive 8鈥? prawn鈥hrimp would be misleading!Sports:The sailing was fantastic, I was a little concerned about the breakers at first, but the staff assured me that as long as I signed the waiver everything would be fine ;) The sailing is literally half surfing, with swells up to 6 ft and breakers that you can power through, just have to steer clear of the shallow reefs 鈥?can鈥檛 begin to describe how much fun this is. I was a bit disappointed with the water sports staff, as I got the impression that they were a bit lazy. On some days there were other boats out and they would tell me there was either not enough wind or too much. Seemed to be fine once the other boats came in, I think they just didn鈥檛 want to rig another boat. I would also recommend you don鈥檛 pay the insurance until you are in the boat. I felt a little scammed one day because they told me to pay the $20 insurance, got me all signed in and then said there wasn鈥檛 enough wind 鈥?had to wait until tomorrow? We didn鈥檛 get to go snorkeling as it was too windy most of the week. Note: On windy days, take advantage of the sailing or boarding, otherwise book snorkeling and trips while you can. There is no snorkeling at the resort 鈥?they鈥檒l give you gear, but there is nothing accessible within the designated swim area.Day Trips:We only went off the resort once for the Wild Buggy Excursion. There is a sign posted for it down by the towel hut, but it鈥檚 not really advertised anywhere else. Note: If you ask about anything in the DR, the person will want to help you because everything is commissioned. We asked the horse trip guy about the buggy trip because he was in the booth next to it. Of course he has a friend who鈥檒l help us out if we pay cash and鈥his can be good because you鈥檒l get a good deal, but a bit risky if things don鈥檛 work out. Our trip was really fun. The buggies were really fast and as advertised we had loads of puddles and mud to bomb through. We also were surprised by how much we drove around the countryside, through the rice paddies and next to the mountains. We even stopped in several little villages (for shopping and drinks) as well as an awesome cave. Our buggy did break down twice and after buggy #3, we were relegated to a pickup truck until an ATV could be secured for the rest of the trip. The ATV was actually faster, but not as cool. Had we gone through the assigned hotel rep, we probably would have asked for a refund, but the trip was still really cool and we spent a good 3 hours + traveling the countryside. Not bad for $100, even if we had a few breakdowns.Conclusion:90% of the trip to Sandals for half the price 鈥?could fix a few small things but otherwise satisfied.

<Content>Great time! I went to the Bavaro Princess April 1-8. We had a great time. The weather was fantastic. The beach is gorgeous. Beautiful white sand. The resort is huge! And it's beautiful. I was very impressed at how nice the grounds are kept. The rooms are fine. Nothing too exciting, standard rooms. We went with SunWing and they have a special area of rooms near the lobby. There are lots of restaurants to choose from. Making reservations is a bit of a pain. We didn't go platinum but tried to once we got there but they were booked. The food is ok. We actually preferred the buffets. We had a fantastic time my only complaints would be that the a la carte restaurants were not as good as I had hoped and the service was very slow at the restaurants and bars. But overall, it was a great trip and we lucked out with fantastic weather.

<Content>Awsome Honeymoon We were at the Bavaro Princess in December 2005. It was above what we could have expected. The staff was very friendly. Grounds and rooms were very clean. The food was some of the best we have ever eaten. We are both 26 years old and found there to be lots of fun stuff to do within the resort and the entertainment was great. We have been to 5 star resorts the Mayan Riviera and Cancun and the Bavaro Princess in Punta Cana is our number one. We would go back without giving it a second thought.

<Content>Amazing holiday!!!!!!! please take time to read this review We had a great time at the Bavaro princess.POOL: the pool was lovely and clean. It was huge!! this pool is not like your average rectangle pool, it is a wierd shape which makes it look better. The water is always warm yet refreshing if you need to cool down.BEACH: what can i say BEAUTIFUL!! the white sand is lovely and the water is a clear blue. The kids loved the waves and were always renting out boogy boards which were alot of fun. every watersport is included in the all-inclusive package except those with moters. If you want to go kanooing, it is free but if you are certified then you MUST bring your cetificate with you beacause they will charge you $30 for a lesson of things you already know - same thing with sailing. I may just add that parrasailing is a must. it is worth every penny.ROOMS: rooms were cosy and clean. the mini bar was stocked daily with bear, pepsi, sprite ect.RESTERAUNTS: were all very nice, you never went hungery and most of the waiters were friendly and helpful. dont get angry if they dont speak engish and you cant understand them, remember you are in thier country. I loved the sceanery of chopin, try and book an 8:30 booking for chopin so you can see the piano show which is nice.El goucho was my favourite for food it was lovely! :DLOBBY: the lobby had lots of seatsand had a lovely pond in the middle with turtles and fish and parrots around the outside.we had a great holiday and i hope you do too.

<Content>nice place bad food I just got back from a seven night stay at the bavaro princess. The place is as nice as the pictures show. The beachis beautiful, the pools are huge and the rooms look just like the ads. show. That was the good part. now for the bad parts. The first thing that you notice after you see how nice the place is is the fact that you can't walk anywhere without getting run off of the pathways buy the constant parade of trams, service vehicles, and other workers who sem to be going somewhere in a hurry. Later you will realize the only thing this hotel is in a hurry to do is take your money. The hotel is large but there is no reason to have the constant traffic. If the guests can walk, which most of the time you have to even though there are trams, so could the help. The two stroke fuel they use also leaves an oily film everywhere that makes things slippery as ice. We met two people through the week that fell and seriously hurt themselfs, one of them went home in a wheelchair. Then there was the air conditioning in our room. The first day it didn't work, we told the hotel, they said it would be taken care of, somebody came i don't know what the did but it didn't work. wh were assured it was fixed but it did next to nothing the whole week. must of the time we left the door open because the outside air was cooler. Lastly and most importantly was the food. It was bad enough that the food tasted horrible and they had the exact same thing on the main buffet the whole week, but I got food poisoning too. No if wasn't the water like many poeple said. I only drank bottled water no tap. The problem is these people need to be introduced to some kind of safe food handling guidelines. Everything no matter if it is hot on cold food is at or near room temp. Then to top that the food sits until it gets eaten or the meal is over which can be five hours. at 85 degrees that's way too long. Then the ala cart restaraunts, they aren't truely made to order instead you just tell a waiter what you want and they get if off of a buffet for you. If you go take your own food. The people at this resort will really show you why this island is so poor. They are lazy and ignorant.

<Content>beautiful beach I read the reviews prior to traveling and I was worried with what we will find.My mother has a timeshare with Royal so she made the choice.We were a group of 7. 3 adults ,1 senior citizen and 3 children.Everyone found something to do,the staff was absolutely wonderful (you can tell they must rely on tips).The rooms are nice, clean and comfortable.The Beach is beautiful and the pool is nice and clean.Drinks and food are plenty.We were able to get reservations for all the restaurants.El Gaucho is their steak house,sirloin was tough but the Churrasco(skirt steak)was delicious.El Pescador is the seafood ,very slow service and the lobster was not cook properly.Desserts in general were poor.Sakura, Asian Bistro was excellent the service was fast and friendly and the food delicious.Chopin is a Buffet it was good specially the cook to order seafood.Breakfast and lunch were Buffet style good, specially for the children. The nightly shows were actually quite good and funny.

<Content>5 Apple Square Deal from Cleveland to Bavaro Princess This was our first time doing a 5 Apple Square Deal, and we were not disappointed. We traveled 3/18 thru 3/25/06.We received our hotel information from the Apple Rep at Cleveland Hopkins and everything went smoothly. We had plenty of time to contact our family and pass along our hotel information.We arrived at the Bavaro Princess late at night, so we didn't really get to see the grounds or beach until the next day. The beach was absolutely beautiful, everything I expected and wanted. The grounds were very clean as the grounds keepers seemed to always be working. I read numerous reviews prior to our trip and we have no disappointments. We will definately do an Apple Square Deal again.We are seasoned travelers and going to a place like Punta Cana the beach, weather, drinks,  friends are the most important factors. There is so much in the way of food to choose from, you definately don't go hungry. Our room was great, I wrote a note the first day we were there and asked that we always had 6 beers in our refrigerator, and everyday we did. Leaving a $1 or 2 here and there really is appreciated. We always tried to tip the maids, bartenders and waiters. Although I must say, not a lot of people left tips.Barb  Bob of Wadsworth....if you are reading this review, we meant to exchange addresses  phone numbers. If for some reason you are reading this review, please reply. It would be nice to stay in touch.All in all ~ don't hesitate to save some extra money and do a 5 Apple Square Deal ~ you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Pretty Good Vacation My family and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from March 24-28 and overall had a very nice time.Check in- Check in went very smoothly, no one was in line so we didn't have to wait that long and they greet you with a drink. Our room was in an excellent location, we were in building 29 which was very close to the pool and beach but quite a distance from the lobby. A bell boy gathered our luggage and he took us by tram to our room.Food- We were very close to choosing another hotel once we read about all the people getting sick. The food was not as bad as I thought it would be. Granted it's not the food we are use to but we all ate well and no one got sick. When making reseverations at the lobby go early and make reservations for 2 days because spots go quick. Heres a breakdown of the restaurants:La Hispanola- That was the main buffet located in the lobby that serves breakfast lunch and dinner. We ate most of our breakfast's there and they were ok. Pankcakes were good, omlettes surprising were good(they make them right in front of you) and smoothies were great. NOTE: Breakfast and lunch items in the buffet's aren't labeled so be careful but for dinner it is. Chopin: Another dinner buffet. It was my favorite restaurant. The cajun chicken was excellent and im not a big fan of spicy foods. If you go to Chopin look for Felix, he's a server there and kept us really occupied. He is very funny when trying to understand english.Bella Pasta-This is an italian restaurant. It was ok. It certainly was no gourmet italian restuant. But they give you a lot of courses.El Gaucho-This is mainly a steak house. The portions are small but pretty good. El gaucho is also a buffet for breakfast and lunch.Mcprincess-This was just alittle burger and hotdog place. Not really good. We didn't eat at el pescador and sakura or the licey.All the drinks were great. My favorite was the coco loca. Pool- The pool is HUGE and is kept very clean. There are alot of chairs and huts. The chairs for the pool are for the most part in the shade so if you want the sun go to the beach. The Animation team does games and things by the pool also.Beach-The beach is absoutley gorgeous. The water is so pretty and for the most part warm. I live by the beach so I didn't think it was rough but if your not familiar with the ocean you may think it is rough. There are plenty of chairs on the beach but you have to go early to reserve a spot. You usually saved chairs by the beach in the sun and a hut by the pool for shade. Theres kayaking, snorkeling, boats rides, and parasailing at the beach(all not included just kayaking, snorkeling, and catamaran.)We did kayaking and the bananna boat which was alot of fun. I would recomend paying the $10 per person, if you love speed.Rooms-I wasn't to impressed with the rooms. There was 4 of us so it was kind of cramped. It was very dark and drabby. There are NO washcloths so bring your own. It didn't bother me that much the room because we didn't spend to much time there.Weather-According to some people March and April is their rainy season and I believe them. For most of our vacation this was the weather pattern: sunny in the morning, clouding up by early after noon heavy rain showers on and off all day with sun peaking out sometimes. So the weather was the only thing that really ruined the trip. Although it was warm out every day and its very humid. We saw one show there, it was actually pretty good. They have different shows every night and each week it changes. The have the shows posted on a board in the main lobby. One more note before I finish. When arriving in Punta Cana dress cool and comfortable because the airport is out doors. You get off the plane basically on the runway. Hope my review has helped you and answered any questions you had.

<Content>Not disappointed. This is my third trip to D.R. The hotel was the best and it was worth paying a little more. We had a one bedroom suite with small livingroom, few steps up to the bedroom and the bathroom was divided so that one person could be showering or using the head and the sink was still available for putting on makeup, etc. The balcony was square and large and overlooked their beautiful gardens. Free bar fridge and safe in the room was convenient.President beer was not bad at all. Took a while to get to know what I wanted at the buffet. Lots of food and choice....but just not what I was familiar with. However, by day 5, we knew where we could get what and at what time. We found that the buffet close to the beach was just as good for lunch because of what we ate.The steak house (El Goucho??) was terrible, we couldn't get past the smell of the beef. The pasta restaurant was very good.The entertainment was very good considering where we were. They put a lot of energy into performing. Had an after dinner brandy while we watched the show. We didn't like the pre amble to the show, but everything was ok.Having been to the D.R. before, we now realize how poor they are there. The maids don't speak English at all but we left notes with pictures, etc. We brought a lot of U.S. $1 bills and tipped everywhere.Left clothes and shoes for the maid on the last day. The bartenders did go to the person who tipped occassionally. The people were very friendly and helpful . Some spoke English better than others. The ones with the better English were more confident and smiled more. I felt that the somber faces were insecure because they weren't confident about their language skills.The best part was the beach. We are big beach walkers and we never reached the end either way. I spoke to a lot of travellers there and we agreed, this was one of the best beaches we've ever seen for walking or swimming. The water is warm. Some waves for fun. No shells or rocks. We noticed on the net that weather forcast before and during our trip was rain. This did not happen. It did rain once and it was over in 10min.Our suite was 844. Closer to the beach than the front desk. Walk was short and grounds were beautiful.Did not see bugs or mosquitos. Watch the sun. Even tho we went to tanning salons before we left, we still got burned. Also, my feet got blisters from all the walking on the sand.Have a great time, kathy

<Content>Great Time in Punta Cana I am writing this review because I read a lot of reviews before I left for Punta Cana and was quite paranoid about eating the food. We stayed at the Bavaro Princess and had a wonderful time. There were four of us, two teens and my husband and I. No one got sick. The food was very good for an all inclusive and our room was very nice. It was a little worn but clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and energetic. The beach and pool were beautiful. We will be back.

<Content>Paradise My wife and I just visited this resort with three other couples from March 21 to 28. I normally do not take the time to post these types of reviews but I read several before we left and was a little nervous because of them. All of the negative reviews are ridiculous. This place gives you every opportunity to have an amazing vacation. The beach and pool are truly top notch. It just does not get any better. The food is better than expected given that you are dining in the Dominican Republic, not Canada. I was pleasantly surprised as the omelettes, pasta, pizzas, chicken were excellent. I am a big fan of high end food but you won't get that anywhere in a country like the Dominican Republic. The buffets are good. The Sakura and Bella Pasta restaurants are as good as you would expect anywhere, particularly Bella Pasta. Servers do not speak much English but that is part of the charm of a foreign country...don't forget you are in their country.We were very consistent tippers everywhere and it did not seem to make much difference...surprisingly. I probably spent $100 on tips during the week and can't say I got better service in any way...oh well. The people are very laid back but very friendly. As far as excursions, swimming with the dolphins at Dolphin Island was fun. The Caribean Festival with snorkeling with sharks etc is excellent, I highly recommend it. Parasailing at the beach is a must...you are not far from the beach and it is well worth the money.The rooms...awesome. Large, clean, big balcony. You don't need anything more.Most importantly, this place will not make you sick. You can get sick in a foreign country from anything...this resort does not cause you to get sick...it is clean and safe. Don't drink tap water and don't try foods that you are not sure of to play it safe. Do not listen to the people who complain about their flights and post it on a review of a resort...or blame some sickness on the resort. It is silly. This resort is great and if you want to have a great time there, you have every opportunity.We would go back, and we would also take our children there next time.

<Content>A few snafus... I have to say that we read all the reviews before we went on our vacation, and were kind of nervous... but if you're there for the beach and relaxation, then its hard not to enjoy your self. I don't want to repeat what everyone else has already said, so I'll try to point out a few big things.  - We emailed ahead of time to request a certain room, and although they never replied, they must have taken it into consideration. Our room had a fantastic location right by the beach and the pool. - The resort is big, but its definetly walkable. We rarely took the little trolley because it only takes 7-10 min to walk from one end of the resort to the other.  - I would recommend going Platinum. We didn't, but the other couple we were with did. They got much better service from the bartenders and better alcohol, a better room (quality wise), free massages, free room service, free other stuff, and ability to book dinner reservations - I think overall it would be worth it. My big problems were with the food and our room.  - Making reservations every morning was a huge pain in the [-]. The food is not too good and alot of times we had to wait forever to get any service. We actually liked the buffets the best beucase you can see what you're getting and you can get it when you ant.  - Even thought the location of the room was awesome and the room was clean and nice - there were some issues. My first and big one was that there is no real door on the bathroom! there was a set of saloon type doors to separate the bathroom with the shower and toilet and the bedroom area - so not really much privacy (although our friends in platinum did have a real door). The other big problem was that we had little ants on our countertop and cockroaches! yeek... So overall it was a really good deal for the amount we paid and a beautiful beach. If we come back though, I will definelty want to stay somewhere else. Not becuase we hated the resort, but because i know there is better and i would pay a little more for it.

<Content>Great all around!! My husband and I stayed here March 11-18, The resort was spotless, always someone cleaning. Never a leaf or blade of grass out of place. The beach was amazing, The pool large and clean.If you want a hut at the beach or pool you do need to get there early for a good spot but most times we arrived after breakfast by 9:30 and found one. Not the best ones but still open and when you want shade does it matter how close to the water you are? I never came across any rude people. I agree with other reviews that it is just the language barrier, not rude. Most people spoke enough english to get by, But your in there home so take some time to learn a few pharses and you'll do fine. Tipping wasn't nessasary but it did make them remember you and a tad more friendly, if that was posiable. Everyone was exstreamly pleasent!! I went around on our last 2 days finding and tipping the people I was in contact with most and enjoyed, Maxamo and Carmen at the pool bar work their butts off to keep you quenched! We tipped more to our maid if we needed some thing extra, other wise 3-4 $ a day.As for people saying that employees were looking at your hands to see if you had a tip or not B4 waiting on you I find this wrong, I beleave they are looking at your wrist band, Everyone has a differant color meaning differant levels. Thats all. Every one was equal unless you yourself chose to be above everyone else, then your the fool. We ate at the buffets every day. The resturant menus weren't that impressive to wait in line for. We didn't starve by any means but don't go to an island for the food, you go for the weather and water, RIGHT?! We did go to bella pasta one nite but they make you wait in the hall way until just the precice moment, they let you in for a medocore meal. To me, the interesting variety of the buffet was fun! Our room was basic and clean, nice balcony and view,Room 63 right close to the lobby and a 10 min walk to the beach and main pool.There was a smaller quieter pool right there also, nice to just relax at, no jumping/screaming kids. The trollys run often and we never had a problem getting on. The walk was nice though, only by the 3rd day after a full day in the sun you want a ride back to your room! The mangrove was nice I love animals so it was a touch of nature by the beach. We enjoyed feeding the turtles and fish. My only complaint about this resort is the time share sales men. They attack you fresh out of the lobby buffet, they sit right at the first table and have white shirts on. They hound you like car sales men!! I HATE THAT!! If i'm interested I'll come to you, don't you come to me. They get you to the Licey building, offer you what ever it takes ( free massage, etc) then there time share speach. We stayed clear of them all week! The Mac Princess cook is a great guy, I wish he was still open when we left I wanted to tip him! He is really funny, He enjoys people and his job, The hamburgs are another story but they will get you through the week. Go just to see him. The burgers aren't like ours more like a thin Jimmy Dean breakfast patty. But ediable.Go with an open mind and remember why you went, Sun, fun, sand, and enjoy!! You can contact me with any questions I'd be happy to help! Have a great time and don't worry about the negitive reviews here. Be smart, don't drink the water, don't eat mystry meat, and watch out for the pina colatas and coco locos, Coconut and pineapple are natural laxitives. So if you party hard and sit in the sun dehydrated, thats why you got sick. Not from the food. Bring some pepto and anti-diarrhea med if your worried!

<Content>Loved it!! After reading recent poor reviews about Bravaro Princess, I was very nervous about our choice of hotel. Nothing to worry about! Here is the scoop--Traveled March 18-March 25. Did the platinum package.THE GOOD: The grounds are stunning. The beach is fabulous. The sand is powder fine (no rocks). The platinum package was worth the extra $$. Staff was very nice. Room was acceptable. Sakura restraunt had very good food. El Gaucho restraunt had very good food also. Bella Pasta was good too. The maid did an excellent job with our room. Our fridge was always stocked. Free internet access in the platinum lounge. THE BAD: Waiting for the trolly. Complete waste of vacation time. The trolleys were often full so we had to wait an additonal 10 minutes for the next one. They smelled terrible. The gas fumes were horrendous. By the time we got off the trolly every evening for dinner we were nausious from the fumes. The food was not that great @ the buffets. Things tasted the same, but there is a pasta bar and you can always eat pasta! THE UGLY: You have to be on the Apple Vacation bus @ 9:15 am the day of check out for a 1:30 pm flight. That is a rip off. There is NO reason to leave for the airport 4 hours prior. The lines at the airport are ridiculous and most of the workers were very rude. We stood in line for 2 whole hours just to chek in. 2 hours on the beach would have been much better. This is not a refelction on the resort, but be aware the airport departure is a nightmare!Overall, we had a great time. No food posioning. No illness whatsoever. I would go back to Punta Cana in a minute. I would stay @ the Bavaro Princess also. Have a great vacation!

<Content>Great, relaxing vacation Just returned from a week stay, March 17-24, 2006. Had expected the worst, but was pleasantly surprised. Everything was 5 apple, as promised. Clean, big room, great balcony. Only saw two bugs and a few mesquitos during the stay. Didn't mind the walking, as it is beautiful and needed to walk off all the food, anyway. Didn't get sick, but paid attention to what I ate. Think I got the runs only because I drank too much of the Presidente beer (yum!) Highlight was the free scuba lesson in pool, which ended with an hour scuba diving in ocean ($79). Tipping didn't seem to make a big difference, but there wasn't anything else to spend money on, so why not? Enjoyed the shopping across the street, but walk on down the street a bit for better bargains. It was so relaxing, that you didn't want to leave the resort. Hour massage was great ($70). Got the list of upgrades to Platinum, but probably wouldn't do it unless I had lots of money (like honeymooners, etc.). We were in Building 12 which was 3-5 minutes from beach, and 10 from Reception--perfect! Do wear worn in shoes!Only hassle was departing from the Punta Cana airport. It was a mad house for our 2:45 pm flight. We had allowed 2 hours, but had to rush to front of line to get waited on--airline people were worthless. Many upset people trying to get to their flights. American Airlines had a much longer line than anybody else.Plan to return with other family members. Great gathering spot. Might be too big for little kids, but besides that, it is paradise!

<Content>Beautiful Resort, Friendly Staff My husband, 15 year old son  myself stayed at the Bavaro Princess during March Break (Mar 13-20). We flew out of Halifax with Skyservice, good flight and very friendly flight crew. Arrival in Punta Cana was quick and painless. When you first arrive they give you a blue immigration paper to fill out. My advise, get 2 each because you have to fill one out before leaving the country also and if you get an extra one and have it filled out before arriving at the airport it will save some time. The resort is very large as stated before, but that didn't bother us much. We were in villa 48, close to the lobby which was convenient for breakfast, nightly shows and making dinner reservations. It was about a 10 minute walk to the beach and 1 minute to the Lobby to catch a trolly to the beach. We didn't have to wait long for trollies or to be served at any of the many bars or the buffets. The beach bar and beach buffet were very busy but that's to be expected. I didn't find the service any different if we tipped or not, we were always looked after efficently and promptly and of course always with a smile. We believe that you are treated the way you treat others and we always said hola and gracias. The staff are very friendly and they do the best they can considering they have hundreds of guests to accommodate. Some do speak English but most don't, but we didn't take that as being rude. The beach is absolutely beautiful, fine white powdery sand and the water temperature was wonderful. We did find the beach to be very busy and people do reserve the palapas very early in the morning as well as at the pool. The beach does have a lot of palm trees so there is shade to be found.We ate at all the restaurants except Licey (didn't want to pay $35US each for dinner) and found them all quite good with the exception of El Pescador (seafood). We all had the stuffed baked lobster, not good at all. Our favourite was Bella Pasta (Italian), very good. Sakura was good except they mixed up our orders but it was tastey just the same. The buffets were the usual buffet food. The chicken, fries and pizza were always really good at lunchtime. The made to order omelletes and fresh pancakes were really good for breakfast. As usual, the fresh fruit was always great - especially the pineapple. I was very concerned about going to this resort after reading all of the negative reviews about food poisoning a few weeks before departure. I do think the management should take a good long look at the food preparations and the water they use if that is what is causing all the sickness. My son got sick with diarrhea 3 days before coming home but he tried to make the best of it and didn't let it spoil his trip. We're not sure how he contracted that, he was very careful with the food and drinks and only used bottled water for drinking and brushing his teeth. If you go here with kids be very careful. I'm not sure if we would go back to this resort or to Punta Cana in the future (not because of the area, it's beautiful) but there are so many different places and resorts we'd like to try. All in all we had a great week. The weather was fantastic, couldn't have asked for any better and the sun is very hot so bring lots of sunscreen.

<Content>Great Beach Mediocre Food My wife and I have just returned from the Bavaro Princess - a few hours ago in fact - so I am writing this while the vacation is still very fresh in my mind. My overall impression is positive - good airport transfers, check in, staff relations, excellent rooms, beautiful grounds and one of the best beaches in the Caribbean. However the food was very definitely a minus. Before our trip, I read many Tripadvisor reviews and noted several negative comments about the food. There were also reviews from guests who found the food to be excellent. I can't agree with the latter group. With rare exception, any food intended to be delivered and eaten hot arrived at the table lukewarm or worse. Several people noted you were only guaranteed hot food if it was specially ordered - omelettes, pastas and so on.This is accurate. I would give the food a 4/10 and the other features an 9/10. They need to allocate more of their operating budget to the food service and perhaps have fewer gardeners cutting the same hedges each day . Pleasant stay but I wouldn't repeat it - the food is too integral a part of a vacation and this aspect needs the serious attention of the management of a hotel billed as 5 star.

<Content>Frequent Visitor My family owns a time share with the Royal Princess company. We go to this hotel every spring and have for the past 5 years. I have had a range of experiences both good and bad here but have found the the people of the Dominician Republic are gracious and lovely. We travel with a five year old and they have always been so wonderful to all children. I will say that I was disappointed with their mini-club staff. The one woman who ran the day camp facilities and nighly mini-discothis year was not up to the usual standards. Frankly I don't think that she likes kids all that much. I was not the only parent to observe this and decided not to leave my son in her care.Overall the hotel food is standard but not fantastic, the beach is lovely, the pool is welcoming. The maid service in the rooms only rates about a 2 1/2 to 3 star rating. They tend to reuse the towels instead of giving fresh ones and only give the rooms a quick cleaning. The staff at the bars and rersturants are great and sweet to everytime they see you. The managment is slow to answer the needs and requests to the guests and have been each time I have been to the hotel.

<Content>Disappointed with a few things Just returned on 12Mar06 from this resort and had many disappointments. The food was tasteless and several people that I met has suffered from food poisioning. The beach was beautiful and weather was great. I found the pool to be cool and did not like the entrance way in. The only positive on the trip, were the lovely people we met from Canada.I have been to many resorts ,and this was one was lacking in alot of activities, such as entertainment, dancing, and being able to socialize at a sit down beach bar. I will choose another location next time.

<Content>Wonderful vacation - a few complaints though... I just returned from a 7 day vacation to Punta Cana - and I hate to say it, but it really started off on the wrong foot. Me and my party arrived @ BWI at 4am to catch the 6am flight to Punta Cana - little did we know that our flight had been cancelled. We weren't alone as there were about 100 other passengers there with us. We got a very vague explanation of why our flight wouldn't be taking off on time, and that maybe our flight would leave @ 5:30pm. To make a VERY LONG story short, we were never contacted by our Apple Vacation Rep @ the airport, the airline themselves had no information and about 40 of us were stranded @ the airport to find our flight info by ourselves. Needless to say when we finally left BWI at 7:10pm (13 hours after arriving there) USA3000 flight #315 was filled with a bunch of tired, frustrated passengers just wanting to start their vacation. (And just a sidenote, if you are stranded @ the airport for 13 hours, Apple offers you no vouchers and no assistance on their Customer Service line for complaints. I will NEVER take another Apple Vacation again!!)But onto the actual vacation - the flight to Punta Canna was smooth with no problems, but be on your toes when arriving at their airport! You are rushed into one giant line were you will need to pay your $10 entrance fee to the country and also get your passport stamped. Beware, they hurry you so much that they didn't stamp my sister's passport- when she tried to get back in the line to tell them they hurried her off again telling her not to worry. Well she was adamant about this and then they realized their mistake. No apologies offered, just stamped the passport and hurried us to luggage. (Another sidenote, the $10 fee is also expected when you leave the island. If you are traveling w/ Apple they take care of the $10 EXIT fee but you must pay when you enter the country.)Once we got our luggage our Apple rep was there to tell us what bus to take to the Bavaro - once we were on the bus it was about 12:30 am - Most of us at this point had been up for 24 hours!!It was a smoot ride to the hotel (about 20 minutes @ that time of night b/c there is no traffic!) Once we arrived at the hotel, we checked in and were whisked away to our rooms and the luggage followed about 20 minutes later. Thus the end of our first day of vacation....Bedtime 2 am.We we woke up the next morning, we tried to forget about the previous day of travel and were still a bit cranky.. The Bavaro did take our request to have our three rooms put together, so we had gotten two bottom rooms and one top room. The bottom rooms my family was into smelled a bit musty so remember to take along a couple candles to ease the stink. Our room on the top floor didn't have a musty smell but we were the only ones that had little ants on our countertops throughout the week. They weren't really a bother, but I'm not totally comfortable with things crawling around my toiletries either! Give and take to having a top floor room.The buffets were good, nothing to rave about though. We did breakfast @ La Hispaniola every morning and were satisfied with their meals(you do not need reservations there.) We also did this buffet ever other night b/c it was hard to get reservations every night for dinner. We learned that the desk for dinner reservations for the other restaurants opened @ 8am - and tho get a good spot you needed to be in line by 7:45am - those reservations went quick!!Diner @ the buffet La Hispaniola was very nice - the staff there was excellent! We went to the other buffett @ Chopin Restaurant the second night - that was the equivalent to La Hispaniola, nothing great! I missed out on the night the family went to the Japanese restaurant Sakura. Unfortunately I must have swallowed some of the water and was feeling pretty rough! Most of my family was happy with there meals, but the said the staff was terribly ignorant. We also tried dinner @ Pescador. That was also adaquate, but nothing special - again the staff wasn't pleasant. We enjoyed our lunch everday @ El Gaucho - they are located right on the beach and had different types of food @ their buffet. GREAT FOOD! The days consisted of reserving a hut first thing in the morning, they are all claimed by 8am. Putting your towels under a hut will reserve it for a couple hours. The beach is absolutely gorgeous and the ocean is delightful - it made every other complaint disappear and remind us of why we booked this trip. NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE BEACH!!!There was just a bit of a language barrier there, but nothing too frustrating. Most of the staff in the main lobby know English, but it was mostly just the restaurants were there was the most confusion. The waiters and waitresses knew very little English. By the end of the week, everyone you passed was yelling Hola! and going about their business. In the end, with all of the low points of the trip, it was definitely worth taking and we all did enjoy ourselves. Punta Cana is absolutely gorgeous and it was worth every penny.

<Content>Best Beach Ever Stayed at the Bavaro Princess Suites March 4 to 11, 2006 through Apple Vacations. Found the Hotel to be beautiful, grounds especially, clean, service good, food about what we are used to in the Dominican Republic. No complaints. We go for the beach and of all I have been on it has the following advantages:soft sand, doesn't get hot under your feet, miles of beach to walk on, no shells, no rocks, gentle sloap into the water, water colors are simply amazing and the temperature of the water in early March was cool to walk into but once in comfortable. Constant breeze makes the air temperature comfortable.Beautiful palm trees right on the beach, plenty of lounge chairs, food and drink steps away. Went with local beer (fine) she with wine (fine). Remember to take a larger container,(bring a large cup or cooler type cup from home. They will fill it up. Keeps you from waiting in line.Slight tummy upset on last 2 days. Nothing to ruin the trip. Don't know if it was the water (we drank the processed water in the room) or food (sometimes undercooked)All an all an excellent, relaxing trip at a resort to which we would return.Ray/usaPool lovely.

<Content>First time on a resort type trip First time traveller to an all inclusive with young teenaged daughter (first mommy/daughter trip). Room was spacious and clean if somewhat dated and lacked a clock radio. Service and grounds were excellent and nightly entertainment was always fresh and vibrant. My only complaint about the whole trip is related to the actions of other tourists on our first day. We headed for the beach after a late breakfast (around 11:00 a.m.) We'd been walking around for 15 min. looking for two chairs under a shaded cabana but found none. There were plenty of shaded chairs with towels on them however. Two couples we were standing next to advised me that the cabana next to theirs had been sitting unoccupied since 8 a.m. and we could take the towels off as they had been abandoned. About an hour later two ladies and their 3-4 teenaged kids arrived looking for the chairs one of them claimed to have placed towels on at on at 7:30 a.m. From their conversation I gathered they were arriving directly from their room and had not been on the beach earlier. The lady asked me if I had taken towels off their chairs. Not wanting to get into an argument over chairs I said no, they were our chairs. (Our tour Rep. had told us in our briefing that chairs left unattended for more than 1/2 hour are considered abandoned, towels or no towels. This rule is posted on each cabana in plain English). This lady insisted we were on her chairs and proceeded to run around in circles yelling in Italian, calling me and my young daughter the most disgusting names. I was horrified for my daughter having to hear this directed at her. I tried at first to ignore the woman but her group sat right behind us and they continued with the insults in Italian. I then approached the group and informed them that I was Italian myself (to their surprise) and understood every word they were saying. I was disgusted with her actions, horrifed at my daughter being subjected to such name calling, especially from a grown adult and found their behaviour shameful, regardless of who the chairs belonged to. There was no excuse for this behaviour, especially since she herself had young daughters sitting there giggling over the whole thing. Wanting more to protect my daughter from what could have been an ugly scene, I told her to take the seats and left. The people who'd told me to take the seats were good enough to invite us to stay under their shaded area and I am still so grateful for their kindness on our first day. They were from around the Michigan area and very decent human beings. All visitors should follow the rules about the beach seats - you cannot get up at the crack of dawn to claim seats with towels and then leave for hours on end. It is inconsiderate to others who have also paid for the same privileges. The rest of the trip was fabulous and we met nice people from the U.S. and Canada. Highly recommend the Countryside Safari trip, it was unforgetable and well worth it. If you go please bring schools supplies to the elementary school you visit, as the kids (about 20) need all kinds of supplies. Food wasn't bad, considering the volume of people to be fed. Avoided creams, salad bar and eggs due to reviews on this board about food contamination problems. I suspect that it might be related to the hamburgers served by the beach however - we tried them once but threw them out after a few bits because the inside was still pink (not even sure it's real meat) and I noticed that the cook handled the patties with his bare hands, even flipping them on the grill with his hands instead of a spatula. The sun is very deceivingly strong - got burned but my fault, not the resort's. Only real complaint I have about the resort is the difficulty in booking dinners at the a la carte restaurants. They were only booking one day ahead and we were only able to try two restaurants Chopin and Sakura)- no piano player when we went and Sakura at 10:00 p.m. dinner slot not worth the wait.

<Content>Loved the Bavaro Princess We stayed at the Bavaro Princess from March 4th to the 11th, I can't say enough good about the place. Our room was very nice, very clean and maid service was great. The grounds were beautiful and very well maintained. The pool area was beautiful and the beach was also beautiful. Everyone was so friendly and always a smile for you. Train drivers (especially Francisco) were great too, always available if you wanted to ride instead of walking to where you wanted to go. I would highly recommend this resort, even if your traveling with children, there are lots of activities for the young, middle aged and older. We would definitely go back to Punta Cana and stay at the Bavaro Princess...

<Content>Food Poisoning Like other reviews, the beach and grounds were wonderful. Found the staff very pleasant and friendly.The food was mediocore, but what do you expect with an all-inclusive on an island?Like others 4 out of the 6 in our party became sick. Fortunately for us, we had already arrived back home.My husband was tested positive for salmonella.Will not go back to the Bavaro. Maybe we would rethink DR.

<Content>Treated like royalty! My husband and I just returned from our trip. We were given a 5 Apple Square Deal so we didn't know where we were staying until we got to Philly airport. What a pleasant surprise! We stayed from 3/8 to 3/15. It started to get a little more busy on the 13th. Check in and check out was a breeze. You are greeted with a complimentary drink. We got to the room and the bags were there within 5 minutes. The rooms look exactly like the brochure. Spacious and nice. Not Waldorf Astoria nice but very nice.On the first morning, my husband decided to walk on the beach for about 3 hours. No problem, I made coffee, went out to the patio to enjoy the view. Uh oh, the door shut and I had locked myself out. I found a maid next door who didn't speak English. I don't know but a few words of Spanish, but it didn't matter. I said 'Estupida' made a key motion and shrugged. She smiled and unlocked my door for me. I thanked her and tipped her $5. I was in my bathrobe after all. She left us extra beer every day and made sure that we had plenty of water. The room was always spotless. The bartenders always saw us coming, greeted us with an 'Hola mi amigos!' and got our drinks right away. Ruben, Melvin and Francisco at the beach bar, Ramon at the lobby bar, Anna at the restaurant bar and Carmen at the pool bar became quick friends with us. Restaurant staff also recognized us and treated us like royalty. We didn't have reservations at the steak house, but Peralta said it was okay and took us right in. We had a group of 6 and it really wasn't a problem for them to make us their last table of the night. Italian restaurant as well. Our reservation was for 10 pm. We got there around 9 and had planned on having drinks until 10. Apostol said not a problem to take us in early if we wanted. Chopin was a beautiful restaurant. This time we were about 45 minutes late for our reservation. We feared they would turn us away as there was only a 15 minute wait and the reservation would be cancelled.Again, no problem. Our friends paid for the Cafe Del Mar and said it was unbelivable. The lobster tail that one ordered came as 3 huge tails stuffed with scallops. They also had beds on platforms on the beach where you sipped champagne or wine. We had no problem with the food. There was always such a variety to choose from. My husband is a pretty picky eater, meat and potatoes guy, and was very happy with the buffets. The El Gaucho buffet during the day never repeated a salad the entire 7 days we were there. There were always 4 different ones to choose from, aside from the fresh salad bar. I felt a little ill the last night we were there but that could have been from the 12 vodka and lemonades and 2 shots of mammajuana I'd consumed during the hot humid day! Oh yeah, they don't skimp on the alcohol either. Grounds were gorgeous. Very well maintained and always at least 25 workers daily trimming and pruning. Beach was unbelievable. White sand and aquamarine water. Always very clean. They had many people cleaning up the cups and trash that people left on the beach and around the pool. This was our first vacation without a child in 16 years and first in the Carribean. I would highly recommend Punta Cana to be enjoyed by all. Especially this hotel. It seemed to be the best around. We heard at least 5 couples complain about the Iberostar which surprised me as it was listed as 6 golden apples to our 5 apple!

<Content>One of the most beautiful resorts i have been to the bavarro princess is beautiful!!! the staff is pleasant and friendly. the beach is unbelievable! the whole resort is immaculate.the only complaint that i have is in the food. the buffets are very good (breakfast, lunch and dinner) the other restaurants leave something to be desired. the sunkara is by far the worst restaurant on the premises. the fish restaurant was a disappointment (i had the lobster which was over cooked and mushy). the italian restaurant was by far the best of the restaurants. the food and service was good. the licey is in a beautiful setting, the service was exceptional, but the food could have been much better. it was not worth the extra charge.

<Content>paradise We Just got back from bavaro princess we went from (march 1 to 8)I would have to say it was the best trip I've ever been on.I've never seen so many people work so hard and be happy at the same time. The staff was great very friendly and no matter what would serve you with a smile.We did tip on some occasins and they were greatly appreciated.Francisco was one of the trolly drivers he gets you across the resort he was always happy to do his job,he worked everyday.As for the food we had a lot to choose from and we never got sick our favorite was the la hispanola it was a buffet at the front lobby the dinner went in themes so some nights it would be mexican or dominican and so many more it was awesome.The resort was so clean I could not beleive how clean sometimes .The girls constantly cleaned everything, they would even sweep the paths.We would leave gifts on our pillow for the maid and we always have a full fridge.The landscape there was beautiful and they had peacocks running around to they were beautiful.The BEACH was awesome there are no words to describe how soft the sand was awwww and the water was so blue. The beach wasn't that crowded I never had a problem to get a spot the pool was a bit more crowded but we a more beach people anyways.We went on a few excursions my favorite was jurrasic safari our tour guide was monchy he was really funny,a tour guide does make a difference trust me.We seen kids in school and a cock fight went to see how cigars are made and coffee to. overall the trip was great there are not enough words to describe how much we loved it.We are returning in august thats how much we liked it there. If anybody wants to go its definetly the perfect place to go staff is great there just treat them nice there not your personal butler.

<Content>Staff great, food questionable. Traveling group: 53yo male, 51yo female and me, 34yo female.Previous resort-style experience: Bermuda, cruise, Iberostar Resort in Punta Cana.I would give five stars if not for the food. We almost cancelled our reservations because of reports of food poisoning we'd read on this Web site. We didn't because we figured that if there had been food poisoning, the resort would be extra super careful. It looked like they were being careful, but we still ran into many people who got food poisoning, including 7 out of 8 people in a group from Canada, four out of five people in a family from the U.S. plus a few other people. No one in our group of three got sick, but we were very, very careful. We ate toast for breakfast, french fries for lunch and pasta for dinner. Hardly any meat and nothing with mayonaise. We always found something to eat, but it kind of sucked to be worried about getting sick.While there, we talked to an American woman who said she had been hired the week before as a food consultant because the resort was losing so much business over reports of bad food. She said Americans and Canadians were getting sick but not other nationalities so the resort was trying to figure out what we North Americans were eating that the others weren't. Consultant said everything at the pasta bar, including the meat sauce, is safe and also anything that's cooked to order. The bread and cake-like deserts are safe too, she said. There was a suspicion that employees were cutting up fruit with knives that had been washed in tap water. To fix it, they are installing a new water filtration system. Also, while we were there they took down all of the decorative carved fruits and vegetables, which had appeared to be rotting. That may have solved the problem. Anyway, they are working on it and if the problem is resolved then I would definitely return to this resort but I would not go there now. I went to the D.R. for the sun, not the food. If you're a foodie, go on a cruise instead.Here's a rundown of where we ate:Hispanola: The main buffet. Better than El Gaucho for breakfast because it has fresh juices, fresh waffles and fried dough, which El Goucho doesn't. Skip the eggs; they taste like kerosene. Try the drinking chocolate. Yum. MacPrincess: Passable. Burgers are like breakfast sausages. They don't taste great, but we ate them and didn't get sick. The cook, Leonardo, has a great sense of humor. He'll make you a cheeseburger, no cheese or a hamburger with cheese. If you ask for one he'll say, OK. Tomorrow. It's worth going there just to talk to Leonardo.Chopin: Also a buffet. Smaller selection and not much better than Hispanola though you have to make reservations. There is a pasta bar. We did try the meat here (cooked to order) and found it very tough. At 8:30, a piano player and singer sail around the restaurant's lake on a boat. Can't decide if it was elegant or hokey. See for yourself. If you go, be sure to sit in Marilyn's section. She is friendly and awesome, as is most of the staff. El Pescador: We had the lobster, which was sooo dry and had a consistency simlar to toothpaste. Found out later this is because they half-cook the lobsters earlier in the day and then grill them later to finish cooking them. It saves time, supposedly. Can't imagine how much time it saves. Don't get the lobster. Also had the shrimp cocktail here and it was excellent.OK, enough about food:The beach: A+. Warm, nice, goregous.The pool: A+. Two pools, one large and with a swim-up bar. Very conveniently located near the beach. Can easily go back and forth between the two. Other reviewers said the pool was crowded, but I didn't find that. Could be because people were sick in their rooms?!? Could always swim without getting splashed or feeling crowded.The drinks: B-. Bartenders are very friendly but drinks were weak. See Maximo at the swim-up bar for stronger drinks and great service. Try the banana mamas.The grounds: A+. Maintenance guys were always working. If you ask, they will open a coconut for you. Yum. (Don't forget to tip them. These guys work for something like $200 a month and don't often get tips like other resort workers.) The casino: A-. I'd give them an A+ but I lost a couple hundred bucks! Most dealers are friendly. The ones that appear not friendly just don't speak English. Went to Iberostart Punta Cana's casino last year and the dealers sucked. They got mad if you won. At the Princess, they celebrated with you if you won. The disco: C. Music was fine but the place was dead. It's open all night and I didn't stay past 1, so maybe it picks up. A lot of locals and resort employees go here. The trams: A. Never had to wait more than a few minutes. If it isn't busy, you'll get door-to-door service, otherwise you'll get dropped off at trolly stops and have to walk a short way.The mangrove nature area: B. A neat little walk to see unusual birds, fish and turtles. Worthwhile if you want a break from the beach.The staff: A. Very friendly, especially if you try to speak Spanish. You might have trouble getting your point across in some instances if you don't speak Spanish. I speak a bit so I never had a problem and I helped translate for other guests. The rooms: B-. The layout was cool, a separate little dressing area and all. The rooms need minor upgrades. Mirrors are chipped and walls could use to be repainted. Big complaint is that there are two doorstops behind the french doors in the bathroom. I stepped on them or stubbed my toes on them every morning. They are in really stupid places. One doorstop was broken and I cut my foot on it. Thinking about getting a tetanus shot now. Poolside activities: B. Water aerobics and pool games every afternoon. A good way to meet others. Side trips: We didn't do any this trip cuz we were having so much fun relaxing on the beach and at the pool. Last year (through a different resort) we did the Outback Safari, which was worthwhile. A good chance to see how the real people live. You visit a home, a school, a market, a sugar cane plantation and a secluded beach. Worth doing once, not twice. Bring lots of sunblock.Advice:1.) Don't go until they fix the food problems. Otherwise bring a jar of peanut butter and other snacks.2.) Bring gifts for the workers' children. We left lots of things for the maid's two kids: coloring books, barrettes, stickers, little toys, etc. She was very appreciative and made us gorgeous flower arrangements to thank us. The flowers weren't necessary but they showed how much a little gesture means to these people who are paid so little. 3.) Learn basic Spanish phrases and bring a Spanish dictionary. Be patient when communicating with staff that doesn't speak English and remeber you're in THEIR country. Don't be annoyed if they don't speak your language.4.) Bring a $10 bill to the airport to pay a travel fee. They don't give change.5.) Bring home lots of coffee or you will regret it when you run out.

<Content>Beautiful Resort, Great Staff, Gorgeous Beach At long last . . . here is my review of the Bavaro Princess. We stayed at the BP Feb. 12 鈥?26 in 2005, and also Feb. 12 鈥?26, 2006. Last year we were VIP and this year we went Platinum with Air Canada. I will base this review mostly on this year鈥檚 experience, with a few comparisons to last year.Flight out of Toronto was very good. Checking in was quick and easy and the flight was uneventful. There is nothing like the feeling of warm tropical air when they first open the plane door on arrival! Getting though customs was quick and painless. They took both halves of our new tourist visa. . . which caused me a bit of concern. I had been told to keep one half for departure. This ended up not being a problem. In no time we had picked up our luggage and were on the bus (small one) with only one stop before arriving at the Bavaro Princess. Once we arrived we were given receipts for our luggage, which was left at the front lobby, and whisked off to the Platinum lounge in the trolley. It only took about five minutes to check in, and we were given our room key and safe lock and were told our luggage would be sent to our room shortly. We were give a welcome drink, and our Platinum bracelets, which are really cool in comparison to the hospital- type that are normally used! It was great that our rooms were all ready even though it was only about 1:30 p.m.! Just a short jaunt from the lounge was our room, Bungalow 73, and only about 50 steps away was the gorgeous beach!!!! Our luggage arrived at our room within minutes, and after stowing a few things, we were on the beach by 2:00! Beach towels were in our room, as were bathrobes and slippers, a stocked mini bar, and an in-room liquor dispenser with a bottle of rum, vodka and whiskey. Over at the Platinum lounge you can help yourself to the frig that contains more pop, bottles of water, bottles of champagne, and many many can of Clamato juice! I had many caesars in my room while getting ready for dinner over that 2 week period! Nice little extra! There were also 5 pillows in our room, so I didn鈥檛 even have to ask for extra ones. The rooms are spacious, just like on their website. They also have a lovely large terrace. . . much nicer than just the usual small balconies at some hotels. The Platinum rooms have been painted in a soft yellow, and have new, prettier bedspreads. They also contain a clock radio cd player. The TV鈥檚 are larger and there is a DVD player. DVD鈥檚 can be borrowed from the Platinum lounge. . . something we never did! There is a large closet containing the included safe and an umbrella and iron and ironing board. Bathroom includes a bidet. We were never lacking of hot water, and found the water pressure to be adequate. . . not hard and invigorating. . . but totally adequate. Maid service was great. We had turn down service every evening with fresh towels and anything else that needed restocking. Our beach towels were also replaced daily. There is a coffee maker in the room and they will leave extra packets of coffee if you request it. We liked to bring an extra thermal mug with us to breakfast to bring milk back to the room for our coffee. This we kept in the mini frig. The beer in the rooms is Soberano, but if you tip at the pool bar they will give you bottles of Presidente to bring to your room. We had quite a stash at one point!The beach. . . what can I say! We all know the beach is amazing. . .absolutely spectacular. Of course this is one of the main reasons we go to Punta Cana! This particular stretch of beach is both deep and wide, and the sand is white and soft. The water is wavy, but not too strong that you can鈥檛 stand up. Staff does a great job of getting rid of any seaweed that washes up in the morning...There are several options for breakfast. You can order room service, which is included for Platinum, or go to the beach restaurant, el Gaucho, or the main buffet, Hispanol, or just have a continental breakfast at the Platinum lounge. We tried the beach buffet a few times but the service was a little slow. The omelets were great though! Most days we went to the main buffet. Our waitress there, Ivelissa, remembered us from last year and brought us fresh squeezed orange juice in wine glasses every morning! What a sweetheart! There are so many choices for breakfast. Made to order omelets and eggs, pancakes, waffles, cereals, sweet rolls and breads, fresh fruits, cheeses, meats, and smoothie bar. . . just toooo much to even list! We always had great service here. We enjoyed our morning walk to breakfast through the mangrove swamp. Nice to see all the birds and creatures! Peacocks roam freely and love for you to feed them some bread. Beware of the gaggle of white geese though! They can get a little aggressive! After breakfast we would put on our sunscreen and head to the beach. There are lots of lounges and palapas, but people do tend to reserve the palapas early. If you want one you have to play the towel game. We never found the need for one, so no big deal! Aaaahhhh. . . did I mention the beach!!!!Lunch for us usually included a trip to el Gaucho where you could help yourself to a large assortment of salads, fruits, fish, chicken, steaks, pizza, rice, potatoes, French fries, desserts, ice cream. . . and many other things. There is also the McPrincess where you can get hamburgers, hot dogs and fries. We had the hamburgers once and they were good. I have heard that the hot dogs are deep fried, but I also saw them grilling some. There is also a made to order pasta station, which my husband tried many times. Pasta was delicious! We never went to the main buffet for lunch, but I have heard it is very good.There is a beach bar, but we found it to be very busy and you were not necessarily served in the order in which you arrived. Carmen was a very good bartender, and very quick, but it was so busy that it was just impossible for her to keep up. It also seemed to me that women got slower service, even with tip in hand! It didn鈥檛 matter what your bracelet looked like. . . whether platinum or regular. Of course there were the usual people who will butt in front of anyone. I found that it just worked out better to run into the buffet for self served Presidente, or to zip over to the pool bar for faster service. Maximo was fast and good about serving in the order of arriving. He also makes the BEST caipirinahs (not sure of the spelling)!!!! Speaking of the pool, it rambles all over the place, and is just beautiful, but we are beach people and spent our days there. It is also cooler to sit at the beach than at the pool. I did jump in a few times though for a quick swim!With the platinum you have a free massage each week that you are there. We had the first one at the spa, and it was lovely! The second week we had our massage outside in the hut by the pool. This massage was even better than the first one. Platinum guests are allowed to make their dinner reservations at the Platinum lounge or by phone, for the whole week. You can also book reservations for the other Princess resorts if you wish. . . something we didn鈥檛 do. We enjoyed the first week so much that we thought we would just hang out here again the second week. I think the sun makes you lazy!!!! Anyhow. . . there were things on the menus in the a la cartes that we still wanted to try!El Gaucho: This is the steakhouse in the evenings. The menu includes steaks, chicken, and I believe pork, among other things. The clarified beef stew is actually a very delicious beef broth. We ate here twice in the two weeks and enjoyed it very much. Service and food were very good. Try the Flaming fruit! There is ice cream surrounded by fruit, which they pour 151 proof rum over and light! It flames for about five minutes! Quite spectacular! Sakura: The Asian restaurant. We also ate here twice and although we were served promptly, the couple at the table beside us kept getting missed and did not even have their main course when we were finishing dessert. The food we found to be very good. I had the Peking duck one night and another tried some kind of chow mein. We also had wonton soup and appetizers, including sushi, which were all good. I can鈥檛 remember everything on the menus. . .wish I had taken pictures of them! Dessert was another kind of flaming ice cream, which was delicious!Chopin: This is an a la carte restaurant right on the water. It is actually another buffet with a very nice atmosphere, and a very nice selection of food, including a pasta bar and a grill station. They even had caviar and smoked salmon. Unfortunately, we found the service to be very slow and inattentive here, which was a big change from last year. The waitress we had last year was very on top of things, and was charming and a lot of fun, which added so much to the evening! A boat comes around at 8:30 with a piano player and singer. Very nice.Bella Pasta: The Italian restaurant. The food here was very good with a nice selection to choose from. We also ate here twice and enjoyed our meals both times. El Pescador: This is the seafood restaurant. Josello was our wonderful waiter and could not do enough to please us. The food here was also excellent and the staff was very attentive. We had some of our best meals here and I really can鈥檛 say enough about how great the staff were! Hispanol: The main buffet. We ate dinner here three times and there was always an amazing variety. There are theme nights, and our favourite was Seafood night. This takes place every second Saturday, so if you are there for only one week, you may miss it! There were shrimp and lobsters and fish and every kind of anything a person could want! There was also a very large variety of other dishes, as well as a grill to order station, and a pasta station. Amazing!!!! We found the service here quite good, as it was in most restaurants. Licey: This is the gourmet restaurant that is not included unless you are Platinum. This is our favourite restaurant. The staff are excellent, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the food beautifully presented, and delicious. The wine here is really good also. They are also quick to offer after dinner drinks such as Baileys, or whatever else you want. Between last year and this visit, we have eaten there four times and have never been disappointed! All in all, as far as the food is concerned, we had nothing to complain about. There are so many options that I don鈥檛 see how anyone could say that they couldn鈥檛 find anything they liked to eat! We were there at the same time as many people who are saying in their reviews that they were sick from the food. This did not happen to us, and as I said, we ate a wide variety of things, over a 2 week period, with no problems.ShoppingThere are many options if you would like to purchase some souvenirs, or coffee, or rum. There are a few shops in the resort. As well, on Thursdays, which is Dominican night, vendors set up at the resort. Right across the street from Bavaro Princess is a shopping centre with many little shops. You have to like bargaining to enjoy shopping in Punta Cana. I love it! Plaza Bavaro is just down the street a bit to the left, and there are more markets across the street from that. Down the beach about 20 minutes you can find beach markets, and if you go through them you are in Cortecito, which has markets and shops. Also down the beach to the left about another 20 minutes you will find more beach markets. What fun, shopping in our bathing suits! We liked going to the markets on the left because with the Platinum we has use of the sister resorts and could stop for a drink, or lunch, or a swim at any of these 3 resorts on the way there or back! At the Caribe Club resort there is a large cool water Jacuzzi, which is very refreshing after a long walk.EntertainmentThere is a casino at the entrance to the resort, but we never tried it. There are shows put on in the evenings, but really, the only one we saw was last year, the Lion King. It was surprisingly well done and we really enjoyed it. Most nights, after all the walking so much and staying on the beach all. . . not to mention shopping. . . we were too tired to do more than go to the lobby for our after dinner Baileys, and then walk back to the Platinum lounge, check our email, and then head to our room. It was nice to just sit on our terrace and relax before heading to bed for another early morning. It was truly a relaxing vacation. DepartureEven after 2 weeks, it was a little sad to leave. Check out took us 2 minutes. We called ahead to have our luggage picked up at our room, then headed over to the Platinum Lounge with our keys and safe lock. After that we had our last breakfast at Hispanol. We knew that Ivelissa had gone home for her 鈥渧acation鈥? so we were not expecting freshly squeezed orange juice in wine glasses. Much to our surprise, another waitress brought us just that! We were so touched at her thoughtfulness! A large air conditioned bus picked us up. When we arrived at the airport it didn鈥檛 take long to go through security. None of our bags were searched. The flight home was pleasant, and then there we were . . . back in the snow and cold! I love this resort, and the people. I wouldn鈥檛 hesitate to recommend this resort to anyone. I have read the bad reviews, and frankly, I don鈥檛 understand! I think that if you treat staff kindly, they will bend over backwards for you. Yes, we did tip, and we felt that they really deserved it. We also gave staff little gifts on occasion. Even when out shopping we would often ask the vendors if they had children, and if they did we would give them little toys or school supplies for them. It it so wonderful to watch their faces light up when they are asked about their families.We never had any stomach problems from the food, and the resort itself is beautiful. Obviously we must have liked it the first time to return this year for another 2 weeks.I know this review is a little long, but since I didn鈥檛 write one last year, I guess this makes up for it! If you are booked for a vacation at Bavaro Princess. . . go and have a great time. I highly recommend the Platinum upgrade. It is well worth it in my opinion!You can view my pictures from last year, and soon also the ones taken this year at:http://community.webshots.com/user/eddicatCathy  Eddie Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.

<Content>Beautiful hotel  Punta Cana, DOminican REpublic; Bavaro PrincessMarch 4 - March 8, 2006Reviewer: Trip Advisor, Long Island, NYMy wife and I recently stayed at the Bavaro Princess inthe Punta Cana region of the DOmincan Republic. This was our first visit to that country, although we have been to the Bahamas and the Virgin Islands several times. I should preface this by stating that we look forward to returning next year. I usually find bullet points are the easiest means to submit and hopefully access information:*FLights- American and other airlines service the Punta Cana airport*Transfers - I generally find transfers included in a package to be a royal pain, and prefer to use local transportaion. The transfers included in my Travel Impressions package proved to be no exception. Trip from airport on bus is about 45 minutes.Hotel - excellent check-in, bellman, front desk service. Room well appointed and clean upon arrival, maid service quite good on a daily basis. Hotel grounds are beautiful in that they've maintained the tropical/mangrove feel to the area. There is a small nature trail/park in the center.Pool/Beach - gorgeous. Clean and well maintained. Sometimes tough getting an umbrella after nine am, but if you look around one can usually be found.Food/beverage - Oh well. Buffets are, um, plentiful.Sit down meals are hit or miss. Regarding wine, for example, the word merlot is totally unknown. Choices are red, terrible, or white, awful. Local beer is pretty good. Soda is sweet/flat, but perhaps that's the way it's mixed down there. Don't expect 4 star dining, the food is not going to amaze you.Staff friendly and helpful.A nice vacation overall.

<Content>A simply Beautiful Resort We stayed at the Bavaro Princess on Feb 2nd-Feb 9th. We all had a wonderful time. Prior to my departure I was a bit uneasy about visiting this resort because of some really terrible reviews that I saw on TripAdvisor. After staying there though, I've come to the conclusion that these previous trip advisors must have stayed at a different resort or are just very high maintnanced.Our flight from Toronto arrived in Punta Cana at about 10:40pm. We had no problem with this, however I should worn future travellers that at this time there are usually another 2 flights that have landed and there are only 2 security personell stamping your passports. One thing that I would also advise is once you arrive at the airport, go to the middle desk and get your blue traveller information card. This is not your tourist card. You have to fill this out once when you arrive and again when you depart. We finally got to our resort at around 12:30am and check in was very fast. Within 10 minutes we were picked up and taken to our rooms. There were 4 of us and we had requested 2 rooms in the same villa. They managed to put us in the same villa, dispite the fact that the hotel was booked solid.The rooms are just beautiful!! We had a problem with our AC the first night, but they sent somebody right away to fix it. They're exactly what you see in the brochure. We didn't bother with the VIP, but from what I heard and saw its not really worth it. Keep in mind that this is a very large resort. They have a trolly, however it only picks up 9 people at once and it stops operating after 12:00am.We were lucky to be in the midst of everything (building 19). We were a 5 minute walk to the beach, pool and lobby. Those staying close to the lobby or beach had a good 10-15minutes to walk across the resort. Are room could have been better if we weren't as close to the septic tank, but luckily we weren't directly next to it (try not to stay at buildings 20-22).The food was very good. You have to keep in mind that no matter what its not going to be the food that you're used to, but compared to many resorts that I've stayed at it was overall very good. I would recommend Chopin and Bella Pasta. I wasn't crazy about the Argentian Steakhouse. Also there's a nice sports bar/restaurant across the street that had amazing food. They even had Heinz ketchup!! I would highly recommend it. There were a lot of complaints about waiters not speaking english. This is mostly true, but you really have to make the best of it. Face it, you're in a spanish speaking country!!The staff was very friendly. Cesar and Wilson we're the funniest. They really try to keep you active, they even convinced my sister and I to participate in a beauty pageant! They are all hard working and very funny.The trip overall was great. Yes, we had a few mishaps but the good outweighed the bad. Remember, you're going to the Dominican Republic, not Aruba or St Lucia. You really get your money's worth here and more. I would highly recommend it.

<Content>Common Theme...FOOD POISONING!!! My wife and I stayed at this resort Feb. 11-18. We upgraded to the platinum which really wasn't worth the bracelet it's printed on! Awesome beaches and great weather. But take your own food! As with many of the reviews on this site, I too got sick and had to go to the hospital. I swear about every 3rd to 4th person I talked with at the resort had been sick or their spouse was. I'm left wondering if the resort gets a cut of the money the doctor at the resort charges and the same goes for the hospital. I know saying that sounds funny but there was a lot of sick people there when we stayed. The food,drinks and customer service was not good at all. So your paying huge $$ for the view and salty water. I spent 10-12 hours talking with the resort and my Apple rep. while at the resort once I got sick and got nothing! The Apple rep. was worthless and didn't do anything for me unless I wanted to book an excursion then they're your best friend. We did meet some nice people that went and stayed at the Iberostar and said it was all great. This resort is rated at a 5 out of 6 and I think it's more like a 3 because you'll be in your room half of your trip due to sickness.

<Content>Sailing-painful Just came back, was there 2-26-06 to 3-5-06Objective: beach, pool, tennis, sailing, clean room, family fun, get fed.Travelers: My wife and I in our 40鈥檚, 5 year old sonPrevious experience: Mexico, Antigua, BVI鈥檚, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Turks  Caicos, Florida, Jamaica, Costa RicaScale : 1-5Beach: 4 of 5. Beach is nice, fine sand, the surf is pretty strong though, too strong for the little ones. This whole stretch of beach is lined with hotels all the way, and the beach is very busy. If you鈥檙e looking for solitude, go elsewhere. Yes, lots of topless. Always found chairs.Pool: 4 of 5. Main pool is clean, mid size, seen bigger ones, and smaller ones, but considering the size of the resort, this is a little small, can get crowded. Always found lounge chairs. 2nd pool by lobby definitely quieter, but smaller and not as clean.Grounds: 4 of 5. Grounds are nicely manicured. Is a large and deep resort. Yes, a 10 minute walk from beach to lobby, we don鈥檛 mind the walk, since the kid get to see the parrots and iguanas in the mini-zoo. We noticed trolleys are frequently full, so get into scrambling to get on situation. Not very handicapped friendly grounds, frequently no ramp assess.Rooms: 4 of 5.The rooms are clean and the cleaning ladies does a reasonable job cleaning. Looks just like the pictures. The original designs are really quite nice. But it is a little dated and old now and could use some upgrading. My wife is pretty picky and it passed her test. We were in building 50 initially and wifey wants to move closer to beach, so on 3rd day we got moved to building 03 down by the beach, after she harassed the crap out of the front desk guy (bless your soul Amigo Pablo). Both rooms are fine. There is sewage smell in both bathrooms however, and that settled with opening the bathroom window and my wife stuffed towels over the bidet drain and the floor drain, somebody didn鈥檛 know how to do their plumbing! We passed by building 19-22 area, the smell is bad around there!Watersports: 2 of 5.This is where I really have a beef with this place. I love sailing hobie cats. This place advertised free watersports. Well it鈥檚 not free, $20 for 鈥渆quipment insurance鈥? Well it鈥檚 not so much about the $20, I鈥檒l gladly pay the $20, it鈥檚 just the principle of it. If it鈥檚 not free, don鈥檛 say it鈥檚 free, it鈥檚 false advertising. And then the run around! First day arrival, go to the beach watersport hut, told have to make reservation and for next day only, and then need the $20 insurance for the week. Wasn鈥檛 doing to let this ruin my vacation. Went back 2nd day and paid my $20 with a smile, they took my money and then they told me the wind is strong to sail. OK, it was a little breezy, fine, wasn鈥檛 going to argue with them. Went back the 3rd day, perfect sailing day, and they gave me this BS again about too windy! I mean there are several sailboats out there from other resorts! So now I鈥檓 a little peeved. So they finally told me to come back in the afternoon and told me not to tell anyone, that I鈥檓 just testing the boat鈥hatever. Finally got to sail in the afternoon on the 4th day, now 陆 my vacation is gone鈥ave the boat boy a couple of dollars on the way out. Now sudden change of attitude, for the next 3 days, got to sail everyday! No hassles! Just showed up, they waved me right over, push the boats straight out right away! Similar story around many other things around the resort including the tennis courts, the restaurants, etc. Tipping helps. The actually sailing part: there鈥檚 actually a lot of coral reefs along this stretch of the coast, requiring a little caution, it can get a little shallow, the rudder hit bottom quite a few times, and also you can get quite big surfs around these spots, can get drenched at the least, trouble if you鈥檙e not careful. I saw one hobie cat went turtle. If you鈥檙e not sure, hire the boat boy to take you out for $10. That鈥檚 what I do for my wife, since she doesn鈥檛 want to go out on her own. The other thing to watch out for is the others, the fast power boats with the parasailings, banana boats, the windsurfers, the other sailboats, like I said before, it鈥檚 a pretty busy stretch of beach. The water is great by the way, very warm.Tennis 3 of 5Clay courts x 3. well maintained, staffed. Have racquets and balls(old). Needs reservations again. Again if you tip the ball boys, makes life easier. No facility for arranging partners. Gets hot 10am to 5pmGym 4 of 5Fairly well equipped. No reservations required, as always empty. Spa next door looks pretty nice too. Has Sauna and whirlpool.Food 3 of 5As been already extensively discussed by other reviews, here鈥檚 our 2 cents worth: the usual flair of Caribbean all-inclusives. Not your N. American fine cuisine, if that鈥檚 what you expect, go somewhere else. By all-inclusives standards, it鈥檚 still really only fair. We by no means starved, did always find something to fill the tummies. And none of us got sick. I just about ate and drank everything except tap water. My wife is more picky eater and she still always find something to eat.Breakfast-Hispanola 鈥?the main buffet, seems to have more selections, and they have fresh squeezed juices. We especially like the omelletes. The El Gaucho by the beach is also open, we find the food wasn鈥檛 as good, and no fresh juices.Lunch-Hispanola has the usual buffet. The Hamburger at MacPrincess was pretty good, although the line up can be quite long, the hot dog WAS nasty! But my kid ate it. We didn鈥檛 try the buffet at El Gaucho.Dinner-Hispanola is pretty miserable foodwise. Chopin is a good alternative for buffet, better food, need reservation. Bella Pasta was our favorite, the O鈥檇euves was pretty good, and the boglonese was pretty good. The Argentinean steak at El Gaucho was above average. Sakura has decent eggroll and sushi appetizers, but then it鈥檚 downhill fast from there on, the peking duck is anything but. The rest of the entres were more like chop suey drowned in soya sauce鈥? El prescaher(?) the seafood restaurant was the worst, the lobster tail tasted like it has been dead for a week and is already decomposing鈥lthough we met some fellow travelers that said they liked it.OtherService in general is about a 3 out of 5. I鈥檝e seen better, I鈥檝e seen way worse. And a smile and an Hola helps. And tipping a dollars helps even more. I don鈥檛 blame them, if I have to serve 1500 (sometimes obnoxious) customers everyday and make $150 a month, I don鈥檛 know what my reaction would be.There were complaints from other travelers about the Europeans, well I have problems with this North American guy either from USA or Canada, wearing an Infiniti cap (a Infiniti dealer?) just bug right in front of the burger line as if the rest of us doesn鈥檛 exist, and then at breakfast, this English speaking woman just jump in front of the omellete line. It just go to show idiots can be from anywhere. I think in general, the bigger the resort, the more likely you are going to run into these situations, and this is a pretty BIG resort.If you attracts bugs like I do, better bring bug juice. Didn鈥檛 bother my wife or my kid, but I got a few bites, and I don鈥檛 think it was from mosquitoes. Mostly in the evening when it鈥檚 bad.If you don鈥檛 like to wait or line ups, better get the VIP package or stay clear of this place. You have to line up for the a la carte restaurants in the morning. You have to line up for the hamburgers at lunch. Kind of have to wait for everything, didn鈥檛 bother us, we have slowed down to Dominican time, but if you鈥檙e the hyper type, that may drive you crazy.Kids club is pretty small. We didn鈥檛 use it much. We wound up in the pool playing with our 5 year old most of the time.Weather: 6 days sun, 1 day torrential down pour- the whole place was kind of flooded afterward, kind of fun to sip your drink in the pool amidst the rain.Drinks 鈥?we are not big drinker, presidentale was fine for us, the mixed drinks are pretty syrupy, too sweet. The coco loco and banana Mama were ok.Kids 鈥?there were quite a lot of kids, fairly family oriented place.In general, I鈥檇 say this resort is a 3-4 out of 5.Our worst experience this trip is actually our flight home on US Airways. When we got to the airport, there was a mile long line up, so after lining up for an hour, we found out that their computer was 鈥渄own鈥? and everything is on paper, and then they couldn鈥檛 find my son鈥檚 and my ticket, and wound up assigning the 3 of us different seats in opposite ends of the plane. When we finally got on the plane, the captain came on, and said they couldn鈥檛 fuel the plane. Something about the wrong valve or something, and then apparently they spilled gas all over the place. I mean, what kind of airlines will send their planes to a foreign country without first checking out if their planes can be serviced first!! And they have daily service too! No wonder US Airways went bankrupt! So after fiddling for 2 hours, before we finally get on our way, and of course now we have missed our connection. And they put us up in this Windham Garden, now that鈥檚 another review!! We didn鈥檛 get to bed till midnight, and then has to be up again at 4am. All in all that was a miserable return trip. It was so chaotic that it actually traumatized my kid, he was so worried that we鈥檒l never be able to get on a plane to get home, and was balling his eyes out. He was SO HAPPY when he got home! And he said, 鈥淒addy, we are NOT going on a trip EVER AGAIN!鈥?br/>

<Content>Overall a good resort for the price! We traveled here with our two kids (5  8) from Feb25-March 4th. We have stayed at Sandals Resorts and an Iberostar in the past while vacationing in the Caribbean. While this is not as nice as those resorts and certainly not a 5 star resort, it does deliver a lot for the price! We had fantastic weather. The beach and pool area are great with food, bars, activities and bathrooms all conveniently located. The way the rooms are set up is great but they are dated and need some fixing up. While I am not a neat freak, I really felt the maid service was bad. I don't care about flowers and towels that are made into animals but I do want my room clean and enough towels for all of us. Room location does seem to be key at this resort. The walking was not a problem for us--I can only see people complaining for two reasons--either they are lazy or got a room in the very back of the resort. I objected more to constantly having to avoid the little shuttles running me and my family over while we were walking. The septic smell over on our side of the resort was a problem--disgusting! We were pleasantly surprised by the food(our experience is that most all inclusive food is marginal). It was not gourmet but we were happy. I liked that the pasta station was always available at the buffet and I think it's great for kids too! Getting reservations at the restaurant was a joke! We were always there right around the time when they opened and still could only get 2 reservations. It is true that the restaurants wouldn't be that filled when you did get in! We were not able to use any of the water sports while we were there as it was very windy and choppy most days. There was also a lot of seaweed for half the week--when it cleared the water was great! We went on 2 excursions. The marianarium was worth it but I don't recommend Manati Park. Their brochure is misleading and I was disappointed in Apple Vacations for promoting this excursion. There are no sharks, petting zoo etc. as you see in the brochure--tourist trap. The drive to and from the excursions and airport showed us how poor, filthy and unattractive Punta Cana is when you aren't at a resort! I didn't find the Dominican people overly friendly even though I spoke Spanish whenever I could. The shows start too late for kids--The Lion King at 10:00 at night!! We didn't use the kids camp and it was run down looking(broken swings etc.) I wished the animation team would have had some organized activities for kids in the pool/beach area(it was all for adults). Despite some problems, this was a good vacation.

<Content>interesting... We were scheduled to stay at the Melia Caribe, but all our friends got bumped to this hotel b/c they booked online and Melia bumped 67 overbooked rooms to other hotels. (everyone that was bumped had booked online instead of through a travel agent) We booked through an agent, but wanted to be with our friends so we requested to go to Bavaro. The grounds are amazing, so we were encouraged. There is wildlife allover...if you have kids, they will love it! The room however, was dated, dark, and old. It definately needs updated and fixing up. The service was hot  cold. There were many times that we felt lied to. The food was fine. The beach is amazing. Wouldn't go back, but we had fun.

<Content>great beaches and people We stayed @ the Bravaro Princess from Feb26 till Mar 3rd -- The staff were super - the grounds beautiful as well as the beaches-- The food -well we have had better at other All-inclusive but was not to say terrible-- The resturants were way under booked although were reported to be full -i.e. reservations for say 8:30 although there were plenty of vacant tables - you could not enter until exactly 8:30 (and this was a buffet).Had read other reviews before we got there about having to walk and waiting for Trams -- we enjoyed walking everywhere -- the scenery was beautiful and the walks enjoyable.Took a tour ( Bravaro Rampage ) was excellent and a Snorkling tour ( Caribbean Festival) Also was super .Went Deep Sea fishing caught nothing lol but had a great time.

<Content>Not again. We have just returned for Bavaro Princess on the 7th of March. The grounds were nice, beach beautiful, and weather great. The fronk desk, the lobby bars and the restaurant's reservation desk, all seemed rude and could care less. No lost in translation, just rude.It just seemed like they all were robots. Except the pool bartender and the burger stand cook. There was security everywhere, which was nice, but made you wonder.The buffet's were bad, really really bad. Other restaurants average. Nighttime entertainment was average as well. You have to hold (placing a beach towel on a chair) a nice spot on the beach( or pool)before 8:30am or your left with a bad place to lay out in the sun. Before we left (2 weeks ago) this resort was 13th, now it has dropped to 21st!Never again. Good luck

<Content>Nice place to vacation Our family of four (boy 7 and girl 4) and another family of four (7 year old twins) just returned from a seven night stay at the Bavaro Princess. Overall, we had a wonderful time. The resort has nearly 900 rooms and is a VERY LARGE resort. It takes approximately 15 minutes of speed walking to go from the front lobby to the beach area, thus, the location of your room is an important consideration!(there are shuttles but they are often crowded at peak times and you end up fighting for a seat!) We chose the Platinum upgrade. This supposedly provides you with a larger suite (all the rooms except those in the hotel are suites), closer access to the beach, access to a small but lovely lounge that has free internet access, concierge service and food/drinks 24/7. Additional amenities of the platinum package include massages, one free motorized watersport (they will tell you that its really only for snorkeling but if you press the issue, you can enjoy any of the motorized activities), three cigars (again...must ask for them), complimentary dinner at their fanciest restaurant and the opportunity to visit their sister facilities. It also allows you to have Budweiser beer instead of the house beer at all of the bars. We enjoyed all of these amenities except for visiting the other facilities (they would not permit eight of us to go to dinner at the same restaurant at any of the other resorts...the maximum is four persons). If you use these amenities, the platinum upgrade is well worth the money. The beach is big and beautiful. We had no difficulties with getting chairs despite the hotel being pretty full. The pool is fair - no lazy rivers, no waterfalls or jacuzzi's but there are wading areas for smaller children and a bunch of rocks where the children enjoyed playing. The kids program is merely fair. There is a kids club located right off the beach and has nintendo, a miniature pool table, seesaws and swings but the actual program lacks structure and the staff was not as attentive as other clubs we have sampled (this is our third all-inclusive). Prior to our vacation, we had planned to seek babysitting service at least one night for our children but decided against it as we did not feel comfortable with leaving our kids with any of the staff for an extended period of time. Service from staff was fair at best. We had great difficulty putting in drink orders during our ala carte dinners and asking for anything other than what was on the menu. We thought this may have been due to the language barrier- our spanish is poor and most of the staff knew little to no english despite being around hotel guests. Overall, the food was excellent. We did not try the seafood restaurant after being told by at least 4 different families to avoid it. The Asian restaurant was fantastic (thumbs up by all eight of us) and the steak house served delicious food but our 8:30 seating resulted in a 10 pm dinner...which is too long for a casual restaurant!)Chopin is a buffet but classier and less crazy than the main buffet where you need no reservations. You are not permitted to take food out of the main buffet and they will not serve you a drink in the main lobby unless you have a shirt on (and this includes women who have one piece bathing suits with a bottom coverup)The gift shop has a wide range of items, some of which are reasonably priced and some that are outrageously expensive. We bought children's goggles for about $6 per pair and a bottle of SPF35 suntan lotion for $21. A can of Pringles chips costs $4 per can. Just across the street from the hotel, there is a cute and clean shopping mall. There is a pharmacy there and the prices seemed to be more reasonable. During our stay, we helped to celebrate the Dominican Republic's Independence Day. This was a grand affair with a big parade and party. Our children were given costumes and rode on floats. It was a fabulous and unforgettable experience for our kids!Like many all-inclusive resorts, there is not a lot to do at night except to watch the show. The program each night began with a kids program/disco at 8:30 and then followed with a variety of things and then an adult show at 10. The shows were cute but mostly your basic stuff (ex. men vs. women, ms. punta cana, impersonators, karaoke). Aside from the kids disco, there were no nitely supervised kid activities which disappointed us. In summary, we had a fabulous time but if we decide to return to Punta Cana, we will probably consider a resort that has a better children's program, such as the Sunscape Beach.

<Content>Lovely vacation My sister and I went to Princess for a week and had a lovely time. The food was excellent, the resort is gorgeous, the people are friendly and the beach is absolutely spectacular. Everything is well organized and they have many terrific activities which we enjoyed. We definetly will go back with our families and share the beauty of Punta Cana at Bavaro Princess.

<Content>Beaches are beautiful We just stayed at the Bavaro Princess Suites and Casino in Punta Cana, and we were very pleased.  The weather was absolutely perfect, 80-85 everyday, with rain only at night, so we felt very lucky.  When we first arrived at the resort we were a little overwhelmed with the size of the resort, but we quickly adjusted and found our way around very easy. They have constant shuttles to take you around the resort, but we didn't use them much. The walking did us good since we were eating more than usual. The food was very good. There were plenty of selections at the buffets, we never went hungry. We ate at 4 of the 7 restaurants, and they were all good, service there was a little slow, but we didn't have anywhere to get to, so we just enjoyed. Most others there were pleased with the restaurants also. Getting reservations wasn't that hard like other places, so we thought that was nice too.  The rooms were very spacious and clean. The maids did a nice job getting us extra cerveza if we needed it. Our toilet did break one day, but they fixed it promptly.  We would come back here, we have nothing really to complain about, we had a very nice, relaxing vacation, the resort was very nice, the beaches are beatiful, the Dominican's are very friendly. Wished we had a few more days there. It was wonderful.

<Content>Extremely unprofessional front desk service My fianc茅 and I stayed for 6 days at the Bavaro Princess during the month of February to check things out before we book a family reunion for June. Let me first say that we have traveled extensively throughout the Dominican Republic (DR) and am writing this review taking into account the nature of the DR. You must understand that most places you go or stay at are trying to do their best to please you, but when you pay to stay at what is attempting to be a 鈥渜uality鈥?hotel, you expect at the very least not to be ripped off too badly.  My fianc茅 and I knew we wanted to stay an additional day at the Bavaro Princess, and when we checked in we asked the gentleman at the front desk (Julio) if this was possible. He checked his computer and confirmed that there would be no problem and told us to contact our travel agent to book the additional night. At day 3 we contacted our travel agent and made the arrangement. I again asked the front desk (Pablo) if there would be a problem and the man again checked the computer, and said 鈥渘o problem鈥? Then late on the evening before we were to leave, my agent called me and said that the hotel rejected our extra-night reservation since the entire resort was 鈥渂ooked鈥? Since we had already changed our flight (and they knew this since Julio explicitly asked me if we had done so), I felt the hotel had pulled a switch in order to exploit a minor amount of money from me. I contacted my travel agent and he said it sounded like they just wanted to charge me the full $360 rate instead of the $250 I agreed to pay earlier. Sure enough, my suite 鈥渂ecame available鈥?when I volunteered to pay the $360鈥?what else could I do 鈥?they had successfully conned me. I wouldn鈥檛 have minded paying the trivial $110 dollars extra is they had just asked 鈥?but they lied to both me and my agent rather that to just tell the truth. My only satisfaction now comes from canceling my $12,000 US reservations that I had made for June as part of a family reunion. My agent and I are now looking for a new location. Fortunately, there are dozens and dozens of alternatives, in Punta Cana.  I can鈥檛 believe the head-quarters for this hotel would approve of their front desk people 鈥渆xtorting鈥?a petty $110 in lieu of the fact that they lost a $12,000 reservation (and that figure is looking very conservative). But I guess they figure they can just rebook the lost suites. But I would think (or hope) that such unprofessional practices will eventually begin to hurt their bottom line. Just be careful and don鈥檛 trust anyone at the front desk at this hotel. They鈥檒l tell you anything you want to hear just to get you to move on鈥?. Oh well, so much for expecting 鈥渁verage鈥?service.  Unfortunately, this single event is the only thing I will take from my visit to the Bavaro Princess. Shame since much of the rest of the staff worked very hard to do their best, and a couple of unprofessional front desk people could ruin all their efforts.

<Content>Great value/beautiful beach; recommend the VIP option We just got home last pm from a week at the Bavaro Princess. I was just checking the site as we were reminiscing about our wondeful trip and was dismayed to read all the negative reviews-some of these had concerned me prior to travel and I had actually considered changing our hotel choice. I am really glad we did not.This was our 12th trip to the Carribean-we stay primarily in 5 star resorts-last year we stayed at Sandals in St. Lucia.Although this is not on par with that, it was a great value and has one of the nicest beaches we have been to in the DR.The high points: beach is wide, super clean and many palapas to shield the sun-easy to find an empty one almost any time of the day and the resort was full for our stay. The VIP lounge was great-Adrianna was wonderful-booked all our reservations when we checked in and we could get unlimited bottle water there every day for the beach-very convenient.Another VIP option included room service-loved this for breakfast and late afternoon champagne/cheese, fruit+ bread on the terrace-we did this almost every day!The food was overall adequate for an all-inclusive; some was wonderful=Cafe del Mar on the beach ($60 extra per person but includes choice of good wine bottles)and Licey. Buffets were okay-never felt sick in any way and liked the salad station (beach) and pasta bar (main). We do brush our teeth with bottled water whenever we are in the Carribean and use tons of hand sanitizer-esp. after handling money. My husband has a sensitive stomach and we both felt great the entire time.The cons were the room was a little dated(good location though) and worn and our cd player never did work correclty. The house wine was truly dreadful, so we ordered several bottles of wine-pricey but well worth it.The service was really very good. I think people need to understand that only select workers in the DR speak English and they are probably not being rude, they just don't have any idea what you are saying or want.You need to understand this before you go, and be okay with it. I tried my rudimentary spanish and was greeted with many smiles. $2 tips to your waiter and $3 day to the maid and turn down maid goes a long way.The VIP staff was always super helpful and even recommended and arranged dining at the Puntacana Princess one night with transport for no additional charge. Our ground transportation was delayed and the main guest relations desk was very helpful-this is who you need to ask for help, not the general workers.Hope this was helpful and I can truly recommend this resort for a relaxing vacation.p.s. many guests tried to upgrade to the VIP option while we were there and no one could-it is apparently sold out for at least March. Book this before you go if you want to get it.

<Content>Chance to rate two resorts Have a chance to rate two resorts in the D.R. as our travel agent booked us into the wrong resort for 4 days of our week trip.First resort was the Bavaro Princess. Food was great, beach and water awesome, rooms a little dreary and old. Not enough English speaking people to help you with problems.Bavaro Palace was much newer, beautiful grounds, colorful buildings, good food, and helpful staff. Beach here was also wonderful. Would stay at this one again. Golfing is good. Some very nice courses with wonderful scenery. Now, if you could just do something about the taxi drivers!! Scary!!

<Content>Read reviews before booking My friend and I wanted a short vacation to a beach location, and when the travel agent told us about the Apple Square Deal, we thought that sounded great. We did not know where we would stay until we arrived at the airport, and even then, we checked the Apple brochure, and the Princess looked fine to us. We learned later why the Princess had rooms available for the square deal.Our troubles began at the Punta Cana airport where, after claiming our luggage and giving it to the Apple Rep., it disappeared. We were assured that this happens all the time and that they would have it at our hotel and would send it to our room the same day. Apparently, there are several Princess hotels, and our luggage must have gone to the wrong one. We eventually found it in the lobby at 6 p.m.That was just the beginning. Every review I have read on this site confirms our experience. Yes, the grounds and beach are lovely. Yes, the configuration of the rooms is fine, but as someone said, poorly lit. BUT The staff is generally rude and not helpful. Our room was not ready at 3:00, so we had to wait until they assigned us another one. At check-in we were not given towel cards or told about the lock for the safe. When we called to request them, we were told that they would be brought to our room. Never happened. The food was just adequate, and every day we had to stand in line to make dinner reservations. If we had known about the fresh grill at the main buffet, we might have tried it. The shower sprayed water in every direction except the right one, and the sink would not drain. One day we returned from the beach to find that our keys did not work. The response from the desk was that we must have gotten them wet. No, they had just changed the lock. The next day after the beach, I returned to the room to find a maintenance man in the bathroom. He was fixing the toilet - which had worked fine. I explained about the shower and sink, and he did fix those. About the same time, someone arrived to spray for roaches. We had complained about one that jumped out at me from a pile of papers on the table. After much complaining on our part, the day before we left, we also received a bowl of old fruit. Maybe it was the same one as another guest mentioned. We didn't even get the card, so we don't know who sent it. It was one aggravation after another for the whole trip. We had to keep reminding each other that we had come there to relax and weren't going to let the hotel get in the way. Luckily we did not get sick. I agree with another reviewer. Bavaro Princess No. Punta Cana maybe.

<Content>Beware of Food Poisioning at this resort!!! My husband  I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from 2/16 - 2/24/06. At first sight the resort was beautiful, the rooms were decent and the beach was incredible. The food.....ugh. We both wound up with food poisioning on our 3rd night at the resort and were violently ill for almost 2 straight days. And we weren't the only ones sick either as you can tell by other postings here, plus almost everyone we talked to had someone in their party who had gotten ill from the food at this resort. Based on our experience I would not recommend this resort, nor do I plan to return to the Dominican. A majority of the staff at this resort were extremely rude outside of Maximo (bartender), Enrique, the sweet maid who cleaned our room every day, and the staff at the front desk--otherwise the staff tended to be rather rude. It's too bad too because the beach was absolutely incredible!!

<Content>Never Again My wife and I were at the Platinum Club All Suites at the Bavaro Princess, Punta Cana from January 12th to the 19th,2006. What was to be a 50th wedding anniverary celebration trip turned out to be the holiday in hell.On first sight it seemed well tended and inviting. At the registration desk they knew nothing about our request for a 2nd floor suite. Although we had already paid to stay in the Platinum section they charged us a further $324.80 US fds. extra for a so called deluxe second floor suite and after a very long wait we were taken to our room. We tried to settle in, but within a few hours discovered the TV did not work and did not after they fixed it, the toilet did not flush properly, the bidet was unusable,no drain stop in the tub, the steel sink in the kitchenette was corroded, one tap did not work, the living room screen was ripped and flapped around, the living room windows were dirty, and also under the bed. The wicker furniture on the patio was broken. The suite was shabby, dull and obviously had not been refurbished for many years. This resort was advertised by Air Canada Vacations as a 5* resort.Meal time was a horror. After eating once at the buffet,we found it messy and unappetizing. As a result I would walk to the Platinum lounge and pick up some fruit or pastry for breakfast, to eat with coffee we made in our room. We were directed to various restaurants for dinner, the Japanese and Lycee we enjoyed. The others were abysmal. We visited the fish restaurant twice. Our first visit was fine.Our second visit was totaly unsatisfactory. Our waiter mis-ordered our first request, it was totaly wrong. The the second likewise. The waiter then tried to persuade us it was something it wasn't.Although we drank only bottled water and cola and never went into the swimming pools. We both got dysentry, I also got and ear infection. With regard to the bottled water some of it was not in plastic sealed bottles, some had no name brand labels on them.While we were at the Resort we did discuss our feelings and concerns with the Resort General Manager Michael Goncalves. He did not come to the suite or send someone of authority to check out our comments. The day before we left we received a bowl of old fruit and a card hoping we had a nice stay.On the bus taking us back to the Punta Cana airport, the driver said he hoped we all had a good time and would return. With one voice, we all said NO NEVER. At the airport while waiting for our flight back to Toronto I canvased a family of four, all were deathly ill, their young son had, had to be taken to the hospital. Another couple both got dysentry and severe stomach cramps, another couple,the wife spent two days in bed after seeing the resort Doctor. She said she saw a long list of people all ill, who at been at the Doctor's office. Not one person I spoke to said they had a nice holiday, none would come back or recommend it as a five* resort.In fairness the Bavaro has a very nice beach and grounds. The Casino was a massive rip off.A final comment,the resort manager has written Air Canada Vacations advising that anyone who got dysentry, must have brought it with them. He called it travellers disease. He has stated it did not come from staying at the hotel. UNLIKELY!

<Content>Want to go back Myself my husband our friends and their daughter had a fabulous 2 weeks here at the princess. We all had a bit of stomach problem but most people over do things on holiday anyway (overeat and over indulge the alcohol.) All restaurants were very varied with their menus and there was always plenty to eat. Even though we had to queue it was not a problem as we are mostly morning people anyway. My friend sorted the restaurants out and I sorted the sunbeds.The staff from the gardener upwards were all friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Our room was kept immaculate. Those reviews that moaned about waiting for a train were bone idle the walk did you good and it only took about 15 minutes 20 minutes tops to walk from beach to lobby. As for the beach and the ocean it was magnificent and as others have said it would be hard to beat. We walked 2 or 3 miles every morning before it got too hot. I will not ramble on but this is one of the best holidays we have had and would come again. Just don`t expect the Hilton that`s not what it`s all about.

<Content>One of the worst vacations... One of the worst vacations of my life. First of all my daughter got so sick from the food that we ended up at the Hospital, you don't want to end up in a Dominican hospital, trust me. My daugter's friend got sick on the day we were leaving, so she had to be sick the entire way home, but at least she was able to go to an American doctor who diagnosed her correctly. They totally missdiagnosed my daughter and gave her medicine she didn't need. But I guess this is a hotel review, not hospital review, because I have some stories about the hospital.... Besides many people getting sick, the food was not very good, and actually the doctor in America said that people get sick because of improper food handling, meaning not washing fruits and vegetables. The restaurants were bad, service slow, we missed the show every night because after having an 8:30 reservation we got out from the restaurant at 10:45, and show ends at 11. I really don't mind missing the show, but kids wanted to see it.....The rooms were dirty, they brought a dirty cot for my daugter, but after I complained they replaced it. Service was OK only if you tipped, but sometimes on the beach if you didn't have dollars with you and you tried to get a drink it would take a long time to get served. I don't mind tipping, but I don't like it when a bartender is looking at your hands to see if you are holding a dollar before he approches you. A lot of workes were very frienly, but we had a few bad experiences. My husband went to the spa and asked for a towel, the wonam had a stack of clean towels but would not give hime one, she said you have to bring your own from the beach, but the beach is 15 minute walk from the spa, he told her that he didn't know and next time he would bring a towel if she could make an exeption and give hime one, she refused..... do I need to say more, this is supposed to be a 5 star resort, I think in USA this would get 3 stars max.I would also like to say that like everybody else I loved the beach, the water was beautiful and the sand was soft and clean. There semmed to be enough shade and it was very relaxing.Overall I would never go back to Dominican Republic again.

<Content>No repeat visit to Bavaro Princess in Punta Cana We selected this resort based the idea of an all suite hotel with many restaurant options.... The rooms were set up as suites, but lighting very poor, with no lights over by sofa and easy chair! Towels were thin and rough.Aside from the beautiful grounds, spectacular beach and lovely pool, there is not much else to give this hotel the 5star review which Apple Vacations gave it.I agree that the food was not good although we were lucky and did not get sick! The animation team wore shirts claiming they are fantastic...that is a joke. Very little effort was made to engage the hotel guests in any of the daily activities and the evening entertainment was Fair at its best, and at times in poor taste. This is our 4th visit to an all inclusive resort and of all, we rated this our least favorite. I wish I would have checked reviews before booking our trip.

<Content>We like it, we like it. Wow, a lot of problems in February it seems. Well, 4 of us(2 grownups, 2 kids -2 and 5 year old) stayed, survived and enjoyed Bavaro Princess February 20th through 27th. here's our look on things - TERRITORY 鈥?I think that鈥檚 one point of consensus, absolutely beautiful. Every morning a flock of peacocks greats you as you enter the main breakfast buffet. Impeccable grounds. The resort is huge and is not for someone who can鈥檛 handle a 5 minute walk, though the walk will include a sighting of flamingo and a couple of turtles. ROOM 鈥?ok at best, ala Holiday Inn; cute sleeping area I guess. They do include an umbrella in a room but not a clock. All the usual minor complaints 鈥?a bit damp, lousy water pressure, rooms painted by a blind man. But the fridge is stocked with free beer, Coke, Sprite, water; rooms have nice terraces, free safe(you DO need to ask for a key) and air conditioning works well. BUFFET FOOD 鈥?good quality buffet and our main source of nourishment. Some things that stand out 鈥?fresh fruit smoothies in the morning, made to order omelettes. grill station during dinner with several varieties of fresh fish and meat grilled to order. I had it almost every night 鈥?largely overlooked feature and way better than anything I had at so called gourmet restaurants. Semi-Sweet Sparkling Wine/champagne with dinner 鈥?better than either red or white. Kids mostly stick to hamburgers, pizza and french fries and there鈥檚 plenty of that.Hamburgers at a poolside buffet are especially good - fatty,juicy, more gigantic breakfast patties than hamburgers.GOURMET RESTAURANTS 鈥?let鈥檚 face it. I don鈥檛 think there鈥檚 a resort that actually delivers an authentic Italian or French or Chinese or Japanese cuisine. And they don鈥檛 do it here. Sakura is extremely popular but it鈥檚 horrific. Peking duck is a duck thigh covered by a combination of ketchup/barbeque sauce. All the soups are the same and it's magical soy sauce that separates Wonton soup from Shrimp Tofu soup. We weren鈥檛 mad, we were laughing, laughing hard and the staff WAS trying鈥?I think, at times it was hard to tell. WATER 鈥?had no problem with water or ice cubes. My kids were using tap water to brush their teeth and drank countless smoothies with no problems. I used Pepto Bismol once 鈥?when I ate a pound of tomatoes as a side dish to my grilled perch(did I mention the underused grilling station at the main buffet?).ALCOHOL 鈥?ordering name brand drinks is a waste; they are diluted horribly. After wondering for 3 days why I couldn鈥檛 get a buzz I finally ordered Stoli no ice and things became clear 鈥?I was drinking Vodka flavored water. So we switched to Rum and had a wonderful time from then on. I would recommend getting Rum straighta and getting a smoothie on the side. Mix it as you like it.BEACH 鈥?lots of space, lots of lounges; sea weed is hauled away by the staff each morning(unlike in other hotels), the sea is always a bit rough and thus unsuitable for kids under 6. As someone said earlier there are absolutely no fish or shells or anything else in the water or on the shore. You need no snorkeling gear.POOL 鈥?yep, to get a coveted seat under a shaded umbrella you need to get up early(8:30) and place your towel marking the territory. I did it every morning creatively placing a diving mask here and a book there. Again no different from other hotels.WOULD I COME BACK? 鈥?I liked the place, I liked the pool, I liked the staff, I liked the food(Peking Duck, yum) and I wasn鈥檛 crazy about the beach 鈥?sounds like a definite maybe.PS we came back a few hours ago and immediately ordered our favorite Chinese take-out, yum!!!!

<Content>Poor Customer Sevice-Lobby Desk-Food was terrible My husbnd and I arrived on January 31 to this hotel for 1 week to celebrate our 39th Wedding Anniversary.Our booking was not what we had paid for and after going through 5 Management Levels and 5 hours in the lobby we finally got a room. The higher the level we went the more rude the employments got. Freddy from the Platuim Club is quite the weapon.The weather was great thank goodness. The line-ups for lunch at the buffet by the ocean, were just unbelieveable and most of the time the hot food ws cold.We had friends arrive the day after us and they were staying in the platium club section, so we had them book the dinner reservations, because if we went to book our restervation 2-3 days in advance we were always given 10:00 P.M. sittings It is Freddy that take the bookings. Go figure.The dinners all taste the same amd many other guests agreed with us. Pasta-seafood-steak- all starts in the same kitchen-yukWe tried to speak to the General Manager of the Hotel and could not get past Rita-rude Rita. I have the name of the General Manager-Miguel Goncalves, and I hope he can get a message from this, on Customer Service and how your guests are treated is the best FREE advertising you can get.I would not recommend this Hotel. We have been to Dominican 5 times and this was the most expensive and the worst.S Caldwell-Toronto

<Content>Wonderful Vacation Just returned from a week vacation from 2/18-2/25.The resort is beautiful, the beach area is very large with plenty of lounge chairs, never visited the pool areas, the wait staff was excellent never encountered any rude staff as mentioned in other reviews. The grounds were very well kept with many natural surroundings and a nice mangrove area. The resort is huge and if walking is a problem for you, this could be a problem, the trams are usually full, but we did not use them, we were in villa 68 which is closer to the beach then to the lobby, the room was very nice, no signs of mold, hot water everyday, did have to run the water for about 5 minutes, never had to go to the towel hut for clean towels always had 2-4 towels in the room after cleaning. Food was just ok, but found something to eat, usually choose the food that I could see them prepare, omelets, eggs, pancakes, fresh juice for breakfast. They had a fresh pasta bar in the main buffet and beach buffet daily. Ate at the Bella Pasta, El Goucho and Chopin ala carts, hard to get reservations before 10pm at some of the ala carts. We were given this resort as part of a 5 apple square deal, and was not disappointed with anything

<Content>paradise alive We stayed at this resort from 2/12-2/22/06 and it was great! It was the first time for all of us in an All-Inclusive-Resort at all. The resort is huge(!) but the little train brings you whereever you want. The only down side is the smell of the trains when they pass you when you are on your way to the breakfast buffet through the natural jungle path, surrounded by all kinds of tropical animals. We stayed in a Junior-Suite (No 374 - great location) which I would strongly recommend since the hotel building is pretty far away from the beach.We have 3 kids (5  4 yrs. and 16 months) who loved the time there. We could let them run out of the suite and they played in the beautiful gardens, getting fresh coconuts from the gardeners. However, if you expect the Kid's Club to entertain your kid while you enjoy yourself - forget it. After we saw some kids sitting in front of a TV (which had a very poor receiption) we decided to keep them with us. So we really focused on our kids - and had fun!Food wise we were satisfied. Even my wife (a daughter of a cofectioner and hobby chef) didn't have much to complain, however the food was not the best of the world. The Asian Sakura restaurant was booked out every day very soon, so we found our way to book it two days in advace - and were dissapointed. The A/C madde us freezing and the food was really not that famous as you would expect. The sea food restaurant however was great, hey really cook fabulous. But to give our kids the chance to help themselves at a buffet we mostly decided to go to the Chopin which also has a nice boat floating around on a little lake an a guy playing the piano on it.The cocktails at all bars were extremley sweet, but the kids liked it anyway to order their own drinks - of course w/o alcohol.All in all it was a great time and I would go again. Maybe not next year, but sometime in the next few years.

<Content>Great vacation, more pros than cons Mark and Cindy, New Hampshire USA My husband and I and our 2 children (5  2) traveled to the Bavaro Princess Jan 29-Feb 5. We also traveled with another couple and their children (4  2). We flew out of Boston via Ryan Air with TNT. We all stayed at the Riu Bambu last year. My husband and I hadn't planned on a trip this year, but my friends had booked the Bavaro Princess as the price was right. On a very cold day three weeks prior to departure, I relented and booked aswell. Flight down: Uneventful, check in was smooth at Logan airport, good flight, arrived pretty much on time. Immigration and customs went smoothly. We traveled with birth certificates and drivers liscence and had no problems. We'll get passports for the next time as the entry and exit requirement are changing.Check in: After a 45 min uneventful trip from the airport with a stop at another resort to drop off people we quickly checked in. They give you your room key card, towel cards, safe key, map. I requested an additional room card and that was no problem. Rooms: I had some concerns when booking as TNT booked us a junior suite and from what I had researched, that meant the 2 story hotel portion near the back of the resort. I e-mailed ahead and requested a bungalow in the middle of the resort with king beds, 2 twins, on the ground floor, with the patios facing each other. We were in bungalow 42, good location, midway from everything, on the ground floor. Our room had 2 twins together instead of a king, but we didn't mind, they were actually pretty comfortable compared to last year. I requested extra pillows as well. I'm not sure if the e-mail helped as I never received a reply. We got rooms with patio's facing each other on the ground floor as requested. The rooms itself are very spacious, just like in the pictures. Bathroom was large as well and separated by a small hallway. While they are not 5 star and may need some updating, they were quite comfortable and the set up is a definite plus when traveling with children. There was a significant musty odor to the room, but we got used to it, although I had to dry-clean some clothes that I didn't even wear. As far as the maid service was concerned, it was never the same time of the day but if we needed anything I just went and asked. A couple of days I just exchanged my towels and didn't even bother to have her clean. The same for stocking the fridge. We like a lot of coke lite so I would just approach one of the maids, with a smile and a couple of dollars and I could help myself. We left candy and soaps and stuff along with money which was appreciated. They do have hairdryers in the rooms, small safe, a coffee maker and the TV got several channels so the kids watched cartoons in Spanish but apparently didn't mind. No problems with the a/c or water. On word of caution about the doors in the rooms which open up to the patio. Small children can open the doors by themselves!!! We found this out the hard way on our second morning as we got up and the kids were missing. The groundskeepers were out front, trimming the palm trees and getting the coconuts and my 2 little escapees decided to go investigate the noise. Talk about a heart stopping parent moment. Luckily they were just out in front of the bungalow watching. After that, we made sure the lock was child proofed and had a velcro latch we had brought from home as well. :) Also, bring a clock if you want to know what time it is or need an alarm. Grounds: Absolutely gorgeous. Huge lobby with lots of sitting areas. Public bathrooms are sparkling. Always someone trimming, pruning and cleaning. This is a very large resort that requires a lot of walking or getting a ride from the trolley (golf carts). We actually walked most of the time as it was not more than 5-10 minutes to anything and the trolleys were usually full. I would think twice about this particular resort for anyone with significant mobility problems. In the middle of the resort, there are pathways through the mangrove with a mini-zoo. Actually just a few large bird cages and an iguana exhibit but provides a nice walk. We brought a stroller for our son which came in handy when he was tired.  Beach: What can I say, beautiful, powder sand, lots of loungers even when we got there, usually by 10 or 11 but you may have to move them if you want a certain spot. The shaded palapa's do tend to get reserved earlier. This is one sore spot for me as a lot of them would be unattended most of the day. The surf was a little rough but for adults its fine. I kept life jackets on the kids as a precaution as they tended to get knocked down, even by small waves. You can walk for miles in either direction. There were some topless sunbathers, not really a problem, and this wasn't nearly as offensive as large men in speedo's or thongs!Pools: Main pool is great. It's huge and great for the little kids as there were several areas that gradually sloped in. We brought buckets and shovels and the kids entertained themselves. We also brought a cheapo float for the pool and left it there. Only one small area was above my head. There are plenty of loungers around at anytime but the best ones to tend to get reserved earlier here as well. To the right of the pool, facing the ocean is where you exchange towels. They also have an area to hand paint ceramics for the kids, from $5 and up, hand painted t-shirts, henna tattoo's, $5 and up, and a few others for excursions. We didn't bother with them. The pool bar was a hit, even for the kids as they had frozen chocolate drinks. Hate to say it, but it was my 5 year olds favorite place. There is also another pool at the back of the resort, near the lobby that looked nice and quieter but we never got there.Watersports: they have boogie boards, kayaks, etc. Motorized sports are through Scuba Caribe. I did the parasailing with my daughter for $75 for both of us. We took the skiff out to the boat which was an experience as it was very choppy. I thought we would do this near the beach but they took us way out to sea but it was well worth it. Bars and beverages: There are 2 bars at the main lobby, one on the beach, and one each at the pools. We don't drink but I brought an insulated travel mug for my coke lite. Maximo at the upper level pool bar was great, never had to wait long, even when it was crowded, as dollar or two here and there seemed to help. There is a self serve dispenser at McPrincess/El Gaucho, the lobby pool bar and the beach bar that had soda, water and noncarbonated juice. I wasn't impressed as the soda was watery and the juice wasn't actually juice, it was more like fruit punch and kool-aid. They also had a beer tap and the frozen lemonade and pina colada machine at El Gaucho. I was also able to get bottled water from the lobby bars but not at the others.Food: Allright here goes, the main buffet, the Hispaniola, near the lobby has breakfast, lunch and dinner. The breakfasts were the best, wide variety, hot and cold foods, made to order omelets, waffles, donuts, however, there was usually a line for these. Lots of fresh fruit and fruit smoothies. The service was hit or miss, usually miss if it wasn't our usual servers, Carlos and Felix, they were great and very attentive. One thing I didn't like was having to order drinks at meals. Last year at the Bambu, you could help yourself at the buffet and they had a pot of coffee on each table and it was a lot easier than waiting. We never went there for lunch but went to El Gaucho/McPrincess near the pool and the beach. Usually when we were there it was very crowded and difficult to find seats, especially when we all tried to eat together. The have a made to order pasta bar which was the highlight. The McPrincess has made to order burgers, hot dogs and fries, just remember this isn't McDonalds, burger were interesting and I'll leave it at that. Next year, I'm bringing a bottle of Heinze ketchup as theirs is very different :( Again, very long lines for both which was somewhat of a problem with small children and having to wait. The buffet part had basically the same stuff every day. For dinner the first 2 night we went to hispaniola buffet. They have the pasta bar here as well, again long lines. They have a variety of different dishes, some were very interesting, rabbit and goat to name a few. One night they had beef that looked raw, I had them grill it and I still couldn't chew through it. You can make reservations in the AM for the a la carte restaurants but by the time we got up, most of them were booked or they only had the 10pm seating left. On night 3, we had reservations to Chopin. Beautiful location, however, it was another buffet with only slightly better food. The next night we went to Bella Pasta, the food was very good however, the service exceptionally slow. With 4 kids and a later dinner time it was not a very enjoyable night to say the least. We ate at the buffet for the rest of our stay. Overall, we did not starve, but I wasn't impressed with the food. Next time I would make more of an effort for the a la carte restaurant, heard much better thing about them. The food at the Riu Bambu was much better. Entertainment: We never made it to the shows at they didn't start till 10pm but the kids mini disco at 8:30pm was fun for the kids but a little repetative. They do have a kid's club but we never utilized it and they have various activities on the beach and near the pool.Royal Holiday: after leaving the main buffet after meals, the have representatives trying to get you to see their presentations. Basically, for price you buy points to use for future vacation. I had heard that you could get free things if you went, so one morning after breakfast, we got sucked in. I knew it was not something we were interested in but if its free, its for me. So for a half an hour of my time, we got a $100 credit for massages. My husband and I had 45min massages at the hut near the pool. Definitely worth it. The usual price was $70/hr, $45/1/2hr.Shopping: they have some shops in the lobby but they are way over priced. A 5 minute walk across the street from the resort is the Plaza Bavaro with a variety of shops. Souvenirs, cigars, coffee, paintings, jewelry, etc. You can haggle with them more over here. We got 5lbs of coffee for $20, 10 decent cigars for $35, t-shirts around $8. They are very pushy trying to get you to come into their stores but a firm no gracias will do. I also found someone to do my daughters hair, full head of braids and she only charged me $20. At the resort it was $50. They have vendors in the lobby on Thursday nights as well. I also know that there are a lot of Red Sox fans there so I brought some t-shirts and hats and bartered some of them and gave the rest away to bartenders, waiters and the maid. Casino: not bad, bigger than the one at the Riu, probably 20 or so tables, blackjack, 3-card poker, roulette, craps and a bunch of slots. I noticed a lot of people from other resorts there. They have a shuttle to come and go from the lobby and when I came back at 2am, they actually brought me all the way to my room.Departure: check out was a quick and simple process at the resort, however, the airport was another story. By the time we got there the line was a mile long and it took forever. And they tried to get us to pay the departure tax when it was already paid through our tour operator. By the time we made it through check in, immigration, security it was already departure time. Flight home was uneventful but they did lose one of my bags but is was delivered 8 days after we got homeOverall: We had a great vacation and it is what you make of it. Nobody got sick as a result of our trip. If your expecting food and service like the Ritz, then go to the Ritz. The food was not the best, but we didn't go hungry and could always find something, with that said, we would definitely go back in the future as the rooms and layout of the resort, the beach and pool, etc out weighed any food issues. Feel free to e-mail me to answer any questions.

<Content>Punta Cana, Yes...Bavaro Princess, No way!!! Our story is almost exactly as the other travelers described previously. My husband, two children (ages 8 and 7) and I traveled to the Bavaro princess from New York Metro Area over the February Winter break. I had been hoping for the best, in spite of the negative reviews that I had read previously. I wasn't expecting haute cuisine, but I figured for a so called five star resort that the food would be decent. I knew things were going to be bad when I arrived and tried to book the platinum package and was told that they were sold out. I told them that I didn't care about an upgraded room, that I simply wanted to pay the extra for the premium liquor and the ability to make the dinner reservations in advance (I could write another whole review about how screwed up the reservation system is in this place. The reservation system opens at 8 a.m. and by 9:30 a.m. all of the early reservation times to the least of the crappy restaurants are gone! The only thing opened is dinner at 10 p.m. You have to stand in line unless you have the platinum package.) I was told that they were sold out of the platinum package, period. We arrived at our room, which was supposed to have been ready. We had a filthy bed cot sitting in the middle of the livingroom. After an hour, they arrived to remove the cot (service is not a strength at this resort). I then went to take a shower and had the entire faucet to the shower come off in my hand. No one could take a shower and get ready for dinner after an afternoon of traveling. That took another hour to fix.The buffets, including the Hispanola (which is where the largest buffet is), the Chopin, which is essentually where everyone has to eat dinner the first day when they arrive because all of the reservations are gone, and the buffet by the beach where El Gaucho is are all AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!! The MC Princess should be sued by McDonalds for even trying to imply that what they are serving is hamburgers and hot dogs! The only thing that is edible in any of these places was the pizza, which was surprisingly good when it didn't have ridiculous things like corn and cut up hot dogs on it. My husband and I admit to being snobbish New Yorkers when it comes to food and dining, but we honestly came here with the expectation of the food just being decent and edible. It was neither. The Ala carte restaurants I'll rank in order:1. Sakura- The least crappy- Says it is Japanese but is actually almost all Chinese, except for the disgusting sushi that they try to serve in the beginning. If you like Chinese, you won't mind this place.2. El Gaucho- Better than Sizzler but not even close to Outback, let alone a decent steak house.3. Bella Pasta- Makes Olive Garden look good!!! I finally realized that the people who thought this place was good are the same people whose only exposure to Italian food IS the Olive Garden! Again, My kids ate pizza here, and my husband was in our room hurling his brains out from the seafood place the night before, which brings me to4. El Pescador- how anyone could make grilled lobster tails taste like a mushy tastless garbage, I'll never know. Red Lobster will seam like the finest seafood place you've ever eaten at after this one! In fact, a can of tuna will look good after this place! Nothing was good here, not even the dessert.Besides the food tasting terrible, it made all of us so sick. My 8 year old son was the first to get sick on the second night with violent vomiting, followed by violent diahrea. My husband was next with violent vomiting by the third day. I was not so lucky. By the third day, I had stomach cramps that would not go away for the entire vacation. I thought my youngest daughter(who is a diabetic and has a very careful diet) was going to be the only one to get away unscathed. On the last day, however, she began running a fever, and became ill on our first day home.I enjoyed many of the people who I met, and did not find the Europeans rude, with two exceptions- one person wrote of the Russians on their cell phones and this was very very true. Everywhere, loud conversations by the Russians. I will say, however, that the Russians were very friendly and nice. The second incident, I will not allow to cloud my judgement about an entire nation of people, but this rude, nebbish little balding Frenchmen tried to cut into the reservation line in the morning. Already in a pretty upset mood from, you know, the whole my family being food poisoned thing, I started yelling at this rude little man to get off the line. He pretended not to understand English, until the other people on the line also yelled. Even then, it took the man from the hotel who was making the reservations, to make him get off the line.I don't want to end this review on such a negative note, so I will end by saying that Punta Cana is spectacular. The beaches were absolutely amazing, pristine and clean. The Dominican people were very nice and worked very hard. We tipped the bartenders, our maid, and the people in the restaurants who gave us good service, regardless of the food. We did not, however, see too many people tipping. That is just wrong. These people work very hard. Our two favorite people, I need to mention, were Ruben and Melvin who work at the pool bar. They were the best, always had a strong drink and a smile.Bottom line, I'd never ever go back to the Princess, not even for free, but I'll do my research and find a better place to go when I return to Punta Cana!

<Content>Terrible Food Its not a good sign when 50% of your party gets some form of food poisoning at this resort. The grounds are nice, but the food, in addition to being unsafe, is terrible. Moreover, the alcoholic drinks were too sweet or made with sub-par alcohol.

<Content>Disaster My experience is very similar to the family who returned in February 2006. We were there Jan. 12-19, 2006.The food was terrible and my six-year-old son became so ill that he was transported by ambulance to the private hosptial. Thank goodness for travel insurance. I also became ill as did my husband. My 9 year old daughter was okay (besides her asthma issues due to the mould) but we brought a suitcase full of food for her due to a tree nut allergy. We were extremely careful with food and water and never ate at a buffet restaurant. My son was so ill at 2 a.m. that we needed some towels, blankets and sheets. We called housekeeping and the front desk to find out no one was available to help. A resort of this size had no staff working in the night. It was disgusting. They also claimed to ahve 24 room service, which is an outright lie -- it operates from 8 a.m. - 11 p.m.Yes, the resort was pretty and the beach was nice, but we, like many other families/couples travelling from Toronto, were sick and were just happy to get out of there alive. Several of travellers on our plane were violently ill. This was not Traveller's Diarrhea. One couple we met from Montreal became so ill on their third day of a two week vacation, they insisted Air Canada Vacations move them to another resort. Not much of a vacation and no, we would never go back.

<Content>Bring your roller blades Well if your going down to this resort be prepared to either roller blade your way around or the walking you do getting to the beach will do you good. Shuttle service to and from the rooms to the beach are a joke, 15 commuters pe trip and only 2 shuttles you can imagine the build up of riders and fustration levels, in no time you will be waiting for 20 minutes for a car and as soon as you think your on the next one someone walks out from nowhere and jumps on. Rudeness from a lot of Europeans and the service around some restaurants El Gaucho in the morning was miserable at best. Begging for coffee and juice was always a challenge and if you like your eggs well done in the morning this would be the place to go. The hotel and grounds are kept very clean and service will become more attentive once you start tipping them. Resort is much to big and the food is average but beyond that, the place rates a 6 out of 10. These comments come from someone who travels quite a bit and after staying at other Bavaro resorts in the past we would pass on this one next year. Internet service is the best way to communicate back home beats the telephone service any day. 15 min 3 dollars 30 min 5 dollars and 1 hour for 8 dollars. Dont forget to bring your roller blades.

<Content>food poisoning!!! we stayed at the bavaro platinum princess from feb 9th to 16th. This was one of the most beautiful resorts we had ever stayed at, and we travel yearly. The grounds, the rooms, the beach and pool were stunning.....but looks can be deceiving!  When we were shown to our room the first thing we noticed was the smell of mold, the second thing we noticed was that not only had we no water pressure, but our actual shower did not work. And this is what they considered the platinum suites of the resort! After complaining, we were given another room. As night fell and it grew cooler we decided to turn down the A/C because our boys aged 5 and 3 were cold. Well what do you know the A/C was not attached to the thermostat so we were unable to adjust it or turn it off! Finally at 2am the A/C was fixed. We were lucky in one sense that we had the platinum package in that we were able to eat every night at an a la carte restaurant and not have to deal with the main buffet restaurant every night which was below par. The buffet food was generally tasteless and their house wines were quite poor. Now, can you imagine no orange juice at a 5 star resort anywhere? When asked we would be given flat orangy pop. No apple juice either, only watermelon and pineapple, and banana juice. Good luck giving that to the kids!On our last day there all of us developed severe gastrointestinal illness, to the point that they wanted to hospitalize our 5year old son. Thank god it was the day of our flight because we barely made it out of there with me fainting at the airport and no end to our vomitting and diarrhea. Was it gorgeous? Yes, most definitely. Would I go back? No, i would never put my family at such risk again.

<Content>Beautiful Resort We stayed at this resort from February 8-15,2006. I must first start by saying the grounds at this resort are absolutly lovely. They are well groomed and just beautiful. This resort is one of the largest we have ever visited in the caribbean, there are trains that pick you up all over the resort and drive you to where you want to go we took the train at times but they do fill up quick so we chose to walk a lot the exercise probably did us good and it is so beautiful to walk the resort. We upgraded to the platinum oceanview the upgrade is worth it, our room was 347 and we were maybe 200 ft from the beach the other rooms that are not part of either the regular platinum or the platinum oceanview are very far away from the beach they are closer to the main buffet at the front of the resort. Upgrading also makes checking in and checking out a breeze, no lines. O.K. here are a few negatives, they say they offer premium liquor with the platinum package you can get it but you have to ask for it (no big deal) and they sometimes had premiun liquor at the platinum lounge but mostly it was regular house brands. Internet access is available in the platinum lounge and they have internet access at the main lobby for all other guests if I remember correctly it was around $10.00 for 5 minutes I could have cared less about checking e mail while on vacation but if it's important to you dont count on the computers at the platinum lounge that are free with the upgrade either the computers (2) are being used or when we tried to get on the satelite was down. Restaurants, the food we found was good, but we are not picky eaters and I am happy not having to cook or do dishes for 8 days. There is a smaller buffet on the beach that offers breakfast from 0700-1000 lunch and snacks throughout the day, it is less crowded than the main buffet and a lot less hectic to get your meal, all the meals we had there were very good and a huge variety. During the day they have hot dogs,hamburgers,a pasta bar and fresh fruits and many other choices. El Gaucho has great steaks but the waiters and waitresses were as roude as you can imagine I was truly shocked with the service at this restaurant but if you over look them the meal was very good. Bella Pasta restaurant was pretty good they have a wide variety of pasta options. Pescador is the seafood restaurant and this was very good. Licey was very good also but with the upgrade it did not cost us the additional 25.00 per person if we had to pay 50.00 for this restaurant we would not go, the food was good but not worth an additional $50.00. The Chopin is a buffet, they do have a boat that comes through with a singer and you can feed the fish in the water but the food was not all that great. The Asian restaurant was the best meal we had at a specialty restaurant BUT THEY COOK WITH MSG or something close to MSG which I had the pleasure of finding out I am alergic to, unfortunately I spent the last 2 days of our vacation with extremely swollen legs and feet I had to go to the doctor the day after we got home to get medication. My husband had no ill effects from the MSG. The main buffet for breakfast is truly worth going to they make fresh dognuts,waffles,omlets it is truly a very good selection of food for every meal and it is very good.The beach bar is great during the day Juan and Maria serve up a mean drink, I would suggest you bring a large insulated drink cup with you it will save you from standing in line more often than you want, it is busy there and at times takes a while to get your drink.The swim up bar is a ball, Ruben is as entertaining as they come he made our afternoon cocktail hour a lot of fun.The beach is beautiful, clean powder white sand and the water is very warm. There is an ample supply of beach chairs but if you want one of the many cabannas you need to get to the beach very early to claim one. There is a shopping area on the beach (if you are looking at the water go right and its about a 15 minute walk down the beach) There are a lot of shops there and they are willing to negotiate prices with you. We did find the prices at all the shops in Punta Cana more expensive than any other location we have visited in the Caribbean.All in all, we had a great vacation the people that work there are very friendly and always say hello to you. I would recommend this property for your vacation. I have included our e mail address if you have questions I would be happy to answer them the best I can.

<Content>A very enjoyable holiday I will try to make this short.... We stayed the week of Feb. 1-8/06. The resort was beautiful. As everyone reports, the grounds were meticulously maintained. After walking up the beach and seeing other resorts, it appeared to me that Bavaro Princess had the nicest beach. The beach was wide and the sand was thick. At another resort I noticed staff bringing sand to the beach by wheel barrow.The pools were nice. We discovered the pool by the lobby on the last day of our stay and it was a nice escape from the noice and the wind at the beach and beach side pool.The food in the buffet was OK. We did have better luck with Bella Pasta, our kids(3  6)loved it. The meal at Licey was nice, choice of dishes from 4 courses. All a la carte restaurants had slower service, not great for kids, but relaxing for adults.We found the staff to be exceptional. The beach buffet staff remembered us and would have coffee and juice on a tray waiting to follow us to our breakfast table. Show some interest in them and they will be only to happy to assist you. It doesn't even take a tip, if you ask them about their lives they will engage you for the rest of your stay. We learned they stay near the resort while working twelve hour shifts a day and some were as far as an eight hour bus ride from their kids. Bring a small spanish dictionary, it only takes one word for them to understand your needs.We booked the platinum club (our only option through Air Canada) and it was worth it. Check-in was fast and efficient. The dinner at Licey was nice but it also included unlimited room service which we found to be a nice change after three days, things you can't get at the restaurants, including Budweiser beer. You could also get real juice through room service and at the platinum lounge. You also benefit by having the beach towels in your room changed twice daily instead of having to go to the hut to get them. Our bath towels were also changed twice a day which gave us clean towels for our before dinner showers.Our room was probably the single best room available to the general public. It was in building 74, room 747, centre building, second floor, over looking the beach, a little weather worn, but otherwise very nice. The only down side were the busy trolleys if you were trying to get to an a la carte restaurant at the front of the resort. Leave a couple of extra minutes. We contacted the resort via email prior to our trip to arrange this room, which included a bit of a premium, but it was well worth it.All in all a great place. We would recommend it to our friends and go back should we want to visit Punta Cana again. Happy trails!

<Content>stunning having stayed in many hotels around the world this had to be my favourite. The rooms (of should i say suites) were stunning with more than enough room. anyway who wants to be in the room when you've got a gorgeous white sand beach and a relaxing pool to sit by? Being somewhat of a picky eater i was worried about the food, but witha choice of 5 restaurants i managed to find something every night. the main buffet was a bit risky with not a lot of signs saying what things were. The oriental restaurant Sakura was the nicest set on a lake and stunning to look at. The hotel was beautiful and you are never short of activities to do during the day. Personally i was happier on the sun lounger but the activities are there if you want them. the pool bar is great too, in the shade and always busy.  the only thing i didn't rate was the outside of the resort. A freind and i went out to the shopping centre on emorning and a couple we met came with us. The experinace was, shall i say...was an experiance. we initially went to buy a phone card as hotel rates are shocking, having entered the western union a police man with what can only be described as a machience gun procceded to point it at us and then at a chair so we decided to sit down. After that we learned we would have to go there everytime we wanted to make a phone call and thought better of it and left.  On the way back to the hotel we were bombarded with people trying to sell us things. i'v been to turkey and the people are like that there too but once you say no thankyou they accept it and move on. But the Dominican people didn't. they were trying to literally drag us into their shops. As a result we walked incredebly quickly back to the hotel and decided not to go out again. Which was a shame because there were some lovely things to look at but we being 19 and 20yrs were scared and didn't look.  we didn't let it spoil our holiday though and just had a relaxing time and a very enjoyable one at that. WOULD GO BACK TOMMOROW IF I COULD.

<Content>Not as expected My husband, daughter (2 years old) and myself just got back after a one week stay, Feb 4-11. The grounds, pool and beach are gorgeous. The food was decent. Our room was horrible. It was so musty and there was black mold all over the ceiling. It looked like someone sponge painted the ceiling in black. It was also growing in the a/c vents. We requested a room change and told they did not have any and to come back the next day. The next day, we weren't on the list and so on and so forth. We never got a new room. The service was not good either. The servers in the restaurant speak English, but refuse to. I can speak some spanish so we got along ok. They also were not very friendly. The bartenders were so slow even when there wasn't anyone in line. They also always seemed put out and all we ordered were cokes and pina coladas - nothing difficult. The beach was quite beautiful and there were plenty of chairs and huts. The food was ok, not bad. We always found something to eat and were always full. I would not go back to this resort or this country. The locals just weren't that friendly. We have been to several islands, and never been treated so unfriendly.

<Content>pretty hotel but Hotel was very pretty, beach was beautiful with alot of palm trees, pool lovely. Service was good. People not friendly - never smiled. Mostly spanish speaking - didn't understand english. Room was nice - but bathroom old. There was a musty smell in the bedroom which came from the air conditioning. Food was average - safe to order food from the grill. Ask for section (5) facing ocean or garden and ocean. Location is good and quite. Do not go to Chez Palace or LaFuente - You have to pay extra, not included in the all inclusive. Was absolutely not worth the extra money. Food at those restaurants were not good. Still this is a good place to go to rest and the price is right.Unless escorted- do not go outside of the hotel - not safe. Also expect a dirty island - very poor. Stay in your hotel and enjoy.

<Content>I would not go back First off we did not pick this resort, A family member pick this resort to get married at. A group of 16 people traveling from Calgary and Ontario. Travel Time great: 4 hours not a problem. The only thing was we had to be at the airport at 4:00am for our 6:30am flight. (A little hard with young kids) Once we got to Dominican the experience at the airport was quick and painless. (Bell Boys everywhere, just told them I was fine and took our own luggage to bus. Check in at Resort: Very slow, only one person working (1:00pm) Once we had our key we had our luggage sent to our room. Within an hour of arriving we were dressed and ready for the beach or pool. Resort and Beach: very Nice, Super clean and well maintained. Great for a wedding. Staff: Some friendly, they didn't really go out of the way to impress me. Most wait staff and cleaning staff spoke very little English. At time it was very difficult getting anything from them. For example we had to show her a towel and a pillow in order get more. Our room was stocked for 3 people and we had reservation for 4. We ran out of toilet paper and I had to go and find some more out side our area. Food: Very Blah, I found the cuts of meet cheap and very hard to chew. Chicken was always the leg or thigh (never Breast), Food always cold, except if you ordered and Omelet at the grill. A le Cart restaurant almost impossible to get into, unless you want to eat at 10:00pm. Desserts and fruit not bad. I found the food very high in Fats. Pasta Bar: Great, always hot.Drinks: No fresh squeezed OJ. ??? In a resort like that you would think that fresh juice would be available. Their version of juice was pop without the fizz, very sweet. Bar drinks were okay, make sure you ask for alcohol or you won't get any. Shopping: The prices for all their merchandise are a joke. Considering it is all in American Dollars, they try and charge a whole lot for nothing. Be prepared to barter, start your bid at half and don鈥檛 be afraid to walk away. My son had a great time (11 years old) - and he managed to get some great deals. Excursion out side of Resort: Diving day trip was great. The Scuba crews are great and very professional. We took the James Bond Power Boat excursion, it was horrible. The boats are in very bad shape, the life jackets need to be replaced and the staff should learn to speak English. During this adventure my boat was moored to a rope waiting for one of the staff to unhook us, as we wait patiently one of the tour guide boats looses control and smashes into my boat, lucky for us (my Daughter and I were not seriously Hurt) when we got back to the start (on Land) we tried to explain to the staff what had happened. No one could speak English. It was quite frustrating. We had to wait and speak with our travel representative (Signature Vacation). Again we had to struggle with that as well. We finally got a refund for two. We are now in the process of communicating with Signature Vacation on this matter. We want to inform people that if you decide to go on this excursion please think twice, it is unsafe and if something is not done about this soon, some one may be killed or seriously hurt. Overall Rating: 3.5 to 4.0 and that is only because of the Resort and the Beach beong so beautiful. I would rather go to Cuba.

<Content>great people We just returned from a week at the Bavaro Princess. We travelled on a Square Deal, so we didn't know which hotel we'd be staying at until we got to the airport on the morning of our departure. I'd been trying to outguess Apple and researching the hotels where we might have stayed. The Princess wasn't on of the ones I'd guessed at, so I knew virtually nothing about it. In other words, I apologize in advance if this review just rehashes what earlier reviewers have said.Arrival and check in: Smooth. Got our keys, towel cards, etc., and a bellman drove us and our luggage right to our room. But there were people in front of us in line who's rooms weren't ready. It seemed as if rooms were pre-assigned, so if you want a specific room or area, I'd suggest emailing or faxing your request a few days before you arrive.Grounds and rooms: Beautiful. The rooms are spread out over a huge area and a good distance from the restaurants. But not to worry-if you don't feel like walking, there are trams available every few minutes. There's a mangrove swamp in the middle of the resort complete with an aviary. We also saw lots of peacocks, domestic geese, ducks, hummingbirds, kingfishers and some chickens as well.All the rooms that I saw were suites. Ours was spacious and very comfortable and quiet (the entire grounds were quiet-they're spread out over such a distance that it never felt crowded and it was rare to see or hear neighbors).The pool was large enough that it never seemed loud or crowded. Plenty of chairs, so there weren't races every morning to put towels down to reserve them.The beach was fine white sand, also plenty of chairs, warm water and some decent waves due to the wind. Also, if you feel the need to get off the grounds, there is a casino at the end of the driveway, a golf course around the corner from that, and just across the street, dozens of souvenir shops.Food: Excellent. Plenty of variety at the buffets-you could be as adventurous or conservative as you wished regarding the choice of food. It was always possible to get some grilled dorado, grouper or chicken, and it was always outstanding. Also freshly made pasta was available. Something for everyone. As far as the a la cartes, we had no trouble getting a reservation. One needn't even stand in line if willing to eat at the 10 PM seating. Those rarely if ever filled up. We ate at the pasta restaurant once and the seafood place twice. That my wife, who almost never eats seafood, suggested using our last a la carte meal at the seafood restaurant should tell you how good it was.Staff: Wonderful service. The maid kept our room absolutely spotless.The chefs really knew their craft. I never had a meal I didn't enjoy. Desserts were especially good.Bartenders: I'm not a big rum drinker, but they made some incredible blended drinks. And if the bartenders and barmaids don't put a smile on your face, there is something wrong with you.All this may sound too good to be true. Just so I don't sound like a hotel tout in disguise or a Pollyanna, here's a couple things I didn't like: that white sand beach I mentioned? It's nice to look at, but it's pretty sterile. I walked for miles in both directions and didn't see a single seashell. Also, very few fish right off the beach. If snorkelling and seeing lots of marine life right outside your door is important, Punta Cana is not the place for you.As I said, the food was great, but with the exception of Dominican night, there wasn't much local food on offer. Too bad, because Dominican food has a great reputation. I thought the sancocho and mangu were great when they were offered, but I'd have liked them to be availabe more often.Other guests: Princess is Spanish owned, so expect a lot of Europeans. Most were well-behaved and didn't exhibit the rude, boorish behavior for which they're so well-known, but there are always a few. Be prepared for Russians who do nothing but scream into their cellphones all day. I can't believe they are so important that they can't forget about business for a few hours.In line to make a resevation for the a la cartes, expect to see a few Euros walk to the front of the line under the pretense of asking a question about the cuisine, and trying to sneak in a reservation. The ones who tried this were directed to the back of the line.I saw one Euro (no need to be specific on his nationality-let's just refer to him as Jacques) unzip his pants, whip it out and get ready to whizz against a wall in one of the bars. Only a maitre'd opening the restaurant door stopped him.

<Content>Beautiful resort, but numerous problems My boyfriend and I just returned on Wednesday, January 25, 2006. I have spent most of my time in the bathroom. I have had severe diarrhea and constant cramping. There is no doubt that it was the food. I started having problems the first day at the resort. I am not a picky eater, but all the buffet food was cold. Eggs, rice, meat, etc were all room temperature or cold. The last night of our visit I had the worst lobster tail. I only ate half of it and I assure you I never leave a bite of lobster. I didn't have a clue as to what most of the food was, but I thought it was terrible.Our room was very nice, but we had no hot water at all and the water pressure was barely enough to use the shower. My boyfriend had to work on the toilet, as it quit working several times.Some of the staff were very nice and yet a few were just plain rude/nasty.Would I return? No. The grounds were beautiful, but I have been home 5 days and I am not yet recovered. Not worth it.

<Content>Beautiful Beach But Not A 5 Star I stayed at the Bavaro Princess with 7 family members from December 30, 2005 till January 6, 2006. I must start by praising the positive. Beautiful beach and ocean (made the whole trip). Resort grounds were pretty and they had two great pools as well as a swim up bar. We enjoyed the nightly entertainment.On the negative side the accomodations were not impressive. We had booked suites which were in a main building right near the main entrance to the resort. We were a 10-15 minute walk to the beach and the rooms were shabby/tired looking and very damp. The bathroom sink was leaking on the floor all week. If you book with the Bavaro Princess I would advise you try and get one of the cottages close to the beach (newer and nicer). The trains they have shuttling people to the beach (maybe 2-3 total) were not sufficient for the size of the resort and the amount of ground you have to cover (we were there over the Christmas holidays and the resort was at full capacity).Service was hit and miss. I brought American money and Dominican Pesos. I tipped the maid 2-4 dollars American everyday and there were no extra touches. Fridge in our room had a temperature control problem so bottles of pop kept blowing up and leaking all over the floor. At the bars again I kept the American tips flowing and generally discovered that for some staff this was the motivation you needed to get served but yet for others they would stand around talking to other staff and basically wait on you when they felt good and ready. Having worked as both a waitress and bartender for many years I felt this was not very good service (no consistency but I have heard this is the Dominican way). I did meet many nice friendly staff but there are just as many who are obviously not happen about their job. As a friendly, easy going Canadian we do not make a big stink about bad service so there was no reason for some of the attitude we ran into. I do have to say one of the nicest staff members I met was the lady who mopped the ladies washroom every night. She always had a smile on her face and I felt here is one person who works hard doing a job most people would not want to have, people are not throwing money at her and yet she is always happy. A couple of nights before I left I gave her $5.00 American and thanked her for the job she does.Service at the restaurants was mediocre to horrid. At the Italian restaurant they were running behind with serving people and approaching the time of the next seating. Our group of 7 was patiently waiting for our dessert and coffee. There was no sign of waiter so we finally asked if we could speak to our waiter. The head waiter/manager came up and asked us What did we want and when we inquired about our dessert and coffee he proceeded to tell us that they had none of the desserts left that all 7 of us had ordered (it had been okay when we ordered) and he very rudely offered us one other choice and made it very apparent he just wanted us to leave as they were trying to clear out the restaurant for the next seating. We told them to forget about dessert and coffee and got up and left feeling not very good about how we had been treated. Again this is no 5 star. Last Christmas the 4 star I stayed at in the Mayan Riviera had great service and alot better food. Half way through the week I figured out food wise I was safest with fresh fruit, bread, waffles, omlettes (main buffet), pasta (takes getting used to as they use alot of oil cooking) or burgers and fries. We tried the Asian, Italian and Argentinian restaurants and had reservations for the Seafood restaurant but did not go because by that point so many of our party were so sick they could not go or did not have an appetite.This brings me to my biggest problem with this place which we only discovered when we returned home. During our week stay 5 out 7 people felt sick to some degree during the week. For most of us it was serious stomach cramps and loose stools (NO we did not drink the water not even for brushing our teeth); however for 3 people in our party it actually kept them pretty much in their rooms for 2 days with vomitting, fever and diarreah (not pleasant to talk about but reality). One of our group (10 year old) was still so sick the weekend we got home that he had to be taken to the hospital and has since been diagnosed with Salmonella Poisoning. This of course got our local health department involved and they advised the other 6 of us be tested. Much to my suprise I just found out today that I have also tested positive for Salmonella. I had falsely assumed that because I did not have the gastriointestinal symptoms anymore and only was feeling nausea (figured it was the Malaria pills I have been taking for six weeks) that I did not have it. So now 2 out of 7 have Salmonella and we are still waiting for one more persons test results to come back. Salmonella is easily treated with antibiotics, but this is not what I expect to come back with from a 5 star resort. We paid premium dollar to go to this place at Christmas and because it was a 5 star. I feel the trip was disappointing relative to the value we perceived/expected based on what we paid for this vacation (makes me sick when I think what we paid for this). I may have had a different opinion if I had booked a great last minute deal.Lastly the tour operator, Sunwing is not one I would recommend based on the flights. Two weeks before our trip our direct flight from Ottawa to Punta Cana got cancelled and we were suddenly leaving much earlier because now we were flying Ottawa to Cancun and then Cancun to Dominican (9 1/2 hours with children). Needless to say we never would have booked this flight if that had been the original arrangement. Then coming back we left the resort at night for a flight that was supposed to leave around 11:30 (had been earleir but had already been changed 2 weeks before we left). We get to the airport to find out our flight is delayed and we now are not leaving until 3:30 AM. So here we are with children sleeping on benches in the airport. We finally arrived in Ottawa at 7:30 AM (9 1/2 hours after we had left the resort for the airport). This trip to Punta Cana has been my only experience with Sunwing but I have since learned that they seem to have alot of these crazy long flights. I am going to either Cuba or the Mayan Riviera next month and have made a point of telling my travel partner that I am not crazy about travelling with Sunwing again and have already vetoed a nice resort in Cuba because it was with Sunwing and we were going to have to fly Ottawa to Cancun and then Cancun to Cuba.I know this review sounds terrible, but it was the reality of the trip. We did have fun despite these issues and the beach and ocean were so amazing that I might someday go back to Punta Cana (a different resort) just for more of their beaches. We litterly stayed on the beach and played in the ocean all week and made the most of the positive points of this resort.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel I was transferred to this hotel after the hotel I was supposed to stay at was overbooked. When the group i was was with came over to check in we were taken right away ,they knew we were coming welcomed us with drinks, took care of us immediately and had our rooms ready. The hotel itself is beautiful. The people on the most part were very friendly and accomodating. The rooms were very clean, spacious, and the air conditioners worked wonderfully. I was very impressed with my entire stay. The beach is beautiful and very clean. The food was good, just needed a little variety. The hotel is huge I would actually need a full week to be able to use all of the ammenities offered by the hotel.. I was very happy with my stay and wish i was able to stay longer

<Content>A true carribean oasis We just came back from a two week stay at the Bavaro Princess and it was AMAZING !!!Our suite was beautiful, it was clean, spacious and the extra bed we asked for was waiting for us when we arrived just like we asked our travel agent.The food was pretty good. I did not enjoy having to book our a la carte reservations so early in the morning so my husband and I took turns waking up early. It was a good excuse to have a good morning run and then continue exercising at the gym which was close to the lobby. Next time we return we will have platinum status so we will not have to worry about booking our reservations by waiting in line at the lobby. It was worth it to go to the restaurants even though the food at the buffet was pretty good. We loved Sakura and El Gaucho.The beach was a dream. The white sand, palm trees and blue water blew us away. It was so relaxing to have breakfast by the beach every morning and then take long walks along the beach. The grounds were very well kept and they were well lit at night. It is a large resort and it could take 10 minutes to walk from one end of it to the other. But walking never hurt us and we enjoyed the walk back to our room if the train was full. We would take different routes each time and discover new sights each time. There is a conservation area in the middle of the resort filled with beautiful plants and Iguanas and birds, etc. I would not say that we ever had to wait more than 5 minutes for the train if we decided not to walk. The entertainment was excellent. By the end of the two weeks we knew all the entertainers by their first names and they knew us by our first names, it was like we made new friends. The daily activities were a lot of fun and there was always something to do. My daughter loved the kids club and she was there every day from 10 to 5 pm. Then she had entertainment at 8 or 8:30 pm. She even participated in the lion king and snow white shows. She loved the costumes and the makeup, and being on stage. The water sports were so much fun. We used the catamaran on a few occasions, we went snorkeling, cayaking, banana boating, parasailing. This resort had it all!!We met a few families from Canada and the US and we are keeping in touch since our trip. We are planning to all return together next christmas.Near the end of our trip we met a couple that was a member of the royal holiday club and we decided to join as well, so we are definetely going back to the Bavaro Princess.I would refrain from believing the bad reviews. There are people who just do not know how to look at the positive and only look at the negatives. I would definetely recommend this resort and I will come back as soon as I can take time off of work.

<Content>dissapointed The hotel is in a horrible shape, very shabby, the grounds are full of dirt, poddles after the rain are standing for days,not beeng cleaned, when you passing some places on the way to the lobby the standing water stinks, like you are in the sewer.In the main buffet you can hardly find somebody who speaks English, the food is very bad, there is no variety. All in all once a great hotel,it is horrible now and is not worth the money they charge.

<Content>Nightmare! A group of 34 of my friends went to the Bavaro Princess for our friends wedding. We orIginally were booked at the Punta Cana Princess but were switched to the Bavero two weeks before because of renovations. We walked over to the hotel we were suppose to be at and we couldn't find a nail or a hammer anywhere THERE WERE NO RENOVATIONS. So basically they were trying to move us all into one resort so that they didn't have to have both open but didn't want to close the other one so that people would still book with Princess.I will touch on three the following issues 1.DRUGS IN MY DRINK;2.ALL RESTAURANTS CLOSED (except main buffet);3.ROOMS NOT READY;4. LUGGAGE DIDN鈥橳 SHOW UP;5. NOT ENOUGH TRAINS FOR THE BIG RESORT TO TAKE YOU FROM LOBBY,YOUR ROOM OR POOL  BEACH;6.STAFF WEDDING DAY WEARING JEANS;7.NO MAKING RESERVATIONS;8.LIGHTS OUT BY 11:30 ON RESORT (CAN鈥橳 FIND YOU WAY AROUND)9.SEPTIC SMELLS SO BADSo when we got the Bavaro Princess at 1:30 pm all of our rooms were not ready.. including the bride and groom鈥檚. We had to wait until 3:30 until we got them.. some of us still didn't get them to after 4:30. We then had to wait for our bags from there bell boys until 5:30 pm. that was awful service. The rooms were really nice BUT our phone didn't work and I asked everyday for a new phone but no one came to bring one... despite all my complaints. I even went to the front desk and they told me that 鈥渕aybe鈥?they would be able to send someone to look at it. They even recommended that I go back to my room with one of their off duty staff to look at it with him. I am a 25 year old woman and there is no way I would feel safe going back to my room with a man I don鈥檛 even know that isn鈥檛 wearing a staff uniform or a name tag to look at my broken phone. Still no phone even on our last day when they said they would fix it and give us a wake up call so we wouldn鈥檛 miss our flight.The resort is huge so walking from the lobby to the beach or even to your rooms is at least 15 minutes鈥?and the septic smell in one section is soooo strong that it is enough to make you gag. They also turn the lights out before 11:30 at night so the entire resort is dark and you can鈥檛 find you way along the dark paths or even see room numbers of all the villa鈥檚. My friends mom was walking alone from the buffet at night and they shut down the lights and she came back to the buffet really worked up, upset and scared. Even though there are guards with guns on the beach infront of the resort it doesn鈥檛 really make it feel any safer when it is completely dark. The trolleys that drive you around don鈥檛 run late and even if they are running (before midnight) they drive past you and are often full of people. They only had one running so you had to wait over 25 mins for one to come by you and it would be full and wouldn鈥檛 stop. It happened to rain everyday we were there so we often stood in the rain waiting.All the restaurants were closed and they just had the buffet open. Sometimes you had to wait in line to even get in. If you called to make a reservation for one of the promised restaurants they would say they are booked and then when you would go to them they were empty. They were suppose to be available but they weren鈥檛 and they moved the special restaurants into the main buffet so they didn鈥檛 have to have the other buildings open.For my friends wedding the staff was disorganized and not very accommodating.. they kept moving the location on us.My one friend鈥檚 dad went to complain to the manager and they said they would try to up the service a bit鈥? But didn鈥檛. When we wrote the resort a letter they said there were no complaints.. that was a lie.. we all complained.We booked a day trip through the resort to go snorkeling.. the bus didn鈥檛 show. We booked another day trip to go fishing and they messed up the days and switched it to the day of the wedding when no one could go.We were suppose to stay at the Tropical Princess down the beach but two weeks before they switched us to this hotel due to renovations.. we went to see it and there were no renovations.. just a slow time of year and they didn鈥檛 want both of their hotels running鈥?complete nightmare.Basically the only good thing about this trip was the friends that we brought.

<Content>Simply Paradise I just returned from our trip booked through apple and we had a wonderful stay at the bavaro princess resort. The flight was out of BWI in Baltimore and it went very smooth. We arrived at 10:30am and our two rooms were not ready, so we checked in and headed to the beach and also grabbed some lunch there. At 3pm we checked into one room and the other was not ready. This is the only problem we encountered. The second room was not ready because of an extended check-out time. At 7pm I went back to the desk and they apologized for the wait and gave my husband and I an ocean front room for the inconvinence. WOW! what a view!The weather was 80 and mostly to completely sunny everyday. I was worried because the forecast before we left was a chance of thunderstorms everyday. It did rain at night one or two times and one 5 minute tropical shower one early morning. There was a great variety of food, some new tastes and some food that taste like what I'm use to. I had two picky teenage eaters with me and they always found something to eat. There were chefs who made fresh omelets,waffles, and pasta. The milk taste different but not bad in my tea. You do need to get up to the lobby to book your dinner reservation by 8 or 8:30am everyday. You can book that day and the following day dinner times. We tried all the resturants except licey (we did not upgrade to platinum and did not feel like we missed anything). We enjoyed all the dinners. We did tip when service was good which was almost all the time. The staff works so hard, they deserve tips. We went on the snorkeling trip and had a great time. We stopped at several other hotels to pick up people and I must say I am glad we stayed where we did. Our resort grounds were so much prettier and well kept then the others I saw. The beach was beautiful and the water was so warm. We caught some of the resort shows and they were very entertaining. Our rooms were kept extremely clean and they have coke products, beer, and water in frig. If you like mm's, potato chips etc... take your own if you can. They have these products if you run out, but it will cost you. Chips were $5.50 US and choc. was also costly, but you can get it in case of an emergency snack attack. There are shops in the lobby and across the street from the resort. The vendors from across the street came to the lobby plaza one evening of our stay. I would love to return to this resort, it had everything I expected and more. Ignore the bad reports, however some problems can occur. If this happens treat the staff with respect and friendliness and they will work with you to resolve the problems.

<Content>Excellent Resort We Had a wonderful time at this resort! It was very clean and tidy! The best I have ever had a resort and I have stayed at many a place in the Carribean. The service was pretty good, most of the people very very friendly, but there were a few that I'm not sure they were overly happy about being there! The flight with Air Canada was good as we flew first class. No line ups better food etc. They did manage to lose our luggage for an hour in Toronto though. no worries though..  The food was excellent in most of the restaurants. Could always find something good to eat! The beach was awesome, fine powdery sand and the water was blue. The only thing was there was no good snorkeling off the beach. the water was to rough for the time we were there. It was fun to body surf the waves though!!! The rooms were excellent . they were comfortable with good air conditioning and comfortable beds. The maid did a great job of keeping it clean. No mold or dirt anywhere!!!! Overall I would say this is a truly 5 star resort!!!!!!!!!! I would recommend this place to anyone...

<Content>here is the real deal! I stayed with my family (12 people) from January 1st 2006 to January 8th 2006. I will give you a breif overveiw of my experiences...first when we arrived at the hotel at around 3pm our rooms weren't ready and were told that in 20minutes they would be ready, to make a long story short me and my boyfriend were without a room until about 10:30 pm (were lucky that we went with such a large group so we could put our lugage somewhere). but to be fair that was the only major problem we had the whole week.the only other problem we had was the food. yes it was tasty but every meal i had at this hotel except for the a la carte restaurants were COLD. this made meals not so apatising. but other than these two factors the holiday was amazing, the beach is gorgeous, the grounds are stunning yes the place is big but not so big that you would need to take the train everywhere. i have been to a couple other carribean countries before and the dominican seems to be the only one that has a language bariar. sometimes it's difficult to communicate with the staff because we didn't know spanish and they couldn't understand english, but this was only a very minor problem.all in all the resort grounds and rooms are 5 starsthe food is 4 starand the service is 3 starsother than the things i have mentioned my trip was one i will definately rememeber and cherish.

<Content>WOW - GET THE PLATINUM PACKAGE My husband and I just got back yesterday. I had to write about this magnificant place. We got the platinum package and we tipped, which is the big difference between the other negative comments made by previous travelers. We never stood in line, our room was spotless, our bar was stocked, the towels were always there and the service was that of a queen not a princess. We cannot wait to go back in June!!!

<Content>Not 5 star but close After just spending a week at the Bavaro Princess I felt compelled to write a short summary of our experiences there. Everything went like clock work from the airport -check in was a breeze and getting to our room was made extremely easy. We did have a slight delay in getting our luggage to our room but no big deal. The resort is extremely large so be prepared to do some walking or wait and ride the trains to get around, we usually walked for the exercise anyways. The rooms are not as impressive as some that we have stayed in but they are adequate for our needs, as we spent very little time there anyways as we were always on the go the entire week. The food was excellent at nearly every resturant and the large buffet had enough variety to please anyone with a remotely good attitude about life. I mention attitude simply because I truly believe that people that write these negative reviews must have attitudes that would compel one to avoid them if possible. Look for good and you will find good, look for bad and that too can be found. We took one side trip during the week-the Outback Safari-this is a must for all guests if they want to see the interior of the Dominican Republic, had an outstanding day with this trip. The Casino right outside the resort is very nice even though it is quite small by our standards, however it was never crowded so that we couldn't enjoy ourselves. The shows at the resort in the evenings might not measure up to some but they were entertaining nonetheless.The check out procedure was effortless and our return to the US was smooth. All in all a great vacation with little to no problems, fabulous weather and a great beach to enjoy.

<Content>Perfect Honeymoon Resort I couldn't have dreamed up a better place for our honeymoon! The VIP package was the best choice with dinner at Licey (exquisite!), special honeymoon gifts and premium drinks. The VIP concierge service was impeccable and made us feel like royalty every moment of our stay. The restaurants were all divine and the resort itself was too beautiful for words. The weather was perfect every single day but for a 10 minute light shower on our 4th afternoon. The staff were friendly, courteous and exceedingly gracious. It seems like it was only a dream until I look at all the photos we took and remember the languid perfection of each day and evening we spent there. We will definitely go again, and again and again...

<Content>Outstanding Resort We found the landscaping to be absolutely superb! The paths to the beach and restaurants were beautiful and perfect for nightly strolls. We loved the fact that the resort is on such a large piece of land as it feels roomy and gives way to privacy.The food was alright. It was not amazing, but nothing wrong with it either.The staff is very friendly and does a great job in keeping everything very clean.We will definately want to visit this resort again!

<Content>5 Stars and here's why I stayed at the Princess from December 31st, 2005 - January 7th, 2006 with my wife and my two kids (8 years old and 5 years old) and IT WAS GREAT. First of all, while reading this, please remember that I have travelled 16 times somewhere in the Caribbean and the Princess is definitely a 5 star resort...here's why:Check-in took less than 5 minutes and we were personally driven to our room (847). The room is the cleanest I have ever seen down south. It was incredible, but we learned soon after that our room was repainted and re-wall-to-wall-furniturized, including the mattresses. It was like being in a brand new room. We NEVER ran out of hot water, even when we took 4 successive showers (for a total of 30 minutes!). The water pressure was not like here, but very HIGH for Caribbean standards. The temperature was always steady, none of this hot-cold water spouting. The cable TV was clear, no snow whatsoever and about half the channels are in english. The fridge was always completely stocked and was COLD. The water even froze one night, so we had to lower the thermostat just a little bit. The air conditioning was simply too cold, so again we had to lower the thermostat. We were on the last floor (which is the second floor) so we did not see any critters nor bugs at all. We were 4 in the room and at no point did we feel overloaded. The rooms are HUGE for Caribbean standards. The word SUITES lives up to its name. The above paragraph should be enough to convince you that this IS A 5-STAR resort. But that's not all!!!The beach is amazing. 7 days of fine white-pinkish sand. 7 days without seeing ANY jellyfish, starfish, fish. In 7 days, if I would have picked up ALL the seaweed at night, I don't think I would have filled up a big green garbage bag. By the way, according to the manager, there was more than 1400 people at the resort and we never had to play the famous Caribbean chair game. There was ALWAYS some chairs available. If you absolutely need a palapa, there are always some available too, but not the ones closest to the beach. There are 4 rows of those. There are so many chairs, that we had the luxury of having a palapa and 4 chairs AND 4 more chairs for wading in the sea. There are 2 security guards on duty at all times and there are people passing around picking up our garbage every hour. The beach is one of the cleanest in the world I have ever seen. The beach is most definitely up to 5-STAR standards.The pool is amazing. Again, plenty of chairs, two bars including a huge one in the pool. There are at least 12 showers surrounding the pool and there is an infinite supply of clean towels. You can change your dirty towels as often as you wish. There is a lot of sand in the pool near closing time, but as the pool opens the next day, you wouldn't believe it. The water is SO clear the the pool is SO clean, it is up to 5-star standards.The grounds are amazing. No matter where you are on these grounds, if you look up, there is always someone working. Whether it's raking, mowing, weeding, bordering, feeding the birds, cutting open some coconuts, etc, the place is the cleanest I have ever seen. They even mop the paleo walkways when it doesn't rain. This means you can walk barefoot throughout the grounds with no fear of ever stepping on anything dangerous, not even a pebble. The bird sanctuary is beautiful and my kids wanted to walk through it every day. The comments you read on previous reviews about the smell is correct. STAY AWAY FROM BLOCKS 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25. They border the septic system and the bird sanctuary which gives off a permanent odour that one does not wish to consistently have. As for an ocean view, forget it, only 4 buildings out of 65 can offer it and they are buildings 1,2,73,74. A lot of reviewers talk madly about buildings in the forties and fifties, but to me, they are not so great. OK, they are close to the hotel's main lobby where you will have to go every day (I'll explain that later)but they are far from the beach. So, if you are going for the beach, take buildings 1-8,63-67,70-77,80-87. If you want to be close to the action (ie lobby, shows, gym, discotheque, casino) then take 40's and 50's. In the middle are 20's  30's, but whatever you do, because of the odour, don't take the low 20's. We were in block 84 (There are 8 rooms per block, so 841,842,843 and so on). Block 84 is a 1 minute 50 second walk to the beach and a 10 minute walk to the lobby. But there are shuttles that pass every 5 minutes. The sad thing is that a trolley holds a maximum of 18 adults, so it is often full when it gets to the scheduled stops. So the way to ensure a place is to board the shuttle a block or two before a scheduled stop, because it stops at any moment when you flag it down. So by boarding before a scheduled stop, there is always room. But then again, from one end of the grounds to the other is a 12 minute walk. I have scanned the map of the grounds. EMAIL me if you want me to send you a copy of the map. Just the beauty of the grounds makes this a 5 star resort.The restaurants are amazing. Hispaniola is the ONLY place where a gentleman can eat with bermuda shorts on. ALL OTHER PLACES, we need long pants. I tried all 7 restaurants and they were all great. If one does not find anything that is to their liking, it's because they are picky eaters. We ate everything from Filet mignon, to shrimp, lobster, sushi, hamburgers, salads, sandwiches, etc. My favourite was Sakura for the sushi and chinese food. The restaurants are definitely 5 star standards. The only negative part here is that the service is TOO FAST. We always ate early because of the kids so the rushed our service to free the table. But sometimes, with kids, this is not such a bad thing. Other note, if you are not VIP, the Licey is not worth the extra 25$ US per person, not because of the french cuisine at the Licey, but because the food at the other restaurants is just too darn good to warrant at 25$ US surcharge. Of course though, Licey is included if you are VIP.As for VIP, we did not take it, because of the kids. We were not going to drink much, so the brand name booze was not necessay to us. Then, VIP gives you internet access, but my kids paid 3$ US for 30 minutes which was plenty and finally, we paid 20$ each for a message on the beach. So unless you are going to get plastered each day, the 150$ US price each for VIP status is not worth it. If the hotel is not full, you may get an oceanfront room with VIP status, but because the hotel was full when we went, those rooms were already given to VIP's and even Platinum Super VIP's (who get a lounge of their own).Service was exceptionnal everywhere I went, simply because I tipped the same 2 waiters 2$ per day each. Then, they see you in a crowd, pick you out first and serve you. So for 28$, you get the royal service. As for the maids, we gave them 3$ per day and some clothes and candy for their kids and in return, they brought sparkling wine and fresh cut flowers every day. There is always a gallon of fresh bottled water in your fridge. Definitely 5-star standards.The only nightlife I can talk about are the evening shows. We went every night, starting at 8:30 and the kids LOVED it. Whatever you do, don't miss the Lion King...great costumes, make-up and choreographies.Funtastic zone and Kids-Club were great because we would lose our kids for up to 2 hours. They enjoyed the iguanas, monkies, birds, games, mini-golf, etc.Finally, the true reason why this is a 5-star resort is that all coffee, juice AND ICE is made with bottled water. This is repeated over and over by staff and we can see the juice and coffee machines rigged up to 5 gallon water bottles. The proof is that this was the first and only time that any member of my family has never gotten anything resembling a stomach ache!!! NOW THAT IS 5-STAR QUALITY.Of course, a review is not a review without negative aspects. The geese bite, so watch it. You must go to the lobby EVERY DAY to reserve your table at one of the restaurants. And if you want a good time slot in the restaurant of your choice, you MUST go at 8 am when the reservation desk opens because spaces are VERY limited. There is always Hipaniola where it is buffet with no reservations and no long pants. And finally, the wine is NO GOOD. We were told this, so we remedied this by bringing our own wine (from our local LCBO here in Ottawa)for each supper. We drink their house wine at lunch, but for supper, we brought our own bottle which they gladly opened and served for us. I have over 100 pictures and a map, feel free to email me for information at rbrazeau@ireseau.com

<Content>WORST NIGHTMARE OF MY LIFE I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from dec 29th to jan 6. Upon check in I was expecting the king size bed that i booked and couldnt wait to enjoy... Unfortunatley when i got to my room i saw 4 single beds, the tv was broken and outside my room was a big lake of sewage due to a broken pipe. I called to complain and was told that someone would get back to me..... no one did.... so the next morning with my back ache because one of the four single beds i shared with my girlfriend was sinking i went to get another room i waited 3 hours for the staff to find me another room. The second room was bigger but mediocre at best. Next food -- bring your own!!! You need reservations for all the restaraunts!!! and guess what they only book 25percent of capacity at each restaurant. I was curious why there was seating for 150 people and everytime i ate dinner that only about 20-25 people were dining there. Well i asked one of the waiters and he told me that the hotel has a qouto on food. so they can only make 50 steaks at the gaucho, only one wonton in the wonton soup at sakura, and no more than 2 shrimps in the seafood pasta dish at bella pasta... What a shame.... I was rationed food at at 5 star hotel The staff is nice but they are under strict orders not to give any extra food away... Oh the best part to even eat at any of the restaurants you have to wake up at 9 am and take the bus trolley all the way to the lobby to get reserevations..... guess what when you get there most of the restaurants are taken already you have to do this everyday..... if not you will be stuck eating at the buffet yuk!!! I will never come back to this resort.

<Content>"Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder"! We booked this 10 day vacation (the very 1st time--going to the Dominican Republic), through ROYAL-HOLIDAY Vacations, last January. Our flight, was booked  billed--separately. At first..., I was quite DISMAYED to have read all of the Negative connotations abut this Restort. As the year progressed however, the Comments GOT BETTER  BETTER! (Was this due to ANY changes that the Bavaro Princess had made?) We travel each year: 2X's Nationally in the U.S., and also 2X's Internationally. Although this was our very first All-Inclusive, we found this quite ENJOYABLE, and the quality  assortment of foods at the Bavaro Princess --were Excellent! Virtually ALL of the Staff that we came in contact with--were very polite. The Jr. Suites (I believe), are all the same, with a very large Living Room  Kitchenette/ a raised-bedroom/, and a bathroom area for applying your make-up, etc., along with a tub/shower, and 2 toilets (has a bidette'). EVERYONE AGREES [as they ALL should!], that the Beach area  the pools, are EXCEPTIONAL!! We did some shopping, just outside of the Resort, and were simply, led into their shops. The BEST SHOPPING, is all the way (North) of the Beach, (Where the Shipwreck is), in a series of attached buildings, called a Farmers Market. There--you'll find (DEALS, in which you can Barter for!), on: cigarettes, booze, T-shirts, jewelry, coffee, ETC. ENJOY your stay, just as much as we did, and have (as many) drinks, as you'd like, at their Restaurants  bar areas! We paid the $10. Entry fee into Dominican Republic (and it was stapled into our Passports), AND was charged by our United Airlines Ticketing Agent, and ADDITIONAL #20./per person--to leave the Island. IS THIS TRUE...?! Did anyone who has travelled to the Dominican Republic, have to pay this additonal fee, upon leaving the Island??!

<Content>Beautiful Resort, Wonderful Staff My mom, husband and I spent seven beautiful days at the Bavaro Princess from December 21-28, 2005.I will echo the initial reservations that many posters have voiced upon reading some of the reviews here鈥攂ut we didn鈥檛 encounter anything that made the trip horrible and, probably in the ultimate vote of confidence, we are considering taking another trip to the Bavaro Princess in the next year or so with friends.Broken-down for easy reading, here is my review of the resort and its staff during our stay. As background, we booked through Apple Vacations, had a direct flight from Detroit to Punta Cana via USA 3000 and did not go Platinum. As for familiarity with the language, I took a year and a half of Spanish in college about 8 years ago. Nothing since, except for a quick brush up in the week prior to the trip.Airport Arrival: Went very smooth. Yes, there was a little wait to get through immigration (approx. 20 minutes), but our bags were unloaded and ready for pick up as soon as we got through, so really quite painless. The $10 鈥渆ntrance fee鈥?and ticket were easy enough to handle and the immigration officer made things very easy by stapling our tickets in our passport. No worry of loosing it and paying later.Shuttle to Hotel: Since we were Apple, a representative was waiting for us just as we exited the airport. We just walked to our bus, had our bags loaded and were off to the hotel within 15 minutes. The actual ride took about 45 minutes because we had to drop off people at 3-4 hotels before the Princess.Hotel Check-in/Check-out: We were greeted by bellmen as soon as we exited the bus. As our bags were unloaded, we were informed that non-Platinum had to check in on the right side of the lobby, Platinum on the left (two women on the bus were not listening to this, went to the non-Platinum side, waited in line, only to be told they needed to go to the other side since the agent did not have access to their reservation because they were Platinum- totally not hotel staff鈥檚 fault). We left our bags at the luggage holding area and waited maybe two minutes for the next available agent. In the meantime, we were served a beverage by a member of the staff- very nice touch.Check-in took about five minutes for both my mom and my husband and I (two suites). Our agent spoke a little more English than my mom鈥檚 agent, but even she got the gist. Our rooms were not ready, so we gave room number tags to the bell person. He gave a us a key to a room nearby, so we could change. The room was decent, though you had to take the tank cover off of the toilet to flush it. No biggie. It鈥檚 not like they were expecting us to stay the night there or anything. In fact, I viewed it as a big perk to not have to change in a women鈥檚 bathroom stall or something.We ate a quick lunch at Hispaniola and then headed to the beach. On our way there, we passed our rooms (075 and 091), and the maid was finishing up. So, we asked in a mix of English and Spanish if we could leave our carry-ons- no a problem.We hung out at the beach for an hour or so and then checked into our rooms. Again, took maybe two minutes to get the keys and get the bellmen to deliver our luggage.Check-out was even simpler- just turn in all of your keys and fill out a survey.Rooms: Our rooms were lovely- about 2 minutes from the beach and 1 minute from the pool. I noticed a very slight damp odor on the sheets, but I have had far worse in other tropical locale. I just take it as a given somewhere warm and humid. The d茅cor fit the location- almost Pier One like. We did not have a TV remote (my mom did), but we weren鈥檛 there to watch tons of TV, so no big deal. You could see the TV from one half of the bed, so that wasn鈥檛 an issue for us. Plenty of drawer space (no need for extra hangers, though I brought them). Stocked fridge (a couple of tips ($15 total for the whole week) to the maid and written requests in Spanish kept the beer and Coca Light levels high). Only once did I have low water pressure/no hot water during the whole week (two showers a day). My husband never did, nor did my mom. Beds harder than a prefer, but I slept well enough.Beach: What can I say that people haven鈥檛 already said. It is perfect- palm trees and all. Yes, the waves can be a little large at times, but having grown up on Lake Michigan, it is no worse that what you can experience there. And I don鈥檛 know a single responsible parent that is comfortable letting children under the age of 10 (or not a strong swimmer) go wild in the water without supervision, so it really shouldn鈥檛 be an issue. But just in case, there are security guards posted through the beach, just in case a real problem arises.Food: It was fine. Nothing spectacular, though the Christmas Eve buffet was a sight to see- huge shrimp toward and lobster halves for all. Again, I agree with others- the food here is not to the same level as a four-star US restaurant. But no resort that I have ever been to in the Caribbean (and I have been to seven) has been up to that level. If you want warm weather and good food, pay the premium and head to Anguilla, which is known for its amazing restaurants. Otherwise eat your pasta, rice  beans, salad, hot dog鈥攐r any number of items offered by the resort鈥攁nd be quiet. It鈥檚 not like you are going to starve or even have to put up with eating something remotely awful.Just to further elaborate on where we ate: Hispaniola (night 1), Chopin (nights 2, 4, 6- we liked that it was less crowded and had a beautiful backdrop with the water and trees), El Pescador (night 3), Sakura (nights 5, 7). All were good, but I liked Chopin and Sakura the best because of their atmosphere. Also, no stomach problems on my end or my mom. My husband had a little something, but I think it was more likely too much salt water from snorkeling rather than food, since I tasted everything he had.Staff: The staff was, nine times out of ten, wonderful. Yes, we did occasionally tip the services staff (no more than $1 at a time), and, yes, we did notice a difference in the level of service. After the second time, my husband could walk up to the beach bar and, even with six people ahead of him, the bartender would immediately make his drink order (without even being told- perhaps we are too predicable). Fair, maybe not entirely. But considering how little it cost us ($25 throughout the whole week) and how much it obviously meant to them, oh well.Excursions: My mom and I did leave the resort one morning in search of cigars, liquor, coffee, etc. Again, even though I have been to several islands, these vendors were the pushiest. But simply treating them like people (say 鈥渉ola鈥? 鈥渘o gracias鈥?, and we were fine. Just keep walking. We also went snorkeling with sharks and rays via the Marinarium. I was rather disappointed because it was just too crowded. People that had never snorkeled before went with the advanced group because it 45 minutes, not a half hour. But they had no clue of snorkel etiquette. Really awful. But the staff was great, and did everything they could to get you to have a fun time.Final Thoughts: One thing I noticed over and over again were people complaining about the speed and attitude of the staff. Yet, these same people couldn鈥檛 be bothered to learn the simplest phrases in Spanish鈥攐r even buy a small Spanish dictionary in the extreme case that you need to communicate you need a moment to dress (鈥淯n momento, por favor鈥?would certainly do the trick). If you take even the smallest effort to reach out the staff in their own language, you will be amazed at how hard they will work to make your stay amazing.I know our stay was.

<Content>Go with an open mind and you will have a fantastic time This review is a little late, but I couldn't resist writing it after reading the last review.Eleven of us, ranging in ages from 14 - 70, enjoyed two great weeks here in March '04. So much so, that we are all returning for the same in 2006, only going Platinum this time.Yes, you will find things different in the Caribbean than North America, but isn't that what most of us go for? Superb weather, beautiful white beach, Dominicans that treat you as you treat them - a Hola, a smile or a tip for the young waiter who works so hard for the lunch crowd or the fellows that constantly raked the beach and (if you took the time to ask them their name and about their family), remembered your name the rest of your holiday.The food is different from what we are used to - Caesar salads are not like anything we have had before, but order a green salad instead. Most meals we really enjoyed. Dominican night in the Hispanola was not a favorite, but we found fried chicken, french fries and green beans, so didn't go hungry. The pasta station was always excellent with a good choice of ingredients.We did have tiny little ants in our room the first day, but were prepared from reading previous reviews and spread pennies around. Don't know if it was a result of that or not, but not an ant was seen after.If you are having a cup of coffee in the room, take a minute to rinse the cup out before setting it down - no bugs! The same if you are having room service, whether putting the dishes outside or leaving them in the room. Warm climates have unexpected critters, that is a given.Towels and bathing suits don't dry well with the high humidity. Taking an extra bathing suit along and exchanging your towel each day will alleviate that problem.We have holidayed in Florida and had a cockroach crossing our carpet and the odd lizard sharing our balcony. And, lots of those inch long bugs with a million feet, all in an expensive condo.If you are looking for a holiday where you are guaranteed great weather, fantastic beach, good food, lovely apartments, friendly natives who look you in the eye when greeting you AND you can accept the small things that maybe are not up to your standards, then this is the place for you! If not, try one of the beach areas in North America.

<Content>agree with previous comments myself and my partner have just returned from bavaro princess. i agree with most of the more positive comments shared on this forum. however, i just wanted to make a point. both myself and my partner had a similar perception to the previous writer. ie that the place is beautiful, food so-so, but that the guests leave a lot to be desired. the rudeness of some beggared belief. but our experience differed from the previous writer because in our opinion the rudeness was attributed to the 'north americans', because this was our experience. indeed, it made us not want to return to the carribean, and to return to indian ocean resorts instead. we are english, and were astounded at the queue jumping, (wait in line i think americans say!!) lack of consideration, i could write a book about the numerous incidents, however after reading comments hereon, it strikes me that perhaps the rudeness cannot be attributed to any particular nationality, but to a certain type of person, no matter their cultural background.  we all seem to have to accept that not everyone has the same standards, be they european or martian!! i just find it sad that if you wait at the bar, for example, the barman approaches, but knowing that someone was there before you, you refer the barman to that person, who doesnt even thank you, and then, someone else jumps in leaving you standing there like an idiot.  please understand, i do not set out to offend anyone, just to make the point that our perception was the same as the previous writers, and sadly it has made us not want to return. we could say the same about a certain type of brit abroad in many mediterranean resorts. it is individuals manners, not any particular nationality. i see that now, so sorry to any north american i may have been quietly seething about!!! happy travelling.

<Content>Food changes their attitudes dramaticly A quick review of my 2004 vacation. My family and I went here in June of 2004 and we had a wonderful time. we had gone on 3 cruises proir to this vacation and am sorry we did'nt do this sooner. We had a wonderful time but i have to agree with some other people that the food was not the best i've had but was no worse than the cruise lines (Carnival and Carribbean). The thing i found most interesting was when i gave maids,bartenders etc. tips they could have cared less. Well one day i went to the buffet and got a plate and brought it back to the bar the bartender looked at my meal as if it were gold. I asked him if he wanted a plate and he shyly said yes. I went to the buffet and loaded a plate for him and one other bartender and for the rest of my stay i was treated like a king. So for all of you people who feel you have to tip save youreself some money and get them a plate of food. Trust me it will be worth you're while. Maybe not the best place in Punta Canta but certainly the best value for you're buck.

<Content>Not my favorite place My family and I visited the Bavaro Princess from Dec. 17-24 and were very surprised with our results. Check in was an adventure, we went platinum and were driven around to the platinum desk where we were told that the two rooms we reserved were not in the same building. That was not feasible because we are travelng with our children and because no American family has more than two children (according to Apple Vacations)we had to book a room for them, this was put in the reservations, e-mailed before arrival so on. After much grief we were put in 2 beautiful rooms near the beach 776/778. We had no idea that you had to have an electric key to get anything in your room to work, we sat for 3hrs waiting on a key! Dinner at Hispanola is really your best bet, you can always eat cheeseburger, french fries, and salad. You never know what else you are eating, if you go to the restaurants book at 7pm so when you don't like the food you have enough time to get to the buffet. Joselo in El Gaucho is the worst staff member that you can encounter, he waited on us at dinner and would only give the 5 people at our table 1 menu! He then acted like we were taking to long to order. The resort in itself is really beautiful the beach makes up for everything else that is wrong!!!!! The rooms are damp to the point going to bed became gross, bring extra swimsuits because nothing around there ever dries. I could'nt have made it through the week without my trusty can of LYSOL, the bedspreads have a little mold around the edges, the maids DO NOT use any type of disinfectant when they clean, the beach tools that they leave in your room are damp also. I left a $5 tip everyday for the maid in the morning and evening. It makes no difference same service, slow and half-baked!!!! The bugs are a HUGE problem for me! I did'nt bring any bugs there and I did'nt want to take any home...with leads me to say I had a couple of ants crawling on our suitcases and I sprayed them with LYSOL and tried to over look that but after I had a cup of coffee and took a nap I went to put the empty cup outside and was surprised to find every and in the free world crawling on the table and in the cup! GROSS!!!I called the Platinum lounge and they sent someone to spray while we were gone to dinner, okay. When we got back from dinner there we 2 nice and dead cockroaches on the floor that were'nt there before. Time to move or go home, I asked if we could be moved and the manager swore there were no more rooms....after much fingerpointing and my demanding a refund he found 2 open rooms by surprise right on the beach!!!WOW...and guess what! Directly across from where we were staying. The new rooms were good, they are all the same just no bugs. Going with the Platinum package is not really worth the extra money because the people who did'nt have Platinum enjoyed the same (almost) amenities that we did, no big deal. The spa is beautiful, but after 2 visits I found it not to be sanitary. The towels they lay on the beds are not changed, they just shake them off and put them back down! The robes are not washed either, I had on a robe for a facial (waste of money) and a bikini wax after I took the robe off she took it and hung it back up for the next person to use, I could'nt believe it. My husband and I also had the Coconut Fantasy and who knows how many times the robes had been used. The trollies are great, I never had a problem getting one and if it was full the walk to the front was nice anyway. Walk off some of the yucky food you ate. I would not say that this is a 5 star resort due the problems I encountered, but it is beautiful to be fair. I would not advise going off the resort to shop! I hate when they almost snatch you and make you take a look at their shops, it was very uncomfortable and No Thank You does not work. I would just rather spend extra money and buy at the resort and feel safe. The outback safari tour is nice but way overpriced. It is however the best food that you will encounter the duration of your stay though. Go with a VERY open mind and things will be okay, there will be more bugs in your rooms than you think!!! Believe me.

<Content>Nice, relaxing vacation I was concerned about this hotel from reading past reviews, but it was better than I thought it would be. It is a beautiful hotel-nice pool and beach. Most of the staff were courteous and helpful, with only a few rude bartenders being the exception. As far as tipping goes, I did not once see another guest tip an employee and I did not feel as though we were treated differently either way. We tipped those bartenders and cleaning staff who were especially helpful and pleasant. I was worried that we would regret not becoming VIP, which is now called the Platinum Club. I am glad we did not spend the extra money. Walking to pick up towels near the pool in the morning did not cramp our style. Also, the mixed drinks with local liquor and local beer were fine for us. However, the wine was not good-the white wine was especially watered down. The red was slightly better. I am not sure if the wine is any different in Platinum Club. Making reservations for the specialty restaurants was not as much trouble as past reviews had stated-you are able to book for two nights at a time and it took me approx. 10 minutes of standing in line to make reservations. Chopin was a buffet-so I was disappointed because I thought it was a plated dinner. The food was not much different from the Hispaniola Buffet. I would suggest going there only if you were going late enough to catch the piano/music show they have (not sure what night).El Gaucho was good-a beautiful spot by the water and the steak was good. Be aware that the appetizers are not always what they sound like. Bella Pasta was good. Hispaniola Buffet for the rest of the nights was OK-many of the meats were undercooked and the food quality overall was not great. They do have a pasta bar every night and the salad was pretty good. For breakfast, the buffet was pretty good-the pancakes and waffles are in a separate section and were generally warm, unlike some of the items in the main area of the buffet. They do not have orange juice, but they do have orange drink and a juice smoothie bar. I would highly recommend the egg station for fried eggs and omelettes. We had lunch at the beach/pool area buffet. I ate pizza and french fries almost every day. They deep fry the hot dogs, but they are not bad. The nighttime entertainment was not the best, but they do try to put on a good show. The karaoke was quite funny (one night per week). There are so many activities all day long by the pool and beach. It is a fun place to be. The days were so relaxing and the weather was great. We had one day that was not sunny, so we walked across the street and shopped, along with sitting outside on our awesome balcony playing cards. The rooms were great-nice and big. My only complaint about the room is that you cannot see the TV from the bed. The coffee in the rooms was good, but don't forget to let cleaning lady know what you need/what you are running out of (sugar,creamer, spoon). Probably the worst aspect of the trip was the rude guests. People would cut right in front of you while waiting for a drink-men included. They seemed to have a sense of entitlement and a total lack of regard and consideration for others. These people would cut you and push by you so that they could get the last seats on the tram that takes you around the resort. I would say that at least 75-80% of the guests were of European descent. Very few of us spoke english and it was great to meet fellow North Americans.Overall, the trip was good. My husband and I made the most out of it and really enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere.

<Content>Overall...it was great!! My wife and I went from 12th to the 19th Dec, 12th being our 6 month wedding aniversary, so it came out like a 2nd honeymoon.I had read a few reviews and like always you remember only the bad things, which was okay. Our check-in took only a few minutes, kindly being served a bohio while we waited. We stayed in a room just by the reception ( condo 51)which came in handy during the day, but was terrible at night because of all entertainment a few feet away. After 3 nights we asked to move to another room and there was no problem at all, everything was arranged in a few minutes. So if you can, stay away from area 51.The garden work is fantastic, and the peacocks walking on your lawn is something you wake up to in the morning, especialy in area 51. They have pink Flamingos, ducks, geese, parrots, you name it. Had no problems with hot water. Had no problems with theft, you just have to be carefull...use your safe, and watch your stuff on the beach, although it seemed sometimes that the biggest threat came from the tourists themselves! Food at the Buffet was good. we ate at a few of the restaurants, book ahead, have breakfast early and the waiting line will be shorter. Thats hard especialy in the caribean...and all the rum on the night before!!El Guacho was great, so as The Pescador and Sakura (tip of advice, dine at 10, things go much faster). We went to Licey, paid the extra 25 bucks, fancy french cuisine,a bit expensive (wine not included) but diferent from the rest, especialy on my wife's birthday, I love her, she deserves it. The beach is awesome, I love the Palm trees, white sand and turquoise warm waters which gives it that real tropical feling. By the way, we passed through another resort on the south side of the Island on our way to Samana, and the beach wasn麓t what it is in Bavaro, so make the most of it. Enjoy the bar on the beach, those guys work hard to keep the drinks going.Tha staff were so helpful and freindly, always eager to please, they realy apreciate a small tip every now and then, I wish I could have given more. Being polight goes both ways, and knowing there names brings a sparkle in the eye. Even though we would get 2 mai-tai instead of one mai-tai and a pina-colada like we asked, its the caribean, not Europe or the US where someone would get fired for something like that. So relax and enjoy another way of life.The only thing that REALLY annoyed us was when some people from Royal Holidays aproached us to sell holiday memberships. We lost almost 3 hours, and were constantly pressured into buying the membership by 4 diferent individuals, as if we were dum not to. We left their office ( which is in same round building in the pond as Licey) really really upset.Besides that it was great, it turned out like a second honeymoon for us, and we did like the hotel, the people, and the island.p.s. if you can take a few excursions, there is so much to see.

<Content>Nature is beautiful, but ... This hotel has a lot of buts. Territory is great, but there is a smelly sewage station close to villas 20/21/22. We were in the 12th one, but had to move to a different side of the hotel because of the smell and noise from the show in the neighbor hotel in the evening. Walking trails are great, but they are used by trollies also, and small cars, and motorbikes (owned by the service personnel). No service roads... Room is good, but who decided to put these four huge clay vases (two of them are lamps) into the mirrored corner? So, you have to look at 16 huge vases every day - it's kinda depressing... A/C is leaking, hot water almost isn't running... Gym is good, but threadmill is out of service... Sauna exists, but the male section is out of service... Tennis courts exist, but they aren't lit in the evening... Ping-pong tables exist, but you need to return the net exactly at 5PM... We couldn't exchange our towels - no cards... Shows are OK, but no discotheque...Also this hotel is contaminated by unfriendliness and even rudeness. One example - a housemaid couldn't wait for two minutes, so I had to change my shorts in the bathroom. May be, she just didn't understand English, but she could see me with a towel around my hips...But nature was beautiful (they even had their own piece of wild jungle with exotic birds - not smelly!!!), beaches were perfect, sailing was exciting. Overall grade - C.

<Content>Looks Will Fool You My wife and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess Hotel Dec.03 to the 10th 2005. By the look of the lobby, you are filled with a sense of opulent granduer. It is all open air concept with marble floors at various levels, numerous cosy couches and chairs,and 3 courtyards filled with ponds, full grown coconut palm trees, and various plants too numerous to mention. After checking in we had a drink at one of the bars, then caught a shuttle to our fourplex near the beach. We were hungry so we walked a short distance to the complex on the beach where they served various finger foods from 12am - 6am. One of the things you will notice is the Dominicans run on a 24 hour clock. There was pizza, french fries, chicken fingers, salads, fruit and wine and beer. It was all good fare.The fun started when we went back to our room. We figured we would have a hot shower before bed. Well there was no hot water. Apparently a pipe had burst and half the resort was without it. The problem was not fixed for three days. When it was fixed there was no acknowlegement by the staff at the hotel that it had even happened. If you are used to using a face cloth, take one with you because unless you speak Spanish, the maid will look at you like you are speaking Russian when you ask for one. There aren't any. They give you a key and lock to the wall safe for a reason. My wife had left a silver bracelet in her make-up bag, in our room. Let's just say the maid did a little more cleaning that she should have. Apart from these setbacks we actually had a very goodtime till the last night. My wife developed a stomach infection from something she ate at the resort. I know this because, this was the reason the doctor at the Punta Cana Hospital gave me at 5:30 in the morning the day we left. Luckily I am covered by a Medi-Passport through my employment and will be reimbursed for the $643.25 US his services cost us. One other thing, you cannot cash your traveller's checks at the hotel. Well you can, but they will only change them into pesos. There is a bank in town a short walk away.

<Content>It was a good time and beautiful hotel This was me and my fiances first time to the Dominican, and a friend had already been there twice. We went with really no expectactions and we quite pleased. It was hot hot hot down there and we were pleased to get a room by the beach with some super strong AC. It was absolutely freezing in our room at all times! How wonderful when it is do darn humid down there. The beach is truly the gem of this resort. Turquoise water, literally no seaweed and nice white sand. Absolutely breathtaking! The resort is HUGE and there are trollies that pick you up fairly close to where you are on the resort. We were often seranaded while being driven by one of the friendly drivers as well. Reuben and Maximo at the pool bar are the best, even if Reuben doesn't speak english! He would often personalize the blender drinks with hearts made with chocolate syrup for me. How sweet! We went with Signature and they arranged a free tour to the Vivaldi cigar factory a short drive away. Dont be shocked when you are being driven around down there, they are crazy drivers and will swerve all around the roads. Its pretty exciting. Being a concierge myself, I had a few questions about upgrading to VIP. I had spoken with Antonio at the Front Desk a few days prior and he made sure we were given a fabulous room and even sent us a letter a few days into our trip saying hello. We had no idea he had arranged this!! He was so happy to meet us in person and was such a nice guy. The women staff are always smiling and cleaning up drinks for you.The food, at times weren't the greatest. But I must say if you have an open mind about new cuisines, they give you plenty of options. The pasta was fabulous, on Wednesday we had bacon wrapped chicken and wonderful pork!!! We had to go back for seconds!! you just have to get over the fact the their cattle and chicken is much different then ours. The fruit was pretty tasteless, but their yogourt is smashing!The a la carte are ok, I wouldn't suggest the Argentinean Steakhouse....especially the caesar salad. All in all, the breakfasts and lunches were very diverse and delicious. We brought lots of gifts for the maid, and found that it really didn't do much in the way of extras like all our friends had said in past trips to the Dominican. We did it for the people anyways, but it would've been nice to have some perks. A tip, your mini fridge is in the desk. Apparently no one found it on there own.We went just at the end of the 'dead' season and believe me it was pretty busy but not at night. The disco in the casino was always empty and really nothing much to do exept the show at 10. We honestly did not meet anyone under 50 that would talk to us. SOOOOOO many Europeans, which is fine but can be a bit tough to talk to people who don't speak any english. I would suggest travelling in a group. We wish we did. Only the pool by the beach was open when we were there which is fine , we were barely in the pool but there is one near the lobby. I suggest upgrading to VIP because the alcohol down there tastes like rubbing alcohol (its locally made)Going out there are shopping centres out front and to the left, we suggest going to the Plaza Bavaro and going to the shop across from the famous jeweller down there (for real Larymar-dominican stone)They will cross the street and run you down to get you in their stores. All in all I would go back but not for some time, this resort was absolutely beautiful and you somewhat feel secluded but is right in the hub of a lot of shops and things to do.Go there you will not be disappointed, don't listen to these people who got ticked if the weather wasn't right. We went right at the tail end of the hurricane, it rained almost every night, but was bright and sunny during the day. You will love it

<Content>had a fabulous time My best friends, my sister and I just got back from a girl's trip to the Bavaro Princess.We had a blast.The resort itself is immaculate,the grounds are extremely well maintained.The beach was great.We never had a problem getting a palapa on the beach.Our room was near the beach.The staff was extremely friendly and helpfull.The food was just ok. We did gaucho's which I thought was very good.Bella Pasta was excellent.El pescador was terrible.So we just ate at hispaniola most of the nights.We did go v.i.p. and am glad we did so.We enjoyed the water sports, the free massage and the free rum in our suite.The hot water is an issue they need to work on.I ended up taking quick luke warm showers. The secret is try to get a shower before 5pm because it seems at 6pm everybody showers and then there are no pressure nor hot water. Overall it was great.We did not go there expecting a five star resort. We went with an open mind.We had read all the bad reviews and I am surprised at all the negative comments.Keep an open mind and you will enjoy it. We went there to have a good time and we definetly did!

<Content>Bavaro Princess- Incredible environment! Overall - I would recommend the Bavaro Princess. Below are the specifics. Please....remember that any review of any hotel is relative to what the visitor is used to! If you only stay in 5 star resorts, realize you are on a developing island that has not had years of experience with tourism like Jamaica or the Virgin Islands. If you saved your whole life for this one trip and have never been anywhere, of course it will all seem perfect with nothing else to compare it to! Here goes: Who am I? I am an X travel agent who has travelled all my life to all types of islands and all levels of accomodations. I was born and raised in Columbus, OH but spent 3 years in NYC and 3 years in Silicon Valley so I understand expectations of Midwest, East and West coast all vary GREATLY! I am 42, divorced mom with 2 kids 9 and 11. We traveled with my boyfriend who has traveled domestically but not internationally and is willing to try anything and everything and... has a restaurant/bartending background. He works for Homeland Security now and so we are always curious about safety. We saw lots of cops on bikes and very unobtrusive patrols along the beach. No incidents and felt OK to have kids at pool when we hung at beach. I took 3 years of Spanish in H.S. and remembered more than I ever thought I would. He knew zero Spanish and we both did fine. My kids loved trying the new words. We did check out Spanish language book from library and brought it with us in case of emergency.Package was thru Apple after getting blown out from Mexico thanks to Hurricane Emily. Traveled the day after Tgiving for 7 nights. Charter flight, non-stop in 3 hours we were there (from Cleveland). No problems.Arrived - typical island airport. Take your picture with locals in costume and offer it for sale when you return back in a week for $10. No one tells you this but... upon arrival, fill out a declaration form at a large central table upon arrival. Have a pen handy. One per person including kids. The fee is $10. They are tourist cards and required to leave the country so keep them tucked away. You pay in US dollars before you even make it to customs counter.Have your passport and tourist cards out and any other documentation. Since I was traveling without my children's father, I needed a NOTARIZED letter from him granted permission to travel with them out of the country. Do NOT forget this!!! They ask upon arrival back in the U.S. and may or may not ask in the Dominican but if they ask and you do NOT have it, you will be denied access to the country. Got our luggage, Apple rep took us out to the van and we had a quick 1/2 hour hop to the Bavaro Princess. 3 other hotels were represented by the passengers. Always ask distance from hotel to airport in travel time - not distance. It can be 10 miles but in heavy scooter/bus traffic, it can take an hour. You see a bit of the countryside and a feel for the poverty that exists here. My kids caught on quick.Hotel is all open air which was wonderful. We never felt compelled to find A/C but our room was always almost too cold. We kept blinds shut and had morning sun. Perhaps afternoon sun made rooms hot. The Casino is just outside the main gate. Very basic. It's about 1/2 block walk from the lobby as is a small shopping center with two levels of shops if you are up for haggling. More later. There is an ATM dispensing Dominican dollars (good thing for souvenier). It's by Bell Hop station in lobby by driveway. Also a small game room there which we discovered the last day - air hockey, foosball, etc...Check in was quick and trying to use my Spanish did help. We were in room 085 which was just 4 buildings (bungalows with 4 units per) from the pool at the swim up bar. There was a chain link fence dividing us from next hotel but it wasn't obtrusive. Rooms are very very generous and very clean. We had 2 messy kids and no ants or anything but again -it's an island!!! If you freak out over a cricket or a chameleon, do not go to the islands!!! We had a double pull out couch, a table and 2 chairs, large desk/dresser unit with TV and fridge a coffee bar area the length of a twin bed plus a twin bed for my son. Up one step to the king bed, dresser and down one step around the corner to the large dressing area, ironing board, safe, then separate area for toilet and shower. BIG. Blow dryer meant no need to haul that with us. Toiletries are provided so let maid know if you need more conditioner or whatever (my daughter had long hair and regretted not doing the $1/braid thing early in the trip. A few jaunts into the ocean waves meant tangled hair!)Shower - pressure and heat were erratic but we used a toothbrush end to push up the stopper that transferred the flow from spigot to shower. Also took off shower head (just unscrew) and could get a straight stream if you wanted but just taking it off then back on gave us triple pressure so we were good.Maid - wonderful, friendly. We left her a list of each item we wanted in fridge and it was there. X cokes, x sprite, x beer and then two big gallon jugs of water. (used dictionary for assistance but we mimed with as well). We didn't have any problems with getting sick or the water but we also used only jug water for teeth and didn't let water run in our mouth during showers. My boyfriend even at Pigs Feet and was fine which would have set me off big time! I will say I'm a sheet snob and they could have been better quality. I always take my own $$$ pillowcases - quirky I know! Humor me!Grounds - spectacular. Period. And yes, it's a big area. Which meant no feeling of crowds. If you breakfast at the buffet near the lobby, there are 3 pink flamingos. If you bring out bread and offer it to them (sit low on the edge of pond), they'll hand feed! TOOOOOOO fun for my kids! And me! (I love mingos!) Note - do not miss the little zoo that runs through the center of the resort. It is not marked as such but there are paths around to about 20 rustic cages w assorted birds, iguana, etc. You'll see the main bridge from the giant fountain if you ride the shuttle. Other entrance is real near Licey restaurant which is near front lobby.Shuttle - we had no issues. There are set stops around the resort like a bus route. It is not a random start/stop like a taxi. Stand at a stop and ... they stop! Hail them or yell for them to stop simply because you want them to and they won't. Duh! They'd never make it around a resort. You get a map at check in. Mark the stops and go where they are. We walked except when kids were beat.Restaurants - 1000 opinions are already posted. We liked steak at El Gaucho the best. Chopin piano boat was cheesy but cute. She sang - 5 songs folks so don't think you're missing some singing phenom! Nice voice. Kids amused. Enough said. Advice- when you go to breakfast, make your reservations for the next 2 days. If you are down there by 8 a.m., you're fine. Worse case you eat at the buffet whenever you are hungry. Reminder- you are on an island. Things must be shipped in. This is a developing tourist area. Things are not filet mignon and french pastries. Everything was presented well, replenished as needed with only a few rolls ever seeming a bit stale. The milk is island milk so it is different than ours. Skim is close to ours but even in coffee, it's different. Kids did fine. Pasta is well done and freshly prepared for you as are several other things every night in every restaurant. I am a VERY VERY picky eater and I did fine. My boyfriend loved trying things at his leisure - everything from caviar to the pigs feet. My kids stuck with pasta, chicken, fries, rolls, cereal, fruit, smoothies, and too many virgin strawberry daiquiris! Food - if you are a huge foodie - don't go here. Go to NYC. Islands are different.Booze - we did NOT get VIP and never cared. Saved the $100 per person. Location of room was great, don't care about robes or a massage or hanging out in a platinum lounge with a big TV. It was always deserted anyway. Licey restaurant also looked deserted but felt no need to go there. Booze- you can buy across the street for cheap (little bottle of rum), we don't smoke (bought 2 cigars in hotel shop for gifts). It just didn't make sense and we never missed it. Bartender- loved Maximo on the dry side of the pool bar. He was great with our kids, always remembered our drinks, made them perfectely and we tipped him mid week and again at the end.. BIG RECOMMENDATION! Take insulated coffee mugs or large thermos type drink holders. Even the most frozen drink was liquified immediately. It's an island thing. We saw quite a few folks comment how smart we were and the bartenders gave us a big thumbs up because they knew. Also, it's really enough to hold 2-3 drinks which was great for long walks on the beach.BEACH - UNBELIEVABLE! Powder white sand, rough-ish surf when we were there due to it being windy but we just got the boogie boards and played like otters and had a blast riding the waves. It was calm the last half of the week. We walked over an hour both ways and checked out other hotels, and LOVED people watching. Lots of topless women, thongs and speedos so remember there is the European element. It was actually very nice to see so many women in bikinis without bikini perfect bodies. All ages from seniors on down to high schoolers were in bikinis. Body type was not something to be self conscious about there. No one was. I am heavier than I want to be and walked away afterward realizing it really didn't make a bit of difference to men or women there. Made for interesting dinner conversation with my kids.Let's see - food, booze, shuttle, beach, language, ... oh yea excursions!1. Every comment we heard about Outback Safari trip was negative. Too long, too hot, too dusty, too rugged. It's a full day tour so be prepared to think rough and ready.2. We did Marinarium and got the best deal anywhere. $65 per adult and kids under 12 were 1/2 price. We did morning departure. There in 1/2 hour. On the boat, great staff, fun atmosphere, updated sanitized equipment, optional flippers. We did advanced snorkel which only meant 15 more minutes so even if you are a first timer, you can do it. (Beginner 30 minute swim, advanced 45 minute. It goes by fast!). Swim around a bit of a reef for 15 minutes then loop around the boat to the netted shark area. Swim over net into large pens about 7-10 feet deep water. Nurse sharks are large as are the rays. They require a floatation belt for EVERYONE so if you are hot to take close pictures of the sharks, you have to discretely remove the belt, hold in one hand and dive down alongside them and have a friend take a picture. No fear, just awe. Everyone LOVED it! They took a land picture of everyone ($10 per 5x7 available at dock). We took ours with snorkel gear on which we recommend. More candid! Then you cruise along the coast with great music, dancing, they give you a lesson on coco loco drink making, cocktails and sandwiches are available. You then dock in shallows - 3 feet of water. Hang for around 30 minutes with staff bringing out cocktails on floating mini bars. Mini booze cruise ish with everyone passing a ball around and taking pictures and just taking in paradise. Cruise back and everyone is just ready to ride on home in the motorcoach. Back by 12:30.Other highlights - they have a monkey, parrots, a snake and iguana and the dancers available for pictures. They place the animal on you and take your photo (see the attached photos of my kids). It's optional BUT they only keep the photos for 3 days. We learned and had them set ours aside at the photo shop under our room number. Then we pulled the ones we wanted each day that were posted up by the lobby/photo shop. By then end, we had over 25 pictures! We kept 10 and paid $5 per but quality was amazing and as a photographer, I really appreciated them.Evening shows - don't start until 10pm which was late! We stayed up one night and had a blast at the show and dancing in the lobby afterward. You can only drink in the lobby bar at night so no drunken folks wandering from the pool or wherever to all hours. The pool bar closed at 7 pm. They did have a Russian tourist get very very beligerant when he was cut off. He needed cut off along time prior and had passed out and woke up mad the bar was closed. They had a dozen police officers just keeping him contained and finally we were told by Maximo the doctor came and gave him a shot! So he slept THAT one off! He said that was very very very unusual.Overall recommendations.1. bring coffee/thermos drink mugs.2. bring a bottle of suntan lotion (30 spf) PER PERSON. You will go through it and assume you will lose at least one bottle. it is $17 per bottle to buy there. We found pharmacy on 2nd level of mini mall across street as the cheapest spot and it was $17.3. If you love to shop, you can go over but they are aggressive. Everyone has same stuff so browse the first time and go back with price and decision in your head. Think of what souvenier you want. We brought back a small piece of art with Dominican symbols, bought coffee in the airport ($6 per lb), and a little mamajuana kit in the airport for $9. To explain - mamajuana is a local drink that is suppose to be an aphrodesiac. (sp?). It consists of bark/leaves, red wine, rum and honey. You'll get a taste offered to you somewhere and everywhere! It's strong but very unique. Only other truly unusual thing is locally mined jewel called Larimar.Blue in color. Check out in hotel jewelry shop. Most pieces were multiple hundred so we didn't do that. Could have skipped shopping but fun to just look.4. Take care of staff. They are friendly and hard working. We pre-tipped the maid and the bartender $10 per and then tipped again at the end. We tipped a couple waitresses that we saw a lot and asked for their section when we could - even at buffets. 5. Hotel/Airport Check out - do NOT forget documents, tourist card, i.d. and to check out as early as you can. You only need to pay for room charges and to RETURN your safe key and that's it. At certain times, there were lines. Also, call for shuttle 2 hours before you need it. They have a LOT to pick up and we almost had to hand carry to lobby despite giving them 1 hour notice. I think that's it. Questions? email me at kjaeger@columbus.rr.com. Oveall - we had a blast. Great weather, amazing beach and surroundings and staff, kids were throughly thrilled. We'd go back. I do always recommend to anyone from U.S. to travel with peanut butter and a box of Saltines. It's a little bit of home, good protein and can help if your stomach gets upset. We felt safe, relaxed and had a blast. Again, realize what is truly important to you (food, walking a beach, snorkeling from the beach, big room, kids program, whatever) and go from there. To expect Vegas quality shows and rare French wine and a porterhouse is just being ignorant of where you are. Enjoy the experience and relax! Cheers!Kim

<Content>Fantastic Originally were in a junior quite, however found it to not have been cleaned. Upon complaint to the front desk were promptly moved to a full suite/villa. Any complaints or concerns were dealt with satisfactorilly and in a timely manner. However there was really very little to complain about... the staff were FANTASTIC. The food was very good, the activites and shows were great as well. The resort is really beautiful, although very large which can be daunting at first. Definately a place worth returning to, very much worth what you pay for it. Had a great time all around.

<Content>All round great trip! Me and my boyfriend went to Bavaro Princess for my 21st birthday (Happy Birthday Me). We flew out from the UK on 14th November 2005. It was a long flight of 9 hours. We arrived at Punta Cana airport at 2.00 pm (local time). Pretty straight forward through the airport, although the last thing you want after a long flight is to have your picture taken! And because we were from the UK we needed a visa it was a little bit frantic getting one. If you didnt have a pen you had to wait for 1 pen to passed around between 300 people. (Luckily we had one). Lugage reclaim was very quick. (Just enough time to have a smoke.) The transfer to the hotel took overall 30 mins. We had to drop others off first.(We are always the last) Checking in could of been easier. Although our bags were taken off us by the staff to be taken to our room for us! There were 2 downsides to our Checking in experience First of all the Receptionist gave us the wrong room number. We had to walk to find the wrong room (we didnt know about the bus service that takes you to your room) it was a good 15 mins walk. (The last thing you need after a 9 hour flight from a cold climate with your sweats on to a HOT climate) We past one of the staff who had seen us walking round looking lost, and he guided us to our Right room. Secondly, when we got there our room wasnt ready. We had no key in our welcome pack. The maid let us in. So far our first day was pretty memorable dont you think! But all was forgotton when we seen our room. It was amazing to say the least! Very spacious and comfortable. Definatly 5 star. We ate at all 7 resturants. Heres my verdict on them all:Hispanola, main buffet- Food could be better and warmer, but there is quite a bit of choice.Chopin- We were told this was a la carte. We were proved wrong. We didnt like the service and felt as though we were in a sardines can!Sakura- Very nice, not a lot of choice but what you do decide on is filling.El Pescador- Food was lovley. We had the lobster. Service was poor. Bella Pasta- I loved this. If you like pasta then you will love it too! Service was pretty quick.El Goucho- This is the worst. You have to like steak, thats all that was on the menu. Service was awful, food was dreadful. I had a bad stomach for the next 2 days because of this.Licey- Now here is one that i will never forget! The food was out of this world. You were treated like kings and queens. The staff couldnt do enough for you. We went to this on my birthday, it made it that extra bit special. I still have the taste of the food in my mouth 2 weeks on. It is soooo worth the extra $25 each. (We didnt go platinum)The beach was perfect although not enough huts. White sandy beach and crystal clear waters. Absolute paradise.The pool area was huge. Plenty of space, Swim up bar (for the cocoloco's).By the end of my 2 weeks at the Bavaro Princess we didnt want to come home from such luxury. Coming home.Punta Cana airport is very un-organised. We left our hotel at 11.30am. Our flight wasnt till 5.00 pm. We thought we would be stuck in the terminal for hours, but it turned out that we had just enough time to have a drink. The check-in took up all the time. So slow.But now we are back home, wishing we were there again. Although we had one or two down-falls, there was a million ups to our holiday of a life time. It will NEVER be forgotton.I hope this review helps you!

<Content>Beautiful Hotel - Lousy Food I just spent 7 nights at the Bavaro Princess from Sat November 19th through Saturday November 26th. Overall I found the resort to be very beautiful and a good value for the money. Here is a breakdown of my review:Check In:Check in was as smooth as could be. We had rooms (building 5) right by the beach and the pool and most of the beach front restaurants. Very convienent.Rooms:Rooms were beautiful and spacious. All rooms are suites. The bathroom was gorgeous. My only complaint was not enough haggars for our clothes and no drawers. The bar did not have draws or cabinets and I found the space under the bar wasteful. Air conditioning was wonderful in the room and the beds although nothing special were suprisingly comfortable.Pool:The beach has pretty rough seas for the kids so we spent most of the time at the pool. It was very clean and no residue on the pool surface as I have experienced at many other resorts in the caribbean. The pool was relatively warm once you were in and very spacious. The kids had a ball. Beach:I found the beach quite beautiful with palms and soft sand, however the beach surf was very rough and wavy. I wished it were calmer waters. I thought being the caribbean it would have been calmer for the kids. I found out later the waters in the DR are actually the atlantic. It certainly was not the resorts fault, my travel agent should have been more specific when asked about the beaches. Chairs are hard to come by after 11 and you can forget a palapa. Overall beach was very pleasant and I enjoyed it very muchFood:Ok this is where I found the hotel had much room for improvement. The food was just horrendous. The variety was poor, the quality of the food was poor. The selection and the overall taste. I lived on French fries and pizza all week. I found nothing was very good and several in our party got diarrea from the food. All the other guest we met during the week complained about the food as well. The restaurants at night were barely edible and the restaurants were all short staffed. I have been to many all inclusive chains including Barcelo, Iberostar, Melia, Paradisus, Palladium, Riu etc and this was by far the worst food I ever had at a resort. If you like to eat you will be very disappointed.Resort Grounds:I found the grounds spectacular. The flowers, trees, grass, etc were just beautiful and so perfectly maintained. I was blown away. The resort is quite large and you do need to take trams if you do not want to walk 10-15 minutes to the lobby. I found that most times they came pretty often but were very full if you were staying upfront close to the beach Several times we had to wait for another to come. Lobby:Very nice and lively with a theater, buffet restaurant and some shops. Bars:Drinks were good and the bartenders very nice. I have read reviews were drink wait times were long. I did not find that at all. I got drink service very quickly and the drinks were good. If you wanted more top shelf liquor I did not have to pay for it and they gladly gave you the better liquor. Cocolocos, pina coladas, daquiries and the banana royals were very good and very much enjoyed by the family.Casio:Very small but got the job done. We had a fun and it was nice to be able to gamble a little. Lastly, I wanted to make an observation. The resort is mostly frequented by Europeans. It seems to be the case for Punta Cana in general. I know many people say that Americans or New Yorkers specifically are very agressive and pushy but I must say we are mild by comparison to the Europeans. They are very pushy and brazen. Americans are accustom to waiting on line and waiting our turn. Europeans do not get this concept and just push there way in and out and cut you right off. They were also quite rude on the trams. They just push there way on the trams and will knock you and your family over to get a seat. A few times I had to be agressive to equalize the situation. I was very taken back. So to my fellow americans know that cultural differences exist at this resort desitnation and you should be mindful of this if this presents a problem for you and your travel companions. Also my family and I did not get the VIP package and to be honest I did not see the point. My sister and I called the hotel in advance and they put my entire family (10 of us) in the same building by the beach with all the ammenities of the VIP package. We were able to make our reservations in advance, we were able to get the beach towels in our rooms and we got anything we wanted to drink without paying extra. We also did not pay to eat at Licey's either since we complained to management about the food. I cannot see spending the extra money for a 20 minute massage or cigars. Save your money. To sum up my review. I liked Punta Cana and will probably return some day but unless the food drastically improves at the Princess I do not see myself of my family returning ot the resort. One can not live on french fries alone. Good luck with your trip and enjoy your stay. The hotel is still a good value overall just plan ahead to make the vacation as enjoyable as possible. Oh I almost forgot. Be prepared for the airport. It was very rural and was basically a big Palapa hut. Very disorganized and hot. Do not dress very warmly if you are traveling from colder climate you will die from the heat waiting 2 hours for your plane. The wait to get through customs leaving and the airport security took over 2 hours so give yourself plenty of time. I was really taken back by how poorly run the airport was leaving. Coming to Punta Cana was very easy. I hope this review was helpful

<Content>Exceeded Expectations Just got back from Bavaro Princess and the resort exceeded our expecations. For the price, this resort provides great value. The rooms are all suites and marble and very large. We opted to upgrade to Platinum ($35 per day more) and it was worth it. We had a room very close to the beach and pool. Platinum also gets turndown every night, beach towels, free room service (which is very good and very fast). You can check main hotel web site for more info (---------).Platinum has its own lounge and concierge who make all reservations for you via phone (very nice) and there is continental breakfast and afternoon sandwiches available. There is also unlimted water, beer and soda there. The food was relatively good (not 5 star, but then the cost for the resort is very reasonable). Could have used more variety in the food at the buffets by main building and beach, but there is no limit to the restaurants.The staff is very friendly, we enjoyed meeting many of them. Although not necessary a little bit of spanish and a dollar now and then go a very long way.The resort is large, however the trolleys operated very often. The beach is beautiful. The sand is the consistency of sugar.The entertainment was also very good. You really don't need to leave the resort. The weather was beautiful (every day 15-30 mins of rain) and there were nice puffy clouds that circle the island providing a little bit of shade from time to time.My daughter got an ear infection there and the Platinum staff called the doctor who met us at the on-site office in 15 mins. She was excellent, provided my daughter with 2 shots and antibiotics. Not cheap ($200) but what piece of mind!!!If you don't like Europeans (I do) you won't like it here. A lot of Spanish, some Germans and Canadians. Lots of topless sunbathing.Hope this was helpful.

<Content>The Good and Not So Good Our family just returned from a wedding week trip and our group of 19 staying at the Princess in the first week of November. Which overall was great but I suspect the influx in mid November may very much change the dynamic with all those people heading here to sub for their intended trips to hurricane devasted Mexico, Cuba and Florida. ( Which indeed was the fear of the resort's staff that their own vacation time was now over!)The housekeeping staff were just great, the bartenders at all sites showed a great sense of humor - don't order a rum and Coke Cuba Libre since Cuba is not libre and try a Dominicana Libre instead! The front desk staff were friendly and efficient.The food was genrally great with the exception of the Sakura specialty restaurant where trying to offer the fare of some eight far-Eastern countries proved too much of a challenge and only the Chinese duck with hoisin sauce pleased our group of diners. The mandatory in-person reservation system for the various specialty restaurants on site was also a bit of a headache as people lined up for an hour to get their names on that night's reservation list only to see their dining area half empty when they arrived at the appointed time. (The impression was that the Princess establishment would much prefer you to take the easy way out and dine in the regular buffet halls on site.)Fish chowders/soups at all sites were excellent!One heads up is for those seeking to use the new internet cafe on site, by the frog pond, to post their e-mails and business mail back home...One of our party, who owns a printing and office supply business back in Toronto, Ontario, had the unfortunate experience of finding that a simple message to his secretary back home had an attachment added on when it arrived at the Toronto office. When the secretary opened the attachment from her boss it crashed the whole computer system with a Trojan virus that took a week of expert help to eliminate! Message - be careful what you send Internet home from the Dominican Republic, and make sure your virus definitions are very much up to date.

<Content>What to know about the Princess We spent 2 weeks at the Princess and it was wonderfull. The reception was a little slow but nevertheless they offered us their big smile. Excellent service at the main restaurant although most of them do not speak english. The animation was great. The only minus was the distance from our room to the beach, we always had to catch a small train. The hotel is located in front of a small shoppingcenter which was pretty expensive. At the beach you can get better deals. The excursions at the hotel were expensive and very commercialized. Luckily we met a nice person who does private excursions with small groups. We had a great time discovering real country life at reasonable prices. For more information you can always send a mail to ----Our stay couldn麓t have been better and definitely we are going back

<Content>Good holiday We went to the Bavaro Princess last Christmas and had a fairly good vacation. We were at the resort right after the hurricane and there was still some damage to the vegetation, but we found it to be ok. The food was pretty good but we found a lot of it to be tasteless and bland. The resort itself is quite nice, and the employees were constantly working and trying to improve our vacation. Ill have to say that the best part of our vacation was the beach. It was beautiful with powdery white sands, streaming palms, and beautiful turquoise waters. The only thing that we didn't like about the resort was its size. Its just too big, especially when your placed in a building towards the back of the resort. The trams were fairly efficient but it was quite a hassle getting around the resort. From the lobby to the beach it's about a 15 min walk depending on how fast you walk. Anyways other than that, we had a fairly good holiday

<Content>Never go back We stayed at the bavaro princess the week of 10/16. the grounds are beautiful, the villas are nice, most staff was good. unless you spoke the language especially at the pool bar you were just looked over and standing there waiting for a drink. even tipping didn't help. you would tip the first day and they be good for a while, but the next day its like they did not even know you. food was ok, but they don't tell you upon arrival to make your reservations for the rest of your stay, because if you don't you're stuck eating at the buffet every night. because of hotel not being full, they closed some restaurants so whatever was open, you could not get a reservation unless you go to the lobby at 8am and stand there in line to make your reservation which i think if you are on vacation and relaxing, the last think you want to do is worry about reservations for dinner.The one big problem i did have is no air conditioning anywhere except 2 restaurants and your villa. All i know is that when i eat, i need to be confortable. Knowing that there was no airconditioning, just figured there would be some sort of a breeze, well that did not happen, so you are there eating and sweating in your good clothes, also if were were luckly enough to get a reservation at one of the restaurants without air conditioning, they require the men to where long pants, all i know is that my husband was not a happy camper doing this, but it did not happen anyway, because we ate at the buffet most nights, so that was not an issue. We did eat one night at Licey which was somewhat air conditioned.Entertainment was ok, but never wanted to go because club was not air conditioned either. So there was not much to do at night except the casino which thank god it was air conditioned.Room was kept clean and tipping the maid she put fresh flowers in our room which was very nice.We decided to go VIP, which did not make much difference, we still got a room near the lobby because we were told no rooms were available. So either we walked or took the tram near the lobby if you were lucky to get on it. Now mind you, when you are in another country, i guess its just a free for all. I know when i wait for something and someone is in front of me, you just wait your turn, well not here, people are very pushy, so when the tram comes to pick you up, its like a free for all, and whoever can get a seat, gets it, every by pushing people out of the way.I guess if you don't mind what i mentioned, its a nice place, but i will never return.

<Content>Beautiful Beach After reading reviews, I was a bit nervous about going to the Bavaro Princess. When we arrived, I was very pleasantly surprised! The lobby is beautiful - peaceful, tropical setting. Room: Ours was upstairs, 3 buildings back from the beach pool. The rooms were very nice, large, comfortable, and yes, clean. (Our room was usually made up around 3 pm.) Our room didn't happen to have any hot water. We got used to taking quick showers. Some rooms, however, did have hot water. (Hot water seems to be a common problem among many resorts in DR.) The AC worked great and was loud enough to drown out any noise from outside. TV gets alot of channels, including CNN and ESPN.Grounds: very nicely kept. The pool was very nice, but I must say the beach was probably the prettiest of any I've seen in the Caribbean/Atlantic. It was huge, and you could safely and comfortably take long walks along the shore. The beach at the Bavaro Princess seemed so much larger than beaches at other resorts!Service: very good. Everyone at the hotel (with the exception of one woman) was nice and as helpful as they could be. If you smile and make an effort to speak their language, they will do their best to help. I think it all depends upon your attitude. If you act as if you feel forunate to be in their beautiful country, they want to accomodate you. If you have an unpleasant attitude, they will probably have a less pleasant attitude in return. Just learn a few Spanish phrases and you're good to go.Food: decent, not great. We ate alot of chicken and fish, and the fruit (bananas, pineapple) was delicious. The rice and beans were always good as well. If you couldn't find something to eat at the buffet for dinner, there was always the cook-to-order pasta bar, which was pretty good. Wine was plentiful at dinner. Breakfast was good, with alot of good choices along the muffins/bakery breads/waffles/ pancakes lines. Omelettes were not bad. There was a lady making fresh fruit smoothies which were quite tasty. While you could always get a decent meal, snacks were hard to come by - I suggest you bring some along.We did go VIP, which I would recommend. We got an upstairs room near the beach. The free massages (we had ours outdoors near the pool - no appt. necessary) were great! We always got premium liquors. Internet service was at the lobby.Weight room: very nice - one of the best we've seen at any hotel! Bench press, free weights, universal machines, several cardio machines, ab benches, exercise balls, and great AC! Very clean, too.Trams: Helpful, but not essential if you're in decent shape. Usually readily available, though. You might have to wait 5 minutes or so for one. Ladies in any kind of heels may need to ride trams, esp. at night. The footing is a little uneven and the grounds are pretty dark. I just wore flat sandals, and I was fine.Excursions: Generally require long bus rides. We went snorkeling at the Marinarium. Very clean, nice facility and boat. Staff was excellent - very nice and alot of fun. The snorkeling was a bit of a disappointment. The reef was really beat up. Very little color, and not alot of fish. All in all, a fun boat ride, but not a great excursion.Other guests: The clientele is heavily European, so just remember that you'll be with very different cultures. Everyone was polite, and we never had a problem with noise or loud partying.Summary: The resort is lovely. We really enjoyed ourselves. Unless you have to have alot of adventure, I'd suggest hanging out at the resort and walking down the beach to flea markets if you want some extra local color. We didn't come here for the food. We came for relaxation and fun at a beautiful beach. We definitely got that.

<Content>worst vacation ever This was the first vacation i have ever gone on that i was happy to come home. If you are an American and don't speak fluent spanish you better stay home because you are ignored until all spanish speaking people are taken care of first. Just knowing a few phrases will not help you at all. I know that i was in their country and all that, and i tried to understand and speak what little i knew but it wasn't good enough. The second thing is after spending the day in the beautiful hot sun( near 90 everyday) and the near 100% humidity, i want to have dinner in a nice air conditioned resturant but they were all closed!!!!!! We had to eat at the buffet in an open air room where the sweat drips off your forehead into your plate. One resturant Licey was open but we could only get in there 1 night and it had a very linited menu. There is almost no nightly entertainment, and what they do have is in an open air room with no air conditioning. I will say the grounds were very well kept and the rooms were cleaned and taken care of, but the shower water pressure was very low. The beach was clean and the pool water was clear but the bottom was not vacuumed all week we were there. This is a very large resort and they have a tram that takes you from one end to the other. The problem is that it only holds about 10-12 people at a time and it's always packed and there were people who actually pushed you out of the way to get on ahead of you even if you were waiting before them.

<Content>paradise!!!!!!!!! my boyfriend and i traveled to punta cana in august, and stayed at the bavaro princess. this had been our very first trip outside of america and we are in our 30's. so we really didn't know what to expect. we knew we wanted to go somewhere tropical, and we had a budget. we told our travel agent (liberty travel) about how much we wanted to spend, and she suggested punta cana, so we researched it and i was surprised at all the negative reviews. we could not have had a more relaxing and wonderful time. the only problem we did have was with our travel agent, we are from PA. and she booked us on a connecting flight from philadelphia to charlotte,NC. when we got there we realized we could have had a direct. then she told us if we had any problems at all to call her collect and they would help us. not true. the airline lost our luggage, so here we are in a another country were not many people speak english and we have no luggage. so we checked in with a representative from american airlines, at the punta cana airport and he filed a claim. so we get our tour bus to our hotel, and we are so hungry and tired that the only thing i wanted to do was eat and go to sleep. we get to the hotel and the staff was so welcoming. they realized that we had no luggage but our carryons which thank goodness we packed swimsuits and an extra pair of chlothes. they asked what they could do to help, and by the way the front desk spoke excellent english, i told him i only wanted to sleep he asked me where i wanted my room, and since we were vip we get closest to the beach he gave us the best room.753 you walk on the balcony and the beach is right there, it was paradise. oh ya, that was another thing the travel agent did not tell us about vip we found it on our own research, and had to ask liberty about it. we paid $38 a person for the week and i can't tell you how worth it it was, we got massages by the pool and never had to wait in line for reservations, you deal with a vip conciergie the whole week. miguel was so helpful w/any question we had. the hotel took the luggage claim form from me to photo copy it and made phone calls for us to find our luggage they delivered it to us the next day. they were so wonderful. and the language barrier was not bad at all if someone did not speak english they would get you somebody who did. we realized that when we got our luggae that we overpacked anyway, your are on a tropical beach the only thing you really need is a swimsuit. since we were vip we got free room service, so most mornings we would get it, it was great. the food was great, you just have to be careful that's all, just don't overdo it and take some immodium,tums, pepto just in case. we were fine. it is just prepared different that's all. steak at el gaucho-great. and our dinner at licey was amazing and we didn't pay for any of it, we had a bottle of wine and thought ok, it will show up on our bill- nope free. we made friends with a couple on their honeymoon from philly and they we in the room next to us so that was fun. we also went on one excursions bavaro splash, you take a two person boat and follow a group out to a coral reef for snorkling it was so amazing. we had so much fun we are returning next year, the staff works so hard for pennies, it is a poor country but life down there is so relaxed compared to us, we should take a lesson from them.

<Content>Dream Wedding We got married  stayed at the hotel. The wedding was out of this world! There were only 6 of us, but the staff and other guests of the hotel shared in our day by greeting us and cheering when we had our first kiss... it was awesome! The staff were amazing... We didn't want for anything! The atmosphere was great... The weather was beautiful... The beach was spectacular! And the food... let's just say we ate like kings and queens! Loved it and plan to go back to celebrate one of our wedding anniversaries! Let's put it this way, when we came back home we wanted to pack up and move there! Truly and dream come true!!!

<Content>Fantastic resort We are 27  29 years old and this was our 6th trip to Punta Cana together. We have previously stayed at the RIUs, the Catalonia Bavaro, and the Punta Cana Princess. The Bavaro Princess ranks among the best of them in every respect. We purchased the VIP package and definitely felt it was well worth the money. Features included: in-room beach towels, nightly turn down service, concierge service, dinner at Licey ($25/US per person otherwise), 3 cigars and a small bottle of rum in your room, bathrobes, 20 min massage, internet time, use of motorized water sports, free room service, and premium brand drinks. VIP guests could also make all of their a la carte reservations at once by calling or visiting the VIP concierge located near the pool. The resort itself is huge (96 acres in total) and very developed in terms of vegetation. The greenery and foilage was just gorgeous and we were really impressed with the maturity of the grounds. There is a large section of mangroves in the middle of the resort - if you take the bridge through it, you'll also find bird aviary and iguana hut. We really enjoyed seeing the ducks, swans and peacocks freely roaming the grounds; they added to the natural feel of the resort. We were assigned room #714, 4 buildings in from the beach (about a minute's walk) The room was exactly as shown in the brochures. On the lower level, there was a table and chairs next to the coffee bar, dresser/desk, and a sitting area outfitted with rattan furnishings. The mini-fridge was inside the dresser and contained a large jug of water, an assortment of soft drinks and a few beers. Everything was replenished daily; bottled water was also available at lobby bar. The king sized bed was two steps up from the living area. The tv and another small dresser were also in the sleeping area. There were enough english channels on the tv to keep us entertained when necessary (CNN, a few movie channels, ESPN). The sink and washroom were just a few steps from the bedroom, with the toilet and shower in a separate room from the sink. Water pressure was not the greatest in the shower, but it got the job done. The air-conditioning, though a little loud, worked wonderfully, and there was a ceiling fan above the bed. Turning the a/c to low and leaving the ceiling fan on at night created the perfect temperature for sleeping. The maids are told to shut off your power when they clean the room, so they will pull your power card/room key out and leave it sitting on the power box. Not to worry - the room stays cool as long as your windows and doors are shut. The pool was large, free-form, and very tropical feeling with palms and a rock island in the centre. There were plenty of lounge chairs and palapas around the pool, and even a few secluded areas for those wanting a little privacy. The pool bar was open from 10-5 pm and offered every drink you would want on a caribbean vacation, all served with a smile. We were also able to get extra bottles of beer to take back to our room from the pool bar. The VIP package allowed us to get bottles of Heineken and MGD to take with us - a definite improvement over the beer in our room fridge. As gorgeous as the pool was, it was really hot and there was never a breeze, so we only spent one morning there; we were beach bums for the rest of our trip. The beach is the big reason why we keep returning to Punta Cana. Powder-fine white sand that goes on for miles in either direction, capped off by the most beautiful turquoise water...what more could you ask for? It鈥檚 just out of this world. The water was unusually rough for most of our trip - refreshing for a swim, but the currant was stronger than it鈥檚 been on our previous trips in September. As the resort was only at half capacity, we never had trouble finding a lounge chair at the beach or pool at all during our stay. The palapas on the beach were always occupied but you could usually find a shady spot under a palm tree. There are two beach bars at the BP, but only one was in use during our stay. It was open from 10-5 pm; service was always fast and friendly. Presidente, mixed drinks, water and soft drinks were available. Be sure to try a guypareena (definitely spelled wrong, but that鈥檚 how you pronounce it), made with crushed limes, sugar, limeade and gin. Daytime activities were held on the beach in the mornings (aerobics, volleyball) and at the pool in the afternoons (ping-pong competitions, shuffleboard, water aerobics, swim contests). All of the evening entertainment was held at the front of the resort in the courtyard/theatre area. On Saturday night there was a pianist and singer by the main bar in the lobby - they were very good and performed for well over an hour. We only made an effort to catch one show: the Studio 54 dance production, held on Wednesday night. This show is a must-see - in all our trips to Punta Cana, this was the best show I have ever watched. Very high energy, excellent choreography performed by a talented bunch of dancers - it was fantastic. We also heard excellent things about the Lion King show on Friday night. Otherwise, most of the shows were audience-participation type shows, typical of what you find in most AI resorts. The resort also has a disco on-site, and a casino just outside the entrance. We never made it to either so I can鈥檛 say much about them, although one couple we met told us they were in the casino twice near midnight and it was pretty much empty. I assume this had more to do with it being the off-season rather than the casino itself. All of the staff was helpful and friendly, always willing to share a smile and an 鈥榟ola鈥? Our room was kept very clean, and our maid even went to the trouble of straightening up our shoes and folding up our swimwear that we usually hung in the shower to dry! We were more than happy to tip at this resort, and I strongly encourage anyone who can afford to take an all-inclusive vacation to the Caribbean to do the same. A dollar or two goes a long way here, and if it can make someone鈥檚 day, why not share a little? The service we received was exemplary considering the number of guests these people interact with on a daily basis - the staff does an excellent job of keeping their guests happy.The resort has 2 or 3 shops souvenir shops and a jewellery store in the lobby. Prices are set in stone in these shops, so if you absolutely hate to haggle (like me), this is the place for you. We purchased 2 pounds of coffee, a few postcards and a key-chain for $15 US. Beach vendors are set up on either end of the beach, about a 20 minute walk to both the left and right of the BP. You will have to haggle with them for a good price, but for some people that鈥檚 half the fun. There is also a strip mall and shopping area right outside the entrance to the resort, and the Bavaro Plaza shopping area is just down the street. The resort does allow vendors to set up shop in the courtyard on Thursday nights (Dominican nights), and they had a large selection of artwork, jewellery and sculptures. The food at the main buffet, Hispaniola, was wonderful. The building is open on 3 sides and it was always very warm in there, even with ceiling fans going. Fortunately for the men, long pants were not required at any meal here. For breakfast, they had awesome made-to-order omelettes each morning, or you could have eggs made to your liking. The buffet included the usual scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, fruits and a huge selection of breads and muffins. We did see some unusual items, such as beans in sauce and broiled tomatoes, at breakfast; there was definitely something for everyone! Dinner was served from 6:30-10 pm. We only dined here twice at night - Saturday was a seafood theme, and Thursday was Dominican night. The actual buffet didn鈥檛 vary much - rice, potatoes, cooked vegetables, salad bar - but there were always specialty stations preparing dishes according to the theme for the evening. For the seafood night, they offered grilled shrimp, lobster tail and all kinds of fish; on Dominican night we had rice and beans, suckling pig and roast chicken. Desserts usually included a few kinds of cookies, 2 or 3 flavours of ice cream, and a few custards and cakes. We tried 3 of the a la cartes - I highly recommend each of them. Licey - I ordered the beef in mushroom sauce as my entree and was not disappointed; it was delicious. I also had salad with sliced turkey and shrimp rolls for my appetizers. My boyfriend ordered portobello mushrooms with escargot, and cod and salmon rolls for appetizers, and enjoyed the lamb for his main course. We did not order dessert, but our waiter brought us Baileys with coffee which was a nice treat after our meal. We had the house red wine with dinner. It was drinkable - better than I expected, anyway. Imported wines were available for $30 US (and up). Licey had a lovely, intimate environment with excellent service - the waiters were really on top of their game and were eager to make sure we had a nice time. That said, I probably would not have paid the $25 US per person to dine here if it wasn鈥檛 included in the VIP package. We enjoyed ourselves, but I didn鈥檛 feel the restaurant was special enough to warrant the extra cost Sakura - This was our favourite a la carte and we were disappointed that we could only go once (it was not open on the other night we wanted to go). We are big sushi fans so we were excited to try their sushi appetizer buffet. It was wonderful and I think we both would have been more than happy to just eat sushi for dinner. After stuffing ourselves with sushi, our entrees arrived - king prawn with pork for my boyfriend, and noodles with chicken and pork for me. Both were delicious, and huge portions too. Once again, we finished up our meal with Baileys and coffee. The ambiance was very nice - the restaurant was decorated with Oriental artwork, and some of the staff were dressed in Japanese style jackets. My only disappointment was that we didn鈥檛 get to dine in the regular Sakura restaurant. Since the resort was only half full, the usual Sakura and Chopin restaurants were closed and moved into the other half of the Hispaniola buffet. As such, the restaurant was not air conditioned and we were very warm while we dined (they had ceiling fans going, but in an open air restaurant they didn鈥檛 help much). Otherwise, we loved this restaurant and highly recommend it.Bella Pasta - We enjoyed this a la carte (especially since it was enclosed and therefore cooler than the others!) and had a wonderful time dining here with some friends we met. The restaurant offered 4 individual sized pizzas on the menu, so we each ordered a different one and shared with the table. I had spaghetti with olive oil and garlic as my entree (very good), and the others ordered chicken marsala (more like chicken parmesan than marsala) and veal with cheese. The veal was absolutely huge and two of us probably could have shared that meal and still had leftovers! For dessert we had tiramisu and fruit. All in all, we enjoyed our food and left stuffed and happy. McPrincess  El Gaucho (open for lunch at the beach): McPrincess was the place to go for hamburgers, hotdogs, and grilled ham  cheese sandwiches in the afternoons. Ask for the packets of Heinz mustard behind the counter - the stuff on the counter reminded me of a runny Dijon. El Gaucho was open from noon until about 4 pm for lunch and had a fantastic selection of foods for lunch. Offering roast chicken, beef, pork chops, fries, rice, pizza, a salad bar and a make-it-yourself pasta bar with 4 different pastas and sauces to mix and match, this was definitely our favourite spot for lunch. I suggest sitting on the patio if you can - you鈥檒l enjoy a wonderful breeze off the ocean. Room Service was included free of charge with our VIP package and very good. We took advantage of it once for breakfast and once for dinner. For breakfast we ordered a ham and cheese omelette and fried eggs with sausage. Our meal arrived with a full carafe of coffee and milk, real orange juice, and a basket full of muffins and croissants. For dinner we chose the hamburger with fries and the grilled fillet along with a small pizza and a bottle of champagne. Sandwiches, pastas and desserts were also available via room service. We really enjoyed having this option available to us - it was a nice way to enjoy a quiet, relaxed meal. Miscellaneous Stuff: At check-in, you receive 2 room keys - one to keep with you and one to activate the power in your room. Any card with a magnetic strip will work to keep the power on, so if you need to bring both keys with you, just pop a card from home (ideally, one that you don鈥檛 mind losing, just in case - I used my MM meats card) and it will work fine. There were timeshare reps from Royal Holidays in the resort - avoid them at all costs! They will tell you anything just to get you into the presentation, but once you鈥檙e in there, you鈥檙e stuck (one couple we met was kept for 2 hours in an un-airconditioned room). The hotel must have a deal with this company because there were also Royal Holidays advertisements in the rooms. Internet access was available in the lobby for a cost of $8 US for 1 hour, $3 for 15 minutes, and probably $5-6 for 30 minutes. We each had an hour of internet time included in our VIP package - the only downfall is that each person has to use all their time at once, so even if you only use the internet for 5 minutes, your free time is used up. Washrooms are located across from the photo stand, near the tram stop, in the lobby, and at the side and back of the El Gaucho building on the beach. Bring any and all toiletries and medications you think you will need. Small bottles of sunscreen were available in the gift shop starting at $16 US, so you are better off to bring lots from home (we always bring the sport formulas which are waterproof and sweatproof - they last longer in the salt water). Chips and snacks were available in the gift shop starting around $4 US, so bringing those from home is also a wise idea. Definitely use common sense when eating and drinking in the resort. Do not ingest the tap water (this means keeping your mouth shut in the shower too), and try not to go too crazy at the buffets and the bars for your first few days. The food is not prepared the same as at home, and you probably aren鈥檛 used to drinking from 9 a.m. on, so it will catch up with you. Immodium and Pepto are definitely good things to throw in your bag, just in case. Remember to drink water during the day too - our tour rep made a point of telling us that we wouldn鈥檛 feel thirsty because of the high level of humidity, so dehydration can sneak up on you quickly (extreme fatigue and feeling crampy later in the day are signs of dehydration). If you use common sense and practice good hygiene (wash your hands!), you鈥檒l be fine.To sum up, we loved the Bavaro Princess and have been very impressed with the Princess chain in general. We had a few minor disappointments along the way, but nothing that was big enough to derail our fun. Feel free to email me at ginnyfyris@yahoo.ca I鈥檓 happy to answer questions and share my photos with anyone who is interested.

<Content>Great Vacation My husband and I were at the Bavaro Princess for our 25th Anniversary and I must say the place is amazing. SUITE: It was kept very clean. My only complaint was our shower had no pressure. FOOD: Anything you want to eat. 6 al la carte restaurants with 2 buffets. One buffet in the front of the resort and one at the beach. Which I must say, eating lunch and having a perfect view of the ocean, is a dream come ture. We had no complaints about the food, everything tasted great. Also, you had all the drinks that your heart desired. Alchoholic or non-alchoholic. Also wine with lunch and dinner. Food and drinks everywhere!!!NIGHTLY SHOWS: The employees put in long hours working all day long and also practice to put on the evening shows for the guests. I thought they did a great job. BEACH: AMAZING!!!!POOL: AMAZING!!!RESORT: It was very well maintained. Those poor gardeners working in that stiffling heat, cutting grass and keeping those grounds looking beautiful. It is a large resort, but we walked to where we wanted to go, that way we got in our daily exersise. EMPLOYEES: Everyone was very friendly, ola was said everytime we past an employee. The service was also good in all the restaurants we went to. I would recommend the Bavaro Princess to anyone wanting to experience a great vacation.

<Content>The Best Time We Ever Had My boyfriend and I went to the Bavaro Princess and had the best time of our lives.We stayed from August 26 to September 2,2005.We thought it was so wonderful. We were a little scared about going because of the reviews we read but I am so happy we went. A lot of people say that the service is not so great but we thought it was excellent.I have never met such nice, hardworking people before. They were really great, You become friend with them.We both speak English and yes it was a little hard to understand them but they tried as best as they could to help you with what you needed.The rooms were beautiful and the balcony was great.The food was the only thing that I would have to say wasn't that great. But you got to figure you are in another country and of course the food is going to taste different. Also we only ate at the buffett in the lobby and the snack bar for lunch because my boyfriend didn't bring jeans and you couldn't eat anywhere else unless you had pants. So we were limited to what we could eat so from what we had it was ok. I think that this is a great place to go on vacation. The pools, beach, entertainment at night, everthing was great. We would definatly reccomend the Bavaro Princess and We would definatly go back .

<Content>Princess - More like a queen !!! I had the same view as the last person, and was very apprehensive about going there.It turned out to be the best holiday that we have ever had.(Countries that we have visited - Egypt, Israel, America, Sicily, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Greece etc, so we are seasoned travellers!) The staff are friendly (try to speak a little Spanish - it will get you a long way).The selection of food is amazing, and although we did not try the oriental or the fish restaurants, the standards everywhere else were very high.Room cleaned, bed linen and towels changed every day. Maid very happy and friendly. All workers including the gardeners were lovely.The pool was clean. (Maybe the complainers got up too late to see the pool and attendants cleaning it every morning!)You can change your beach towels as many times as you like.The ground are beautiful and we found Flamingoes, Geese, many other species of exotic birds live in the grounds.There are also turtles, fish, and parrots amongst the most beautiful settings.The mini bar was replenished every day, drinks freely available everywhere.The beach is beautiful and Gaucho is nearby if you want a late breakfast, lunch or dinner near to the sea.Whoever goes, we hope that you have as good a holiday as we didBravo Bavaro.We will return.

<Content>Best vacation ever We went as a family my husband and my 2 year old daughter. We were a bit inconvenienced with getting our room right away. We arrived at the hotel 12:30pm and we were only able to check in at 3:00pm. Other than that, we were serviced very well. Our room was beautiful and very clean. The water was filter even the ice cubes. Basically, no one got sick. Regarding the food, we all know it's nothing like here (Montreal), but it was passable. The best restaurant was Bella Pasta. Nightly shows were great and was also catered to children. The resort is very big, so if you don't like walking this is not the resort for you. They do have a train that passes every so often to take you to your destination which was fun. In short, this was our best vacation ever.

<Content>What a Heavenly Place!! Dear All, So I just came back (Sep 10 to Sep 17) from Punta Cana, we stayed at Bavaro Princess. I have to say that we had a wonderful time. No words can explain how magnificent the hotel is. We travel every year to ether an all inclusive resorts on we go cruising. I have to say that our stay at Bavaro Princess was the most amazing of them all. I only have one question to all those guests who wrote negative comments about the hotel 鈥淎re you guys sure you are not mistaken it for another hotel?鈥?br/>With all the respect to each and individual comment, but I found that none of those comments were true. Again, every person expectation is different but not to that extent.I almost cancelled my trip from all the negative comments I read, especially when traveling with 2 young kids.Food: Was beyond the word excellent. There were Lots of variety and it was always fresh and tasty. The A la carte restaurants were very good too.Hotel: Oh Gosh, beautiful hotel very exotic and tropical, and those of you traveling with kids they would love the mini Zoo, which by the way is not mini at all. The shuttle service to take you and from the pool was fast and frequent.Service: Well, that was my only concern. Some of the staff are not the friendliest people ever, I don鈥檛 know if that is b/c the language barrier, for I found that some of the them lacked the basic English language like 鈥淐an I have a diet Pepsi with no ice, please鈥? I know that I am the one traveling to their country, so they don鈥檛 have to learn my language. Comparing to Mexico for example they all speak conversational English at least, but I know that I can鈥檛 compare Mexico to the Dominican for Mexico has been in the travel industry for much longer.Activities: What an effort these people put into these shows, I was 300% satisfied with the activities and games they provided. The thing that impressed me the most was the fact that they involved my kids in their Shows. On our last day they did a Lion King Show and Oh man was it ever good. The activity team started their activities from 9:00 am to 1:00 am! What an effort.Rooms: Supper clean and a nice European style bathrooms. The set-up of the room was excellent the King bed was on a rise with Roman columns you go 2 steps down to a living area with double bed, T.V ,mini fridge and walk out to the balcony. Bathroom @ the beach: I had to right about the bathroom at the beach, they were so sparkling and so clean, I couldn鈥檛 believe that this was the beach bathroom. The floors the walls were all marble and spotless, wow. Kids Club: Good programs and they keep them very busy. Our kids didn鈥檛 want to stay with us they wanted to go there first thing in the morning.V.I.P Package: We upgraded our pkg to V.I.P, it was worth it for my husband for he got 2 dives and the massage at the beach was well worth it too. I truly believe this hotel is beyond 5*, and I recommend it to everyone.

<Content>simply Amazing Went with 6 early twenty year old girlfriends (sep3-sep10) and had an amazing time. resort was wonderful! we were upgraded to VIP service and found it very worthwhile. massages, room service, motorized water sports and VIP concierge service was great!!! the grounds is not really meant for party girls such as ourselves, but the staff was very helpful in telling us where we could have a good time, (Mangu located at Gran Flamenco around 2 minute drive from bavaro princess). Trolly service was available at all hours and very useful since the resort is so big. Favourite dinner was at the steak house, favourite lunch was at the buffet located near the beach, chicken and bbq was fantastic. Rooms were also very nice, clean, big and well maintained. Staff even though most did not speak english very well, was very kind and helpful.I would recommend this resort to people of all ages. We had the oppurtunity to relax, meet new friends from all over the world, lounge out on the very nice white sand beach and still find a good party at night.

<Content>simply paradise Hotel was beautiful as well as the grounds. Well maintained. Lots of activities for the children. Service at the beach bar excellent. Food was okay . Reservations are necessary and men must wear pants. Service at the restaurants were adaequate except for Asian restaurant. Waited 1/2 hour for the kids soda and wine was not brought either. El Pescador ( seafood )was really great and service was excellent .Maid service was great and rooms were clean before lunch every day. Tipping is not necessary but certainly appreciated and means a lot. For the most part everyone speaks English and really tries, but it was good to learn some Spanish. Snorkelling with the nurse sharks excursion was great. Highly recommend it. If interested in cigars kindly let the concierg know and he will send a car to bring you to a cigar factory. Most enjoyable. All in all I highly recommend this place and would return in the future.

<Content>Hotel okay but doesn't warrant a return visit My wife and I spent a week at this resort in Feb.05. The hotel itself was pleasant. We had a VIP package which allowed us (I presume) to have a suite with an ocean view and the room itself was very clean and well decorated. The grounds were well kept and the common areas were well appointed. The staff was most pleasant especially the people in the beachside restuarant.Our biggest complaint was the food in the buffet area. We tried the Chinese buffet the first night and it was truly disgusting. We could not believe how bad it was. The next morning we went to the buffet again and could not again believe how awful the food was. From then on we confined ourselves to breakfast and lunch at the beachside hut which was always satisfactory. In the evening they turn this hut into a seafood restaurant and it too was always enjoyable. Il Pescador and the steakhouse were also good.We found that the staff at the lobby bar at night would avoid the english speaking crowd in favour of the spanish speaking clientele. this was not impressive and when the a waiter tried to sell me grass I was not impressed either. ( When in Rome??)Another thing that drove us nuts was that Kenny G was piped throughout the grounds daily , ad nauseum. You couldn't walk anywhere without hearing that dreadful music. and to boot, Christmas Carols by Kenny in Feb.The music in the beachside hut was Dominican , salsa, merengue etc and it was fun to listen to., that should have been piped through the sound system.We had stayed at the RIU Taino down the beach and this Princess didn't hold a candle to it in any shape or form. Everyone has different tastes and this just didn't suit us; we would not return to a Princess

<Content>want to lose weight, bad food with some bad attitudes We stayed at the Bavaro Princess for 4 days and 3 nights and overall, the place was beautiful and the beach on the resort was lovely, but the costumer service and food was very poor. The resort and country was not catered to the Americans at all, so it was an expereince and our group were the only Americans there on the resort at the time. Alot of French and Spainish tourist which was okay, but we could not get good help from anyone (even the employees, which sometimes they seemed to be rude ) because they did not know much english. THE FOOD,,,, very different and untasteful. When you go on a vacation and you are staying on a resort, you exspect to eat and gain some wait, we lost wait. The food was very blaned or too sweet to even enjoy.But overall, we had fun and their shows were nice. We shopped out of the resort and we felt like we were in New York husling bargins but we ended up with the better deals out the resort than in.

<Content>Why all the complaints, we loved it !! I Stayed at the Bavaro Princess in March and still occasionally read the reviews and I am amazed at how many people complain about everything, food, language etc. You are in another country and a 3rd world country at that, what do you want? Most of the people speak enough English to get by and try to help you with whatever it is that you want. I agree I didnt care for the food all that much as I am a picky eater anyway, but I didnt starve. The rooms were exceptionally clean and nice, the staff was great in helping us with what we needed, Ruben, the bartender at the pool, was outstanding, look him up if you should get there. The resort is big and we knew that, but we always enjoyed the walks as the grounds were beautiful and well kept and we always got an Hola from everyone we met along the way. The beach was very clean and water crystal clear that alone was a plus for us after swimming in the beaches back home. When you go to another country you must expect differences, so if that is the problem limit your vacations to your own country

<Content>Our second time around We visit The Bavaro Princess Hotel for the second time around, first time we went last April for our honeymoon, we liked it so much and had a wonderful time, that's why we wanted to go back again before the summer was over. The people are so friendly  humble, and they do whatever is possible to make your stay there pleasant and unforgetable. Both visits we had a VIP package with accomocations near the pool. The suites are very comfortable, decorated with a tropical accent. They consisted of a living room area, a dinning room, bedroom and bathroom with a confortable vanity area and a walk-in closed. Our suite was cleaned daily, towels service was twice a day and the pool towels were changed also. I ask for a blanket when we arrived and before the night I had three blankets and extra linen. The VIP concierge worked exellent for us in regards to reservations and answered any questions that we had. Just a little tip can improve your service to the maximum, this is like in any other place around the world. Drinks and food were plenty to suite every taste. The Hispaniola buffet for lunch and breakfast, excellent!! A minimum of two fish plates to choose from, different kinds of meats, vegetables, pastas, fruits and delicious desserts and breads. The buffets close to the beach were ok for breakfast and lunch if you didn't want to walk to the main building and preferred to stay close to the beach. Hamburgers were delicious in the hut close to the beach with fries. We visited this time The Gaucho and The Pescador with reservations, the food was good but since we been there before we realize that reservations was tighting us down with the clock and preferred buffets most of the week.The grounds are well kept and extremelly clean. The beach is gorgeous and the pool was good. Night entertainment was also pleasant with some good variety shows and piano bar in main lobby. Night time is nice and the dress code at night is casual, but men were slacks and we women can were nice summer/cocktail dresses. This is customary in caribbean countries (remember they are used to the heat) But and this is a BIG BUT August is too hot to visit the caribbean. The heat was sometimes unbearable for me especially if you want to walk after lunch or lay down at the beach, you had to think twice before getting out of your air conditioning room from 12N to 4:00 PM. We had some stomach disconfort and I believe it was due to the heat and eating more than what we usually eat. But in general it was a very nice week.

<Content>Bavaro is a nice resort My boyfriend and I just came back Monday from DR...I loved the resort and the people...I will agree with another comment about it not really being for Americans...Its a nice island and resort, but my Spanish isnt that good...But I do believe that the people at the resort tried their hardest to figure out what I was saying sometimes and vice versa...I mean it is a Spanish speaking country, so what more can u expect. And if they didnt know what u were saying, they would ask someone to translate and vice versa. The rooms were beautiful and the food ok...I mean if u want American food, then u need to stay in America. I loved the entertainment and my boyfriend and I even participated in the pool side salsa lesson. The beach was excellent and the people were nice...The Asian resturant Sakura wasnt all that, but the rest of the restaurants were nice. We met some really great people there from New Jersey, New York and Russia. I really dont see the point in getting the VIP package b/c it seems to u get the samething as everyone else. What u would consider top shelf liquor in America like Remy Martin Cognac they dont have. Top shelf is what they consider top shelf in the DR. And 20mins for a massage just wouldnt do it for me. Stay with the regular package and enjoy yourself.We were intially going to La Romana to the Santana Beach and Resort, but after reading all the comments, we switched to this resort. Overall, I was happy with resort.

<Content>Terrible food and service I want you all to know that I am a seasoned traveler. My husband and I travel a minimum of 2 times a year. We've stayed at small hotels, as well as, 5-star hotels. In the 17 years that we've been traveling alone or with our children we have never had such a horrible experience.We should have known that our trip was doomed when our initial greeting at the airport was the rudest women when we were buying our tourist cards. I speak spanish fluently, but I felt terrible for those who had no clue what to do with these cards. I was confused and when we asked her questions she ignored us and was only interested in collecting her $10 per person, then you were on your own. I traveled with some friends who were born and raised in DR and she treated them even worse.The minute you get your bags men are scrambling for your luggage. They don't even give you a chance to take inventory. You have to find someone who can tell you what bus you should take to your resort, but these guys are practically running way with your bags. In this mass of confusion you could easily be robbed, so guard your possessions.Once we made it to our hotel you had to stand on line to check in. Not so bad, but they were not informative about your room location at all. We happened to get into the hotel at 9:30pm, we all scrambled to get a bite to eat. The only thing available was the Hispanola. I should mention that they opened at 6:30pm and it is unbearably hot and the food had been sitting around for hours and everything was dry and over cooked. We hoped it would get better.We then claimed our luggage and you have to get on these trams (more like large golf carts-2 linked together-maximum capacity 18 passengers). The resort is very large and pretty but the windes alot, so if you decide to walk anywhere, I hope you have comfy shoes because there is no straight-away and it can take 15-20 minutes to get to the main lobby (all night entertainment and shops are there). Anyway, the guy who took us to our room was very nice. He walked us to our room and carryied some our stuff in.The room itself was extremely comfortable. Livingroom area, with dining table, the bed was in a raised room with a king size bed. My 12 year old got a twin size bed which fit in a nice corner near the bar area. Relatively separate and private for her. The dressing/closet area was also comfortable, as was the bathroom (which had a bidet). We had an ironing board, steam iron and hair drier-all worked fine). The woman who cleaned our room daily was very nice and very accomodating, as was the night person who did the turn down service. They did not replenish the fridge daily and they did not replenish our beach towels. We had to remind them or get our towels from the pool area. Often they were gone by 9am and people would reserve the palapa huts on the beach and by the pool and then disappear for hours while they went on excursions or God knows what else. You had to get up at the crack of dawn to not be left frying in the sun all day.We had a VIP status which had some perks, but must say that it didn't compensate for the overal bad service that the resort had to offer. VIP gave us a room near the beach and large pool (that was a good thing because when you get sick from the food you must be able to make a mad-dash to the bathroom). As VIP, we had bathrobes, a free bottle of rum (a pint of their worst liquor), 3 cigars (we couldn't stand the constant smoking of the other guests-many Euros with no manners-they huffed and puffed in your face AND your childrens'), a 20 minute massage (2 per room), 1 hour on the internet, 1 hour of a water sport (snorkling). I took advantage of the spa treatment-I combined the two and got a 40 minute massage (I get massages often-never has anyone massaged my stomach-where the heck did they get their training????-It wasn't very good). You were also given a free dinner at their gourmet restaurant (Licey). We were also supposed to get top shelf alcohol in our drinks-good luck finding it ( you can't even find real orange juice!)- the point is that if you're thinking about paying additional for a VIP status-don't bother it isn't worth the extra money. OH, I almost forgot!! You get your own VIP concierge...what a joke. They are totally useless. My husband is a golfer and had every intention of going out to play. Most hotels will make phone calls, arrange tee times and transportation. Guess what?? NOT AT BAVARO PRINCESS!!!Overall the grounds were kept beautifully and the beach was nice. They had a pool bar, but if you're expecting someone to come to you on the beach or at the pool and ask if they can take your order-FORGET IT!! THIS IS NOT THAT KIND OF RESORT.The entertainment staff worked very hard to keep everyone busy at the pool and put on interesting productions in the evening. They even put on a version of The Lion King with the children from the kids camp. It was very cute. These guys roughed it out there in the heat by the pool and under the stage lights. They did a good job.NOW THE FOOD/RESTAURANTS...Depending on your frame of mind what I am about to tell may not be an issue. If you like to be a free spirit and not dress up to dine or have to make reservations, again, this hotel is not for you. The general rule was if you make a reservation, men HAD to wear slacks. At their gourmet restaurant they required slacks and a jacket (NOT the best attire when it's 105 degrees with 500% humidity-well that's how it felt anyway!!). You MUST make reservations if you want to try all the restaurants in the resort. The problem is you can only reserve one day in advance and by 10 am 3 of the 7 were fully booked. Well those that were fully booked were not even 1/2 full each evening. We experienced this in two of the restaurants. I traveled with friends so all together we had a party of 15. Somehow I ended up with the terrible task of making reservations. Not only did they lie about the availability, but then they would not allow me to reserve a table for 15. They only allowed 8-10 per reservation. Some of the food was tasty. The Chopin had very good food, but it was buffet style. We got there when they opened so everything was fresh. It was so hot that no matter what you got to drink, everything was warm and the ice melted in seconds. This is a bad thing because if you're looking to drink a nice soda you start out with syrup water (no carbonation) and then the ice melts. Not good at all. (OK-I admit I'm a Pepsi addict-the first step is admitting you have a problem). The reservation dinners were not very good and they rushed you to finish so they could be prepared for their next seating. There are only two restaurants open for breakfast...El Gaucho and La Hispanola. La Hispanola offered more, but for us that ment getting up early to get ready, catch the tram and treck all the way to the other side of the resort. Alot of fun when you have a one year old, stroller and the other rude guests to contend with. Anyone ever try to fight their way onto a NYC train during rush hour?? (folks-this is just a visual, but very close to the fact). One woman tried to climb over me to grab a seat on the other side then proceeded to insult the people who got on on the right side of the tram. Another pushed my 12 year old daughter out of the way to get on, and never mind that we were waiting there patiently before anyone else. They didn't care. If they could run faster than you they got the seat no matter when they showed up. Often they won because we had the stroller, baby and baby bag. OK, so I strayed a little bit-perhaps I'm a little bitter about this whole trip.Our last day we were required to sign out by 12. If your flight leaves late they will gladly give you another 3 hours for an extra $40. They will gladly give you a courtesy room to shower and change (but you have to be willing to use the rooms they offer their construction workers. A room with construction debris all over the floor, no shower curtain, wet floors, dirty towels everywhere and bugs on the bed)-maybe you should wait and bathe at home. Our flight was delayed from 8:30 pm to 2 am. The hotel would not accommodate us (even with a one year old). The heat index was brutal, we'd been out of our room since 9:30 (trying to make breakfast) and there was no place to go to get relief from the heat. Everything there was open air. NO AC!!! (BY THE WAY-there's no a/c in most of the restaurants-only 3 had AC-including the gourmet restaurant). Our reservations were made thru Apple Vacations. They were even less helpful that the hotel. They claim that IF your flight was delayed 6 hours they would offer you a 3 minute courtesy call. No room or anything else!! BRING YOUR LAWYER'S NUMBER. It's like being in jail you get one call. Make it a good one...and quick!!End result of all this-12 of the 15 in my party got violently sick to their stomachs, my husband and kids got inner and outer ear infections from the pool water. I may have it too, but I've been stubborn about seeing a doctor. Be careful in your selections. One of the girls in my party goes to Punta Cana every year. She normally stays at Sunscape (alot smaller), but the service is 100% better and she NEVER got sick there. If you want to go to Punta Cana, make sure you speak to people who've been there and ask many questions. GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL IN YOUR TRAVELS.

<Content>Loved Princess Bavaro, but it is not for Americans Just got back yesterday from Princess Bavaro hotel in Punta Cana and I can tell you that the hotel is beautiful!!!. The rooms are big and the hotel its self is clean. However, there are some thing that especialy Americans should know about before picking a resort in Punta Cana:1.- The food that Bavaro Princess served is hardly latin food. Since the mayority of vacationers are from Spain, Portugal, Canadian and Argentinian to name a few, most of the food is guided toards them. Now, I am not by any means saying that the food is bad, the food is very well prepared but I did not like most of their food because I am not use to eating European style food.2.- People that are cleaning your rooms and serving your food are always with a smile on their faces and are always polite to everybody and should always be tiped well. (These people work twelve hour days, dont get paid over-time and only get paid about $200 USD A MONTH!!!).3.- Don't trust anybody outside of the hotel. As soon as they see the hotel ristband they try and charge you the highest price in the word. I know that that is what they do but come-on, $22 USD for a raw hamburger with fries? This happened to me, the bill that the hamburger place was for 200 Dominican Pesos and they charged me $22 USD. The good thing is that i was complaining to one of the vendors about the price of the hamburger when a tourist police passing by heard my conversation, he asked me if I had a problem, and I told him what had happened to me. He immediately went to the hamburger joint and asked to see my bill;Even the cop was amazed at how much they were charging me.To make this story shorter, I got my money back. I ended up paying $7 USD. In conclusion, If you are an American planning on going to the Dominican Republic, Think it twice please. I am not in any way saying don't go, it is a very beautiful country, most people are nice, but, there is not a lot of places to go like in Mexico, where you can take a bus and you are at the shopping mall in 10 min. In the Dom. Rep., the closest town from any resort is an hour away. I hope that this is usefull to everybody.In no way do I mean any disrespect to anybody, and if anybody fells disrespected, I apoligize from the bottom of my heart.

<Content>Resort wonderful but food and service not the best My husband, daughter and I spent July 25th to August 1st at this resort- The grounds were very nice but the area in the resort known as the Mangrove does have a smell - it can be strong some days - you would not want to have a room close to this area - we were very fortunate to have been booked into building 74 which is right by the beach - we had rooms 741 and 742 - our rooms were kept very clean and were quite large - the food was not the best but there was variety to be able to find something to eat and not go hungry - watch out for the hamburgers at that Mac Princess - the first time we tired them they were raw inside and did not try them again - I would like to say that there was one lady, Marlon, who worked in La Gaucho by the beach in the morning and La Copin in the evening that was very friendly - she helped make our vacation very enjoyable as she went out of her way to make us feel welcome - the beach - what can I say - most of the reviews say it is the most beautiful one they have seen and they are not exagerating - tipping does help but not always

<Content>Worst Vacation Ever My room safe was robbed by an employee. All of my cash was stolen, I had nothing left for gifts for my family. When I called hotel security they sent me a security guard that did not speak english! When someone finally showed up that understood english, I was told right off the bat the hotel was not responsible. I was treated like I did something wrong. I never usually put things in the safe but for some reason this trip I did. As for the staff they said they would do an investigation of the people who were in my room, the maid and the 2 maintenance men that came in to fix the leak in my ceiling. I was not offered anything for my loss, not even an apology from hotel management. The next day I went to the front desk to see if the investigation turned up anything, no one there knew what I was talking about. It was like it didn't even happen. Needless to say my trip was ruined! I urge you, if you are thinking about staying at this resort find somewhere else. Another thing was the food, the only restaurant with exceptional food was the one that was not included in the all inclusive package. I will never return to the Dominican Republic!!!

<Content>Loved the Bavaro Princess We just got back from spending a week at the Bavaro Princess and we had a wonderful time. If I had listened to all these negative reviews, I would have missed a week that we will always remember with great pleasure. The grounds are immaculate and beautiful - the people who work there, the maids, the groundskeepers, the wait staff, the bartenders, the chefs, everyone was pleasant and accomodating. I do not speak spanish but I managed to communicate with no trouble at all. My husband is fluent but I was treated no differently than he was. The rooms are very nice - the extra beds are a little less comfy than the ones that are in the actual bedroom area but my daughters were fine with it. The people that run the activites are energetic and made sure everyone had a great time. The only complaint that I could even come up with has nothing to do with the resort itself rather the unfriendliness and rudeness of some of the guests that are there - it is sad to see people behave so badly to the employees - that is all I will say. It is a tropical island so it is hot in the summer - that is to be expected - you are in the Dominican Republic - they do NOT speak english as a first language - people should understand and try to understand rather than to criticize - the food was good - not great but good - but this is an all inclusive - what do you expect??? And it is a huge resort - they do a very good job all things considered.Leaving tips was extremely appreciated - I dont understand how some people could get up and leave nothing - you would NEVER do that at a restaurant at home - it would be unheard of - we left our maid a little trinket along with a daily tip for which she thanked us profusely - these people do not make a lot of money and any little gesture is greatly appreciated.The restaurants are not stifling even though there is no air conditioning in most of the restaurants - we were very comfortable - again, this is a tropical island in the middle of the summer - heat is to be expected.Hot water was plentiful - the rooms did not smell - there were not a million bugs - as a matter of fact, I saw no mosquitos - and we went outside the resort to the shopping area called Bavaro Plaza and had a great time - the people love to haggle and MUST get you into their stores - here is a tip for you if you decide to go - be the first customer of the day in their store and you will get bargains galore - they consider the first sale of the day to be a blessing and will not want to lose it - it sets the tone of the day as far as they are concerned. The shows they put on at night were very cute - they work very hard and you have to give them credit for this - its not Broadway but it was nice to see on a nightly basis.I hope I covered it all - bottom line - go to the Bavaro Princess and have a great time - forget these negative reviews - if you need any more specific information, feel free to email me at dperez8541@aol.com and I will be more than happy to let you know whatever I can.

<Content>ripped off at the princess Just wanted to warn people not to buy the vip upgrade at the Bavaro Princess in Punta Cana. For the extra money that we paid all we got was a massage and complimentary use of a robe for a week. There was not any special service given to us. In fact many times the ones wearing the regular bands got better service than we did. We were tipping the bartenders also and we still got lousy service. This property is beautiful and the accomadations were ok but the food was adequate at best and as I said the service left much to be desired.

<Content>5 Star? Location Yes.... Food No! My wife and I just returned from 1 week at the Bavaro Princess and would like to share our observations.RECEPTION : Spanish is really a must if you want to have your requests understood and acted on. I must admit that while I was able to upgrade to a beautiful Ocean front room (744) and upgrade to VIP status (more later) I was totally in the dark about Hotel services, restaurants, tram service etc. My 1st hour at this property was a bit of a muddle to say the least.ROOM : #744 Oceanfront 2nd floor (premium price). Very large and clean at 1st appearance. Bathroom is a little outdated and kind of an odd layout but when you realize that the Hotel itself is almost 20 years old not suprising. Balcony was large and perfect for enjoy the Ocean Breezes in the evening. Maybe a little too close to the restaurants as we sometimes got the smells from the cooking food but this is a minor complaint. Certainly a perfect spot to watch the world unfold with a full view of the Beach and the local tram stop.Only problem with the room was lots of little ants in the kitchen/bar area but our maid (Martha) did a great job at keeping the room clean....and the fridge stocked with beer and pop ( Tipping Helps!)BEACH : Absolutely the nicest Beach we have seen. Clean clear water lots of palapas to provide shade but claim your spot early! By 7am prime locations are gone and by 9am you are in full sun. Bar is close at hand but no Beach Service. IF you want water sports there is enough to fill your day! In fact, sometimes the Para sailing was actualy a little annoying but then that's just me.POOLS : Only 2 that we could see and unfortunately way too small for a property with the potential of over 1500 guests. We stayed on the Beach.FOOD  BEVERAGE : Here's the downfall of what could be a 5 star Hotel with a change in style and quality!!!!VIP buys you bottled beer and premium liquors. However, they never use fresh fruit to make blender drinks. They never use real juice to make drinks and unless someone like me tells you they have Heiniken. Becks, Miller, Budweiser you drink draft! Unless you ask for Premium Scotch you get EL Cheepo Brand etc. They must be getting bonuses based on how little booze they pour unless you ask. Once you catch on they smile and acknowledge your admission to the secret club and the game is less tiring. If you like mixed drinks though you had better get used to syrup and not real juices. Never had this kind of problem anywhere else in the Caribbean.Bring snacks 'cause if you don't like rice and beans you are going to be Hungry. I review each Restaurant we ate in as follows;Hispanola Buffet: Middle of the road  Breezes  style buffet. Ok for Breakfast but watch the salads at lunch and dinner. Everything always seems to be left overs and the Fish made one of our friends quite ill.NO AIR CONDITIONINGChopin: A better buffet choice for dinner and make sure to see  Mairlin for some great laughs and drink service. She is a real sweetie. Also an added bonus of a floating pianist and singer on the half hour. Yes, there is a boat.NO AIR CONDITIONINGBella Pasta: Pasta on this one unless you are desperate.AIR CONDITIONED AT NIGHTEL Gaucho: This restaurant is open from 7 am to 5 pm in a Buffet style. Convenient Location on the Beach and the food is passible if you can live on Rice and Beans.At night it becomes the SteakHouse.............pass unless you want left over lunch. My Argentian Barbeque was a dried out Lamb chop, Pork chop, Minute steak and 1/2 a Hot Dog!NO AIR CONDITIONINGMc Princess : Mc Poison de la food.........Raw Burgers, Horrible Sanitation and the souce of more stomach aches than I have ever heard.Sakurra: Asian Fusion....pleasant,and run by the world reKnowned  Freddie Palatable fare and we ate here twice because at least the food was cooked and recognizable.AIR CONDITIONEDLichey: This is the Gourmet restaurant and included 1 time if you are VIP. Otherwise, it costs an extra $25 per person. Actually good food which proved the Hotel could do better if it really wanted to!AIR CONDITIONEDOverall I rate the food portion of this Hotel at a 2 star.....just above a truck stop but not as good as Burger King, Olive Garden etc. This was our biggest disappiontment.SPA : Again part of our VIP package and well worth a visit. My wife had a full Massage and our neighbour the whole works! ( 4 hours) and both were happy.GROUNDS: Park Like setting and well cared for. The property is Huge! The trams are very necessary to navigate your way around. The Mangrove swamp is a cool eco site but if you are situated close to it, get them to change your room..............it stinks. The Bird House and mini zoo is a neat touch.While we would not return to this property because of our view of it's food and beverage quality, we can undertand it's appeal to others.Happy Holidays

<Content>Bravo Bavaro We knew this would not be a five-star hotel because of the incredibly reasonable price of this vacation. Only the very best hotels get five stars鈥搕he best of the best. Five stars from Ralph鈥檚 Travel Guide doesn鈥檛 count. If your travel agent tells you that this or any other Punta Cana resort is a five star, they are purposely being deceptive because they know better. And you should know better. Do you really expect a five star hotel for what these vacations cost? Although I will discuss the resort in more detail below, generally, what you get at the Bavaro Princess is a very beautiful resort with an incredible beach. The rooms are spacious and clean and the service is mostly very good. The staff is generally hard-working, responsive and very friendly. As I have found with other Punta Cana resorts, the food overall is okay and some dishes at some of the restaurants are actually quite good. The drinks are mostly fine, particularly if you get the VIP package which entitles you to top shelf liquor. The resort put on a July 4th beach party for us Yanks, which included an outdoor dinner buffet, a band, dancing and drinks. It was a very nice extra and gesture which was greatly appreciated. Service: With very few exceptions, we found the service to be quite good, often very good. The resort is very large, so there are hundreds of service employees. A few times an employee may have acted indifferently, but I just shrugged it off as that was definitely the exception. Almost always the service was friendly and more than competent. At times the bars could be quite busy, but the bartenders did a great job of keeping track of who came up to the bar first. I saw no signs of favoritism toward guests who spoke Spanish. If you have to wait a couple minutes, so what? Relax. You're on vacation. There's plenty for everyone. While the restaurant waiters and waitresses lack the skills and experience of waiters at good urban restaurants, what they lack in experience they make up with effort and smiles. (Although at one restaurant I asked for coffee with my desert. The waiter told me that coffee would be served later. I was a little taken back. I guess it is improper in some places鈥損erhaps everywhere鈥搕o drink your coffee before desert is finished. Perhaps I鈥檓 a rube, but I like my coffee with desert, thank you. Just give me my coffee and snicker behind my back, if you will. I did end up getting my coffee with my desert, and no, it would not have ruined my vacation if I hadn鈥檛.) Rooms: Simply decorated, but larger than at most of the resorts where we have stayed. Nice bathroom and separate sink/makeup area for the ladies. One day, I might give a bidet a try. Closet space large enough for my wife (she knew to brought a few extra hangers with her, which is something I never would have thought of). I crammed all my stuff on one shelf. Also a small dresser with drawers. Cozy eating area (small table and four chairs, along with a coffee machine on a shelf) which we never used. Room fridge was promptly restocked. Small sofa, along with a stuffed chair and coffee table off to one side. They bought in a separate bed for our daughter. Plenty of room for it. The room was cleaned every day and we had turn-down every night, along with chocolate on the pillows. Bed was fine. A little on the hard side, if that matters to anyone. The room did have a bit of an odor the first day. It might have been that the previous occupants were heavy smokers, or maybe it was musty, but the smell did go away after a day or so. That鈥檚 my only complaint about the room. The a/c worked fine. In fact, we would have frozen if we hadn鈥檛 turned it down. No power outages (in five trips to DR, this is the first time without at least one outage). The water was not quite hot (I would call it warm enough).  Beach. Even folks unhappy with the resort heap praise on the beach. Wide and white (like my stomach) with plenty of shade huts, and a gentle slope to the ocean. The ocean floor is all sand with only a few patches of seaweed growing on the bottom pretty far out where the water is too deep for standing. Plenty of shade huts. This time year, being the off-season, you can still get one (although maybe not 鈥渇ront row鈥? after breakfast. I thought the beach on the side of the resort close to the Occidental Flamenco was particularly nice. I took advantage of a cloudy morning and walked north (to the left facing the ocean) around the point and to the end of the IB resorts. The beach along the entire stretch was beautiful, although one or two resorts didn鈥檛 rake up the seaweed. Princess Bavaro beach was slightly nicer than most. My only pet peeve about the Punta Cana beaches is the occasional obnoxious odors from the 2-stroke boat motors. However, since I go snorkeling every trip, which requires a ride on one of the boats, I guess I should shut up about that. Grounds, Landscaping, Pools, etc. The grounds of the resort are beautifully manicured and maintained. The roaming peacocks and pink flamingos (why does John Waters come to mind?) are a nice touch, as well as the 鈥渏ungle walk鈥?with the bird cages. Someone told me there were wild monkeys, but I didn鈥檛 see any. There are a few fountains here and there. The grass is soft, and there are thousands of palm trees and other types of trees, along with plenty of bushes and flowers, all very well maintained. Hard to believe that a hurricane ripped through just ten months ago. It鈥檚 quite a distance from the beach (where our room was) to the lobby/theater area. There is a swampy jungle area which separates the two sections of the resort. Although I walked it a few times, we usually rode the tram, which actually was quite nice, especially as you went through the jungle area. One night, everyone starting singing 鈥淚t鈥檚 a small world, after all...鈥?For purposes of full disclosure, I will mention that at night you could occasionally catch a whiff of what I am guessing is a small sewage pumping station serving the resort and located in the jungle area. I don鈥檛 recall ever smelling it during the day. Since it was in the jungle area, I don鈥檛 think you could smell it from any of the rooms. You certainly couldn鈥檛 from our room. There is nothing particularly special about the pools, but they were quite nice and regularly cleaned. I鈥檓 a beach person anyway, but my wife enjoys the pools. The pool near the lobby is much quieter. Some of us stopped there briefly a couple of times, making it a little less quiet (sorry 鈥榖out that). One positive about the lobby pool is that you don鈥檛 have to wait for a drink at the bar (not a 鈥渟wim-up鈥? as that pool is never crowded. Also, the bar for that pool is right next to where you wait for the tram back to the beach, so occasionally we slipped over and got a drink for the road. Tough life. Food. About the same as other all-inclusives. Perfectly acceptable breakfast and lunch buffets at the beach and lobby. We tended to eat breakfast and lunch at the beach and preferred to sit outside in the breeze, with a view of the ocean, under the cover of one of the palm shelters. The lobby buffet has a few more dishes than the beach buffet, but for breakfast at the beach one can get scrambled eggs, some sort of sausage, pancakes or french toast, yogurt, fresh fruit, toast, rolls, coffee, tea, juice (the orange juice is more like orange drink, regrettably), and perhaps a few other things I have forgotten about. Lunch included one or two meat dishes (a larger variety at lobby), potatoes (french fries and boiled), salad, bread/rolls, fresh fruit, juices and sodas, coffee, cheeses, deserts, and again a few things I probably forgot about. The pork chops and chicken were usually pretty good, and sometimes the grilled beef was good (if you got a tender piece). You can also get burgers, grilled sandwiches and fries at the beach, but I didn鈥檛 try any of that. Someone in our group tried a burger and said she wasn鈥檛 sure what kind of meat they were using. I have had similar experiences with burgers at other resorts. The El Goucho steak restaurant had good food, but it is not air-conditioned and the night we ate there was particularly hot and humid. Every woman in the place was fanning herself with whatever was available (napkins, menus, etc.). Any vendor selling fans could have made a fortune. The fact that men had to wear long pants didn鈥檛 make it any more enjoyable. It was so hot that one in our group decided that the only appropriate desert was the flambee ice cream and fruit (it actually was very good). The food was good, however, and we just drank more cold drinks. For some reason, at all the restaurants, they serve the house red wine refrigerated (鈥測ou might be a redneck if....鈥?. In addition to being served cold, the house red was just plain old terrible, as others have mentioned. The house white was more tolerable. As others have mentioned, the house champaign is OK and provides a decent alternative. You can buy bottles of wine and the prices are reasonable enough. The lamb dish at Licey鈥檚 was very good. Licey鈥檚 was included in our VIP package, which in turn was included in our trip package. Otherwise, I鈥檓 not sure if I鈥檇 pay the $20.00 or whatever they charge. On the other hand, it was a nice setting next to the pond with the flamingoes and ducks and it could provide a nice romantic dinner for honeymooners or couples. And the food is good as well. The Italian restaurant was okay, at best. At least it was air conditioned. After enduring the heat at El Goucho, we would have been happy with gruel so long as the place was air conditioned. Same goes for the Asian restaurant. We did not try the seafood restaurant. Chopin provided a pretty good buffet. It is not air-conditioned, but we ate there the night Dennis was passing to the south, so there was a breeze and cooler temperatures and it was quite pleasant. Excursions. We did the four-wheel trip to a remote beach and cave. The countryside is beautiful and the swim in the cave was very refreshing. A note of caution. We did not book this trip through our Apple rep, but through an independent excursion company in the lobby, which apparently has a license to use some of the space behind the counter. When we paid for the trip in cash, the tour rep took the money behind the counter where there was another rep. A few minutes later he came out and told us we were ten dollars short and laid the money in front of us. Fortunately, petty crooks are not always very smart. We had counted it out with him beforehand and had given him three fives. When he came back and laid the money in front of us, there was only one five. When we pointed this out to him, he meekly told us not to worry about it. Nor did the other person behind the counter say another word about it. They had each pocketed a five spot and tried to con us for an additional ten dollars. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but just be aware that everyone is trying to squeeze a few extra dollars (or pesos) out of the tourists. If you are paying large amounts of cash for something, be sure to count it out with them carefully, and have a witness. If we had done it through our Apple rep (or any similar travel rep), it is unlikely that we would have had any problems. Others in our group did book a fishing trip through the Apple rep and there were so such issues. Shopping. We鈥檝e gone to DR several times and I am weary of the merchants. My favorite experience this time was the request for an additional $2.00 鈥渃ommission鈥?after the sale was completed and I had already overpaid. Nonetheless, we gave the merchants outside the resort some business and bought some stuff at the stores inside the resort as well. Usually, the initial prices quoted are so ridiculous that even if you end up paying only half you are still paying too much. It appears to get worse each year. I like to give the merchants some business, but I am tired of going through all the B.S. to get even at a remotely reasonable price. I am willing to pay higher prices at the resorts just to avoid that hassle. My wife, on the other hand, rather enjoys all the haggling. I am more than happy to let her take whatever she pleases from the safe and go shopping with her friends while I remain comfortably in the shade of my ocean-side hut, drink and book in hand, enjoying the ocean breeze and view. VIP package. After we booked, our travel agent informed us that we had been given the VIP package. Not everyone in our group of ten used all the 鈥減erks,鈥?but I did, including the snorkeling, massage, Licey鈥檚 and internet time. For me, the principal advantage was the Baileys, Gran Marnier, and other top shelf liquor of which everyone in our group took advantage. I am not sure about this, but the VIP may also get you a room close to the beach and pool (which we enjoyed). Smoking: Butt suckers鈥?paradise. Smoking is apparently allowed everywhere. Entertainment/Activities. About the same as other resorts. The shows were lively and there was quite a bit of good dancing. The audience participation shows are the same old thing: Mr. [insert name of your resort], best couple, karioke, etc. As mentioned before, the resort put on a July 4th party for the Americans at the resort. In addition to the food, band and dancing, they handed out Uncle Sam hats and noisemakers. They opened up the beach bar and also had waiters bringing drinks. We were joined by several Brits, who were guests of honor. After all, we would not be celebrating July 4th had it not been for George III. It was a fun evening and a very nice 鈥渆xtra.鈥?Kid鈥檚 Club. Our daughter (9 yrs.) no longer goes to the kid鈥檚 club and prefers to find a friend or two to spend her time with. This time she met a nice girl her age from England and they stuck together like glue. I did notice several children together with the kid鈥檚 club coordinator doing things during the day, and they put on a kid鈥檚 show for dancing, singing, etc. each evening before the main show. Apple Vacations/USA 3000. What can I say? Great deal. Direct flights. No delays. Arrived early both at Punta Cana and when we returned home. Conclusion: Most folks would be hard-pressed not to enjoy themselves at this resort. It鈥檚 on par with or better than the other all-inclusive resorts where we鈥檝e stayed. Rumor: When I was snorkeling, I saw a new resort being built on the beach near the reef. The boat operator said that it will be the new Paradisus resort (the current Paradisus is located right next to the Princess Bavaro). He said that Princess Bavaro will purchase the old Paradisus and merge the facilities into a larger resort, or it will be a sister resort with exchange privileges. Now this all comes from one source and I have no idea how reliable any of it is. We will soon know, one way or the other.

<Content>Nice vacation Just returned last night July 13 from Bavaro Princess, we had a total of 18 people, ages 7-67, I feel the place was wonderful. the landscaping is unbelievable. just setting on our balcony I seen hummingbirds, wood peckers, anoli's. sit back and enjoy Let me start by saying, I read the reviews and the forum on here for about 5 months before we left. Feelings were mixed, they were mixed with our group as well. But here goes...we left BWI on Wednesday July6th, USA3000, no problems with check in except one person in our group was waiting for the rest of us at US Air instead of USA3000, but needless to say we all got checked in and our assigned seats on the plane( that was nice after flying other airlines where it was a free for all getting a seat). No problems at all, but we had everything out and ready when we got to the check in counter- remember the luggage weight limit is 44 pounds per person, I seen one women moving stuff from her luggage to her carry on. The flight itself was nice- free headsets for the trip south, food was not what I expected, but it gets you ready for Punta Cana LOL.Check in- we booked through Apple, our rooms were already assigned, and we had told the travel agent ( TA) that we wanted to be close but not all together. that is exactly what we got, one family in 04, one in 07, one in 08, 3 in 09, one in 10. Luggage was in the room before we were. The families who came on Friday had to wait for their rooms ( I think the last one was 4 o'clock) But I checked in on Wednesday- got to the hotel about 2:00 and the rooms were ready, no waiting. I will not go through all the restaurants by name, but the food was pretty much the same throughout, nothing like we have in the states- but most of us understood where we were and were not expecting much. We enjoyed the Buffet in the main lobby the most- we could see what we were getting or not getting. And since we were VIP and free room service some of the group used that more then going out to eat. There is one place down by the pool that is open around the clock- they close for like 1 hour inbetween meals to get ready for the next meal. we did not eat there though? we just went to the lobby for breakfast and lunch most of the time. Every night except one we made reservations for dinner at one of the restaurants and ate there, the men were upset because they had to dress every night, but the women got to wear whatever we wanted- men have to wear long pants, shirts that cover their shoulders. some required collared shirts, and some you could not wear sandals. The pool- we went to the big pool by the beach, we actually spent alot of time there- it does not get deeper then 4 1/2 feet anywhere that I found. we stood most of the time in the middle by the island- had a place to sit our drinks and some shade for those who wanted it. By afternoon the water gets pretty warm- but it is still refreshing, beats the hot sun. The pool bar only has 2 sometimes 3 bar tenders so the wait could be long, we started getting out of the pool and going to the top part to get our drinks-usually went faster. But we also got drinks for the whole group at one time. No limit, the kids even got non alcohol drinks at the same time. You can get Bottled Budweiser here also but you have to ask for itThe beach was beautiful - very little seaweed, and after going on the snorkeling trip past all the other resorts- I think BP's beach is the cleanest. Sometimes it smelled like sewer, not sure why? the water was pretty clear and I did not see anything that would make me think the sewer was dumped into the Ocean? It may have been the way the wind was blowing? As for chairs and huts at the beach and the pool- we went down and reserved chairs every morning- no you are not suppose to do that, but if you want shade you need to do it. with having the older people in our group, and some who burn really easy we needed some shade. We did not really have any problems with it. We usually only had 5 or 6 chairs for our group of 18.  Language barrier- I think it was fun trying to understand what they were saying or trying to get them to understand what we were saying. But for the most part we did OK, except one night my son and his girlfriend wanted Coke at dinner and got Bahamma Momma's, still not sure how that happened but they just drank them. My son, 19, felt that everyone should speak English- but I kept trying to explain we were in their country, in our country we can complain about those not speaking english- but it is our problem in their country not speaking their language. I was tired of saying Hola. But I am home now and can say Hello LOLThe Spa- we all had our free massage (VIP), I think everyone enjoyed it, I went back and had the chocolate bath- which was pretty much a rub down in chocolate syrup, some time in the jacuzzi and then another massage- I think it was worth the $75. The casino- we went there 2 nights, we came home with $178 of their money. If you play with US dollars you get paid in US dollars. compared to the casinos in Delaware, NJ and VA, that one is very small. Just be careful when you play the machines- unless you know spanish you could miss out on the extra play for more coins, if you do not understand ASK!!! We did 2 excursions- Outback Safari,and the Marainium ( spelling is wrong),  It was very hot on the outback safari but we had Niko( driver) and Elvis ( tour guide), they were great. the snorkeling trip was wondeful. We also did the snorkeling from the resort. that was about an hour snorkeling time- we had stuff to feed the fish, but even without the bread you see alot of fish. Never had any problems with any of the staff all were very helpful, we did have to wait sometimes for a tram, but sometimes we just walked if time was an issue, we were close to the beach and pool so we never took the tram for that. There was one part of the resort that smelled liked sewer- but it all has to go somewhere and since they do not have the technology we have here, I held my breathe when we went past there almost forgot about shopping- if you do not like to haggle do not go,the first thing they ask is where you are from- I think that sets the price. plus the more you buy from one store the more you save. But I learned quickly, you ask how much thye want they give you a ridiculous price, tell them about 4 dollars less then what you want to spend- they laugh at you and say another price, I played the game 2 or 3 times and then told then my final price, if they did not like it, I walked out usually they will come and follow you and give it to you for what you want, if not a another store will have the same stuff and someone will finally give it to you for what you want. We got 4 adult emboirded t-shirts for 25 USD. Took a while and alot shops but I was not spending 20usd on a t-shirt. Overall, I think most of us had a good time,and it was definetly a learning experience for us all. Just be careful with what you eat and drink and you should have a great time. Make sure you take medicine along with you (immodium, pepto, Tylenol,Children's Tylenol if you have kids) I definetly packed to much suntan lotion, but better safe then sorry. Any questions please feel free to e-mail me Jetlady62@comcast.net I may post some pictures later, but I am not sure I have anything that has not already been posted. But I think I have about 200 pictures - just go and enjoy!!! Be open minded!!!

<Content>Great Fun at the Bavaro Princess A group of 25 from Europe and NA travelled to the Princess from June 19 to 26 for our wedding.We are well seasonned travellers and have been all over the world. The Dominican Republic is good value for your money. Should be rated 4 star. If you are looking for luxury got to Turks or Barbados or ANguilla. Some reviews are a little harsh and made me nervous prior to leaving.Beach: WHite sand, calm water - very beautifulPool: Not as nice as the ones in the newer resorts, water way to warm, (all the kids from our group got bad ear infections from the Pool water; doctor's office was busy)Grounds: Beautifully manicured, huge resort with trams (we chose to walk). Sometimes you felt like you were on a freeway with a traffic jam.Rooms: in need up upgrade .... especially matresses and bathroom. We had a great room (21) right on the beach. Sheets are old and towels are thin.Food: Ate at most a la carte and they were quite good. Much better then Hispaniola. The buffet was good for Breakfast but mediocre fopr supper. Chopin was a better buffet choice. You will find something you like.Drinks: specify if you want alcohol; they were ok. Pool Bar drinks were not as good.Weather was nice - it rained on and off for 1 day and a half.Wedding was amazing abd stress free - Gabriel the wedding coordinator did a great job. We had a beautiful reception by the beach (buffet of seafood and steaks), DJ and open BAR and partied all night under the stars. Memories to last a lifetime. Most stayed for 2 weeks and we were all VIP and felt it was worth it.. Spent a week in Barbados for our honeymoon.All in all it was a great week we had a blast but I would only return if they renovated the rooms.

<Content>Paradise I am so glad I get to review the Bavaro Princess. After reading the reviews on a daily basis for 6 months before I went and I have to tell you I had second thoughts. Well, I wish I never read them. Some people can find something to compalin about no matter what. The Bavaro Princess was the most beautiful hotel with a perfect beach where the seaweed was cleaned on a daily basis. There were many thatched umbrellas for shade on the beach and never had a problem finding one. The rooms were beautiful. The service excellent. Many staff members did speak english and many did not. If they didn't they would find someone that did so they could understand you. Learning basic spanish words before I went was very helpful. The pool was gorgeous! I read on the reviews that if you don't tip the bartenders you will be served last. I did not experience this. We never tipped the bartenders and received speedy service everytime. We did tip the maid on a daily basis and she was so grateful. Although the food is not what we are used to, you can always find something you like. The El Gaucho had an excellent Argentenian steak. Great Lobster meal at Licey and the fish restaurant (forgot the name). Bella Pasta wasn't great. Chopin was beautiful with a floating piano bar that was very enjoyable. The floating piano bar is only at the 8:30 seating. Food wasn't great here, but I would still recommend it because of the setting.Bottom line it was a wonderful vacation. Our 2 teens 16 and 18 came with us and had a wonderful time. Met many teens from all over the world.The only complaint is the entertainment. Played the same music repeatedly every evening. Well, nothing is perfect, but it was close.

<Content>what's the fuss about! We just returned from the Bavaro Princess and feel we should tell our findings since this hotel seems to be getting every nit pick comment that may worry people who have booked this hotel.We have travelled to the Caribbean many times and have never been sick once.I overall cannot see how this resort can provide what it does without alot of hardworking employees going 24 hours a day in the intense heat with a present atmoshere.We are fussy spoiled Canadians who eat in restaurants probably 5 days a week.The steak at elGauchos was better than any we have eaten in 5 star restaurants in Toronto.The breakfasts in the main dining was amazing the whole week.If you go to elGauchos,say hi to Freddy from Canada.We gave him a key chain from Canada and he cried,he was so happy.The beaches in Punta Cuna are the best in the world,the grounds were so well looked after,you will wonder how they do it.It does not have the brand new room look but they are beautiful still and we were very comfortable with it.The security in the hotel is an issue for us,they had 24 hour guards at all points of entry which put my mind at ease.I highly recomend the Bavaro princess to anyone!

<Content>I'm shocked and appalled at all the bad reviews. Its a great hotel! I have sat here for an hour reading all the bad reviews posted about this hotel and am absolutely appalled. I have just come back from my honeymoon and we stayed here from June 20 to June 28 2005 and had an absolutely fantastic time! The grounds are simply breathtaking, so well kept and maintained on a daily basis. I have read comments about 'lazy' and 'unhelpful' staff - this couldn't be further from what my husband and I experienced. Our waiters and waitressess varied depending where we dined, but we found all to cheerful, cooperative and outrageously hard working. We saw the same staff at breakfast, lunch and dinnner and then even saw them working the bar in the evening. These people are some of the most hardworking people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. They would always bring us drinks on entering and would cater for any request. The food in the main buffett restaurant I found a little disappointing on a couple of occassions and prefered to dine in the a la carte restaurants for dinner. Breakfast in the Hispaniola offered a wide range of food from omellettes, pancakes, cereals, breads, fruits, smoothies and of course, a cooked breakfast. The only complaint is that they tend to add too many herbs and spices which I find too much for breakfast. Lunch I found to be better at the beach buffett. Fresh rolls, fries, rice, salad, pizza etc. For dinner I would definitely recommend booking one of the a la carte restaurants as hispaniola was average in the evenings. Sakura and Bella Pasta both served excellent fresh food to your table. One word of warning though, avoid the seafood place El Pescador! The smell alone will make you ill!Our room was superbly clean with fresh towels provided every day. The maid always appeared around 3pm and was always talkative (although neither myself or my husband speaks Spanish, she would always try to communicate!) and very hardworking. There was no sign of rust or leaky taps or yellowed baths as I have read in other reviews. Two bulbs blew in our room and the electrician appeared on his little moped within 30 minutes!The entertainment was good on some nights and superb on others. The Lion King Show was fantastic as were the Princess Grammys! The audience participation shows tended to be in Spanish but were still good fun!The beach outside this hotel is undisputably out of this world. Pure and utter paradise. The watersports offered as part of your all inclusive package here were also good. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone and we met many other honeymoon couples who were equally impressed as us. Ideal honeymoon destination and hotel. Fantastic hotel, fantatic staff, fantastic holiday!

<Content>Sunny and pleasant My husband and I travelled to the Princess Bavaro during the week of June 12 to 19. The weather forecast prior to our trip was 60% rain for the entire week, fortunately the only day it rained was the first, the remaining days of the week were extremly hot, and humid with an ambundance of sunshine!!!! The all suite hotel was very nice and clean, but it did not have a television in the living area just the bedroom, which meant you always had to lye down to watch t.v.. It would of been nice if the television could of rotated towards the bedroom or the living area. Even though the all suite hotel said it had a bath and shower, but the bath did not have a plug, which meant you had to be creative if you wanted to have a bath after being in the hot sun all day. If you are going to the Punta Cana for the entertainment then don't go to the Princess Bavaro. The nightly entertainment has a lot to be desired! They gave it a good effort but, they really need to be more up to date with there music selection, during the day at poolside, and during there evening performances. As for the people, they were polite and helpful, but if your going to go there, brush up on your Spanish. The English that they speak is minimal. We did not go with the VIP upgrade and we did not regret it. The rooms are all the same, the restaurants are fabulous, we did not miss out on going to the Licey, Restaurant, we found the Chopin Restaurant to be our favourite. There beer is just as good as the premium brand beer that you get with your VIP.We did fall for one glitch in our holiday. They have advertised all over the resort you could upgrade your stay for free or get $100.00 free to play at the casino or $100.00 spa treatment for free. But unfortunately nothing is for free, even in the Dominican. We had to go to a seminar, what it is ,is Royal Holidays, they want you to give them a lot of money to become a member of Royal Vacations, so that your next vacations for the next 36 years can be all reserved through them. Although the upgrades did appear nice, keep in mind you are paying premium price for what usually is discounted vacations if you go through your last minute club. They are also very pushy and do not accept No we are not interested very well.Overall, we had a great time, extremely relaxing, the beach was outstanding, the food was good and we came home with a lot of wonderful memories. If you are considering this resort, keep in mind what I have mentioned and you are guaranteed to have a relaxing and memorable holiday.

<Content>Still prefer Mexico We stayed at the Bavaro from June 13 to June 20. We were there with another family. We had our 10 year old son with us and they have two children, ages 10 and 13. Another 40ish couple that we knew were also there at the same time.My only previous experience with an all-inclusive was with the Iberostar Del Mar in Mexico. This resort doesn't match up to the Iberostar. First, let me say that the beach was gorgeous. I thought even more beautiful than Mexico. The sand was soft and white and there were no rocks. The water was very clear and the perfect temperature.It was very very hot when we were there. We had rain the first day and 1/2 but it was beautiful the rest of the week. Due to the rain the first day or so, the rooms really smelled bad. In fact, everything did. There is a section of the resort that is supposed to be a tropical forest. During that time, when you had to ride through there on the tram, the sewage smell was horrible. In fact, you could see brown liquid coming from one of the pipes in that area. Once the rain had passed, the room smelled better after a few days. Others who pointed out that nothing dried - they are right. It is so incredibly humid there that nothing ever dries and I think that is why some things smell so bad. Even clothes that I took home that were clean and that I hadn't worn had to be washed because of the smell.I agree that the bartenders aren't exactly helpful and they don't have enough people working at the pool bars. The service was average or below at most restaurants. You could never get what you asked for without asking several times. Huge language barrier. Very few people speak any English - not even a little.The food was so - so. Definitely better at the Iberostar in Mexico. 4 of our 9 got sick. Not sure what caused it because we were all careful. I also think that they shouldn't stick to the men must wear pants when only one restaurant is air-conditioned. Our husbands choose to pass on going to Chopin because they couldn't stand another night in pants with those kinds of temperatures.My biggest complaint was this -- we purchased the VIP package. If you are a family DO NOT DO THIS. None of the VIP perks are for the kids. They are not allowed to go to Licey (so what are you supposed to do - leave them in your room?), you have to pay extra for the snorkling or anything else that you do as part of the VIP package for your children. Management was rude and out and out lied to us when we were trying to solve this problem. The first person said management was out until 6:00 p.m., and then the next said they were on vacation. That is how they handled things there - they would give you the run around. Our apple rep was of little help with this too. Everyone wants to pass the buck. The management at the Iberostar was much more accomodating and the staff was much friendlier and helpful.Lastly, the beach was topless, which I expected. But I didn't expect to find topless women everywhere at the pool. One was even breast feeding her child on a bar stool in the pool sipping a coco-loco. Go figure.Vacation is what you make it and when you are on vacation - it's all good. We just tried to over look these issues and we had a great time. I am just passing on these thoughts for informational purposes. Return to Punta Cana - I probably wouldn't, however, I am glad I had the experience.

<Content>Would go back there again anytime... I have posted this on the other - also popular site - so you may read it twice. First of all, this wouldn't be as much review of the place - which is excellent - but our rather humble comment - to some of contributors.It wasn't my intention to enter this good-bad exchanges (reviews),but after reading several very contrastings reviews, I have made a decision,to supply my 2 cents worth and contribute myself... And I can say: I'm doing this for the first time ever. (Of course this will be second time, first time was the other site.)Unfortunately, it won't be as much about this resort (or place),but rather about those people pretending to be a world wise travellerswho know everything best...To start with: I will not mention places I have travel to - or tohave an experience with, because it doesn't make sense at all.Instead, I will say only that this resort, by all means, deserves those four-and halfto five stars ratings you can see. And for you, those people complaining about small, petty,and excuse me - quite stupid - problems, I can say only this:go to the real world. But please, don't pretendto be a know-all everything person. Because you are not!If you were, you wouldn't mentioned those silly problems youmay - or may not - have encountered.Remember this: they can happen everywhere!In Paris Ritz Carleton or Waldorf Astoria in New York...It is your privilege to whine, complain (or -----) about everything,but remember: in the real world you can always - and everywhere, find something that p/o you, or that you don't like. However, there is a big difference between your subjectivityand objectivity as a whole...Now briefly to the facts - objectivity or subjectivity:We returned from Bavaro Princess in Punta Cana 11th of June, and by all means - and truthfully - we can say this: it was a perfectexperience and we had very enjoyable vacation. Again, we will not brag - ormention places we have been or we seen before, but regardingthis resort- it is thumps up, and its 4.5 to 5.0 stars rating well deserved!With an exception of a poor orientation in such a big complex, everythingwas, and worked just OK. (And we didn't have to buy VIP' suite...)As an example: there was a problem with lights when we arrived,and we had reported thisbefore lunch time. On our return - about two hours later, it was fixed!Would you get this in Sheratons or Hiltons?... I guess you will. But same we got here.And those complains about language - what a crap...You people think that staff there will learn all those languages theymay encounter: English, German, French, Italian, Japanese and so on...?Don't be naive. With an exception of Holla we didn't know much more.But we communicated with everyone we had to...And the last thing: please, don't be el-cheapo - as we have seen this several times.It means even if you are all inclusive, it is a courtesy - and I would say a normal thing - to give some token of appreciation in a form of gratitudeto a waiter/waitress that served you in a reservation only restaurant...I frankly can say that I was ashamed to see people leaving without leaving even thosepathetic 25 cents as a gratitude! Can you imagine to do this any place you live in: USA, Canada, Australia,Germany or Great Britain...? There you would be mark for ever!!! (And we are not talking about some huge tips, just a dollar or so would do thatand go a long way...)So it is all, and for your info - I'm from Canada - but originally from Europe.To close all this: Bavaro Princess is 5*PS: Try not to fly - if in Canada - with Skyservice. It is no good.

<Content>Very desapointed! Dont waste your money. I definetely agree with all the other bad reviews about this hotel. It is definetely not a 5* hotel. Their service is really bad and I'm not a person that likes to complain. It is true what they say about their staff being unhappy and unfriendly. They look like they don't want to do their job. They also take for ever to serve you at the restaurants and when they do, you dont even get what you ordered. This happened to us like 3 times. One night the menu was brought to us all dirty and also a fork . The rooms are ok except for the bathroom. The water pressure in the shower was very poor to the point that it took us for ever to take a shower. The ceiling in the bathroom also looked like it was about to collapse from a leak. The toilet was also not working properly. The food was also terrible. My 7 year old daughter vomited 3 times one night and my husband and I also got intestinal problems. You hardly see any seafood and the one that they serve you at El Pescador is terrible.Another big problem that we encountered was when we called from the hotel room to the US. They had told us that they charged $2 a minute and we only used maybe 8 minutes at the most. When we got back home , they had charged our credit card almost $400 in phone charges that we did not use.If you want a hotel with excellent service, food and entertainment go to the Iberostar Bavaro or Iberostar Punta Cana. We stayed there last year and we regret not staying there again. They are definitely a 5* hotel and it actually cost us less money. I also heard that the Bahia Principe is a great one also. The only things that I enjoyed about the Bavaro Princess is their shows, the beach and the scenery around the hotel. The landscape is really beautiful. I really wish they would improve their service and their food. This hotel does have the potential of being a 5* one.

<Content>Definately not a 5 star resort My family and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from June 3 - 10, 05. This is definately not a 5 star resort. Check in- We arrrived around 8:30 p.m. and check in went smoothly except for the fact that they dropped us off in front of one of the rooms and we could not find the other room. There was no explanation of where the other room was. It was just on the other side of the first room but you had to use a walkway or the quicker way was to walk through the grass. We had two rooms and the other room was just on the opposite side. It was 8:30 p.m. we were tired and just wanted to get to the room and not have to look for it. To me that is not 5 star service. I would like to be shown to my room. Then there was confusion with the luggage and it was delived to the wrong room.Rooms - They were just like in the pictures, except my personal items kept getting wet on the sink. I think the bathroom above us had a leak and it kept leaking down to our sink and vanity. I am glad I had my make-up in a plastic make-up bag. Forget about getting anything repaired. We had a light out on patio and we told them about it the first day and it was still not fixed when we left. If you go look for it and see if it is still out. the room was 265. Getting clean beach towels was something of a chore. We had the same beach towels for 3 days before I caught up with the maid and got new ones. I would lay the dirty ones on the floor by her card with a tip but still no clean beach towels.Food - Not the greatest but you will find something you like. BEWARE - There were four of us traveling and all four of us got sick. We are back now for 5 days and we are still sick. NO, we did not drink the water.Beach - It was beautiful.Bartenders - Not so great! One bartender at each station most of the time. I waved at the bartender to get his attention to get a drink and they would wave right back. I know they knew what I wanted but they took their time getting it. It was kind of a pain in the you know what to get a drink even if you tipped. Maximo was nice though at the pool bar, not very quick but nice.Entertainment- was average. Went to the shows almost every night and there was nothing really great. Most of the shows were audience participation and I did participate. We did miss the lion king show though because we arrived on a Friday and that is when they have the lion king show. We were too busy trying to find our room!Chopin - Does not have breakfast anymore. We went there the one morning and there was no breakfast.Hyspanio - the buffet that is supposed to have lobster on saturday night did not.I know many of you are probably booked there already so don't despair. Your trip will be what you make of it. Go and make the best of it. The hotel is just not 5 stars, but I am sure you will have fun.Snorkling - AmazingVIP - Not worth it to us. We used mostly all our vip coupons but still it was not worth it. I was under the assumption that we would be closer to the beach and pool which we were not. We were about a 5 minute walk away while some people with vip got really close to the pool and the beach.If you have any questions I will be glad to answer them. My email is lbeninsky@yahoo.comTrams sucked at the end, had to wait for about the third tram to catch a ride. They were all pretty full at the end of our stay. I had four traveling in my party and it was hard to get 4 seats.

<Content>Great Service, great people! My husband and I traveled to Punta Cana for the first time for a long weekend. After having read some of the negative reviews, we were a little skeptical not knowing what to expect; however, I must say that I was impressed with many things. First of all, the place is beautiful, the resort and ammenities were great all around. The Beach is lovely, enough sand space and then some. The people were very friendly and humble. The room was always well kept and spacious. No problems with Mosquitoes or airconditioning. The water is all purified so no problems with that.The resort is immense, so if you don't like big don't go there. You have to take a trolley from one place to another. We had a room close to the beach so we were able to walk. The only real issue we had was the food. They had a variety of foods, but there were very few things that were great. For the most part the food was average, nothing to write home about. Not necessary to do the VIP package. I guess that living in New York and having such a variety of great foods has spoiled us. We expected that the Dominican Republic would have really tasty food because the Dominican Restaurants in NYC have awesome tasting food. Overall, it was a good trip, perfect service and place. If you're picky with food, this may not be the resort for you. Although, after meeting people that stood at neighboring resorts, they had the same issues with the food.

<Content>One Place You Never, Ever Want To Go To I would rate this place lower than Terrible if that option existed.The biggest problem with this place is SERVICE. I found the staff (with the exception of 3) rude, uncarring and lazy. There are too many examples of bad service to list but here are some highlites:- When I asked for a coffee at dinner, I had to ask twice...the second time was the manager who then spoke to his staff member...that staff member then nodded to his manager and came back to see me 5 MINUTES LATER to tell me in SPANISH that coffee was only served at the bar. This would have been grat info. to receive at the time of my original request, not at said point.- The maids who clean the room tend not to come until past 6pm...so that instead of getting ready for dinner you have to wait for them to finish...on 2 occasions they did not come at all.- I have never been to a place where the word NO was so prevelant...anything simple request was usually answered with a NO...which seemed like the only English that the majority of staff could utter...The food was mediocer or verging on bad...the only truly good thing that they served was beef...I have never seen anyone do what was done to the lobsters at the Seafood restaurant...the poor creatures definitively died in vain as to serve them in RANCID butter was an insult...To go from the beach or to the restaurants you generally had to take a trolly or a 15 minute walk which kind of gets old and tiresome really fast...I would prefer a place where a 5 minute walk would be the case.MANY of the people on my return flight were suffering from intestinal problems.If you like rude staff and would like to experience service at its LOWEST level than head for this place...I think I would pick a Turkish prison over this place myself.

<Content>Very nice resort We stayed at the Bavaro Princess from May 23-30. This was our fifth trip to the Dominican (Iberostars-twice, Secrets Excellence and Bahia Principe). We have also been to Cancun/Riviera Maya. We would rate this resort as high as any of the others we have stayed at. Airport: Quick and easy as always. Check-in: Arrived at the resort around 11:00 A.M. and the rooms were not going to be ready until 2:00 P.M. so we went to the lobby bar and had lunch in the buffet. The rooms were ready as promised. One note on room locations if you are with another couple or group. The buildings are two sided with two rooms on the first floor and two on the second floor for each side (8 per building). Each side faces a different main walkway. This means you could be staying in the same building but not be close. To get from one side to the other you have to cut through the grass and shrubbery or walk down a building to find a walkway that goes through and around. If this is not what you want be sure to ask at check-in. Rooms: The rooms are very nice and everything worked. The rooms really do look like the pictures. Resort: The resort grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. The resort is very large so be prepared to do some walking. There are trams that run from the main lobby area to the beach. The trams are smaller and only hold about 18 people. They travel in a one way circle around the resort. Depending on room location you may have to ride around the resort to get to your destination. We also found that they filled to capacity most times at either end. If you need to catch them in the middle of the resort, most of the time they were full. It is faster to walk. Beach/Pool: Both are very nice. The beach is clean with very little seaweed in the water. The pool is large with a great swim-up and pool bar. We never had any problem finding chairs or a hut to sit under. Restaurants: All except Hispanolia, which is the main buffet by the lobby, are a la carte and require a reservation and long pants for men at dinner. Overall the food was very good and I would think everyone could find something they would like. They had made some changes from other reviews I have read. The only place that served breakfast was the lobby buffet. We tried the beach restaurants and Chopin in the middle but were told they did not serve breakfast there anymore. The other change was Chopin, it is not a buffet anymore but another a la carte restaurant. I think we were the first week these changes went into effect. If you want a buffet you will have to go the Hispanolia. The resort did not seem that crowded so I don't know if that had anything to do with the changes. The Bella Pasta and El Gaucho at the beach end were both very good. The El Gaucho was our favorite for lunch. They always had steak, pork chops, chicken and other things on the buffet. You can eat inside or go to the patio outside by the beach. We were VIP so we had the dinner at Licey included. The food there was excellent. If you go VIP, they assign you the date and time for your dinner at Licey. We were traveling with another couple and their reservation was for a different date and time as ours so be sure and check the coupon included with your check-in package if that would make a difference. If you want to change the reservation you can but you have to do it at the VIP hut by the beach. We did not eat at the Sakura or El Pescador. As for reservations at the a la carte restaurants you can only make them for the current day and the next day. If you are not VIP you must go to the lobby and if you are VIP you must go to the VIP hut by the beach from 9:00 to 1:00. The reservation system is different from some other resorts in that there is no maximum number of a la carte reservation you can make during you stay. Service: The staff we dealt with were great. I have very limited knowledge (simple phrases) of Spanish but had no problem communicating with anyone. Strangely the only staff member that did not seem to care about guests was the girl at the VIP hut by the beach. Tipping is greatly appreciated and they will remember you. The staff works very hard and have very long work days, so a little patience and respect will go a long way to making your vacation enjoyable. Overall: This really is a beautiful resort and is nicely maintained. We would not hesitate to return or recommend this resort to our friends.

<Content>More like a 3 star. The only reason I give this hotel a Okay Its because it is a nice resort and the grounds are well kept. But than again im sure that the other resorts in the area are nice. Anyway, my biggest problems was with management. And in turn management gives out the instructions to the workers. Most of them were nice but some were just lousy. I purchased the V.I.P. package and all I can say its not worth it. They give one price over the phone and when check out comes...boom they give you another rate. (They told me $15.00 per person, they charged me $25). The managers were rude and sarcastic. They didnt care that I traveled all they way to thier hot island to spend money. And when I mean hot ..its hot...They didnt even have fans to offset the hot, humid conditions. Oh, and when I asked one of the servers to turn on the AC he said he had orders not to ?!?!?!I can go on and on. To conclude, the service is horrible. I would never go back. I had a better time in Puerto Plata and Costa Rica. They went out of thier way to make me feel appreciated.NY,NY

<Content>Not a 5-star! My stay at the bavaro Princess was definitely not a 5-star resort quality stay! I called the resort multiple times to inquire about the VIP package and how it works, and they told me not once, not twice, but three times that the price of the VIP was $15.00 per person per night with a 3 night minimum stay. My stay at the hotel was from 5/27-5/30/05. To my knowledge that is 3 nights. At the end of my trip they charged me $25.00 per person per night. When I did the research on the hotel I went to their website and according to the website the VIP package included premium brand drinks, which consisted of Heineken, Corona, Black Label and so on. First of all the resort does not have Heineken or Corona, the only other beer they had besides Presidente was Becks and Budweiser. When I tried to get a Beck, I got bounced around from bar to bar. Or their other favorite excuse is to say that the beer is hot. After an hour I would go back and ask for the beer again, and I would get the same excuse that the beer was hot after getting upset and demanding they hand me the beer, to my surprise the beer is freezing cold!! When I felt like drinking Black Label the story would start all over again, they would try to send me to other bars, I would again have to show that I was getting upset then they would magically appear with a bottle. The whole VIP thing was just a mission, I felt like I had to beg and get upset in order to get what I was entitled to in the first place. I am Colombian/Argentinean, and I have traveled and eaten in lots of different Central and South American countries and the Caribbean, and the food at this hotel SUCKS!! All the buffets and restaurants are opened air areas, so there is no fans and no A/C, with the mosquitos all over the food. When I have eaten mediocre food, its usually at a 2-3 star hotel, not in a hotel that claims to be 5-Stars!! To top it off they have a public relations person by the name of Angel Mendez, who instead of trying to make the guest's happy and maybe wanting them to come back to the hotel, he gets very cocky and he is rude and nasty to the guests. When I tried to resolve the $25.00 VIP mix-up and also a late charge mix-up, he pretty much told me that was my problem and did not try to help me in any way! So travelers BEWARE, don't get caught up that this is a 5-Star luxury hotel, because it's NOT!!

<Content>Great resort! My boyfriend and I(both in early 30's) stayed at this resort from the 21st for a week. Overall it was a great vacation. In the Caribbean, I have been to Cuba, Jamaica, and Cancun, and found that The Bavaro Princess had the best facilities overall in terms of beach, food, and accommodations. I would highly recommend going VIP, we enjoyed every extra bonus that was included. Some people complained that they found the resort to be too big, however we had often walked instead of using the tram system. Before going, the weather forecast called for thunderstorms everyday, however, it only rained on and off for two days. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to return.

<Content>Paradise, paradise, paradise! This problaby was one of my best holidays ever. The resort of Bavaro Princess was huge, in the middle of a tropical garden with parrots, turtles, flamingoes, butterflies, bats and fireflies.We had quite a standard room but i felt like a princess being in that room, with fresh flowers on the bed and a marble bathroom. The breakfast was sooo great, it had plenty of choice of fresh fruits, cakes, eggs, they just served everything on that buffet. We had it all on an all inclusive-basis and the food was so nice that we all became fat. One of the restaurants had live music with an orchestra in a romantic little boat. The pool and beach bars served very nice cocktails (for free!) and my god, the swimming pool was so huge that I could have got lost in it. But there even was another one. The palm trees were all over the very white sandy beach...The only negative thing I can mention is the fact that it is not a good plan to rent a car in that area. So you have to do everything on those expensive excursions.What more can I say. It was just like a real paradise.

<Content>may is rainy season, and the hotel is 4* and less I stayed at this hotel in:may, 2005may is rainy season, it rained every day!! I should say pouredI traveled to this hotel with: spouse, We booked through Mont=royal,. Flew air transat. Flight was fine, exactly on time.We checked in quickly at reception, they were aware we had emailed requesting specific rooms by the beach, as well as king bed. All was as we requested, plus we had a bed for a child (which we didn't have) Rooms were in building 25 location close to pool, beach, restaurants, but you had to take the little train regardless.Take your map or you will get disoriented, the first few days.We didn't go VIP; which I would recommend. The sparkling wine is good, one of there good local products. We never had a problem getting a reservation for a restaurant, and never waited in lines to do so. We didn't use the water sports, or the internet.Overall, the resort was not fabulous. I only gave it 4 *'s , definelty not a 5 * , it is CLEAN, rooms, washrooms , beach lobby, but ..... it is a 4 .The shower lacked pressure but the water was always hot.We were not ill, , we didn't use tap water, and we were careful with what ate . there was a lot of mosquitoes especially at night and me who never gets bit, got some especially on my ankles. Beach - was incredible BUT, when it was windy,and it rained everydayThe beach is absolutely gorgeous, one of the asset of the trip. We never had a problem getting a chair or palapa at the beach Pool - was very clean but we didn't use it Activities -Entertainment OK but on the lame sideFood - El Gaucho - didn't go for supperBella pasta, didn't goChopin - we ate here twice. The food was good both nights. It's buffet though. El Pescador - the bestSakura - bad!!!Hispaniola -Saturday night is Seafood night.. best food we had at resort. Casino: We went one night around 11 pm and it was crowded, it was a nice change to the entertainment overall , We will not go back to this hotel, nor recommend it , unless what you want is a 4* with a nice beach, and don't care about eh food or the activities ( don't; go in may or December though)

<Content>An Absolutely Incredible Place My boyfriend and I just got back from Punta Cana's Bavaro Princess on Saturday May 21st and it was Incredible!!! I would go back to this place in a heart beat, and I would most definately recommend this place to everyone!! The grounds were absolutely beautiful, clean and well kept. The resort is very large and there is so much to see! The staff was great including the wait staff bartenders maids dancers and animacion team. The food was amazing!!!! neither my boyfriend or I got sick during our stay and enjoyed all of the food. There was a big selection and seemed to change every night so you werent eating the same thing for a week straight. The A la Cartes 'Bella Pasta' and 'El Pescador' were our favorite! all around this resort was perfect, in other reviews we noticed people complained about the place being too big, but there are trollies that are constantly driving the grounds to take you too and from anywhere you want to go, and there is about 7 of them. So you get the best of both worlds if you feel like getting exercise and walking you can or if you feel like getting somewhere fast you can take the trolly. our only complaint about our week was the weather but that is our fault. It is the beginning of the rainy season in dominican, and rain it did, but it was still insanely hot and we did get 4 great days, the rest were rain on and off. Bavaro Princess is an awesome place we had a totally amazing time despite the weather, we cant imagine how incredible the place would have been with pure sunshine!

<Content>Attention everyone... a warning for the future The Bavaro Princess met or exceeded our expectations so I have no complaints at all on that score BUT here is something that neither our agent or tour operator was up front about although everyone local in the DR including the hotel staff and our Sunwing tour rep there knows.May is RAINY SEASON in the Dominican!!!!!!We had 2 days of partial sun and 5 days of almost continous rain and I am talking torrential downpours both day and night - it had already been raining there for 2 staight days before we arrived. In the official Sunwing information book it states that rain season begins in June until November but our rep at the hotel told us at the first meeting that the major rain months are May and December. Had I known this when booking I then could have made an informed decision about whether to take a chance on the weather or choose a different destination. I have visited the Carribean many, many times as well as Mexico and this has never happened before, ever! The group from Puerto Plata sharing our flight home apparently had better weather that week but the week before was rain, rain, rain in that location as well.My daughter was pretty upset about the weather but not as upset as the couples getting married or honeymooning. So by all means try Punta Cana, the beaches are outstanding, but you might want to think twice before putting down your money for a May holiday.

<Content>Vacation of a Lifetime My partner and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from May 7 to May 14. We traveled from Toronto with Sunwing vacations. Everything about the vacation, from beginning to end, was magnificent. The flight left on time, and we were served champagne and a nice meal aboard the plane. When we arrived at the airport, there was no trouble at all getting our luggage and finding our air conditioned bus. When we arrived at the hotel, check-in was a breeze. We arrived at about 11:00, and our room was ready right away. The room was beautiful and clean, complete with fresh flowers around the bathroom sink. All suites at the hotel have a balcony with comfortable furniture. We stayed at the main hotel building, rather than in a bungalow. While some prefer to be closer to the beach, we enjoyed being near the main lobby, which housed bars, a restaurant, shops and entertainment. The beach was about a 7 minute walk away, through beautiful grounds, or a short golf cart ride. The resort has two pools - a very large one by the beach, and a smaller one near the main hotel. There were plenty of chairs in the shade and sun by both, and we never had trouble finding a chair no matter what time of day we arrived. The beach is breathtaking. Again, we never had trouble finding a chair in the shade, and we always had the choice of sitting near people, or in a location with a bit more privacy. The water is wavy, an we enjoyed splashing in the surf, or taking a kayak out for a spin. The beach is clean, and the ocean floor soft and sandy. We enjoyed the food. We ate at almost all of the restaurants, and always found something on the menu or at the buffet to suit our tastes. It's not north American 5 star dining, but there was so much variety that I really can't understand some of the complaints by other reviewers. I took Pepto Bismol every day and didn't get sick. We didn't hear of anyone else at the resort getting sick either. The resort is 96 acres, which I found preferable to other resorts that are just a building and a beach. It felt like we were living in a little rainforest village. However, off the resort, there was plenty to see and do as well. We took a speed boat and snorkeling tour, arranged through Sunwing, that was a blast, and shopped in the stores a few minute's walk from the resort. The best part about the trip however was the Dominican people. The staff members were wonderfully friendly and warm, with an amazing sense of humour. Not many speak English, but it gave us the chance to learn a bit of Spanish, and a combination of a few Spanish phrases and creative sign language resulted in us never having a problem communicating. I would definitely recommend the Bavaro Princess. Most of the negative reviews on this site to me seem to reflect the attitude of the traveller, rather than the resort. If you go expecting that everything will be perfect, and with a negative attitude, you will likely find something to complain about, regardless of your destination. As an example, two lamps in our room were not working, due to a fizzled circuit breaker. We reported it, and due to the language barrier, it took a few days for someone to come by and fix it. No big deal - when the repair person did arrive, I got an impromptu Spanish lesson and an invitation for me and my travel companions to attend the disco that night. We went with the flow, and saw minor problems as a part of life, not a recipe for a spoiled vacation. Go with the same attitude and chances are you will have the vacation of a lifetime. I'll definitely be going back.

<Content>Beautiful resort but definitely some downfalls We stayed at the Bavaro Princess from April 23-April 30. As a little background, I am in my 30s, no children and have traveled pretty extensively in the Caribbean this was my 2nd time to the DR, though my first time in Punta Cana. Me and my husband traveled with another couple as well.Check-in:Pretty painless. Our flight got in at about 9:00 p.m. and all of the front desk staff spoke English well. However, on various days during the week, we noticed that it was, at times, staffed with people who did NOT speak English and so I can imagine the chaos. I think we were just fortunate!Facility:As many of the reviews mentioned, the grounds are AMAZING! Absolutely pristine - you see workers caring for the grounds at all times of the day. We were struck by the beauty of the facility. It is very big but once you figure out the layout, you can easily walk from the beach to the main lobby in about 10 minutes. Our room was right by the beach (we opted for VIP, see below) and we thought it was an ideal location - we walked a few steps and we were on the beach! (room #781/783)VIP:I thought that the VIP service was definitely worth it. If just for the ease of scheduling dinner reservations. I am NOT a morning person so that whole up at 8:00 a.m. to make a dinner reservation thing just didn't work for me. It was convenient to be able to just place a call when we got in and make the reservations for the whole week. Also, the massage is GREAT! Also, it includes a 1 1/2 hour snorkeling tour that was great - lots of fish and they let me feed them to bring them right to my hand! Spa:Very beautiful. The only problem I had was that they charged an additional $5 for the hot spring jacuzzi in the back, which was ridiculous. It should have been something included in the VIP package. FoodI must admit, I am always skeptical at reviews that say all of the food was horrible but I can definitely see what people were talking about. I'm not a real picky person when it comes to eating either. The majority of people staying at the resort are European and I found the food to cater to their palates. Most of the food was pretty bland and boring, with the exception of Liceys, which was the first night we had a great meal. The food was definitely disappointing.Entertainment:Interesting. With the exception of a few shows in the evening, most of the evening entertainment was laughable. However, the daytime activities were very well coordinated and the staff was totally helpful and energetic about their activities. Though I spent most of my vacation sitting on the beach, I did enjoy a few poolside activities.Check-out:Unlike check-in, this was a bit of a nuisance. The power went out (which happened 2 other times during our stay) and they had to check records manually for each person. It took us about 1 1/2 hours to check out! Overall:For the most part, the resort was very nice and we had a great vacation. I found the reviews on this website to be very helpful and, for the most part, very accurate. I hope this helps and enjoy your vacation!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel My husband and I just returned from the Bavaro Princess (May 2-7). I was very pleasantly surprised with the hotel and it's facilities. I compared the price with several other hotels in the Punta Cana area and found the value could not be beat. I know many of the other reviews go over the various restaurants so I won't list them again, but I will say that I found all of them to be at least good and some were excellent. I didn't have a bad meal in any of the restaurants, but Pescador (The Seafood Restaurant) was my favorite. As far as the VIP, I felt for me it was worthwhile. I don't drink a lot so I didn't care that much about the alcohol, but I really enjoyed the massage, watersports, and the meal in Licey restaurant. Also I liked being guaranteed a room close to the beach. I have heard many mixed reviews about Licey Restaurant, but in my opinion the atmosphere was wonderful, the service excellent, and the food very good as well. I don't eat in gourmet restaurants very often so it was a nice treat for me. My husband and I also don't like very exotic foods but both found food we enjoyed.The beach at the hotel was breathtaking. I walked quite far in both directions and found the Princess had one of the best. I also enjoyed shopping in the little huts along the beach. Just prepare yourself to barter with the locals. It can seem a little intimidating at first if you are not used to it, but remember the are giving you a higher price than they expect you to pay. Also, if you can't agree on a price for something you want you might suggest meeting their price if they throw something else in. We did this on several occasions. As far as the beach palapas, they are at least three deep and I never had a problem getting one. I was usually at the beach by about 11:00am. I had heard you needed to be out there by 8:00 if you wanted to get one, but again I never experienced this.My only other suggestion would be to not be afraid to leave the resort to take tours, go shopping, etc... I did not visit the casino located directly outside the main entrance to the hotel, but heard from many people that it is the largest in the area. There are also several nice shops located across the street from the hotel and I saw many local people shopping there. By far the favorite part of my trip was a tour I took through Prieto Tours. It was the Bavaro Expedition. I would highly recommend it although I would caution to wear older clothing as you will get dusty. We visited a local farm in the mountains where they grew coffe beans, cocoa beans, vanilla beans, pineapples, etc... We were shown around the house, given fresh fruit, and offered to buy items made on the farm. We also visited a school and a sugar cane plantation, went to a small city and a larger city. The tour truly gives you a taste of the Dominican life.The rooms were kept very clean, and the hotel workers were extremely friendly. We went to sleep early on two nights and found fresh towels and chocolates waiting for us on our balcony, as the maid could not do the turndown service. They also always kept the refrigerator well stocked and the room service included with the VIP was also very good. Just a word of caution, only one drink per person is included with the VIP room service, they charge for extras. It is listed on the room service brochure and we never had a problem with this as there were always plenty of drinks in the refrigerator, but I understand some people did not realize this and they were upset they were being charged. Communication was never really a big problem for me. Neither my husband or I speak Spanish but we were able to pick up on enough to communicate. Also I found if the staff could not understand what you needed, they would get someone to help out. As far as the hotel grounds, they were very clean and tropical. I have been to several hotels in the caribbean and I would say that hands down this was the most beautiful. I would without hesitation recommend the hotel

<Content>Great value for the $$$$ Just returned from the B Princess w/our family of 4, 2 adults, 2 kids, ages 5  10, April 30-May6th. We had a fabulous time here! Went through APPLE, mostly all the arrangements - flights, transfers, excursions- were flawless. Got through the airport in less than 10 minutes, checked into the hotel around 2:30. They assigned us a room but told us to come back in 20 minutes  it will be ready - I politely asked for the key, promising we wouldn't go to the room directly, just would save us an extra trip back. The key was promptly given to us  off we went to the lobby for a drink. A few moments later, they found us  told us there was a problem with that room  we were reassigned another. We arrived at our room in BLDG 75 promptly at 3PM. The room was great, we got 2 twin beds for the kids that were delivered in less than 30 minutes  off we went to the beach - a 30 second walk from our room! Lovely sand, breezy palm  coconut trees, just lovely. Yes, if you want a front row thatched hut to relax under, get out there before 7AM to stake your claim with YOUR OWN beach towels - we brought 2  never worried about towel cards or figuring out which blue towel among 600 was ours. Oh,  the room had a bidet - nice touch! The food was always satisfying, just not over-the-top gourmet. We didn't care for El Gaucho, LOVED Sakura, enjoyed Bella Pasta ( where  Chicken Marsala on the menu really means Chicken Parmiagian!)  loved the beach fries  burgers.The employees are ALWAYS working - raking, cooking, cleaning. The maid spent at least 45 minutes per room, even wiping off the numbers of the room embedded in the wall! The trams were always running  a lovely way to see the whole resort. We enjoyed the casino very much, it was never crowded  very loose on the blackjack game. The kids entertainment was great every night, although my kids were shy about getting on stage. Most of the adult shows were very good, great singing, colorful costumes.We took 1 excursion to swim with the sharks  manta rays  really enjoyed it. Lots of snorkeling, merengue  drinks!Didn't shop too much but bought a lovely painting of TAINO figures, the original inhabitants of the DR.My best advice is this - take a Spanish/English dictionary with you, learn a few phrases  it will really take you far in enjoying yourself  getting things done - we needed to call APPLE to confirm our flight  the front desk wanted me to do it myself, using a $10 phone deposit, blah, blah, blah - I smiled, tried in my best Spanish to plead  1 minute later, we were all laughing as they made the call for me. Another time we arrived with wet bathing suits at the lobby restaurant  they said we couldn't come in w/o a shirt or shoes ( they had a conference in that day so I think they were dressing it up a bit) - I pleaded  whined like an ugly American, but they stood firm- as my kids I waited in the nearby lobby for my husband to arrive with the key to our room so we could change, an employee came over to hand us 3 employee flowered shirts to wear so we could eat! This is the giving spirit of the Domincan people that I will long remember. I later apologized profusely for my childlike behavior. You will love the BP! Enjoy!

<Content>Absolutely Beautiful Just returned from the Princess Bavaro (April 23-30th).This resort is a beautiful, tropical resort.I met so many beautiful people inside and out.If your looking for a fun, relaxed vacation at the same time this is the place to be.There is a bit of language difficulty but nothing hard to iron out.The VIP is not worth purchasing for an extra $120.00 US.Even though I didn't want the VIP, my husband wanted only for the premieum drinks like Bailey's and Budweiser beer.But then again we paid $90.00us for the both of us to get and had it for 5 days.So we used the premium drinks, the motorized watersports, and the snorkeling.But as for the restaurant Licey's it's definitely not worth it.The food is terrible.If you are a person who is use to cavier and gourmet food then you will like this restaurnat if not, don't buy it.Secondly the rest of the food in the restaurants is awesome.Hispanola's...you get everything you want.The pasta's are out of this world,if you are a seafood lover, try the seabass,and crab excellent food at this reataurant.Steakhouse which is called Ell Gotchos is tremendous as well.order the Argenina barbecue steak...excellent.The Italian resataurant..order the lasagna, this is awesome as well.But the best of all was the Chopin.....this will be the best reastaurnat you will ever eat in..it's international and the service is spectacular.This resort is very large so therefore you will have to take a tram from the beach to Hispanola's if you were going up to the lobby.But it's not a long drive.The bech is amazing and it really is the most beautiful beach there.We stayed at the Iberostar last year and this beach at the Princess beats that.The Iberostar and the Princess are the 2 best resorts to stay in .The Iberostar you have JR. Suites and the Princes you actually have a suite.The rooms are beautiful with a sitting area which is sunk in ,table and chairs as a kitchen, coffeemaker, fridge stocked every day..especially if you are VIP, you get room service, turndown service,bathrobes, massage, snorkelling and Licey's.But like I said earlier it's not worth it.But I will be selling this resort over and over again, as I am a Trave agent, and I absoluely loved it.I am not a picky person, but I do know where to go to get a beautiful resort.It's tropical, it has it's own rainforest with animals, but I did't go in it because I didn't want to find any mosquitoes.I didn't have much trouble at all with the little critters but I did find I was bitten at the Chopin and Licey's because I was on the water, but nothing to fret about believe me.We had a great time,would definitely go back again and again.If you ever have a problem ask for Carlos at the front desk he will help you out with no problem at all.If you ahave any questions please do not hesitate to email me at jarett94@hotmail.com, I will be glad to help you out.

<Content>Bavaro Princess certainly not 5 Star We stayed at the Bavaro Princess from April 14th - 28th 2005. We were travelling with two other couples who arrived from Toronto and stayed from April 16th - 23rd 2005. After doing months of research on resorts in the Carribean / Mexico we decided to have our wedding at the Bavaro Princess, based largely on the reviews and feedback from travel websites such as Trip Advisor. After getting to the Bavaro Princess and running a few kilometres each way on the beach every morning and checking out the other resorts I can say that the Bavaro Princess certainly looked like the best resort in the near vicinity ( Beach cleaned of seaweed every morning, raked weekly) , but overall we were disappointed with certain aspects of our stay. From a caribbean perspective this resort may rate 5 Stars but from a North American perspective I would rate this resort a between a 2-3 Star at best. This may seem a bit harsh but when you consider the vacation value that the same dollars will buy you in the US or Canada, it puts it in perspective. Now on to the review:WEDDING PREPARATION / WEDDING DAYThe overall ceremony was fantastic. Gabriel certainly knows the basics of his job as wedding coordinator, but again certain details were overlooked and not handled very professionally.1. The day of our wedding was April 22nd, a day that saw rain showers off and on. Hence the location of our wedding was changed from the Garden Gazebo to the front lobby courtyard. We went with the Magical Package, mainly because we wanted the extra photographs included in this package (which is essentially all we got --we never received our fruit basket or special wedding keepsake).2. Be prepared for delays here -- our ceremony was supposed to be at 5:00 but was delayed to 6:30 because the judge couldn't be located, which as I will explain later was a bit of a blessing. Earlier in the week my fiancee and I went to the spa to make an two appointments for her hair --one for a few days before the wedding as a trial, and one for the actual day of the wedding. We were assured that the person doing her hair a few days before the wedding would be the same one doing her hair on the day of the wedding, but guess what, it wasn't so basically the trial hairstyle was just a waste of $60 USD. So on the day of the wedding at the time of her appointment she was greeted by an entirely different stylist than the one she saw earlier in the week. Also our party had three ladies -- and there is only one stylist working. We had booked appointments from 2:30 onward, thinking that with a 5:00 ceremony that would allow for adequate time. The women didn't leave the stylist until 5:30 because on the lack of staff mentioned above, but because the delay in finding the judge...things actually worked out on time !! I am not alotgether sure how they would handle a large wedding party in this respect. 3. Next, the package included the preparation of the wedding dress and tuxedo/suit. Being a bit niave I made the assumption that given the fact the it looks like the resort has about 10-12 weddings a week they would know how to handle the cleaning and preparation of clothing made from wool and silk ( My suit and tie). But they don't, my new $1000 black wool suit was sprayed and ironed and came back looking like it was 10 years old and had been stored outside in the rain for 8 of those 10 years. And my red silk tie was again sprayed and ironed ruining the pattern and leaving two large noticeable marks on the front of the tie. Thankfully my fiancees wedding dress came back unscathed. But a word of advice , have your clothes dry cleaned and stored properly for your trip down, and do any minor touch ups yourself after you arrive, to avoid this happening to you. 4. Of our 25 wedding pictures maybe two were in focus, and worthy of enlargement. ( Our friends had 3.0 MP digital cameras, and their photos were better than the professional ones ) Also be sure to ask specifically for your negatives ( if you want them) because they seem to want to just give you a CD of your scanned wedding photos. 5. As my bride was basically walking up the aisle, Gabriel cut off her VIP bracelet and put it in his pocket, saying, rightfully so, that it would not look good in the photos, and that we could just go to the front desk and get a new one. We never got this back from him and spent the next two days arguing over where this bracelet went. Apparently (we were not told) if you lose or misplace your bracelet the front desk wants $40.00 USD for a new one. So Gabriel and the Front Desk Manager spent the better part of a day arguing about what happened to this bracelet. We eventually did get one at no charge, but it certainlly grates on you that you have to spend three hours out of your day trying to sort something out that is not your fault, and could be avoided with a bit of pre-planning/communication on the resorts part. So, the actual ceremony was great, but there were events prior to and after that certainly left you with the feeling that the attention to detail is not a stong suit of this resort.FOODAt some time during our stay our entire party had gastro problems resulting in diarrhea. I personally had it for the last 6 days of our stay, and am still sorting it out here at home (lost 7 pounds in 6 days). So a word to the wise take lots of immodium ( we took the 32 tablet package and had to buy more for the two of us) and hope for the best. Given this we found the best restaurants to be :1. The main buffet near the front lobby 2. Chopin Avoid El Pescadaur and El Gaucho ( where the steaks are so thin the inlaws will never come back.) Licey was ok but it was inclusive in our VIP, I would certainly not pay the $25 USD to go. ( Stick to seafood options here -- I ordered the veal chop and while this piece of meat was veal at one time, it certainly wasn't in this decade :) )RoomOur room was ok, but in terms of maid service don't expect much more than a changing of your towels and sheets daily, whether you tip or not. As well our service was sparodic, sometimes she came at 10 AM other times she was there at 6:00 PM when we got back from the beach. Don't expect your room to be cleaned to a standard that you would find at a 3* hotel in Canada/US. GroundsThe grounds were always kept in good condition, with lots of wildlife to look at (peacocks, iguana, etc)BeachThis was this resorts saving grace, and where we spent most of our time. The sand was excellent and well cleaned /groomed every morning. And the water was unbelievable -- we did some snorkelling right off shore every day, and saw lots of parrot fish / angel fish / etc. in the coral. Take a minimum of SPF 60 if you plan on laying out in the sun for more that 15 minutes. The watersports were a good diversion to take up part of the day, but nothing that you wouldn't find at any other resort. Staff / ServiceThere were certainly a few people that stood out and made the trip enjoyable. Benvinito at the VIP Concierge did a great job and made a point of looking after you ( Any requests given to the other fellow manning the VIP concierge -- they alternate days -- were never done)And Carmen at the beach bar did an excellent job of mixing drinks -- although I concluded that most of them were severely watered down. Other than these two people everyone else expected you too tip in return for mediocre service. We did this for the first 4 or 5 days, but then concluded that we would only tip ( and tip them well ) the people that looked like they actually enjoyed looking after you and made you feel good about being there.So overall the Bavaro Princess , from our perspective, is a great place to visit if you want spend your day at the beach, but apart from this don't expect much more. As I mentioned earlier this is certainly the best resort in the area, but given the other options available for vacations, and our experience here I can say that we don't plan on returning any time soon.

<Content>Oh dear..... a bit disapointing!!! My husband and I went to Punta Cana to celebrate our Silver Anniversary. We had told the hotel direct beforehand that we wanted to upgrade to VIP and also book/pay for seaview ect. since this was a special occation. Weeeell.... on check in we went straight to VIP.... only to be told - NO we do not have your registrations here. Come back in the morning and we will try and sort it out!!! Needless to say, bad start to our holiday. Also we had been put in a standard room?驴?驴 Having got down to our room.... and waited 1 1/2 hour for our luggage to arreive.... we were just to tired to fight, and desided to just leave things as they were, as we were determined not to let this ruin the whole 2 weeks stay.Generally we had a nice time.... some of the staff were really kind and helpful.... others a bit less so. The hotel is fine on the whole. But then towards the end of the stay, we sadly had some very noisy people move in next to us..... OK that can happen anywhere..... but have drunken orgies and what have you every night?驴? We started calling security about 01.00, and keept doing so every 1/2 hour..... and generally not before 05.00 would they go and stop the party!! Well we think that is BAD and totally unacceptable. In the morning when we went to complain about it - we were simply told that all the guest in that block and around it had the same problem, and that was that, and that they had stacks of complaints about our neighbour?驴?驴 So we were not at all impressed with their attitude. What is security there for, if not to keep law and order?驴?驴 So we were kind of relieved when we had to go home...... as we had not slept for 5 nights by then!!!!Will we go back.... no I don't think so!

<Content>Beautiful resort--great vacation We recently returned from vacationing at the Bavaro Princess (April 9 - 16)and can honestly say we had a wonderful time. Upon entering their airport, I was surprised at how organized and how quickly we got through. After immigration, we were quickly escorted to our bus. The airport staff were helpful and friendly. I found it annoying to have to wait for fellow vacationers, who felt it imperative to find beer before boarding. It was extremely hot and after a 4 hour flight, we just wanted to get to the hotel. The hotel is beautiful. The entrance is grand. You are surrounded by hibiscus, water features, turtles, parrots and sparkling surroundings. The grounds are manicured and spotless. The employees are always working. Washrooms are immaculate both in the hotel and at the beach. We were greeted with a cocktail. The wait at check-in was long but so what. The surroundings in the hotel take your mind off of it. We were lucky to have our room available before 3:00 p.m. A bellhop brought our bags quickly to our room that was located in the hotel section, just ouside the hotel lobby. I was impressed with our room. We didn't go VIP. We had a beautiful, spacious room, with air-conditioning, a safe, and a fully stocked mini-fridge. Our satellite tv worked well. We wouldn't have minded if it didn't--afterall we were on vacation to get away from real life and CNN. The shower lacked pressure but the water was always hot. The bidet was an extra appreciated feature. We had a king size bed, which was extremely hard and not comfortable. We wrote a note for extra pillows and we got them. Our living room was sunken, eqipped with a sofa, chair and coffee table. It was thoroughly cleaned and we tipped each day. We brought little gifts for the staff from Canada. They truly appreciated it. Remember, the staff work long hours for little pay. Tipping is beneficial. Our balcony overlooked a beautiful garden and the pool. I was glad that we were close to the main lobby. I found it to be convenient, especially in the morning for the breakfast buffet. People who were situated in the villas had to rely on the tram system. Often they had to wait, due to overcrowdedness. We never had a problem getting a chair at the hotel pool. You must reserve your chair early, in order to find relief from the blistering sun. I tan easily, and found that a 30 SPF wasn't strong enough. Take a hat, some comfortable shoes and light clothing. Finding a chair under the palasas at the beach was impossible. If you did get one, I found that vacationers, especially the Europeans, imposed themselves on your reserved chairs. How rude! You have to be adament. The beach is breathtaking. The sand is powdery and the water is turquoise blue. Rarely did we see seaweed. The water is warm but you can feel an undertow so you have to be careful not to go out too far. There was always a breeze which was a welcoming relief from the blistering sun. The staff are constantly picking up garbage which is left behind. You can't help but feel bad for the workers who never stop to take a break. They work so hard in the heat. I would find it unbearable. We found the drinks at the bar to be watered down. We repeatedly tipped, but still we were disappointed. The hotel pool bartender, Ruben, was extremely friendly and humourous. Unfortunately, the drinks were weak there as well. While at the beach, we ate at the El Gaucho for lunch. The food and the service was excellent. There was a wide variety of what we would consider North American style food--fries, hamburgers, hot dogs, steak and salads. It was easy to find seating. You could only reserve your dinner reservations for the current day and the next day. The reservation desk is located in the main lobby. I was told it opened from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. but I saw that people had lined up at 8:30 a.m. Line up early because spaces fill quickly. All the a la carte restaurants allow for a 30 - 50 person grouping for each seating, usually at 7:00, 8:30 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. This ensures excellent service. For evening dining, we ate at the a la carte restaurants most of the time. The Chopin was buffet style. The food was good. You could have your steak and calamari (squid) grilled for you. The food was comparable to the Hispaniola buffet located in the hotel. The Sakura (Japanese) restaurant had ambiance. You could order an appetizer, a main entree and a dessert. People seemed to enjoy the shrimp cakes. The pistachio ice cream is excellent. Portion sizes were just right. El Pescador (seafood) was popular and reservations filled early. I ordered the lobster for a main course. It was cooked with a black Mernaise sauce. It was awful. I was disappointed with this restaurant. Bella Pasta (Italian) was my favourite. The service was excellent and portions were ample. We ate breakfast and some dinners at the hotel restaurant, the Hispaniola. The food was repetitive at times, but there was always an array of food. In the morning, you could have a smoothie or freshly squeezed juice. Omelets were excellent and there are 2 locations where they are made. You could get waffles, breads, salad, fresh fruit, cereals, toast and main dishes like scrambled or hard boiled eggs, bacon. You name it. Their cream cheese is to die for. Dinner at the Hispaniola is the same. You have a variety of entries ranging from shellfish, seafood, meats, an assortment of salads and hot side dishes, like eggplant and roasted potatoes. Check out the menu board for the Dominicana night and their Seafood Night. They are both excellent. The displays are wonderful. We took our Hep A shots and the anti-malaria pills. We ate the salads and fresh fruit. You will see that the food is rinsed with bottled water. We were never sick. However, the food is rich with sauces so indigestion can be a problem if you over indulge.The best part of the trip was a day trip (12 hours) to Saona Island. It costs $85. US pp. but it's worth it. An air-conditioned coach takes you through La Otra Banda (cute town), Higuey and La Romana. You get to see the real Dominican Republic which is what I like to see--the real people and how they live. The tour guide is tri-lingual and gives a history of Dominican life. The speed boat ride to the island is a riot. You get to see beautifully coloured fish while snorkelling. Then you are taken to a natural pool in the middle of the ocean where you play Simon Says for shots of rum. This was a lot of fun and everyone enjoyed themselves. Saona Island is undisturbed and beautiful. It is adorned with palm trees, a shallow sea, and white powdery sand. You are served a fantastic barbecue of chicken, fish, rice--too many to list. Then you dance merengue and enjoy the day snorkelling and looking at the corel and sea creatures. The trip is videotaped and costs $40. for a CD, $35.00 for VCR tape. Upon leaving, you take a catamaran back to the bus. You are fed fruit and several drinks while dancing the merengue with the staff. Take lots of sunscreen and drink lots of water. The drinks are strong. This trip was a lot of fun, and it was nice to get out of the resort for a day. We shopped in the Bavaro Plaza just outside the entrance to the resort and across from the casino. Be prepared to be approached constantly. It pays to be kind, afterall you are a guest in their country. If you don't want to be hassled, don't go shopping. We bartered. The shop owners are persistent but eventually you usually come to a reasonable sale. Try to find Josepha. Her shop is located in the 3rd last shop, on the outside of the plaza and to the right, next to the empty lot where the buses park. She is so full of life and is so kind. She'll give you a good deal. Make sure to attend the meeting with Emilio, or whoever your trip representative is. We went with Sunwing Tours. You are told explicitly to have yourself checked out by 7:00 a.m. so that the bus can pick you up for 7:50 a.m. There is no line-up. It's your responsibility to ensure that your luggage is on the same bus that you are on. We didn't wait for the bellhop to pick up our luggage. We took it down ourselves to avoid any hassles. For those that miss the bus, it's their own fault. They are forewarned.In trying to rank a resort it is difficult. It's all relative because you must keep in mind that the Dominican Republic is a third world country. The people speak Spanish, but conversing is not difficult. Try to speak their language. Afterall, you are in their country and it's important to remember respect. Too often I saw people speaking rudely to the staff for such ridiculous matters. They're not your slave. They're earning an honest living.I would highly recommend this place. There were several children who seemed to enjoy the pool activities. Night time entertainment is a bit hokey, but enjoyable. Go with an open mind, keep your values and standards at home, and you'll have a great time.

<Content>Absolute Paradise We stayed at the Bavaro Princess from Apr. 2-9.We travelled with a group of 12 and were married at the resort.It was a great vacation. The resort is very large but if you do not care to walk they do provide a tram service. It is only about a 8-10 minute walk from the lobby to the beach. The grounds are kept beautiful.The room was huge and very clean. The maids work around the clock to keep things so clean.The service that the workers provide is top notch and they always greet you with a smile and Ola.The food was good although some what repetitive. We tried most of the a la cartes and enjoyed the Steak House the best. The Hispanola buffet was very very good also.The beach and sun are unbelievable. The sun is very hot. By the ocean there is a nice breeze, but by the pool it is very stuffy.We only saw one show and it was well put together. The animation team put in long days to entertain the guests.The only problem that we encountered was with check-in. We were put in rooms near the sewage plant and this to me was unacceptable. As a wedding party I thought that they would have considered this. So with a little discussion with the front desk guy, he had our whole party moved closer to the beach.We were all vip, which has its perks. The massages were nice.The wedding was like something out of a movie! Pure paradise. I could not have asked for a nicer wedding service and an unforgettable day.We will definately be back to this resort for our next trip.

<Content>Nice Resort, and you will not be disappointed, but...... Okay, a group of us, (7 couples), attended here for the week of April 9 - 16, 2005. It was expansive and enjoyable. Here are the highlights:Pros:Great Beach, the best I have seen. The sand is soft and the water warm and refreshing. This is the highlight of the trip.Make sure you get a room by the beach as you can spend most of your time here as there are several resturants, bars and amenities close by. The suites (which we had), were large and clean. The villas are 8 rooms over 2 stories. Very nice.The mini bar is well stocked every day.The food is very good, at all the resturants we attended, including the main buffet, (very large and good assortment of food for all meals), the beach resturant for breakfast and lunches, very good, and also has a hamburger and fries booth that can be accessed for both the resturant and beach, however they have one poor guy trying to make and dispense same, and he has a lot of trouble keeping up. At night, this resturant becomes the streak house and the food is good. Unfortunately it is an alacarte and you have to wear long pants and it is not airconditioned and quite frankly when we were there, that night, it was extremely humid and uncomforatable. There are 2 other resturants here, that is the Italian and Seafood, which are separate, and we split the group up and I along with 4 others, went to the Italian and it was quite good and reviews of the Seafood, was also quite good, however the service for both were slow. I must say that the staff in the Italian resturant were friendly. I, (I am a male), was with 4 other females (my wife was having the Seafood), and one of the females I was sitting with suggested I had these 4 women as wives. I was being high fived all dinner and the day following when the staff saw me. It was a lot of fun. We also attended the Chopin, but it was nothing special.The best food was the main buffet for variety and a Great pasta bar.The alcohol for those of us that were not VIP, (that was me), was quite good and thier draft beer, El Presidente is good. One of the 7 couples had VIP and they got us several premium drinks including Budweiser. Note, the main advantage of the VIP appears to be the location of the room. We had a great location without as 3 of the couples were at this resort the week earlier and were able to all of us great rooms near the beach. It's where you want to be. The grounds for the most part was clean, but if it wants to be a true 5 star, it needs to be better manicured and a bit cleaner. I just Don't think the Dominicans are as good as the Mexicans for perfection of their grounds for a 5 Star.A large number of females, were topless and despite what an earlier reviewer said, it never grew old. There were a lot of females with great bodies.The lobby is well done.We did not see any shows. Too tired at the end of the day.I did not attend the Casino, but some of our group did and enjoyed it.Cons:There are a few as follows:I found that staff would put garbage bags on the grass near the beach rooms for pick-up the following day and the animals would get into them making a mess. This is inexcusanble for a 5 star and the bags should be left in a garbage room or picked up immediately.The grounds could be manicured better. Not bad though, but I have seen better at a five star.My room Air conditioning was great, but one of our group, close friends of ours, had a poor Air conditioning. It was too hot and humid this week to have that happen. Complaints of about 5 times rendered no results. No excuse for this as you need relief from the heat at times, at least I do. The staff tried to repair it but could not. This is unbelievable, as surely somebody can repair these properly, as they must have problems from time to time, with other units. Our friends did not want to move due to their location.The trains that carry you around are often full and hard to get onto. They need more units.The check-in was rediculous. A huge line and only one check-in. I have seen much better, such as a group meeting in a room where they have your check-in envelopes ready to give to you immediately. ess Also, we had no access to our room until 5 PM. Oh well we partied anyway and used another room of our groups. The only thing that really annoyed me was the day of check-out. The day prior I heard another guest complaining to the front desk that she missed her bus to the airport because they failed to pick up her bags from her room and she could not leave as she did not have same.I was determined that this would not happen to me, and called ahead the night before to ensure they picked my bags up at 6:30 AM for my 7:30 bus departure. At about 7 AM I called 3 X saying I needed my bags picked up. by 7:10 PM, I still was waiting to get my bags picked up when I screamed at the front desk that they would be paying for my cab to the airport if I missed the bus because of their poor sevice. The were there in 5 minutes, but the baggage cart could not talke people and a such I had to take the train which I had to wait for. I finally just made it right at 7:30 to make the bus but I do not need this stress during my vacation. This made a very good vacation, reduced in enjoyment.Poor water pressue fo showers.In all I liked this resort, and the weather was great. Would I go back, not likely, as I prefer Mexico and their people. This resort is really trying to be a 5 star, but not quite cutting it.

<Author>jlhafeme
<Content>hola! To preface this review, we felt it was important to give a sense of who we are and where we're coming from... we have travelled to Punta Cana four times in the past two years (in fact, resorts immediately adjacent to the Bavaro Princess) and we have enjoyed ourselves immensely each time we've been, including this last time. We love reading the various reviews posted and have found them to be both informative and amusing; we therefore felt an obligation to finally write one of our own. We are two friends, early thirties, who enjoy the beautiful weather and a brief respite from our cold, Northeastern Ohio winters... (refer to photo 1 to see who we are, if you are so inclined). We are not particularly adventurous girls鈥?no scuba diving, no outback safaris...we鈥檙e perfectly content just soaking up the sun and acquiring tans that will make our friends back home jealous. Even more than the sun, we absolutely love having the opportunity to meet people from around the world and even our own country... it's refreshing and we've always made friends with whom we have remained in contact well after the vacation has ended. If you also like meeting people from other countries, then this is the place for you!Now. To the review.Overall, we enjoyed ourselves. Obviously, you'll have read other reviews and we do not intend to repeat any ubiquitous facts about the resort if possible.Location: Upon arrival, we discovered that we had what might be considered one of the loveliest rooms available... right on the beach, close to the pool... perfect (Note: we were not VIP, and were in bungalow #2 鈥?see pictures 2 and 3). It was the furthest point from the lobby (about 陆 mile), but was closest to the beach. We did take the tram, but it ran reliably and we only required it in the evenings when we were going to/from from the lobby bar and casino. (p.s. 鈥?the tram stops at midnight, but on a couple of occasions, their driver took us back to our room well after 2 a.m.) It should be mentioned that we met a nice group of people from Canada who had opted for the VIP upgrade but received a room next to the parking lot, poor things鈥?Apparently, upgrading to VIP carries with it its own uncertainties... Food  Drink: Regarding the food/drink... Two things to be noted: We are drinkers. If you have a propensity towards Tangueray and tonics, or anything which requires ice for that matter, you are going to experience a fair amount of distress (ice melts very quickly in the tropics!) Albeit we generally have travelled earlier than April and understood that the phrase Mas hielo, por favor (More ice, please) would be a necessary evil, it was considerably warmer this time around and so we found ourselves frequenting the air-conditioned bar located at the casino for drinks that could hold an ice cube longer than thirty seconds ($5 dollars U.S.) However, we're drinkers and found this to be an amenable solution nonetheless. (hehehe... what can we say???) Second point: Food. All in all, what we expected (catering to the European palate). However, wholly unexpectedly, we did get sick for a couple of days. Disappointing and a deterrent to fun, but then again, other individuals we spoke to experienced no problems whatsoever. We鈥檝e never been sick before, and honestly have a tendency to return a bit larger than when we left... we could never quite figure out the culprit, so good luck with that... seems to be somewhat random. Best advice is to use your best judgement: if you see runny scrambled eggs with raw yolks atop or a man carving up a raw turkey, it might be a good idea to cease and desist. We cannot accurately comment on the various restaurants aside from La Bella Pasta and Chopin鈥?both were good. However, we鈥檙e not fond of the constraint of having reservations, so we ended up at La Hispaniola (the buffet) almost every night鈥?Juan Felix at La Hispaniola was a total sweetheart and made our times there extremely pleasant (See photo 7). Additionally, Mac Princess (See photo 6), the bar at the beach, is open 24/7 and allowed for wonderful evenings in which to enjoy the surf (hehehe鈥?and any other distractions you might wish to consider at that hour of the day鈥?.The Scenery: The beach is absolutely gorgeous鈥?nothing new here, we know, but it has to be said (See photos 4 and 5). The pool seemed to be more the spot for families (i.e. children) to gather, but was lovely as well. Also too, as an aside and in keeping with other reviewers, you might want to consider taking an insect repellant of some sort, unless you don鈥檛 might the occasional bite鈥?In Conclusion: We, as always, had a blast. Certainly, tainted by a bit of illness, but we are affable, amenable girls who can make the best of any situation. Go. You鈥檒l have fun, one way or the other (See photo 8). We hope this review has been informative and welcome any questions/comments you may wish to offer.p.s. We apologize for the low resolution/size of the photos, but can accomodate larger versions should you so desire...

<Content>Very very good Just came back from DR. Stayed in Princess from 04/08-04/15. We travelled with 3 year old girl. I don't have any complains, even though I haven't been in any other hotels in DR so have nothing to compare with. At first, I would like to thank everybody who posted reviews, they were very very helpfull!!!Didn't have any problems with water, this was most I was afraid of. Just in case, we used bottled water even to brush teeth, but my boyfriend use regular water and didn't get sick. there were some mosquitos, but what can you expect? Food was pretty good, the only one we didn't try was Licey, didn't want to pay extra. We didn't like Sakura at all, at my taste, it is really really far from real asian cuisine. Chopin was very good, El Pascador is the only restaraunt which serves seafood. Weather was really nice. We went shopping to Plaza Bavaro and the other plaza accross the street. Prices are definetely much lower there then in the hotel. My daughter wanted braids, and she has long hair. In the hotel they asked $40. And we paid $20 at plaza. the only thing you have to be aware that they are chaging extra for beads!!!!Trains are running every 5-7 min so no problem getting anywhere. My daughter loved mini disco. Shows were pretty good too. Not sure if we come back to that hotel but only because we wanted to see something else. But definetly very good hotelEnjoy your stay

<Content>beautiful resort.. well we just got back last night from the bavaro princess, what a nice resort..I had read the reviews before going and I was a bit scared because of some of the reviews. well to start we had the VIP package so wo got a room close to the pool and beach. (room #295). The resort is huge, it's kept very clean, and the food was excellent. We did the licey's one night, it was our favorite. We did the el gaucho, bella pasta, the seafood and the choplin. We didn't care for the choplin, there was a lot of mosquitos and i got a bit scared because we didn't take the anti-malaria pills. And it was buffet which i think the buffet at the lobby was better. For the beach...it's the best. The water was wonderful, we had no problems finding huts..you got to go by 8h am. The staff is great..Always cheerful...Lots of boobs on the beach..after a few days you don't notice them anymore.We would definetly go back to this resort...go and enjoy!!!

<Content>Bavaro Princess Escape to Paradise I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from March 31, 2005 - April 7, 2005 and 4 of us went total and we all had a wonderful time. The resort has everything you need!! Especially if you decide to upgrade your package to VIP member status upon check in. I would recommend doing this if you enjoy water sports and room service upon demand!! Only the VIP can order room service at no charge at any time and even if you run out of beer in your mini fridge someone from the front will drive it over to your room within minutes!! The people in Dominican are Great!! There is so much personal attention and customer service at this resort. My husband and I travel somewhere nice at least once a year and we have never said we would go back to a particular place until we went here. The grounds are beautiful, yet large, bring comfy shoes!!! Or you can wait around for the tran that is constantly running around the complex. The food is definantely not american, but you have to expect that you are in a foreign country. There are at least many different places to go eat on site. My favorite buffet was the Chopin!! Make your reservations before 10 am to get an early dinner seating, we made that mistake once and ended up eating at 10:30 pm. If your VIP you can also call in your dinner reservations in the morning and make sure to mention your a VIP guest to get an early dinner.You can go sailing on your own cattamaran, or ride the banana boat, or if you have your diving card you recieve a free hour dive, and an hour snorkel all with VIP status. That's more than worth it. It was $91/US per person per week for our upgrade, and you would pay more than that to dive!! So it's worth it.All in all, the beach is the best place to sunbathe with the cool breeze blowing constantly. And if it rains it won't be around for more than 30 minutes.The on site wildlife is great and there are some funny theatrics that go on at night in the main lobby. If your going to go shopping be prepared to get dragged into every store there is in the small town, the locals are very eager to get you to purchase from them. They are very nice to you if you at least look.Everyone speaks Spanish!!! Good if you know it, but most speak English broken if not full. You get very used to saying Hola!!!I can't wait to go back I had a great time. Make sure you wear strong sunblock if you burn easily, I have olive skin and I had to use 30SPF for the first 4 days!!!!If you have any questions feel free to write!!!

<Content>Muy Bien! We stayed at this hotel five years ago when it was Melia Bavaro, and were so impressed that we decided to stay at the same place this time around. It definitely lived up to my expectations! My favorite restaurant has to be Sakura. The staff here is friendly and goes all out to make your stay as pleasant and memorable as possible. Young children are most welcome here. It is a terrific family resort.

<Content>excellent for parents of 3 yr old We loved this hotel and had a splendid trip. We have travelled a lot, but prior to being parents had not craved the ease of an all-inclusive. We travelled with our 3 year old daughter - 2 career parents with a nanny that only works when we are at work. We were eager to spend time together as a family, to enjoy a beautiful beach and weather and to have a bit of time to actually read for pleasure. we got all of this and more. We did the same thing every day and it was heaven. Our days consisted of -9am-Breakfast at hispanola (a large a delicious buffet breakfast with cafe con leche). -took the shuttle to the beach - fun, didn't have to wait for it and watched the beautiful gardens and peacocks as we drove by-11am - dropped daugher at kids club, she went to the kids pool with a great babysitter named Bela and then had lunch - babysitter spoke english well so we could ask about what she ate or whatever.-went to the BEAUTIFUL BEACH and sat under a grass umbrella talked like adults, read novels and gazed and swam in the warm and azure blue ocean-1:15pm - picked up our daughter and had lunch at a lovely table near the beach under an umbrella - had delicious roasted chicken and french fries every day, plus a cold glass (or 2) of white wine-2:30 dip in the pool - it's large, warm and shallow so fun for us and our daugher. -3:30 family nap under the umbrella - there is a pleasant breeze on the beach so we covered our daughter with some towels. While my my husband and daughter napped i took a 45 minute walk on the beach.-5:15 another fun swim in the pool with daughter6pm-shuttle to room7:30 dinner at hispanola - we did not get sick of the food, stayed for 7 nights and ate at the same place every night. They tried to make it special and it was. Loved the convenience of the buffet with our daughter. 8:30 kids mini-disco on the stage - our daughter loved this dance class and we really enjoyed watching her and applauding from the audience - simply adorable9:30 back to room, put daughter to bed and relaxedI would highly recommend this for anyone needing a break in a beautiful place plus for tired career parents it is like heaven. Kids club is for kids 4 years plus but if your child has separated from you they will let them in at a younger age. We are planning to go back next year.

<Content>Was ok Just to let everyone know, this resort has lost a star since we stayed there. The room was beautiful, we could see the Ocean from in Bed. The beach was lovely as well. The food was ok, very repetitive by the end of the week.We had a few problems. First of all we asked for a King bed and got 2 twins. We also had paid for a VIP package which includes a room upgrade. The first room we had was so close to the beach. We asked if we could change as we had requested a King Bed. They gave us another room that was horrible and definitely NOT an upgraded room. We decided that we would stick with our Original Room and informed them of this. Then in the middle of our second night there at 3 am a bell person came in with a family of 4 who assumed they were staying in the room. Obviously the front desk had marked our room vacant in this whole switching/not switching rooms mess. We were not impressed. Our other problem was once we got back. I caught a parasite here. I had been to Dominican twice before (once at a 3*) and the Mayan once and had not been sick at all. The parasite took over about 6 wks after we got back once my immune system got weak. I lost 10 pounds in 10 days and was restricted to a diet of Gatorade and water. Health Canada had to get involved to track where it was I caught this parasite. Don't think we'll ever go to Dominican again :o( It is definitely worth the extra money to go to Mexico.

<Content>princess bavaro just returned o n 4/3/05. had a wonderful time. rooms are great. vip packaged a must if you want to be near pool and beach. besides with the coupons they give you it pays for itself.. there are trams to take you to all the resturants and the main lobby. food was good if your not a picky person. you can make your reservations one day in advance. if you have vip it is much easier to get what you want but your really need to be at the vip desk before 9am.. it opens at 9am but theres always a line if you go at 9. the sun is hot you really need to reserve a hut if you want to get in some shade at both the pool and the beach. my husband gets up early so he was on the beach saving chairs by 6:30am or else you will not get a hut. men must wear long pants to all resturants. i was glad a read about that before we went because they will not let you in if you have shorts on. there were alot of people that did not know and only brought shorts so the had to go to the buffet near the lobby which is ok but not for everyday. the asian resturant was our favorite for dinner, went there twice. breakfast at el gacho near the pool was good they will make fresh eggs but you need to look to see where it is that day or else they give you something that looks like eggs. and they have a hamberger stand for lunch bella pasta was great for lunch all near the pool pizza is great. ate there everyday.went on one excursion which was all day. went by bus that explained everthing on the way then they took you out to a beach on a caterman served lunch which was great and drinks then home by speed boat which was a really wild ride. we stopped at a sandbar that had hugh starfish on it. the place was beautiful and well worth the $84.00 US per person. we book this at the tour desk through apple .

<Content>Wonderful Resort! A group of 15 鈥?9 Adults and 6 children had the pleasure of staying at the Bavaro Princess. We all took antimalaria pills. No one in the group got sick. Two 鈥?three complained that their stomachs were feeling a bit off for a day or so, but hard to say if was the fact that you are eating and drinking a lot of things we are not accustomed to e.g. lots of fruity and syrupy drinks etc鈥?Over the last few years we have stayed at Royal Solaris in Cancun, Occidental Allegro in Punta Cana, Barcelo Maya, Paradissus Varadero and Tryp Peninsula Varadero. Based on my experience, I would not hesitate to recommend this resort. We traveled with Sunquest/Skyservice a direct flight from Ottawa. Flight was on time and there were no issues. Not much leg room, pretty much standard on a charter flight. The bus ride from airport to hotel was ok. No drinks or washroom, so best to take care of this before getting on the bus. We stopped at two other resorts before arriving at our hotel. Bus ride was approx. 40 minutes. Check-in 鈥?AMAZING. We arrived at the hotel at 1 p.m. and most our rooms were ready, even though check-in is not until 3 p.m. We had paid our trip early in order to qualify for the free VIP upgrade. When we picked up our tickets at the travel agency, nothing was mentioned on our hotel voucher about the VIP. I asked the travel agent to get some type of confirmation in writing, as I did not feel like arguing at the hotel that we had paid early etc鈥?Travel agent/Sunquest was unable to provide any confirmation. We were pleasantly surprised at check-in that all of us had been upgraded to VIP. Furthermore, I had sent an email before leaving asking that our group of 15 鈥?staying in 5 rooms, would be located in the same building and close to the beach. All five rooms were reserved in building 6, close to the pool and beach. Rooms 鈥?spacious, exactly as per brochure. All rooms have a lovely terrace not a balcony. Very spacious and comfortably seats 4 adults and a few kids! Food 鈥?The main buffet was excellent, lots of choices for both breakfast and dinner. Not sure how anyone can complain. For lunch we mostly ate at the beach restaurant (McPrincess and El Gaucho). Gets a little repetitive, but we were not willing to take time away from the beach to travel to main lobby for lunch. My parents did, and said the lunch buffet was excellent with lots of choices. A la carte 鈥?tried Le Licey Gourmet 鈥?nice but not worth paying for if you don鈥檛 have VIP. El Gaucho turns into the Argentinean Steak House for dinner and it was excellent. Bella Pasta, my parents are Italian, so we are a bit picky when it comes to Italian food. The food was good, but not great. My parents ate at the Seafood Restaurant 鈥?El Pescador and were not overly impressed. Tried Chopin for buffet breakfast, smaller and fewer choices, but a lovely setting. Did not try the Japanese. So in a nutshell, if you are staying for a week, and don鈥檛 want buffet every night, I would suggest making a reservation at El Gaucho and Bella Pasta to break it up a little. And, keep in mind that the buffet is excellent and has great choices. By the way, I emailed the hotel the week before departure, and made all my restaurant reservations in advance. The second day we were there, I went to guest services, with my email in hand and my contact name 鈥淎rmando鈥? The first guy I spoke to gave me a bit of hard time, but the other woman simply told him to contact Armando. Armando confirmed by phone that all was arranged, and in fact when the first guy flipped to the reservation pages for those particular days, my name was already on the list for my group of 15. He then filled out the restaurant vouchers and I was on my way. Beach and Pool 鈥?Beautiful, lots of chairs and palapas, but as usual, get there early to reserve prime spots. The beach in Punta Cana is one of the prettiest I have seen. You cannot walk the entire beach, it is several kilometers. Water Activities 鈥?Kids went banana boating 鈥?7$ US each, and had lots of fun. Two of the kids went parasailing, they had a 鈥渟pecial deal鈥?the week we were there 鈥?yeh right 鈥?anyhow the cost was $65 US for both of them. They really enjoyed the experience. Kids Club 鈥?I did not send my 3 year old to the kid鈥檚 club, but I did go and look at it. There were 4 kids when I went, and they were doing some crafts. Did not appear to be a great kids club. They were very nice, and did say I could stay with my child and make use of the facilities, balls, swing set, slide etc鈥?Misc. The resort is very large, but once you figure out the layout, you get used to it. Our building which I mentioned was close to the pool/beach, was one of the farthest points to the main lobby, and it was a 10 minute walk. Very pleasant since you eat so much and the grounds are so beautiful to look at. The trains run often, but a peak times i.e. lunch, dinner, they were often full. Zoo 鈥?true calling it a zoo is a little of an exaggeration, but I can tell you my 3 year old son, loved it. There were parrots, iguanas and various other birds. As well, near the main buffet restaurant there were geese, ducks, chickens, peacocks and flamingoes walking around. These animals were a hit, and the kids loved to feed them after breakfast. VIP Upgrade 鈥?Our rooms were in a great location, but I think the location we received was mainly due to my email. The rum is a small bottle, you get three cigars and the 20 minute massage is wonderful. My older son and his friends made use of the 1 hr free internet, and were happy to MSN a few friends back home 鈥?note: for 15 minutes of internet use the cost is only $2.00 US. However, in my opinion I do not think the VIP is worth paying for. Enjoy your trip!

<Content>well worth the money just returned; there from mar 27-apr 2.overall, better than most reviews gave. check in was fine and managed at 2;59p to book a dinner at an ala carte restaurant that nite-try this if you arrive near 3p.asked for a king and got 2 dbles together; wife called and changed room(near chopin restaurant) and turned out to be right move. shuttle service was wonderful and convenient and friendly.biggest problem with hotel; booking a dinner reservation. it seems that even if a restaurant can hold 100 people, they won't allow more than 50 for example due to restraint from ratio of workers to patrons-they won't budge on this policy so keep this in mind when you don't see a good time for dinner available.beach, pools, especially pool near main hotel-super.biggest recomendation-book a trip like the outback safari or trip to alto de chavon and really see the countryside besides a luxury hotel. it's beautiful, educational,good food, good shopping,good experience.all restaurants- about a 7 out of 10 with breakfasts the best.shows-5 out of 10staff-friendly and 9 out of 10rooms- 8.5 out of 10flight home- if you leave at 3p from airport, be prepared to spend 5 hours waiting from hotel departure to flight departure!lastly- bavaro princess tries to do a good job and succeeds most of the time.ENJOY

<Content>Fabulous Time! We stayed at the Bavaro Princess from March 19 - March 26, 2005 and had a wonderful time. Some of the previous reveiws were very helpful and made the trip! We had the Super VIP upgrade which was far beyond our expectations. Super VIP was fine because you get an ocean view room and the other VIP extras. We enjoyed the following with the VIP: the upgrade drinks (wine!), massage was excellent, the room was fabulous, Licey restaurant was excellent, snorkling was terrific and beach towels were always left in the room ...great! I would highly recommend you upgrade to VIP as you stay close to the beach and the extras as outlined above were superb. The previous reviews really assisted (they made our trip): take a colour face cloth, hand sanitizer, booking dinner reservations with VIP, ask to be on the second floor (better view), Chopin is opened for breakfast and is not listed on the map the hotel gives you upon arrival...so the reviews really help! The only thing that surprised me was the food as... it was excellent! The previous reviews expressed it was so....so; however, we thought it was excellent and there was plenty of choice. Also, we did not get sick and this was fabulous!!! We ate and drank everything and truly enjoyed ourselves (only we did not drink the tap water...bottled water only). We have travelled extensively to the Caribbean and this was one of the best resorts....especially the VIP. We have upgraded at other hotels and this was the best upgrade. We would recommend you take insect repellent because we did get some bites. We were pleased we took the malaria pills (chloroquine) as it took the stress away. The people who work at the hotel were by far the most caring and helpful people we have seen at a resort. We speak (a little!) Spanish and we were able to converse; however, they really try to speak English. We like to mingle with other cultures as this is one of the reasons we like to travel to Spanish speaking islands. Remember you are not in an English speaking environment and should expect to immerse in a culture. Also, most of the guests at the resort are from all over the world; especially, Spanish speaking countries. We truly enjoyed jumping on the trams and relating to people from Spain, Chili and France!!! It was so interesting! When we were snorkling we met a couple from Paris and shared our memories from our trips to France. This really adds to the experience of travelling to Punta Cana. Actually we have travelled many times to Punta Cana because of the variety of countries the guests come from ....you feel you are really away!!! The weather was superb as everyday was over 30 degrees and not a cloud in the sky. In fact, some days it was so hot and we had to wear the coolest clothing we brought with us (even in the evening!). This is not a complaint as the weather was perfect. Take good sun screen and enjoy the beautiful hot weather. If you want shade, go early to the beach as there are not many huts and you need the shade! I had a concern before I travelled about being in such a large resort and having to take the trams; however, they made the trip interesting as you really get to see the complex. I would recommend you stay close to the beach because it was nice to stroll to the beach every morning (to us...you go for the beach...the best!!!). Also, we like to go to our room during the day (to get books, etc. but back to the beach quickly!), and this was possible. However, the trams were always available and staying closer to the lobby should be fine. We like a breeze and we (sort of) had one being closer to the water....loved the view from our terrace!!! The beach is superb and great for walking. Our favourite restuarants were Chopin and Licey (with the VIP). Chopin has nightly entertainment (grand piano on a boat) so sit on the side with the water. We left the resort once for shopping to the Bavaro Plaza ( left of the resort) and it was interesting and worth a visit. Overall, an excellent resort. Prepare for a fabulous time and the Princess Bavaro is a beautiful resort.

<Content>Hepatitis scare We stayed in Bavaro Princess Hotel the last week of January 2005. We've been in Punta Cana before and loved it, so this time we just wanted to try different hotel. Well, everything was great: the room, the food, the service, and, of course, the beach! We told everyone how much we liked the place! Three weeks later my husband fell ill and was diagnosed with Hepatitis A, - the liver disease that gets transmitted mainly through food and water. He's been in the hospital, and still recovering now, lost a month at work. Doctors suspected that he could have got this while on vacation in Punta Cana, but I doubted that, remembering how clean the restaurants in the hotel looked. Yesterday we got a phone call from couple we know who stayed in the same hotel in Punta Cana a week before us. To our horror, they said that the husband was also diagnosed with Hepatitis A! Now all my doubts are gone. Tourists can not control the food preparation process, if the hotel staff don't do their job.Too bad.

<Content>Excellent Vacation March 19-26 After reading some of the negative reviews people had left about this resort I was a bit hesitant about going on vacation here. What can I say. The resort is beautiful. The beach is beautiful. The service is fantastic. The people were some of the most friendliest people I have ever met. The food was great and yes, you can drink the water that is served to you in the restaurants. I went down with my two daughters, ages 15 and 12 and the three of us had the vacation of a lifetime. I had concerns going down as a single woman with two girls but we had absolutely no problems or worries and were treated like princesses the whole time. My daughters met tons of kids from all over the world that they have continued to keep in touch with. We went swimming with the dolphins which was overpriced. We went on a trip where we swam with sharks and stingrays booked through the resort and that was well worth your buck. We are already planning when we can go back to the Bavaro Princess and would not ever think of going anywhere else. The entertainment team does a great job getting everyone up and motivated or if you would rather be left alone there is plenty of places to do that as well. I would highly recommend this resort for families, single parents, and couples.

<Content>Had a great time! Our family of 2 adults and 2 children(9 and 12) stayed at this resort from March 19th - 26th. We have traveled quite a bit, Costa Rica, Maui, Baja, Barbados, St. Lucia, Aruba, and the Bahamas in the last couple of years. As far as bang for the buck I don't think we have beat the Bavaro Princess. We paid $1690 land only for the four of us and felt that we got a great vacation for the money.  Everything went very smoothly,transfers,check-in, dinner reservations, checkout,and VIP features. The rooms are even nicer then they look on the hotel web-site. The king size bed was comfortable, our daughter slept on the hide-a-bed couch(not so comfortable) and they brought in a twin bed for our son with-out being asked. The room was very clean and the maid service twice a day was very consistent. Try to get a room near the beach/pool to minimize your walking. (I emailed ahead, never got a response but the room was just as requested-2nd floor, king, near beach.) Everything is marble and slick--watch the stairs in the middle of the night between the bed and bath. There is a free safe in the room to store lots of $1 bills you should bring for tips and purchases. My daughter got bug bites but not the rest of us. We ate in every resturant expect for the main buffet for dinner. The main was good for lunch and we liked Chopin for breakfast. A few items were bad(very few), most were good and some were very good. We ate and drank everything and we did not have any illness. My husband was in love with the mussels in the buffett. The only resturant we didn't care for was Pescador. Gaucho(great steak and flaming fruit) and Bella Pasta were our favorites. We never had trouble getting reservations, but I did do them 2 days ahead on my morning walk at 9am. I did wonder if late risers and non vip got what they wanted. The fancy-no kid dinner at Licey's was good and romantic. (some people did bring thir kids) but I would not pay an extra $50 for it. Just use it if you do the VIP. Beach, pool and swim up bar are great. Order a blue thing for me from the cute swim up bartender and give him a good tip! Most of the staff is wonderful, they all have such a great attitude. We didn't do many activites but they are plentiful. Water sports were quiet because of an Easter shut-down. If you do the VIP make sure you do your massages and snorkling trip. The kids liked the shows at night and wouldn't miss them. They ranged from so-so to very good. It's tough with so many languages to do comedy!  In conclusion we found all the good comments to be true and did not experience any of the bad comments I have read on other reviews. I would not have any hesitations in reccomending the Bavaro Princess to any one looking for a large all-inclusive beach vacation at a great price.

<Content>Going back in April and can't wait! This review is a bit dated since we stayed at the Bavaro Princess from 1/27-1/30, but I am returning with my family on 4/20, and that made me want to offer details on such an endorsement. The resort, the staff, the room, the amenities and even the food exceeded our expectations on our first stay, which we discovered was much too short (4 days).Resort Highlights 鈥?We had the VIP package (and we're getting it again) so I can鈥檛 say for sure how much that influenced our experience, but the staff was absolutely one of the best and most enjoyable parts of the resort. It is true that many/most of the service staff (waiters, bartenders, housekeepers and the legions of other support personnel who make the resort run) do not speak English, but the ones who really count (front desk, concierge, dive instructor) do. We are calm and easygoing by nature, but we found that they bent over backwards to make sure everything was exactly the way it should be for our stay. When we explained how short our stay was we managed to get reservations at the restaurants that were 鈥渙fficially鈥?booked for that night. True, the time was not ideal, but we were accommodated in this and other situations. Rita (the VIP concierge) is the epitome of grace and service, and sets a tone of service and accommodation that we found among the staff throughout the resort. As posted elsewhere, doing your best to reply 鈥済racias鈥?and 鈥減or favor鈥?is graciously appreciated since you are, after all, visiting a Spanish-speaking country. Tipping is also appreciated and remembered, as it would be at any 5-star resort.Resort Drawbacks 鈥?The only real drawback was the sheer size of the resort, which requires a bit of time to navigate for making reservations, having meals, and attending the mandatory 鈥渙rientation鈥?with the tour company (definite low point of the trip). Maybe with a longer stay we wouldn鈥檛 have minded this so much.Room Highlights 鈥?We upgraded to the VIP w/oceanview, and we definitely got what we paid for. We were in the first row of buildings from the beach (buildings 1 and 2, and I believe also 3 and 4). As we had read here, it seems that all rooms are the same (except that some have king beds and others have two twin beds), but they are truly 鈥渕ini-suites鈥?and they are wonderful. Very spacious (even the bathroom), nicely appointed (we enjoyed the ceiling fan over the bed), and functional (the fridge/mini-bar adds to convenience and enjoyment.)Room Drawbacks 鈥?I can only think of one, and we remedied that right away. The hairdryer had this odd way of shutting down and then starting up again inexplicably. We thought it was overheating, and then I thought to check the plug (over the mirror, somewhat hidden). Sure enough, it was a loose connection at the plug, which with a little coaxing I was able to secure well enough to eliminate the problem. If this is the kind of inconvenience that will cause you to downgrade a resort from 5-star to 4-star then you should reconsider the Dominican Republic as a destination. It is not Bermuda or Aruba or even Barbados when it comes to service and amenities, because it is still a work 鈥渋n progress鈥? But we were amazed at how hard they were trying and how close they came to these world-class vacation destinations.It is worth mentioning that the comments about water pressure and temperature at this resort have some merit, but nothing that interfered with our enjoyment of the trip. We found that by letting the water run some, it warmed enough to be enjoyable (but it was never a steaming 鈥渉ot鈥?shower.) And the pressure is probably not be what you are used to, but we found it perfectly acceptable. Had I not read the comments of others here I would not have even thought to mention it.Food Highlights 鈥揑 was expecting a bit of a 鈥渃attle call鈥?environment for dining, especially in the buffet restaurants, but we were never in a 鈥渢hrong鈥?of people, or in a line for food or a table of any significance. Maybe that was because we were there mid-week, so it was less crowded? We only got to try La Hispaniola (the buffet in the main lobby) and El Gaucho (the steakhouse on the beach which is also where they serve lunch), and Licey (the gourmet restaurant requiring an 鈥渦pgrade鈥?, along with the snackbar for a burger. Overall we were very pleased with the variety and the quality of the food, even though it was quite different from what we are used to. But even less adventurous eaters should be satisfied with the variety of delicious breads, fruits and deserts, as well as the chicken which was very good. We never ate any pasta, but then we are adventurous eaters. Based on the food I鈥檓 not sure I would recommend Licey for the extra $$, (it was included in our VIP package) but it was definitely worth it if you are looking for an elegant, romantic meal.Food Drawbacks 鈥?The food is not 鈥淎merican鈥?by a long shot, although there are several offerings clearly aimed at our eating traditions (hot dogs, French fries, chicken). The ketchup was awful! The beef (except hamburgers) was all spiced in the local tradition which might be a problem for anyone who didn鈥檛 care for it.I鈥檓 surprised I haven鈥檛 read anything about the coffee 鈥?or lack of coffee! They have these abominable Nescafe machines that seem to lack the most basic of choices 鈥?鈥渞egular鈥?coffee! Of course decaf was out of the question, but there is a coffee maker in room room (with ordinary ground coffee provided) and this time we'll bring our own decaf! We would have liked to have breakfast near the beach, but breakfast was served from 7-10 a.m. at the main lobby restaurant (Hispaniola) which is a 鈥渢rek鈥?away from the beach. There is breakfast/brunch at El Gaucho (on the beach) starting at 10 a.m., but for us this was not an ideal time to eat breakfast. Mentioning such a silly small issue just about sums up how little there is to complain about!I hope the weather is better this time than when we went in January, but then no resort can guarantee that! But we know first hand that even with mediocre weather the beach and the rest of this resort is simply fabulous.

<Content>Uno, Dos, Tres, Aplauso!!! Just got back on March 28th after spending 2 weeks with hubby and 2 kids (9 yr old girl  8 yr old boy) IT WAS EXCELLENT! Going the VIP route is a good idea: it solves the waiting in line for restaurant reservation stuff since you can do it by phone or stop at the VIP concierge desk close to the pool. It's nice not to have to run after beach towels, and you get to use their bathrobes, get one hour free internet per week per adult, a free 20 minute massage per week per adult, and same for snorkling. We thought it was a nice upgrade! If you are there for a week, plan your excursions and massages soon after arrival. You cannot make reservations for restaurants more than 48 hrs in advance, so don't delay too much: Your first meal wil be at the Hispaniola (Main building Buffet) because you still haven't made reservations...but that's still good. Try Breakfast at the Chopin or if you sleep in, grab a croissant  fresh fruit at the Trapiche building by the beach. COFFEE IS EXCELLENT!!! but you can only get it in the evenings after your meal at the main bar or in your room (or at the LICEY restaurant if you went VIP and it is your turn to eat there).The animation staff are great - a lot to keep your kids busy and out of the sun during peek sunshine hours, especially the first few days (Bella at the Kids Club is a sweet heart, and ALL the kids love her) and enough eye candy to keep mom interested... Their evening entertainment is great: Mini disco and games for kids while Mom  Dad have a drink in the main lobby and watch from a distance, and lots of stuff happening during the day in the pool area and the beach to keep teenagers and adults busy, and laughing!Their 10 o-clock shows feature good dancers and enough to keep Dad interested also...If you are going to take an excursion, try the BAVARO RUNNER - there's something there for everyone, and bring a bathing suit and towel - you can swim in a pool after lunch and you finish the day at a beach. Our kids loved it, and we enjoyed it also. It's one good way of learning something about how the Dominicans actuallly live!We definitely will be going back. It's true, a lot of the staff is not fluent in English, but they try hard, and so the language was not really an issue. Like anywhere else you go, treat people with respect, and they will treat you the same...

<Content>The good and the bad of Bavaro Princess Hotel This is a very nice resort and I would recommend it to anybody.But some these tips may help you to have even a better time than we did:If you like boogie boarding (and the waves are awesome), please understand that you will first be told that boogie boards are not available(maybe in a week), even though the store next to the water sports' shed sells them for $20. Next, you need to convince the water sports' manager that you will complain to the hotel mamnagement if they don't give you the equipment. Magically, the boogie boards are suddenly available, although the manager will still be hesitant and very unpleasent about letting you use what you paid for with your all-inclusive package. The food is nice, as long as you avoid the buffet but eat whatever the cooks are preparing fresh in the respective restaurants. Avoid fresh lettuce and other non-peeled vegies. I did get sick for one day after bravely trying a fresh salad. I was very careful otherwise so I think it was it. Cipro became quite handy on that day...The non-VIP wine is unacceptable, so if you are a wine drinker, go with the VIP package. The beeer is fine if you like a light lager. They do not have any of the decent darker beers that real beer lover would appreciate--but again, there are other drink choices and I guess you are supposed to drink rum in the Caribean! I recommend kai pirina.And please do not drink the tap water as advised by one of the previous posters--they were probably just lucky or drank enough of the free booze to kill the germs :-) Even the locals do not drink tap or well water--they collect rain water and still purify it with chlorine tablets.There are some mosquitos--just use the deet spray before going to dinner. It is worth enjoying the outdoors in the evening. We were family of 4 and up to now (3 weeks since our return) none of us came down with malaria (we have not taken any pills). My wife did get a few bites.The trams are nice, walks are also enjoyable and help you burn the inevitable excess of calories.Most of the staff are nice and deserve tips鈥攚e spent $5-10 per day, especially if the service was exceptionally good. Take some small gifts for children of your maid as well.If you are planning tours I recommend the Monster truck. It鈥檚 very educational for those who are interested in learning a little bit about the culture. Bring along gifts for children if you can. Coloring books and playing cars seemed to be most desirable based on the level of excitement. The Marinarium tour (swimming with sharks) is also nice.As you book your tours and bus ride back to the airport, ask your agent three times (or more) to enusre that they have actually scheduled your ride/tour. We had some problems with this and saw others desparately trying to make their flight or missing it because of screw-ups of this sort (our Punta Cana operator was VIP tours, not related to the VIP package).All in all, enjoy your time. It is is a nice resort.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel for Family Vacation I have just returned from a week long family vacation at the Bavaro Princess (March 17 to 24, 2005). We had a wonderful vacation and would definitely return.I read all the reviews before I went and was extremely concerned about the quality of the premises and the whether or not we were all going to get sick. My concerns were completely unfounded. I have decided that maybe I should stop reading the reviews.I have traveled to the Carribean 30 plus times in the last 15 years to many different islands and I can say that the Bavaro Princess was the cleanest resort that I have ever stayed at.I was extremely impressed with the facilities. The beach was awesome. My 5 year old son loved the pool. For those of you that don't like children around the pool there is a second pool behind the lobby that is lacking in action.The tram/trolley system worked very well and we never had to wait more than about 3 or 4 minutes.I would describe the food as good but not fabulous. The selection and variety was however, unbelievable. All the restaurants were clean and the staff very friendly. If you try to speak a little spanish they really appreciate it. The system for reservations for dinner worked very well for us. We simply accepted the fact that the first full day and night that we were there we were going to have to eat at Hispanola (a buffet restaurant) and thereafter made reservations at the a la carte restaurants a day in advance. It worked well for us though we did not get a chance to try El Piscador (the seafood restaurant).I was also impressed that they enforced the dress code for dinner. I am of the opinion that this adds class and style to any resort.I expect the we will return to the Bavaro Princess next year for another awesome week of fun in the sun.

<Content>Never Again First and foremost, a resort that requires that you brush your teeth with bottled water cannot rate 5 stars. 4 of the 8 of us had gastric nightmares during our stay. The food is mediocre at best and it can make you ill as we found out. We ate carefully and used antiseptic wipes whenever possible. Our efforts were not rewarded. This was not a vacation. This was like some weird version of a gastric survivor show. On the positive side, the Dominican staff at the resort could not have been nicer. It's too bad that the sanitary conditions undo their goodwill.

<Content>Good time I went to the Bavaro Princess March 12-16 and had a great time. The staff was pleasant and helpful, however it does help if you know some spanish since not all staff spoke english. The entertainment staff was great, they provided you with lots of activities and put on some fun shows on at night. The room was clean and roomy and nice cleaning staff. The restaurants book up easily so go early, the food was ok and plentiful. Know how to make your favorite drink, not all bartenders know how to make all drinks except Juan in the main lobby-great bartender. The property and beach was beautiful, had fun parasailing. Would definitely go back.

<Content>Excellent Hotel! I can't believe the N.J. folks complaints about the Bavaro! First of all, the trams come every couple of minutes! I guess if you live in New York state, that might seem like a long time. The tram service was excellent. Just make sure if you use it after midnite ,to wait infront of the Hotel. The resort was beautiful and exceptionally clean. I went with my family of 4. We just returned today and had a GREAT time. We all drank the water, ate the food, and even brushed our teeth with the regular unbottled water and none of us were ill. As far as the N.J. people commenting that they didn't get purified water, Well it was the ONLY water that was served. The suites were very lovely and spacious.We enjoyed all the restaurants. They even had lobster tails on the seafood buffet at the Hispinoila! I love seafood,so El Pescador was my favourite rest. I had the garlic shrimps and grilled lobster.VERY good. EL GOUCHO is great for the steak lovers. Try the Argentian steak.The beach is amazing! Warm turquois water beckoning youto jump in. There is a lot of Spanish speaking people there, but what do you expect? That is their first language! It's easy to get by, even if you only speak English. They are eager to try to communicate. I think because this has only been a tourist spot for a relatively short period of time, English language speaking staff will likely be encouraged in the future. The only thing I didn't like was having to make Restaurant reservations in early morning. I like to sleep in as I please, but in order to reserve at a good restaurant, you had to do so by about 9:00am most days. All in all, I loved Dominican and the Bavaro Princess. I met lots of people there and didn't hear one complaint! I think some people who complain of diarhea, have likely enjoyed too much of the free booze. After all, if you drink a lot of liquor, you'll get loose, no matter what Country you're in!Try the Casino, it's fair and not overcrowded. Bring lots of sunscreen, it's easy to burn there. We were there for a week. It didn't rain even once. Beautiful warm weather-30+ celcius or about 90degrees farenheight every day. Have fun, and don't hesitate to choose this beautiful resort!

<Content>Very Nice Resort Travelled with a group of 30 people - 50th Wedding Anniversary - Adults and Children ranging from 2 - 18 years old. We were also VIP.Check in - Very busy, however, considering they were checking in 600 hundred people on that day (March 12, 2005) it went fairly well. Long line ups, but this is to be expected on March Break. We arrived at around noon and couldn't get our room until 3pm. We had anticipated this and packed our bathing suits in our carry ons, so we changed and headed to the pool where we also got some lunch.Rooms: By 3pm our rooms were ready and our bags sent down. Nice spacious rooms with a sitting area, as well as a little kitchen area. The bathroom is set up nicely with a separate area with a closet and mirror with vanity. Lighting in the bathroom isn't the greatest, but not bad. The bed was fairly comfortable. We had a king size bed and a single cot brought in for our 7 year old. However she didn't want to sleep on the cot by herself, as the king bed is up a couple of steps from the sitting area where the cot was put. The balcony was very nice and had two big comfy chairs and a table on it. Water pressure is weak, however, we always had hot water. There was a bit of smell by the water treatment plant around building 19 and 20 - you may not want a room by there. We were in building 77 - very good location, close to pool and beach.Restaurants: Bella Pasta - very good - lots of pasta - open at lunch with a buffet with pizza everyone seemed to love. El Gaucho - pretty good steakhouse. Chopin - buffet, pretty much the same as the lobby buffet, but because it is an a la carte you are getting much better service. Sakura - didn't go. Liceys - had the ox and it was very good, it was like a piece of prime rib, however, if I wouldn't have had VIP and a free meal, I wouldn't have wanted to pay $25.00 to go eat there. Main Buffet in Lobby - was always a good variety, pasta bar very good, different international themes on different nights. Pecsador - didn't go. Mac Princess - hamburgers, hot dogs and french fries all day long. You can only book your a la cartes up to 1 day prior to your reservation. I recommend booking the day before you want to go, not on the day, as the times are fairly limited if you book for the same day. But we did go at peak time, so it may not be an issue for others.Massage: Nice treat and free with the VIP. More like a rub down with oil.Pool: Great pool with lots of different areas. Good areas for little children to wade and play in. Also nice area for pool sports. Swim up bar was a little chilly, as you are in the shade, so we didn't sit there for long.Markets: Be prepared for some very aggressive sales people. Offer them a third of what they ask for.Beach: The beach was beautiful, white, soft sand that stretched for miles. The water was warm and the kids and adults had a ball in the waves. Book your snorkeling on your first day there, as the times fill up fast. We reserved chairs by 7am or you may have a hard time finding shade on the beach. Same at the pool. They have signed posted saying you can't reserve chairs, but everybody still did.Service: Always service with a smile. Very good service.Ground: Beautiful ground with a little area with swans, flamingos, peacocks, ducks. Our daughter had fun feeding them with bread. Also little area with Parrots and Iguanas and different caged birds.Mosquitos: I was very surprised after reading other reviews, but, there was a lot of mosquitos. Had I known there would be that many, I may have reconsidered not taking the Malaria pills. We chose not to, relying on the may reviews we read. There were always a couple in the room every night and from 7:30pm to 10pm or so, we could not sit out on our balcony without swatting them away. Also up at the main buffet in the lobby (open air restaurant) they were biting at our ankles during dinner.Shows: We only went to one show on our last night - The Lion King - and it was very good. We were pleasantly surprised, as we had gone to Mexico last year and the show here was far superior to the shows we had seen there.Out of our group of 30 people about three of us got sick (myself included - I lost a full day).In summary, we really enjoyed the resort. It is very clean, nice plants, trees, flowers, etc. Room were nice, pool great, beach great. However, I don't think I would go back - just because of the size of the resort. I found it a little too big. The shuttles frequently come by, but I just found it really to stretched out from the main building (lobby) to the main pool - beach area.Have a great holiday - don't worry - it is a really nice resort - you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Montezuma's Revenge We spent the first week of March at the Bavaro Princess - two couples celebrating our 25th wedding anniversaries. Needless to say we were looking forward to a special holiday. We have travelled to the Caribbean on other occasions so were prepared for the language, foods and differences in cultures. What we were not prepared for was Montezumas Revenge which all four of us suffered from for most of the week. This seemed to be a common ailment among many of the resort guests the week we were there. The rooms were spectacular. always clean and welcoming. The beach was by far the best we have encountered - 30 miles of uninterrupted white sand - with warm water. We never had to head to the beach early in order to get a chair - even after lunch we always found shade at the pool. However it was a week of modest eating and drinking as we questioned what was causing our health problems. We only drank the water provided by the resort. cleaned our teeth with bottled water and did not eat salads or unpeeled fruits. The resort was beautiful but unfortunately we were ready to leave when the week was over and do not plan to return to the Dominican Republic. ( especially this resort)

<Content>Amazing Vacation! My girlfriend and I are in our early 20's and we would generally visit the big party spring break locations. The past two years however we have been seeking out places that are more laid back and slightly family oriented, but still fun and with plenty of activities at our disposal. We found the Bavaro Princess to be exactly what we where looking for. I have decided to list my comments on this location and property below separately.The Bavaro Princess Property:The Princess is a very large property. It has a fairly large stretch of private beach for its guests that is watched over by numerous security personnel. There are lots of topless women and men in dental floss or speedos. The property is situated in a way in which it stretches deeper into the land than over beach area. Don't get me wrong though the beach is still very big and very, very beautiful. This is to enclose all the suites, restaurants, pools, bars, pathways, courtyards, bird sanctuary, lobby, theater, and casino. The restaurants and bars a strategically placed all about the property where as you can access a beverage or food almost 24 hours a day. Most all surfaces are made of polished stone, polished coral, coral, and marble. I would not say that they are the cleanest property you will ever find. But on a scale of 1 to 100 I would give them a 95. As in clean I mean sweeping and dusting and picking up trash. They have an enormous staff and a enormous property. My only guess is that they did the best they could do, because I saw people walking around literally 24 hours a day 7 days a week cleaning. There was never a moment that I did not see some one cleaning or serving a guest. I am an adventurous type and I love to venture off the property when I go to other countries and barter with the people, but I only did it a couple of times because there is just so much to do on this property.The Room:All the rooms are suites at this property. They do have a few junior suites, but I truly don't know who stays there. It wasn't even offered as an option when I booked my trip. All the suites are located on the beach area of the property, and the farthest room would only take minutes to walk to the beach. All suites are situated inside the property and no one truly has a beach front property. Granted there is a few rooms that face the beach, but at the end of the day those rooms where no better than anyone else's. The rooms are very spacious. They have a sitting area, a mini bar with a table and four chairs, a fridge that is restocked daily with coke, diet coke, beer, and a gallon of water. The beds are firm. We where VIP so we had beach towels and robes in our room, as well as turn downs service which is just stupid. The Food  Beverage:Let me just say first off that if you are hungry they have food. You have access to food 24 hours a day 7 days a week. The room service is great if you are VIP. My girlfriend and I left the casino on Sunday morning at 2:30 and we where starving. So we went to Bella Pasta and they had a buffet full of pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs, french fries, ect. It was awesome. The food is good and bad. I can not give a general rating of the food over all. Because there where some things that I loved and some that I hated. It just came down to preference. They have pretty much anything you could want. The drinks are at an abundance. Once again you can drink 24 hours a day 7 days a week. The banana milk shakes are AMAZING as long as you have the right bar hand make it; most will do a good job but their where a few that had now clue. Also there is this tall guy at the lobby bar and I wish I could remember his name, but he is always smiling and nice and he will make you some amazing shots if you ask him.The Hotel Staff:Most can speak a little or a lot of English. Spanish is their first language and you are in their country. They do the best they can and love it when you try to speak what spanish you may know to them. They cater to people all around the world and many of them speak four or five languages. Don't get frustrated you can find someone to help you if you need someone to converse with extensively. By the way Americans make up the smallest number of tourists to this country; ratio wise. Look at it this way: If a German, French, and Spanish tourist came to your place of business would you be able to talk to them and make them happy? They appreciate a tip, a smile, or a pat on the back and will bend over backwards for you. One night I need a particular item at 1 in the morning and the stores where closed. I went to the front desk and asked for their help and they had a guy go into the city and buy it for me and did not even ask for anything in return! I was astounded! That was above and beyond.The Shows:The shows where probably one of the best things this hotel had to offer. I did not think I would be that interested in the shows, but they are very entertaining and fun. We never missed a show the entire time we where there. They work very had to make the shows as quality as they can and the staff that put the shows on never sleep. If they are not doing the shows at night, then they are organizing activates at the pool all day or walking around entertaining guest. They truly enjoy their jobs and work hard.Activates:They have snorkeling, windsurfing, body boarding, deep sea fishing, you name it. I would suggest you talk to your tour company while you are down there or someone's tour company and book the JUGLE SAFARI. It was amazing and we had a wonderful time. We had an opportunity to get to know the people and learn about their culture, history, and way of life. Hopefully you will get Elvis and Miko they are great and Elvis is very knowledgeable and funny and he speaks very good English, Spanish, French, and some German. We won $300 US over all at the Casino. Super!In conclusion remember where you are and what you are there for. In the end they have done all that they can do to make your trip as fun as possible, because without you they would have nothing. It is up to you to make the best of whatever happens and make the trip as enjoyable as possible. It is a once in a life time opportunity!

<Content>Wonderful Resort I just got back from the Bavaro Princess and I had the BEST time. We stayed for six nights, and wished we could have stayed longer!Check in was very easy and simple it only took us a couple minutes. After check in the tram brought our luggage and us to our villa. The property is just amazing, very clean and big. We were in Builidng 36 and that was right by the pool and about a 2 minute walk to the beach. I would definitly recommend getting the VIP package, we received free room service and better room location. The food was good obviously different from back home but we didn't get sick from eating it. The room was very clean and roomy, our cleaning lady was great. Many people on the staff spoke English, so that was not a problem, we actually had fun trying to speak to them in Spanish! The staff was exceptional they will bend over backwards to help you, very pleasant to be around. The beach was amazing, the water was alittle cool, but after you got use to it it was very refreshing. The weather was great, it was sunny the whole week no need for a jacket at night (unless you were in the casino) Mosquitos were also not a problem, we only saw a couple the whole time we were there. We also went on a coulple excusrions (I would definitly recommend the Helicopter ride) and from what we saw picking up people from different hotels, the Bavaro Princess definilty looked the nicest. Overall we had the best time, if I do return to Punta Cana, I will definitly be staying at the Bavaro Princess

<Content>Worst Vacation Ever!!! Just returned from Punta Cana and what a disappointment!! First, if you can鈥檛 speak Spanish go somewhere else...only about 2% of the staff spoke some English. If you do go do not waste your money on VIP..what a joke. Everything was booked. When I tried to use our free snorkeling trip pass three days before we left it was booked, no one told us to go the first day we got there and make arrangements. We saw people who were not even VIP with Beachfront rooms and we were not. There miniature golf course if even funnier.. I wish I had a picture of it... Most importantly the FOOD! Oh my God it was the worst food ever.. We were prepared for it to be bad after reading some reviews but it was GROSS. It would sit out all day so I started to just eat bread but that was even stale. I went with 5 other people, everyone got sick.. Three of them had chills and were sweating profusely. They didn鈥檛 even give you bottled water in your room or at all the bars except the lobby bar. We spent half the vacation waiting for the trams to bring you places since the place is so big...they only had about three running and they wouldn鈥檛 move till they were filled up. I am sorry if this offends anyone but I wish I had believed the few other reviewers that had felt the same way. I have traveled a lot and this was the worst vacation I have ever been on. If anyone has any questions just ask鈥?br/>

<Content>loved it, and I m fussy... week of December 17th o 24/2004check in...My husband ,my two daughters(ages 6 and 18)and myself arrived at this resort in the late evening. check in was fast...Our room was smack in the middle and we loved it...the set up is great, though it was quite humid when we got there it took a whole 24 hours to get rid of the humidity, I guess they turned the a/c on just before we entered the room..we had no hot water from the time we got there till two days before we left, it was just warm, but we managed fine...We did not even mention it to the front desk,other rooms were the same and some people changed because of it... the cleaning lady did a very good job, and would leave us whatever we asked with a few hand signs and a dictionary we were able to communicate. We did leave her tips and gifts every day which she seemed to appreciate.We were a little overwhelmed with the size of the resort I thought I would be lost all week, but we were just fine in finding everything the day after..You could tell that the hurricane had hit them, but they worked fast to get things up and going.They were building the beach restaurant and it was amazing on how fast they worked , it opened for us on the Monday night ..We did take the precautions for the Malaria thing, but we did not see any bugs while we were there , they did fumegate in the evening along the passway...Food...We all thought the food to be pretty good and the service was always with a smile and nice conversation, they tried hard to speak English and we knew a few spanish words, so we got along fine...Pool..The pool was alot of fun and very nicely set up but we are beach people and that is where we spent most of our days..The beach what can I say , it is amazing, There is enough to keep everybody busy, my 18 yr old had fun joining the organized activities and my 6 yr old played in the sun with her new friends, we did not use the kids club in the day , but in the evening she would go on stage and do the little dance and games they had every night for the kids, she loved it ..The dance shows with costumes were very nice.We would relax in the gorgeous lobby after supper with a few drinks in hand, all the furniture seemed to be new there, it was very beautiful..I would return to this resort in a minute , but I also like to see new places, this is my second best spot the first being the Iberostar Hacienda Dominicus in bayahibe(Dom.Rep)I did not give this resort a five star due to the hot water issue, but really it did not ruin my week whatsoever..hats up to the Bavaro Princess...If you have any questions just put Bavaro Princess in subject and I will gladly try to help you....

<Content>Sooooo great!! My husband and I returned from our 2 week honeymoon at the Bavaro Princess on February 22. We had such a great time. We have absolutly nothing bad or critical to say about this resort. Everything was perfect, from the food, to the rooms, to the wonderful staff, to the beauty of the grounds, to the extra activities offered, to the beach. I'm sure we would have enjoyed the resort equally as much even if we were not vip, but the perks of being vip were great. We loved the massage, so much so that for our second one we paid to get 25 more minuts. If you travel with an open mind and with someone you love, you're bound to have the time of your life like we did. The conculsion we came to about the negative reviews on this site was that the people who wrote them must be difficult people to please, and have a hard time thinking optomistically. We would highly recommend this resort to anyone and we would go back in a heart beat!

<Content>Great place We were at the Bavaro Princess from Feb 13 to 20th. FLIGHT: We travelled with Air Canada Vacations, so we were on an Air Canada flight . The flight was uneventful. Typical Air Canada service.CHECK-IN: Check-In was very quick and painless. We checked in with a very small group at 10:00pm. English was spoken and the front desk staff were efficient and professional. The welcome drink at check-in was a nice touch . ROOMS: The rooms were wonderful. We were in 075, which was close to the main pool and beach. It was very quiet with the exception of pool aerobics time from 4:00 to 5:00pm, when the pool noise carried.RESORT: theresort is big but we found we could walk most anywhere in under 10 minutes, with our nine year old in tow. The trams seemed to be frequent but we never found the need to use one other then at check in.BEACH: The each is beautiful and we had no problems getting beach chairs or shade. There were days when it was quite breezy though.FOOD: We ate everything and were fine. Here is a break down of our experiences at the restaurants: Hispanolia - Breakfast, lunch and supper buffet. It was good, lots of varieties, and the pasta bar here was amazing! Chopin - Best breakfast spot. The supper buffet was also beautiful and service excellent. Sakura - Did not eat here as our 9 year old is not a sushi fan.El Gaucho - This is the steakhouse.This was an awesome restaurant. My husband's steak was incredible. My kabobs superb. Service was excellentEl Pescador - This is the seafood place. We didn't have a great meal here as the service was terrible - very disorganized. But that can happen anywhere!Licey - This was another wonderful restaurant. It was included with our Vip package. We had yet another excellent experience here with the food and service.Bella Pasta - This was one of our favorites for lunch and supper. Great service, great food!McPrincess - Yummy fries.VIP: VIP is definitely worth it. This includes a 20 minute massage, bottle of rum and 3 cigars in the room, use of bath robes during stay and best of all ROOM SERVICE. The room service came in very handy with our 9 year old, who due to time change was not always awake before breakfast closed. It was fast fresh and wonderful.OVERALL: We found the staff here incredibly polite and professional. They always accommodated my daughter with kid's choices. The resort was immaculate. We were VERY impressed and would highly recommend Bavaro Princess.

<Content>Amazing Beach, comfortable resort BAVARO PRINCESSALL SUITE, ALL-INCLUSIVE RESORTCHECK-IN: A disaster! We arrived on an Apple Vacation Charter at 11:30 am. Check-in was 3pm, NOT A MINUTE SOONER! There was no effort made to make us at all comfortable. This is where we first learned that there was going to be a language barrier. If you do not speak spanish, this may not be the resort for you. We booked their special VIP Package that was to include many perks and special treatment. NOT!When we finally received our key at 3:01 pm we were not guided to our room, but pointed in the direction of a tram and left to our own devices. This is a huge 96 acre beautiful tropical resort with 90 buildings, we had to find our own way around to our room.ROOM (Suite): Very interesting layout, and very comfortable. Patio has 2 chairs and a table. Sofa and chair near TV, table and 4 chairs in front of bar. Separated, elevated king bed (hard as a brick, Marriott should take lessons here). Closets and bath area down a separate hall, and they took the design from the cruise lines, very effectively. All of the electric utilities are wired through a device that if your room key is not placed in, the lights do not work.Un fortunalely when we were unpacking and exploring the room we had to call housekeeping to replace 3 light bulbs and I needed to fix the cable connection for the TV. Language was again a barrier. Our room was about a 3 minute walk from the beach and restaurant areas around the pool and a 10 minute walk to the main building lobby and restaurant. Trams ran every few minutes and were very accessible.RESTAURANTS: The main lobby restaurant is the Buffet, open all three meals each day with varying menu items. We had breakfast there each day (we didn't find out till after we left that there was another breakfast choice, Chopin was apparently open for breakfast and lunch, but not listed anywhere!) Breakfast choices were aple and varied. Many were unknown in the American diet. We never went for lunch. Dinner the first night featured mystery meat. My wife found that the pasta bar was phenomenal!There are 4 specialty restaurants and 1 gourmet. Reservations are required for each. If you don't make your reservation BEFORE you arrive, which is not offered, you may not get there for a few nights. I do not understand the resevation system. One restaurant seats 100. They only accept 60 reservations at each of 3 seatings each night. This made no sense to me at all. We were told that if all the people came at each seating it would be bad! Not enough staff? The dinners are geared towards the European diet and culture. The dinners are the smallest meals of the day. The dinner menu in all but the gourmet restaurant had the entree only. No appetizer, salad or sides were offered. We got smart and ordered like on a cruise...we wanted some of this, that and oh yeah, the other plate as well. The gourmet restaurant was 3 courses and an extra fee of $25 pp, except it was included in the VIP. Nice and romatic setting. The lunches at the restaurant near the beach and at the grill were excellent, if you stayed with basics, except...stay away from the hot dogs! They are deep fried with the french fries!BEACH: PHENOMENAL!!!!POOL: The main pool is huge, and very easy to spend the entire day.With both the pool and the beach, get out early with your towel and book and stake out your palapa. We had massages poolside in a hut, very relaxing. We used the Water Sports team for the snorkel trip. $17pp, except that ours was n/c with the VIP, we also had a 20 minute teaser massage on the house as well.Every day was nicer than the one before, weatherwise.NIGHT LIFE/ ENTERTAINMENT: There was a disco, we didn't go. There was an evening show, all in Spanish, we didn't stay. There is a new casino just outside the gate. We visited one evening, it is your basic small casino.WRAP-UP: We enjoyed our time at the resort. It was clean, the people were friendly (more English would have been better) and the tropical gardens and areas were very relaxing and beautiful. We wish that more info had been available so that we would not have had to reinvent the wheel for each and every thing that the resort had to offer. I am sure that there were ammenities that we never experienced, because the info was not readily available. We would visit again, but probably not in the near term. We would want to visit another property and see what they have to offer.

<Content>Had a great time. Going back in 2006. Here's the low down on the Princess. Go VIP - this way you don't really have to worry about anything. I was here January 2005. Hotel: The resort is well maintained. You would never guess that a Hurricane just came through a few months ago. We also felt very safe. They have security posted all over - you barely know that they are there. With the breezes coming off the ocean we slept with the door open. Staff: The staff is great, very freindly. It does help to know the language or travel with someone that does. The only major problems with language was with the cleaning staff but you can easily work that out. The wait staff is great. I've never seen staff so energetic. They can make you feel better even if you have a hangover. Just leave your trash on the table and it's gone in seconds. No need to feel guilty. Not sure what to order (food or drink) they will recommend something. Rooms: The rooms are small but open, so if you are traveling with friends or couples, get your own room. We had a oceanview  i wouldn't trade that for the world. The view was great. Bring your own wash cloths - they don't provide any. Food: I was a little disappointed with the food, not the restaurants themselves. I would have liked to have a selection of local cuisine for dinner at least one night. See the concierge to make dinner reservations as soon as you get there. We selected a different restaurant for each night. You can always change it if you want. The dress is casual and the men must wear pants. Ladies we can wear walking shorts.Clothes: Optional. Well, at least on the beach. I guess that's the European influence. It's wasn't that bad so put your tongue back in your mouth. :)I recommend a bathing suit a day, 2 casual outfits or short sets for the day  something for dinner. It gets cool at night so a light jacket is recommended. Currency: They deal in US$ or Pesos. You don't really have to change your $$ but know what the exchange rate is. Bring small bills if you are going to shop wither in the stores across the street or when you go out. It is easier to bargain. Also easier to tip. Speaking of tips, the atmasphere doesn't really support it but just put it in there hands or leave it on the bar. The staff really does appreciate it. Excursions: Make your reservations early  plan your week. If you are going 4-wheeling bring a bandana/scarf (for the dust), a bottle of water, water shoes would be best for your feet and if you really want to have fun, wear clothes you don't want to keep(I wasn't call the mud queen for nothing). Well i think thats a mouth full but worth it. Hope this was helpfull for someone. See you January 2006!!!!!!!

<Content>Very Good Value Review of Bavaro Princess Hotel, Punta Cana February 21, 2005Introduction: My wife and I were at the Bavaro Princess from Feb 5-12, 2005. Like other readers, I felt obligated to write this review, since I had frequently read reviews before our trip. Perspective: We have read many reviews and oftentimes have wondered what type of travel experience the writer has. To offer you perspective on us (not bragging), I have traveled internationally for many years, with numerous trips to England, France, Germany, Greece, Russia, China, Singapore, Dubai, Korea, Taiwan, Sweden, Scotland, etc. On vacations, my wife have been to Hawaii three times, Acapulco twice, Cancun, Cozumel, and at least seven Caribbean islands, usually for 1 week each (i.e. not for a day on a cruise). We typically have not stayed at all-inclusives, since I get hotel price reductions for ones I stay at on business (Hyatt, Marriott, Hilton, Westin, Sheraton). Hotel Selection: I asked our AAA travel agent to give me prices for all the 5 and 6 Apple hotels on Punta Cana. Because I value the dollar, I narrowed the list down to 4 hotels that seemed to have good facilities, numerous ala carte restaurants and good pricing. The hotels were: Princess, Grand Palladium, Catalonia Bavaro, and the Iberostar. The latter hotel is a few hundred more US Dollars than the others. When I looked at some of the six Apple hotels, some were 50-80% more expensive. So, I thought it was worth taking a chance on the 5 stars. We chose the Princess for several reasons: 5 ala cartes and 2 buffets, generally good reviews on Tripadvisor (although this was highly variable), suite room, and could upgrade for reasonable $ to VIP.From what we read, we thought it was worth the $91 per person for the upgrade to VIP for these reasons: better chance at getting a good room near the beach, can book all the ala cart restaurants the first day you are there with the special VIP concierge (rather than waiting in line at the main lobby in the morning to book only the current night and the next one), free room service (which we never used), free scuba dive for one person, free snorkeling trip per person, beach towels in the room, 20 minute massage, premium brand drinks (Stolichnaya vodka, Tangueray gin, Grand Marnier, etc.), and free meal at the gourmet restaurant, Licey鈥檚. See their website below for a complete description of VIP benefits. Flight: I used US Air frequent flier miles, so we only bought a land only package.Land Transfer to Hotel: This went smooth. The Apple rep was readily available, no problems. As we expected, the ride to the hotel was on some rough roads, with plenty of poverty to see along the way. This is fairly typical of other islands. The entrance to the Princess was very nice. The hotel system for when you arrive is a little screwy, but tolerable. The bellman takes your bags off the van, and then sets them on the sidewalk and they tell you to go register. The lobby is so big, it is not obvious where check-in is located, and being untrustful, my wife didn鈥檛 want to leave our bags unattended. We found check-in and they gave us baggage tags, then went back to the bag area, gave the bellman our tags to put on our bags. He spoke a little English and said they would be delivered to our room. We stumbled around to find the way walking towards our room, asking several hotel people, and they said to take the tram, which we did. Check-in: We had read some bad things about the front-desk, but our experience was very good. I had asked for a non-smoking King on the second floor, near the beach, and that is exactly what we got---Room 343, which was the second building from the beach, facing the pool, and only steps from lots of things. Hotel Layout: Other reviewers have commented about the shear enormity of the hotel, but until you see it, you don鈥檛 realize just how spread out it is. There are two main areas with rooms----1) near the main lobby---there is a good size pool there, the spa is nearby, and so is the main Buffet restaurant鈥擫a Hispaniola, Licey鈥檚, and the lobby bar. Then there is a large marsh waste area (they call it an ecological area) and 2) then another set of bungalows closer to the beach. The walk from the beach to the main lobby is 0.5 miles (we clocked it on our GPS), but the trams run frequently. Since we tend to be more beach people, we would not have liked having a room near the lobby, even though you can ride the tram. Even some of the bungalows near the marsh area are a good hike to the beach. By the way, walking doesn鈥檛 bother us, since we walk at least 5 miles per day at home or on vacation. Near the beach are the main pool, and three restaurants---Gaucho, Belle Pasta, and Pescador, as well as McPrincess鈥攖he hamburger and snack place.Room: Our room was just as depicted in the photos at their website (princesshotelsandresorts.com/bavaro/index). The sliding door in the closet didn鈥檛 work, but other than that the room was good- lots of room, good satelliteTV, very nice lanai, no bugs, A/C worked fine, good safe. The beds were firm but tolerable. We tipped the maid $2 every day and she changed the sheets, restocked our fridge, etc. With VIP you also get nightly turn down service and fresh towels, and they only missed doing this twice. RestaurantsBreakfast---although not readily advertised, you can get breakfast at Chopin, and Gaucho, in addition to Hispaniola. Not many people seemed to know about Chopin, so it was not busy at all. They had eggs cooked to order, and a large variety of meats, fruits, made to order smoothies, etc. Very good.Lunch---available at Belle Pasta, Gaucho, McPrincess, and Hispaniola buffet. We weren鈥檛 fans of Belle Pasta鈥攖hey had made to order pasta sauce and ingredients, but there were less ingredients than a similar station at Hispaniola. Gaucho had grilled steaks, porkchops, fish, sausages, and you could always find something that was good (not great, but acceptable). Hispaniola seemed to vary their selection each day. You could get made to order grilled steaks, chicken, fish, sausage and burgers. Steaks were very thin. like most of the meats, and small but tasty. Dinners---a)Pescador------ate there twice. I ordered the garlic shrimp appetizer, spicey lobster stew, and then the grilled lobster. I thought it was very good, but my wife accidentally ate some of the dark stuff in the lobster and didn鈥檛 like it after that. b)Gaucho---ate there once, and should have tried it again. I had the Argentinian barbeque and it had 5 types of meats鈥攙ery good. My wife had a steak and it was good.c)Belle Pasta---ate there once, and wouldn鈥檛 go back. The service was extremely slow, our food didn鈥檛 taste good, and it was cold when it arrived. d)Chopin----we never tried their 鈥済ourmet鈥?buffet, but from others we talked to, it was Hispaniola under candlelight, so really nothing special they said.e)Sakura---this was our favorite. Ate their twice. Highly recommend it.f)Licey鈥檚-----food was good but not necessarily gourmet. Portions were very small. Atmosphere was excellent, and so was service. Worth trying if free, but not worth paying extra for. g)Hispaniola----we never ate dinner there but looked at what they had a couple of times just to compare. Seemed to vary somewhat from night to night. h)Generala.Ala carte places always seemed half empty at the 8:30 seating when we were there. Not sure why they won鈥檛 take last minute reservations. b.We went at 7:30P for an 8:30P reservation and had no problem. But then we were late for a 7:00p reservation by 50 minutes and they almost wouldn鈥檛 seat us. He said they had 80 people coming at 8:30p. We left at 8:50 and only saw 4 people come into Pescador at 8:30Pc.Overall, food was more than acceptable, except for Belle Pasta at dinner. Tipping: We tipped about 5 to 10% of what we estimated the meal would have cost, depending on service, etc. We judged the meal costs based on the room service pricing. We didn鈥檛 see many people tipping for any meals. We also tipped some of the bartenders who we saw more often, or who made us martinis, etc. We brought $125 in one dollar bills and went through most of it for meals, bellboys, etc. Beach: As others had noted, the beach was excellent. No problem getting chairs, but was tougher by the main pool to get a chair after lunch. We walked as far as 3 miles in either direction from the hotel. There are local beach front shops about 1 mile in either direction, selling essentially the same stuff. If you go to one, go into the alleyway behind and there are many more shops in the second row. Yes, there were many topless woman, but I certainly didn鈥檛 mind looking at many (not all) of them. Shows: after dinner we would go to the Lobby bar to have a cocktail, watch the people, and watch some of the start of the shows. The lobby really is a great place. We only saw limited parts of the shows since I got sleepy and wanted to go back to the room. Selling of Princess Memberships: When exiting the Hispaniola one morning after breakfast, a Princess rep said he saw we were VIP and wanted to give us a chance to save 40% on future bookings by going directly with Princess rather than through an agent. I asked him several times to make sure there was nothing being sold, and he said no. If we just went with him to the service center, they would give us a package with how to book direct. So, we got suckered and walked with him to the center next to the Licey restaurant. When we walked in, it looked like a timeshare or other sales set-up. We listened to the pitch for only a few minutes, and said we get the picture, but what do the memberships cost. He had to call his boss, and his boss wouldn鈥檛 tell us since we had not heard the whole story. We politely excused ourselves and left. We don鈥檛 know if these memberships are good or not, but did not want to spend 45 minutes to hear the pitch. Bugs and Illness: Based on reviews, we brought bug repellent with us. For the entire trip, we saw only two houseflies, and one wasp. Never saw a mosquito, but we took the malaria medication just in case, and also took along a prescription antibiotic, just in case. We were both fine health-wise. Snacks: Based on other tips, we brought peanuts, cashews, etc in ziplock bags. While we ate some, we brought most of it back home. I guess we ate enough at mealtime. If you like snacks or things like that, there aren鈥檛 any available unless you buy them in the gift shop for lots of $;.Activities: we are both certified scuba divers and planned to dive two or three days. Unfortunately, the wind was very strong for the first 4 days and no one was diving, and there were very little water sports going on at all. So, we just walked the beach, ate, drank, and relaxed鈥攓uite tolerable. On our fifth day there, we went deep sea fishing in the morning ($91 per person) through the charter that Apple recommended. It was excellent service, especially the first mate Jose. There were six of us fishing. We hooked up four lines at the same time about 30 minutes after dropping the lines in the water, and then later got two more. They were all Mahi-Mahi which were fun to catch. The rest of the half day we only had one more bite, but that is fishing. With VIP we got one free snorkel trip in the boat. It was windy and visibility was poor but we did it anyway. The reef was pretty chewed up, but still was fun. The next day we went diving, but due to the weather, they only took us in 22 feet of water, and not much visibility, but better than nothing. Scuba Caribe from the Princess does not take you in a platform dive boat. They use a regular boat and it is not easy to climb back in. There were other platform boats around, not sure what happened to us. Also, they would not give us a break for a two tank dive. Two tanks pricing was one dive times two, which is unusual. We also took the hobie cat out for a spin. There were naturally plenty of other things to do like beach volleyball, aerobics, etc.Other Hotels: Our son is leaving this week for Punta Cana to stay at the Grand Palladium (used to be the Fiesta). So, we walked around that hotel to see what it was like. Very comparable to the Princess it seemed. We also walked in the Iberostars and in Paradisus. It seemed all the hotels were extremely deep from the beach, so not sure if the size of the Princess is that much different. The bungalow style is different than a high rise hotel, that鈥檚 for sure. Overall: Would we go back to Punta Cana? Probably not in February. From what we learned, it is not unusual to have strong winds in the winter from the north. The temperature was great鈥攈ighs in the high 70鈥檚 and low 80鈥檚. But it was tough to do water sports. Also, Punta Cana is on the Atlantic, not the Caribbean. If we go back to the DR, we would likely try LaRomana on the southern coast where it is supposedly much calmer in the winter. If we did go back to Punta Cana, would we stay at the Princess? Definitely yes, if we could be assured of having a room somewhat close to the beach. It was a good value, good service overall. We might try the Iberostar if we go back, since we heard the food was better there. But, that is a tough thing to judge.

<Content>Highly recomended!! After reading some of the negative reviews that were posted here, I was a bit worried that my vacation would be less than satisfactory, but having arrived back this past Sunday, my only regret is that I didn't book 2 weeks. The grounds were beautiful, food was excellent and the staff was very freindly and helpful. I will definitely return for the 2 weeks next year.

<Content>tainted by illness, otherwise pretty good We just returned from our stay at the Bavaro Princess and have some rather mixed feelings about this hotel. We were there from feb. 12-19.The Good:The check-in was easy, no problems there. All the staff we dealt with were very kind and helpful. The beach is fabulous, plenty of chairs and coco trees.The rooms are great, the maid service is good.The animals they keep on site are fabulous and we really enjoyed walking through the bird sanctuary and feeding the ducks in the pond.The Not-so-good:The food was at best average, and sometimes pretty bad. One or two things were delicious but the rest did not impress us.There was no bottled water available, except for the gallon we had in the mini fridge of our room. We were not about to drag that around with us all day so we bought some smaller sized bottled water in the resort store. It cost us 14 dollars US for a total of 2 litres (2 X 0.5 L and 1 X 1L) We thought that was a little extreme! The shower was pityful. There was but a weak trickle from a decrepid shower head and it took a long time to take a decent shower at any time of day or night...The Terrible:Illness: I became ill on our third night there. At 3:00 am, I got sick with nausea and diarrhea. I took Immodium immediately and that helped, but the nausea stayed with me for 5 days.My husband was not so lucky...24 hours later, he was severely ill. I won't disgust you with the details, suffice to say he left the maid what must have been the biggest tip of her life and humbly apologized to her about the mess in the washroom. We did what we could to clean it up ourselves, but we did not have the proper supplies. That stayed with him for the rest of our trip. We were both afraid to eat anything after that.Others were sick too, but we still can't figure out if it was from food poisoning or if it was another outbreak of the gastro illness we had heard about from a previous Health Canada Warning. All I can say was that we took all of the proper precautions advised to us from the Health Canada web site and still got sick.I suppose had we not been ill, we may not have had negative feelings toward the resort. However, we both agreed we would not likely return.

<Content>beautiful I'm 13 years old and i think the hotel is great. the food is fantastic aspecially the argantinian steakhouse. you should try arg... bbq steak. but you should never ever order the flaming fruit ice cream for desert the decor is great but the taste is aughful i actually threw up after that. The room service is great except that they come at 2:00pm for me thats late. The enviorment is great when i came in the main lobby there were ducks and flamingos!! For me that was a rare site.Back to the food there is a asian restuarant named Sakura the food is horrible i have this feeling that they had frozen salmon roll. French fries imean liberty fries were amazing they were organic. The pool is shallow 4 1/2 feet topps itwas good for me becuase it had a bar that you swim up to get a drink. i advice you to get a spanish dictionary. the beach has white sand and most of the people there are french, german, spanish, (as from spain),and Italians. Not many Americans.hope this review really helps,M

<Content>Loved it! I thought a review from an English holidaymaker might make a change:-We had a week at the Bavaro Princess from 4th - 11th February and thought it was wonderful - would have liked to stay longer.Can't understand the criticism of the food, which we thought was excellent, with a very good choice, especially as I am completely vegetarian - there was always plenty for me to choose. The rooms, too, we thought were amongst the best we've had anywhere. The hotel is set in beautiful grounds, the villas nicely spaced and everything very well set out. We had a walk of 5 -10 minutes to the beach, through lovely quiet lush grounds which we enjoyed - never bothered getting on the little train. Beach and sea were beautiful, swimming pool was lovely. The only one point made by previous reviewers which we have some sympathy with, was that the reservation system for booking restaurants other than the Hispaniola was a bit daft. Maybe they needed to know numbers, to allocate enough staff each night to each restaurant, but it was perhaps too rigidly enforced. Apart from this, we're at a loss to understand some of the criticisms made by others. All I can say is you must be too used to luxury! This was our first time in the Caribbean. We've had holidays in Europe, particularly Greece, where some of the reviewers on this site would probably have fainted in horror if they thought this was bad!!

<Content>Great Holiday My wife and I spent two weeks at the Bavaro Princess All Suites (Jan. 17-31), our second time in three years. We have travelled extensively throughout Central, South America and the Carribean and Punta Cana has certainly one of nicest beaches you will see anywhere. The Bavaro Princess All Suites is the third resort we have stayed at in Punta Cana and really quite impressive in terms of the resort's layout, lush gardens and the quality of the rooms. The first stay here was for 11 days and this second time for 14. Both visits were excellent. I am always amused in reading the comments of travellers, particularly in the context of their expectations. Folks, this is a third world country and you need to go with the flow. At the Bavaro Princess All Suites I have seen considerable improvement in service since the last time we stayed there. They are always cleaning the property and cleaning common areas and washrooms. The staff are friendly and helpful. Yes, it is always the luck of the draw in terms of which room you are assigned but if you ask them politely they most often try to accommodate you. We also found the food to be quite acceptable, even after two weeks. Definitely a place that I would not hesitate to return for a third time.

<Content>Somewhat disappointing My husband and I spent 5 days at the Princess with our two grandsons (ages 6 and 4).   CHECK-IN: We arrived around dinnertime on Monday evening and checked in rather quickly.   ROOM: Our grandsons loved the room. They thought it was especially neat to have to use the key to use the lights. The room was located very close to the main pool and the only drawback with staying in a hotel so large, is we had to use the tram car to get back up to the main building all the time.  FOOD: The food was a bit of a disappointment. Since we arrived late the first evening, we didn't have a reservation anywhere and even though the restaurants weren't crowded, we had to eat at the Hispaniola because that is the only restaurant that doesn't require a reservation. The food and service at Bella Pasta was good, but we were very disappointed at the service in El Pescador. We waited over a half hour for our food, while other people were being served within ten minutes. We were just getting ready to leave when our food came. Unfortunately with two small boys, waiting is very difficult. Breakfast at Hispaniola and Chopin were good. We wound up eating the rest of our meals at Hispaniola and that got boring fast.  SICKNESS: My younger grandson developed a rash on the second day we were there. When we attempted to find the doctor (according to the map), we had a major problem. After going back and forth from where the doctor was supposed to be and the lobby for over a half-hour, my husband was standing at the front of the hotel ready to scream when a very nice man stopped and took us to the doctor's office. They had temporarily moved her office to a hotel room, but unfortunately no one in the main lobby had a clue where she was. After examining our grandson, the doctor gave us three kinds of medicine, told us to keep him out of the sun that day, and sent us on our way, telling us to come back the next day to check him again. Although the doctor was extremely nice and helpful, we were somewhat surprised that it cost us $148 for that little venture.  WEATHER: The weather was in the mid-80's while we were there. It rained on and off every day and because we had youngsters, we would run back to our room instead of waiting it out in the bar or just staying in the rain. I loved the ocean, but the boys and my husband spent most of the time in the pool. Of course the last day turned out to be the nicest day of all so after we checked out, we spent our last few hours playing in the pool by the main lobby and that turned out to be the best time of all.   I love the tropics and this is the second time I've been to Punta Cana, but I don't think I will return to the Princess again.

<Content>Wonderful first traveling experience We stayed at the Bavaro Princess from Jan 13, 2005 through to Jan 27, 2005. We got married at the hotel on Jan 17, 2005 and I have nothing but great things to say about Gabriel (the wedding coordinator) and our beach location. We had 12 people make the trip with us and besides having a few small communication problems with the staff (I can speak a little bit of Spanish), our overall experience was a good one. I found the staff to be helpful, courteous and willing to teach you a few key phrases in Spanish if you attempted to speak a little to them. You have to keep in mind that you are visiting a country different from your own and so be prepared to have some language difficulties and some other small problems (we got locked out of our rooms a few times and had to make the trek back to the lobby to have our room cards reactived) but nothing that we didn't have corrected with the front office staff apologizes. This was our first trip outside of Canada and the United States and really we were pretty happy with everything, we even found the food to be not bad, most of us agree that the Sakura(Japanese), El Gaucho (SteakHouse) and the Bella Pasta(Italian) were a good spot for supper. I forgot to return the surveys when we were at the hotel, so I plan on filling them out and mailing them off so that they know that Gabriel bent over backwards to make our wedding a special one and it was!

<Content>Great except for the food My husband and I just spent 5 days at the Princess and had a great time overall except for the food. Here is a summation:CHECK-IN: We had no problems. We arrived around 3:30 on a Tuesday, and did not have to wait in line (we were VIP, otherwise there was a line with about 4 people). The man helping us spoke good English, although the first one didn't, he just got the attention of the man that did.ROOM: We loved the room. We were the second villa from the beach,and although we didn't pay for beachfront, we could see the beach some. We looked a map and requested a room by giving several numbers of villas and ended up getting one of the ones we requested. We loved how spacious the room was. A little bar, a sitting area, a desk, a small kitchen table, step-up into the bed, and then a bathroom with seperate room for toilet, shower and bidet. The deck was great to sit out on and have breakfast, a drink, etc. We saw a lot of people enjoying theirs as well. One of the biggest rooms we have ever stayed in. WEATHER: I know they can't control the weather, but we were very surprised how windy it was the majority of time we were there. We met someone who said it is better weather this time of the year on the south side of the island. Because of the wind, we did not even venture into the ocean and spent most of our sun-time at the pool.POOL: We spent most of our pool-time lounging by the main pool. We never had a problem finding a chair. It was nice that they did not have blaring music. They did start music and dancing by the pool around 3 or so. FOOD - OVERALL: We were very disappointed with the food. This would be the reason we would never return to the princess. Things tended to be left out too long and cold things made warm, hot things made room temperature. More details follow:BREAKFAST: They do not tell you Chopin has breakfast, and it was supposedly less crowded than Hispaniola, but we only ate at the latter twice. The smoothies are good, and you are willing to stand in line, the omolets are good, if a little greasy. I missed bagels and a good selection of fresh fruit. Again, much of the food was left out too long... The cheese was mushy, etc. LUNCH: Fried hotdogs from MacPrincess were not good. The fries there were undercooked and soggy. They were out of burgers several days, and I think I got a spam sandwich instead of a ham sandwich. After this we found bella pasta, which became our lunch mainstay. I waited for them to pull fresh pizza out of the oven, and my husband had pasta. Every day.DINNER: Licey was excellent service, but the oxen tasted like a Quincy's cheap steak, and the mere (some type of fish) was very tough. The wine here was better than elsewhere. I would not pay extra for this restaurant. Pescaudor: All the shellfish we encountered at princess was mushy, not much texture, which just felt gross to eat. The lobster here was no exception. Bella Pasta was our favorite, then Sakura (if you like Asian), then Gaucho - decent steaks there.SICKNESS: We met so many people who had gotten sick. I met a man who was with a group of 24, and he said almost all of them had gotten sick at some point. I was SUPER careful - brushing my teeth with bottled water, not eating any fruits or vegetables that could have been rinsed in non-purifield water unless they were cooked or peeled, not eating much seafood, and definitely not the more suspect ones (oysters, squid, etc), and I still got sick. I brought antibiotics with me since the last time I was in Mexico I had gotten sick, and saved myself $145 from the dr. visit that someone I met had to make to get some antibiotics to combat this.PEOPLE: The staff was great. That was a true highlight of the trip. VEry friendly, extremely hard-working, and very appreciative of any tip. Yes, it's all-inclusive, but showing appreciation for their hard work with a few bucks here and there doesn't hurt us, and goes a long way for them.DRINKS: Missed my Bacardi and Bud LIght, but enjoyed the frozen drinks. NEver had to ask more alcohol! VIP: For us this was worth it for the following reasons. We got to make all our dinner reservations on the day we got there. You do get better liquor, but several bartenders would let anyone have it. It depended on the server. Room service was a big bonus. Especially after some of the dinners that we did not like. Having a room closer to the main pool was also a nice bonus. We forgot to do our massage, but heard it was great. Email me at cindijunk@yahoo.com for any specific questions.

<Author>Proud-Canadian
<Content>Best Vacation Ever We just returned from the Bavaro Princess All-Suites Resort on February 5. There were 13 of us on this trip and all are in agreement that we would return if ever going to the DR again. We ranged in ages from 7 - 80 years of age.BEACH - out of this world. The water is light green and there is nothing but very fine white sand. The seaweed is raked each morning by the staff. The waves were quite high at times but this is what made swimming in the ocean so much fun. The water was very refreshing (temperature just right). The resort was running at full capacity and we never had a problem getting a chair. They do not allow reserving a chair with a towel and have a very large sign posted stating this. We never went to the beach before 11:00 a.m. and had no problem getting a spot.SECURITY - felt very safe. Security guards on the beach 24 hours a day. When we were out walking at night along the beach and then came up to go to our resort - we were always stopped and had our bracelets checked. The rooms have a very large safe (key) and it held all our personal documents, cameras, etc.POOL - the pool area was huge and beautiful; however, I never went in the pool because I prefer to swim in the ocean. Lots of topless women in all shapes and sizes. Personally, I think women look much more attractive when they have a bathing suit top on (my husband disagrees) ha ha.TOURISTS - there were a lot of different nationalities present. Lots of Canadians/Americans, many Europeans. I read in previous reviews that the Europeans are pushy and rude and butted in front of people waiting to get on the tram. I did find some truth to that but I just ignored it. I especially noticed it at the beach bbq area and the bars. It didn't happen that often though. The Canadians are by far the most friendly (Of course, I am Canadian). They love to go up to other tourists and strike up conversations and they are very appreciative of the hard working staff. Anytime we heard complaints about the resort it was from Americans. I am not saying that all the Americans complained; however, anytime someone complained to us or (we overheard their conversation) they were from the U.S. One American tourist stated that he hated the food and that the food in Mexico was much better because they had all the American fast food chains along the strip. We are not in the United States, so why would you expect them to have American Food.??????????FOOD - 3 out of 5 stars. Mostly buffet style. The A-la cartes were very good, especially El Gaucho. The T-bone steak was delicious. The omlettes made in front of you were very good and also the pasta made to your order was very good. I found that the food at the buffets was cold by the time you sat down and it was very bland. There was so much to choose from - even choices for picky eaters (like myself). Of course I missed food the way I prepare it at home but you have to remember you are in another country and why should they cater to your tastes. I did find a lot of the food greasy. They deep-fry everything. All in all, we did not starve and possibly gained a few pounds. Oh by the way the coffee is very good.SICKNESS - My niece was sick after eating seafood at Liceys. We are sure that it was not food poisoning but we think that the sauce was so rich and she is not used to eating fish like that. She vomited once about 1/2 hour after eating the fish and then she was fine. No one else was sick. A couple of us got too much sun and were a little queezy because of that. We brought our little hand sanitizers with us to each meal and we all remained healthy. Don't worry.WEATHER - beautiful. A couple of days were cloudy and very windy. These were days when everyone avoided the beach and headed to the pool. Most day were sunny and warm. I found that if I sat under a cabanna I was well shaded but I got cold very fast. There was a steady breeze and the water was rough (lots of waves) but we loved it and only swam in the ocean. Sometimes the waves would carry us onto the beach. The kids had a great time swimming in the ocean and very rarely went in the pool.SHOPPING - lots of shopping on the beach (1/2 hour walk heading east) there is a plaza at the entrance to the resort (across from the casino) and there is also the hotel lobby. Bring lots of snacks with you because I paid $7 U.S. for a big bag of Doritos. We got some good deals. Make sure you barter. We found that we were always being asked if we were Canadian or American. I guess they could tell we weren't European by our white/white skin. We asked one guy why he always says Canadian or American and he told us that he had different prices for Americans vs Canadians. He told me that he doubles the prices for the Americans. Sorry to our American neighbours but I'm just relaying what he told me. He quoted me $7 for a t-shirt and I overheard him telling an American that it was $15. My advice - tell them you are Canadian.All in all, this is a beautiful resort. The grounds are immaculate and the staff are very friendly and hard-working. they appreciate you trying to speak spanish and they try to speak English. We never had problems with the language barrier. There were plenty of staff that spoke English very well. We never had problems with the front desk and we had plenty of hot water. Our fridge was stocked daily with beer, pop and water. If they forgot to stock something, we just called them and it was delivered later in the day. We did not tip the maid every day but we did tip her very well on our last day. We tipped the wait staff every night at dinner and we would make sure we didn't leave anyone out. We even tipped the guy sweeping the floor. We had a fabulous trip, no one was disappointed and if I was to visit the DR again I would definitely book at the Bavaro Princess. I hope this review helps you and I hope I did not offend any of my American neighbours.

<Content>Bavaro Princess is a winner We spent 7 days 1/21/05-1/28/05 through Apple vacations , Bavaro beach area is lovely with a bunch of large hotel complexes 100 + acres along the shore. All of the hotels are low profile so it has a very spacious feel, there is nothing worth seeing off campus unless you are prepapred fpr a long bus ride 4 hours to santo domingo the old capital. Outside the hotel is a newish mall but it contains tourist rubbish at twice the prices of the hotel gift shops, even after the usual bartering dance. The hotel complex is very nice the rooms are 4 to a floor in a two level building with a nice balcony and spacious rooms. The beach is lovely as is the pool with lots of room and plenty of loungers. There are multiple evening meal choices outside the hispanolia buffet room, all require reseravtions altho I am not sure why, they were always plenty of tables. The gourmet restaurant Licey included in the VIP package was OK, although it was bit over the top and empty. We spurlged on a decent bottle of red after getting fed up with the spanish vino tinto during the week. We enjoyed the breakfast and lunch buffets, the beach bar burgers and fries were wonderfull, we had realistic expectations for dinners so were not disappointed, if in doubt there were always perfectly acceptable pasta bars in all restaurants. English is not commonly spoken by all staff, but pidgin spanish, a smile and a dollar bill opens all doors. We tipped the chamber maid and requested extra water and hangers, I tipped the Hispanalio staff in advance as we sat in the same area most days, that way I ensured a steady flow of vino tinto, coffee etc, a dollar a day goes a long way! All in all a nice experience if you want to veg on the beach, we did not go the casino, but the shows in the lobby were entertaining and a good place to people watch . I understand that the beaches on the La Romano side of the island are as nice with a calmer ocean so might try that side in the future . I am happy to offer comments to future travellers. PS the Apple on site rep natasha was very good and gave good advice, dont miss the orientation.

<Content>THE WORST FROM BEGINNING TO END Okay, But some problems would be an understatement! Six of us just reutrned 1//29/05 from the Bavaro Princess Hotel  Resort ( We were by the way V.I.P. Customers) Which meant nothing except they gave us more of a run around. There staff is helpful but doesn't understand english  the management team is rude.The front desk manager tried to help us but he just couldn't get anything done,.we were suppose to ask for Irene Bastista if we had any problems and we did ask for her every day and everyone but no one had ever heard of her. here is a summary of our stay at the Bavaro Princess, we arrived on Monday at 9:30 p.m. We watched the bus that brought us from the airport drive away as we were standing in line at the front desk(get use to standing in line at The Bavaro )waiting for someone or something to help you. We had been delayed two days because of a snow storm in Boston. So we didn't arrive till Monday night which was disappointing , but had made up our minds to have the most fun we could in the time we had left..Wrong agin. Then when it was our turn to talk to the front desk they said our room were cancelled as of Saturday because we didn't show up, we explain to them about the storm and that T.N.T. must of notified them. They ageed they had but we still did not have any rooms there. Well after a little undertaking they found us three rooms ( not the accomidations we had booked but three rooms) and said they would help us in the morning. Then they told us to go to the information desk to get our all inclusive bracelets which we did. ( Not knowing the color , we thought they were V.I.P. braclet, because that was what we paid for and was on our reservations). One of the guys in our party tried to get a drink at the bar that night and was told we didn't have that plan. So the next morning when we saw the T.N.T rep. we asked him an he said they were the wrong color for V.I.P. ( so back to the desk we go) wait in line and after re-checking our reservation that we had to present they gave us a new bracelet. After which we asked them about our changeing rooms an no one knew anything about it an said we'd have to talk to the front desk manager Angel, and that he'd be back in an hour or so. We waited an finally talked to him ( he was the most helpful of anyone there) an he told us we couldn't stay in the same building as we had requested but he would move us , so we agreed. That same evening one of the couples we were traveling with T.V went down (like the cable when out) at full volume, they tried to call us but said our phone didn't work to see if our cable had gone out. When they couldn't get hold of us and the third couple we were traveling with said theirs was fine he walked to the front desk and reported it ,they told him someone would be down to fix it right away...p.s. no one came so he found the breaker an shut it off (as of Saturday when we left it had not been fixed) we reported our phone out the next morning and as of Saturday when we left we still had no phone. ( we couldn't make plans with the two couples we were with unless we walked to their suites) each and everytime. To wrap this up , we have traveled a lot and this is the worst vacation we have ever had, the beaches were beautiful, the grounds were beautiful, but the hotel  management staff was just plain terrible. We would not recommend this hotel to anyone, I know that it is suppose to be one of best but it isn't..Everytime you ask for your extras ( massage, rest. resevration  etc.) you were told you had to book them three days in advance. If you can add you'd understand that if we lost three days because of the snow we only had four full days and one 1/2 day left , so three days in advance was a little heavy. The new casino was a joke(we go to Las Vegas twice a year) and when I tell you 2 out of 10 slot machines worked that is correct, but they were going to get fixed soon, ya ok! If your still planning on going to the Bavaro Princess we wish you the best of luck. We would return to the Dominican Republic but never to a Bavaro Hotel. We plan on sending The Bavaro Princess questionaire to the home office in Spain with this same information on it.

<Content>Great resort! My husband and I just arrived home from our 7 night stay at the bavaro Princess resort! We loved this resort it was much more than we expected- it was the cleanest resort we have ever been too- I do not think we saw one peice of trash- tthe workers work all day and night and they work harder than anyone- please tip the people who serve you - they really do appreciate it when you try to speak spanish- if you don't understand just smile - as long as your friendly they will do their best to help you-WE loved to take bread and bannanas from the buffet in the a.m and go and feed the birds- the scarlet macaws loved the bannana we brought them every a.m.- the beach was the best it was clean- and plenty of chairs- we never got to the beach before 11:00 and we always had plenty of chairs to sit under.Just remember you are not at home- my husband is a very picky eater and did not care for any of the food-except the steak house and bella pasta- I am a vegatarian and there was not a whole lot for me to eat either if food is real important to you and your picky- keep this in mind- the food is all good quality and a large selection- but not american- and I knew this from other reviews and I was still disappointed- if you like salads bring small packets of dressing from home- and the menus at the alacarte restaurants are in many languages but there is no descriptions of what the food is so as avegatarian it was hard to order- Bella pasta was my favorite- we found out 2 days before we left that you could go there for lunch- it was real good-we went Vip so we could order free room service which we did alot- the rom service food seemed to be much better-I ordered in spanish(just did the best I could prononcing everything) and our order was always right- Bring lots of snacks from home- we brought some wished we would have brought more!As far as VIP goes- our room was 133 kind of in the middle- I saw people with blue wristbands- not VIP who had rooms by the beach and by the pool- so who knows if you really do get a better room location- we did eat at liceys and it was the worst- if you have to pay to eat here do not- if you get to go for free- then eat at the buffet first-  The entertainment was the best we have seen at a resort- they were great- I did not expect to want to watch the showevery night but we did - they were great- these people are fantastic! They do have budweiser beer- you have to ask for a bottle and they will poor it in a cup we found this our the night before we left- we were both tired of the presedente- and we heard a guy order it and so on our last night there we enjoyed a budweiser- WE walked everywhere- it was nice- there is a jacuzzi in the spa we used one day when it rained I would recommend it! There is shopping accross from the resort and if you walk both ways on the beach but they are very aggressive! I enjoy bardering but not there- I have been to mexico, jamaica, and the bahammas- and it was fun to shop but the venders want outrageous prices so don't give in!I really loved this resort and the dominican people- remember to smile be friendly and to tip the people for there hard work- the same people will serve breakfast ,lunch and dinner, then they will work in the entertainment or tend bar- 15- hr days they work! Go with a open mind we were glad we stayed at this resort compared to the others we walked by on the beach! ours was by far the nicest!If there are any specific questions you can email me at sammyreggie@new.rr.com

<Content>Not that great.... My trip to the Bavaro Princess was terrible, I have been to the Dominican 3 years in a row and stayed at the sister hotel (Caribe Club) so thought I would try this hotel. First of all, there was no hot water at all and we were there for seven days!!!!! Seocndally, they gave us a promotional 100$ royal dollars to cash in for the Casino--very good promotion, however to cash it you need to attend a meeting. It would be good if they explain this because I brought it to the casino and they didn't know what to do with it and then the hotel lobby told me I had to attend the meeting--I am on vacation and don't have time to attend meetings, I just want to have fun!!!! Lastly, the service at the information desk is only spanis, I understand that is there main tongue, however, it is a resort with several tourists, having them be bilingual would be more of an asset...especially since it is the information desk?!? I do not plan to go back to this specific resort.

<Content>Can't Wait To Go Back!! The next time I go to the Dominican Republic I WILL be staying at the Bavaro Princess. We left from Calgary on Jan 6/05 - Jan 13/05 via Sky Service. Excellent flight both ways. Good food, friendly staff and showed 2 movies each way with a 30 minute interlude of I Love Lucy and The Beverly Hillbillies.We arrived quite late at the resort and were quite hungry. The friendly staff quickly checked us in .. and bumped us up to VIP for nothing!! At the time we didn't realize what a 'great' benefit VIP would provide! But were so grateful we had been when our vacation was over, I will definately spend the money and go VIP next time. After our quick check in, we jumped on a tram (like a golf cart with more seating) and the bellman took us right to our room. We got settled in and took a look at our resort map to find the MacPrincess was just a 2 minute walk away .. so that we could get some food into us. We waited for about 1/2 hour for the little buffet to open .. but enjoyed a few drinks while we waited!! We found the buffet to be very good. Very western. Beef burgers or Chicken burgers with Fries. As much as you wanted!! The seasoning they used was amazing. We found it to be very good .. hit the spot for sure.VIP - I would recommend getting this. Totally worth the extra money. We were bumped up for free .. for some reason, but were so glad we were. The perks: Free introduction to snorkeling, Free 20 minute massage by the pool, Rum and Cigars in our room, Free Internet Service, Bathrobes, Evening refresher of towels ect. (the maid would come in and change our towels and restock pop again). Could make all of our reservations at the beginning of the week with the conciere at all 7 of the a'la carte restaurants, Excellent location of room, the good liquor and any cocktail and how ever many you wished at all of the bars (some guests who weren't VIP had to pay for some of the cocktails on the list and didn't get the 'good' Rum or whatever your preference is)Room - Our room was 443 (2nd floor). Very central. We were very pleased. And found the 2nd floor very private. Whether we were out on the balcony or just changing in the room. Very quite room. Clean and everything worked. The phone was a bit staticy but we only used it twice. We also left our cleaning lady a dollar tip everyday and she kept our fridge stocked full of pop, beer and water. She would also take note of what we were drinking more of and would leave extra's of that kind for us. A very very kind woman. Didn't speak a word of English but very kind and polite in her actions. We ended up leaving many items for her when we left (suitcase could only weight 40 kilos) like shampoo's, hairsprays etc. These people work very very hard and do not make very much money, so anything we could leave we did. ** to note: your suitcase can only weigh 40 kilos in the Punta Cana airport when your heading for home. For every Kilo extra is $5 US. We were told that our carry-on could only weigh 10 kilos, which we found to be false. They didn't weigh the carry-on so at the airport we loaded up our carry-on's to lighten up the suitcases. (remember all of your clothes will be damp because of the extreme humidity, so this will increase the weight a great deal)Tram - We were in such a central location and the weather was so nice that it was kind of nice to walk from one place to the next. And if a tram happened to go by and you wanted to jump on you just had to wave at the guy and he would gladly stop. The grounds are very very beautiful. And at night everything is uplite and there are nice walking lights all along the paths which really makes you feel like you are in paradise. During the day the staff were working very hard planting things that were damaged from the Hurricanes to bring the resort back on its feet. But honestly we weren't bothered at all. You really wouldn't notice many storms went through there. Beach and Pool - We found that there were always a lot of people around the pool but we hung out on the beach mostly. Depending on the weather the number of people on the beach varied. But even on the busiest days we never ever had a problem finding numerous lounger beds on the beach. And lots of spaces under the thatched umbrellas they had. The beach is huge and was always very clean (compaired to other resorts we saw) We felt very lucky.Weather - After talking to a local, there has been a huge shift in the weather since the tsunami. It was very windy and would rain on and off each day .. longest rain during the day lasted about 5 min. Rained almost everynight. Was partly cloudy all of the time. But for us coming from the Canadian climate .. we were very happy with that! Also the humidity is so high that it was always warm. So the rain didn't bother us at all!Shopping - You can walk 20 min in either direction down the beach from the Bavaro Princess. We found the flee market to the left much better. The store workers take the 'in your face' approach. But after a few minutes we became the same. Always being polite however. Just a firm 'no thankyou' and kept walking worked well. All of the stores sold pretty much the same things. I tried to find one store that had a few things I wanted so I would only have to barter once .. then I was done!! Offer 75% below what they want and go from there. I walked away many times and they always came around to what I wanted to pay. Just be firm and know what you want to pay. If you are paying in Dominican Pesos bring a calculator. I was constantly borrowing one from the store just to make sure I knew what I was paying in US dollars. When you are bartering it can get out of hand quick. That way I always knew I wasn't getting ripped off. Found these store workers to be much less pushy than the other flee market which was down the beach to the right. (near the fishing boats) We didn't buy anything there. There are shops in the lobby which are pricey and there is a plaza just outside of the resort to the left. We didn't mind it there but again had to be firm. They will all want you to come into there stores. If you want to go in, fine, if you don't, don't. Your in charge .. remember that!Money - Deal in US funds. Our travel agent told us that we could cash in our US travellers cheques for US money at the front desk in our hotel. YOU CAN'T! All they will give you is Dominican Pesos which are no good anywhere else in the world. So we were just cashing in a little at a time. We then found out that the casino will give you US money for the US travellers cheque .. so that's what we did from that point on. They do expect you to do a bit of gambling but it isn't manditory. When we did though and they served us free drinks at the slots. (don't know if this had anything to do with the VIP or not) Also bring lots of $1 US bills for tipping. A little bit definately went a long way with regards to service. Disco's - Found the disco in the casino to be a bit drab. But met a guy who worked at the hotel who took us to a Disco out of the resort up the road and had a blast there. Very busy and a lot of fun! Full of locals which were so friendly and very eager to show you how to 'dance'. They are really great dancers!!Food - We ate at all of the restaurants except for the Seafood one. I don't have one bad thing to say. Every restaurant, we found, tries to cater to all of the different cultures that are visiting the resort so we found plenty to eat. Keep in mind your not at home so it's not going to be exactly the same .. but have an open mind and be willing to try some different things. We found great western flair in everything we ate and left each restaurant saying .. that was the best yet! We didn't get sick at all. My friend ate some oysters at the main buffet at lunch the one day and didn't feel so good afterwards .. but we were told to stay away from the seafood so I did. Really great house wine (got better wine with VIP .. so we were told)The Doctor - The one downside to my trip was that I got pinkeye. Very contagious so I could have really picked it up anywhere. Thankfully I had lots of insurance and found the doctor on site to be very helpful. Cleaned me up, gave me the medication I needed and sent me on my way. By the next day I was ready to go again! One thing though is the location of the doctors office. They are renovating her office so the map was wrong .. but all we did was ask one of the staff and they guided us right where we needed to be. The Staff - We found Dominican people to be sooo friendly. Whether they can speak English or not. We found that if we attempted some Spanish often times they would come back and answer in English. They really appreciated our attempts. Even when I was waiting for the doctor .. one of the staff carved up a coconut for me to enjoy while I waited. I honestly can't say one bad thing about any of the staff .. other than the Internet Lady! She is very strict about your time on the computer. If you have a free hour (VIP) use it in one sitting. If you only use 5 minutes she'll take the whole hour from you .. period! And make sure you make note of when you sat down at the computer. One time she tried to tell me my hour was up when I had only been on for 30 minutes. I simply told her when I sat down and how much time I had left and used it in full. She didn't bug me after that.Things to bring (we were glad we did): Colored face cloth (they have white towels but no face clothes, so you don't want them taking yours), calculator, snacks for the room (very expensive in the store), first aid kit (bandaids etc and any meds), backpack, bug spray (even though we only saw 1 mosquito), suntan lotion, hand sanitizer and an alarm clock.Tours - We were able to book them the morning after we got there through our Signature Vacations rep. at a little meeting they had with us. You could book though anytime throughout the week at the desk where our rep was located. We went on the Safari (EXCELLENT)(an all day excursion) and Sonoa Island (we were gone for 12 hours) long day but very relaxing. They say you get to snorkle but don't tell you that you need to bring your own gear so we were disappointed that we didn't get to do that. But for the most part if we would have been there for a 2nd week we would have easily gone again!Security - This was one thing I was kind of worried about having heard some horror stories. But thankfully my worries were all just a myth. My experience anyway. There was security everywhere all of the time. On the beach, on the paths, in the lobby and at the main gate. I got home quit late a couple of nights and they were quite eager to whisk me onto a tram and get me home (and of course I was tipping good) but none the less I never ever felt like I wasn't being taken care of. If your friendly and not rude they were more than willing to help you. They would often say .. you must be from Canada!! We've got a good reputation there .. so should keep it that way!Spa - An experience to say the least! I had a Peticure done and my friend got a manicure. One staff member called in sick so we had one guy who had to do us both at the same time. He didn't speak a word of English so this turned out to be quite the experience. We had lots of laughs though and they served us ice tea in fancy glasses while we were there. The guy who was working on us was very tired after working double duty all day but did his best to make our visit pleasant. The one thing we weren't impressed with was the cleanliness of the instruments he used. Wouldn't have that done again but would go for a massage. Did do the 20 min massage at the pool .. 20 min wasn't long enough!! Entertainment - We found it absolutely hilarious! We found ourselves catching the 10 o'clock show each night. Each night was different and very entertaining. They do lipsink but the dancing and overall show overtakes that aspect. They had a lot of audience participation which made it fun and talked in many different lanuages to accomidate everyone. We enjoyed it a lot.At night we hung out in the 'huge' lobby area. There was tons of seating .. really comfy couches and chairs. Nice dimmed lighting and an open air concept so always a nice light breeze coming through. There are two bars located in the lobby area so made for a pleasurable evening whether we were just playing cards or just hangin out. All in all, my experience with the Bavaro Princess Resort was excellent. Don't forget your in a different country where somethings are just done differently. Your on vacation so just relax and do things the 'Dominican Way'. If you do that, I have no doubt you'll have a great time!

<Content>A realistic summary Just got back tonight from one week at the Bavaro Princess and since I was constantly checking this site, felt I owed a review myself. I went along with my wife and 2 kids (ages 5 and 3). The bottom line is that I was glad we stayed at this resort primarilly because it is a suite which made it relatively comfortable for a family with 2 young kids. I felt it would be important to note my impressions relative to the reviews I had read previously.The most important issues to us were that we did not get sick or feel endangered by Malaria. Fortunately, even though we drank the water which was served (supposedly purified), none of us were sick. Time will tell if we come down with Malaria, but we took the pills and did not see any mosquitos. My wife did have 5 bites, but was told by another quest that had been to Punta Cana several times before that they were likely from very very small spiders in the beds and pose no harm. The room from first observation was that it was a little musty but decently sized and relatively clean. I saw one bug during my stay there which I felt was acceptable. The pull out bed, however was the worst bed I've ever laid on by far. I would ask the desk to roll in a cot if you need more room.The recent hurricane was not evident to us. Yes, there were downed tress in the jungle in between the 2 main living areas, but they could just have easilly been down prioir to the summer.The food was in my opinion average to poor. While it is true that you can always find something to eat, I felt dinner was the least enjoyable meal, because you could not as easilly get another chance, or see the food prioir to choosing it as you can at a buffet during lunch or breakfast. For those that felt that the food is just not catered for american tastes, I say these restaurants would not fluorish anywhere by themselves as seperate entitys. The staff however was very friendly at the restaurants, and while I was surprised how little tipping took place, I felt like I wanted to, not because I had to. As a general rule the folks away from the main building were very warm and loving.I do agree with the previous reviewer in that the front desk folks in general were not as willing to help. If you are someone that likes to stay connected to e-mail or voicemail while on vacation, I can tell you it is a major problem. The only way I could do it, was by going to the main building which was a 10 min walk and then hope someone could help me. There is a fee for online access as well as getting to an ATT operator for calls, which is fine with me, but to have to trek to the main building is just not right. One other thing to understand is that Punta Cana schedule seems to be hurry up and wait. Several things such as massages, dinners reservations, ground transportation to the airport, were such that we were warned to be punctual only to be waiting 10 - 30 minutes when we arrived on time. We went through Apple and while I thought my travel agent was great, I felt the rep at the hotel was only interested in selling excursions and was not to be relide upon for anything.We did not run into any really rude guests, but that is always kind of the luck of the draw on any vacation. I did feel like I wasn't sure how to greet people while walking by since you never know what their native tounge is, which I think inhibits mingling.Lastly, we did have VIP status and were happy with it. The location was convenient, which in itself was worth it with little kids. The massage was a nice bonus. The rum and cigars were OK. The premium drinks seemed to be the same for all. Hope this helps!

<Content>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. My girlfriend and I just returned from our extended vacation where we stayed at the Bavaro Princess in Punta Cana. We were in Punta Cana from Jan.5th- Jan.13th, 2005. I'll run right through everything and all our experiences while trying to keep it brief. First, we flew from Toronto using Skyservice and the trip over went smoothly except of course for the fact our brand new digital camera was stolen from my girlfriend's backpack during a half hour stopover in the Puerto Plata Airport while the plane was cleaned. We learned too late to always be on the lookout for sketchy characters who might steal right behind your back. Anyways, we arrived at our resort late at night and found our room was not oceanfront as it said on our itinerary and it had two single beds instead of a king as requested. At 1am we were moved to our new room with a king bed but the phone didnt work and we didn't have working lamps. Eventually during the week our phone was fixed but not the lamps. ROOM: The room was just as you might expect from the website or pictures on the internet. It was fairly big though the washroom is pretty small, all the rooms are the same with either a king or two twin beds.LOBBY: The lobby is massive and provides a great place to go for a drink or hang out because its always busy. I really liked the lobby because of its sheer enormity and the two ponds and various in and around it really added to the atmosphere.RESORT DESIGN: The resort is massive and it grows tiresome making the long trip from the room to the lobby or the beach. There are shuttles running constantly but sometimes its just faster to walk than wait for one to come along. With such a huge resort you really do get the feeling customer service suffers and you become just a number. The strong point of its design is that it is incredibly lush and green with lots of palm trees and well manicured walkways and grounds. BEACH: The beach is amazing and easily the highlight of an otherwise disappointing trip. Even in January where temperatures are the coldest the water was perfect and never too cold for a swim. The beach got pretty packed on nice days but there were always lots of available beach chairs. There's always a bar closeby on the beach to grab a drink and there's the snack bar and a restaurant close by for food. You hear the stories of topless sunbathers and they certainly are true, many women walk around topless on the beach or swim topless and this also true for the pools. My girlfriend and I weren't really prepared for this but its not a big deal to us but it might be worth noting for some.POOL: I also really liked the pool and it always was busy with lots of people around the pool sunbathing but the actually pool itself was rarely busy. There's a nice little swim-up bar too. FOOD: The first thing that needs to be noted was that we both got food poisoning and this cost us each a day because we were so sick. I heard from others that this was quite common and I'm not sure if this had to do with the resort and its preparation methods or just the fact that you're in the Dominican Republic and you're bound to get sick from the food at some point because of the nature of the country. We figure it was chicken that led to this sickness and we avoided chicken for the rest of the trip. The food at the buffets didn't impress us at all but it should be noted we are somewhat picky. RESTAURANTS: HISPANIOLA is the buffet restaurant at the lobby which serves breakfast from 7-10am, lunch from 1-3 or 4pm, and dinner from 6:30 until 10pm. You don't need reservations. Like I said the food was disappointing for the both of us. I ended up having fruit and french toast pretty much everyday for breakfast because I didnt enjoy anything else not that I didnt try. There really wasn't much difference between breakfast and lunch in terms of what they served and really they really didn't have that much variety. We went there once for dinner and we didn't enjoy a pasta bar where you create a pasta and they make it for you right in front of you. This brings me to an issue we had. One night we realized we hadn't made reservations for dinner anywhere, we called the concierge and we were told we'd have to eat at the buffet restaurant. Now it's really not that tough to make reservations but it was disappointing to walk by an a la carte restaurant and see tons of open tables but we couldn't go in because we had forgot to make reservations. Rules are rules I guess. BELLA PASTA: We were much happier with this place. They serve pasta, pizza and other Italian entrees. The food was above average and the service was very good.LICEYS: We really enjoyed the food here and the service was also very good. Its a very romantic atmosphere and a nice perk for the VIP's. The only problem I had was that night and the next day I was very ill with what was suspected to be food poisoning.GOUCHO: The steakhouse was also good. We both ordered T-bones and though they were very thin they were very tasty. We ordered ceasar salads for an appetizer and they were easily the worst ceasar salads we had ever had and certainly didnt look as they should but we didn't let this bother us. CHOPIN: This was a huge disappointment. We had thought it was a la carte because we had to make reservations and then showed up to find it was buffet and not a very good buffet but it was still probably better than Hispaniola. The piano player and singer that come by your table on the boat is very nice though and we had a front row seat.We never made it to El Pescador or Sakura.MacPrincess: We often went here for burgers and fries and they weren't too bad. This is the only place open from midnight to 5am which can be a problem for some because it is very far away from many villas and only serves a few things. This brings me to another point, most resorts always have some place open to eat, one place to count on but at the Bavaro Princess you must memorize the schedule to know where you can eat and when and there are times when nothing is open anywhere.SERVICE: The reception and front desk staff was for the most part very rude and short and often didnt speak english which was very frustrating. When you deal with hundreds and hundreds of people everyday its easy to forget to be courteous with the people who spent thousands of dollars to stay there. I heard this complaint from several people and also watched in person a few times as people checked-in and didnt get what they had requested and the front desk staff couldn't care less. However, the restaurant staff, the housekeeping staff, bartenders and most other staff were very polite and eager to please. We tipped these staff well.INTERNET CENTER: I only mention this because its a bit of a joke. The person working there understands absolutely no english and my broken Spanish didn't do the trick. As a VIP you get an hour free per person but you must use this together and all at once. Something that was explained to me afterwards by our Sunwing rep. Also the internet was down when we got there, it was very slow and the keyboard had been set up for a Spanish user as was the service which created several issues. NIGHTLY SHOWS: These are very humourous though not intentionally. We didnt expect much so werent disappointed but it was just lip synching and choreographed dancing in costumes. We had planned to go on a snorkeling trip (Tropical Storm) but it was cancelled because of the weather which was slight rain. We were never informed it was cancelled, we just sat there for an hour then when our Sunwing rep got to the resort we asked him about it and he found out for us that it had been cancelled. Emilio, our sunwing rep, was pretty helpful and got results. This became clear to us on our final day. We didnt depart the hotel until 6pm and were told by Emilio at the start of the week the resort would give us a courtesy room to shower and change so we could go to the beach for the day. Coming back from the beach we went to get our courtesy room and the front desk staff told us there were no rooms available in the entire resort and we were out of luck. Infuriated, we went to Emilio and he complained to the staff that there must be a room as promised and after much spanish discussion suddenly they had magically found us a courtesy room. As an additional note, on our trip home we sat on the plane ready for take-off only to find there was a serious problem with the plane. We had to get off the plane and we spent another night in Punta Cana as they sent a lear jet to get a part for our broken skyservice 757. This might actually be the high point of the trip because for this one night we were all put up at the Bahia Principe and we loved it there. Though not nearly as lush as the Bavaro the room we had was much more nice, far fewer bugs! The lobby and pool were beautiful and they have an amazing enclosed market square with shops, a casino, a disco and a snack bar. The prices at these shops were far more reasonable than the gift shop at the Bavaro. We would never go back to the Bavaro Princess but would definitely spend a week at the Bahia.We never made it to the casino at the Bavaro and this was a bit of a disappointment because it is supposed to be nice. The market across the street is crazy! Vendors are so pushy and this really made us want to leave so we did. The prices are ridiculous though you can negotiate them down but we grew tired of this act quickly. $42 for some magnets and a cheap necklace suddenly became $26.This review is far longer than I wanted but the bottom line is even with all the disappointments we still enjoyed ourselves because we chose to make the best out of it, and the beautiful weather didn't hurt either.

<Content>The time of my life I just came back from a great vacation (Dec 26th-Jan.2nd) with 3 of my girlfriends. The staff at the Bavaro Princess were simply amazing. They are the main reason why I will return there. No matter what time it is there the staff always greets you with a friendly smile and a Hola! whether it was staff from the lobby, the maids, the animations staff, the bartenders, or the drivers that drove the tram, they were all so sincere. My friends and I made a 2nd family there at the Bavaro Princess. We still keep in touch with the workers there. The restaurants and the food are great. The beach and pool area are amazing!!!! If you have a chance to go on New Years do it, it was fantastic, with a great show, fire works, and afterwards party at the disco. Overall our stay was terrific and I cant wait to get back to see my family ; ) MUCHO BESO!!!!!

<Content>Book Now My partner and I went for two weeks. We figured we'd be bored or sick of the food by the end but we were wrong. Everything from the food, the service, the grande rooms, the beaches, the entertainment and the spa were awesome. We will go back for sure. I am afraid to go any where else now because the experience at the Bavaro was just fantastic and it will be hard to find another resort to top it.

<Content>Good Week Good time had by all. Service was great. The staff could not have been nicer. Just not much to do for teens at nite. They need a real place for teens on Holiday weeks. Shuttle got you around quickly. Very nice beach. We upgraded to VIP I dont think it mattered. You still had to wait at Resturants and still got top shelf drinks if you asked for it. We would go back.

<Content>Nice Time Xmas week 2004 was very busy at the Princess. Storm damage was very visible but new plantings were going in daily. A year from now, baring any more bad hurricanes, the complex will be lush again. The layout of the complex is fine. Lots of identical front/rear 8 suite duplex units. Everyone uses the winding path. The tram gets you around quickly. They ply the walkways every 10 minutes but nothing is more than 10-15 minutes walking time. The drivers are courteous to everyone. Service vehicles also use the paths to get around. The beach and sand were beautiful but with the resort full, everyone played a little beach chair bingo to get chaises under the numerous shady thatched huts. Except for the beach area, the resort felt uncrowded. The pools are very nicely shaped with lots of spots to sit and read or mingle with others. All drinking water is bottled with sealed gallon jugs in each room. All ice and water served at the bars and restaurants is bottled. Don鈥檛 drink the tap water. Each suite has a free stocked mini bar with sodas, water and a few beers. Shower water temperature and pressure varied among the units. The spa was very nice. We met lots of vacationers from Europe, Canada and the USA while playing volleyball. Everyone was very friendly and eager to meet others. Housekeeping was fine but any repairs requested took a long time. Language is a problem out of the front desk area but anyone with some Spanish language knowledge will find a use for it. The food was plentiful. Lots of choices at the seven restaurants. No reservations accepted except at the Licey, but seating was quick and the service was good. The buffets were well stocked. I would recommend this resort to anyone looking for a reasonably priced vacation at a more than adequate site.

<Content>Not Very Good Service I just returned from a week holiday at the Bavaro Princess and was extrememly disappointed in the Hotel and quality of service. My girlfriend and I were in Punta Cana for two weeks. One week at a 4* and then transferred to the Bavaro Princess a supposed 5* Hotel. Upon arrival we checked into our hotel room where we had requested a king sized bed...there were two single beds in the room. Upon requesting this be fixed they simply put a king sized sheet on the bed and pushed them together. Strike One. Next we decide that we needed to grab a shower before heading out to the resaurant and we recieved only cold water and each day had to request that this be fixed. Finally three days later of cold showers we had hot water but very little water pressure. Strike Two. Finally and perhaps what lacked most at this hotel was Client Service. The staff at the restaurants and bars were at most average however we found that the staff was not friendly, the service was slow and that the food while good was usually luke warm to cold. Strike Three. I will never recommend a Princess hotel to any friends or family nor will I stay at one again. I have had better service at 3* hotels and would recommend that you look elsewhere if you are looking for quality and high class service.

<Content>great beach and great rooms we just got back from the princess and we had a great time. it was my husband and i . it felt like a 2ed honey moon. the rooms felt like little villas, it was so cool sitting out on the porch, it rained one day and we sat and read and naped it was so relaxing. we ended up turning off the air and keeping the doors and windows opened with the fan on ,it was perfect.the beach was fantastic. crowded at times - but who cares when your sunning and relaxing, the water was BEAUTIFUL. we would wake up before the sunrise and go for a swim.i want to thank the person that mentioned the room#s in the 700's i requested them and the next day they changed it for us. we so enjoyed being able to walk to to beach every morning. we also ate breakfest at chopins and was not impressed with any food but the lobster dinner and ate salad in the afternoon.but getting a tan in december and loosing weight on a vacation is kinda nice!

<Content>7 Excellent Days Our family spent the week after Christmas at the Bavaro Princess and would move in there if it was allowed. We had a wonderful experience.Check-in was very simple and staff were more than happy to show us where we needed to be and take us to our rooms. There's a separate luggage truck, so make sure your bags are tagged with your room number before heading there yourself.The resort had just fully reopened a couple weeks earlier after the hurricanes and a fire in previous months and it looked fabulous. The jungle area in the middle of the resort looked like a hurricane had hit it - trees were knocked over, etc, but I'm not sure if that's the way it is supposed to look. Workers were still working on replanting some flowers and bushes and trees around the property, but overall it looked really nice. The beach was big and had chairs available, even when we got there around noon. If you want a seat in the sun by the pool, get there before 10am, but the pool itself is very nice. Ramon and Reuben at the pool bar will keep your drink full all day.Some people have complained about the lobby and some of the rooms being quite a walk from the beach and pool area. Even though our room was a short walk away, I did not find it to be troublesome when we made it and we pushed our 5 month old girl around in her stroller. There are shuttles going all the time, so you can ride if you like. Plus, all of our after-dinner activities were done in the main lobby bar area, so if people are looking to stay out later at night, it might be preferable to be closer to the front of the resort, so the walk is shorter after tipping back a few.The food is hit-and-miss. The buffets had something for everyone, and I found them to be pretty good. La Hispaniola in the lobby is the best of the buffets - had more variety of offerings. Chopin was smaller, but still quite good. Your omelette and juice can be made-to-order in the morning- get there before 9am if you don't want to wait in line for these. The sit down restaurants were ok. Bella Pasta was ordinary, Pescador was quite decent, Licey was a nice atmosphere and had good food and service and Sakura, which is Asian-inspired, was a nice change of pace and we all enjoyed what we ordered. The New Year's Eve buffet at La Hispianola was excellent. They pulled out all the stops - great fish and meat selections and the desserts were gorgeous.Finally, the staff are fantastic. They were all so friendly and always said Hola to you, even if driving by in a truck. Everyone, from the maids to the bartenders to the restaraunt greeters took time to make our baby smile and speak to her in cute Spanish phrases. Definitely try to learn the basics of the language, and if you speak Spanish at all, talk to the staff beyond por favor and thank you. We spoke to more than one about working there and family. My brother-in-law even saw pictures of the gate-keepers family. Say Hola to Ramon from Mateo, will you?Overall, we would go back in a heartbeat. Having the baby along, we didn't go on any of the excursions or do watersport activities. But there will definitely be a next time.

<Content>service is variable We just returned from 7 days at the Bavaro Princess. The beach is beautiful. The food is fair at best and there is very little variety. We had a good meal at Sakura. There are not many of the staff who speak english,; fortunately, I was able to speak spanish. The service is very slow and disorganized. The people are very nice, just not very helpful. There were no organized activities for teens and no place that they could all gather to meet each other. The disco is in the Casino, so they can't even go there to dance unless they are 18 years old. We did meet other nice families, which made the vacation very pleasant.

<Content>Awesome Experience!! To all those worried about the Malaria outbreak and to those who cancelled their vacation to other destinations, you missed a fabulous vacation spot. If I saw 2 mesquitos on the whole resort in our week stay...that was lots. Muskol bug spray will do the trick if you are worried about evenings. The day of our arrival Dec 21 was lost due to late arrival in having to combine 2 flights due to cancellations  in no way reflecting on the hotel. The lobby of the hotel is huge with water  tropical setting in the middle  bars, buffet restaurant, gift shops, internet access,  large counter where your tour advisor is available every day if assistance is required. While spanish is the predominant language of the employees, the checkin/out desk and other spots in the lobby speak english very well. Throughout the resort we had no problem in getting by with the language and all staff even to the groundskeepers always had a smile and Hola.The resort is a huge tropical flower garden  bird sancutary and stone sidewalks well lit to all rooms which look like mini apartment buildings with 4 rooms on upper level and 4 rooms on lower level. Due to the size of the resort  spacing between buildings you will never be crowded with people and the setting is very quiet. Each room has it's own patio, beautiful decor with marbel floor throughout  is well air conditioned. Kitchen facilities included coffemaker and mini frig stocked each day with soft drinks, beer,  sealed gallon jugs of drinking water. There is a living/sitting area and separate bedroom. A huge vanity area with closet, hair blowdryer,iron  board  free locked safe for valuablesSink and bathroom shower taps are for washing only. All other water and ice cubes throughout the resort are purified and safe for drinking.The beach is also huge and you will not feel crowded with a surplus of lounge chairs  towels available. I walked for a long while in both directions to compare other hotel beaches and there was no comparison. By far this is the best! There are 2 huge buffet restaurants, one at beach and one in lobby with unbelievable varieties available. Freshly baked rolls  bread. Pasta, eggs, fruit juices will be prepared in front of you for what you desire. There are also 4 separate restaurants if you want to sit and be waited on...again the food is great. I have visited many other carribean resorts and this one has been the BEST by far. It is the first time I have not had a need to take gravol or imodium. Do not hesitate to go.

<Content>Can't wait to go back! We have just returned from the most amazing vacation at Bavaro Princess All Suites. I had read many reviews, most of them good, but for the life of me I can't imagine anyone having anything bad to say about the experience - especially the food. There was SO much to choose from, even though there was sometimes a lengthy wait keep in mind you are on vacation and what's the rush? The lobster, pizza steaks, pasta, waffles, donuts, burgers, fries, grilled cheese, salads, omelets just to name a few of our favourites were amazing. The service was second to none and the resort was beautifully maintained. The nightly shows were awesome ... especially the ones with the animation staff! The staff is great and helped to make everyone have a great time. Some of our favoutites are ... Roberto (Asta la vista baby)- nightly bartender at the piano bar, Plinio- bartender at several bars, Carlos and Angel- front desk, Ramone 'the beautiful', Michel, Leandro, Rolando, and Roberto- all from the animation staff, Esther and Yerson- main buffet, J.D., and Joselo - from Goucho the Grillhouse, the manager from the beach restaurants (I forget his name), each and every one of the trolley drivers. These are just a few of the people who helped to make our vacation great. I only have one complaint ... the week went by too fast and we have to wait an entire year to go back to the same resort!

<Content>The Only Review You Need To Read! This is a beautiful resort. It has a lot of acerage as mentioned in some of the other reviews, but there are constant shuttles available. We did a lot of walking but the grounds are so beautiful it was a pleasure to get from one place to another on foot. The size of the resort worked to our advantage. We never felt crowded. I'm sure the resort was full, but we had no waiting and we often felt like we were the only ones on the property.The lobby area is fantastic. Its a real gathering place. Prior to and after dinner many of the guests gather here for drinks. It is large and comfortable. The piano bar is very relaxing in the lobby. The bar tenders are fantastic at all locations. We loved haning out in the lobby in the evening. Its a nice place to meet people.Restaurants on a scale of 1 - 10: Copin 8, Sakura 6, Gaucho 8, Licey 9, Italian 10, Seafood 8, Hispanola (buffet) 9. The food was fantastic. I was extremely impressed with the buffet. Breakfast, lunch and dineer gave a lot of choice with tons of flavour. There was also a lunch buffet by the beach that gave burgers and fries etc. Very tasty.Room: All suites are identical. We had a King bed (nice). I'm not sure if this is standard, but its worth requesting before hand it you want it. The suite was very roomy and comfortable. The mini fridge was always stocked and the A/C worked perfect.Beach: The beach is a 10, the sand is like sugar. Ocean: The water was a perfect temperature. The waves were fun, not too big.Pool: The free-form pool was beautiful with a great swim-up bar. There were pleny of lounge chairs available anytime, anywhere. This is something that was challenging at other resorts we have visited (this is our 3rd all-inc). The beach was never crowded.Enertainment: It was so so. The Coral Canoa in La Romano was much better. We usually turned in pretty early though. The morning at the beach was the best time. Between 0900-1100 it was plenty warm and nothing but the sound of the ocean. Paradise!VIP: The messed up our VIP status so we had to do a bit of recovering for the first few days. To be fair, I don't think it was the resort's fault that we were not showing as VIP. But once they agreed we were in fact VIP it took a while to get everything we should have gotten. The people are very nice and friendly, but their recovery in terms of guest services leaves something to be desired. My wife and I are pretty easy going though. You know those people who complain about everything? It probably would have ruined their trip. Not us. No big deal.Recap: You will love this resort. The large property made us feel like we were alone there. The rooms and staff were great. Learn a few Spanish words (Hola, gracias etc.) and you get plenty of smiles. The people who complain about the language barier should stay home. The food was great and the pool / beach were spectacular.

<Content>Amazing vacation! July 25th- Aug 1st my family  I went on a vacation to Bavaro Princess. When we got off our bus, we were welcomed very nicely with drinks. The service was very good. When we entered our room it was very clean and it had a lot of space and for people that have to have air condichining and a fan they have it! The setting of the hotels were very good. The staff was very kind and nice people.The food was very good and they had enough restaurants. Bavaro Princess is a big resort and a fantastic place to go on a vacation. They had enough entertament for children and adults. Just one little thing, these people dont know english that much!

<Content>For dissappoint then pleasure Punta Cana was my first time in the caribbean and it wasnt quite what i thought it would be. I was very excited after looking at pictures and dreaming or paradise but come to find out that it not wat i had met in Punta Cana. When we firsted arrived in Punta Canas little airport there were 2 women taking pictures with everyone who stepped off the plane. They had no expression to their face and u could tell they have had this horrible job for awhile. When i recieved my picture they looked more then bored to death. Getting on the bus and going through the airport wasnt so bad even tho no one around spoke English...Driving on the bus to the resort was rather sad, but definately educational. You realize how lucky you have it because the local people of Punta Cana are very poor and most do not have electricity or running water. So driving through that part of the country was very upsetting. Locals just stare at the buses going buy knowing how lucky the people on the inside have it...its a little akward because you are in their territory now. Arriving to the hotel was amazing. It was a beautiful place but the room was such a far walk from the beach but not far from t he dining areas. Catching the cart to get from here to there was a little annoying and hard to catch late at night on the way home from the bar (yes, the drinking age it 18!!..but i dont think it matters their...may 14 yr old brother was gettin served.) Not many Americans around their....Mostly Europeans....but that was also another great experience in iteself....meeting to many people from different cultures and different parts of the world....most knew english pretty well. The beach was beautiful.....defy try out the banana boat (although our driver attempted to tip us over on numerous occasions), but if u have younger children and are protective...shield there eyes because many women walk around topless.....Euorpean culture i guess! Cuz i know that doesnt happen on beaches in America....but give it a try its quite refrehsing ;) The food was so-so i expected better although the fancy restuarant...i forget the name right now....was fabulous...only resturant out of the whole resort i was impressed with. MAKE RESERVATION! CHECK OUT THE NIGHTLY ENTERTAINMENT IN THE CONCERT/BAR PART OF THE HOTEL LOBBY!!! always a good time and 2 great bars on each side....if your younger and want more of a club atmosphere...go to the DISCO as it is called....usually started at 1am til 3 am....lots of younger ppl....18-30 dance music lil bar tables all around....very chill. Watch out for the creepy little lizards and wear sunblack. Also....BE AWARE IF THERE IS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY HELP ARRIVES VERY SLOWLY.....MY MOM CRACKED HER HEAD OPEN ON THE RESORT IN THE HOTEL ROOM AND IT TOOK A DOC 40 MINS TO GET THERE THEN SHE HAD TO BE RUSHED TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL WHERE NO ONE SPOKE ENGLISH! .....although my vacation was enjoyable for that time b4 that accident i just want everyone to be aware....medical attention arrives slowly......but all in all....punta canta is a grea place...good night life....very educational experience!!

<Content>Great Resort excpet for Hurricane Jeanne!!! My husband and I just got married and through our friends' persuasion we booked Bavaro Princess. It was awesome... for the day and a half of sunshine that we got. Hurricane Jeanne hit DR on Wedenesday night (we arrived on Monday afternoon) and rain/winds stayed til they evacuated us on the Sunday. We went through swamp waters that reached to our hips to line up 2 hours for food... we had to pack our food for the rest of the day because we did not want to go through the jumanji of a trip to get to the lobby (our room was by the beach/pool #347). Otherwise, the property was HUGE and great landscaping... but what really made the trip (even though it was horrendous weather wise) was the service... we had the bell boy from the lobby, Andres, who helped us through thick and thin... anything we needed, he was there to make sure we were okay. And the waitstaff at La Hispaniola were awesome. They're always with a smile even when the weather was life threatening. I have nothing bad to say about Bavaro Princess...the hotel and the staff... What I am peeved at is Sunquest. We were on a 2 week honeymoon and they had to fly us out early because they cannot gurantee us food/drinking water, which is understandable. they promised us credit ON PAPER but to this day, we have NO word on what's going on. I am pi$$ed that my honeymoon was not perfect because of the money we spent for this once in a lifetime trip, but Sunquest doesn't even care about their customers. word of advise people.... DO NOT BOOK WITH SUNQUEST VACATIONS!!! KUDOS TO BAVARO PRINCESS!!!!

<Content>Beautiful, but... I won this trip through a radio contest and I'd never been to the islands before. After reading every review I could find I was kind of unsure about what it would be like. My husband and I arrived on a Monday and departed Friday. Upon arrival we spent about 20 minutes in line at the reception desk waiting to check in. This was OK because we were just so happy to be there, we would have stood there all day! We did upgrade to the VIP package and it ws totally worth it simply because we didn't have to stand in this crazy long line every night to book dinner reservations. I felt bad for those people -- every morning we'd walk past this huge line on our way to the buffet. We also got robes, cigars, rum or something, and a dinner at the Licey. The Licey was OK but not our favorite. That would be Chopin, where they served (among other things) pasta bar! El Gaucho was very good too. I was terrified of food poisoning so I kept it really simple with the food. Lots of potatoes (excellent potatoes!), pasta bar, tomatoes, stayed away from mayo-based anything (why risk it?). My husband ate everything and was fine. The snack bar was OK. We didn't eat at the seafood restaurant at all but we did lunch at Bella Pasta almost every day (more pasta bar!) La Hispaniola was just OK. There's a gas-powered trolley to get around the resort, which is really big. I suggest exploring, it was very nice to stroll the grounds. The grounds were beautifully landscaped with gorgeous trees and there were two peacocks strutting around. The room was really nice and our housekeeper (who we never saw but tipped $2 per day) did a great job. Our safe was busted and it took several phone calls and two days to get it fixed. In the meantime we had to find inventive places to stash our money while we were out of the room. It really wasn't a big deal but it was frustrating that something that simple took so long to get fixed. I'm glad we didn't have any problems like no hot water, etc.! The staff was very friendly except the masseuse - she was a sadist with a capital S. That massage was quite the painful experience! My husband was actually grunting in pain. When we were done we just looked at each other like, What the *%$# was THAT all about? But it was only painful during, not after, so what do I know? Oh, one big problem: the sprinkler system, which activated almost every day, must have been sourcing from the sewage line because it smelled so bad. Horrible, I'm not exaggerating. But that's why you stay at the pool or beach all day! Yes, we'd go back in a heartbeat! Have fun!

<Content>Very Relaxing! My husband and I went to the Bavaro Princess from Sept. 4 to 11, 2004, and we had a fabulous time. We are both in our late twenties and the goal of our trip was to relax as much as possible, and we definitely achieved our goal over and above. The weather was absolutely gorgeous with sun all day long. We did get a couple of showers, but they were all at night.Flight: We flew out of Toronto with Skyservice. When we checked in we requested seats in an aisle where there were no seats in front of us because we heard how cramped Skyservice was. We got what we asked for and it was a very comfortable flight compared to some others on the plane. The meal they served was a sandwich with a dessert and juice. If you want anything extra (i.e. soft drink, chips, nuts), you have to pay extra. Each person gets a pillow and blanket, which I was happy about because it always gets cold on airplanes. We both found that the service from the flight attendants was very good, nothing to complain about.Check-In: We arrived at the resort at noon and were told our room was not yet ready. They said check-in time was 3 p.m., so our room would be ready then. We went to get some lunch and lie by the pool to kill some time. At 3 p.m. we went back to reception and were told our room was still not ready. We waited another 20 minutes and then my husband went to talk to them again and told them we wanted our room immediately. This seemed to work because they then gave us our key to our room.Room: We booked a Super VIP room, which means you get all the extras of VIP with oceanfront. I would highly recommend booking VIP simply for the convenience of booking your dinner reservations with the concierge. Non-VIP guests had to line up at 8 a.m. every morning to book their reservations. With VIP, you can book all your dinners in one shot at the beginning of the week. You also get three cigars, rum, bathrobes, massage, horse back riding, and a gourmet dinner. The other plus is that you are very close to the beach and main pool. The property is very large and it can be a pain to walk a long distance to the beach everyday. The room was very nice and roomy. The floors and walls in the bathroom are all marble. We e-mailed the resort a week in advance requesting a second floor room with a king size bed, and that was exactly what we got(room #747 鈥?great location). There is a mini fridge in each room that they fill with soft drinks, beer, and water everyday. Make sure you bring a bottle opener with you to open the soft drink bottles. They had a bottle opener on the wall at the bar area of our room, but it did not work because it was bent and worn out. We did not have a musty smell like some others have reported in their reviews.Beach: The beach is absolutely beautiful. The sand is very soft and raked very often. There are many chairs and we never found that there was a shortage of palapas. Sometimes we only got the beach at 10 a.m., and we were still able to spot a lot of free palapas, but I think the hotel was only at 50% capacity, so the chair situation would probably be a lot different at peak travel times. The ocean was warm with some waves. The water is not clear because the waves kick the sand up, so you cannot see through the water. There are very many topless women at the beach. Although it didn鈥檛 bother us, we did find it odd that not only did they sunbath topless, but they would also talk walks on the beach and swim in the ocean topless. I also found it odd that many of the children (girls) were topless. At certain ages it doesn鈥檛 really matter, but I thought that the 11 year old girls going topless was a little inappropriate, it just did not seem right.Pool: There are two pools, one next to the beach and restaurants and one next to the main lobby. The pool at the main lobby is very quiet because it is very far from the beach. If you prefer hanging out at the pool and want a quiet environment, then this is the place to go. The pool down at the beach is quite busy. It is very large, and we found it to be a little dirty with sand from the beach. The animation staff also holds a lot of their activities at this pool if you like to participate in those kinds of things.Restaurants: This resort has a large selection of restaurants. We ate at all of them, except for the El Pescuador (seafood) because we do not like seafood. All in all, the food was pretty good. I think a lot of the dishes were geared towards European taste, but we were always able to find something that we liked. I also take into account that I am in a different country and the food will not be what I am used to at home. I am also from Montreal, which has some of the best restaurants in the world, so it is not fair to compare it to food back at home. At El Gaucho (steakhouse) I had the chicken and my husband ate the steak. My chicken was pretty good and my husband said that his steak was excellent. At Bella Pasta (italian), we both had the chicken carciatore. The taste was good, but watch out for the small pieces of chicken bone (especially for small children). I would also like to add that they did not have pasta on their menu as a main course. I found that a little strange for an Italian restaurant. Chopin (buffet) was probably our least favorite restaurant out of all of them. It is an open-aired restaurant next to a creek. In the creek there is supposed to be a boat that has a piano and a singer on it floating around, but they were not there. Since it is next to a creek, there are a lot of mosquitoes. There was not much meat at the buffet, except for seafood. With the low variety of meat and the mosquitoes, we were very anxious to eat and get out of there. Sakura (japanese) was surprisingly good. We both had the tenderloin brochette and it was excellent. La Hispaniola is the only restaurant in which you do not need a reservation for supper. They always had a good variety and the food was good. This buffet is open for breakfast, lunch, and supper, and is located at the main lobby. For breakfast, I highly recommend the fresh-made waffles and donuts (mm! mm! good!). They also serve breakfast at 10 a.m. at one of the restaurants next to the beach, but there is not a very large choice of food. One of the things I really liked about this resort was that they had a lot of restaurants open for lunch. You could eat a buffet lunch at Bella Pasta, El Gaucho, and La Hispaniola. You could also get hamburgers, hot dogs, and fries at the MacPrincess. Since we were VIP, we were able to eat at Licey鈥檚. This is a very fancy restaurant and the food is great! The waiters are very professional with white glove service and they even serve you a caviar entr茅e. One of the inclusions with VIP is that you get to have better wine with your dinner. We found the VIP wine was very good, and although we did not try the non-VIP wine, we heard bad things about it.Property: The property is absolutely gorgeous! It is very large (96 acres), and they have a tram that runs through the resort to drive guests from one end to the other. Previous reviews have complained about the diesel fumes from the trams, but they did get a new tram while we were that that runs on regular fuel that is a lot quieter with no smell. Hopefully this means that they will be changing all of their trams in the near future. The bungalows are very nice looking with eight units in each spread out in the resort. You can often find wildlife roaming free on the resort 鈥?peacocks, chickens, geese. One day we had a peacock wander into the MacPrincess restaurant. Apparently this was normal behavior because nobody seemed to mind. There is a bird house section on the resort, but I am not sure how often it is maintained. It looked a little deserted when we were there, I felt kind of bad for the animals. At the lobby, you can find more birds 鈥?ducks, flamingos, shore birds. We enjoyed feeding them with bread from the buffet. They are used to humans so they come very close to you. Spa: They have a health center at the front of the resort. We did not use it, but we did go to check it out. The main disadvantage is that there is no air conditioning in the workout room. Other than that it looked pretty nice. I cannot comment on the spa services because I did not use them.Shows: We went to a few of the shows and we found them to be pretty good. Some of them had audience participation while others were dancing or singing shows. They had some nice costumes and the shows were a nice way to end your day.Shopping: They have four stores on site 鈥?souvenirs, gift shop, clothing boutique, jewelry. The prices at these shops are very high and you cannot bargain with them. Across the street from the hotel there is a small shopping mall and you will be able to get a lot better deals there. They have the same merchandise as what you will find at the resort shops. It is very safe and we did not have any problems with the vendors being too aggressive.Staff: The staff was very courteous and friendly. Some of the staff was not able to speak English, but we were able to communicate with most of them. We did not expect them to speak perfect English because we were in a Spanish-speaking country! We tried our best to learn a little bit of their language, but it is not necessary if you are not interested in trying. Guests: The majority of the guests are from Spain and Portugal, therefore they are Spanish-speaking. We rarely came across any Americans or Canadians. The only thing I did not like about this was that I find the Europeans do not have the same manners as we do. For instance, they do not wait their turn to get on the trams, they will jump on regardless of whether you were there first or not. We got used to it really quick and just learned to treat them the way they treated us 鈥?situation fixed!Tips鈥ring bug spray; I got a lot of bites on my feet and ankles. I think it was mostly from sand fleas, but some of them came from our dinner at Chopin as well.鈥ring more sunscreen than you think you will need. You do not want to run out and have to buy it at the gift shop for $20 US.鈥ring a bottle opener to open the pop bottles in your room. 鈥ring colored washcloths, they do not provide you with any in the room.鈥ring a small alarm clock because there are no clocks in your room. We brought a small portable one, so we could bring it with us to the beach as well.鈥ring Tums, Imodium, and Pepto just in case. We did not have a problem with sickness, but you never know.Summary: We really enjoyed this resort and would definitely recommend it! It has a lot to offer for everyone鈥檚 tastes, whether you like to party or just relax on the beach. We probably will not return because we prefer a smaller size resort and the property at Bavaro Princess is beyond huge. Besides that, this resort was absolutely perfect for what we needed 鈥?a nice relaxing vacation! If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me at lbodnik@mail2catlover.com

<Content>One week not enough Every year we take a cruise and this year I wanted to try an all inclusive. I saw an ad for the Bavaro Princess in the DR and asked my travel agent to check it out for me. She recommended the area for the newer resorts and fantastic beaches. With this good news I booked a weeks stay.Friends of ours were going to the DR just before us, so we aksed where they were staying. To our surprise, it was the Bavaro Princess.You can tell us what it is like when you get back, I suggested. We can tell you now, since other family members had already been and were going back again with them. Their review was fantastic. They have two small children who both loved the Princess.We loved to walk the beach and in my opinion, the Princess had the very best and biggest beach area for a good hour walk in either direction. Lots of activities and the staff did their very best to get everyone up and active. I met people from Europe, Russia and all parts of Central and South America. No rudeness, just great friendly people.One French couple at a table next to us at dinner, asked if we would like some of their champaign. They could not finish the bottle on their own. The waiter brought us glasses and we shared conversation. The waiter came back to see if we would like more champaign. I said yes if there was any left in the bottle. We heard the cork pop and yes he opened a new bottle. The service was excellent.We enjoyed every meal and no it didn't always compare to what we received on the cruise ships. It was very good to excellent and we enjoyed trying some of the local fare. One night my steak was a little tough but the next time I ordered it, it was tender and very tasty.I felt the best drinks were made at the lobby bar but I also enjoyed the self serve draft beer on the beach. The pizza was always great for lunch or snacks. For breakfast, I had to have two or more smoothies. The new Asian restaurant was terrific but the air conditioner made it very cold inside. One request to the staff and they adjusted it right away. The service was always great!My wife put together gift bags with inexpensive items such as lipstick and other items the maids would like. We had many thankyous and on our last day, our maid put together her own gift bag for us, with some local treasures inside.The grounds were beautiful and we enjoyed walking them, especially after a big meal. Well maintained. One gardener went out of his way to see that my wife and I had fresh coconuts to eat and drink from. The service was very friendly!One week was not enough. I am in the process of booking a two week stay for this February. I am even going to request the same room again.

<Content>Relaxing Get-a-Way We recently returned from a long weekend at the Bavaro Princess in beautiful Punta Cana. We traveled in a large group (12 people - 4 kids and 8 adults). This is our second time to visit the Punta Cana area and we plan to return again. The first time we were in the Dominican Republic we stayed at the Riu Tiano we really liked that one as well. We did not get the VIP package which was worrying me after reading the reviews of the resort because everyone seemed to be getting it, well my advise鈥?don鈥檛 waste your money. We got a very nice room  never had any trouble getting dinner reservations.The lobby at the Princess is huge and very tropical it has fountains and ponds in it. Check-in went smoother at the Riu, but we did not have a problem at the Princess, just the English was not as good, but what can you say, we were in another country and getting rooms for 12 people. At the Princess we were put in building 3, very close to the beach. Both resorts are large and require a good deal of walking, the princess being even much larger than the Riu, but the Princess had tram to ride on which worked very nicely for my 2 brothers with mobility problems. We actually enjoyed getting to know the drivers who were very friendly. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous lots of flowers and trees; it really is a tropical like setting! The rooms at the Princess were very nice, very lux, even a bidet. The rooms all have a refrigerator in them, stocked with pop and beer. The fridge is in a strange spot, under the TV in the dresser. The rooms also have a wet bar in the dinning area. Oh my husband had a surprise one morning while making coffee; he found a really small lizard in our coffee basket! I鈥檓 just glad he found it and not me. Just remember that you are in a tropical environment and I guess that those things are bound to happen, hey but no bugs in the room!We had a very easy time getting drinks at the Princess, and a much wider variety of liquors then the Riu. The banana Mama is delicious as well as the coco loco.The food in the Dominican Republic is different then we are used to in the US鈥? Let鈥檚 just say I didn鈥檛 gain any weight! We did not check in until 2pm and since it was so late and we had such a large group the restaurants were booked so we ate at the main buffet that night, we didn鈥檛 like that very much. But while we were checking for the reservations for the first night we were able to make them for the next night for all 12 people to eat at the steakhouse. You can get your reservation from 8-3 in the lobby, and you can book it for the next day.The Steakhouse at the Princess was not very good, but they did have really good rice鈥eriously that is what my sister and I lived on until we found the seafood restaurant! At the steakhouse I ordered a caesar salad and it came out with some small bony fish all over it鈥ust not what I expected, but when I told the waiter that I didn鈥檛 like it he took it away and brought me out a regular salad. My husband got something that he thought was good until he asked the waiter what it was and he was told that it was cow throat! The morning on the second day I went down and made reservations again for all 12 people for the following day at El Pescador, the Seafood Restaurant, it was really good, the grilled lobster was awesome and the waiters were 100 times better then any I have ever had in the states! The Mc Princess also has good burgers. We ate breakfast and lunch at the Chopin we liked it much better than the main buffet. No one in our group got sick from the food; I think you just have to be careful about what you eat.The beach in Punta Cana is just unreal, VERY beautiful. It does have topless bathing though which is a bit of a rude awakening. It helps you realize why we have laws in the U.S requiring us to wear clothes! Trust me it is not what most men would dream it to be. The beach is very clean and huge, it does not feel crowded and there were lots of huts, we never had a problem getting one at the beach or the pool. There are two pools, but we never went to one of them we liked the big one by the beach. It is huge and has a small waterfall in it, and a bar. It was really nice and my brothers loved it. As for the mini zoo, well don鈥檛 just base your trip on it鈥aha it has some lizards and 2 birds, it was on the trail as you walk to the main lobby, it was fun to walk through but nothing spectacular.The night shows were very similar to the ones that we had at the Riu, kind of cheesy. Go down just to relax and have a few drinks, but don鈥檛 expect a Broadway production. Their humor is just different from ours.We had a very nice time at the Bavaro Princess and would definitely recommend it as a beautiful and relaxing get-a-way!

<Content>WOW What a Week -- Bavaro Princess I just recently arrived back home from my amazing honeymoon in Puna Cana with my new wife Erin. Let me begin by saying...that this resort lived up to everything it promised to be and more. The weather was amazing, even with all the hurricane warnings.The staff was very curdious, always smiling, and doing everything in thier power to make you smile too. There was lots of games everyday for people of all ages.I loved the food! The only thing I found a little questionable were the eggs, they seemed a little under cooked all the time.All the restaurants (that I visited) were excellent. The steak houne (El Graucho), pasta house (Bella Pasta), buffet (Chopin), and a la cart restuarant (Licey). They also have a chinese restaurant (Sakura) and a seafood restaurant that I didnt try.There was always food ready at any time of the day!The Room was incedible, 1 minute walk from the ocean. The suites were huge and very well maintained. The resort is not that big...only lasy people cannot walk around it. We were as far away from the lobby as you can be, and it still only took 10 minutes to walk to it. If anything, the carts wizzing around constantly droping people off were a nusience and hazerdous.Definelty get the VIP package. Free massage and horse back riding. You get all the best liqours to drink (Blue Label!!), free rum and box of cigars. The consierge service is excellent, and worth the extra money not having to wait in line to get reservations.The night shows were excellent! Very fun...awesome dancing! Go ahead and participate in the night shows...they give you lots of free rum for taking part.Definelty go Parasailing and ATV'ing (Punta Cana Trails, is the best provider)...massages are a must :)All in all, I would most definetly go back to the Bavaro Princess, it is a perfect resort for all ages, and an amazing place for a honeymoon!Later!

<Content>Beautiful Beach - Resort Too Large We just returned from a 3 night Labor Day trip to the Bavaro Princess in Punta Cana, DR. My husband and I traveled there with our 3 children (ages 10, 4, 2), my sister and her family of 3, and my parents and 2 brothers. My husband and I honeymooned in the DR 5 years ago at the Sunscape Casa Del Mar in LaRomana, and my sister honeymooned in Punta Cana 2 years ok. Because of this, we knew what to expect. The resort itself is very, very large. The lobby is enormous and includes the stage for shows, the Hispaniola Buffet, a Piano Bar and several shops. Check-in was a bit chaotic, and even though I emailed 2 times for rooms near the beach, we were placed in the middle of the resort, which actually ended up being quite convenient. The beach is a long walk from the lobby (15 - 20 min). The trams were often crowed and very inconvenient if travelling with children/strollers, etc... We ended up doing a lot of walking! Definitely not a resort for anyone that has disabilites or problems walking.The rooms were nicely appointed and layed out. We did have some tiny ants in the bathroom and bar area, but these are to be expected in such a climate. I felt the room to be clean in general, and was not disappointed.The food was pretty terrible, almost unedible. The fountain drinks all had a very weird flavor to them. We lived on rice and french fries, but you don't go to the DR for the food. The meal at El Pescador was the best. We had grilled Lobster which was truly delicious. The staff was very friendly at all restaurants and would greet our children with a friendly Hola!The scenery is absolutely amazing, beautiful and unforgettable. The beach is wide and clean and there are ample chairs both there and at the pool. No one in our group got sick, which was a bonus!We would not return to this hotel because it was entirely too large for our taste and we didn't like the whole tram set-up. We will probably return to LaRomana at some point, but not back to this area again. However, we did enjoy ourselves immensely.

<Content>Great place to Visit Have just returned from a weeks stay and we all enjoyed our stay. We have a 6 yr old son and although we live in Spain we are British.  The whole resort was perfect and we had no complaints at all during our stay. while it is a 5 star resort, here in spain it would probably only get a 3 star rating, saying that the rooms, landscape, staff, pools and beaches are all amazing and certainly made it an enjoyable stay. We were told that the hotel was only about half full so i imagine at peak periods things will get a bit busy especially in the buffet and on the trams to get you about.  We did walk up and down the beach and the Bavarro certainly had the best beach and looked the best maintained. This is certainly a holiday to enjoy and to relax, and if you remember that one vital word and do Relax you will have a great stay.

<Content>Great Vacation at Bavaro Princess Resort Our family (consisting of four adults) just returned from a one week vacation at the Bavaro Princess Resort in Punta Cana (Dominican Republic). Prior to staying at the Bavaro Princess, we spent one week in the summer of 2003 at Natura Park (also in Punta Cana). Although we liked both of these resorts, we plan on actually returning to the Bavaro Princess next August.When first arriving at the Bavaro Princess, we were somewhat overwhelmed at the hustle/bustle of activity we encountered in the main lobby. The Bavaro Princess is an enormous resort (686 suites and another 90 jr. suites up by the lobby), and the intimacy we liked so much at Natura Park was definitely missing at Bavaro Princess. Bavaro Princess is also a far larger resort in terms of acreage; the resort is situated on 96+ acres, and people use trams to travel from one area of the resort to another. Natura Park is much smaller geographically, and everything is an easy walk away.Bavaro Princess is a more plush resort, however. The lobby was gorgeous -- marble and comfortable sitting areas everywhere, along with multiple gardens, fountains and birds galore (parrots, flamingoes, egrets, ducks, geese, peacocks and other tropical birds). We had requested non-smoking, second story rooms in the same vicinity (with king size beds), and our intial email requests had not been granted. We asked at once to have our three rooms changed, and even though the hotel was at full capacity, after about one hour our room change requests were honored. We were assigned to rooms 727, 728, and 737 (all within a stone's throw from the beach -- wonderful location!)The suties themselves were gorgeous! Again, they had marble floors, they were clean and very attractive, and they were very spacious. We've stayed at ten all-inclusive resorts, and these suites were the second best we've very had (only surpassed by a suite in Mexico which had its own jacuzzi right in the living area). The beds were comfortable (Natura Park's beds were very hard), and our maid, Yolanda, was the best!The grounds at Bavaro Princess were exquisite -- the gardeners did a wonderful job keeping everything in immaculate condition. Whenever we were walking about, a gardener would stop and ask if we'd like a coconut. There were many free roaming birds of multiple types everywhere, along with a smaller number of feral cats wandering the grounds. While we were at Bavaro Princess, some construction/improvement work was being done in the bird sanctuary; we never did see the mini-zoo, which I understand is very small. The grounds at Natura Park were also very beautiful, just much smaller in size. Both resorts pride themselves on their aesthetic atmosphere.By far, Bavaro Princess' greatest asset was its GORGEOUS beach. The beach itself is extremely wide and long (far wider than Natura Park's beach). There were thatched huts everywhere, which totally protected one from the tropical sun. Like Natura Park, people reserved beach areas in the morning by placing towels in select locations. This system, although not formally endorsed by Bavaro Princess, seemed to work very well. We never had a day without ample chairs AND use of a thatched hut. The sea breeze was so refreshing!The ocean at Bavaro Princess was amazing! There were definitely more wave action here (as compared with Natura Park which was situated on a calm bay). The waves were gentle and soothing, however, and it made being in the water lots of fun. Bavaro Princess does not have the same seaweed problem that Natura Park had. The sand was sugar white and always cool to the touch. I'm not sure that I've ever seen a better beach anywhere, and we have extensively travelled through the Caribbean and Hawaii.The pool at Bavaro Park, although huge, seemed a little dirty to us (and definitely very noisy). We only spent about an hour at the pool during the entire vacation, which suited us just fine. Natura Park's pool was much smaller and equally as undesirable for our tastes.Like Natura Park, most of the hotel guests were Europeans (predominantly from Spain, France and some from Germany). During our week's stay at Natura Park, we only met one other couple from America; everyone else was from Europe or South America/Mexico/Cuba. At Bavaro Princess, there were many guests from the United States and Canada, and hearing/speaking English was not such a rarity. It's just that the Europeans (mostly Spanish-speaking people) were definitely in the vast majority throughout our stay. As many others have noted, we did find several of the Spanish and French guests to lack civility (in other words, they were oftentimes quite RUDE). We tried our best to ignore them.The food at Bavaro Princess was really quite good on a whole, although some restaurants were definitely better than others. Our least favorite would be the main buffet, La Hispaniola. We ate dinner there once, plus a couple of lunches, and we were generally not impressed. Chopin Restaurant (a much smaller buffet) was far better, and we chose to eat breakfast there every morning. Chopin was closer in proximity to the suites, plus it was far less crowded. The food was really quite good as far as buffets go. You did have to make reservations to eat dinner at Chopin's.Unlike Natura Park where you could only eat at an ala carte restaurant twice in a one-week stay, you could make reservations six times at Bavaro Princess. We did not have the VIP plan, and we didn't really think we needed it. The one real advantage to their VIP program is the VIP concierge service near the suites. All other guests must go to the front lobby every other day (around 8:00 AM) to sign up for a la carte restaurants. If you were not there by 8:15 AM, you could not get a la carte reservations for that particular night. This was somewhat inconvenient, but the VIP plan would have cost us $105 more per person, and the VIP concierge service was really the only service that we wished we had been able to have. The other perks in the VIP package, although nice, were certainly not things we would have opted for.Our favorite a la carte restaurant was El Pescador (the seafood restaurant). The grilled lobster was wonderful, and we're from Maine where good lobster is readily available! We also liked El Gaucho (Argentine steakhouse). We tried the t-bone steaks and one in our party had the filet. Both entries were excellent. Our least favorite a la carte restaurant was Sakura (Asian bistro). It had the distinct advantage of being air-conditioned, but the dishes were very mediocre and the servings were quite small. We never tried the Italian a la carte restaurant, nor did we ever go to Licey's (their gourmet restaurant with a $25 per person surcharge, which we have been told was really not worth the extra money). Lunches were decidely better at Natura Park; we missed their Tex/Mex entries. Bavaro Princess did have a very good snack bar, however (McPrincess). Their pizza was marginal; we would not recommend it. Their ice cream selection was wonderful, although due to the heat/humidity, it was very often quite soft/melted. All in all, we were very pleased with the food selections.A few downsides to staying at the Bavaro PrincessL first of all, there is the sheer enormity of the place. It is certainly NOT like staying at an intimate hotel where employees get to know their guests. The physical size of the resort was not really problematic for us, although we have read other complaints from past guests about this very fact. The 96+ acres were extremely beautiful and immaculately well-maintained. My only complaint would be that the resort needs to have MORE TRAMS available at certain peak hours in order to accommodate all guest who need a ride from one end of the resort to the other. If you tried to catch a tram somewhere in the middle of the resort, it was next to impossible at certain times during the day. You would have to wait a long time or resort to walking. A shortage of tram space only seemed to encouage the pushing from impatient guests. Many did not take turns in getting on trams, etc. When the hotel is filled to capacity like it was when we were there, the resort really needs to add more trams to accommodate their clients.Another downside is the resort's gym. It was not air-conditioned, and the gym equipment was very sparse. My husband likes to use free weights, which were not available. The gym, in his estimation, could definitely use some major improvements.The stores at the resort were far more expensive than those at Natura Park (which were really very reasonable). Consequently, we were forced to bargain at the Bavaro Plaza in order to bring home souvenirs for family. My son requested Davidoff cigars (made in the DR), and he swears that those cigars that we pruchased at the Bavaro Plaze were fakes. Apparently, that IS a problem in the DR! Buyer beware!!! The hotel wanted $175 (American money) for one medium-sized box of Davidoff cigars. The only store at Bavaro Princess which seemed to have fair prices was their supermarket.These few negatives aside, however, we had a WONDERFUL TIME at the Bavaro Princess Resort, and we definitely plan on returning to the same location next August. We might even bring along some additional family members. The Dominican people were so gracious and hospitable, and we eagerly look forward to returning to Punta Cana AND the Bavaro Princess Resort! If you decide to visit this resort, we feel very strongly that you will not be disappointed...

<Content>Very Lush! My first impression approaching the lobby of the resort was okay. As we proceeded through the lobby we realized how big it was. The floor in the lobby had different elevations with dozens of sitting areas throughout. Then after checking in we walked past the lobby and discovered a courtyard. I couldn't help but to think how unimpressive the courtyard appeared. It didn't have an aesthetic appeal. This courtyard is where the evening entertainment occured. Eventually we hopped onto a trolley and was dropped off at our suite. I fell in love with the landscape, the lush vegetation and the suites. There are 8 suites per building. Each building looked like a villa. Very private! It was gorgeaous! Each suite had a private balcony with vegetation sorrounding the balcony for privacy. As you walk into the room, you get a living room and kitchenette. The bedroom is elevated and centered behind two columns. The vanity and bathroom is in a different section of the room alltogether. I really loved our suite except for....the extremely firm mattress and the plumbing issue that flooded the vanity area of our room. Every night we had to drop towels on the floor. We complained and no offer was made to change us to a different room. We also discovered the sofa had a pull out bed. Which we had to use one night because I couldn't sleep another night on the firm mattress (more like a wood board)!The resort was enormous! Many winding paths throughout. You'll need to use the map for the first two or three nights to get a sense of direction. Trolley cars pass by every 5 or 10 minutes. Which leads me to say that although the trolleys are a definite requirement for this huge resort.....the exhaust from these trollies took away from the EDEN like place. Must acquire a low emissions feul run trolleys. I really hated to breathe while sitting in these cars. There were plenty of restaurants to eat from and each had it's own ambiance and aesthetic appeal. I hate to say this.....I love eating and my husband especially, but I wasn't crazy about the food in any of these restaurants. I was very finicky about eating some of the meats, poultry or fish. If it doesn't look right, I won't eat it. MY husband ate everything in site and he definitely got food poisoning! He thinks it was the mussels he ate around the 2nd or 3rd night. LUCKILY, as nice a wife that I am, I insisted that we don't go to D.R. without getting a prescription of antibiotics in case of food poisoning. Even though he swore he wouldn't get sick, because it never happened to him before. HE GOT SICK! He had diahria and vomiting at the same time. After that he took the antibiotics, he was completely healed 24 hours later. A little weak the next day but 80% recuperated! From then on we made careful selections of the foods we ate. Although I didn't get sick like he did, I had a very mild case of diarhea, but controlled. I was okay. The beach was perfect! Beautiful, picturesque, breathtaking, heaven sent. Sand was almost white but felt like flour under my toes. No seaweed or jelly fish. The waves were mild, the water almost crystal blue, it was truly beautiful. I have negative to say about the beach. PERFECTION!Evening entertainment was very good. I feel the guest diploma awards is a waste of time. We're not going to go home and frame it! Have more evening crowd participation, every night. That should be part of the evening shows as well. The staff were friendly and nice. I just want to make a very important suggestion...the men in the entertainment staff.....after a show and you begin dancing with guests, please change into a fresh dry clean shirt. You guys were drenched in sweat, it was totally gross when I was dancing with a couple of you. Have backup shirts for the evening..please!Here are the negatives:-exhaust from trolleys-food was poor quality-hard mattress-some flooding issue in our bathroom-unattractive courtyard for nightly entertainment-silly awards everynight for guests waste of entertainment time frame-very little crowd participation (need more evening games)-the animal sanctuary lacked animals, where are they? Why isn't someone working in there?

<Content>great vacation Overall we had an absolutely wonderful vacation. I think I have traveled quite a bit and feel I can give the Bavaro Princess a fair review. As everyone said the beach and pool were amazing. probably the best pool I have been to. we never went without a chair no matter what time of day it was. we may have had to look around a little but always found one. Granted I did not look for the shaded ones because I love the sun! The food was decent. I have had better at places like sandals but also paid twice as much there. I could always find something and wonder about people who couldn't. It is true that they use alot of oil. In fact at the Mc Princess I got a chicken sandwhich and while cooking they poured a ladle of oil over the top. and yes they do deep fry the hot dogs. the burgers reminded me of school burgers. but I always liked them as a kid and they werent too bad now either. The buffet was good but repetitive as others reported but there are enough other restaurants that it was not an issue for us. Licey was my favorite. My husband liked the steak restuarant the best. we also ate at the oriental and the seafood, which were also good. we did not get to eat at bella pasta or chopin for dinner. As everyone had reported there is not alot of english so even the translation on the menus was not always clear. like I had no idea what Golf dressing or Mernier sauce was. We did not get sick at all and the only precaution I took was not drinking tap water.No problems with the service. Everyone was very helpful and friendly and tried very hard to communicate with us despite the fact we dont speak much spanish.the rooms were ok. I loved the set up. the beds were up a few steps between two poles. they left fresh flowers each day which was nice. the refridgerator was stocked and when we ran out we just called and they restocked promptly. One night we even came back to fresh fruit and two plates. sometimes our room cleaning or turn down service was missed but I think it had to do with our timing of when we were in the room. It was not a big deal to us anyway. Definately not something to ruin our trip. There was a slight smell by the sink area and a few ants but they seemed to stay in that area. The rooms could use a little updating, paint job ect. but overall nothing that was a big deal to us.we took the marinarium snorkeling trip which was great. we snorkeled with nurse sharks and sting rays and saw lots of other fish too. afterwards they took us to an area to swim that might be the most beautiful beach I have ever seen.VIP definately worth it. we only paid 15$ a person more. the massage alone is worth that. we did not do the horseback riding. It also includes dinner at Licey the gourmet restaurant. Otherwise it is $25 a person. I saw others standing in line each morning at 8am to make reservations for dinner. In fact we went to that desk one morning not knowing and only had one option for dinner that was available. then they told us we had a separate concierge for VIP. we went there and made all our reservations for dinner for the entire week anywhere we wanted. with the exception of Licey. they make that one for you. The other great thing about it was top shelf liquor. My husband was drinking budweiser bottles and could only get that because of being VIPThe grounds are very large. I think my personal preference is a smaller resort. But it is beautiful. we were close to the beach and pool which was nice. it was about a 15 min walk to the lobby. we never had to wait to catch a tram and if we choose to walk the scenery was nice. there was a sewage smell at one part as others reported but again nothing to ruin your vacation over.I saw lots of complaints about the european travelers. it is true that it is only about 10% american. I did not find them rude at all but I have lived in another country and realize that not everyone is like me. I cant believe that it never occurs to people that cultures are different. what is rude in one culture is normal to another. I am sure we as americans do offensive things without realizing it also. That attitude is the exact reason people dont like americans. we are so ego-centric that we expect everyone to act just like us and go to another country and expect them to speak english to us. If you dont want to experience another country, language and other cultures then the dominican republic is not for you. But if you have and open mind and want to experience something different from home, it is a wonderful vacation. I loved it.hope this helps. oh, one more thing dont pay attention to any weather forcast. I was very worried because rain was predicted everday but we did not see one drop.

<Content>Fabulous Beach - Grand Hotel We had a wonderful time in Punta CanaThe Princess Bavaro Suites was a very nice resort with a fabulous beach. If you have any knowledge of Spanish it will be really useful because the staff's use of English is quite limited. This does not get in the way of their warmth, service or hospitality. We even got to see a beautiful wedding the staff organized.My husband and I did not opt for the VIP package and I don't think we missed a thing. I would make dinner reservations each morning for that same night and/or the next. There were various seatings available at almost all the a la carte restaurants. The Animacion staff had numerous activities going on all day along the beach and around the pool. Our main goals was to rest and try as many of the different cocktails as possible. Favourites were - Cai Perina (?) and Coco Loco. We enjoyed all the restaurants (although we did not go to the Asian Sakura). The Hispaniola is the regular buffet style restaurant with a wide selection of dishes including a pasta bar and a meat/fish grill stn. Chopin is a higher end buffet with finer gourmet dishes and requires reservations. Bella Pasta (Italian) was very good - the pastas were almost as good as homemade (we're Italian g) I had a beautiful fish stew and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his lamb chops. There is also an Argentinean Grill and El Pescador , fish specialties. We were not disappointed at any. The bar tenders are very friendly and generous - especially if you offer a tip (US$1- $2/day) at the beginning of your order, they'll look after you all day! We left housekeeping $1 /day, a friendly thank you note and some candy. Our fridge was often stocked with an extra beer or 2 and sheets changed daily. On one ocassion the room had not be made up when we got back from the beach at 4pm. I called housekeeping and the staff was there in less than 10 minutes prepared to clean the room. The poor woman was so apologetic explaining there was a very high number of checkouts that day. Her working partner was prepared to give her a hand, but we explained we were not cross and she could take all the time she needed. My only criticism was that a large part of the evening entertainment was focussed on children and by the time the adult music and dancing started (after 11) we were too tired from a day in the sun. But it certainly didn't hinder our fun. We would go back to our suite, watch some American TV, fall asleep before midnight and be raring to go early the next morning.You may want to note: Occasionally there is a slight odour of stale water. I think it's b/c they water the grass and plants with pond water. For this reason avoid units in the 200 block - they are near the watering stn.Trams can take you around the complex but are sometimes crowded. My husband and I walked everywhere and didn't mind at all.All in all it was a wonderful vacation.Would we go back? Only after I have visited ALL the other places on my dream list - and then yes - I would return.

<Content>Great place to take a family vacation! Got back Aug 14 from a one week stay. Had a really relaxing holiday with my husband and 3 year old! Room was big and clean, resort was huge and beautiful, and staff was very nice and tried their best to be helpful and accommodating even with the language barrier. The clown show every night was great for the kids! Food was good considering you were in another country which people seem to forget for some reason (You are not at home for all those complaining!!!) El Gaucho steaks were the best, Bella Pasta pizza  pasta to die for and the buffets had something for everyone everyday - even my really picky son!) McPrincess had burgers, hot dogs and fries for all the picky people. Hi-light of the vacation was the amazing beach! Try to book a room closer to the beach - we were by the main building which was no problem because the trolleys would come every few minutes. I would recommend this place to anyone for a little R  R! Enjoy - we did!

<Content>Stayed at the Bavaro Princess Aug. 15-22, 2004 Last year, we went to Sandals Royal Bahamian Resort and Spa and we were sooo impressed. Naturally, we have very high expectations for the next resort. So my experience at Bavaro may have been tainted with constant comparisons to Sandals. In any case, here's my review:Check-in: It was done in five minutes, no sweat. BUT, we were told that the rooms wouldn't be ready until 3 p.m. So we went to lunch and did some walking around. Around 3 p.m. we went to the counter and was told that the room wouldn't be ready for another 35 minutes because the people left late. I was hot and tired and was therefore very upset by the news. They offered us another room but I wasn't about to pass up on the room we were waiting for. So we waited. When the 35 minutes was up, we went back to the counter with renewed hope only to be told to wait another 20 minutes! I was sooo mad by then! So we walked to the front and found our luggage exactly where we left it three hours earlier. Only then that we were told that we could go to our room. What a nightmare! It probably wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't so hot!Resort: At 96 acres, bring comfy sandals and plan to walk a lot (in spite of the trams provided for transportation as empty seats are hard to come across at peak times). Be warned that the only place that has air-conditioning is YOUR room and that people smoke EVERYWHERE! - including restaurants and pools! Other than that, it is absolutely beautiful! It's very clean and the landscaping is impeccable.Staff: Most are good and very respectful. But the friendliest bunch are the maids, bartenders and waitstaff. A dollar or two will get you an even more superb service the next time they see you.Pool: Large and clean. It can be overcrowded, but I like it that way because it gives it a lively feeling. There were a lot of shallow ends - perfect for the little ones. The swim-up bar had the best pina coladas. But if you want chairs, get up between 7 and 8 and hang your towels on your chosen spot, otherwise, good luck finding any for the rest of the day! Same with the beach area.Beach: It was packed with topless women of all shapes and sizes. But it is a beautiful beach. I was impressed.Suite: Wow. It was huge! The pictures in the Bavaro sites does not do it any justice. We had minor ant problems here and there, but nothing that a quick squirt of Skintastics spray couldn't fix. But the smell in the washroom could be gross sometimes. I think it's the pipes linking to the sink. The sheets weren't bad but I religiously sprayed it with Febreeze before each use and it helped a lot. The mini-bar in the VIP was stocked daily. And any services required for the room was met in an instant. Our maid was Jocelyn and she was a very sweet lady. We always got extra towels, extra bottled water and always got our room cleaned early.Bars: I only went to the one at the Lobby and the swim-up bar in the main pool. And let's just say that it's a complete waste of time to go to the one in the Lobby. And if you're a smoker, you can buy cigaretttes for a cool dollar at the swim-up bar. Gift shop: Can you say rip-off? The lady tried to charge us $25 US for a normal bottle of sunblock!RESTAURANTSBella Pasta: I was expecting a good selection of pastas. Well, I only had two to choose from everyday and it was the same sauce everyday - Alfredo and Tomato and no meat whatsoever. The rest were fruits, vegetables and pizzas.Mac Princess: Tasty chicken and beef burgers. But please do tip the poor guy (a dollar will do) that spends 12 hours a day in front of the hot grill everyday.El Gaucho: Sausage was good and that's it. Steak was so-so.Chopin: Awww, I was looking forward to this restaurant since it got so many great reviews. My personal review for it? It sucked and it's totally over-rated.La Hispaniola: This is the only restaurant open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. But do get up early since it closes at 10 a.m. Try the smoothies and donuts. Licey: We had reservations as part of VIP package. But what good would it do for anyone with children if you can't bring your kids with you? Our daughter is 2. What were we supoosed to do with her? So we skipped it altogether.Tourists: It was a gold-mine to find people who spoke English! The majority are Europeans (like many people said in here) and I experienced first-hand just how rude these Europeans are. It's like they own the place! And not once have I ever heard anyone who has knocked me over or cut in front of me say the words SORRY or Excuse me - even in their language!VIP package:- didn't get bathrobes, but got lots of extra towels- steps to the main pool and beach- massage was good, but it was hardly relaxing what with the sound of the tram, people walking by and the lawnmower going off in the background.For us, just being near the pool, having extras of everything and having nightly turn-down service was worth it.Check-out: Easy as 1-2-3.Overall, this resort is perfect in some ways, but it could be better in many other ways.

<Content>a very good hotel I really recommeded Barcelo bavaro princess for a good and enjoyable vacation. My boyfriend and I spend 10 days which were beautiful. First, very good food for instance, el pecador with the lobster on the grill. second el gaucho with el churascho or la parrillada argentina. in addition, the beach is beautiful and the entertaiment people work very hard to keep the huespedes busy. Moreover, the disco at night with the entertaiment people was very nice. the rooms which i stay was #375 it was well decorated of course you can find that the sink in the bar was not working or a cokrauch was around which i kill but this not spoiled my vacation. The refrigerator always filled with water, soda and beer. i read some review which people complain about cucaracharas but i will ask them in which will city you do not find cucarachas just if you leave in the moon. the location was very convinience because el gaucho and el pescador( we ate lobster for almost a week) was a few minutes away. I really recommeded this hotel

<Content>Loved the Bavaro Princess I just came back from my stay at the Bavaro Princess Resort in Punta Cana. I personally felt that this is a trip that is a well kept secret. I have taken many trips before, to Jamaica, the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, Mexico, etc. but have found that this is my favorite place to visit. I plan to return next year. Why? The resort is beautiful, a natural rainforest, the service was wonderful. There are seven different restaurants along with the buffet. The buffet was okay. You had the same foods served each day. The workers are so pleasant. They try so hard to please you. If you like grilled lobster and shrimp, go to the seafood restaurant. Before I took this trip, I read the reviews on this resort, and became nervous because some of the reviews said this was not a place they would want to come to again. They are wrong. I was treated so well. Maybe it was their attitude toward the workers. They always greeted me with a smile.As far as comments, about bringing face towels, I brought my own, but found I really didn't need to. They don't use face towels there. You get a hand and bath towel daily, along with a robe. Also, upgrade to the VIP package when you arrive there. It's worth it. It includes a massage, horseback riding, your better alcohol, a bottle of rum and box of cigars. As far as excursions, take the Monster Safari. I would highly recommend that trip if you are adventurous and want to see how the people live. Take a bag of gifts for the children on that trip. One lady had a bag of notebooks, crayons, glue and bags of wrapped candy to give to the children. The children appreciated anything you gave them. I even took my earrings off, and gave them to one girl with pierced ears. I gave away my ink pen that lit up, and even my box of Velamints. Buy shoes if you can. There were children without shoes. Some children asked for our shoes. I cried seeing so many children, and looking at how they lived. Many families in the rural areas make only $5.00 a week picking sugar cane. Education is not required of the children. I plan to return next year, better prepared. I didn't get a chance to take the tour that was offered to Santo Domingo. I was told that that is another tour that shows you the culture and lifestyle of the Domincans. The only downside of the trip was not being able to speak Spanish. Before you go, take a Spanish dictionary. It was sometimes difficult communicating with the people.

<Content>Nothing lost, nothing gained. I just returned home after a week at the Bavaro Princess in Punta Cana. I tried to keep in mind that I was in another country and not the United States and, therefore, would probably not get the level and quality of service that I was hoping for and accustomed to. With this in mind, I'd have to say there were some pluses, and some minuses.I have to state that I was impressed with the quality of food at the buffet. I rarely vacation at an all inclusive resort. In fact, I believe this was only my third time. However, I have to say that the food was actually pretty good compared to what I've experienced before, and to other reports that I've read. The only down side is that breakfast was the same every day that I was there.The other plus is that the grounds were actually beautiful and well maintained. It is also a very large property as far as size goes, but there is a small trolley like mode of transportation that runs until 3am in the morning, and runs the length of the property. So, getting around was not as laborious as I had been led to believe in another report.The downside; my room was over-run by microscopic bugs that were adamant about sharing my bed, in addition to something else that appeared to be winged ants that were content to just share the room. My sheets were changed only once during my stay, and the blanket smelled as if it hadn't been changed in months. The cleaning crew was certainly lacking in quality. After I used up the bath soap I had to ask for additional bars. Most places that I've been to would replace them as they are used. I also used up my laundry bags and forms and had to ask for additional ones.Finally, I'd have to say that service varied. At times I encountered staff who were most helpful, and other times I was left with the impression that I had no business asking for assistance. Overall, It was a decent experience. I have certainly had better, and I've had worse. Admittedly, I will return. But, that's only because I enjoyed Punta Cana, and the Bavaro Princess is the only location that my vacation package has available to me.

<Content>good time for cheap bucks Great beach alot of activities all day long breakfest great lunch good, dinner in sakura ,licey very good also they are air conditioned thats a big plus. Remember your in another country,this resort caters to mostly people from spain pourtgal  other spanish speaking peoples from around the world. The food you get is basically for their tastes. You will have a good time if your not closed minded. Music is playing all day long its impossible not to dance in the pool on the beach or in the hotel lobby. Dont be cheap upgrade your package to vip its worth the extra money. Fishing from the beach in the early mornings will get you snook tarpon, jack cravelles from 6am to 8am then it dies too much water acctivities. Will return again .

<Content>Wonderful Place to stay I had to write this review in respond to one I just read from Brooklyn, NY. Let me tell you I stayed in Bavaro Princess from June 27 thru July 4, 2004. I traveled with a group of 19. We all had a wonderful time. You can't ask more for your money. The staff is great, very courtious, helpful and respectful. All our rooms were cleaned daily and when we called the customer service they responded the same day. Of course we were all very polite to the workers and always tipped them. Travelers have to see that this is a huge resort and the employees are overworked but they always go beyond there way to help. I would recommend this resort in a heartbeat.

<Content>For a bad time, call Bavaro Princess I just returned from the Bavaro Princess. Stayed from 7/25 - 8/1. The hotel staff was not receptive towards any questions or concerns. I contacted the VIP coordinator on several occasions to have issue's resolved and the problems continued. I booked a King Size bed and when i arrived they pushed 2 double beds together. I asked why they did not give me the king size and they said that none was available. I met a couple by the beach that checked in 3 hours after i did and they had a king size bed. I asked the VIP coordinator for a new iron because the one in the room was broken. After returning from a day on the beach, the iron was not replaced. They did not clean our room on several occasions. When I asked the reason for this they stated that we had left the do not disturb sign on the door. That was a complete lie. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Brilliant Holiday The Bavaro Princess Hotel was fantastic i had a brilliant time and so did my daughter and grandaughter! The hotel was very clean and the rooms were lovely! When we had a problem with our sink I pointed it out to the maid and it was fixed within 10 minutes. The rooms was kept very clean and we were left clean towels and our beds were made every day. Our fridge was refiled every day with water, seven-up, coke and beer. the beach was out of this world and the pool was brilliant too! The bartenders and waiters/es were lovely and would have gone out of their to make you happy! The animation staff by the pool were so nice the entirtainment they provided by the pool and on the beach everyday was brilliant and hailourous! My grandaughter loved the animation staff and they made her holiday! The food was goregeous and they catered to your every need lunch was my favourite as there was an incredible amount to choose from there desserts were lovely to! The entirtainment at night was fantastic the dancers, costumes and dance routines were out of this world! After the show the dancers and the entirtainment staff would ask you to come and join in with there club dance they would then have a band and you could salsa with the staff or who you liked. After the band there was a night club on which my grandaughter enjoyed very much it would go on from 12 till 4! As I live in the Britian we flew with Tompsons! We done loads of trips. We done the encounter with dolphins at Ocean world which was quite dear but it was definately worth the money! We done the Safri which brought you to a typical Dominican house, a fruit plantation, a sugarfield plantation and then we got to go and see the poor children if you think about going on this trip it would be a good idea to bring some small presents eg. pencils, shampoo bottles from hotel etc. But the best part of the holiday was definately the hotel I would recomend this hotel to anybody! It was fantastic I would go back in the morning if I could I had a brilliant holiday!!! Anne

<Content>bavaro princess beautiful beach. pool and resort just arrived back from the bavaro princess, stayed there from july 18-july 25. arrival want terrific, i upgraded my package to vip and it was ok but if you dont need a robe or the turining down of your bed, the junior suite is terrific also. i was in bungalow 39 only 2 minutes from the beach, beach towels are only supplied the first day, so after that you have to go to the beach to get towels, not a big problem. the beach and the pool are beautiful, and the water arobics with ricardo was a blast boy could he move that body. as for the topless bathing you will see a lot of that little girls also. so dont be shocked.the food was great at least for me didn't get sick but be careful of the coconut water from the coconut that you can have someone get you from the trees growing all around the resort, it really gave me a pain in my stomach but i cure myself real fast ( purged it from my stomach if you know what i mean (lol). my stay there was a blast i met so many people from all over the word, i mean nice people, ex. venuzela, italy, france, louisana, england, holland, and my new found friends, harlem ny. while you are there you must try the outback safari that was the most interesting and fun trip you will meet the people of d.r., i took some school supplies and candy and gave them to a grandmother with 12 grandchildren, just to see the smile on her face and the smile of the children really touched my heart.the bartenders were great my favorite, ruben and francesco. you can sense from them the tips were greatly appreciated, some guest complained that if they didnt give a tip the bartenders were very rude, i didnt find that.as for the dining the restaurants they were ok one night i missed my reservations fell alseep too many coco loco's (have to try these terrific), i went to the beach area where there are about three restaurants, they were so nice they made me a pizza without a reservation.the last day me and some of the people i met there had a problem at bella pasta , but sometimes it not the restaurant but the people they have working there, just leave the restaurant if you are not pleased.all in all i had a ball and would reccommed this resort for relaxation and fun, even though it is a family resort, the children were not a problem.oh i may have forgotten to mentioned i traveled alone and had a ball so dont be afraid all you single traveler's i was safe and met many people who refused to let me be alone. have fun.

<Content>Best holiday ever!!!!! Recently back from this hotel and it was a definate ten out of ten! Meeting the staff and the dominican people was definately the best part of holiday. The food was fabulous and they catered to your every need. The animation staff by the pool and the beach were so friendly and they would have done anything for you! The rooms were lovely and very spaced out and anything you asked for you got within minutes! I would recommend this hotel to anybody from familys to couples. It was the best holiday ever!!!

<Content>Enjoyed the stay but not a true 5 star resort I just came back from Bavaro Princess yesterday. We spent a week there and overall I enjoyed the stay. The resort is huge and beautiful - all the grounds/ponds are well kept and the beach is nice and clean. However, I was a bit disappointed that only in the rooms there is air-conditioning. Most of the restaurants including the lobby and bars are open-aired. It was so hot and humid there that I couldn't quite stand the heat.As for the rooms, don't expect a 5 star room as it is only a Days Inn/Quality Inn standard. We had a problem with our shower but they sent a guy in to fix within 10 minutes so it was good.I didn't have any problems with the food except that I found them too salty and greasy at times. Don't waste your time at the Sakura restaurant as the Asian food was a joke. I was suprpised to see raw oysters in one of the buffets, which was a plus. I like the breakfast buffet, lots of variety and selections, especially the freshly blended fruit juice and made-to-order omelettes.Staff are generally friendly and speak a little English. Night shows were ok to kill time after dinner, but don't expect too much.I didn't see people being rude there. I think it's simply culture difference as most of them are European/Spanish speaking people. Topless women are all over the place at the beach, didn't bother me but I was surprised to see that many including topless girl kids!I'd recommend people to stay in Bavaro Princess but I won't go back anymore....want to try something more on the luxury side next time.

<Content>excellent place to go we spent the fourth of july weekend at the Bavaro Princess hotel. This hotel is a great place to go. The food was excellent and so were the staff. Most of the time we spent it in the pool and we loved it because there is a swim up bar in it, you can drink all you want. It was 6 of us and we all had a great time (no conplaints). I will recommend this resort to anybody but if you don't want to go to a big hotel this will not be the perfect one because it is huge. Everybody has a diffrent opinion but this place is wonderful and to that one guy that said that they stoled his movado watch, why would you leave any thing of value thrown around (thats why you have a safe in your room with a key) I will definetly go back. To make your vacation more exciting try going on excursions there great.

<Content>Great Fun  My husband and I, along with our two children (8  10) just returned from a week at the Bavaro Princess. We also went with my cousin  her husband, along with their two children. We all had a fantastic time because the kids played together and entertained themselves while we adults lounged by the pool bar, got massages, laid on the beach, etc. Most of the staff at the hotel was extremely friendly and accommodating. There was a landscaper outside our room the whole week who tried to give us coconuts which he cracked open. He wanted us to drink the milk  eat the fruit. Obviously, he wanted a tip. But hey, he needed the money more than we did so we accepted his offer many times. He was very sweet. Most of the people there speak little or no English so don't be an Ugly American and complain. Brush up on your Spanish or bring along a dictionary and try to communicate in their language. We upgraded to a Super VIP which was definitely worth it. We were literally right on the beach. Thankfully, we read enough here to know that was the thing to do. I read somewhere that the rooms near the sewerage facility smell awful. I can believe it. Riding thru that area on the tram was horrid. The only complaints I have about the resort are as follows: 1. The food all starts to taste the same. This is true with most All-Inclusives. If we stayed longer than one week, I would have gone crazy. We stopped at Burger King back in NJ on the way home! 2. The resort is too big. Yes, there are trams that run every 5 minutes or so but if there's a crowd waiting, you sometimes end up waiting a very long time. 3. Most of the restaurants are Open-Air. We saw birds come down to the buffet for a nibble here or there and then a person would come up and grab the very roll or chunk of fruit the birds were eating. Gross! 4. Be prepared to see lots of topless women. Of course, my husband  cousin's husband liked this. But our kids were uncomfortable and I was just plain tired of seeing it. Many of the French women looked almost nude. They'd be topless and then they'd roll down their thong bottoms way down. Not something you see every day. Even their young daughters (8 to 10 years old) wore no tops and little thongs. I know it's the European way, but some may find it offensive. Many people wrote on Trip Advisor that the people were rude. I did not find that to be true. The worst thing I saw was the chef in the McPrincess area who cooked up burgers  hot dogs in a little hut only served those who tossed money at him. This was very rude. I waited in line with about 20 other people. He didn't make eye contact with anyone. There were burgers on the grill that were done and ready to be passed out. Then along came a big jerk who tossed him a dollar. The chef held it up for all to see then gave the guy a big platter of food, as if to say if you want food, show me the money! I got so disgusted I walked away.But all in all, we enjoyed our stay the Bavaro Princess. If we go back to DR, we'll probably stay at the Iberostar or Paradus. I met some other people on the plane ride home and they said good things about those places. Of course, if we do decide to go, I will check them out on TripAdvisor.com!Thanks for reading. Hope some of my comments help you decide.

<Content>Would Go Back I read a lot of the reviews before going to Punta Cana and decided that I should just keep an open mind. We had no problems at the airport. There was no wait to clear customs. The trip to the resort was about 30 minutes. The Bavaro Princess was very nice. The resort is beautiful and the people are very friendly. We do not speak a lot of Spanish, but that was not a problem. We got in about three, so we went straight to our rooms. The room looked just like the picture on the website. The frig was stocked with soda, water, and beer. They do not supply face towels; so it is a good idea to pack a couple of colored face towels (thanks for the tip Mike and Monique). Bath and hand towels are provided.We did not swim in the pool, but we did lounge there the first day while sipping on drinks. We preferred the beach. Since Punta Cana sits on the Eastern tip, the waters are a mix of the Atlanta and Caribbean. So you still get seaweed in the water. So the water is not as clear as other Caribbean islands (and other beaches in DR).The FOOD. It was okay. Breakfast was not so great, but you can find something to eat. We liked the fruit, cereal, omelett bar, oatmeal.My best meal was at El Pescador. Try the lobster.Bella Pasta - Italian. I had the lamb. It was good. My friends hated the lasagna. The pizza was good, though.El Gaucico - Steak. No steak sauce. The beef fillet was good. No complaints.You can get coffee everywhere. It is great! I don't even like coffee.We hated eating at Hispanola, the buffet restaurant. You can eat here if you don 't have reservations at any of the other restaurants. Get something made to order at the grilling stations.There are places to eat all day. And we found out late that you don't have to go up to the main restaurant for breakfast or lunch. There are other places you can eat.MacPrincess - burgers, hotdogs, and fries opens at 11:00The review of the massages at the spa depends on who you had. Sometimes it is good, sometimes not.Don't buy cigars on the beach. They are fake. Buy them at Don Lucas. You can take a complimentary shuttle there.Try PARASAILING or THE BANANA BOAT. Fun FunPizzaria opens at noon.Oh yeah. Use your US dollars. No need to exchange a thing. Buy some coffee and some rum. Don't buy anything at the gift shop because the prices are ridiculously high.We booked an all-inclusive trip. I would not go any other way! I would go back to Punta Cana and even stay at the Bavaro Princess. The only complaint (if you would call it that) is that the nightly entertainment catered too much to children. Yes. This is a family-friendly hotel. You can catch a shuttle to the casion or disc at other hotels, but I would have preferred to be able to party at my own resort. The resort is big, but they have shuttles if you don't want to walk. Some reviews complained about getting lost. I don't see how. If you walk the grounds during the day, you can get a feel for how to get anywhere. Our room was near the beach (try to get one near the beach if you can). I went on this trip with a group of girlfriends. It was great. If I travel with my boyfriend, I prefer for an adults only or couples only hotel. The vacation will be what you make it!

<Content>Beautiful beach but be prepared.... My family ( my husband and 2 daughters 7  10) just returned last night. We had a wonderful vacation!! The beach is fabulous with beautiful pink sand. We had the VIP and our room was ocean view. Highly recommend the VIP for better room location and service. The rooms are older and not the cleanest but they are adequate. You need to remember that you are in another country and things are very different there. There was a huge language barrier. Very few staff members spoke English. When I tried to get my second massage the spa people wouldn't communicate with me they just kept saying No hablo Engles. That was not a very good experience. I would get ignored often at the bars ( I don't know why) but my husband had no problems. Don't go to this resort if you are expecting 5 stars. The nightly entertainment was horrible. My daughters would not go to the kid's club because they didn't speak english. The main pool entertainment was pretty good. We had a few laughs. The food is very different than the states. My husband got sick on our 5th day and he's actually at the doctor right now because he's had irritable bowel for five days. The worse part was my digital camera was stolen from El Gaucho and all our vacation pictures were on it. I am heartbroken. The staff tried to help us locate it but no luck. We even offered a reward. If you do go, I highly recommend the swimming with dolphins at Manati Park. That was the best! The Maranarium Snorkeling trip was awesome! The sailing and banana boat rides were a blast. Pool and beach fabulous. Go with an open mind, keep your hands on all valuables and don't try any food your are not sure about. Overall we had a wonderful trip but we would not return.

<Content>Honeymooning on the beach! My wife and I just returned from our honeymoon at the Bavaro Princess. We had a great time and are glad we chose this resort. Check-in was very easy. Our room was not ready when we arrived but we only had to wait ten minutes. The guys at the counter were great at explaining things to us. We walked to our room which had an ocean view! The grounds are beautiful. They work hard to make sure that nothing goes untouched and the whole resort was very pleasing to the eye. Considering all the sand that gets tracked into the restaurants and restrooms by the beach, I was amazed. Yes the resort is very large, but we enjoyed this aspect. It seemed like you were walking through a park. If you don't want to walk, there are several trams that will pick you up. The longest we ever had to wait was 10 minutes. The beach was absolutely beautiful and the water was a perfect temperature. I recommend paying the extra $ for a catamaran lesson (small sail boat) early in your stay. Then you can take the catamaran by yourself every day if you would like. They are a lot of fun. The room was very clean with a well stocked bar. The room was also much nicer and larger than what we expected. No problems with insects, smells, or cold water too! We left a couple US dollars and some trinkets every day for the made and got flowers and folded towels in return. They don't make much money so the small amount of money we gave was highly appreciated. The service was great. Everyone was very friendly and attentitive. Most of the employees knew some English and many knew 4 languages! Anyway, if you are patient with them, you can get pretty much anything you want. We got the VIP package and are glad we did. The massage was very nice and the meal at the Licey restaurant was excellent. The food at the rest of the restaurants was not much to speak for. My wife got sick about midway through and is still not feeling right after about 5 days. I was able to find things to eat, but never found anything that suited the American appetite. Just remember that the majority of people there are European, so the food is not targeted for Americans. Speaking of, you also have to be patient with our neighbors across the pond. Many were rude and impatient, but we just blew them off and enjoyed ourselves. Many also go topless on the beach. I was surprised by the number of topless women, but it did not discourage us from carrying on as normal. Those with children or that are closed minded might be offended, though. The nightly entertainment was poor to us. It was mostly in spanish and just was not at all entertaining, so don't waste your time. Check out was a breeze and again they picked up our luggage and took it to the front for us. Excellent service! While you are there, try the Mama Juana, Coco Loco, Banana Mama, and Banana Royal. Those are all great tasty drinks. One last warning, take snack foods to the airport. The Punta Cana airport charged us $3 for a can of Sprite and $4 for a can of Pringles. Overall, except for the sickness, we enjoyed ourselves. The resort was beautiful and so were the rooms. There's nothing like napping on the beach with a constant breeze blowing over you! Will we return? It's pretty unlikely. Are we glad we chose Bavaro Princess? Absolutely.

<Content>Consider this! As everyone has probably noticed, everyone has had different experiences at this hotel. People complain about room service (which i thought was awesome), others complain about how staff are not helpful. I guess people just look at it differently. First of all the scenery is beautiful and the hotel is amazing in appierence so that is definantly a plus. I just returned to toronto this afternoon. Service and staff- It really depends on what staff u run into, the animation team and bartenders are very friendly, but people in the lobby and front desk not as much. As well a lot of people have complained that some animation staff which are mainly in late 20's and eolder seem to hit on younger girls in their teen years. Kind of freaky at times but other then that the animation staff are not lazy and all their scedualed activities are always on time. Rooms- me and my family personal felt that our room was very well cleaned and big. We did have a problem with our refrigerator and pointed it out to the maid, she called some one and in about 30 minutes the fridge was replaced. So they are very good with things like that. As for cockaroches i don't know about that but i guess things like that happen. Its best to get rooms in the 30's very close to beach and restaurants..i stayed in 375 Food- Food was alright it depends on what restaurant you go to i liked el pescador and el guana the best. Thats all for now....Oh and one more thing, i met a guy there on my last day from new jersey, and his name i really cant remember i think it was cole or paul but i didnt get a chance to get his email so if he sees this some how..i left my email address--maria

<Content>Good but to big we arrived at bavaro princess and check in was faster then expected.Before arriving at the hotel we had been 4 day in iberostar hacienda domincus in la romanda which we liked better because it was a bit smaller.The food at bavaro princess was great.El pescador which is the seafood restaurant was excelente,even the buffet restaurant was good.The rooms are big and very clean.The pool and the beach are wounderfuland and so are the ground.The only thing we were not to happy with was that our room was far from pool and the restaurant .sometimes the bus would pass but it was full we had to wait or start walking which our daugthers didnt want to do . we had a good time .The show were very good for children and adults

<Content>Great Vacation We just got back from a week at the Bavaro Princess and thought that it was an excellent choice of vacation spots to go to and would go back in a heartbeat. The grounds were absolutely beautiful and the beach was out of this world. Make sure you go to the beach between 7-8 in the morning to get your chairs under an umbrella and reserve with towels etc... Trust me they will still be there even if you go in the afternoon and you`ll appreciate the break from the sun. The food was good especially at Bella Pasta (Spaghetti Al Vongole and the Argentinian Steak) and El Piscatore (Lobster). Also make sure you get a room either near the beach or in the hotel part which is near the lobby ( thats where we were and would get the same place again plus theres a pool right outside your balcony). If your room is in the middle of the property, you will either have to always walk a fair distance or have to wait for the bus that comes around all the time because its just too far to walk to either the beach or the lobby where the entertainment is. The grounds are huge!!! I would recommend this place highly.

<Content>Had a great time at Bavaro Princess I went to Bavaro Princess on Jue 12th with my enitire family, including my 2 kids, 4 and 22 months. The resort was amazing and the service was excellent. The rooms were huge, we had a crib and the pull out sofa for the kids and there was still plenty of room. We did have to wait a long time for our room but once we got it we were 2 buildings away for the beach and Restaurants, (El Guacho, El Pescador and Bella Pasta) I would definitely recommend you eat at El Guacho, El Pescador and El Chopin. These were the best from the ones that you needed to make reservations. We had the VIP so we never had problems making reservations, we were 15 people total. teh Hispanola is great it is not your typical buffet, they have different foods every night but Thursday is Dominican night (The best night). The kids program is great, the staff is great with the kids, and they have an evening clown show just for the kids. My family and I had a great time we will definitely return next year. I was pleasantly suprised after reading all those bad reviews.

<Content>We just came back yesterday from our dream vacations My husband, 6 year-old son and I spent a week at this beautiful resort. It was amazing!!! We had a great time. The hotel was just beautiful, the food was great, our room was very clean. And the service was just out of this world. We speak Spanish, but we saw that the employees make no difference. Everybody is treated the same way, just great. The beach was just breath taking. Clean, the sand, soft, did not burn your feet. And the water was the most beautiful I had ever seen.. I am pregnant and I never got sick. None of us got sick. We drank bottled water and ate the same food. The shows are just great!!!! and the animation staff is very hard working to keep you entertained day and night. We even had aerobics every day at the beach and in the pool. We had the best vacations so far and we will definetly come back later with our new baby.... It is a beautiful hotel. I recommend it.... If you have any questions, please send me an e-mail and I will answer your questions...

<Content>Best Vacation Ever We just got back from there, we traveled on 19Jun and left 7 days later. What a vacation ! To die for !Excellent place, rooms,food, all was great, the animators were the best thing the hotel had. They are greatgroup of people, My son sang Karaokee, he won twice in different contests, my hubby won in a beach sportgame, I am telling you, this place is the best all around, the trolley driver/Bell man - Alejandro Bonilla was a great great person. The landscaping men, would get you coconuts fresh off the trees, the maids would go out of their way, the food was excellent, I met reallly nice people there from all over the world. My kidsroamed the place every nite with friends they made, they are teenagers and had great fun.Thanks Bavaro Princess for making my vacation a great one !Nilda GutierrezMiami Florida

<Content>best beach in the area I would say the previous post had a bad experience. Resort grounds were beautiful, rooms fantastic, very nice pool, and the beach was the best in the immediate area (clean and wide). Our service was fantastic in the room. We left our service only a dollar a day and it may have made a difference - I don't know - but we had fresh towels and fresh flowers laid out everyday. The room and balcony were cleaned up after us and our mess.As for your missing watch, and cameras being stolen, it is anyone's best interests to ensure that these items are not left unattended or are put away in the safe.This resort was great! Food was OK, however there was variety to choose from. Meals cooked in front of you (fresh meats, omelettes, pasta) are the best. I am a picky eater, however I made out just fine. I would highly recommend this resort.

<Content>Beautiful hotel, bad service, worse experience After a week in Santo Domingo (Hotel Palacio greeat experience) and a week in a crusie in the Caribean, I spent a week in the Princess Bavaro resort (5 stars). The hotel is beautiful, the reception area is great, the room (suite) beautiful. Since the first day, I realized that the toilet was not working properly, they did not did anything to fix it. The bathroom was not really clean until the last day, and the maid did not really care too much as evidenced for my laziness and stuborness when I left a pen on the floor one day and I did not believe that it was not picked up when the room was cleant. That pen was there for three days until I picked it up myself. (5 stars hotel!!!!!)One day, my MOvado watch was stolen, I believe with 99% certainity that it was stolen by hotel employees. It took me three days to contact the management of the hotel. People sent me to one desk, and asked me to come back again and again. The third day like this, I found my room at 5:35 pm undone. I was fed up, so I went to front desk and I demanded to talk to the director. I was able to talkto the sub-director (Mr. Jesus Tabiega) who was very nice. He told me that he was looking into everything and the room actually got a lot cleaner. He offered to pay the extra money that we had to pay to go to the nice restaurant ( I was in an ALL Inclusive). I aagreed with him, but when I went to settle the bill, he had not authorized the payment and he was not place to be found. There was an Amrican working at the hotel who told me that three camers had receintly disappeared from the hotel beach, so be aware. Anyway, I don't recommend this hotel (my first time giving a negative review) contact me if you want more information.

<Content>The lovely Bavaro Princess  First off I'm shocked to see any of you writing in such awful manner about this resort. I have been travelling around the world for years. All over Europe, and now around here in Canada and the U.S. I can honestly say I NEVER experienced anything like these horror stories would tell you. I went to the Bavaro Princess two times (once the five of us, and once again that same year for Christmas with the kids) What can I say? The people complaining about the food-poisoning obviously had never read a travel guide stating DON'T DRINK THE WATER! Hell, they water the vegetables with it, animals drink it!!! If your system isn't used to the water, then yes, you will get sick for one-two days. Try to bear with the conditions of your room, the staff on the resort is doing everything to keep up with your demands. Besides these people live in shacks smaller that your bathroom!As for any other questions I will gladly answer them at vivicica@yahoo.comPlease don't hesitate to write!PS: I am also going to this same resort in December with our mothers, now would I drag them across the world to a resort like the one they painted a picture of above????

<Content>Where did the time go? We spent two weeks at the Bavaro Princess. The first (May 15th - 22nd) with 26 of our closest friends and family. We got married on the 20th and enjoyed the second week (until May 29th) solo.First off, the beach IS magnificent. The sand is like silk. No shells for any of you shell-seekers. The water is clear. First week was windy and wavy, the second week was calmer. Both were fine, depending on what you like. You can walk forever, or so it seemed.As everyone says, the grounds are lovely and HUGE. We walked quite a bit (had to work off all the food and booze!) and never waited long when we decided to tram it. The staff are hard-working and very pleasant. Our favourites - Tomas in Bella Pasta (who also took care of us at our wedding), Ramon who sweats his you-know-what off ALL DAY in MacPrincess and our maids. Some speak English well, others poco. Take your dictionary and try. It's fun, you can always figure out a way to communicate and enjoy the beautiful language.Food was fine. We ate breakfast in El Gaucho a lot. Continental style, but we didn't have to a) get up early or b) go all the way to the lobby for a meal. Think we tried all the restaraunts at least once, except El Pescador. Everything was good. The standouts? Sakura was EXCELLENT (went during our second week when we were tired of buffets and wanted to taste something different). Licey was also great. My new husband had the lobster and said it was yummy, plus service was top-notch.Our wedding was like a dream. Beautfiul beach as the backdrop. Spanish musicians. Champagne. And then a private beach party with our own DJ, chef and waiter. I admit, I was on a high for two weeks so am probably not as critical as some. We did have a problem with water pressure. My advice? If you have a problem, tell them. They are quick to fix things. And during the second week, we saw a couple of cucarachas IN our room. Nothing a shoe and quick reflexes couldn't fix. Would recommend the Bavaro Splash trip if you're a snorkeller. We got our own little motor boat and followed the guide to a coral reef about 20 minutes away. Great view of the coastline and snorkelling was good. One of our group also went diving and said it was ok.We were in building 34. Right by the beach/restaraunts and the bus stop. (All the 30s seemed like good locations - email the hotel ahead of time). Room was nice and big. Really enjoyed our balcony with the view of the pool (and a little slice of ocean).Lots of comments on prior reviews re: rude Europeans. I think there can be a language barrier and perhaps cultural differences. (Think about it - Canadians say excuse me and I'm sorry about every ten minutes - in comparison, everyone seems a bit harsh) but whenever we talked to peple, they were very nice. Take LOTS of $1 bills (we had trouble getting large bills changed), tip when you feel it's appropriate (we did a lot, but don't think it changes the service), take a walk down the beach either way to the mini markets. VIP is good if you like the goodies (massage, horseback riding, Licey). Blah, blah, blah. I WILL stop. Go, have fun, try a Banana Mama and the Presidente beer, smile at people, merengue and soak up the wonderful culture.

<Content>Tropical Paradise We arrived on May 16th and were amazed by how beautiful the resort was. It may be large, but what a nice place to walk through. The BUS is always there if you don't want to walk.Check in was little disappointing. We received our key 2 hours after arriving at the hotel, while our friends received their keys right away. In the defense of the hotel, an election was being held that day and they were short staffed. When we got to our room 315 it had a very musty/mildew smell (ground floor). However, after a little bargaining we got another room the next day. Room 328 on the second floor - no musty smell and always clean with fresh flowers. For myself the food was excellent. My wife and friends were selective on what they ate, however, they always managed to find something to eat and it was usually good.Breakfast was always fantastic, lots of variety with made to order eggs, fresh fruit, fruit smoothies, sausage and bacon (a little different but good). However, the juice on the resort was always fruit drink not fruit juice (freshly squeezed organge juice would have been nice).Lunch was always good at Bella Past or Hispanola Restaurant. In the Evenings we only ate at three restaurants. Licey's - Fantastic, exceptional food and service. El Gaucho - Food and Service okay (they seemed to be understaffed that evening compared to the other restaurants. Hispanola - always a good variety and service great.One thing we noticed was that you would see the same staff early in the morning to late in the night. They work very long hours and everybody I mean everybody that we encountered tried their hardest to make you happy.The animation staff will try to keep you active. It was always fun to do the beach/water aerobics, table tennis, volleyball, water polo, etc..Loved the pool especially the swim up bar. Very friendly staff. Beach was beautiful but very windy some days.The nightly entertainment at the stage was nice. Get involved, you'll have more fun. Disco was good but started late evening (around midnight) too tired to enjoy it. Parasailing was great - would definitely recommend even it you have a weak stomach but try not to swallow any seawater. The massage was fantastic. Get one, you'll like it!!!Never got sick by eating and drinking as much as I wanted except for the evening I drank 2.5 bottles of wine. It was good!!!We enjoyed ourselves tremendously. Time seemed to stand still. I would recommend this resort. Keep an open mind and if you're not happy about something ask the staff they will do their best to fix it with a smile.

<Content>Heaven on earth!!! Just got back sunday may 16. I feel bad that I read all the negative reviews and lost my time doing so. After all, it's a 4.5 star, isn't it? I think people are dishonest because this place is HEAVEN ON EARTH!!! We lived the life of the rich and famous for one week. The people are so friendly. They smile all the time. One advise: You can get the VIP room near the beach with a supplement of 10$ per day. You don't need to buy the VIP plan. You can get your rhum bottles across the street for 6$ (the best brand) and you have access to 6 restaurants, plus a buffet on the beach two days per week. The food was great at all the restaurants. The flamingos and the peacocks (we saw 5 plus babies) eat right in your hands. The landcape is breathless. We had our 7 months old bay and the staff did every thing to accomodate us. They even brought a little bed without us asking for it. The fridge is always full of beer , water and sodas. Enough said, I wish I would have stayed another week.

<Content>Beautiful Bavaro Princess Just thought I would write my own review as we just returned on Friday April 30 and it was the most magnificent 7 days of my life, next to my wedding and the birth of my children of course. We booked thru a Canadian (Ft Erie) travel agent, we live in Buffalo, NY. Only my husband and I went- this trip was to celebrate our 7th wedding anniversary. Airport: We flew out of Toronto into Punta Cana International and let me tell you, the pictures we saw on the web do not do it justice. Hatch roof, open air, very tropical. After going thru customs, very easy if you have a passport and your tourist card already filled out. These cost $10US, hopefully whom every you book thru has them in your package already. You claim your luggage and head for the outside. There they have lots of men with signs showing several Travel groups, they tell you the number of your bus to your resort. Cross the parking lot, find your bus, check in with your travel guide, watch your luggage get put on, then take a seat. Our guide made a CERVESA(BEER) run to get cold, ice, cold El Presidente, the beer of chose in DR. Then its off to the resort. We did have to drop off people at 2 other resorts. They looked very nice, but none compared to what we were about to see.Check-In: the people-OH so very friendly. Check in went well, as well as any check-in can be. Told them our name, received cold tropical fruit drinks while in line. Had everything explained to us in English-pleasently surprised after all the negitive reviews about the language difficulties. Informed due to the time we arrived Noon our room would not be ready until 3pm, changed into our other cloths (swimsuits  shorts-packed in our carry on- thanks for the tip) we had lunch -Hisponola-buffet, they open @ 1pm. Then, because we opted for VIP,(very wise chose) we asked if we could get our key now, since we were heading for the beach and didn't want to have to come all the way back to the lobby in a couple of hours. The front desk guy was great-Hansel, he handed over the keys without even getting a tip- but we tipped him anyway. They make so little.Room: the pictures on line or even in the brochures do not do it justice. Beautiful, full stocked refrigerator, CERVESA,  cold soda  water, even diet soda! Fresh flowers, our maid even made the towels into ducks/swains and a heart on the bed. We did leave her little gifts after the first day, I got that as a tip from another website, but we also left a couple US dollars too. Next time I think I'll just leave US dollars, the gifts made our luggage extra heavy. They even had a cake delivered on the first day stating Feliz Annivesario. We thought that was a nice touch. *** Remember to pack the colored wash cloths-another tip we got***Beach: Beautiful, wonderful, magnificent, more than enough chairs  hunts for shade, even if you don't go out @ 8am to leave a towel on the chair-which to me seems lame, since the people who do this do not even show up to lay out and enjoy the beach until well into the afternoon.Pools: As pools go I guess they are good, but I didn't come all that way to sit by the pool. We lounge by it the first day, then it was the beach. But I do have to say the swim up bar is very cool.Food: never got sick, not even a little and my husband  I are lactose intolerant and we ate ice cream. We did as our Sunwing agent-Yessy said, stayed away from the coconut milk-natural laxative. So when I had a fresh fruit smoothy-pineapple every morning it was made with OJ instead of coconut milk and NO PINA COLADAS. But that was OK the food was great. El Gaucico- Steak house- good, not great, no steak sauce, so if your an A1 guy or gal bring your own MacPrincess- beach hunt, burger joint- great, chicken burgers, hamburgers, french fries-ketchup is different-kind of vinegary but OK if you only eat Heinz or Hunts or only like that kind of taste-bring your own Bella Pasta- just what the name implies-Italian, Great! pizza, pasta, steak, lasagna-great!  El Pescador- Seafood-had the very first night-wonderful, lobster does not taste like Maine lobster but good just the same. Sakura- Japenese theme-Asian flair- good but keep in mind your in DR not Japan-try the pisctascio ice cream-to die for. Chopin- great- buffet style, so something for everyone. Make sure you book for after around 8:30pm, thats when the piano boat signer sings 20 minutes-very nice.  Licey- gourmet-very, very nice. Atmosphere very romantic, had a bottle of Champange with dinner along with VINO, food was OK, glad it was included in the VIP, I don't think I would have been as happy if I had to pay the $25 per person charge. The Princess Lobster was different than what I was expecting but my husband had steak and he thought it was great! Hisponola- I think by far the best buffet I have ever been too. We went Thursday night, which is Dominican night. Shots of MAMA JUANA greet you at the door. Then the selection of food is amazing, all the delicacies of DR are on display including but not limited to the roasted pig-full body, of course.What can I say the food was great, I ate well every day. Breakfast was the main buffet-Hisponola-eggs made to order, fresh made fruit smoothies, waffles, doughnuts. Heard-Chopin also had breakfast but never made it there for breakfast. VIP: well worth the extra money, didn't do the horseback riding, but the Bottle of Rum-delicious, cigars, gourmet dinner and massage-WHICH WAS THE BEST ONE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED, was well worth it! PARASAILING: wonderful-and I'm afraid of heights-I don't even take my kids on the ferris wheel. But I did it 250- 300ft in the air, the company that took us out even dropped us off at the beach of our resort like a water taxi. Cost $75 for the two of us to go up together for about 15-20 minutes-GREAT! Shopping: Across the street or down the beach-BARGAIN, do not settle for the price they give you, move on if they do not give in, someone else will. PEOPLE: The Dominican people are the most friendly people I have every met. HOLA was all we ever heard from everyone we came across. The Europeans-Spanish, in particular are rude. They seemed to act as if not only was it the staffs every desire to fulfill all their wishes and commands but for all other guest to bow down to their feet also.All in all this was the greatest trip and best resort we have ever been to, but since this is the first resort we have been too, don't take my advise, check it out yourself!Mike  Monique Johnson, Buffalo, NY

<Content>great vacation My husband and I just returned from our vacation on May 2, 2004. We spent a week at this resort. It was heaven. I have read a lot of reviews and was alittle nervous, but everything was perfect. Our checkin went smoothly, the food and staff were great. The grounds and beach were out of this world. The worst thing about the trip was leaving. We would recommend this hotel to anyone and will return.

<Content>What a beautiful Environment! I went to the Bavarro from 4/25 - 4/30/04 and had a beautiful time! I can't believe the experiences that I see during this time period on the other reviews. From the minute we landed we had a very pleasant experience. When we checked in to the beautiful open-air main building, which doesn't need air conditioning in April because of the trade winds blowing through the area, we were greeted warmly by the Check-In clerk, given cute glasses of Punta Cana blue fruit punch! I walk with a cane and can't do steps very well, so the clerk, very happily gave us (2 women) a ground level room, and as it worked out it was in the VIP section, which is very close to the beach and swimming pool (within 2 minute walk). And we didn't buy a VIP plan! You can have a wonderful time without the VIP plan, if you aren't fussy and don't need your own robe and a horse ride. The suite they gave us was wonderful, clean and didn't have bugs or a mildewy smell. The cleaning staff were courteous and I felt that our belongings were very safe there. The food is adequate to good. My best experience was with the El Pescador (seafood) restaurant. Everything was extremely fresh and well-cooked. The buffets at Chopin and Hispanola need to be studied for a few minutes so you can see what is there (meats are grilled or fried , only) and then you make your selection. The best desert there is the catalin custard (flan), it's superb! For breakfast there is a short-order cook to make your eggs to order (very good), and a huge selection of other things to choose from. The beach is beautiful, and clean...I went early one morning to save my lounge chairs and the cleaning crew was there picking up the debris from the fierce evening trade winds. The pool is clean and inviting, too. They have many activities during the day to keep adults and children busy. The only drawback I see is that the evening entertainment is not very good, it's college-level talent, and most of it isn't really understood by Americans (either language or philosophy). But it was something to keep you occupied until 10 p.m., if you needed that.Overall, I'd suggest Bavarro as a 3-star resort for the price.

<Content>We just got back yesturday and we had a great time all week long We just got back yesturday and we had a great time. We had read alot of good and bad reviews, but you always need to keep in mind that you are going to another country and always keep a open mind when you get there. We got the VIP package and everything that they said we would get, we did. We had a great room in building 31 and it was close to everything except the lobby. Just take the tram bus and you will be fine. Yes the resort is large, but not so big you can't find your way. The food is different, but remember you are in another country. Don't expect gourmet, although the Licey was our favorite!! Everyone was friendly, we didn't get sick at all. I took Amodium with us and only used it once. Things to remember that helped us were to bring a washcloth for the shower (there were none), lots of sunscreen, men bring pants for all the resturants or they will not let you in at all, make your reservations as soon as you can to get all the times you want at the resturants you want, and bring dollar bills (ones) to tip every now and then- they seemed to appreciate it!! I stopped reading all the negative reviews when it got closer to our trip and I kept reading the positive telling myself that we would have a great time no matter what. And we did!! Also- you might bring a spanish dictionary to help you if you do not know spanish. My husband knew quite a bit, but they do primarily speek Spanish. We didn't have any problems. Go shop across the street for the best deals- you can get some good things a whole lot cheaper than in the resort. Go and have a great time- the eight days we went were awesome!! The VIP package was definitely worth the up grade!! We will definetly go back. Just relax and enjoy your vacation!!

<Content>Wonderful time! My boyfriend and I just got back last night from our vacation to Punta Cana. We were there from April 25-May 2. I have to admit, I was getting very scared to go there from some of the reviews that I have read. But the minute we got off that bus and saw how beautiful just the lobby was, I forgot about all the negative reviews. By the time we got there, our room was ready so we didn't have to wait, and our luggage was there within 20 minutes. The rooms are gorgeous and look exactly like the pictures. We didn't see any bugs in or around our room. We had a spider and some tiny ants here and there, but that was it. The entire resort is kept immaculate and you always see someone cleaning something. I was very impressed. The beach is absolutely the most gorgeous beach I have ever seen. Soft white sand, palm trees and crystal blue water (and it was warm)! It was amazing. Even the pool is gorgeous. As far as the food goes, we always found something we liked, and something we didn't like, that happens at home too. They are feeding hundreds of people all day long. I think they did a pretty good job of mixing up the menu everyday. Neither one of us got sick from the food. Just make sure you stick to bottled water too. Good luck getting a burger from MacPrincess near the beach. It seemed like only the people who spoke spanish were getting served and we kept getting igored. Licey's was the best restaurant we ate at. The steak was incredible. The nightly shows are nothing special, but were still entertaining. The bartenders were all very nice (especially when you tip them!) and make some great drinks. My top 3 choices: coco-loco, blue jay and a tropical princess. One of the only things that I can complain about is the language barrier. Try and learn some spanish if you plan on going there, because occassionally we did have a hard time getting what we wanted. But for the most part, they really do try. Shopping was interesting. I would recommend shopping across the street over the shops on the beach. They aren't as pushy over there. Be prepared to barter! One other complaint I have is when we were leaving. We rushed around to pack and check-out and get that all settled by 12pm, only to find out that our flight was delayed a couple of hours. Then delayed again. I would recommend checking your flight home in the morning, because we would have stayed on the beach, and not sat in the lobby for 3 hours. And they don't tell you anything either, you just have to keep checking, which was very annoying. We had the VIP package, which we thought was well worth it. We had a nice room, right near the beach and the main pool. We also got massages, went horseback riding on a beautiful beach, had dinner at Licey's and also were given a bottle of Rum (which was very good), and some cigars. All that is just for being VIP. We were also given better wines and higher class alcohol at the bars. The resort is very big, so if you don't like to walk, this isn't the resort for you. We didn't mind the walking, and they also have little trams that drive you all over the resort. All in all, we did have a wonderful time, and would definitely go back! Keep an open mind and don't let the little things get to you, and you will enjoy it there as much as we did.

<Content>Worst Caribbean Experience Ever! From the original visitor reviews I read on the web, to my vaccination nurse's comments on her husband's illness from the food, I had a bad feeling about this hotel/resort, but enthusiastically decided to believe the good ones. Big mistake! I travel everywhere, and this is the worst experience I have ever had. The food was unappetizing and immediately made both of us sick for the entire visit. We started to dread walking into the restaurants.The only thing we could eat was fresh fruit, some breads, cheese, shrimp in the shell and the pizza they made at noon. The service was full of contempt (the desk clerk laughed at me when we checked out!) and our paid guide or agent didn't bother to get us to the airport at the end of an expensive two week vacation. The constant harassment of the time-share hawkers, the indifference and contempt of the staff, including the concierge, the bad food, the high wind which made swimming impossible most of the time, made this the worst vacation experience of my husband's and my life! Not recommended. The DR needs to work on many things to be ready for any kind of tourism. We called this hotel the compound. Some fellow travellers agreed. The wife said as we were leaving at the airport: The only thing missing was Jim Jones!

<Content>True Paradise  This resort is paradise. The grounds, rooms and service are nothing less than exceptional. You will sometimes hear people complaining about things but they are only things you would really have to be searching for. The complaints are so minor, it's not worth listening to. The meals were good but maybe different from what you're use to. This is the Dominican culture not to blame the food on the resort. I enjoyed the food and especially enjoyed the people serving. One of the people working on the grounds would often take a coconut and chop off the top so we could drink fresh coconut milk almost daily. Add a little Dominican rum, a straw and the way you go. I give a five star rating as this is the fourth resort I鈥檝e been to, rating from 4  陆 to 5 stars, and by far the best. Go back? In a minute.

<Content>Great place to visit and plan to do so in the near future My husband and I decided to do something fun and different for our 25th anniversary and went to the Bavaro Princess. We both loved it a great deal and are planning on doing this as a yearly trip. The hotel was great--beautiful room. The beach and ocean are great--how anyone can say it isnt nice is beyond me. We stayed a week which isnt long enough. We went on the outback safari trip up into the mountains was great, especially boogy boarding. Our guide Raul Reddy was the best. I was a little afraid of going seeing all the negative reviews i had read but do not pay any attention to them because those people have no clue what they are talking about. If you want a fun, relaxing vacation this is the place to go. The weather was great--you could sit on the beach and watch the storms roll in fast and leave as fast as they came. I would very highly recommend this place to any one and have.

<Content>Disappointed and Upset My two friends and I were looking forward to a wonderful, relaxing vacation. Unfortunately, this vacation became a horror right at the point of check-in. It started with the clerk promising us a better room if we were willing to take care of him. We each paid an extra $20 dollars. He also asked if we smoked and, of course, he wasn't talking about cigarettes at which point we declined. Our room had a strong stench of mildew/mold but if that wasn't bad enough, we were three women in a room that had two twin sized beds and an infestation of roaches. We are not talking about one, but more like we were not able to move anything without one scurrying about. According to the maid the room had at some point flooded and after airing it out and realizing that the humidity attracted a large number of insects, they decided to exterminate the room. That was the upgrade we received. When we complained to the clerk at the front desk, he seemed more concerned on providing us with pot than he was about our comfort. To make matters worse, we arranged for a tour of the city the following morning and contacted the front desk the night before about having us picked up at 6:15am via trolley to the main bldg. Wherein we would meet the tour bus for departure at 7AM. Unfortunately, we missed the tour because we were never picked up (after calling 4 times). It appears that the staff do not start their shift until 7am. You would figure upon calling the front desk numerous times, someone at the front desk would inform us. It took 1-1/2 days and a lot of talking to get our rooms changed to acceptable status and even longer to get them to listen to the reason of why we missed the tour. The natives themselves are very humble but there are those like Christian, the front desk check-in clerk, who can smell a tourist and try to take advantage. The food is pretty bad. Their idea of meat is lunch meats in addition to everything being fried - to the point of oily. The drinks were good and the bartenders (Secundido and Francisco) were great. The beach is BEAUTIFUL (crystal clear and blue). Personally, it wasn't worth it. I regret putting my money into this vacation. If you want a beautiful beach then go there, if you want more than that, please go elsewhere and thank me later.

<Content>Okay but not great. My family and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from April 17, until April 24. There was little to complain about, and nothing to be impressed with either. The place was beautiful, and the beach was gorgeous, but other than that, everything else was average. We had a good time thanks to the other guests we met, and no one got sick from the food, but other than that there is nothing good or bad to say. The VIP upgrade was a good deal simply because we never had to wait in line for restaurant reservations, and had rooms right next to the pool and the beach. The Kids Club had very limited hours and the kids were bored after one day. The service was okay but not great, and the rooms could use a good cleaning. I'm glad we went, but for the price, we could have done better at the Iberostar Bavaro. I will not visit again.

<Content>Overall, a more or less decent place Recently spent 4 days at Bavaro Princess. The greates drawback of the place lies in its size. The territory is huge. It takes the trolley approximately 7-10 minutes to travel between the most distant points such as the reception area and the beach. One can purchase a regular stay, VIP or Super VIP. The main attraction in the VIP option is that with one will be situated closer to the beach. Super VIP brings you oceanview. This is what we had, and location-wise it was superb - you see the ocean thorugh the front door, and it takes less than a minute to walk to the beach. Other VIP attractions include inclusion of greater variety of drinks, one dinner at the gourmet restaurant, free massage and a free horse ride. There are many different restaurants on the property, the gourmet does stand out. Otherwise, the food is plentiful, clean, but can be characterzied as nothing good nothing bad. All restaurants which I would rather call themed eateries - as they have an Italian, and Argentinian, and Asian, etc., except for the gourmet, are not air-conditioned which was still OK in April, but I can only imagine how hot it will be in July. The gormet restaurant is very classy, with different items appearing on the menu. I have not been to the fish and Asian restaurants, so my review does not encompass those. There are no waiters on the beach, nor are there any showers. To get those, one has to go to the pool area which is not far away, yet it is an inconvenience. The check-in area is attractive, but again not air-conditioned. The rooms are, and they are OK. The beach itself is great, with the sand having a buttery feeling to it especially when one is in the water. The beach can get crowded, so it is a good adea to arrive early so to be able to reserve a spot.

<Content>Great value! We were part of a convention group (nearly 200 persons). We were treated royally. Super fast check-in and welcome drinks. The baggage delivery system was slow, I arrived at 6 PM and my baggage were not in my suite until 8 PM.Since we know Spanish we had no problems communicating with all personnel. The maids, waiters, concierge, servers, etc., were very friendly and accommodating. We tipped frequently, considering most of them only have minimum wages.The telephone was not working when we arrived, it was fixed by the second day. The TV was not working either but we were happy anyway,,,we were not there to watch TV. Food quality was usually excellent. We enjoyed the local beer (Presidente). The show was quite entertaining, but not spectacular. Dance music was great.Overall, we give very high marks to the hotel.

<Content>Loved It!!!! My boyfriend and I went to Punta Cana for Valentine's day for one week and it was absolutely amazing!!!! We are both in our mid 20's and found the hotel to be very accomodating to all ages. At the time that we went the weather was phenomenal. Sunny-85 degrees and only rained once for about five minutes. On Valentine's day they decorated our room with flowers and all the restaurants were decorated also. They really out-do themselves.The food was excellent, except for the cheese was a little warm. There was six different restaurants all specializing in different meals (ie: Gaucho-steak, La Bella Pasta-Italian, El Pescadore-fish, Licey-a la carte, an asian restaurant-I can't remember the name, and even the buffet dinners were fantastic. I highly reccommend the chopin for breakfast. I also reccomend going VIP because of the perks. There were a lot of people at the bar that could not get top shelf drinks because they had to pay extra for them. Also a free massage, horseback riding, Licey dinner, robes, run, cigars. I would definitely bring pants and a light jacket because it does get a little chilly at night, especially when you are sun burnt. I have been to several islands to include St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. Martin, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Cancun, Cabo San Lucas (which I also reccommend staying there at the Royal Solaris), and now here and this was by far the best vacation yet. I give it six stars and top notch. Do not miss this experience!!!!!

<Content>Loved it! You have to be open-minded! I have traveled to quite a few places and this place was the most beautiful. The food was terrific, service was awesome. The excursions were great. I had such a great time!!! The hotel is impeccable and that is a understatement. I kind of wished that we were the only two there from the states. Of course English is not the first language and was shocked of how rude people from the states were. I think people did not realize that they are in a different country. If you do not speak the language learn a little or buy a book that helps you while you are traveling - that is a true traveler. My spanish is not as good as it used to be, but the folks were so kind and helped me out with business I needed to take care of back home in the states, faxed paperwork over for me, mailings and contacted me if I had messages or delivered them to my room. The shops were great, people were not pushy. The saddess part was leaving. Although, there are so many places to travel and I do not like to travel to the same place twice, but this one I have to go to again. Thank you Bavaro Princess and Staff!!!

<Content>Better than we expected My husband and I spent one week at Bavaro Princess Feb 6, 2004 and had an excellent time. Before going I had read many negative comments on this site and was worried. We were attending a family wedding and had no choice in the hotel!We were pleasantly surprised by all the hotel had to offer. It is really a tropical paradise and is immaculate. The one thing we found which exceeded our expectations was the staff. Even if their English was sometimes limited we were treated like royalty. We had a few favorites whom we talked to and joked with every day. These people make about 20-30$ US a wk, so be generous! A couple bucks doesn't make much difference when you are paying over 1700 a wk to stay there, but it sure makes a difference for them.The beach is beautiful and the pool was super clean the whole time we were there. The only negative thing I can say about this resort is that the rooms are extremely musty. Yes, it is a humid country but I have stayed at other hotels in the Caribbean and this was definitely the most extreme case. We tried putting the A/C on max but nothing worked. My husband said he got used to the smell, but I never did.Food-we really enjoyed Sakura asian restaurant and went twice. Chopin has a great buffet selection. My family loved El Gaucho the best. The only negative thing is that the grease content is high in all restaurants. I often found I was stuck with an after-taste of oil. Bring lots of gum and candies! Its extremely expensive in the gift shop.I could go on and on about our week there. It was such a relaxing vacation. No glitches. Customer service was great. We had no hot water the first day and called to ask if they could check it. They came within the hour and fixed it.One thing to note is that if you don't like walking this may not be the resort for you. It is huge!! The lobby is about a 15-20 min walk from the beach. We were lucky as they gave us a room 3 min from the beach. The rest of the wedding guests booked the jr suites which are near the lobby. Yes, they are a little cheaper but they are far from the beach and the rooms are older. Also, being near the entrance it is nosier, lots of traffic. There is a tram to bring you around the resort, which is helpful. if you want to get off between stops just let the driver know. No problem.The wedding went off without a hitch. My husband and I got married at Barcelo Maya resort in Mayan Riviera 2 yrs ago. Both weddings were similar-very romantic. The only thing I liked better about Barcelo Maya was that it was a newer resort. But I will defintely recommend Bavaro Princess. Enjoy!!

<Content>Paradise if you pay attention to the positive! I have to confess that I almost allowed some of the reviews posted here to ruin my vacations. Even though more positive reviews were being posted lately, the negative ones were far too strong. I spent the week of March 27 to April 03. For the first two days I was very aprehensive just waiting for something horrible to happen. Well, I finally relaxed and enjoyed myself. Nothing HORRIBLE happened. Yes, there were a few incidents, but some people let little things ruin their vacations. If you keep an open mind you will have a GREAT time! I did not see ANY BUGS AT ALL, except for a few flies. No mosquitoes, spiders, etc. There was also no need for remote control and beach towels. These items were available all the time. I also had read that they had the same food over and over. They have to have it! They have EVERYTHING (from extremelly fresh seafood to grilled meats, pasta, vegetables. etc.); therefore, it is impossible not to have the same food! I agree that some restaurants served better than others, but overall the service was THE BEST! I have never seen so many hard workers together in one place. You will not see an angry face. You will see all of them smiling all the time. $1 and $2 tip are very welcome, and it is true - they do recognize you and give you extra attention even though you do no need it. About guests being rude... yes they were. The worst was that they did not respect the order of arrival for the transportation. However, not only Europeans were rude. I was horrified by a family from Ohio screaming at the driver in two different occasions for him to stop the tram. It was much easier to just tell the driver to PLEASE stop at room #???. There were some very FUNNY shows where guests got to participate. We never had a chance to get bored. They also have a Dominican night on Thursdays. Overall, we had a GREAT experience and we are already plannig to go back for Christmas. The hotel is so relaxing that we lost track of days. Just WONDERFUL if you keep count of the positive's and not negative's!!!

<Content>Save your money and go to Hawaii! I just got back from staying at the Bavaro Princess from April 3-10. The beach and the grounds were really really nice but here were my problems. All the food was really poorly made. We ate at almost every restaurant and every day I was left feeling sick. By the middle of the week I was disgusted with the food and with an all inclusive you should really be able to enjoy it. Also, there were tons of flies and bugs all over the food. Our room was okay looking but the floors were permanently damp and grungy I guess from the weather but they really need to do something about that. If you go I suggest you bring some extra money to get laundry done because my clothes started to smell from the hotel room. The smell travelled with me to my house, when I opened my suitcase my whole family complained that it stank (I washed my clothes twice and it wouldn't go away). I am a very clean person so this fact really disturbed me. The language barrier is also really really bad. There wasnt one person who could speak understandable english, or understand what we were saying. There were many misunderstandings especially when our room was not ready for 2 hours after check in and when our wake up call never came. Also most of the people in that country are out to rip you off. Especially the 2 stores in the resort, $20 american for a little candle is what the lady wanted. To get anything at a descent price we had to travel into the market and do a lot of bargaining. Although there were many nice and honest bartenders and geat maids there were so many times when I would ask how many american dollars were so many pesos and they would make up a lot more than that was worth. To sum it all up the beach and the grounds were beautiful but everything else was average or poor.

<Content>Don't do it! My husband and I are easy going people, we read the reviews about the Bavaro Princess (particularly the bad ones) and decided we would give it a try despite some of the bad reviews (we can make the best out of anything and that's what we did). Some reviews have blamed bad service due to the language barrier (this hotel does not cater to the American tourist), but that was not the case with us because my husband speaks fluent Spanish, English Portuguese and Italian. The bad service is due to the laziness of the staff. Many staff members will make up an answer if they don't know it, just to get you out of their face (we almost missed our plane home because of this). We went VIP and were told that since we were VIP we wouldn't have to make reservations to the restauraunts (except Licet's the nicest one), however, that is not true. We didn't have to wait in long lines to make our reservations though we delt with a VIP consierge, who was rude, unhelpful and pulled a nasty trick on us. He promised us reservations our first night at Licey's and told us he would have them for us and we could pick up our ticket between 1:00-3:00. We went back to pick up our reservations and the consierge had left a sign stating the hours they were closed:between 12:00-5:00 and another sign that said no dinner reservations would be taken after that. We were so upset by the trick he pulled. We ran into him again later and asked him about our reservations. He acted like we had no idea what we were talking about. Checking in the hotel was also mass confusion. No one told you where to go, what to do and so people were standing around trying to figure out how to get to get to their rooms and so forth. We kept asking (remember we speak fluent Spanish) but no one wanted to help. So we walked around aimlessly for a while (this 100 acre resort) until we found a tram that took us around and around. We eventually got off where the room numbers were getting in the 400's (we stayed at 443) and found our room. During our stay, beaches were nice, nightly entertainment was good and bartenders were busy. We enjoyed outr time on the beach until we had to deal with the nightmare of checking out. Checking out- no one told us anything about where and when to get our bus back to the airport , so again we walked around asking questions. One bell hop pointed to our plane ticket and told us we would catch our bus to the airport at 1:30 (he was looking at our arrival time to Punta Cana, so he obviously was confused) . We finally found a man at the information desk who was helpful. He told us our bus would be loading at 11:50 (it was almoct 11:50 then), so he asked a bell-hop if the bus had arrived yet and the bell-hop said no, so we waited for an hour. It turned out that our bus was THERE and loading when we had originally asked, but now it was gone. So, then we had to pay for a taxi to get to the airport. I was so furious. Because of the laziness and quick thinking answes of the staff, we missed our bus and almost our plane. Please don't go to this hotel, unless you are looking for a stressful week in Punta Cana.

<Content>Tropical Paradise for the open minded! I spent the week of Feb. 6-13, 2004 at the Bavaro Princess, Punta Cana. I won't bother telling you all the details about the resort because I think most other people already have. I will just tell you things I wish I had known before I went. These aren't necessarily good or bad things, just things that would have lessened the surprise aspect of my vacation. When we arrived at the airport the rush you through VERY quickly, and you have to pay 10$ to enter the country, so make sure you bring cash! Then you are off on a bus to the resort, and be prepared for some very anxiety provoking traffic situations. There are tons of mopeds and vehicles passing on the right, and there are no traffic lights or stop signs at intersections so it can be a bit chaotic. But remember---these people do this EVERY day, so don't be alarmed. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. The grounds crew is up at the crack of dawn EVERY morning cleaning the grounds. The weather is perfect. The beach is the BEST beach in Punta Cana, in fact we saw people from other resorts on our beach because it is the best. Our first night at 5:00AM and found a gigantic cock roach. This made me a little scared to sleep again, but we never saw another one after the hotel people came and sprayed the room. That was a little unsettling. The food isn't bad, just not something I liked the taste of, so I wish I had brought more food from home. Definitely get the VIP package....well worth the $. Our room was literally 15 Ft. from the beach, and I would go out every night at dusk and stroll the beach and sometimes just sit and think, and I NEVER SAW ANYONE. I don't know of too many places in the world where you can sit all by yourself in a tropical paradise as though you were in your back yard. The whole trip was worth that time I spent at night on the beach. DO NOT make international calls, no matter how cheap they tell you it will be!!!!!! IT IS NOT CHEAP!!!!!!!!! VERY EXPENSIVE!!!!! DO NOT use your credit card. The exchange rate changes so quickly that by the time the transaction makes it to the US you will be charged a totally different amount. That is great if it turns out in your favor, but you may end up spending A LOT more than you planned on!!!! The airport is has a thatched roof, and you have to pay 20$ to leave the country, so make sure you don't spend all your cash!!! Remember English isn't spoken by many people, so try to be patient. There are MANY europeans-----few americans. Just keep an open mind, and if you are a person who can't deal with change, and have a very specific list of needs on your vacation, this probably isn't the place for you. But if you just want a tropical paradise where you can COMPLETELY get away from anything Americanized---including the people, and a place to completely relax and not have to worry about a thing other than what day of the week it is----than Bavaro Princess is the place for you!!!

<Content>The Bavaro Princess is Great In a word Fabulous! The rooms and grounds were well cared for. The beach was wonderful and relaxing. I loved all the huts; I sunburn easily. A fantastic Animation staff, and can they dance! Everyone was friendly, attentive and very accomodating. The food was very good. We especially liked El Gaucho and La Bella Pasta Restaurants. The wait staffs throughout the hotel were very friendly and attentive.I would suggest more Ala Carte restaurants. One buffet restaurant is enough. Although we really liked La Hispanola, the breakfasts were incredible.We will be returning in the future and plan on staying at the Bavaro Princess.

<Content>Wonderful Time! I recently returned from my trip. I was at the Bavaro Princess from March 23rd to March 30, 2004. I as others was a bit nervous about the resort after the negative reviews. Ignore the bad and experience it for yourself! Check In: The check in was fine. We were given a welcome drink as soon as we got to the counter. We were all done within 10 minutes. They gave us tags to put on our luggage and the bags were delivered to our rooms within 15 minutes. There was a misunderstanding about the number of people staying in my room but it was corrected and a bed was brought to my room within 15 minutes. The room was really nice. We stayed in building 28 room #274. I had worried about the comments that were made about the Jr Suites. All of the rooms that they book are Jr Suites. The only difference is whether or not they are VIP. I can only assume that they had overbooked during the times people were put into the two storybuilding in the front of the resort. That area is the area they use for courtesy rooms. We did book as VIP. It was well worth it. People who didn't were very frustrated with trying to make reservations for dinner everyday and often couldn't. The massage on the beach was wonderful and the cigars and rum were nice too. We never did get the robes but we didn't mind. The only part of the VIP I didn't care for was the horseback riding. I love riding and had looked forward to it but it was awful. You ride through the woods in an area that resembles a garbage dump. There is nothing scenic about it. I had hoped it would be on the beach. It is also sad to see how the animals are mistreated. Don't bother with this and take in some more sun instead. The Food: I consider myself very picky when it comes to food. I don't care for seafood and often don't like to try new things. The buffet at Hispanola was incredible every time. The steaks at Bella Pasta and ElGaucho were the best steaks I have ever had. Very good! We often got snacks at Mac Princess. The chicken sandwiches and fries were always good. We really enjoyed lunch at Bella Pasta. As part of the VIP, we had the free diner at Licey. I don't care for gourmet food but I had a steak there that was so good. The service there was also great. Actually the service in all of the places was wonderful, even the buffets. I can't imagine complaining about the food. I always found many things I liked and even gained a few pounds on the trip. The desserts were always good. Nightlife: Each night the large group of people we were with met in the main lobby at the bar. The bartenders were great. They were a lot of fun and always remembered the drinks you liked. Often they had drinks waiting for us before you could even finish one. The shows in the lobby were nothing that we were interested in but each night we went to the disco and that was always a good time. Suggestions: Some things I had read were helpful like bringing washcloths. I also found that you do want to avoid the area near the waste treatment plant (19-22). Other things were not necessary. I did bring gifts for the maid. This is not something I recommend. We did not get any better service on the days that I left them. Actually on days I didn't leave anything I came back to fresh flowers everywhere. Save the room in your suitcase for something else. Also, rarely did we tip. Afterall, it was an all inclusive trip and we had paid quite a bit of money for this stay. Sometimes we did leave a dollar or two for the bartenders and we did tip at Licey. The service was always great without leaving extra money. As others said, shopping can be frustrating. Be prepared to for them to refuse any offer you make. Stand your ground though. If you walk out of the store, they will chase after you and agree to your price........and if they don't, you can find the same thing in another store. In a friends room there was a musty odor and she called the front desk. They quickly corrected the problem by using a scented air filter. All I can say is that they are very eager to please and if you have any problems, just call the front desk. We found a coconut in our front lawn there and one of the grounds keepers cut it open for us. It was amazing how quickly he could do it. The coconut was wonderful. Other entertainment: 2 of us did go to Manati Park to swim with the dolphins. It was $70 US per person and well worth it. It was a great experience. The park was so so but that was not what we went there for. Although we did have fun holding a spider monkey there. Also a group of us went parasailing. We set it up right through the water shack at the resort. It was $85 for two and once again, well worth it. This was probably my favorite part of the trip. I could go on and on about this trip but to sum it up, it was incredible.

<Content>great stay Just got back from the DR, had a great time with lots of rest, hotel was exactly as it was in the book. Rooms very spacious and very clean. Food was good, with lots of choices. Even the most picky would find plenty to eat. The steak house was one of our favorite places to eat. People were friendly and helpful, the language barrier was hard some times at the hotel but the maids and waitress tried their hardest to understand. At the plaza and the beach shops they spoke very good english most of the time. We went on a outback safari and this was wonderful learned alot of history of the DR and seen the true country side. Every where you went they always had lots of rum and beer for you to drink. One of our favorite drinks was the Bluejay, this tasted like the 3 flavored posicles. I would definitly recommend this resort to anyone going to Punta Cana.

<Content>Beautiful Bavaro We just arrived back from a beautiful week in the Dominican March 20th. The bus ride to the hotel from the airport was 35 minutes. Check-in went well. The rooms are beautiful and spacious. The beach is absolutely gorgeous. It takes a day to get familiar with the layout of the resort and the bus schedule. We missed breakfast 4 days out of the week because they close at 10AM in the main buffet. Do yourself a favor and wake up a little earlier becuase the beach shack has nasty food. We strongly suggest that you spend a little extra money and sign up for the VIP. This was the best decision we could have made- no lines for dinner reservations, top shelf liquor, free massage and horeseback ride (which was the most fun) and a free dinner at the most romantic place to eat...LICEY. As for the other restaurants, Chopin was horrible for dinner as it was full of bugs and flies. The main buffet is better than some of the restaurants that you need a reservation for. If you like casinos, a bus will pick you up after 7 everyday and bring you to the next resort. The grounds are well kept as well as the rooms. The hospitality of the workers was tremenous and a little tip goes a long way. The hotel has a flea market once a week, buy your souvenirs there. Or, if you are willing to bargain, there are vendors on the beach -- a 25 minute walk in either direction. Overall, a very nice and relaxing vacation spent in beautiful Punta Cana.

<Content>Everything but the weather  Went from 3-25-04 to3-31-04. Our accomodations and treatment by the resort staff was excellent. The resort and our room was beautiful and spacious. Overall the food was very good. Dinner at Bella Pasta was terrible, as was the beachside burger joint McPrincess skip these 2 and you'll be all right. Licee, Pescadora, and Goucho were excellent for dinner. We gave the restaurant and bar staff $1-$2 whenever the service was good, and by the 3rd day they would recognize you immediately and give you extra special treatment each time. The Europeans were very rude as previously reported and frequently would cut in front of you while in line for the bar, tram, or any other line you were waiting in. Plus they STINK!!! Other guests couldn't have been nicer. We only got 3 days of sun with the others being mostly cloudy with only small breaks of sun. We got the V.I.P. package for $15.00 per person per day, and only took it from our 2nd day until our 6th. The only benefit for the 1st  last day would be top-shelf liquor. Beach  pool were beautiful (reserve your space by 8:00 or take what's left.) If you're going to go shopping you can walk approx. 1.5-2 miles in either direction on the beach and do it there. It's cheaper than in the town area across the street from the resorts. The stores to the right were in a small town, and the sales people were much pushier. Don't let them intimidate you, be firm and they'll leave you alone. All in all it was a great resort with only minor problems which for us was mainly the poor weather, but we would probably not go back to the D.R. as we liked Jamaica much better.

<Content>don't be scared off by bad reviews The hotel and the staff went out of their ways to make sure we had everything we needed. The food os a little suspect but definatly above average. The pool was empty every day and never had to wait for a drink. We have been to numerous resorts and this is just as nice as Aruba, Costa Rica, and Mexico . The only problem is the rude French people, just drink more booze you won't even be able to tell after a while...

<Content>Beyond Expectations!!! My husband and I just returned from our honeymoon at Bavaro Princess, 20-27 Mar 2004. All I can say is I don't know where the negative reviews come from. This place exceeded our expectations. We read the review, just like you are and started to wonder if we had made the right choice. But from the time we arrived at the resort to the time we left, we were completely happy with our decision to go to the BP. The room, the resort, the beach, the grounds, everything was just as we read in the travel brouchure.We arrived at the resort around 1130AM and checked in. Our room wasn't going to be ready until 3PM so we changed into our swim suits and headed for the lobby pool to cool off. By the time we had a few drinks and lunch our room was ready and we were on our way to a perfect holiday. Each day we ate breakfast at Chopin and lunch at Bella Pasta. We found these to be the best places to eat. You can find something to eat at all the restaurants. With VIP you get a dinner at Licey's. This was by far the best meal with the best setting we had on our trip. If you don't have the VIP I would suggest spending the extra $25 US to go - it's well worth it.I can't say enough about the staff. This is the happiest group of people I've ever seen and they really work hard to keep guests happy. A few words of Spanish are always appreciated. We also brought trinkets from Canada to give away and always left housekeeping a few dollars each morning. This gesture guaranteed you extras in your mini-bar and fresh flowers each day.If you are a VIP guest, I highly recommend that you go for the free 30 min massage. This was one of the highlights of our trip. Saving a chair by the pool each day was an easy thing to do. You can even leave your bag, etc unattended and not have to worry about it being taken while you're swimming. At the beach we found it a bit more difficult. One morning we selected chairs by placing our towels on them, just like everyone else does. When we came back to claim our seats, our chairs had been dragged away by another couple and they even took our towels. If you're going to the beach be prepared to stay or lose out.The mini trains make it easy to make your way through the resort and they run often. Be warned, this isn't a handicap accessible resort. There are many areas that a person in a wheelchair would have a difficult time getting in to, like the lobby for starters.You'll also find that there are no facecloths on this resort. Be sure to bring your own. You'll also not find a clock in your room. There is a small, two-cup coffee maker in each room. We brought packages of Tim Horton's coffee to have each morning. The coffee in the Dominican is a bit stronger than our coffee and takes a bit to get use to.We read the reviews and brough lots of immodium with us, but luckily never had to use it. Just watch what you put in your mouth. You should never drink the tap water or even use it for brushing your teeth - stick to the bottle water, there's plenty.My husband and I were sad to leave and look forward to a future time when we can return to this paridise. Don't have any reservations - just go, relax and have a great holiday.

<Content>Totally magnificent ! ! ! Arrived March 13 and departed (sadly) March 20. From the moment we arrived we knew we were in a special place. My wife, my two daughters ( 6 and 9) and I were thrilled to be in such a wonderful setting. Just the lobby and front fishpond / courtyard area alone were breathtaking. Check in was no problem. Most of the front desk people speak adequate english to be helpful. Our room was ready shortly after we checked in. ( You have to remember that a lot of people are checking out that morning and patience with the staff in regards to getting your room ready will be well rewarded.) When we got to our room ( 344 ) in bungalo 34 it simply could not have been better. A call ahead of time to Remmy and a brave try at Spainsh seemed to do the trick as far as getting a great bungalo. Two single cots were set up for the girls and the king size bed for us was great. The suites are spacious, clean, and well maintained. The only minor problem was the shower, which only trickled water. One phone call the next morning and it was fixed before we went to sleep that night. Overall the grounds were immaculate. The resort is very spacious - ok it is huge ! But not overwhelming. The little 'busses' that drive you from one end to the other ran constantly and were very adequate. The staff were ALL very friendly, helpful, and hard-working to make our stay pleasurable. The food was simply great. The buffet was super morning, noon and night and reserving spots in the other resturants throughout the week was not a problem if you were in line between 8 and 9 a.m. The last night we went to Goucho which ended up being the best. Bella Pasta and Choppin were the other two we tried. I would have liked to go to Pescador however the ladies are not into seafood - oh well ! We experienced NO problem with the food. All was well prepared, and plentiful. I reccomend eating around the pool for lunch. Just go to the snack shack for burgers, dogs, chicken burgers etc. Or, my favorite Bella Pasta for pizzas ! If you catch them making the pizza around 11:30 or so a.m., they may even put one together for you - I liked pineapple and mushroom and got exactly what I ordered. I am an early morning walker so was up and took our towels and sand toys to reserve our spot by the pool every morning. Everyone does it and the reserved spots are honored by all. We had a choice spot right across from the island waterfall. Close to the swim-up bar too ! Sandy and Ruberto were great at the swim up bar. You treat them kindly and show a little respect toward their hard work and character with a few $1's and they reward you! The girls simply had a wonderful week making friends and enjoying the Mini-Show nightly after supper. They did get involved in a few activities however were in the pool most of the week. I made the effort to buy a Spanish dictionary and try to learn a few plesentries and sayings, and the staff appreciate it. This was our first family trip to a Caribbean spot. We were very pleased. This is a great family resort and we would return on our next visit to Punta Cana.

<Content>Loved the Bavaro Princess My wife and I,along with our best friends,(on thier honeymoon) have been back from the Princess for one day after 2 weeks at this fabulas hotel. I have been to many many holiday(15) resorts the past 10 years and the Bavaro by far and away had the best food ever. I cannot understand ANYBODY complaining about the food or abundance of seafood. Our Shelley does not do seafood whatsoever but lots and lots other meals available. The beach rates very highly, comparible to the best Cuba has to offer. I, personally am a shorts and shirt guy but still did the gourment restaurants. Some good, some for me not so. We had the Super VIP, but at the least I recomend the regular VIP. Well worth the extra charge. Drinks are abundant.Rooms are actually very large compared to some. This is for sure a 4+ hotel. A small tip is in order for extra special service. We would and will return in a heart beat. The grounds are huge as others have stated but beautifilly manicured. Any questions feel free to e-mail me but I am gone to Cuba from March 29- April 5 if you can wait. As for the showers,yes, pressure is somewhat low but cmon travellers your in a developing country that digs trenches with a pick and shovel by a local worker that makes $20.00 a day if he worls hard.

<Content>Not the Best, but... This was not our first time in Punta Cana. The beach is always fantastic. This resort, however, is not a 4.5 star. The huts were abundant, but you have to take the time to look. The rooms were indeed clean but the shower had no pressure and had lukewarm water. On our 6th day we found out the best time to take a shower is 4 p.m. Kids Club okay, we have an 8 year old son. The main bathroom at the beach flooded four times when we were there - had to walk around the mess. The pool was okay. Bella Pasta restaurant was being repaired (the roof) and a few times the tarp flew up -- made us wonder what would happen next. Food was okay, as the other reviews say lots of oil, but we enjoyed it. The fruit is amazing. The staff were as friendly as busy staff can be. This resort was a bit big for us. We've been to Punta Cana three other times and won't return to this resort again as we know the better ones. The grounds are beautiful - be prepared to walk - we did - or take the golf cart like buses. Lots of Europeans. Language not a big problem, you have to expect that their first language isn't English so brush up on the necessary words. We did parasailing - nice. Also the catamaran day tour - long day - 13 hours. Our son found the day long. It's more for adults as there wasn't any children there. All in all Punta Cana is always beautiful, but look for a smaller resort if you want the true hospitality of the people and their warmth. Smaller resorts remember you which makes you feel more welcome.

<Content>Paradise  My friends and I just got back from our one week stay at the Hotel Bavaro Princess. We are already planning our next trip back in a few months. We all cried when we left and we miss it so much. Before I went I read a bunch of reviews from a bunch of different sites and my picture of paradise soon went out the window. I figured we would be worse off because we were a bunch of teens, but the picture of paradise was restored once we arrived...and it will remain a picture of paradise forever. Check in was a breeze even though we didn't speak a word of spanish when we arrived. We talked slowly, got our rooms, and jumped on the trolley to our rooms. After a quick scan of the immaculate room, our luggage arrived and we got ready for our first night of partying. We didn't pay attention to the fact that we had to reserve dinner at all the restaurants except the Hispaniola so we ended up having breakfast and dinner at the Hispaniola (buffet) the first day. We made reservations for the Chopin (buffet) the next night. The Chopin turned out to much better than the Hispaniola. We then tried the Bella Pasta (Italian, order), which was a bit of a disappointment, however the pizza was very good, and the Gaucho (steakhouse, order) which was very good, but we didnt like the fact of waiting for them to cook before we ate. The Argentinian Barbeque steak was very good. On the second day we found out that the Chopin also served breakfast, which was excellent because it was closer to our rooms and we enjoyed everything about it more than the Hispaniola. I am the most picky eater anyone has ever met, and i never starved, i always found a lot of things i knew i couldn't get sick from and i would enjoy. We made friends with various bartenders at all the bars (helped along by tipping) and we always received a large smile, received all the drinks we wanted and extra drinks even when we didn't order them, and got served before others who were waiting longer. Even with the language barrier, we never had a problem ordering anything. One of the most enjoyable parts of our trip was the shows at night. Seeing as their was 9 of us (ended up being 17 of us) we were well known (probably as the crazy canuck kids) and we joked aroung with the Animation team (the entertainers) and soon developed a great friendship with all of them. The shows were hilarious and the team never let us miss out on all the events they run through out the day. It's these guys that we miss the most. The garden crew and the cleaning ladies kept everything looking spectacular. We never had a problem with the cleaning ladies. There were three of us in each room, and we started with only 2 towels in the bathroom, but a polite phone call to the desk got an extra towel delivered to the room. A note (written with the little spanish we picked up) and a tip got us extra towels (toallas) for the rest of our stay. The fridge was always stocked, the windows and floors cleaned, beds made... everything. All the facilites and the beach were incredible. I have never seen anything so gorgeous and well kept. Undescribable. We (all 9 plus the eight friends we met staying at the resort) went on a day trip. We went on a party and snorkeling trip on the Kon Tiki. The crew were hilarious and the snorkeling was excellent. Definetly recommened if you want to party. The nonpowered watersports were included and we took full advantage of it. Boggieboarding, windsurfing and kayaking were our choices and we did at least one each day. Hobie cats were also available. Very enjoyable. The only thing I can think of that is close to negative is the size of the resort. At 96 acres a walk from one end to the other is quite a hike, but the friendly trolley drivers make going anywhere on the resort as easy as pie. I don't suggest buying anything from the shops in the resort, a very nice 20 minute walk left or right on the beach lands you in the arms many willing vendors to give you the best deal, and anything you want almost free. My friends and I always bartered them to at least 25% of what they originally asked, and we found walking away always ended up with them calling us back to their shop to give us our souvenirs at the price we wanted to pay. If you are trying to decide on a resort or you are already booked here, this is the best resort in Punta Cana by far. We saw every resort and ours was superior in every way. My friend from school was in the resort next to us, The Flamenco, which was also suppose to be good, but she even admitted that ours was by far superior. There disco (club) was more exciting but it worried me that they let people from the village (who appeared to be prostitutes) into the club. We always had fun at our disco, especially when our friends from the Animation crew showed up. I hope this has helped you out, and maybe I will see you there:) And if you have any questions feel free to email me and ask away.KEY WORDS TO KNOW agua - water (which is amply available in the bottle) cerveza- beer ola- hello si- yes

<Content>amazing beach We just returned last night and had a great time. My husband, 11year old daughter and myself have travelled to Puerto Vallarta, Cancun, Bahamas, Mayan Riviera and Florida and this is how we felt the Bavaro stacked up. Amazing beach - fun waves for boogie boarding. Never had any problem getting a spot on the beach. Great shade spots with lovely breeze. Grounds are breathtaking. Pool is great with lots of little alcoves for privacy. Entertainment at night was so-so but usual for most resorts. Resort is huge so bring comfortable walking shoes. The food was alright but not great. We did not get sick but were careful. This resort definately caters to the Europeans most I spoke to found that the North Americans really took a back seat. All the past reviews about rude French and Germans unfortunately true - but we didn't let it bother us. I would recommend the VIP package, it makes booking restaraunts alot easier. I found the rooms clean, spacious and overall above average. My daughter had a great time and met friends to hang with. I didn't see much of the kids club though. We never really concerned ourselves because she felt too old for it. If you are taking kids I would recommend those 2 way radios or walkie talkies, the resort is so huge it is easy to lose track and very difficult to find. Overall A great place, nice people, spectacular beach. The real draw back was the food. We are not picky eaters but the food was repeated pretty much daily. My daughter did love the pasta bar though which was available pretty much everyday. Language barrier was present but not a huge problem.

<Content>Bavaro Princess was ABSOLUTLEY MAGNIFICENT!!! Must GO!! My fiance, Brandon, and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess Feb 28th-March 6th...It was such a beautiful place to be!! A gorgeous beach, wonderful staff that are so funny and nice. Awesome rooms like condos,all marbled floors and counters, Living room, front patio, sit in kitchen, a lovely bedroom and huge bathroom. I have nothing bad to say about this resort, and i am a hard girl to please! The food is a little different but certainly not Bad. The dominicans live a different culture than Americans, therefore they do many things different. There are many excursions to take..Much Fun!!! Not too exciting is the night life...however you can drink whatever you want, as much as you want and make your own excitement! I reccomend this resort very much to everyone!!! I wish i was still there.

<Content>Wonderful Time at Bavaro We (family of 4) just came back from a week stay at Bavaro Princess and enjoyed it tremendously. The grounds were very well kept, lots of greenery, and quite clean. People (employees) were always smiling and very friendly; however, a little Spanish do go a long way. We also found the food to be above average at the main buffet, especially Chopin. The other a la carte restaurants that we tried (Sakura (East Asian entrees), Bella Pasta (Italian) were so so. We got the VIP package (stronly recommended) and were able to check in with little delays and were placed in a room very close to the beach and pool. Plus the massage and the other extras makes it even more worthwhile.We travelled with 2 kids and spent most of the time altogether. They do have a kids program which we found useful on a couple of occasion when we needed to go shopping. Speaking of shopping, the Princess is very close to the local shopping plaza (10 minutes walk outside), or walk along the beach for about 20 minutes there is another 'flea' market by the beach -- practice your bargaining skills, you'll need it.Coming from a place where we take lot of things for granted, we found that taking along some school supplies, crayons, stickers, etc to give out (along with some tip money) really brighten up the days of the cleaning ladies, trolley drivers, and some wait staff. The supplies are also very good to take and give out on the excursion that takes one to a local school.

<Content>Beautiful Beach, Great Golf and lots of Sunshine My husband and I and another couple both in our 40's just returned from a weeks stay at the Bavaro Princess on February 29th. We were not disappointed in the least with this resort. The weather was A1 during our entire stay. We golfed every day at the Cocotalgolf course and were not disappointed with the course. The greens and fairways were meticulously maintained and the staff was friendly. There was no toilet on each nine holes so for those women out there be prepared. There were three nine hole courses to play and we enjoyed each course. It is best to show up first thing in the morning and take the 6:30am shuttle from the hotel. The shuttle comes every hour and will not wait if you are late. The club house was beautiful and we would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys a good game of golf. The hotel suites were as expected and we realy enjoyed the balcony with our suite. We took the VIP package and feel that it was well worth it. Just having the VIP concierge to book our dinners was a real time saver. The massage by the pool was OK but not what I would call a great massage. It was more a light massage with a generous amount of lotion. We did not take the horse back ride because we were busy golfing. It was nice to have the robe in the room and we took advantage of consuming the better alcohol available with the VIP. The restaurants were OK but not great food. The best meal we had was the evening we ate at the Chinese restaurant. The Lice restaurant was OK but the food was not worth the extra charge. Any of the wine available at the restaurants tastes watered down but for an extra fee you can get a better bottle of wine. The buffet restaurants are good and you should never go hungry. We loved the beach. The beach was clean and the water was just perfect for swimming in. Be prepared to see some topless bathers. There was no service on the beach but the bar was close by to get drinks. The evening entertainment was very good. We were very impressed with the quality of dancers and singers they had. The disco is not one for the young. We did not go there but were told that the resort next door had a very good disco. We saw the young people getting home from the disco at 6:30am when we were leaving for golf. All in all we would rate this resort as a four star resort, mainly because of the not so great food and I felt the rooms could have been cleaner. But if you are looking for a great week away in the sun at a pleasant resort with all the amenities I would recommend this resort.

<Content>Absolutely Gorgeous We have just came back from the princess and thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. The grouunds were fantastic. Our only tiny complaints would be that there wasnt enough sun loungers beside the pool or on the beach so you have to get up early to get one!! and also the food wasn't always fantastic but we always found something we liked as there was such a huge choice. We had a meal in the Licey, which there is a supplement of $25 for and it was worth it as the food was lovely and the service impressive. We always found the staff nice although some of them didn't speak very good english but they did try and we also tried to speak Spanish to them!! We would deffinately go back!

<Content>Romantic and Breathtaking After reading all the reviews, my boyfriend and I were getting a little worried. We thought it was just the fussy and uptight folks that just didn't know how to relax and enjoy life. And that's exactly what it was!! We returned on Feb. 27,/04 and we talk about it all the time. This place is by far, the most romantic resort we have ever stayed at. The staff were great, what service! After dinner, while enjoying a cappuccino, a waiter offered us a glass a champagne, another time, after lunch, we were brought over Baileys on ice for myself and Cognac for my boyfriend, without even asking. We had the VIP package, and was well worth it. I truly felt like a princess the entire week. The resort (grounds) are absolutely breathtaking, never seen so many palm trees in one location. People need to respect their language, and at least try to speak Spanish, but half English and some hand gestures works as well. Some people refuse to every say leche which is milk, they would rather just milk, which is just rude in my opinion. If you show them you are trying , it certainly goes a long way. Like so many others have said, and it's worth repeating a thousand times, go with an open mind, relax, have the anything goes/whatever attitude, and you are guaranteed to have a great time. We can't say enough great things about the Princess Bavaro, the food, service, the grounds, the people, all outstanding. In our opinion this resort is definitely a five-star, not a 4 1/2, if you get the VIP package. So don't have any doubts at all, go and have a great time!!!

<Content>Paradise! Punta Cana the most beautiful place I've ever seen. The beach was absolutley beautiful, the sand was white as sugar, and the water clean and blue. The hotel did have its flaws, first of all. Checking in took aprox. an hour as you stood in line with aprox. 100 people from all other tour operators and 2 people checking you in. The food when we arrived was excellent, the buffets were unbelievable. They were huge with every type of dish imaginable, but we noticed the quality of lowered as our trip went on. However I found breakfast to be the best, and stay away from the seafood resturant, we all got sick, the Italian resturant was the best. I felt sorry for the guy at the snack bar on the beach that was slaving over a hot grill for hours as everyone yelled at him for taking too long.***WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT MANY OF THE EMPLOYEES THERE ARE VERY POOR AND EARN AROUND $25 A MONTH FROM THE HOTEL. PLEASE BE PATIENT AND TIP THEM, BECUASE TIPS IS HOW THEY MAKE THIER LIVING*** The grounds we unreal, absolutly magnificent! The only flaw was the size of the Princess, HUGE. If your suite is by the main entrance or in the middle of the resort your in for quite a walk to beach, especially if you can't catch the one of the mini trains that travels around the resort every 10 mins. *I'm a cluber and was disappointed with nightly entertainment, it was pathetic to any adult! Every night they had a kids show in the main lobby with clowns. There was a night club on the resort that played Euro, not Euro they played in Canada or the USA. I mean Enrique Iglesas all night to 17 year old from spain. I no friggin beach parties, I was gonna start one my self, ah next time at the Ocean Bavaro perhaps. If your looking to relax Punta Cana is heaven, but there is no night llife at the Princess.

<Content>breathtaking dream vacation My boyfriend and I stayed over at Bavaro Princess for a week in mid- February. I have to say it was truly an unbelieveable experience. The Bavaro Princess was an absolutely gorgeous resort. Here are some of the reasons why I found it so incredible. As soon as you open the door to the rooms, your heart stops from the interior design. The bed placed between two poles above two steps from the main floor with a fan over is incredible. The maintenance of the resort was excellent and clean. The beach was beautiful and there were always activites running throughout the day from aerobics to volleyball games. The night life there wasn't too great however it was relaxing and peaceful to walk around the resort. The shows were very entertaining as well. A problem with the pace was the language barrier which caused a bit of frustration. You ask for two drinks you get one... you ask for no milk you get half a mug of milk in your coffee.. Bring a spanish dictionary with you.... or a friend who knows Spanish well. I found that shopping at the markets was frustrating. There were no set prices on merchandise and if you don't bargain you will end up paying 20 times more for something than it's actually worth. It gets frustrating because it takes forever to convince salesmen that they're ripping you off. The food was a concern during the trip. It was way tooo rich.. Oil and butter is overused in all dishes. My boyfriend became extremely sick the last three days to a point where he ay have needed to be hospitalized Beware what you put in your mouth!!! During our days we would leave little presents for the maids while they cleaned up our rooms.. however, one day we did not put a gift and we reallized that things were not replaced in our room. So make sure you tip well! Overall, workers in the resort were always cheerful, and ensured that you were having a good time. They are highly energetic and enthusiastic. Check in was not a problem and neither was checking out however we would have missed our bus to go back to the airport during our departure if we had not chosen to leave earlier because when we asked front desk when we should check out we were told a time 2 hours after when we really left. Once again language barrier had come to a great disadvantage. A downturn to the resort as a whole is that it is a little bit too big. If you want to get food or anything it is qute a distance to walk and even had to take bues to get around.. Well I didn't mind cuz it was cardio... Overall, there were tns of activities available like kayaking which was really fun, parasailing which was an unbelieveable experience. Luckily the weather was perfect too. Princess Bavaro is the place to be if you are planning a trip to Punta Cana. When you go book your trip for 2 weeks because 1 week is going to just FLY BY! Have an awesome trip! Alexandria:)

<Content>beautiful!!! Just arrived home a few days ago. I had to post because I must say I did read this every week so I could see what others thought good and bad. My husband and I went down with two other couples when reading the posts I was thinking oh I hope I made the right decision on where to stay and I must say I DID. First of all when we arrived we checked in and went straight to our room they were beautiful no musty smell although I did bring an air freshener that I didn't need clean I can't say anything bad about that our rooms were spotless the maid service is unbelievable our room was cleaned everyday by the time we got back from breakfast clean sheets everyday, mopped floors not a bit of dirt the maid even lines up your shoes and straightens up your toiletries I did leave little dollar store gifts and a couple of dollars everyday and had flowers in my room almost everyday. We did purchase the VIP package and I would say do that there are some good and bad with that.. your room is on the quieter side and much more relaxed (the building) brand new just opened at the end of last year, we could eat where ever we wanted to we were not tied into the buffet or only few al a cartes. We were able to pick a special restaurant to eat in 1 time where others had to pay nice but could give or take that food not to good. We ate at the steak house that was very good, seafood not great lobster don't try mushy not like here at all. Others were different not like home but you are in a 3rd world country believe what you read go with an open mind...none of us ever went hungry there is something for everyone. Another thing you got with the VIP was top shelf liquor OK where do I start with that imported beer none around they never heard of such a thing (it was posted on the site). drinks are good you have to ask for gasoline don't worry it still isn't much but its a fun time. We also had with the package massage omg that was great not on the beach at the spa.. beautiful!! We had horse back riding although we didn't do that our friends took a sperate trip (not included) 2 hours through the beaches and mountains they said some beautiful things to see and well worth it. VIP were able to use the non motorized water sports on the beach we did and had a blast. We also did another trip (not incluced) with speed boats and snorkeling never did that before and am so glad that I did a must see!! I must say something about the staff for anyone who said they never smiled or say hello you must have not lifted your head because they all were the friendliest people never did anyone walk by you and not say hello or smile they are happy always singing and smiling they couldn't do enough for us. I don't speak a word of Spanish and never really had a problem with anyone for those who say that other vavationers are ignorant never found any of that either couldn't find a mean person. we did have a couple of days with no hot water some were all in an up roar yes it was hard to shower but what do you want them to do about they say you are in the Dominican if they could get you hot water I'm sure they would have that's how nice they all are. All of us did get a touch of the runs and none of us drank the water. Guest services also with VIP Sharon is wonderful if you can deal with her do it she will jump through hoops for you to have a great time and won't steer you wrong like some!! Shopping is a pain in the butt be ready! They guide you in the stores and are up your butt the whole time don't ever give them what they ask for go low low again believe what you read. Well I could go on and on we all had a wonderful time lots of laughs beautiful beaches and grounds clean clean clean. Yes I would go back in a minute but probably won't only because there are to many other places to go and see. I would say go and have a wonderful time!!! Keep a open mind and have the time of your life ENJOY :)

<Content>Highly recommend this hotel We stayed at the Bavaro Princess Jan 28-Feb 11,2004. Our party consisted of eight people who liked to do a variety of different things. We read all the reviews both good  bad but thought this place looked great. I have travelled extensively in Americas, Carrebean, Europe, Aisia  this is one of the nicest places I have been. The hotel was beautiful, clean, beach was fantastic  the staff the best  freindliest I have ever been. The beach was white sand, no rocks, no weeds  no peddlers on the beach to bug you. If you want to buy stuff there were two areas that they had shops on the beach. The food was great  the waiters were a lot of fun. If you have fun with them they really go out of their way to do the same to you. We found that even if you did not tip it really made no difference(not like a lot of other countries). If you leave a couple of dollars at the bar  for the waiters they really appreciate it but do not expect it. The places to eat had a good variety  lots to choose from. If you picked something you did not like don't eat it! I really do not know why anyone would complain about anything at this resort? We walked the beach for miles  looked at a lot of hotels. A lot of them looked very nice but this hotel had the best section of the beach. The entertainers are the ones that do the beach activities  really make the trip fun. We speak very little Spanish  had no problem communicating with the staff. The bartenders, waiters  entaintaners speak reasonable english. Even the maids  gardners that do not speak english still try to help you. A little effort  patience goes a long way. We found the Dominican people very warm  friendly (even the pushy vendors). We highly recommed this resort  all eight of our party will return within the next couple of years.

<Content>Great time at Bavario Princess.....Don't Worry, Be Happy! Had 10 Days at the Bavaro Princess in February. Recommend you take the VIP pkg. It is well worth it. The trains around the property are great. I have trouble walking and the train/tram really helped me out. My wife walked the grounds for 1 hour each morning for exercise. Truly a beautiful place especially considering they had to carve it out of a rain forest.We did not go to the seafood restaurant. If it swims, we don't eat it. But all the rest were fine. We left the biggest tip at the Licey gourmet restaurant. Not only the food and service was great but the wine was truly great. As an after dinner drink I had JB reserve scotch. Love that VIP package. Horseback riding also included and was fun. Had the massage too! Found the pools clean and the 'eye candy' just fine!Check out our website...Dominican page for a photo review of our time there: http://broadcasters.tripod.com Enjoy the Bavarro Princess.....we certainly did,BTW attitude means so much. Make up your mind to have a fun vacation and you probably will. SMILE a lot....it goes a long way. So will a dollar or two for a tip.enjoy

<Content>Beware of this resort Beware of this resort. I recently went to the Bavaro Princess for 5 days with my daughter. This was my second time visiting the Dominican Republic, although my first at this resort. I had purchased the VIP package but my stay there was frightening. My room was broken into twice while I was there. I have never been so terrified at a vacation. I spent a lot of money on this vacation and it was a total waste. I am one of these people that hardly complains and I was looking forward to this vacation for once. I couldn't wait to get home. The staff ignored me when I told them what happened and didn't do anything to help me. I would strongly urge everyone to go somewhere else. Better be sae than sorry at this resort.

<Content>A true holiday paradise :) After doing a lot of research on where to stay in Punta Cana, the Bavaro Princess was by far the best choice out of the 20 something hotels located here. My girlfriend and I (both in our 20's) stayed at the Bavaro Princess from Feb.14-Feb.21. The beach was very nice although the ocean is a little rough because it's the Atlantic side. The food was good, yet I found the meat to be undercooked and they used a lot of oil and butter. The grounds are well-maintained and are beautiful to look at with all the animals running around. The rooms are breathtaking, definitely the best ones I have stayed in to date and I have traveled to 10 other locations which to name a few are: Acapulco, Cancun, Belize, Camaguey, Varadero, San Andres, Puerto Plata and more. The nightlife is lacking, yet the interestingly fun nightly entertainment shows make up for it.The service was good, it seems like the Dominican's are always happy and smiling and willing to make sure your enjoying your trip to its fullest.The only real disadvantage I experienced with this resort (or Punta Cana in general) is that there's a high ratio of Europeans and a very low ratio of Non-Europeans. This made communicating with a lot of people, Dominican's and Europeans, frustrating and exhausting at times. However, if you know a little bit of Spanish and even French, then you should be fine.If your going to Punta Cana, definitely consider this excellent resort to stay at because it will be a memory of a lifetime. Have a good one!Dave

<Content>pro's and con's just got back 3 hours ago..... i've traveled the world from no stars to 5+stars. here's what i thought about punta cana and the bavaro princess:Pro's:-great beach -huge pool -nice hotel grounds (MASSIVE and a bit stinky in certain areas) -freshly made waffles and donuts for breakfast in main dining area -we LOVED the NESCAFE cafe con leche! -massages (my favorite one was done by the pool) comes out to be $1 per minute -cute little monkey+ parrots that you can take pics with -lots of birds, roosters, chickens... around -large room -friendly staff (mostly) -bella pasta's pizzaCon's:-food is a bit scary. i am from NY and have high-ish standards so... -no water pressure in shower -room is a bit smelly -there is a language barrier but most locals/staff know a bit English  French -most store keepers were VERY pushy and hike up the prices 600%, be prepared to haggle! -the city was very poor and sad to see -it rained 3 of the 7 days and was overcast 3 =1 day of good sun -couldn't find a good frozen alcoholic beverage and had a hard time ordering different drinks at the bars(and drinks came in small glasses) -got charged for laundry service we never used (took a while to correct at check-out)Tours:-we LOVED the 4x4 quad trip=went to the beach, in a cave, saw some of the country $52 per person w/ 2 on 1 bike (BEST PART OF TRIP!) *got very muddy* -loved parasailing $43 per person w/ 2 at a timeADVICE:-plan to walk ALOT! (bring bandaids) -bring long-sleeved clothing for cold and/or rainy nights -bring and use bug spray (especially at night) and don't leave your room door open. -leave the maid $1-2 a day and even a note (written in spanish, i used a small spanish/english dictionary) and let them know what you need stocked. -DO NOT EAT THE HOT-DOG'S!!!!! -go early to beach/pool and reserve a chair with your towels -go to the market down the beach for cheapest prices (make a right when you walk out onto the beach, it's about a 15-20 minute walk) -make dinner reservations 8am for the next nights dinner -if you have children know that people are topless at the beach and pool

<Content>Fantastic!! My sister and her then boyfriend decided to get married in the Dominican. The wedding organizer at princess bavaro made all the arrangements so easy. She was pleasant and helpful. When we arrived, we were delighted to see the resort. It is the most beautiful place on earth. The people are wonderful, the food is great. Even the entertainment is great. We had such a good time. I would and have reccomended this place to friends.

<Content>Great time, Great place ! We just returned Feb.15 from our 7 day too short stay at the Bavaro Princess it was fabulous. My husband and I and 2 kids 8 yrs. and 4yrs had a great family holiday. I was worried when I read some of the earlier negative reviews but I went expecting anything can happen. I wanted to write this review because I found that there were not too many comments regarding the kids club and activities. I have nothing but positive comments to make. We were in Punta Cana last year at another resort (Tropical Princess) and were disappointed. We are definitely happy we gave Punta Cana another chance. The entertainment staff kept the action happening all day long around the pool and kept the kids playing and happy all day, but they were not too pushy for those who just wanted to relax. There was a kids show in the evening at 8:45 pm with a clown they sing and dance an get the kids to participate.The food was exceptional there were 6 a la carte restuarants that were excellent. Steak, seafood, pastas,pizzas, all fruits, just a great variety. and the desserts were wonderful too. All day long eating and drinking and having fun, this does not sound negative!! I must recommend the VIP package it did give added perks and a better location on the property. The property is stunning and huge so having a suite close to the pool and beach did help! VIP have there own concierge so making reservations for the a la carte restaurant was very quick no long lines. And the bar is full deluxe bar with VIP we had Remy Martin cognac, Gran Marnier you name it VIP could have it. We also had beach towels delivered to our room and a free massage for myself and my husband, (it was nice!!) and free horseback riding, plus a bottle of rum and 3 cigars. A free dinner at Licey the a la carte not included in the all inclusive (big lobster, steak )It was worth it! I highly recommend this resort.If I did have anything negative to say, it would only be that the language barrier was evident many of the staff do not speak english so it does get a little tricky, but to there defense Punta Cana is attracting traveller world wide we met people from France, Germany, Austria, Peru, England, Czech Rep., Chile, USA, Russia they have so many visitor is was fantastic meeting such a diverse crowd of travellers. Go, relax and have a great time!

<Content>Miss it already! I'm a member of Royal holidy. I travel 2 maybe 3x's a year. I've been to Europe, Africa and all over the Caribean. The Bavaro Princess is one of the best places I've ever vacationed. The grounds are flawless. The staff is always smiling and upbeat. The beach is perfect. I walk the beach during sun rise a breath taking sight. There were countless employees racking the beach taking away seaweed that washed ashore overnight. this was done every morning. The food was also very good. It may not be what you are used to. if you want more of the same go to Florida. If you want to go to another country and feel as though you've travel to another part of the world this is the place for you. English is not a priority on the resort. they may have to find some one for you if you have a detailed question. However all you need to ask is where's the beach, lunch or shopping. the tour people speak english and they will find you. i do not speak a lick of spanish and I got a long fine. I went to a sugar cane. tabacco plantation and i also went to a cock fight. language was not an issue. My wife and I have a rule that the world is too big to go to the same place twice. I'm gonna have to break that rule.

<Content>a real honest detailled review First I have to say what I generally think and what I experiecend during my several stays: AWESOME!! INCREDIBLE!! So I just decided to write this review because I can't read all these crappy bad reviews anymore from people who just seem to unable to relax and have problems with other cultures. I have been 3 times (always for 2 weeks) to exactly the same resort and I was always 100% satisfied! We never had any problems with the check in. We had to wait also about an half an hour till we were checked in but that'S absolutly no problem! Really you should be able to understand that you are not the one and only who wants to get to your room and to the beach and that the hotel can't afford 40 people working at the counter! Besides that we were always very respectfull and friendly treated by all the staff! Rember where you are! You are on an carribean island. The mentality is very different from the Europeans and the Americans. They never look on the watch and they just go into the day. So when you meet them they always will smile at you or try to start a conversation. They are just never sad even while they are working you can look at the guy who is cleaning the pool the tram drivers they are always smiling. If you are an positive person this really can influence you too and you have to smile, too. Isn't that just exactly what you expect of your holidays?? So it's really not fair to say anything bad about the staff! They are one of the friendliest people I have ever met, and I have been to really many resorts in many different cuntries! If you just want to be treated like someone special and want to stand over the staff stay at home and go to a restaurant or the next bigger furniture store. Of course I don't have to add that the beach is one of the best you can go to!!! Next to the hotel to the left and right there are plenty of hotels and no one really no one has a nicer beach than the princess. The water right in front of the other hotels is full off weed and there are plenty of corals so you can hardly go in and swim!!! So if you want to see a beautifull beach there's no other choice just the princess!! Really I saw almost all the other hotels live and if you believe it or not the difference is imense! What else do I have to say....ok the grounds. I don't have to say anything to the grouonds one word is enough: perfect! So there are some bad reviews (from weird people) but no one, any of them wrote a single bad word about the beach, pool, or grounds....it's just the best you can get! So if you have any problems with the staff or the food remember that you are on journey in a foreign country and if you don't like it stay at home do and eat just the same thing you do everyday. But it's not the sense of travelling! In conclusion I would say that it's an awesome resortand I will go back as soon as I can. If you are thinking of going to an beautifull carribean beach go there!

<Content>Withoug hesitation......totally beautiful....... This hotel was excellent. I can't beleive some of the reviews I had read before going. Y he reviews are simply not true, at all.......The beach is incrediable. The rooms are clean, and spacious(the VIP Package is best). The food was tasetfully done, simple so you were sure of what you were eating. It was not one of these  ALL AMERICAN  places that are over done and people line up for the famous all you can eat into a new waist size, kind of place. Go with your family and friends and kick back and enjoy a lovely atmosphere..........

<Content>spectacular resort What a great resort. The staff is very friendly the food was awesome at Chopin and Gaucho, we ate lobster, shrimp, fish and steak, they have plenty to choose from. Our favorite was Chopin, the scenery was beautiful and the staff was very attentive. Remember to make reservations for all of the restaurants. The grounds were impecable. I never saw a piece of paper on the ground. This is also a great place for children. We took our 6 year old son and he was kept busy with a few day activies for kids as well as the kids club at the stage in the lobby. Every evening at 8:30 they have songs, dancing and activites for the children. He lived for kids club. The resort is huge. Lots of terrain and rainforest animals. The pool was huge, lots of shade and sun. The beach was the best I have ever seen, white sand and aqua blue water. Get the VIP package when you check in. Go directly to the vip line. It's worth it!!!!! It's only 15.00 us dollars per person per day and you get alot of extra's like dinner at Licey (75.00 value) a free helicopter ride (60.00 value) 1 massage (75.00 value) all your premium liquors (absolute, sky, stoli etc..)(I saved 100.00). I hope you go, you will have a great time!!

<Content>Amazing Beach and Surroundings I read a lot of reviews on this site before i went and most of them put me off going there - everything was supposed to be awful..the food...the service...the facilities...what i found was the opposite. The service was good and the food was great considering it is a tropical island. The tropical gardens that the apartments are set in are just stunning with a stroll at sunset a magical experience. By tfar the best thing though about this hotel is the beach and the pool area - the beach is the best i have been to and the water is so blue and clear. I would go back here without hesitation.

<Content>Great Holiday Our family just returned today! Mom, Dad, 13 year old and 10 year old - and my daughter insists we write a review since the negative ones we read took all our anticipation of our trip away. We had a great holiday! We have been on a cruise, to the Bahamas, done Disney and Myrtle Beach and this holiday ranks number 1. The staff are wonderful - I am only sorry that I didn't tip them more - because they never expected it. One waitress gave my daughter a gift of hair elastics! No they don't speak English - it is a Spanish speaking country, and you are visiting it - have fun with it and learn something new!Food was good, sometimes better, sometimes not, but considering that this is an impoverished island the selection was impressive. No one in my group needed all the Imodium I packed!Activities were awesome - aerobics in the surf, my son played beach volleyball everyday, shows were very good by resort standards. We loved the lobby area - great place to have a drink and hang out.Beach - beautiful, pool great, ground unbelievably clean and beautiful.Why only a 4/5 rating? Probably 1/4 of the women were topless at the beach or the pool - we are just not used to that. (Old women, heavy women, big, small etc.) Many men in Speedos! (Regardless of age, weight, etc.)We didn't find the European tourists very considerate or friendly - will NEVER visit a beach in Europe! (If I ever go!)Overall, a great trip - enjoy!

<Content>We would go back in a minute! My husband and I went here for our honeymoon during the last week of December, and throughout the week of Christmas. We absolutely loved this resort! The food was wonderful. Even La Hispaniola, the walk-in buffet restaurant for which you do not need to make reservations, had great food. We went there three times for dinner, and every time they had a different selection of things. Vegetarians, big meat eaters, picky eaters ... there was something for every type of eater. My husband loved the meat that they grilled for you, and we both enjoyed the lobster and other seafood. For breakfast, they had a huge selection ... even six types of freshly blended fruit juices--pineapple, pear, papaya, mango, orange and other really exotic fruits. And don't get me started on the pina colada -- WOW! Just ask for not too much rum. We had the VIP package so we got to eat at the gourmet restaurant, Licey, and it was absolutely amazing. The champagne was better there and the food delectable. The only restaurant we didn't enjoy was their new Oriental one. We thought our room was wonderful and of course the grounds are breathtaking. We felt like we were in a rainforest! The bed was comfortable and clean, and they were very prompt about getting us a blanket when we called for one. We had some trouble with the toilet and then too service came right away. We found the staff extremely helpful and friendly, in no way pushy at all. We never felt pressured to tip, so we did tip to those who worked hard. It is such a poor country and the people work very very hard. One waiter we met lives in Puerto Plata, 9 hours away. He works at the resort for 13 days straight, takes a bus north for 12 hours, to see his family for two days. It's really sad. I agree that the language barrier does pose a bit of a problem, but luckily I know a bit of Spanish and I also speak French fluently, so it was okay communicating. As for the VIP package, I would recommend it. For one thing, there is the gourmet dinner you get for free. We also took advantage of the free massage and horseback riding. My husband enjoyed the rum and cigars too! The definite plus about VIP is that to make the reservations for dinner, you don't have to go back to the lobby, the way non VIP do. There is a VIP concierge who is available during certain times (always we were able to find a time to meet him, that didn't clash with our plans) and you make them with him. Also, his office is near your hotel room, in the VIP area, so it's not at all far to go. We also thought the beach was wonderful, the sand was like white sugar, there was enough shade with the trees, and even when we got there late we always managed to find two chaise lounges for ourselves, although the ocean was very, very rough. I would be nervous with young children in there. The pool is enormous though. I didn't feel too clean in the pool due to the swim up bar. How many people don't feel the need to get off their stool to go to the washroom after downing who knows how many drinks? Not many, is my bet. One reviewer said that the VIP package was not clearly explained to him at check-in, and at first we felt the same way. However, they do give you a package of information and you MUST read it right away. Everything was a lot clearer to us after we did that, it was just a shame we didn't read it through sooner. We have been back a little over a month and we still talk about Bavaro Princess with much fondness. We would go back again, in a second, and only hope we will be so lucky. I recommend this hotel VERY highly to anyone! Just remember to go with an open mind -- not everything will be perfect, but this is supposed to be a vacation! Not everyone speaks English, but if you want to go somewhere where they all do, DR is not the place for you. Maybe England is.

<Content>Trip of a Lifetime After reading many ratings from people all over the U.S.A and Canada, My friends and I were a little apprehensive about going to this resort! Man, was everybody wrong who put a bad review on the net about the Bavaro Princess! We returned from there on Jan. 29/04. Yes, the resort is huge, but beautiful and CLEAN! The staff work very hard to keep everything beautiful there! We overheard a couple who had been to the Dominican many times before, and they said the Bavaro Princess was one of the nicest in Punta Cana. All the resteraunts were good. The Licey was exceptional. You really have to realize though, it's not like the food we cook at home. If you are looking for an excellent excursion, try the Outback Safari! Not only are you going up into the mountains and seeing great countryside, you're going to have a great tour guide and fun as well! There were always spare loungers to lay on the beach, you may have to go down the beach a little to find them. We never experienced any language barrier with the staff. It may have taken a little bit to try to communicate with them, but most of them knew English enough to answer basic questions or to help us. ALL STAFF are very quick to say Hola and give you a smile! The only bad things we saw were the rude tourists! We would definately recommend staying at this resort. We definately will be returning!!

<Content>Great Vacation We just got back from the Bavaro Princess today! had a great time. Just some information for future guests. Look at your map once you check in, the resort is very large and spread out(which we liked) once you look a the map you can easily find your way around. Food was above our expectations, Chopin(the best) and El Goucho were great. For breakfast we reccomend Chopin as it is not near as busy and has everything to offer that the main buffet restaurant has. For lunch the pasta buffet at Bella Pasta was great as was was the grilled chicken at the El Goucho buffet. The best thing about lunch is there are so many options right at the beach since Bella Pasta, El Goucho and the beach grill are all located right on the beach. The beach is great for swimming, boogie boarding and body surfing. There is a roped off swimming area along the beach which is somewhat limiting since there are a large amount of boats going by just on the other side of the rope. Activities such as Hobie Cats, kayaking, banana boat and parasailing are all great. I don't recommend doing the snorkel tour , large surf and fair visibility. VIP package we felt was well worth the extra $100 each Cdn. This package gave us a 1/2 hour massage(awsome), horesback riding, and dinner at Licey(good) as well as premium drinks(Corona, Miller Genuine Draft, Becks, Johney Walker black label, Beefeater Gin) These drinks are available at all the bars, just ask. Language was only an issue a few times and was easily handled by some patience, hand gestures, and an awareness that you are the one visiting a spanish speaking country. Staff was very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Bring your Immodium!!!!! Our(my husband and me) vacation at the Bavaro Princess in March 2003 got off to a terrible start at check in. We thought we had paid for a VIP room, when we had in fact paid for a VIP package. The difference? All the rooms are the same and you have no say in where you are placed. The package included a 1/2 hr massage, small bottle of rum, remote control for the TV, 2 cigars, supposedly easier dinner reservation making. All in all, not worth the $400US we paid. We had to ask for our VIP status at check in, and due to the language barrier, they could not explain what VIP meant. The man sent us off to find our room with incorrect directions - and this resort is huge! They use golf carts and 'bus stops' to get people around. This did not bother us once we learned our way around because we love to walk, but after walking around for an hour trying to find our room we were very frustrated. Once we got to our room the key did not open it!!!! So we had to find our way back for a correct key! We were so hot, tired and frustrated we wanted to go home. BRING IMMODIUM IF YOU DO GO!!!! You will definately need it. We needed it for 2 weeks after returning!! Also the resort is 90+% European and they were not very friendlly toward us. We were 'booed' on stage at the show one night!! The canadians were awesome and very friendly toward us but we felt very alone. We were charged for a bottle of wine we ordered at their most elegant resturant, but we did not mind. The food at this resturant - Licey - was awesome but you could only eat there once during a week stay, and they expected a tip here. We would not go back for these reasons -- to many other resorts out there to try. I will make sure we get a proper reception next time. It's so important and sets the tone for your entire stay. We did meet great people, all from Canada, who 'took us under their wing' and were very nice to us. We've been to Jamaica 3 times with 'no problem' so that's where we'll go back in 2004. We loved Couples Ochos Rios and Swept Away. Go to one of these!!!!

<Content>Paradise in The Carribean Just returned on the 23rd of Jan. This place was beyond my expectations. Everyone here was so friendly and helpful when they could be. We will definately be coming back to Bavaro Princess and hopefully all of our family will too. The only thing they didn't have was Rye and Gingerale. I made due with everything else they offered. Hats off to all the staff who put in long hard days to keep this resort looking so beautiful.

<Content>Visited Under Prior Ownership We visited this hotel under prior ownership--Melia. We went there because of a superior experience with Melia in Costa Rica (Playa Conchal).The place may have deteriorated since the two years that we were there, but I could not disagree more with the negative reviews. The food was excellent (but we do not go there for gourmet dining--not to the Caribbean, huh??). All the facilities were spotlessly clean and daily maintenance was outstanding.Perhaps the present ownership is sub-standard, but one should consider a Melia property if you have doubts. Their properties are top notch.

<Content>Reality speaks louder than words!!! Returned after a 2 week stay at Bavaro Princess on January 17. Had my doubts about the resort prior to going because of all the negative reviews, but decided to take a chance. Let's say that 95% of negative reviews you read are TRUE! Beautiful landscaping, beach and pool area. The rooms are o.k., but look better on photos. Our cupboards were falling apart and some guests didn't have any hot water. We were lucky with that I guess. The check-in will be a hassle and that's a guarantee, don't expect the room to be ready, even at 3:30 pm, it won't be, not even for the VIP guests! You will also not get the room you request, doesn't matter how much in advance notice you give them. Be prepared to hassle for your requested room. The resort is a bit too large and you do waste a lot of time on transportation. But the main problem there is the FOOD! Same food everyday, nothing really different, it's either way too salty or too oily, since they fry everything in oil - even your bacon. A La Carte restaurants serve pretty much the same food you get in the Buffet, it's just in a different format. You do need Immodium, due to problems you may experience due to the ingestion of that food. Would not go there again!!!

<Content>Vacay Having booked our stay months in advance we were getting a little nervous due to some of the polarized reviews posted on this site. To those who are considering this resort, the truth is somewhere in between.The grounds are amazing, the staff is courteous and the overall experience is about average for the amount spent. The short-comings are in the details...the food is good but not exceptional. All preparation areas/buffets are clean and none of our party of six was sick. For being so close to the sea, the seafood was disappointing. Some people ate there every night though so...to each their own.The rooms are inconsistently cleaned...so many people are tipping with dollar store trinkets that $'s yielded better results. $1 a day was enough.My parents got the VIP package which was well worth the money. All the Remy Martin VSOP you can drink. The Licey restaurant is good by Toronto standards...for the money.Overall we had a great trip.

<Content>Wonderful time! January 10 - 17/04. We were very pleased with all that Bavaro Princess had to offer. Our suite was lovely, the food was tasty and the selection was great. Lots to do - or nothing - whatever you prefer. The beach is lovely as are the well-maintained grounds. Go. Relax and have fun. I hope you love it as much as we did. We'd love to go back.

<Content>Fun in Paradise Hi there! I just got back from the Bavaro Princess and thought I owed Trip Advisor a report since I read so many before I left! We went for a wedding with about 30 people and had a FANTASTIC time. I'll break it down.Hotel: Beautiful large suites surrounded by palm trees. We loved our King size bed and spacious air-conditioned room. The grounds are very well maintained with tropical flowers and creatures around every corner! (Please visit the Titi monkeys!) Very spread out and peaceful. There are always little shuttles to get you around if you don't feel like walking. The beach is clean and very pretty and private with lounge chairs and little huts to stay out of the sun.Staff: The staff are fairly relaxed and friendly. You can expect some difficulty communicating if you don't speak spanish, but you should be able to get your message across eventually. Remember, you are on island time so don't be too impatient! Our maid was a bit forgetful even though we tipped, but the rest of our group had excellent service. If you want to leave stuff for them, they apparently appreciate school supplies, your old makeup/toiletries, and of course dollars!Food/Drink: You can eat/drink around the clock pretty much. The boys enjoyed gallons of Presidente beer, while I enjoyed the Mai tais, coco locos, and daiquiris. The swim up bar is pretty fun. The main buffet the Hispaniola is nice but definitely make your reservations and try all of the restaurants! We had huge steaks at the El Gaucho, fabulous seafood at the El Pescador, tried new dishes at the Sakura, and the Chopin served a great variety of fish, shrimp, roast beef, etc if you can't decide. There are also custom pasta bars if you like that. If you can't get a reservation, we just just showed up and did a little pleading and got in. Of course a tip would help too. At the beach there is the Mac Princess for good burgers  fries. We also hit the midnight buffet for pizza  wings many times!Wedding: Our bride  groom moved the wedding from the beach to the garden because it was a very windy day. It rained, but the ceremony was still really nice and simple. They got gorgeous photos and had a cute little musical trio.Extras: There are lots of extras and excursions that cost money if you're up for it, we did parasailing and it was well worth it! It was so much fun. The resort fills the day with free activities all day, dance lessons, water aerobics, olympics, etc. My boyfriend won the arm wrestling contest twice! If you want to shop the market down the beach is supposed to be a lot less agressive than the one in town where I went. Make sure you go with a good barterer. You can pretty much always pay less than half of what they are asking, just walk away if they so no and they will follow! I got my hair braided for $20 US at the market which was definitely reasonable, I did not try to get it for less. At the resort it is $50 but other girls bartered at the market and got it down to $3 for half a head of braids.Overall I had SUCH a good time, I can't wait to go back! If you have doubts about going, put them out of your head and be open to having the time of your life =)

<Content>Some Good, Some Bad My family stayed here for the last week in December. It was Ok, but we would not go back. There was a MAJOR language barrier so i would reccomend a Spanish/English dictionary if you are not familiar with the language.The rooms were beautiful with great balconies. However, sometimes the rooms did not get cleaned till 5:00. The beach was excellent and had clean sand and crystal waters. The pool was fridgid and kind of dirty. You must get up early to get good seats but either way you end up getting packed in like sardines. The food was bad. During the week all one of my kids would eat bread and french fries. Also, if you like maple syrup bring your own because they do not have there nor do they have Heinz ketchup. In my opinion the VIP package was not worth it. the cigars are horrible, the bottle of rum is tiny, and i probably would not have gotten a massage if it was not included in the package. Also, Licey the restaurant that you eat for free in with the VIP package is not as good as it is made out to be. Our weather was wonderful but if you are considering going to the Dominican Republic I would not reccomend this hotel.

<Content>Go go go go go go go!!!! My husband and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess for our honeymoon December 7-21. We thought it was a beautiful huge resort. Instead of a hotel, there were huts around a huge complex, with 8 rooms to a hut. 4 on top, and 4 on the bottom. Each room has a balcony or veranda. We loved the room we were in. It was a beautiful room, and always very clean. We left little gifts or tips for the maid and she would leave fresh flowers around the room. Also, she would leave us extra towels, and overstock the mini bar (sometimes there would be extra drinks on the desk that would not fit in the fridge). Even though we did not have to tip, a little something does go a long way. We kept her happy, and she kept us happy! We thought the food was fantastic. There were, understandably, sometimes things we did not like, but there was always tons of other food available. I think people who complain about the food should remember that they are on a Caribbean holiday, not an American holiday. If you are not interested in trying new food, then of course you won't like it. There is food available just about 24/7. We were stuffed the entire vacation. Shopping-you can either go into town (very short walk) or there are also flea markets along the beach. Beware, the vendors are very aggressive. I literally had two vendors trying to pull me in two different directions at one point! I felt like a wishbone. I got a little aggravated as it was so hot in town. We preferred shopping on the beach as at least we were on the beach (what can be bad when you are on a gorgeous beach?!) and nice and cool. The second week we were there (right before Christmas) it did get quite busy. We did notice a change in the drinks then. Watered down, and the pina coladas were liquidy, never slushy, as the machines were being overwooked. The beach got quite busy as well, however never really felt over-crowded. We walked quite aways up and down the beaches, and ours was definitely one of the nicer and larger ones. One thing that really annoyed us were the people that would reserve the beach huts with a towel and then not use it all day! There were all these huts with no one using them all day. Not only that, but they are using 2 chairs per person, one under the hut and one in the sun. I curse all those that do that! Just kidding. Really our only beefs about the place (which were not many mind you) were due to fellow guests, including the ignorant french people (from France I mean, not my nice Quebec neighbours). I'm sorry, I am sure there are exceptions, but on the most part we found them to be obnoxious, rude, and self-serving. Not really a big deal though, we just ignored them when they would FINALLY move out our of our way. All in all we had a wonderful time. The staff were friendly and pleasant. Those that complain about the staff need to realize that they are making about the equivalent of $50 a week. Of course they are not going to bow down and kiss your feet. They do their job, and they do it well.  Also, there are a lot of language groups that visit that area (english, french, german, spanish, portugese to name a few). Every staff member can not be expected to know all those languages, all though amazingly there were a few who did. Go to the Bavaro Princess, it is great!!!

<Content>Awesome!  My husband and I were a little anxious about spending Christmas week at the Bavaro Princess after reading some of the horrific reviews. What were those people thinking? We loved this hotel from the moment we arrived on the property. In fact, we compared it to Hawaii. The staff was incredibly friendly. Even though there was frequently a language barrier, everyone tried to communicate and be helpful. Our room was immaculate and spacious, the food was great, and the beach was absolutely gorgeous. We did not encounter any problems at all. In fact, we and our friends would love to return same time next year.

<Content>I'm in love with Bavaro Princess What an amazing place. As soon as you arrive it's incredible, you now know that you have entered a tropical paradise. So grab yourself a dink and relax at this wonderful hotel. There was always something to eat, the animacion team is amazing and very friendly. I love you guys. And then there is the most beautiful beach I've ever seen. Even when we arrived at the beach at 10:00 there was still several decent spots to sit close to all the action. Our room was exceptionally clean. Everyone was really friendly, although the language barrior is present there is still always someone there to help. So I hope you guys enjoy your stay as much as I did. And just to note I'm going back for my third time. I have now officially fell in love with not only this hotel though Dominican Republic in general.

<Content>Would go back in a second! Just wanted to write a brief review of our recent trip. We had a wonderful time and would go back in a moment. My wife and I actually enjoyed the fact that there were so few Americans at the resort - it was fun to meet people from so many different places. The staff was very attentative and the grounds were amazing (the wildlife on the property is worth seeing). As some of the reviews have said, the bars were busy but that should be expected. And finally, the beach is the reason we went - well worth it.

<Content>what in the world? My fianc茅e and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess Nov 12-19, 2003. I was a little apprehensive after reading a lot of the reviews from this website. Let me tell you what it was like for us. We did not purchase the VIP package and we did not go with a tour. We ran into no problems whatsoever. We arrived and got a taxi. Its only $22 and it was at least a 30 minute ride. This was not a big deal. We checked in and got to our room. It was clean and did not have a problem with odor or water pressure. If we had gone without reading the bad reviews, there would be no way for us to think that it wasnt like this all the time. We were only 4 buildings from the pool and the grounds were fabulous. Everything was immaculate. The trams were frequent and would stop to pick you up and drop you off anywhere you wanted. Besides, it was only a few minute walk across the property. The beach was terrific, we went there everyday. We never had a problem finding a spot. The bars do get busy, but be realistic, what do you expect, there are a lot of people that they are trying to serve. The food was good, but dont be surprised to find it unlike American food. There are mainly Europeans and Latinos at this resort and that is to whom they cater. We ate at the buffet about half the time. I liked that you didnt have to have a reservation and there was not a dress code. We didnt have any problems getting reservations when we wanted to. The biggest problem at the resort was the other rude guests. I would like to address the people who refuse to wait their turn. Or the people who are picky and expect everyone to bend over backwards for you. The one night that we went to one of the reservation restaurants, I ordered something that I didnt like and they very pleasantly took it back and brought me something else. They were always courteous and extremely helpful. If you respect them, they will respect you. We tipped a lot, but if you look at the extreme poverty of the country, we felt it was the least we could do, it was never expected but always appreciated. So go and relax, if you have specific needs, make sure to take care of yourself.

<Content>Beautiful place, friendly staff Before visiting Bavaro Princess my wife and I read some of the comments from other visitors. We were concerned due to the number bad reviews. When we arrived we started looking for all the nuisances reported by others (bugs, mildew smell in rooms, bad food, etc.), but found none and had no problems whatsoever. From the moment we got on the bus at the airport we were greeted by the driver who was very nice and cheerful, and this was the rule for the entire trip. EVERYONE at the hotel was friendly to us and we did not have to tip anyone, nor they asked. However, after a day or two we began tipping since the D.R.s economy is extremely weak. The place is beautiful, the service is great, the food is very good, and the rooms are very nice and comfortable. (I dont work for the hotel, is my honest opinion) The beach is beautiful and the pools are great. However, if you dislike: people in general, kids, Caribbean weather, Caribbean food, etc, then just stay home. Ive been to a lot of hotels and this one is getting a bad rap on this site, its a great place. Just relax, have a Presidente and enjoy the Princess

<Content>Wonderful vacation from the beginning to the end We spent six wonderful days in Bavaro Princess from 11/25/03 to 12/1/03. We booked this vacation through Apple Vacations and were very pleased with their service.The hotel grounds are gorgeous. We checked out all the other hotels on the strip and found that ours was the most beautiful.We arrived at Punta Cana and were brought to the hotel by the bus provided by Apple Vacations. The resort is about 40 minutes from the airport. The main building of the hotel is an architectural wonder. All the stuff was very friendly and really tried to understand us, even though we don't speak Spanish. We were greeted by the front desk manager who told us that our room will be available after 3p.m. (the usual check in time). We left our luggage at the bell desk and went to the buffet restaurant La Hispaniola for lunch. The restaurant was nice, the food was good and the waiters were very courteous.Our suite was located midway between the main building, where all the evening entertainment takes place, and the beach. We were pleased with our room, although, it would be nice to have a view of the beach, which we did not. The room was clean and that was the most important thing for us, as we didn't spend much time there during the day.There are six restaurants and a fast food stand in the resort. In my opinion everyone can find something they like to eat there. We particularly enjoyed our dinners at Chopin restaurant. It's very elegant and there is live music after 8:30 p.m. nightly.The animation stuff was great. They start working early in the morning at the beach and end late at night every night in the nightly shows. At the beach we enjoyed learning to dance meringue, participating in the olympics games and beach aerobics. You really forget all your worries and enjoy yourself.At night there was a show with the clowns for kids, which our son really loved. All kids were invited to the stage where they participated in games, dancing and other activities.After the kids show there was a different dancing review for older crowd. Not all the shows were great, but they really tried to please us.We were not crazy about the beach. Even though the water was warm and the sand was very clean, there were very strong waves most of the time. We enjoyed swimming in the pools though, and especially the one with the swim up bar.I would definitely come back to this resort and recommend it to all my friends.

<Content>Thanksgiving in Punta Cana Our family of 3 arrived the day before Thanksgiving to a nice, clean room although the 3rd bed had no pillows or covers. We paid extra for the VIP package. No details were given to us during check in about what this extra entailed. We found out from other visitors. The Extra things we paid for in the VIP package were given to us on the second day. The minibar was a joke. 2 bottles of Coke, 2 bottles of Sprite,  2 bottles of water. Since we arrived late the first day we could only go to the buffet restaurant. My son had on flip flops and they would not let him in even though there were 90% women in flip flops and men in sandals. We had to hop back on the train, return to our rooms to change shoes. We found out from some other guests that reservations for the regular restaurants had to be made via telephone. When we tried to make these reservations we were told they were booked for all the 7 pm sittings. If we wanted reservations we had to eat at 10 pm. After some negotiating we managed to get into all restaurants except for Licey's. Chopin was very nice. As the other comments, there was a dribble of hot water. The beaches were beautiful. There were a lot of topless women there. Some who should have kept their tops ON!!!. At departure time our Prieto tour bus was 1 hour late in picking us up to take us to the airport. We almost missed our plane. I would not return to this destination again, especially for the price we paid. Have been to Mexico 6 times and it is MUCH better.

<Content>In reply to the trip advisor from Puerto Rico After reading the trip advisors report from Puerto Rico, I felt I had to write about a few things that may deter people from going to this hotel........We stayed there in November for one week......very recent. As for the the bellboys wanting to take your suitcases where in the carribean do they not do this ??????? I have travelled extensively to many countries and they ALL do this everywhere...Jamaica, Puerto Vallarta, Cancun, Bahamas etc..etc...this is their way of trying to earn a living, a polite no thank you and they walk away.......As for the food I don't think you can make an accurate statement after staying only a weekend......actually the chicken burgers and fries at the beach hut was the only place we did not like.....unless you are use to eating extremely greasy food......so it really is a question of taste..to each their own.Also the baggage on the returning bus, the way they do this is a lot less confusing than a busload of people grabbing at everyone elses luggage, plus if you lock your suitcases until you actually check in, there is no way anyone can put something in your luggage, which you should do anyway. I found the people very helpful and friendly, the language is a bit of a barrier but then you are in their country and those that have a problem should stay home........

<Content>Get down tonight! Go with the positive about this resort. It's a great place. It's not the Rockefeller Estate @ St.Bart for cryin outloud, but for the $$$, no other Carib Disneyland offers more for less. Great food, booze, beach, entertainemt, accommodations. And don't forget to bring your re-entry shields, the eyecandy is great. For sure, perfection isn't to be had, but as a low-budget destination, this place is unbeatable.

<Content>I would not have paid money for this trip I won this three day/two night trip to Bavarro Princess in June and took the trip this past weekend Nov 21-23, 2003. Thank goodness I did not pay for this trip or I would be fighting for my money back. The Princess bills itself as a 4 star all inclusive resort. It gets maybe 1 1/2 stars at best. From the time you step off the plane, everyone is looking for a handout. The baggage guys, the transfer operators, the bell men, everyone has something to sell you be it a dive trip or a $20 disposal camera. The grounds are pretty, but there is a lot of construction going on to a lot of the rooms and there are lots of creepy construction workers around in places that I would consider private places for paying guests. We arrived at 5pm and were told upon check in that we would only be able to eat at the main buffet that evening since not having reservations at any of the 4 resturaunts. This was no big deal to us. The bell man insisted on taking our bag from us at the front of the hotel. In fact, when we tried to wheel it away ourselves, they followed us and took it from us telling us it would only be 10 minutes to arrive to our room. We asked if this resort included all tips/gratuities. The front desk clerk said,Do you want to give me a tip? You can pay me if you like. We offered a polite smile. We arrived to our room to the strong smell of mold (we live in Puerto Rico so this was not new to us plus it had been raining quite a bit for the past week) but turned on the air conditioner to get the humidity out. the fully stocked mini bar consists of two bottles each of sprite and coke and two bottles of water and two bottles of beer. Did I mention that the refrigerator wasn't even plugged in? All of these articles were warm and there is no way to get ice besides treking all the way up to the front entry bar. A 10 minute walk. It took the bell man over 35 minutes to bring our one small bag that we were sharing to our room. My husband had to return to the front curb in the rain in order to speed up the process of retreiving our bag. All we wanted was to change clothes. We walked in the rain up to dinner with the umbrella that was provided in our room, which, by the way, was covered in black mold. The Hispanola buffet was okay. We had read reviews on this web site and avoided the fish and chinese food. I think we ate our weight in bread and cheese. The red wine is chilled, which I guess is a european thing. It was good but not great. The dessert table left little to be desired. Most dishes were not recognizable and the fruit seemed to be sitting in a mess of flies, so we passed on dessert. There are no clocks in the rooms and when you book for two people, they put you in two twin beds shoved together. It's a good thing this wasn't our honeymoon. You get one small flat pillow per bed and our ceiling fan looked like it had been used as a guillotine at some point in the past. In this deluxe four star resort (as they bill it) you only get one towel per person, there are no wash cloths. The bathroom was not very clean and showed residue of urine on the seat. An okay night's sleep with the air clicking on and off at random. We woke up and went to breakfast, the coffee was good, the juice was not of this world (some sort of orange juice and tang mixture) The selection was varied enough....but again, the fruit was covered in flies, the bread was stale. We ordered omlettes at the omlette line and did not received the omlettes we had put together, we got someone else's. The servers are quick to take your plate but not quick to bring you a refill of beverages. Returning to our room, we hung the do not disturb sign on our door as we did not want any room service since we would only be there for the two days over the weekend. We had valuables in our room and we did not want anything disturbed. After coming back from the beach that day, our room had been completely cleaned. I was furious! I addressed this at the front desk, but the language barrier was too much to get them to understand my problem. Now, for the beach, the only saving grace for this resort. Beautiful beach, good service at the bars, lots of booze, bottled water, and the snack bar/hamburger stand gets 5 stars. The guy working in there cooks up a mean chicken burger and fries. We ate there more than anywhere else because the food was the most tolerable. The strangest thing about this resort and it's beautiful beaches, is the lack of natural wild life. There are no birds swooping down to get a stray morsel off the beach, there are no fish in the lovely shallow clean water, and thankfully there are no bugs. I thought these things were strange. We had made dinner reservations based on the front desk recommendations for El Gaucho. We arrived at 7pm for our reservation, had a glass of chilled red wine and ordered off the menu. We both ordered cesaer salad. Way too many anchovies, YUCK!!! I had the Argentinean appetizer and my husband had the beef stew. The appetizer consisted of three small slices of bread, one with a shrimp with the dirty black vein still in it, one with two tiny slices of sausage, and one with a mystery meat that was a type of blood sausage. Are you kidding me? The beef stew was a clear yellow broth with no hint of salt or flavor. We sent back the salads and the appetizers. We had ordered the fillet for dinner. What arrived was a joke. A big hunk of meat, charred to burned (we asked for medium rare) and it was not fillet mignon but some tough nasty hunk of meat, probably not beef at all. We got up and left the resturaunt with full plates on the table, they asked us if anything was wrong and we told the waitor that the food was horrible. We went and had the buffet instead. We only saw part of the entertainment from our table and it was horrible so we went back to our room. After the two days in the sun, we checked out and met our transfer operator at the front curb. We aimed our way through motorcycles and vans to pick up all the other people traveling to the airport from other hotels. At this point the bus operator gave everyone on board the speech about thanking us for traveling to Dom Rep and that when we arrived at the airport, we would be required to stay on the bus with the doors closed while the offloaded our luggage. I spoke up because this made me very uneasy. When checking in to our flights, everywhere in the world, we, as passengers, are asked if anyone has touched our luggage that we do not know. I told the Tourinter person that I was not comfortable with a stranger handling my bag while I was forced to stay on the bus. Don't worry, we wont' steal anything from you. I told him that I wasn't afraid of what would be taken out of my bag but what might be put into it. I have since wrote a letter to the Transportation Safety Administration regarding this scam at the airport. This is a very serious force protection issue and it should not be allowed to continue. So after they unload your bag, they want a tip. We took our bag and walked off. In conclusion, this 4 star resort is a flop. Go to Mexico or Puerto Rico instead and check out real service in the caribbean. This Princess is only a female frog in disguise.

<Content>They have a nice beach. Unfortunately, that's about the only good thing I have to say about it. My wife and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess for 5 nights in late Sept, 2003. When we arrived we had no hot water in our room and our 'VIP' package extras did not arrive until late the second day. The water situation got worse the second day when our shower stopped working completely. After much complaining and 2 days with no shower at all, we were finally moved into a nice ocean view room with a working shower. The upgrade was nice but didn't make up for having to constantly complain about the shower for 3 days. I can't remember how many times we heard 'it will be fixed before you get back'. I certainly didn't feel like a VIP. To top it all off, we missed our much anticipated snorkeling trip because our 6:30 am wake up call never came. This was a huge dissapointment. After all, how often do you get to the Caribbean? Getting a refund proved about as easy as getting the shower fixed. The result of all of this was that we wasted the better part of three precious days getting nowhere with our seemingly simple problems. The incompetence exhibited hotel management was maddening. It really took the luster off what could have been a great trip. We arrived back home feeling like we needed another vacation. The food was average. The spa was average. The entertainment was lousy. I will never forget those little clowns rendition of 'Old McDonald'. EE-I-EE-I-O baby!! The beach was great! I think the best ammenity in the entire place was the hamburger stand at the beach. My recommendation to you ... if your going to stay here reserve an ocean view room, bring your travel alarm and a thick skin. If you're lucky enough to have a problem free stay, I think you'll enjoy it. If not, be prepared to make the best of it. At least the booze is free.

<Content>Save your money - go to Mexico Save your money. We spent a week here in Januar and suffice it to say I'll never go back. The rooms and grounds were nicely decorated, but the staff don't seem to care about their jobs, nor do they seem to know the difference between regular and VIP packages. We paid for the latter but didn't get everything our travel brochure said we were entitled to. Nice beach, but the food is heinous. After one meal (and no alcohol or tap water was involved) I (and half the people we spoke to) was sick as a dog, and stayed that way for five of our seven days. Cleanliness is not something they take seriously, and this resort has no concept of the importance of keeping food cold enough or hot enough. Cruddy nightly entertainment, lack of hot water for baths and showers and lacklustre housekeeping. This resort appeared to be a good deal for the money, but was terrible. Do yourself a favour and go to Cuba or Mexico.

<Content>What a vacation....... This resort is out of this world, from the day we arrived to the day we left we were treated like royalty by everyone. The resort was immaculate and all the staff were very very friendly. It was that good that we did not even lurk outside the perimeters to discover the local culture. I recommend this resort to anyone, and i will certainly go again, and again and again.Wayne Notman, age 35, Plymouth

<Content>WOW Wow, we were'nt expecting much upon departure but Tropical Princess was well worth the 2,000 CAN$ for a full week for 2 adults.First of all, this is a resort that caters mainly to famillies and to that effect, they do an excellent job at keeping the youngsters happy with various activities, good food and 3 beautiful pools so when the sun goes down, the little ones get some shut-eye without too much fussing. And to us, travelling couple (we're in our early 30's) we did not have a single annoying event involving kids.Okay, now the place is squeaky-clean (and we're both very fussy about cleanliness) indoors and outdoors. Everything is beautifully decorated with bright tropical colours that enhances your mood so that you dont have much of a choice on keeping a permanent smile.Food: We're both very open when it comes to food, we eat pretty much everything so the buffet was perfect, we had a lot of choices and were always full when we left the dining room (i did gain some weight...). We made the effort to immagine ourselves being picky and difficult taste-wise and we both agreed that even if we were, they still had a lot of things to eat and you could be quite satisfied with the selection. There are some A la carte restaurants that may or may not be included in your package, the Mexican and the Dominican are excellent, the Brazillian was okay and the Chinese was really, really bad TIP: Eat slow, there's enough for everyone; dont try the Chinese food ...Beach: Wow-gorgeous-clean, enough said. TIP: Monokinis are in so guys, if you really want your girlfirend to get rid of the top dont even propose it; if she's ready and willing she'll get used to the idea herself; the more you talk to her about it, the less she'll be inclined to do it. myself i really did'nt give a hoot and after 1 day, she thought it would be cool to remove it because women from all ages do it... I was smilling for the remainder of the trip... And oh, looking is free, depending on the girlfriend/wife it might cost you a lot of grief (not my case, yeay!!! - but over ther you have the excuse that tehy are evrywhere so that you'd have to look down at the sand (and even then...) to avoid seeing them).Pools: See above and add Very clean.Bars: Very good, try the Banana Mama, excellent! Actually, the barmans usually speak limited english, french or german; so if you're picky about your drinks, i suggest learning some basic spanish. They free-pour all the drinks and i found out that 1 Dominican ounce = 2.5 Canadian ounces. TIPS: Be specific concerning what booze (= Vitamina; in Dominican Spanish) you want in your drinks because i'Ve ordered many Pina Colladas and had a different version everytime: myself i dont care, rhum is rhum and coconut and pineaple juices are, well, pretty basic in flavor but having been myself a barman, i know some people can be outright annoying when they dont have exactly the exact amounts of a specific brand and blah-blah-blah.Rooms: Wow, very clean, very confortable. TIP: if the power goes out try removing the card next to the door and pushing it bac in, it's kindaa like a master switch ( we didnt know so we spent a night without power...).Side-trips: We tried out the Bavaro Runners trip, it was a lot of fyun but might not be for everyone,; we were'nt expecting much so we enjoyed ourselves. But again, dont expect too much of it, just go with the flow and enjoy the view. TIP: bring sunscreen, bug reppelent, a hat and beach towels.Overall: A lot of German tourists that are the rough equivalent of annoying loudmouth american tourists but the ones we Okay, now what you need to bring over there:- washcloths (they dont seem to exist in the D.R.) : bring one for the airplane trip to and back, 'cause it's hot and humid so it's nice to wash your face and pits... -First aid kit: Doctors cost 120$ / consultation so bring Gravol, Immodium, Maalox, Tylenols, Ibuprofen, Band-Aids, Q-tips, Moxema hydrating lotion (sunburns) etc... -Condoms: if you go there in hopes of meeting new and exciting, bring protection ;)

<Content>Thank you message I stayed at your hotel from Oct 2nd to Oct 8th. I think the hotel was just perfect, excellent service, very good food, beautiful beach, and I will definitely go back there for my next vacations.I learned how to sail in catamaran and that was just enough to say I had an excellent vacation.I would like to thank Miguel from the Public Relations desk at the lobby and also a nice Uruguayan lady from the same desk for their support.Gardens were beautyful!Congratulations!! Truly yours, Patrick A. Stenning

<Content>A Great Week Like others, I was a little skeptical before traveling to the hotel after reading ohter peoples reviews. However, I can say that we had a great time. The hotel was rated a 5 star, although I would consider it more along the lines of a 3.5 star here in the states.The grounds, pool and beach were all beautiful. We got the VIP package so our room was about 3 minutes from the beach. I would suggest getting this package as some rooms were quite far from the beach as the resort is huge. The room was not immaculate, but very nice.We had a few minor issues during the stay but nothing that the hotel was not willing to work out very quickly. Remember, you are there for a vactation, there is no need to get completely bent out of shape if things are not perfect. The entire staff was very friendy. The key here is to tip the people that serve you and be nice. The people that work in the hotels have some of the best jobs on the island and they only make $180-$200 per month. A $1 tip may not seem like alot to you, but it means alot to them, and goes a long way to making sure that you get great service.The food was good, although not alway identifiable. And we made it through the entire trip without getting sick. That is until the trip home. All, I can say is take plenty of Immodium with you. You may need it, you may not, but it is safer to have it with you. I don't know if we got sick from the food or the drinks, but somehow we got it and it stuck around for a while. I guess thats what I get for being adventurous with my food choices.The shows were entertaining and basically something to do in the evenings besides hanging at the bar or watching TV. We went to the casino next door one night (8 game tables and 25 slot machines) and watched the show at that hotel. The Princess' shows were much better.Over all, to sum up my experience, I would say that we had a great time and would definetly go back. If you are looking for wild nightlife and non-stop action, this is not the place for you. It was very relaxing, and that was just fine with us.

<Content>You get what you pay for... My husband and I went there on second honeymoon, at the end of July. When I got there, I felt like I was in paradise, everything was beautiful. Then on the third day I was there it poured. I saw that there were families with more than one umbrella with the princess logo on it, and my husband and I were NOT given one. It poured and poured and no umbrella. There was no remote control, though I did not watch TV, the mini bar was never restocked, and I didn't get an iron after requesting one 4 times. The food was okay, but I am a pickey eater. There were seven restaurants and basically I felt like it was the same foodevrywhere. But since it is a buffet, you find something to eat. My husband loved the food. There is lots of food, EAT, basically that is all you do. The drinks were great. The entertainment was okay, not the best though...It was a good thing that I am fluent in spanish, although they try to understand you, it is still difficult...The BEACH is beautiful. I have never seen anything like that before and I have been to many resorts. The pool is okay. The staff is nice, as nice as they can be...what I tried to remember is that these people are getting paid about $6000 pesos a month, which is the equivalent to $174 US. So I don't blame them, the staff is friendly, try to tip them, it works...Our last day there was the worst, we went early to the beach and my husband lost his glasses. The freaking timeshare sales boys are sooooooooo annoying, I had to tell them to stop harrassing us, Our taxi arrived at 1pm at the hotel we called the bellhop (maletros) at 12pm, because we had a feeling that they were going to take their time... he got there at 2:30pm. The taxi waited for an hour and a half. I was sooooooooo upset, but hey I would go again, I booked the trip in SAnto Domingo for 11,990 besos, which is basically $400 USfor the both of us, for 4 days, a good deal. everything is included, the good and the bad... But remember you get what you pay for...

<Content>Truth is somewhere in the middle Having been to about a dozen islands in the Caribbean, my fiance and I know what we like and what we don't like. Before going on this last trip to Bavaro Princess, I was rather concerned by many of the reviews I read on this site and others. After coming back, I realize that 1. We don't like the Dominican Republic, 2. Both the good and bad reviews are accurate to some degree, 3. Bavaro Princess and the Dominican Republic (DR) are surely fine for some, and 4. We won't be going back to Bavaro Princess or DR. I'll try to make this as helpful as I can without being too long-winded. Language barrier? You bet.......we expected this and so we didn't let it bother us too much (we are in their country after all). My parents don't speak a lick of Spanish and they recommended DR to us, so it's not impossible to get around.....just frustrating at times. Mildew smell in the rooms? Absolutely for us......it was almost choking.....but we spoke with others as we were leaving and they had no problem and one asked to be moved because of it and was (my fault for thinking the problem would be the same in all rooms.....ask to get moved if you have a problem). Food? Really not as bad as some people say it is........no, it's not USA 4 or 5 star, but to call everything inedible is just not true.......we were actually pleasantly surprised that we found as much as we did that we liked. Seafood? OK, here you really need to listen to the reviews.....it is the exception to the food comments above........no need to gross you out, but trust me: DON'T EAT ANY SEAFOOD while there.....ANY! I was sick for a week after coming back. Rooms? Other than the smell, pretty nice but some could certainly use a freshening up.....not horrible, but not great (and this is coming from someone who knows that 5 star in the Caribbean is NOT 5 star in the US.....it's just not....sorry folks but there is no such thing as a 5 star hotel by US standards on the beach in the Caribbean........don't expect it and you won't be disappointed). Service? We were VERY happy with the service at the restaurants and our maid did a great job too. Leave a few dollars the first day and it goes a long way (extra towels the rest of your stay). Drinks? Mixed reviews......some really good, some really bad: experiment until you find what you like then stick with it. Beach? Gorgeous......really, I'm not a fan of DR, but the Beach itself is great. Snorkeling? This was disappoining to us....don't bother taking equipment....just too wavey and nothing to see. We are avid snorkelers so this really bummed us out. TV Remotes? They were out every time we asked for one. Room safe? Ours had no lock, so we just kept our luggage locked and put our money in that......no problems with theft though.........Hey, where's my watch? (just kidding). Front desk? Here's where the language barrier gets frustrating: Our overall impression of the service at this resort is that they are good at doing the norm......but it's the special requests that you just won't get taken care of. Maybe it was language, maybe it was lack of ambition, maybe it was a little of both? Oh, and check-in was terribly inefficient (and don't bother thinking about checking in early--the room won't be ready...or so they say). The shuttles? Not bad, not great....adequate. The fumes are pretty bad when you're riding it, but they don't smell up the whole resort like some people claim. I think the bigger problem here is that the resort is so large in area, that everyone in the resort really relies on the shuttles to get anywhere. All in all, it's not as bad as some people say. Don't go there with huge hopes for a perfect vacation. On the other hand, I wouldn't avoid this resort either. It's not for us, but I can see how it would be for some. We've certainly stayed at better, but to each his own.....we really like Beaches/Sandals, but you read some people's reviews and you'd swear they were the worst places on earth....no place will please everyone. For us, we also prefer more of an islandy no worries kind of atmosphere, and DR gave us more of a third world country feeling. I just prefer the steel drums and island culture of the other caribbean islands (eg Jamaica, Antigua, St. Lucia, Caymans, Virgin Islands, etc) over the spanish/dominican flavor of Punta Cana. Hey, my parents (mid 50's) still swear by DR (they stayed at one of the Iberostars), but it's just not my cup of tea. I wouldn't blame that on THIS resort though. Don't let the reviews scare you, and dont let the reviews build up your hopes too high that you're setting yourself up for disappointment. The truth is almost always somewhere in the middle. Be prepared and remember when things aren't perfect that you are on vacation and that should mean relaxing. Have Fun!

<Content>Don't be scared off by bad reviews!! My family and I visited the Bavaro Princess over the week of 4th of July. The hotel was beautiful, we had 3 seperate rooms all of which were huge. All the rooms had a bar area, couch, king bed and very nice bathroom. The rooms look just like the pictures. We were very worried after reading the reviews and maybe a little cautious. We used good sense, we did not eat anything that looked like it had been sitting out awhile and did not drink the water, but we all had a wonderful time. We knew to aske for safe keys and remote controls from reading the other reviews, they were out of romote controls at the front desk when we arrived but after seeing the hotel and the beach we realized we would not be watching tv at all anyway. We did bring our own wash-cloths which was helpful. We also brought little gifts for our maid and left them out everyday (dollar store items-toothpaste/brush, hair accesories, childrens toys, etc.) and our room was made up daily with fresh hibiscus flowers and towels shaped like swans. We locked all valuables in the safe any time we left the room. BE careful-the door locks behind you when you walk out so either carry a key with you all the time or open the lock when sitting on the porch (2 of us got locked out of our rooms-one in the middle of the night!). The grounds of the hotel seemed very safe, there were security personnel walking around all the time. I am female and young (27)and did not feel uncomfortable walking around by myself. I would not recommend walking around outside the hotel by yourself, this country is still very poor and has a different feel than ours. We tried to make our reservations for dinner before we had breakfast and that worked well (I recommend breakfast at the Chopin, it was not as crowded as the other).We made an effort to use spanish which was very helpful (between the 4 of us we know about 30 words of spanish but it was helpful). No, the majority of the staff does not speak any english, but keep in mind you are traveling to another country and it always helps to learn a little about the place you travel to. We have traveled throughout europe and mexico and this was the most we had to rely on our skills rather than others with regard to communication.We did not go to the shopping center outside the hotel but walked to the next town which was well worth it (Facing the ocean walk right about 15-20minutes). This town was far cheaper than the vendors on the beach (we priced a vendor's painting on the beach to the left of the hotel and he wanted USD 450.00 and we got the same painting in the little town to the right for USD 40.00 (not a typo--$40.00!!).My husband and I took a bus into the city closest by the hotel which I do not recommend. The city was very dirty and we walked around in circles while being begged by children who want to show you around for a fee. One child did not speak any english but kept pointing to his feet that were bare so we bought him a pair of shoes from a store only to see the same child 2 hours later with a different pair of shoes and another set of americans!!! We ventured out on our own all over mexico and had great experiences, we both agreed after visiting this town that Punta Cana is better to just relax and enjoy the resort.Please ignore the bad reviews unless you are a stuffy american. When traveling to a foriegn country you have to open your mind and understand that it is not afterall, America. We would go back anytime and would recommend it to others. For the price it is well worth it.

<Content>Nightmare from Beginning to end! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess in Punta Cana May 2003 for 6 nights. It was a disaster from the moment we got off the plane. My passport was switched with someone else's (I didn't realize this until I got to the hotel and they asked to see my passport at check in----so be very CAREFUL when the airport checks your passport, they rush and I never thought to look at the picture when the man handed it back to me). We then waited 45 minutes on the bus at the airport while the man came to collect our transfer tickets to get to the hotel. Once we got to the hotel, they placed us in the wrong room (2 twin beds) we also purchased the VIP which we didn't have (our refrigerator was not stocked). Once we complained to the front desk, NOTHING WAS EVER DONE. We couldn't even get reservations for dinner that night or the next night. Why we purchased the VIP package, I still don't know. Our trip was based on making trips to and from the front desk (a pretty far walk since the hotel property is HUGE....too big actually). You have to take shuttle buses around the resort which was a joke. Half the time the buses were packed and you would have to wait for another one and shockingly that one would be packed also. The only nice thing I can say about Punta Cana is the beaches were absolutely beautiful. I would highly suggest staying at another resort though. There was not much of a night-life at this resort. Nobody spoke English and the food was horrible. Whatever we ate went right through us...my boyfriend was stuck in the room an entire day with bad stomach pains (if you know what i mean). So be careful with what you eat and drink there. We had eventually gotten our room switched after the 3rd night. Than when it was time to check out we got charged a massive amount of miscellaneous charges from our other room. Charges such as phone calls (we never used the phone) snacks taken from the mini bar (which we only took what we were allowed to take with the VIP Package). Even the check out was a hassle....over 30 minutes arguing. We settled on paying maybe 50.00 US Dollars just to leave the hotel, we were tired of arguing. Nobody really understood us anyway. So the vacation turned out to be a disaster, but we tried our best to enjoy what we could and took advantage of the beach and pool.....and drinks!! Enjoy!

<Content>Pretty good I recently went to the Bavaro Princess with my 13 year-old daughter and my wife. The fauna was absolutely BEAUTIFUL, as was the beach, where we spent most of our time (go early to get seats in the shade!). Having it all-inclusive is a definite advantage, and not having to carry money around made it really feel like a vacation. The room was ok; value was reasonable for the Caribbean, and the wildlife made it a very interesting stay. There was always something new to see and do here. Entertainment was great, although the nightlife started a little too late for me! Restaurants and buffets were WONDERFUL! Because many French people go there, there were many topless people on the beach, which was a bit of shock to my daughter, but we soon got used to it. My one major complaint is the not-so-great service; the language barrier could be a problem, although I know some Spanish, and service was on Caribbean standard time-- soon can mean anywhere between 30 mins and 4 hours. Overall, a wonderful experience!

<Content>Loved the Bavaro Princess Our Trip To Punta Cana Was Fantastic. Try to ignore the negative reviews. The hotel was great. The people are freindly, the grounds are absolutely beautifulL, the food was very good, and the beach is spectacular. I have also travelled to other parts of the carribbean but Dominican is clearly a different and wonderful experience. The people there mainly speak spanish. We communicated very well with them actually. It is nice if you try to speak in their language, I found that they appreciated it more since you are in their country. The music (MERENGE) is also great and they promote it like it's their religion. One thing to remember is to TIP! These people don't make a lot of money and once you leave them a few dollars either USD OR PESOS it's greatly appreciated and they will give you extra stuff i.e. the cleaning lady will give you more towels or drinks for your mini bar. The grounds are beautiful and constantly maintained. The selection of restaurants is also nice to have. The BELLA PASTA restaurant is very good. The suites were clean and very spacious. All in all the trip was FANTASTIC AND I RECOMMEND THE PRINCESS HOTEL!

<Content>I had a good holiday My husband and I were at the Princess for March break. We had the VIP package. This package enabled us to book our dinner reservations by phone and not have to wait in line. Our rooms were clean although looked like they needed renovations soon. I loved the balconie. The grounds are beautiful but are huge. We often walked to restaurants but also used the train. We loved the pool area and all the lush vegetation and the little bar on the ocean. I found the food fine. You have to remember we are in a 3rd world country and north american 5 star standards to not equate to 5 star Dominican. The staff at the front desk are rude. The VIP check in was supposed to be fast. It was the slowest. We also didn't get robes but I didn't ask for them. The man booking the messages was also rude. The staff in the restaurants and at the bars are very friendly, work very hard and always have a smile. The Licey is an excellent restaurant. Yes my lobster was dry but so what.The service was excellent and a very pleasant experience. I really enjoyed the evening.I tipped as soon as we arrived small amounts but on a regular basis. I tipped most of the staff we came in contact with. I didn't tip the front desk or the man booking the messages because the were rude. The airport was a horror show when leaving. Hot ... no seats. I enjoyed my holiday and would go back.

<Content>Time of our Lives 5 very satisfied ladies in their 20s went in JulyWe just got back from Punta Cana we stayed at the Bavaro Princess and we had a blast!!!! The resort was huge the beach was to die for, the pool was at the best temperature all the time..the grounds were beautiful and well maintained, maid service was finethe food was great.. the people were awesome!! however member services and front desk werent all that helpful we had to go to the main desk and spoke with management to get our questions answered and bath towels that were not left.. but hey we were on vacation we were not going let that bother usIve read past reviews before I left and I got quite nervous because I read all negative reviews. I have no idea what these people have been talking aboutif they are not satisfied with this type of package including the food they should really consider joining a vacation company where they choose what to eat and when to eat and clean the units themselves and bring their own towels. YOU MAKE YOUR OWN VACATION!! People should realize that they are not at homeand that the people there can only do so much to make sure everyone is completely satisfied.We would like to send a special thanks to; Lehandro, Alfredo, Oscar, Carlos, Rafael for the daily entertainment.. Julian Ceasor and Ruban at the pool bar who served the best drinks..all the wonderful ladies that kept up with the pool and beach aerobics.. and to all the people who entertained us at night with the great shows. We also took the vip package and it wasnt bad at alltheir beer was a little gassy but the secret is to stir it when you get it to let out the most of the gas but of course I learned that on the plane back to Toronto, how convenient huh? We didnt need all those beers and pops in our roomswe were happy with water. If we needed drinks we would get them at the bars, we didnt have time to drink in our rooms as we were never there except to shower, change and sleep. Other reviews have said to ask for the converter??...when we went they gave us the converter however it did not workand we asked around to other people we met that were on the plane with us and theirs did not work either but why would you need a converterdo you honestly think you will stay in your room to watch TV??? There is ALWAYS something to dowe did it the old fashioned way..we got up changed the channel found a show and left it on that channel and got ready for dinner. We also got the key to the safe the next day which was no problem we just locked up one of our luggages for the day. Who ever gave negative reviews on the Lacey restaurant must be losing some marbles, because we were there and it was fantastic. after every meal (plate) they took our knifes and forks and brought us CLEAN ONES!! NOW THATS SERVICE!! A note to any teeny boopers who are into clubbing this resort is pretty quiet, if you are going to party it up then you should think about going else where. I did A LOT of relaxingits not Cancun or Acapulco there was one bar on site and a disco outside the resort and it played mostly salsa and meringue and the bachata. Over all I give the resort and entertainment and amenities a fully 5 star. would I go back?Im planning on going in January. The CorVics, P.S if you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

<Content>Bavaro Princess Nightmare Prior to leaving for the Bavaro Princess, my family and relatives that joined us on the trip were looking through the reviews at several of the vacation sites, and many of these reviews were far from positive. I figured that people writing these reviews were rich snobs and had way to high expectations for the resort. Knowing that it is a five star resort, I could not believe that this resort was as bad as it was said to be.After a moderately long 6 hour flight from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada to Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, we could rest assure that we were bound for a week of relaxation and indulgence into what was supposed to be a five star resort. Arriving at the gates of the resort, was like arriving at the gates of heaven, with lush gardens, and magnificent floral arrangements and massive palm trees. As we stepped off the bus we walked into the grass-hut-style-entrance-way were there was a bar, travel agent representatives, stores, a nice pond with turtles and fish, and of course the check-in.Here is where things became interesting. When my parents purchased the holiday package, we purchased the VIP package, which included all international drinks, two bathrobes per room, free massage, newly renovated rooms that were supposed to be ocean-view, several passes to the a la carte restaurants and to the gourmet restaurant The Licey. Our first wrinkle in our vacation started when we were not given ocean side rooms, which we were okay with. However, what really turned us off was how we did not get rooms remotely close to our relatives, which was arranged through our travel agent that called the resort and specifically asked for. We went to our rooms via golf cart train which was nice to have as the resort was very large. I tried to remain positive after the discussion with the front desk staff, but was again immediately disgusted as we passed through what seemed to be a sewage management site, where the aroma of raw sewage filled the air. Finally we got to our rooms, whice coincidentally smelt like sewage as well.We asked for another room, and we were told that we could not have one and that we would have to wait for a few days. Finally, we were given another room after three days. The rooms were okay, but had several problems, with them. My perfectionist personality was not satisfied, as the rooms were not cleaned very well, like how the bidet constantly became dirtier and no one was using it. We soon learned that, tips of five dollars American, plus candies, and other gifts were enough to get our floors swept.Now to get to what was the worst about the resortThe food. Dining at Bavaro Princess was like being on Fear Factor food challenges. The Buffets were interesting with the varieties of cheese, lunchmeats, and interesting seafood. The Bavaro Princess has truly mastered to art of blood sausage as they have managed to incorporate it into as many meals as possible. I must say that the al Carte restaurants had amazing service, but lacked in the food department. We went to the Licey on my cousins birthday. The food leading up to the main entr茅e was satisfactory. As we came into the Dominican Republic as a group of eight, many of us ordered what was called the Princess Lobster, it was a combination of pineapple and curry on a grilled lobster. On first inspection of the lobster, it looked like it was diseased, and first taste tasted like it was diseased. The strength of the curry was enough to choke, and the pineapple did not help. My advice on choosing at The Licey would be the steak or the veal chops, both were actually very good. Breakfast was a constant disappointment, as blood sausage was once again in the mix. My suggestion is eat the yogurt, fruit breads but stay very far away from the omelets or the eggs, as they are extremely undercooked. El Pescadour was my favorite restaurant it was a seafood restaurant, which was flawless, the lobster there was excellent, and everything else was fantastic. The Brazilian steak house was all right. My only suggestion would be to stay very far away from the Brazilian bread, as there is again blood sausage on toast. The Italian restaurant, which I believe was called Bella Pasta, was a terrible disappointment, from raw veal, to the Princess pizza, which included slices of hot dogs, and yes more blood sausage, not only was a weird combination but also was inedible as it smelt like a hockey bag full of very used equipment. The other restaurant, El Gaucho I believe it was called, was another seafood restaurant but in a buffet style. Everything was actually so revolting I stuck with bread and ice cream. I urge you to do the same as there are flies eating the same thing you are for whom knows how long. Finally the snack house and the bars. The hot dogs at the snack house were deep fried, which I found to be very unusual, the fries there were also very undercooked and saturated from the oil. The Bars would serve adults first and then children, I once stood in line while several adults would so kindly cut in front of me.Speed of service was incredibly slow as we almost missed our flight because the bellhop took 2 hours to get 2 bags.The entertainment was also brutal, as a clown would stand on stage and scream at everyone in Spanish while children would be following him. After the childrens show was over we would watch people dance around and lisping the 70s music, with what looked like an elementary school play.Some other highlights of our trip were swimming next to someones feces in the pool and spotting used tampons on the pathways. Also beware, that there are countless topless women, and men in G-Strings, if you have children that you do not want to be exposed to this, or find it offensive, find another resort!Although the resort was mediocre, and the food was terrible, we managed to have a good time and can laugh about how bad it was there. Oh and by the way, bring lots of money because imported food is very expensive there. I would suggest bringing some of your own food, too. If I were to go back there, I would pack an electric frying pan and bring a weeks worth of food in a coolerNo Joke!I would strongly recommend not booking a trip at this resort regardless of whatever your travel agent tells you. If you are from North America, you will be strongly disappointed.

<Content>Great Holiday I have just come back from a trip to the Dominican Republic with two girlie friends. We stayed at the Bavaro Princess hotel, and had the most amazing time. We spent most of the holiday at the resort, as it was so nice, we didn't feel any need to go elsewhere. The staff were great (really friendly and willing to help out all the time), not many spoke good english, but we were able to muddle through with a mixture of Spanish and English (after all we were visiting their country and culture - why should we expect them to speak English if we don't try). Our room was spacious and airy, and cleaned expertly every day ( the maid left fresh flowers every day). The gardens were beautiful with many birds such as peacocks and chickens wandering around. The gardeners were excellent, ours cracked open coconuts for us whilst we sat on our balcony. Food was good and there was lots of choice at all of the six restaurants (and the queues weren't too bad for reservations). The pool was lovely and refreshing, and the pool bar a great addition. We spent most of our time on the beach as it was beautiful, and not too crowded, especially if you got there early. All in all, it was a great holiday, and excellent value for money (it cost roughly the same as a weeks package holiday in Greece once you have taken into account spending money). The only downsides i can think of, are the length of the flight in cramped economy, and the fact that most of the people on holiday were part of a couple, and we were three single girls. If you have any comments or questions, please drop me an email.

<Content>Do not go if you can only speak english I would just like to share this with anyone interested in visiting the Bavaro Princess Resort. Please read everyone's reviews as you will probably see similarities in the problems. My fiance and I just returned a few days ago from this resort from only visiting for a week. We came back even more stressed and un-relaxed, as we were among arrival. The country itself is amazing and the grounds of the hotel are nice enough. Problems, there were many but all in all I say it is definately not worth the price we paid. We arrived at 11:00 in the morning and were not allowed our room until 3 in the afternoon which is fair enough because of the housekeeping. So walking around the resort was a bit of a pain since it was so big. We had to follow a map to get anywhere and they didn't tell us about the trolleys going around, so after about a day or two of walking everywhere, and getting fed up we finally asked about the trolleys and discovered they were free to ride and it stops at every bus stop. On the first day I had lost my watch on the pool side, which in all fairness was my own mistake, but trying to find a lost and found was ridiculous. The front desk sent us to public relations (who was on the phone and not impressed in helping us what-so-ever) then she sent us to the bell boys who sent us to public relations again who sent us to the front desk. Too much of a hassle.. We were doing the running around in all cases. The smoke detector was above our fan so our safety was not important to them at all. If there was a fire, we wouldn't have known any better. The licey restaurant looks nice, but there is a charge. What they don't tell you prior to vacationing is that you must wear long pants AND a collared shirt hence why we did not visit this restaurant.. Mac Princess did not have any snacks at all. Just drinks.. The Hispaniola was the only restaurant we ate in which had great food and gread variety. The breakfast was not impressive there, the lunch was ok, but too much hot food for the afternoon, and they do al. Dinner was amazing, food selection was great, the waiter/waitress never let your drink empty, they were refilling continuously. The beach was great, a lot of beach beds so never a problem with that. The room service was excellent, sometimes they came early and then in the late afternoon. The air conditioner was awesome. The bell boy service on the day of leaving was awful we called for our bags to be picked up and they didn't show up for 1/2 an hour so we trucked them back ourselves... The room service was very nicely presented, and nicely served but the food wasn't that good. Our mini fridge was not restocked at all, so we had to buy our own drinks at the nearby store to bring back to the room. You couldn't bring them from the bars since the glasses were so small and the bars were quite far from the room that you would've drinken them on the way back to the room anyways. Entertainment was only spoken in spanish and french and the occasional word was in english but since they speak so quickly it's hard to understand what they are saying anyways. The day entertainment was unknown. The only thing we saw was water aerobics which unfortunately is not a preference of my boyfriend and myself. Some of the staff tried quite hard to understand you, but the other 3/4 of the staff could care less. My boyfriend and I did get sick 2 out of the 7 days there, I don't know what from though. The market outside of the hotel was an experience all on it's own. They spoke better english than anyone in the actual hotel. The people are very nice when they first meet you, but if you don't want to buy then you are considered or even called cheap or stiff *** or so I was called, being 19 years of age, this is not appreciated and if you have children with you I suggest you watch out. The prices asked in the hotel are ridiculous, go to the market which is a 3 minute walk and they will offer it to you for the same price but you can get them down 50-70% of what they are asking. I have long hair.. at the hotel it 15 U.S. The pool was not cleaned at all throughout the stay, so after 4 days we couldn't go in anymore... bring a first aid travel kit if you can... lots of little problems on it's own but it's good to have. Bring things to do like games/cards/books etc cuz you may get bored.. Just be prepared. Talk to your travel agent.. If you are going by signature be careful. Our rep was very nice BUT she didn't show up one day that she said she was going to be there and the next day she was 20 minutes late. Considering she was only there twice our whole trip, we lucked out on the day trips. Manati Park is supposed to be a huge tourist location, so if going please be careful... You can walk around the park in an hour and they do not take care of the animals there. Please pay attention to these things, these are few if you would like more information or any questions answered please don't hesitate to email me my address again in thyme18@hotmail.com. Enjoy!!

<Content>Great Vacation I must say that I do not understand why so many people complained about this resort. Okay I admit I to am very, very picky but you know what I LOVED BAVARO PRINCESS. I was so scared b/c of the reviews but people you are on vacation. All I can say is that this was a wonderful resort the staff are very nice and please TIP.... although tips are included in all inclusives this is not true these people never see a cent . I gave everyone a 2 dollar tip in US money and boy they really appreciated it. I loved the grounds the beach o goodness it was the best in the area the activities were okay but overall i would recommend this RESORT to anyone. And hey I made friends which we will keep in tough with each other. So all I can say is Keep and open mind and treat others as you would want them to treat you. I saw many french people who I can say are very rude :-(,,,, I met some people from Canada who where sweet and Puerto Rican's who where also sweet and of course the Dominican folks who I will miss where also sweet to us.Just go and have fun and lay out and enjoy your stay there are more positive things about the resort. Hey I came back with a nice tan. So do not forget your sunblock.O'yeah i have never seen so many ugly boobs in my life Ha,ha,ha as I have there .. E' Yuck there beaches are topless and goodness if you are going to go topless please make sure the boobs are purky and not down to your knees. And I saw some hairy underarms also ha,ha,ha.. I tell you some people have no shame but hey it was worth my many laughs...

<Content>Certainly not 5* We went there last year - it was OK, the beach was beautiful. Unfortunately, I agree with the negative reviews - while we were lucky not to be charged for things we did not use, and nothing was stolen from us, the rooms were horrible - mildew smell, disappearing towels, sewage problems, etc. I hated the food - everything was so greasy, even pastas were soaked in oil. Entertainment is weak (the disco was closed for some reason). There was a constant sewage leak by the pool, and nobody was really doing anything about it. Go to PUnta Cana, but to a different resort - for this price, I am sure you will be able to find an alternative.

<Content>On a scale of 1 to 10 - a 12!! I have traveled to every continent and seen many different resorts and all kinds of hotels. My wife was in the tour operating business for five years, so I think I can add an objective review to this forum. Most of the time you get what you pay for. This time what I got exceeded my expectations. Let me explain why.What I have learned from traveling is that if you really don't want to be someplace there is always something to complain about, and if you want people to go the extra mile for you, here's a concept - TIP. In case you did not notice, outside the resort people live in highly impoverished conditions, they work long hours and hardly get any vacation time. $1 to us is nothing but to them its 25 pesos - keep that in mind. We just got back from a seven-night vacation and were blown away by the attention and amount of fun we had. I had reservations to play golf at two different courses and to go scuba diving but cancelled them since I was more than entertained at this resort. Even though our vacation started out like a nightmare things quickly turned around.Upon arrival to the airport we learned that our luggage (5 bags for 4 people) never boarded the plane with us. Upon arrival to the hotel my daughter lost her backpack with her game boy, my son and myself lost our sunglasses. We had to go buy bathing suits and basics since we did not know if our stuff would ever show up. I paid a kid who worked their $10 to help find my things and deal with the people at the airport. The next morning everything including the shades and backpack appeared one item at a time, and everything was intact. Turns out the backpack was left on the bus, the luggage was still in the US and my shades were left at the restaurant table. The people at the hotel seemed to bend over backwards to help us.I can see how some people can complain about the food, but here's a little secret - it's a f...n buffet, how good can it possibly get. Pick your foods and you won't be disappointed. That is precisely why besideand seafood. If you wan't good wine, steak or fish, don't get it from the buffet. You're in the Caribbean so do as them. The fruit is phenomenal so are the vegetables, and for those with a decent palette, there is caviar, decent champagne, great assortment of fine cheeses and cold cuts, olives, etc... If you want egg mcmuffin, with watered down coffee for breakfast and chicken nuggets with onion rings for dinner then stay home. Another tip, for an extra $100 at the time of booking you can upgrade to VIP, I highly recommend it. Our room was fabulous, always clean, no bugs, nothing negative to say. We were walking distance to the pool and beach and were only in the room to bathe and sleep. The wine sucks but the rum is phenomenal. Besides with the orange armband I had access to anything at the bar I wanted included Remy cognac, fine liquor, etc... Definitely worth the extra cash.Activities kept me busy all day. Lying around is not for me since I'm a type A all the way so I spent a great deal of my time playing soccer, volley, water polo, swimming, jogging, eating and drinking. The shows at night are not exactly Vegas but they do put a great deal of effort into them and for the informal atmosphere around the shows they were more than OK. The kids loved their kid shows every night although at first they were scared of the stage. Out of the seven nights we were there the only show that really sucked was the variety show on Monday Night. Still 6 out of 7 is not bad.The grounds are beautiful and the beach is great too. Vacations are what you make of them. I'm sure if the hotel was that bad I would not have stayed all day there but would have ventured outside and played my golf, scuba-dived, swam with dolphins etc... Anyone can have a bad day at any time when everything seems to go wrong for you. Such was our first day there. But you have to put a little effort into getting the most out of a trip wherever it may be and not expect everyone to kiss your *** all day for nothing. Remember thi

<Content>Nothing to worry about if you go to the Bavaro Princess What are all the complaints about? We were getting concerned about this trip based on other reviews but had a wonderful time with our two boys, ages 4  7 1/2. We went with another family who also had a 7 1/2 year old boy. We had the VIP package which was well worth it. The room was great and kept very clean by our maid who showed up every morning before lunch. The beach and grounds are beautiful  the hotel staff was very helpful. Many of them spoke English and those who did not, made the effort to communicate. The food wasn't great but none of us starved, even my picky son found plenty to eat. None of us got sick nor did we meet anyone who got sick, don't eat the cheese, meat or mayonaise salads that have been sitting out on the buffets and you will be fine. The whole reservation deal for the restaurants is annoying, however, it is easier with the VIP package and every other all-inclusive we've ever been to also require reservations at the restaurants. The Kid's club was disappointing, the hours were very skimpy and the activities were unimaginative and redundant. However for the couple of hours a day, the kids went and were fine. The pool ran out of towels too quickly but we hardly needed our towels anyway, lay them in the sun for an hour and they dry! As for the trams, yes they are smelly but walking around is so pleasant we hardly used them. We would certainly return but only with another family because of the poor kids' club. We do recommend this hotel.

<Content>Spectacular grounds...Fabulous vacation! Our group of twelve (2 families) all had a wonderful time! Glad that the negative reviews didn't scare us off from this wonderful resort! I had no complaints and was extremely pleased with most everything about this resort but can say that the food was so-so, with the exception of a few really good meals. We didn't starve! VIP package was worth it and everything I expected it to be. My advice, be considerate and make an attempt at learning some words in the language of the country that YOU have chosen to visit. People will only be as friendly to you as you are to them! If you have unrealistic expectations, you will not be satisifed anywhere. Only miserable people have miserable vacations!

<Content>Wouldn't go back, but good enough for an affordable all-inclusive. My girlfriend and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from April 6-13. I wouldn't tell anyone not to go to Punta Cana, but I wouldn't go back either. The beaches were great and the weather was wonderful. Remember, the beach is on the Atlantic Ocean, not the Caribbean Sea, so it is not as calm and clear as some other islands. The weather was always sunny and around 90 degrees. We tried to keep our complaints minimal and tried to enjoy ourselves. However, there were some things that bothered us. 1) Even though my girlfriend and I paid for the VIP package, we did not receive a room close to the beach. Not really a big deal. We were actually closer to the restaurants and lobby 2) When we got to our room, we were given two twin beds. When we called the front desk to ask for 1 king size bed, they hung up on us. We decided to keep the room because it would have been more stressful to try to switch rooms. 3) Our AC leaked. The maid reported it and someone fixed it right away. 4) T.V was fuzzy. *You have to ask the front desk for a remote* People complained that the rooms did not have a remote...just had to ask for it. 5) All motorized vehicles burned oil/diesel and polluted the air. After riding the tram, you smelled like oil and gasoline. We tried to walk anyway, it was good exercise. 6) My girlfriend and I were sitting on our balcony and they decided to spray for mosquitos without notice. We jumped up and ran into our rooms before being enveloped by the smoke. 7) They had a sewage treatment facility on site and some areas of the resort smelled like raw sewage 8) Be careful of what you eat and drink. They claim they use filtered water when cooking, but it still gave us stomach problems. Be sure to bring Pepto or the like. 9) Went to the markets off the resort. The sales people are very aggressive and try to rip you off. Don't even waste your time going there. They get mad at you if you offer lower prices in return. It's o.k. for them to rip you off, but not o.k. for you to try to get a better price. - My advess well and they will definitely remember to take better care of you during your stay. Also, always try to say gracias/thank you and the people respect you more if you try to speak Spanish. Even if you don't speak it well, they like to see you try to speak their language. Tipping: bartenders, wait staff, cook at the beach grill/snack bar, maids, etc. You would be amazed at how far $2 goes when tipping.

<Content>Wow! another week in paradise! What are all the complaints we are reading about this absolutlely beautiful resort? We just got back from there on Apr.11, 2003 for the 2nd year in a row. We went on the vip package and it is well worth it. the review from New Haven Ct. also went on the vip package and obviously did not know how to take advantage of it. the vip package allowed you to make reservations for all of the restaurants directly from the phone in your room;no lineups;the bathroom had a special clothesline near the tub to hang all wet clothes;we phoned home collect from one of the three telephones in the lobby by just paying $1 U.S. at the counter; no problem.You also could get a tv remote just by asking for it in the lobby; and the tv worked great with it and lots of channel selections.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful to us especially if you tried to speak a little Spanish (after all this is a Spanish speaking country).In two years now we have never seen any insects in our room at all; the rooms were kept very clean and spotless. The Spa was outstanding with lots of the newest workout machines, tons of free weights, two hot tubs, a sauna and a place for massages. The staff there was very helpful to us showing us how to operate the machines.We have been to many different resorts all over the Caribbean and this is definitley our favourite..in our books this is a 5 star!I think it is a case of attitude when you go away, if you like to complain you will always find something to gripe about. The grounds are so beautiful and the beach so spectacular , the 7 restaurants offering lots of choice, the pool fabulous ;more palapas available on the beach than any resort that we saw..We will be going back nest year for the 3rd year in a row.

<Content>I loved it! My friend and i stayed at bavaro princess in january. We absolutely loved it! We are both seventeen so i wanted to write this so that teenagers would actually have an idea of wether or not theyll have fun. Personally, this was the most amazing trip ive been on. Everyone was so friendly, staff ,people. The animation team is wonderful andi miss everyone so much (espesh Alfredo and Carmen) The food is different...but not at all bad. It takes some time getting used to though. The drinks are good lol (most exciting part for us) We met alot of people there who we still keep in touch with. The shows are ok, and the disco is really fun (starts at midnight) ! I had fun takign the tropical dance lessons and playing volleyball at the beach e veryday. Im going back in june and cant wait.

<Content>Welcome to Hell The entire trip was a disaster short and sweet:#1)Staff was rude, did not go out of their way to help and clearly disliked Americans.#2) A/C and TV barely worked and mini-bar was not refilled.#3) Alcohol was bottom shelf and food was average at best.#4) Nearly impossible to make reservations at Restaurants, which were half empty when we walked by.#5) Shuttle buses are souped up Golf Carts, drivers are rude - one made us chase him to the bus stop and then just took off as we got there.#6) No ATM on site - have to use one in Town.#7) Takes 4Ever to get served.#8) Management does not care about guests' feelings, language barrier exists and although management and staff do speak English, they refuse.#9) Signed up for Speed Boat and Snorkeling - waited 2 hours past meeting time - Bus NEVER showed up, our $ was refunded next day.#10) Shuttle to Casino barely ran, had to walk - not exactly safe - @ night.#11) No Entertainment on sight - NONE!! #12) WOKEN UP AT 9AM EVERY MORNING W/ KNOCKING ON THE DOOR, DESPITE DO NOT DISTURB SIGN.Lastly, place is a joke, Beach is great, other than that wouldn't stay there for free.

<Content>Worst Vacation Ever My fiancee and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from April 8 through the 13th. Having just gotten engaged I was hoping for an enjoyable vacation. Upon arrival, a day late due to the snow, we were told that there was not a room for us, and were told rather rudely. After contacting our travel agent and having them contact Bavaro it seems that Bavaro overlooked a confirmed fax from our agent had sent informing them that we would be a day late. Luckily they just happened to find a room that 5 minutes earlier didnt exist. Our first complaint is that maybe 2 PEOPLE SPEAK ENGLISH on the entire staff. Every peice of food is fried in soy bean oil and it takes its toll on your stomach after a day or 2. We were left in a sweltering hot room for approximately 3 hours without electricity, four calls later and alot of sweat we finally got someone to fix it. Couldn't get an explanation in english though. The staff was was very rude, the VIP package is a joke and isnt worth $5. There are only 5 ocean veiw rooms so dont fall for that. I must say that the grounds were beautiful. But that is the only impressive thing. We had ants all over our room on a daily basis. When we called the front desk and they heard us talking english they just hung up on us. The entire situation was very frustrating. The enitire place was filled with rude french travelers. The lines at the bars and at the buffets were not worth the 30 minute wait, the 30 minute included massage with the VIP package lasted 15 minutes and I could have gotten a better massage from the jets in the pool. OVERALL, STAY AWAY FROM THE BAVARO PRINCESS IF YOU ARE AMERICAN!

<Content>Relax Had a great time. Yes, some do not speak english well but they tried or found someone who did. Remember, YOU travelled to a foreign country so deal with it. All of the complaints are from whiners. We noticed very little english spoken at this resort (employees and guests). Grounds are beautiful. It takes 10 minutes to walk from the main lobby to the beach (others said 15-20). WHO CARES? You're on holidays and they have little buses if you want a ride. The food was good, the rooms were clean with very nice balconies. The beach is the best we have been at. We had the VIP package and everything was provided as promised. I guess the whole point of this review is RELAX. This is a big resort. There will be the odd line. Just take it easy and enjoy your holiday. If you did not enjoy this resort you are either way too uptight or just a person that spends too much time complaining. I would send friends there with some helpful hints to make their stay even better.

<Content>Not a 5 star hotel! Don't drink the water and watch what you eat! Long lines, not user friendly. Grounds were beautiful. Staff indicated they did not speak much english but by the end of our stay I suspected that's how they got away with the poor service. My husband and I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. We had a VIP package that really didn't include anything that was special. We could not get reservations (after standing in line for over an hr) to any of the restaurants. We had to eat at the buffet. The food was very disappointing. Several in our group were very sick. We were told several time no beef three days? We didn't know what was going on until it was almost time to leave. I believe most of this was because of a so called language barrier. It took us two nights to get extra pillows. No irons in the rooms. Our neighbor finally received an iron, ironed one outfit. They went to eat. When they came back the iron was gone. There were no hooks to hook your wet things. The airconditioner was loud and my husband complained of an unpleasant smell. Our room was clean. Sheets and towels were clean. We received new towels every day. We had no remote and the tv was all snow. There was no coffee pot in the room and no ice to be found anywhere. It was very hard to get cold things to drink without having frozen bar drinks. I tried several times to call home and could not. We did not leave the resort. I was able to call home only at the airport before we left. Not sure why it was so hard in the hotel and easy at the airport. My husband and I enjoyed the weather and the beaches. It snowed in CT while we were gone. I was surprised this was considered a 5 star resort. I am planning another trip to the islands with a girlfriend and I will be very careful selecting another 5 star hotel.

<Content>Hated it! This resort (if you can call it that) was horrible. Upon arrival only two clerks were checking in a swarm of new arrivals. The line was unbearable. Next our rooms, smelled of mold and mildew and every night we spend some time killing all the bugs before we went to sleep. Spiders crawled on the ceilings, waterbugs guarded the bathroom, and the area on top of our bed was swarming with tiny ants. The TV had no remote and barely worked (unless you like snow and a rolling picture on your screen). And you can forget about simple luxuries such as robes, an iron or clean sheets. The beach towels bled their color onto our clothing once wet (they were NAVY). The food was barely edible (we lived on doritos and cheetos from the gift shop). At the spa (nothing to brag about) we were asked to share a towel! And last but not least, the staff was poorly trained, rude and very unaccomodating. Upon speaking to others vacationers there, I got the exact same feedback, proving once and for all, the feeling was mutal all around, made even more obvious by upset guests. On a positive note, the pool and beach were beautiful, but if that's what you're looking for you can find it somewhere where you can be pampered as well. This was not a 5 star resort.

<Content>The vacation from Hell Look, I don't want to seem like all we did was complain to these people, but that was just about the only thing my child, my wife and me could do about his hotels behavoir. We strongly do not recomend this hotel to anyone! We arrived around 6 p.m. at the hotel and arrived at our room at 6:30 p.m. to find people still there, not fully packed, and the room was a mess. The hotel was making extra money by allowing guests to stay later for a price, even though we were due in at about 4:30- 5:00. We called to the front desk for a maid three times, before one came. We were upset because we were tired, hot, and hungry and it looked like we couldnt relax or have a clean room for awhile.We went to the front desk and told them that one woman wouldnt be able to clean, since it was so filthy and asked if they had another room available. The assistant manager said I was arguing with him, when there was no argument, just a complaint about service. Another worker behind the desk offered us another room. We said we will eat first and then look at the room, and leave our luggage in the first room. The asst. manager said he understood and would do that. The restaurant and front desk are 25 feet away from each other. When we came back our luggage was at the front desk. The asst. manager said, Oh, so you are going to another hotel? He was being arrogant. I reminded him of our conversation. He laughed. We went to see the other room. There in the bathtub we found a huge dead roach. I told the bell boy to get the roach. I left the bathroom, he went in. My daughter went to see the roach and saw him put it in his pocket. He came out and said there was no roach. We were so tired we stayed in that room with the musty smell and noisey air conditioner ``` at this supposedly five star hotel. We had something stolen from our room, filled out a security report and nothing was evr done about it. In fact they said that we lost our belongings, not that it was stolen out of the room. We spent the whole vacation defending ohe asst. manager said- Why do you expect us to pay for something that you lost. My wife jumped out of her chair and approached the desk. She said our items were in the locked room and where taken. They treated us like we were lying. He said, laughing, If the items were stolen why didnt you call the police. Go ahead call the police. He knew we were leaving shortly. He said why didnt you go to the manager. I said because you told me to fill out a report with security and wait. Also, I was waiting for an important fax to come in, I notified the front desk of the fact, I gave them my name as it appears on the fax and my artistic name. The fax was sitting there for two days. I missed the appointment, and the opportunity.Also, every single day they charged us for the mini bar, we never took anything from the bar, just used it to keep our water cold which was free bottled water from the outside bars . We even told them to lock it, we didnt want it. One worker behind the desk said they do it to everyone just ignore it, they see childrens clothes and shoes they charge candy . They finally wrote off everything but one bottle of Evian. It was stressful to constantly go through one problem after the other and being called a liar. The asst. manager acted like he was doing us a favor by taking off the mini bar bill. They had such a terrible attitude.The transportation from the main house to the rooms, restaurants, shops in the large complex, that looked like golf carts, burned diesel fuel, or at least smelled like it, made us sick every day. Not like in Puerto Rico where they run on electric. They said that all water sports were included but didnt mention they only had 5 boogie boards and you could only have it for an hour and if you didnt return it in time a charge would be billed to your room, also the catamaran had to be back in half an hour. Beer bottles were allowed in the main pool where we swam and we constantly were watching to see if anybody broke any bottles in the pool. . Also there were some people who wereol the mans girlfriend put her breast in his mouth and said he needed to be breast fed not bottle fed. So we reminded them that they were in public, we had an 11 year old daughter there, and there were other children there, and could they go back to the room and continue. All in all it was a terrible experience and we got the feeling they did not like Americans. We have traveled in many countries and have never been treated like this.P.S.: We have read everyone elses comments about this hotel and we don't think that some people should be talking about other people's ordeals like that. These comments are just trying to tell others about their horrible or excellent experience at Barvado Princess.God Bless All

<Content>Food poisoning week We really liked the resort, the way its spread out. It is very romantic at night, with the walks along the path. We ate at the sea food resturant El Pescadores and the next day we were throwing up and having the runs. A week later and we are still having the runs and are sick and tired. I will never go there again and will never take the chance and bring my young kids there. I would not wish my kids or any other kids to get food poisoning. Your trip would be no fun at all.

<Content>Caution from Bavaro Princess  I am writing this letter to inform you of the Terrible Vacation we just experienced in the BAVARO PRINCESS resort in Punta-Cana Dominican Republic. We were very unfortunate to book a week in the Bavaro Princess resort. We booked the so-called 'VIP Package'. We were told that with the VIP Package we will be getting a Newly Renovated suite, Closest to the Ocean, Bath Robes in the room, Beach Towels in the Room, Mini Bar restocked daily with Premium Drinks, Gourmet Dinner at the Licey Restaurant and so much more. Here is what we got: 1.The room was NOT renovated, it was in a terrible shape, the bed sheets were dirty, and so were the Pillow cases and the closet shelves. My daughter had to lay her own clothes on the pillows to be able to sleep on it and my wife had to lay our own towels on the bed to be able to sleep on it. We had to lay our shopping bags on the closet shelves before we could put our clothes on it. We were bitten in our beds by bugs all night. My bed was broken and was never fixed for the whole week. We had cockroaches in the room. We had bugs all over the bathroom. 2.The room we were given was not close to the Beach it was third row with no sight of the beach at all, let alone 'Closest'! 3.We had to complain for days until they got us the Bathrobes and the Beach Towels in the room. 4.The only drinks they gave us in the mini bar were two bottles of water, two cans of Coke and Two Cans of Seven Up. All the rest of the Drinks were for extra charge including the simple Juice bottles. So much for VIP Premium Drinks! 5. There was never enough pressure in the showers, we had to shower on a drip by drip every evening. 6.We had booked the VIP Package for my whole family, yet when we arrived, they forced us to pay $15.00 US Dollars for my daughter in order to let her eat in the Licey Restaurant. 7.The food in the Restaurant and specifically in the Buffet Restaurant was so dirty that I picked flies from my own food plate at least three times. We could not even touch the deserts in the buffet as we could see with our own eyes flies that are resting in peace in the big plates. 8.Our daughter got sick for a whole day in her stomach from the food and the drinks. She was throwing up and had Diarrhea, so did lots of other kids and adults all around us. 9.The Transportation Buses were in a very deteriorated shape, it was very noisy, it could hardly move and it was polluting the environment all around, let alone that in most cases they were very crowded that we had to wait for a long time to be able to find enough space for the four of us. 10.We were promised with the VIP Package to have reserved spots on the Beach but it did NOT exist. 11.For a whole week, we specifically asked for the Hotel Manager, they refused to let us meet with the Hotel Manager, they even refused to give us his or her name.

<Content>The Dominican Republics Resort of the good, the bad and the ugly Bavaro Princess The Dominican Republics Resort of the good, the bad and the ugly First off, I have reviewed all the comments on the site, and of course vacationed at the Bavaro Princess. And, yes, we have stayed in Puerto Plata as well. So I feel I qualify to add to the comments here.I, including my wife and friends have travelled to many places on vacation and this is the first time that I felt compelled to write about a place that needs these types of reviews. As for the others who have written, I am tempted to comment on all of them, just for the sake of clarification. However, the nice part about this is that everyone is entitled to their opinions, so here is mine. Incidentally, in all of the reviews, no one was 100% satisfied. Would we go back? NO. Would we recommend it? Read on. The Check in was extremely slow. For about 60 people there was 3 staff. One was working, the other was lost walking around behind the counter, the third was talking on the phone and would use any excuse to answer it to avoid finishing the check in of the visitor. As for Check out, be prepared to be charged for things you did not use. You had to argue very hard to get the charges removed. The Grounds Spectacular very beautiful, nicely laid out. The Rooms the fun starts here. Room lay out very nice. Air conditioning seemed to make more noise than the jet engines on our plane. Rooms were musty, regardless as to how high you ran the system. No comfort zone, you either freeze to get out the humidity or you suffered with the mustiness at a lower setting. Thats not all caused by climate. We had no hot water for 3 days, after numerous complaints to the front desk. Water pressure was low, I have seen worse. We woke to a choking smell of sewer, where upon we slept outside on the chairs in bed sheets. Staff told us that at 4:00 am in the morning what do expect us to do for you at this time of the morning? They sent a service person that had to hold his nose while checking out the room. Only after he called them an hour later did they offer to move us. The next night at 6:00 pm they moved us. And, only because we were on the V.I.P package. Do not waste your money on this one. We had our room key, used to keep the air on taken almost everyday by the staff. When approached they denied taking the key. It suddenly appeared from one when I insisted she remain until security arrived. We had a THEFT from our room of our phone card, someone took the numbered code and either sold it or used it on a cell phone(someone in the area) so we were able to find out. For the rest of the week we felt violated. There was evidence of the staff going through our personal belongings. I left things in a certain ways only to find upon my return that they had been disturbed and searched through. We were always requesting towels to shower or wash with. They would take them when cleaning and not return them. As for bugs and lizards we were lucky, only a few biting insects, my wifes legs have numerous bites take spray with you. However, if you were one of the unfortunate ones with a room with mould, this is the place. In these rooms the mould was everywhere, it was ugly, and it was bad. We spoke to 3 different people, we were lucky. The resort did nothing about it no matter how you complained.The Food, for the most part buffet was buffet; it was not the greatest compared to other places we have stayed at. Meat selection was scary, especially since everything was grilled except at the Gaucho restaurant. Choice appeared extensive but as you looked closer it was limited. We are not fussy eaters and accept the local food openly, I ate pasta for 3 nights until our reservations kicked in. As for the Chopin, the entertainment on the water was great, the beef (well put it this way, my sandal could have been more tender). The cook smiled as he attempted to cut a piece for us with his sharp knife, you should of been there to see me attempt cutting it with my table knife. We found the other restaurants on the plus side for the food, when dining out at night. ).The Staff was very friendly and helpful, except for the front desk and especially the girl from hell who booked your restaurants at night. The animation staff were great, Marqurita especially. As for you cheap people out there tipping is expected. Take a look around you on the way to the hotel and you will see the conditions these people go home to. Try living on 350 pesos a month.As for the manager, Jonas R. de Widt, you could tell by his mannerism that he was shell shocked from all the complaints. I am still in communication with him regarding our theft. If you wish to give them a copy of your passport they will give all the help you wish...I ask you! do you feel comfortable giving them your passport to copy...no me. When I asked him to accept their own country's visitors card of which we pay for, he was unable to give me an answer as to its acceptance for the resort...scary isn't it. In summary you cannot beat the beaches in Punta Cana; you can however do better than the Bavaro Princess Resort as this is definitely not a 5 star resort. We have and will always go with the flow when we travel, however keep in mind when we do pay for a service we are only asking we get what we pay for, in the Bavaro Princess's case we came up short.

<Content>Terrible Service, inconsiderate staff If you have never been in a 5 star all-inclusive resort before, you may think that there is nothing wrong with this place. However it is the worst place I have been to and I have seen a lot. Although resort grounds are absolutely spectacular, staff is rude and absolutely indifferent to you and you will have to scream and argue to get anything done. Room service is dysfunctional and we got bed sheets changed only once in 7 days. Food is horrible and everyone in our group got sick. Management refuses to do anything to help you and is a cause of all problems. I only described some of my bad experiences in Bavaro Princess and you can contact me to find out more. There much better places to go. Stay away from that place.

<Content>We loved this resort My wife and I, plus our 5-year-old son, stayed at the Bavaro Princess for two weeks in February. We had a great time. Some of the very negative reviews we saw after making our reservation last November had me overly concerned about the choice we had made but, in hindsight, I'm so happy we did not change our plans. If you arrive looking for a good time at a spacious resort on a beautiful beach, you will not be disappointed; if you arrive looking for everything to be the same as you have at home (food, language, personalities, etc.), perhaps you should be staying at home. The room is exactly what you would expect from a resort like this. The food ranged from okay to excellent, depending on the meal, and we never had a single problem with upset stomach. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Although some of them did struggle with English, they are way better at English than I am at Spanish so who am I to complain? The grounds were unbelievably nice, well-maintained, and huge. If you don't like to walk, this might not be a good resort for you. All in all, we would definitely recommend this resort.

<Content>Fantastic holiday Feb. 21/03 We just got back from our first vacation in twenty five years without our kids and had a ball. We went with two couples and we all loved the resort.The people who gave the resort a bad review need to get a life. Sure the food is a little different (but good) and there is a bit of a language barrier, but give your head a shake, you're in a foreign country. A lot of the staff could speak enough english to communicate and the ones who couldn't tried real hard. We didn't encounter one staff member who wasn't helpfull. We found trying to communicate with the non-english staff to be fun. A tip to anyone that didn't find the staff helpful and pleasant; I discovered years ago that people will treat you the same way that you treat them. The pool and beach were beautiful and the weather was 85-90 degrees. We'd go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>Most relaxing vacation yet My husband and I just returned from this resort and had one of the best vacations we've ever had. We travel somewhere south almost every year and would highly recommend this as a destination. We also had the VIP program - always had a restocked fridge, beds turned down every night, cleaned daily and fresh towels. We sat on the beach every day and not once did we have a problem getting a chair - any time of the day. Food wasn't to bad - between all of the restaurants there was always something good to eat. Staff were friendly and helpful - a little bit of a language barrier a couple of times but we at least attempted to learn some of their language, which helps. I would certainly recommend this resort and would even consider returning next year.
