<Content>Impressive Hotel Having stayed at many different hotels in Boston, including Hilton, Sheraton and Hyatt, I can honestly say that the Radisson holds it own against all of them. The rooms are crisp and clean. Bathrooms are a good size and completely remodeled and look great. The room carpeting and wallpaper are all new and clean. Outside hallways are spotless and elevators are fast. The hotel has installed Sleep Number beds which can take a bit of getting used to and you will either like them or dislike them. If you book your room on the east end of the hotel you will have the best city view of any hotel in Boston. Also make sure you don鈥檛 get a room that鈥檚 adjoining to another room. We were at first put in one of those rooms and all was fine until the 鈥渘eighbors鈥?moved in. They were extremely loud people and we could hear every word coming from the door including their arguments and dinner reservations, etc. They became so annoying that I went to the front desk and asked to be moved. I was promptly moved to a room that didn鈥檛 have the adjoining door and it was very quiet and well insulated. The best thing the hotel has going for it is it鈥檚 staff. All are very friendly and respond quickly to any issue. From Pre-arrival emails to switching rooms to my departure I was very impressed with the staff. They are currently remodeling their pool and work out area as both are closed for a few months. When this is complete, this hotel will be even better. We booked a bed, breakfast and parking package at a great rate. I highly recommend this as many hotels are charging $40 a night to park now. The breakfast buffet was good at the Theater Caf茅 with very friendly staff. It was great way to fill up before walking the city. All in all, this hotel is a great value for your money.

<Content>Quite nice Just got back from a one-night stay there. Great location -- within easy walking distance from Boston Common and Quincy Market. We had a very nice large room on one of the top floors. Breakfast was nothing special, a bit overpriced, but, all in all, a very good experience with the hotel.

<Content>Great location, good price I stayed there for 4 nights with my wife in Nov 2008. Had a great time. It is one of the best locations you can find in Boston. Eating joints are conveniently located, so we didnt get a chance to try the in house dining. The room was on the top floor and had a beautiful view of downtown. Neither the airport nor Cambridge were more than 5 miles away. In short - we accomplished a lot by just walking around.

<Content>Good Value Just got back from a girlfriend getaway stay at the Radisson this weekend. Although the Radisson is not the most high end hotel in Boston it really is a great value. I did a lot of research for hotels in Boston prior to selecting the Radisson and it was the most economical for what you get. Rooms were clean, check in was friendly  professional and the location is VERY good. We were able to walk to Newbury Street and the Prudential Center with relative ease. There are also some good restaurants very close to this hotel. I noticed that there were a lot of other girlfriend getaway groups staying and even a bunch of guy friend getaway groups too. The only complaint I have is with breakfast, which we only had on Saturday morning. If you order off of the menu be prepared to wait an inordinate amount of time for a simple meal. I'd suggest getting the buffet instead.... it's a much better meal and deal anyway.

<Content>Great place to stay in Boston Just got back from 3 nights in Boston at the Radisson. Loved it! The hotel wasn't super fancy, but nice. Our room was BEAUTIFULLY clean everyday. Really exceptionally clean I would say. I was on a high floor with a great view of the city. Personally the balcony was a little scarey for me but that's my problem. Because I was attending a conference in a different hotel, I didn't have much contact with the staff but what I did have was friendly. The location was super!! good restaurants of a variety of cuisines all in the immediate area. Right in the theatre district. Just a couple blocks to Boston Common. A leisurely stroll to the Quincy market area (maybe 20 minutes very relaxed pace). I grabbed a sandwich from the cafe. It was fine. Also had the breakfast buffet one morning. It was good but not spectacular. I would have liked it a lot better had it been included (apparently they have a bed and breakfast deal I missed) rather than full price ( I think it was like $17). And I paid way less for my room than what I see here as average room price. I'll definitely stay here next time.

<Content>Good experience Stayed here with a conference, and had a very nice experience. The location was great, the concierge was fabulous. We walked three blocks to the Freedom trail, and were also near a subway stop and Boston Common. The hotel was in the Theater District, so when the baseball game was rained out, we were able to get last minute tix to the Blue Man Group a block from the hotel.The room was nice as well, and clean. The bed was great, we had fun playing with the sleep numbers.I was happy with the price of the hotel, booking at the conference rate, but would have questioned the price if we'd had to pay full rate. Enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Great rooms, great stay! We found this hotel to be ideal for our family. Since there are five of us, including 3 teenagers, we need two rooms when we travel, which can get pricey. We were given a terrific rate on both rooms and got adjoining rooms high up with a really great view of the city. We were impressed with the Sleep Number beds, the amount of room we had, and the cleanliness...a nice surprise. A great find in the heart of the Theatre District of Boston - within walking distance to everything. Only glitch: my husband misheard the woman at check-in advise him of our free breakfast.....we went to the cafe inside the hotel that she'd suggested, had a light meal from their buffet, and were presented with a check for over $70!! We asked at the front desk about having that discounted, since we weren't expecting that expense and since it was SOO high, but since we'd gotten a great deal on our rooms, they weren't able to reduce the charges. Oh, well. But we did love the hotel and the location and would definitely seek it out again!

<Content>Good location, disappointing exterior Given the close poximity of a number of stylish hotels in the same price category the Radisson should aim for a better first impression by doing something about the terrible facade, sprucing up its entrance and remodelling its drab lobby which looks like a 70s Holiday Inn.The room was adequate, the bathroom was in mint condition, and the beds were perfect - the best beds we have slept in ever.The balcony had not been cleaned in ages, but since the views were nothing to write home about anyway, that did not really matter, but somehow compounded the bad impression you have from the start when arriving at this hotel.

<Content>Good Hotel - Great Location! I stayed for business and the conference I attended was on the 6th floor of the hotel so that is the main reason I chose this property. I stayed 9/16 to 9/18 at a rate of $239 plus taxes which was the conference block rate. I was very pleased with the room. It was average size on the 20th floor with a great view. The beds were comfortable (sleep number adjustable beds) and the furnishing were relatively modern. The bathroom looked nice although not that big. They leave a USA Today paper outside your door each morning. My main complaints with the room was no mini fridge and no soap dish/shelf in the shower so you had to bend down to grab your soap and shampoo. The outside of the hotel is not glamorous, nor is the lobby but that really didn't concern me. The pool was average size and they had a decent fitness center with a couple of treadmills and a couple of cross trainers both with personal color tvs. There are no weight machines and no free weights with the exception of a few dumbbells. The main thing that is great about this hotel is the location. You are right in the middle of the theater district and 2 blocks from Chinatown. Fanheuil Hall is about a 15 minute walk. Boston Common is a five minute walk and the closest T stop is the Boylston stop which is also 5 minutes from the hotel. One block away across the street is City Place which has a food court which includes Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks and Cold Stone along with some chain restaurants like PF Changs and Rock Bottom. Legal Seafoods is across the street (great seafood!!!) and McCormick and Schmicks is a block away which has great happy hour FOOD specials (be warned the alcohol is grossly overpriced - $5.25 for a Coors Light draft)Would stay here again in the future for pleasure if could get a better rate. I've heard that people have booked for less than $200 per night and I'd say if you can find that, it is a great deal.

<Content>Good Location in Boston Stay: Aug 2008. Rate $170+taxes see below.Location: within easy walking distance (even with a wheelie case and aged 70!) from the MBTA T-system Boylston St station. (Get a Charlie-Card from Logan Airport-much cheaper and more interesting than a taxi-even arriving at 21:00 hrs.)Welcome friendly and cheerful. Dining-room staff cheerful and helpful.Good buffet breakfast but with sufficient choice for variation over three days; a la carte also available (but we had inclusive package via Internet booking). If you like two TVs on different channels and a simultaneous view of the traffic at Stuart St / Charles St crossing, sit at the natural-light end of the dining room鈥攐r on the terrace for traffic noise only; otherwise have greater peace in the other half of the room.Room on 22 Floor. Clean, some traffic noise (over-looked the road crossing; we had asked for a room not facing the road!-so minus points for this)鈥攂ut used earplugs. Surprisingly we found no fridge. Plenty of space for moving about and clothes storage. Huge bed (UK Super King/US King) with the option to change the hard-/softness of the mattress on the left and right sides independently.Free internet use in reception / lobby. Helpful local advice centre in lobby area. UK and other non-US visitors beware of prices: those quoted are without taxes (it tells you this) but the taxes are: State 5.7%, City 4%, CCF 2.75%, so you need to add 12.45% to the stated room price and allow for the normal US tipping expectations. If you want a hotel in the centre, without paying for luxuries you will not use (our usual choice), then this will meet your needs.The hotel is near enough for you to buy food from a market and then watch bats flying as you have an evening picnic on Boston Common just one block away. Not perfect but a good choice, we鈥檇 choose it again.

<Content>Great Location for Seeing the Sights I stayed in the Radisson Hotel Boston the weekend of 9/12-14/2008. The location is great. It's just a couple blocks from the subway station, which is also very easy to navigate. The room we had was on the 19th floor and very nice and spacious w/ a balcony that overlooked part of the city. The concierge was extremely helpful with directions and handed us printed directions to our destinations. It rained most of the time we were there and the doorman handed us umbrellas on our way out every time. The value was great because I used my Radisson Points (10,000 each night for a total of 20,000) and got a discounted room rate of $135/nt. This hotel was running above $330/nt so this was a bargin! I would highly suggest staying here. The service makes all the difference!

<Content>Superb Location, Nice Rooms I picked this hotel based on good reviews and a reasonable price (under $200) for Labor Day Weekend. I was not disappointed and would stay here again in a heartbeat. We had a room on the 23rd floor with a balcony and view of the Prudential Center. The room was extremely spacious and very clean. There are numerous eateries to choose from across the street- Legal Seafoods, Maggianos, McCormick  Schmick, RockBottom, Bennigans. For a quick breakfast, Au Bon Pain, Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks. There is a 7-11 one block away. The Boston Common, T stop  shops on Newbury street are about a block  a half away. It is in the heart of the Theatre district.Pluses:Location, Location, LocationSleep number bedsGreat deep tub for soaking and rain shower headIn room safeFabulous housekeepingHelpful bellmenMinusesElevators could use some cleaningExpensive parkingPricey in hotel restaurant

<Content>Good Time in Boston We stayed at the Radisson, near the Common. This was a pretty good location, close to a Trolley Stop  not too far to walk to the Pru Center. We arrived a little early at 1:30pm but were able to check into our rooms. We were two couples  wanted to be in rooms on the same floor with a good view. The reception agent (not very friendly  almot rude) advised us that there was only one room availabe to meet that request. so we ended up on a lower floor. The room itself was fine - we enjoyed the Sleep Number beds - kept very clean. The maid, however, did not discard the water from the melted ice in the bucket for two days. Breakfast in the restuarant was OK except for the LONG wait for our food that we ordered off the menu vs. choosing the buffet. The Consierge was NOT helpful at all. I called down to the desk for help with a dinner reservation. He was obviously busy with other guests and asked if he could call me back in my room which he NEVER did. I ended up making the calls myself. Overall, Boston is a great place to visit. We had some great meals at Fleming's (steak house), Top of the Hub and Artu (Italian) in the North End. Even though we're Yankee fans, the tour of Fenway was good. Try to make plans ahead for the Duck Tour as it was sold out on the day we wanted to go.

<Content>COMFY but with Construction Views My Husband  I along with our 2 month old stayed at the Radisson for 4 nights Aug 8-11 2008. We flew in and arrived at 11 AM without reservations and were so surprised that we could not only have a room with a high floor (23rd) but that we could go ahead and check in and have our room at 11 AM. The lady who checked us in was very pleasant. The bellhop was very courteous and he even gave us lunch and dinner recommendations as he walked our luggage up for us. It was such a nice treat to be able to take a nap while our baby did right when we got there. The room was very nice and clean and large enough for the 3 of us. We got a king room on the 23rd floor, but were a bit dissapointed that our gorgeous view was of large construction of a high rise building directly in front of the hotel. They started early too, like at 7 am banging, although it was a distant sound. It was still a sound not all pleasant to the ears. The linens on the bed were very comfy with the down. The maids were very generous and gave us PLENTY of towels and washcloths. With a 2 month old, we needed them! The maids arrived promplty between 10 and 11 am and this worked out perfect for us as we were always leaving at that time. One thing that was a dissapointment was there IS NO FRIDGE OR MICROWAVE. Which I'm sure is a reason to drum up business in the hotel bar and restaraunt, but a bit of a shock as most hotels of this stature have them, their food should speak for itself right? We never ate at the restaraunt as it seemed a bit overpriced by the looks of the food. We usually always try out the hotel restaraunts but didn't want to this time for that reason. However Legal Seafood is directly across the street and also the California pizza kitchen and another mediteranian restaraunt across the breezeway that was to die for! The concierge should recieve a RAISE-- he was EXCELLENT he booked us everyday with something! We went to Cape Cod, booked Dinner reservations, Booked taxi's-- He tooked care of everything and really made us love our vacation! He also recommended his favorite lunch place--The Intermintent Tavern--GREAT!!!! They had awesome food-- not much of a place from the looks, but you must GO!! the food was lovely. THANK YOU!!One thing that was unnacceptable though was the business center--only had 2 computers--in which teenagers who had walked in off the street were using to play solitare  get on myspace. I had to print out our boarding passes on the morning of our flight and I had to get the concierge to help me with it. That was VERY nice of him. I think the business center should be monitered by room key if you ask me!For the Money this was an awesome place to stay, but next time well make sure we have a fridge and microwave--as with a baby we sure would have had an easier stay, especially storing milk.

<Content>The Ideal Place To Stay In Boston! Located in the heart of Boston, this Radisson hotel is an above average hotel. An attentive, friendly and professional staff greet you in the welcoming lobby. We were taken to our room which was big,spotlessly clean and furnished as advertised with a Sleep Number Bed. OMG! Just the bed was reason enough to love this place! We had our own private balcony with a gorgeous view of central Boston.There are tons of restaurants in the area, access to public transportation, Boston Common and Boston Public Garden are only 2 blocks away. If you need directions or trolley tickets, it is all available at the front desk. Excellent value for your money if you don't count the insane price they charge you for parking. It is my only complaint. They should be ashamed of themselves charging 33 dollars a day to park your car! There are many public lots close by that charge much less so be forewarned.

<Content>Great Location, Loved the Hotel Our family stayed in this hotel from July 28-August 3, 2008. We picked this hotel because they let you reserve a room on their website with 5 people in a room, because of the reasonable price and because of the great location, in the theater district, near the parks and subway. We had 2 adults and 3 children, one of them in a crib. I checked the hotel rates a week before we left at the Radisson website and got an even cheaper rate with no cancellation penalty. We paid an average of just under $200 a night.The room was average size with a balcony, we had room 2007 on the 20th floor, with a wonderful view of the Back Bay skyline and the John Hancock building. The room was very quiet when the balcony sliding door was closed. The bathrooms were pristine and clean, looked like brand new tile and fixtures, the shower was the rainfall type shower head, wonderful.The bellmen and concierge were helpful with everything from finding a drugstore and a cab to finding a screwdriver so we could change batteries in a toy. Our toilet had a problem one day and a building engineer was in our room within 5 minutes and had it fixed in 10 minutes.The other reviews were accurate in describing the nearby food court and 7-11 convenience store, both in the adjacent block. We were only a few blocks from China Town as well. I recommend Legal Seafood across the street as well as Finale, an outstanding dessert restaurant in the Boston Park Plaza Hotel building 2 blocks away. Also in the nearby City Place food court is the Gray Line office, from which we booked BeanTown Trolley Tours and a Gray Line All-day Cape Cod Tour. The Radisson is a stop on the BeanTown Trolley, as is City Place, another convenience.

<Content>Nice Overnight Stay I arrived at noon for a one night stay at the Radisson. I was pleasantly surprised to find they had a room available. Check-in was quick and cordial. I got to my room on the 9th floor and found it as it should be- clean, up-to-date and comfortable. The view was of the indoor pool and treadmills in the fitness center on the floor below. The bathroom was large enough, with the sink inside the bathroom, however, there was only an inch between the door and the toilet. I found that odd, since the bathroom was large enough- it's the placement that was off. The bed was comfortable. The room was spacious. There were two easy chairs and a table, in addition to the desk, two beds, and chest with a TV. There was a coffee pot with coffee, but no refrigerator or mini bar.I locked myself out of the room and handbag in. Security came immediately and let me in, then checked my ID to make sure I wasn't going into someone else's room. He was serious about the id, looking at it carefully. In the morning the elevators were terribly slow. Management needs to put in a service elevator as clearly a major part of the problem was room service and housekeeping taking up a huge amount of space in the elevators. Going down, then back up, there were two waiters with large trays, one person with an enormous laundry cart, and one woman in a Radisson desk uniform pushing past others to get on the crowded elevators. Shouldn't happen. The morning elevators were my only complaint about the hotel. I had to wait with a dozen or more people for more than five minutes for an elevator.The hotel is located across the street from a small food court that included a California Pizza Kitchen, a Dunkin Donuts, as well as about 10 other restaurants/fast food places. The hotel had a restaurant, but I did not use it. Their menu prices were quite reasonable for Boston.  It was a 7 minute walk to Boylston T station.

<Content>Beds Are Amazing Just returned from the Raddison, Boston. As stated the outside of the hotel really lets it down because the hotel is excellent.Our room 1701 had a living area, two televisions, two balconies and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on (stayed at Hiltons and Burj). The staff are some of the friendliest and welcoming staff I've encountered. The Gym is small but adequate and I enjoyed a lovely swim in the pool. They also have a terrace to sunbathe on if you so wish.The bar is very good for a quick drink before you hit the bars and superb restaurants in Boston (Legal Seafoods across the road serves the best dressed lobster in the world).All in all a wonderful stay in a wonderful city.

<Content>Average Hotel We stayed 3 nights at the Radisson Hotel Boston on Stewart Street. It was an average hotel. Not a lot of frills. It was a short, 4-5 block walk to the closest green T line, which made getting around the city convenient. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and average size. Two adults and 2 children had lots of room. It did not have a refrigerator, which was a disappointment. The pool was cool, but the kids enjoyed it anyway. There was no spa for them to warm up. They had a small exercise room, next to the pool. Radisson states they are a green enviornment friendly hotel, but the housekeeping staff did not seem to understand what that means. I tried to use our towels for 3 nights, but every evening there were fresh towels for us to use, despite following their instructions to reuse them.Overall I would stay there again if we were traveling to Boston. The hotel was convenient, staff were helpful and the room rates were reasonable, compared to other downtown hotels.

<Content>Loved the Radisson We spent 4 nights in the Radisson in early June. Originally we thought the hotel was in Cambridge so were delighted when we realised our mistake, and were actually right down-town.The lobby may not be too snazzy but do not let appearances fool you. The room was huge with a separate lounge area with a 2nd huge TV. The bathroom was very modern with all the trappings you would expect from a four star.Bed was extremly comfortable and the views of down-town Boston from both balconies was really amazing !!I cannot fault this hotel on anything...we did not eat here so cannot comment on the food...location was excellent and all staff extremly helpful.When we visit Boston again we will return to the Radisson.

<Content>Main thing the room was a delight... the lobby less so I stayed at the Radisson for 6 nights and enjoyed my room very much. The free internet access is a great asset and the friendly staff is most certainly even more so. I had some disagreement concerning room billing and the personnel was most forthcoming. Two things bothered me: the hotel atmosphere is the culmination of anonymity. Lobby practically nonexistent and you felt sort of out of place even sitting down waiting for a colleague. .. I would have enjoyed a drink/piano bar.. . Furthermore the outside of the buliding resembles the lobby atmosphere.... more like a multiple story parking house with elevators carrying the cars to the different floors with not a living soul around..... :-).It is well situated in the downtown area.... I had a balcony overlooking beautiful Boston from the 21st floor but the balcony is in no way a place to put an armchair and enjoy the view .Nevertheless: to cut a long story short: go for it.

<Content>Great hotel Good location. 15 minute walk from Back Bay Station. Lovely area with lots of good restaurants and bars.15 minute walk to nearest subway station but most atttractions within walking distance. Asked for room with view and were given large room on top floor with great view and balcony. Big comfy bed and usual amenities. Reasonable swimming pool and v small gym- nice to relax after busy day walking! Good restaurants nearby- definitely recomment Legal Seafoods- just across road. Fantastic meal.

<Content>Great Location! The Radisson is a nice place to stay. It was blocks away from the Boston Common (start of the Freedom Trail) and the subway station. This isn't the nicest place I've ever stayed, but for the price and the location, I would definitely recommend it! The breakfast at the hotel's restaurant (not complimentary) was wonderful. Be sure to try it!

<Content>Great Hotel for the Money We stayed at the Raddison last week and absolutely loved it. We were going to a Red Sox game and decided to book something in Boston for the night through Priceline. We got a great rate of $89.00 on priceline and were so lucky because with the NBA finals in town there were no hotel rooms to be found. Our room was on the 18th floor and had a nice view. I thought the rooms were great. They were pretty large compared to some of the rooms in the city, and it was very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the location was perfect. I would recommend this hotel to both families as well as couples and business people. It is ten times better than the Park Plaza which is another 3 star hotel in the same area!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Just an average hotel the low ceilings in the lobby and shabby elevators kind of spoiled this hotel; the rooms are small but comfortable and the staff was helpful for the most part. There was no free wireless internet and the workout room was a joke, however I got directions to a health club on Boylston street which was nice. The location is good- however I would rather stay at one of the hotels near Copley place.

<Content>Great Stay in Boston Booked this hotel through Priceline.com. Had never used it before so I was a bit worried, but turned out great. We paid $125 a night instead of the $300+ standard rate. Hotel doesn't look that impressive from the outside but is newly renovated on the inside. Right from check-in the staff couldn't have been nicer and were extremely professional and courteous. Shout out to John H. the daytime concierge, he was extremely nice and helped us with the trolly tour. The rooms were very nice. We were on the 16th floor and had no issues with noise from the street. There is a bit of construction going on next door, but we had no issues with it and actually enjoyed watching the crane at work!The room had 2 queen size sleep number beds - they were quite comfortable and the kids had fun pressing the buttons and making the mattress go up and down! The bathroom was very bright and modern and extremely clean. The rest of the hotel was very clean also.The kids had fun in the pool, however, not the most impressive pool I've every seen and I decided not to take a dip myself. Could use some work. Nice sun deck attached though.The location of the hotel is great. Only 1 block or so to the T and Boston Common. Plenty of restaurants, shopping, etc. in the area.We had a great time in Boston and would have no hesitation in booking this hotel again.

<Content>Beautiful Room, Great Location This hotel has very beautiful rooms. The outside of the hotel is very ordinary so it surprises you on how lovely the rooms are. The room we stayed in had two queen sized Sleep Number beds and down comforters. The sheets were soft and everything was sparkling clean. The hotel is located one block from the Boston Common and about five blocks from the start of the Freedom Trail. Starbucks, CPK and Legal Seafood is right across the street. My only complaint is the pool. The water was cloudy, the tiles around the edge were filthy and paint was peeling off in places. It was pretty awful. There is a small fitness room and a sundeck on the roof, which is very nice.I would stay here again.

<Content>Decent hotel...great location...but avoid the breakfast deal/ scam! We recently stayed for 3 nights on a family trip to Boston. The rooms were newly renovated, clean and comfortable. When making my reservation I opted for the $15 daily breakfast coupon (by paying $10 extra a night)...that was a mistake...when we visited the hotel cafe we found the breakfast prices to be VERY high...$16 for the breakfast buffet...and about $10 for every entree...so breakfast for a family of 5 would have been big bucks...so much for the $5 savings with the breakfast coupon. When I attempted to return the coupons and insist on a refund of the $10 a day, the front desk gave me a very hard time...after a bit of an argument, they issued the begrudgingly refund...call it a coincidence, but that night we received a surprise 3:30am wake up call....clearly a little revenge from the front desk staff....we promptly unplugged all our phones as to avoid any further mistakes by our pals at the front desk!!! Besides this little issue, the hotel was clean, reasonably prices and well located. MANY great restaurants within walking distance...

<Content>Mediocre hotel in great location We took a chance and booked this on Hotwire for a weekend trip to Fenway. The location was great- close to the T, and yet walkable to bars/restaurants/etc. But...the room had ants. The sliding glass door was so thin that we could hear all the construction (they start early!) next door, and the street noise from a club next door was a little much at 2 a.m... this coming from a room on the 24th floor. I dont know if its louder down by the street.Would I stay there again? If there was a deal. If I found a better deal somewhere else, I would go there.

<Content>Great!!!!!!!! Sept, 2007 my wife and I stayed three nights at the Radisson while in town to sight see and attend a Pats game. The location of the hotel is ideal and is walking distance to everything i.e Boston Commons, Faniuel Hall, Back Bay Shopping, etc. The hotel itself was as impressive as its location. The rooms were a good size and the king size sleep number bed was very comfortable. The staff were also very helpful. We arrived very early (9 am) and were provided with our room. Initlally our room was situated next to the elevator and was a little too noisey for me. The front desk staff provided me with another key to a room to see if it was more to my liking. It was! Great view, great layout, great bathroom. Also, John, the concierge, was without a doubt the best in the business. Very helpful!We're heading to Boston again in May/08 but unfortunatley the rate for the hotel was too expensive for us. We paid $209/night back in Sept. I wish more subscribers would add in what they paid so that readers would have a good idea on what to expect and where to find the best deals. Boston can be a very expensive to stay.

<Content>Good points, bad points We stayed here for three nights with our teenage sons. We had two rooms;one overlooked the building site and downtown to a shabbier part of the city, the other had better views of the city although there was a lot of street noise on Saturday night. Good points: the rooms are immaculate and the bathrooms are spotlessly clean; the staff are efficient ( if not particularly friendly); Starbucks ( for breakfast) and Legal Seafoods (the best seafood restaurant I've been to) are across the road; easy access to the main attractions of the city. Bad points: HATED the beds.They seemed like glorified air-beds where you adjust the firmness by inflating or deflating- I woke with a sore back each morning; too much corridor noise from inconsiderate guests,this was every night including 3.30am on Sunday morning. However, we enjoyed the city very much and everything we wanted to do was walkable but I would not choose this hotel again.

<Content>GREAT CHOICE Just returned from a 5 night stay at this hotel and really enjoyed,big comfortable bedrooms with amazing views (Ask for a city view room,high floor)It seems the bathrooms have been recently upgraded and were really great.Don't get me wrong this is a very ugly hotel from outside and the lobby could do with an upgrade but if you want a great location with very friendly helpful staff(-Wendy springs to mind)that is remarkably quiet it is a great value choice.

<Content>Good location, great pool, helpful service We stayed at the Radisson in Boston for 3 nights in March 2008. The hotel is easy to find and we had a fantastic view from our window. The room was clean and a good size. We couldn't work out how to make the water come out of the bath tap rather than the shower so kids couldn't have baths. The kids enjoyed the pool and the small fitness room has glass walls so you can watch the kids swim while you work out. We had dinner at the Rustic Kitchen one night - my scallops were fabulous - and the breakfast buffet was great. Great advice and directions from the concierge.

<Content>Great stay in downtown Boston Recently spent our first weekend in Boston at the Radisson and we were very pleased with the experience. The hotel is located in a safe area and very near Boston Commons, the Freedom Trail and T-Stops. We received a very reasonable rate, the staff was friendly and helpful and the room clean and comfortable. If you like seafood, be sure to eat at Legal Seafood which is adjacent to the hotel. We very much enjoyed downtown Boston, would love to come back, and would definitely stay at the Raddison again.

<Content>Practical option Although the Radisson鈥檚 location in the theatre district isn鈥檛 very exciting in itself, it was extremely convenient and central for visiting other parts of the city. Good points: smooth check-in, even late at night; location, very comfy beds, good thick curtains, excellent shower, carpeted hallways to deaden noise, well-thought-out arrangements for leaving bags after check-out. Not so good points: balcony over-looking building site, shouting in the hallways, lack of caf茅s/diners in the immediate vicinity to ring the changes at breakfast. Overall a good, practical option if you can find a decent rate.

<Content>Good location and Good quality hotel I stayed at the Radisson in Boston for two weeks on business. I enjoyed the free internet access in the hotel room. The breakfast buffet wasn't bad, though there were some odd choices (thai egg rolls with chilli sauce for breakfast!?).The staff were friendly and responsive. I didn't have a great shower one day due to a large family in the room next door causing pressure problems by using all the water. I did get a free buffet breakfast to make up for it which sorted me out.Location is great, near the shopping district and close enough to the T.

If you book a night at the hotel take the pre-paid parking option, you save$$, the beds are the Sleep Number Beds and are nice,the rooms are clean with plenty of room and the staff was very good.Give it a try..

<Content>Clean, quiet. roomy, comfortable, well-located I stayed in this hotel with my family for 7 nights in March and I can only echo what previous reviewers have said. Great location - one block from Boston Common and the Public Garden, near Boylston T stop so all of Boston is accessible. Rooms are a lot larger than usual for Boston. The fact that each room has a balcony adds to the sense of space and the view is great. Beds can be adjusted to your liking. Good heating  ventilation in rooms. Staff are very helpful and rooms are kept spotless. Room was quiet - we rarely heard other guests.

<Content>Great hotel I stayed at the Radisson for a week when I was in Boston for business. I was very happy with this hotel. It looks kind of old and ugly from the outside - but inside it's fantastic. All the rooms have a full balcony, which is not something you see very often. My room was on the 23rd floor, and I sat outside and watched the sunset over the city most evenings. The room itself was great. I particularly liked the bed - which had a feature where you could adjust how firm you wanted the mattress. Honest to God, I think I slept better here than I have at any other hotel room in my entire life.The location is also great. I had one day off during my stay, and it was an easy walk to all the tourist and historical sights downtown. Plus, you're only about a block from Boston Common, which was great for jogging in the evenings.

<Content>Tired decor I stayed at the Radisson for two nights. The location is great. The d茅cor is tired. There doesn鈥檛 appear to be any handicap accessible way to get to the front desk. The room was huge. There was a complimentary bottle of water. There was a light out in the bathroom. I wasn't crazy about the sleep number bed. There was someone very loud in the next room. The exercise room is in the pool area and was very humid. The exercise equipment was old and one of the two stepper machines wasn't working.

<Content>Nice and clean...but those beds Ok,nothing relevant to say here,the usual clean and crisp Radisson hotel,nice rooms,perfect location and nice staff. But those beds...no no no. the famous sleep number bed. It is by far the most uncomfortable bed i''ve ever slept in. No matters how they dress it up,it is basically and ugly overpriced air mattress,whit all the pros ( pros ? ) and cons ( cons !! ) of an air mattrress. I've basically slept for 8 hours in 2 nights waking up with a lot of pain and aches...terrbile.Will never go back.

<Content>Good Value! Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights from 23/1/08. The check in was swift and easy, the room was on the 16th floor and was facing south east. The view was ok but i think that the other side of the hotel would have had a better view. The room had 2 double beds on which you were able to adjust the softness/hardness of the mattress.Location is central and is a 2 min walk onto Boston common and a 5 min walk to the nearest T station.Did not eat breakfast in the hotel as we prefer to get out and about but we had dinner in the rustic kitchen which is attached to the hotel.The staff were friendly and we didnt have any problems. I would stay at this hotel again

<Content>Satisfactory hotel Definatly one of the better Radisson hotels I have stayed in, you know what to expect when booking a Radisson but this one had a little more, something that made us feel more comfortable. Staff was very helpful, rooms had a bit more space and even if our bathroom was a bit cramped it was fine. I know other rooms had bigger bathrooms but it was not a big deal to us. I am a little unsure of the location, it is close to nice shopping streets but if you turn right toward China town there seemed to be an awful lot of homeless people and drunks. I turned around pretty quick. We had room service and the food was very nice tho expensive but that is to be expected. I also bought a bottle of wine, regular price from a store $5, for $25 and thought even for room service that was way too much. But I cant fault the hotel for that really, that was up to me. You wont be dissapointed in this hotel, no luxury there but otherwise very nice.

<Content>A great deal in a convenient part of town We had previously stayed in a small hotel near Tremont street because on the web it was described as charming. I should have known charming was a euphemism for dorm room.So for the same price as this charming hotel - about $150, we switched to the Radisson. Not only is the Radisson in a MUCH better area (close to Chinatown for late night eating), walkable to the Commons, walkable to the Pru, and also in the middle of the theatre district.The hotel lobby is .... well pretty non-descript. typical 3.5 star corporate hotel lobby. The hotel's exterior is very concrete and not the most interesting. However, the rooms are FANTASTIC. We had a room on the 21st floor and we had the MOST amazing views of Boston skyline. We had two queen beds, a small sitting area and a very nice sized bathroom. For the same price, this was SUCH a HUGE step up from the charming inn.Internet connectivity is free and via an ethernet plug in the room - there is no wifi. Not a problem, just a note.The hotel also has a heated indoor pool and a small work out area next to the pool. The hotel staff is okay - not exactly the most friendly nor the most helpful, but it was fine.

<Content>Hurrah! The price of a deluxe king room was cheaper than a double in another nearby hotel, so we decided to forgo the independently-owned hotel experience for a chain. I am very impressed! We had an issue with our heater in the first room we stayed (started to smell quite like a fire and emit a little puff of smoke!) and we were politely and quickly moved to another identical room on the 22nd floor. The sheets and towels were luxurious in comparison to other hotels I've stayed at-- and excepting in Manhattan, we usually stay in 3 star hotels. The Sleep Number gimmick didn't factor into our comfort though it was a novelty to be toyed with.Breakfast in the Theatre Cafe was good, hearty eggs  bread type stuff. Great coffee. I suggest getting the Breakfast Package when you book your room, it would have been a better deal for us if we had.Parking: Free, free, free-- but you must denote this on your reservation, I think.Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpfu-- this was consistent with every staff member. The man who saw to our heater incident was especially kind and I appreciate that.Noise level: Could hear a bit through walls. At 2am there was a major commotion in the street below: Car horns, sirens, shouting-- sounded like something serious. I could hear everything. I wasn't bothered by it because I was comfortable and sleepy. Hiking the nearby Freedom Trail from end to end made me tired!Did not use pool though it looked lovely.I may seek Radisson Hotels in other cities, but when in Boston, I will stay here.

<Content>Great place to stay in Boston Received a warm and friendly welcome though it was little off putting to be offered a suite on the top floor, though there is a problem with the leaking roof or a King on a lower floor. Didn't fancy paddling across the bedroom so opted for a lower level.Nice bedrooms. Pool was adequate but in need of a refurb, elsewhere the facilities were excellent. Had breakfast and Christmas dinner in the restaurant which were both fine.Location of the hotel is superb. Lots of choices when it comes to dining, from the nearby food court for fast food through to exclusive restaurants plus china town just down the road. The common and start of fredom trail are are very short walk away and the Beacon Hill area is close too.A couple of tips: If you look 35 (no exaggeration) or under and want a drink - take your passport. The drinking laws here are oppressive. The ONLY ID the bars/shops/restaurants/hotels will accept is a local drivers licence, US forces ID or passport. You can't even select a bottle of spirits in the liquor store, it's kept in a roped off area for staff only.If using the metro, known locally as the T, get a 'Charlie' card from the concierge and save 15% on this excellent service.If staying over Christmas be aware that unlike many parts of the US we have visited much of Boston closes down from mid day Christmas Eve until the 26th. Very few restaurants are open and only some corner stores. The T does still run though.

<Content>Decent Hotel Stayed at the Radisson with my fiance for two nights over New Years after a 3 night stay in th Hilton Financial District. We switched to the Radisson as we'd been given a special rate for a wedding we were attending in Boston at the Hilton, which was not valid for 30-31 Dec and the Radisson was approx. $50/night cheaper for those 2 nights.The hotel building is incredibly ugly from the outside, it's a high rise (20+ floors) grey concrete structure, built probably in the 1950's. The interior is fine though, however the lobby has an odd feel as it has 3 seperate outside entrances to it. Our room was on the 16th floor and was huge. On entering the room you walked down a narror corridor into a spacious sitting area with sofa, armchair, TV, desk etc and then on into the bedroom area. The bathroom however was tiny, definitely the smallest I have ever seen in a hotel. It had a toilet, sink and shower crammed in - when you got out of the shower you practically crashed into the sink! It was quite strange that in such a large room the bathroom was so inadequate and was definitely a bit off putting. The room itself was clean and we were given a couple of bottles of free water which was nice.The loction of the hotel was good, just off Boylston St and approx. 15 mins walk from the shops at Copley Place. We didn't really come into contact with any staff, so can't really comment on that.All in all the Radisson was fine. We'd been at the Hilton for 3 nights previously and much prefered that so the Radisson was probably a bit of a let down for us. However I think if we'd stayed in the Radisson for the whole of our trip iwe would have been perfectly happy with it!

<Content>Bostons Best Bet!!! New Years Eve. Paid $168 per night. Stayed 2 nights. Hands down, this hotel is my favorite in Boston so far. The staff/ manager are very friendly. We arrived and were given the option of 2 rooms. A regular king, which we reserved and a jr. suite for the same price!!! Whoo hoo, that's a no brainer. So of course we took the 23rd floor jr. suite. Now, please be advised this room was next to the elevator and if paying very detailed close attention, this noise may bother you. But, as a teacher (we have a high tolerance of noise) and not spending a lit of time in the room itself, it did not bother us. It had a beautiful bathroom, spotless with an open glass shower, no bathtub. the living room extension had a tv cabinet with a small love seat and desk. This room comes with not 1, but 2 balconies. Score! In the bedroom area, it had a huge King bed, white heavenly linens, another tv! 2 night stands and drum roll.... a second balcony. Now, back to the noise... HINT- this side of the hotel (facing the Wang center) is a little noisy due to the construction that is going on. The other side of the hotel, facing the prudential building is a tad quieter, and the views, I think are better, but we were offered this suite and it was great! Had one drink at the Theatre Cafe that was frowned upon in the previous review. We did not have any issues with the staff, but the beer was a little flat. The pool is nice. The workout room is adequate, but Radisson should consider upgrading their equipment. This hotel is in the theatre district. Casual restaurants/bars to check out in walking distance are the Rock Bottom Brewery, Beantown Pub, Remingtons, Jacob Wirths, and the intimate Intermission Tavern. Walking distance to the Boston Commons/ Washingon St. and even Fanuiel Hall. The best part of this New Years Eve was watching the firework show at the Commons from our balconies!!! Again, Radisson Boston , best deal in town. Don't hesitate to ask to be upgraded. It doesn't hurt to ask. We didn't even ask, the manager just offered! We will be back at the end of Jan! ! ! Keep up the good work Radisson! Have a great trip!

<Content>1st Floor Cafe, their RUDE service ruined my Christmas Evening. I did not sleep in the hotel.We went to the cafe on the 2nd floor for coffee and desserts.Cafe wasn't crowed, only 3~4 tables filled w/ people eating dinner.We waited to be seated for 5 min. nobody wouldn't look at us.We seated ourselves.Asked for menu, asked to two male wait staffs, but they didn't bring it for another 5 min., so I had to walk over to pick them up myself.Ordered 5 regular coffee and one Latte, and one hot chocolate. Also asked for a dessert menu. while the wait-staff brought coffees, he slop the cream container, and some sprinkled on my lady company, he never apologized.There was a manager on the floor, walking around and visiting other tables asking how things were. We'd stayed there for about one hour, she didn't bother to even look at us. we would had felt less ignored if the place was busy; there were 2~3 wait staffs on the floor and one manager walking around while only four dinner tables were filled during the entire time. Maybe all those attending staffs there were upset because 6 of us came to drink coffee and have dessert there, or maybe they didn't like having asians sitting there using their services.In either way, all staffs there were very ignorant of us, and when they did respond to our request for service, the looks on their faces and tones of their voices were certainly not at all accomodating to the extent that we felt like we had to apologize for being there and were not wanted there.I would not recommend that place for either to stop by for a drink and desserts, or, for our fellow asians.Maybe, despite their proximate location to Chinatown, they didn't want to ruin their image by having asian group of people eating and talking there.Or, maybe they were offended that people came over just for coffee and desserts.I won't step my foot on Radisson; that's for certain.

<Content>Good Hotel Good hotel and definitely a good location for walking around Boston. Do ask for a high up room, we seemed to get an upgrade to a suite with a great view of Boston. We were disappointed with breakfast, the buffet was certainly not up to the standard we are used to in Europe in comparable hotels, so would not include that in our room rate if we use this hotel again. While there we got the bus to the Wrentham village outlet mall which the concierge organised but I think they may have added a few dollars on for phoning and also 30 mins to Salem which was interesting.

<Content>Good value, spacious room I stayed for three nights, my second time staying at this property. The rooms are spacious, with a great view of the downtown buildings, location is fabulous for walking to many sites and attractions. Now for the room, spacious and up to date, especially the bathrooms. Bathrobes were very comfy, housekeeping excellent, beds and linens were most restful. I would stay again. Only issues were shower water was very warm but never reached really hot, the way I like it. Oddly, the flush of the toilet is so strong it sprays up and outside of the toilet, put the seat cover down when flushing, or else!

<Content>Location, location, location Booked the Radisson through hotwire, and got a great $120 rate. I was surprised at how nice it was for the money. Out room was spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. And the service was friendly and efficient. The pool was definitely a family destination, but the exercise room was more than adequate.But the great part was the location. So close to Boston Common, Back Bay, and Newberry Street. Overall an excellent experience.

<Content>Brilliant Stay! Myself and my husband and our three year old son have just returned from our trip to Boston. We stayed at the Radisson for four nights and really enjoyed ourselves. The room and bathroom were huge and absolutely spotless and the view from the balcony was fantastic! We had breakfast in the Theatre Cafe every morning - there was a choice of hot or cold buffet and also an a la carte menu if you wanted something different (waffles, steak and eggs etc..) The food was hot, well presented, tasty and reasonably priced. The hotel is situated two blocks from Boston Common, 10-15 minutes walk from Downtown Crossing and about 3 minutes to the end of Boylston/Newbury St. We walked almost everywhere and found the area to be very safe. The only downside was the cost of parking - $28 dollars a night. We were a bit shocked, but this seems to normal for the area - very little parking to be found. Driving in Boston is a nightmare, all tunnels and one way streets - we definitely wouldn't drive again! Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Radisson and would definitely stay here again in the future!

<Content>Sorry excuse for customer service Contacted this property with a 5 night reservation. Was driving a large U-Haul type van. Was told by reservation staff and valet staff it should be no problem parking at a lot down the street. Arrived at the hotel. Sorry there is nothing we can do for you situation. What is a person to do. Had a 5 night reservation, big bucks. At least they admitted they had no idea on what to do and offered a cancellation of the reservation without any cancellation fees. I have never heard of people not being able to put their heads together to find a solution to a somewhat easy problem. I did get a reservation at another hotel, but this was after numerous hours driving around and waiting for people who couldn't do their jobs. Radisson, at least be honest if you are unable to accommodate large vehicles. It would have saved us alot of frustration and gas.

The area is safe and walking distance to tourist spots. Try visiting fine Asian Restaurant about 3 blocks away, it is worth the experience.

<Content>Excellent stay The Radisson is a well-appointed hotel in a great location. The nice sized, clean room included two very comfortable beds and a large bathroom for a very reasonable price. The staff, in particular Crystal, was pleasant and accomodating. A friend and I stayed for a long weekend in late November. Neither of us had been to Boston previously and were not familiar with the transportation system. The concierge was extremely helpful, and we were easily able to make our way to all destinations via the train or bus. Our flight into Boston on Friday was cancelled, so we missed our Friday night stay at the hotel. We were offered an additional day at the hotel at no additional cost.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel in a great location!! I stayed here with a friend for 5 days and could not have faulted the place in any way. I have stayed in the Radisson on Lexington Avenue in NYC but Boston, MA was so much better. We stayed in a double double-bedded room, tons of space for two people and the beds really comfortable - I have to admit i did break the inflating matress but i did manage to laugh myself to sleep that night :). Free paper and water delivered to your door every morning and the view from our balcony window looked right across the city. The hotel is conveniently located one block away from the Boston Common and a few blocks away from ChinaTown. The bathroom was spotless and there were bags of fresh towels delivered every morning along with the maid-service. There are a couple of bars close in the area although the night-life was pretty quiet - ideal for families or romantic trips away.Ill definitley be back next year!

<Content>Loved The Radisson and Location We (party of four) stayed here from 19th-22nd Nov, We had booked two rooms and upon check in we were advised that one of the rooms had been upgraded to a junior suite. Both rooms were great with more than adequate tea/coffee making facilities, plenty of toiletries in the bathroom, towels and terrycloth robes. The sleepnumber beds were unbelievably comfortable, one can change the firmness/softness of one or both sides of the bed. The swimming pool and gym area were an added bonus and kept very clean, also you pick up fresh towels from the poolside if using the pool or gym.The restaurant in the hotel was great. We found breakfast fine with a good choice on the menu. We had thanksgiving dinner in the restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed it and the waiting staff were more than pleasant. We got room service one evening and it was delivered quickly and unlike a lot of other hotels of the same quality not outrageously priced.The reception staff were very courteous and friendly and were only too happy to give directions or reccommend a good restaurant. All in all we had a fantastic stay and got a really good deal on the hotels website. We will definitely be staying here next time we're in Boston.

<Content>Radisson was GREAT Spent two nights prior to a fall foliage tour of New England. We had considered several hotels and picked this one due to location. They gave us a great Deluxe Room on 17th floor with balcony and a wonderful view of downtown and Boston Commons. The staff was cordial and the restaurant had good choices at reasonable prices. We took a trolley tour then visited several nearby restaurants and walked thru Boston Commons. When we return to Boston this is where we will stay!!

<Content>The Reviews are True - This hotel meets the mark! All of the positive reviews are true. I stayed for 2 nights during the week on a business trip and paid $259 plus tax on Radisson's web site. This is a four star hotel without a doubt. Ugly from the outside but clean, spacious, business friendly, and well situated in Boston. Nothing really fancy or modern. The service is excellent. I would recommend this hotel for business travelers and those wanting a basic four star hotel for a vacation. If you are looking for romance, luxury, or upscale surroundings, this is not the four star hotel I would choose.

<Content>A short stay but generally good Only a short stay in Boston on business...but a very decent room, reasonably helpful bellhops (although they ask directly for tips!) and a good location. A little on the pricey side, but it was clean and well placed if you want to take a walk 'round downtown Boston.

<Content>Great Stay- Friendly Staff I also stayed at this hotel in late October for an annual meeting at the convention center and I must agree, it was a wonderful stay. The hotel had great location for walking to restaurants (you MUST try Finale 1 block away) and was a short walk to the Boston Commons, Public Gardens, and shopping in Beacon Hill. The hotel staff was very friendly and each room key sleeve has a pull out map of the area which was extremely helpful (and made for a cute souvenir!) Room was comfortable, clean, and plush and the view from my room, 2019, was awesome. Overall great stay. Sleep number beds were a bit of a let down (like sleeping on an air mattress) and the noise from all the other room's sleep number compressors being pumped up and down was loud and annoying. (I'm a light sleeper) Nice bathroom but water pressure stunk due to rain shower heads (not so good for us long haired girls) Only suggestion- put a chair or two on the balcony so we can enjoy the view.

<Content>Comfortable  I was on business for the week and this hotel is certainly very comfortable and had free internet access in the rooms, which is great. Big beds that you can adjust to your own comfort. Free newspaper everyday. The bar was not in a great location and there is no real lounge area in the lobby to meet and chat. The location itself is good though only 10 mins from Boston Common and about 15 mins from Quincy market. For us it was expensive but this may have been because of the time of year and the fact there was a conference.The guy on the concierge was very helpful and didnt want a tip! Would recommend.

<Content>Nice Stay at the Radisson I stayed at the Radisson Boston from Oct 21-Oct 24 while attending a conference at the convention center. Check-in was very smooth  efficient  I was given a room on the 11th floor. The Radisson is billed as a non-smoking hotel, which was my primary reason for booking there, but on entering my room I was greeted with the odor of stale cigarette smoke. Why do smokers do this? I phoned the reception desk and they offered me a new room. After a trip down the elevator with my suitcase, I was reassigned to room 2121, which was virtually identical minus the cigarette smell and with a fantastic view of downtown. The room was comfortable and nicely furnished. The bathroom had a nice showerhead and decent water pressure. Best of all was the sleep number bed, which was very comfy. Though my room was located near the elevators, it was very quiet--one of the most quiet rooms I've experienced in any city I've visited. I really didn't spend much time in the room except for sleeping and didn't use the fitness center, restaurants, pool, etc. Other than the cigarette smoke, my only complaint is that the hotel is a little far from the convention center, requiring use of shuttle buses or taxis. Traffic is snarly so it took awhile either way to get to meetings. Fortunately there is shopping, restaurants and sightseeing within walking distance.

<Content>Loved our stay!! My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights this past September and I would definitely go back... the hotel is very clean, rooms are lovely, and location is great. It is just a few short blocks from the Boston Common  Public Gardens... and walking everywhere else we found quite simple. I admit I was at first worried about staying here after reading some of the reviews, but we couldn't have had a more pleasant stay. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful, and as I stated above the rooms were clean and beautiful. We paid $259 a night which is a bit steep, but to stay in a nice hotel right in the midst of things in Boston it was well worth it.

<Content>City break hotel with expensive extras We felt the hotel location was good for a city break. Close to theatre district and just a short walk to the city common and financial area. Plenty of bars and places to eat within short walk of hotel. No need to use the u/ground. Our room was very well appointed and maintained. Breakfast was ok, we didn鈥檛 have room service or eat in the associated Italian restaurant during our stay. Couple of issues though relating to add on costs. Bear in mind we were on a touring holiday around New England with emphasis on touring and holiday. So I left both my laptop and cell phone at home. Use of the hotel PC to access the Internet just to check on soccer scores and F1 race (not on USA sports channel) was extortionate. With PC鈥檚 costing little more than a few hundred dollars it should be free, not $30 per hour. Same with phone calls. All other motels I used during our trip I could make a short (10-15min) interstate call to my friends in USA for free. Same call at Radisson $23 !! Big Rip Off. Then there was in bottled water. In a room charged at over $200 per night they want to charge extra for each small bottle of mineral water that you use after arrival. Even Bigger Rip Off !So whilst we had a good time in Boston and had no major issues with the hotel 鈥?the expensive add on charges for services that cost the hotel almost nothing sours my view of the Radisson. But if you can address or don鈥檛 need these things it was ok.

<Content>Great location, overall good but bed comfort could be improved I was there for a conference. The location is excellent - in the heart of Boston. Overall it is a good, clean hotel. The beds have the select number system for making them softer or firmer. I did not particularly liked this because it feels somewhat like an inflatable matress. I prefer the regular pillow top mattersses other hotels use. Also, the cover was a heavy down comforter which was too hot even when I lowered the A/C to 60. There was no thin blanket.Wireless intenet connection was very, very slow - almost unusable.

<Content>Handy location. Not a bad hotel for the money Stayed here as a family for 5 nights. Room was a fair size and clean. Balcony was a bonus - great to see the city views, particularly at night when everything was lit up. The location was within walking distance of everything we needed and easy access to T for longer trips.Pool area was a disappointment - One of our main reasons for choosing this hotel was the pool as our son loves swimming but a refurb is going on and the pool heating was off so the pool was too cold to go in. We weren't informed of this when booking or on check in. We didn't use the restaurant so can't comment on that. Plenty of restaurants across the street or within easy walking. Overall, not bad for the money.

<Content>Rude and Insincere Staff I am writing to let other travelers know of my bad experience with The Radisson in Boston. After booking 3 rooms on Priceline.com, there was a huge mix up upon check -in. My friend was trying to be funny and booked 3 rooms and using funny alias's as our last names. Upon check-in, we realized that this going to be a problem. We take full responsiblity for causing a headache for the front desk but it was how they handled the situation that started our stay with The Radisson off on the wrong foot.  First of all, there were 5 of us in our group, each of us in our 40's, and all of us work in the hospitality industry. We have the upmost respect for anyone that works in the industry and were definitely not trying to be difficult. The front desk was rude, condescending and insincere in trying to resolve the problem. We nicely offered them the option that if this situation is going to be a major problem we would just cancel the reservations and find another hotel. (No hard feelings, we would just move on) The five of us could not be more laid back. The response we got from the Front Desk, Fine, but you still have to pay for the rooms because they were booked on Priceline.com. They could not have cared less about trying to resolve the problem. Finally, we contacted Priceline.com and had a letter faxed over and eventually we were able to head to our rooms. Even after all of this headache, we chalked it up to the girl at the front desk having a bad day! No problem, we are in Boston to enjoy ourselves, not let some inadequate staff member ruin our weekend. After returning from a nice dinner and a night on the town in beautiful Boston, we were back at the hotel and taking the elevator up to our rooms. We were joking in a very nice way about not wanting to upset the front desk staff member. On the elevator with us was an employee of the hotel. Once we stepped out of the elevator and headed down the hallway, this employee actually stepped out of the elevator and started making sarcastic comments to us!! We were absolutely stunned by the lack of professionalism of this staff.  The next day, four of us checked out and headed out of town. About 45 minutes later, we were trying to call our friend that stayed behind and realized that his cell phone was turned off. So, we called the hotel and asked to be connected to his room. They had no listing for our friend! So, we told them the room number and explained that we checked out about an hour ago. After being on the phone with them for about 3-4 minutes, they told us that he checked out. About 45 minutes later, our friend calls us from the hotel lobby telling us that he is getting ready to check out of the hotel. We told him that we had been trying to get in touch with him but the front desk told us that he had checked out already!! (Which he didn't!!) So then we figured, maybe we called the wrong Radisson. So, we call back and ask ed, Is this The Radisson on such and such street? They actually gave us attitude over the phone for asking for their location!!!!!!!!!! I am not making any of this up!!!!! That is when all of us had enough of this miserable staff at The Radisson. I have never written a letter of complaint to any hotel, restaurant, or any other type of service industry business. I sent an e-mail to The Radisson explaining my dissatifaction with my stay and received this cookie cutter letter of an apology mostly defending the normal behavior of this staff. After giving the manager all of the information that she needed to do her investigation, I never heard from her again!!! Customer Service at it 's finest!!! I will never frequent a Radisson again.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location Excellent value and excellent hotel. Staff was friendly and helpful. This hotel is in the Theater District and only a few blocks from the Freedom Trail, Boston Commons, and several subway stations. You can get a 7 day pass for $15, walk two blocks and be anywhere in the city in 5 minutes, including Harvard, Fenway Park , Boston Harbor, and other tourist destinations. The hotel rooms have been updated, the pool was clean, and meals in the hotel excellent. I would recommend this Radisson for singles, couples or families.

<Content>worst service ever!!! I did not stay at this hotel! I attended a wedding and it was the worst service ever!! The waiter practically threw our dinner in front of us!!! Then he shouted at me cause i wanted chicken i did not have a sign in front me ( no idea you had to do that), then our table had a money kitty goin on the table, it was in a coffee cup but it was in obvious there was money in it!!! The rude waitor came around to clear our champagne glasses and water glasses, we were all at the table but passed no remarks at him.. then guess what money was gone!!! He obviously took the money, we spoke to 3 managers and they never even apologised!! They said we basically could not prove anything !!! The management crew really need to sort them selves out and as for the wait staff, they def do not have people skills at all.I will never set foot in this hotel again and i advice everyone else to do the same!!!

<Content>Great location We're a family of four, kids 11 and 13. We had two queen beds and the room was large with a small balcony. It was clean and the Sleep Number beds were very, very comfortable. We got the free parking and breakfast plan. The breakfast was excellent; a buffet with something a little different every day (apple pancakes, bacon, rolls, bagels, oateal, etc. - lots of food and could also order omelets, french toast, pancakes, et.c fro the ktchen). Bathroom was roomy enough. The view from upper floor (we were on 17) was quite nice. The pool wasn't heated when we were here and it was freezing but the deck outside the pool was relaxing with lounge chairs and tables for eating outside. The only thing I think the room needed was a chair or two on the balcony. The staff was always pleasant. You could easily walk to Newbury street for shopping, the Swan Boats, the Prudential Building, theatre. Nice place.

<Content>NIce hotel - good location I stayed at the Boston Radisson while attending a conference in Boston. The hotel is pretty good and it seems like the bedrooms have been refurbished recently. The leisure facilities are a bit below par, but they are currently renovating the area and hopefully that will improve things (the fitness centre consists of two bikes, two treadmills, two steppers and some free weights, all of which are very old). Location-wise, the hotel is very close to Boston Common, but about 25 mins walk from the main tourist-area of Fanueil Hall/Quincy Market. However, this area is easily accessible using the T subway service. All the hotel staff were very helpful - particularly John, the very nice concierge!

<Content>All the good reviews are true It was hard to pass on a hotel whose reviews were almost all 4-5 so we tried the Rad. for one night and it was excellent. The location is great, the employees friendly and very helpful, rooms clean as a whistle and views outstanding. Try to get on the east facing side as there is a little more to see from your private balcony. We had a room on the 23 rd floor facing west and it was nice going outside for a drink or two overlooking the great city of Boston. We went with the bed and breakfast package which was 30 or so dollars more than the standard AAA rate but also included parking in the enclosed attached parking garage which is usually 28 dollars. So if you look at it as your going to spend the $28 on parking, spend a couple bucks more and get the breakfast too. Iincluded all the normal hot breakfast items such as bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, bagels, toast, hot and cold cereals, yogurt, fresh fruit, milk, coffee, tea and juice...and maybe a couple more items that I'm forgetting. I'll be going back for sure!

<Content>Great bet in Boston I recently spent a weekend in Boston and selected the Radisson because I could use my Am Ex miles there. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the hotel was not only very conveniently located, but also a top-notch accommodation. The room was spotless, and the fixtures and furniture seemed brand-new, the A/C worked beautifully and there was complete quiet. There was also the amusement factor of having a Sleep-number bed to try out. Though I may not rush out to buy the mattress for home use, it was certainly comfortable. I also noticed that the hotel had a pool which I didn't have time to use, but it seemed to be a big hit with families. Finally, the staff was friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay there again my next time in Boston.

<Content>Great Location... Great hotel We chose to stay here based on the Trip Advisor reviews! Thanks everyone! It was the right choice. Great location. The room was actually 2 rooms with a balcony. The bathroom was small with only a shower but very updated. The Comfort Bed was wonderful. We were on the 20th floor with a great view. The outside of the hotel can only be described as ugly.. but everything else makes up for it. The pool deck was a nice place to escape to for some relaxation. We enjoyed several nearby restaurants, such as Legal Seafood, Maggianos, Bouchee's on Newbury, Joe's American Rest on Newbury and Davide' in the North End. We also took a dinner cruise on the Sprit of Boston, the food wasn't great but the views were spectacular. We had drinks at the Oak Bar at the Fairmont! Boston is a wonderful city can't wait to go back.

<Content>Loved the Radisson We had a three night stay and would definitely recommend this hotel. Good sized modern rooms with comfortable beds (mattress can be adjusted to suit).Well located - within easy walking distance to City Centre and other districts, including Beacon Hill, Newbury Street and Back Bay. The hotel pool and roof top sunbathing area is a bonus, and provides a chance to wind down after a days sightseeing / shopping.Staff are very helpful - Concierge providing good info for eating  shopping locally.The hotel's breakfast buffet provides a wide choice, and at $16 is considered value for money compared to other local eating places.Will definitely stay there again when next visiting Boston.

<Content>Loved the Radisson We have just returned from a holiday in the US, staying three nights at the Radisson Boston and then moving on to Cape Cod.If only the hotel in Hyannis could have been as good as the Radisson.We could not fault it any way. The location was great and there were lots of wonderful restaurants nearby. The food in theatre cafe attached to the hotel served a delicious breakfast, whether you chose hot or cold.The rooms were clean and the beds, the most comfortable I have ever slept in!The staff were welcoming and couldn't do enough to help. I went down to reception one evening to report a slight problem with the toilet not flushing as it should , and the maintenance man had arrived at my room to fix it before I got back to it !We loved Boston and we loved the Radisson- we will definitely go back and stay there again.

<Content>Exactly what I needed. After a terrible day of air travel and getting lost in the backwards, crooked and completely terrible road system of Boston, MA; we finally found the hotel and I was thoroughly impressed. It was probably the nicest place I've ever stayed at. The hotel room was clean, modern, large and had a great set of sleep number beds. The parking was pricey, but most big cities are like that, I put up with it because it was such a nice hotel. They treated us very well and answered all our questions. They directed us towards local bars and restaurants with simple directions and gave us great directions to Fenway Park.I can't recommend this hotel enough. If you're in Boston and don't mind spending a few hundred on a hotel; this is the place to stay...

<Content>Radisson Hotel Boston Hotel is in an ideal location. Rooms are very large, very clean and the beds very comfortable. They also have connecting rooms. By phoning the hotel directly I was able to get a very nice rate, including parking. Hotel is also easy to get to if you are driving- very little driving on Boston streets is necessary, but just park the car and leave it after you check in. The King suite room we were in is very large, but is right next to the elevators- if elevator noise bothers you, this could be a problem. Hotel breakfast buffet very pricey - you can walk a block to a food court in an office building/mall kind of place and get Dunkin donuts for a fraction of the cost. Conceirge is very helpful. Tube is about a 5 minute walk away ( walk through the same food court to get to the station), although for some reason the green line was having troubles while we were there. Would gladly stay there again.

<Content>baseball FANS from afar should stay here This hotel is a prime example of you get what you pay for hotel.Great location, Parking problems do not exist and its a doable walk from just about everything is Boston.YOU can take a walk to Fenway park from here about a slow 45 min to an hour avg walk. That gives you a quick once over over Boston's shopping district. You can See the famous Duck tour landsea boats and decide if you want to go. But do buy an advance ticket  come back the latter in the day or another if you want to do this boat/land ride around town as you will spend more time waiting than seeing sites or if you like to people watch you can just sit there and wait. But you can do that at the hometown mall.If your are driving into Boston this is the place to stay for a 2 night stint any longer and the value of this place goes down.

<Content>Great Stay, Good Service Radisson Hotel Boston was a great value for me since I used their website to book my stay. I had, unfortunately, forgot to bring my Red Sox tickets with me. I arranged to get my tickets to the hotel and the staff was wonderful with how they managed my panic. They were most gracious and understandable. Need to say that I got my tickets the day of the game.Another opportunity presented itself to the staff when my luggage was late,. The staff was very sympathetic and helped me with this too.The hotel was very good and had a wonderful bed so that I was somehow able to sleep despite my personal misfortunes. The conceirge told me how to get to places I was not familiar with. I loved the fact that this hotel had efficient elevators so that I felt that I was getting along wjtb my vacation in a good mannet. I just hope others may go to this hotel as it is in a very good location.This hotel has a very friendly staff.

<Content>Excellent Stayed here for 3 nights and just have to say it was brilliant , the location was central to everything the rooms were perfect the staff , great !! in particular the concierge John and Christine were so helpful and sent us in the right direction, regarding tours ,and restaurants, The usual Radisson style everything clean ,airy and spacious. Top Marks only drawback..... The hotel like most nowaday,s is non smoking.. but the balconies are available if you feel like a sly one. Great city ,quite in comparison to New York, but just as enjoyable without the hassle ,and only 10 minutes from the airport, Eating out dont miss PF CHANGS just across from hotel, Chinese food at it,s best

<Content>Very pleased We stayed at radisson prior to a cruise and were very pleased. We paid $139 in late June via hotwire.com.Despite arriving very early at 10am, we were immediately given a room. The room, location, and service were all top notch. Much more like a hilton than a typical radisson. The location, in particular is great... right by boston common in a safe area that is convenient to various attractions.Only complaint was internet - business center charges 10 bucks for 15 minutes.

<Content>Great choice! I did the homework, scored a good rate and was very pleased with the Radisson Boston. The hotel is a half a block away from the big Hertz rental office downtown, a short walk to the Common, even shorter walk to the Jump on/Jump off Trolley stop, and a few steps away from the most delicious baked/stuffed lobster dinner anywhere at Legal's. Our room was on the 18th floor, a glass slider opened onto a balcony with a great view downtown. The room was clean, updated and comfortable. The sleep number beds received mixed reviews from our group (I liked it) but, everyone appeared to have gotten a good nights sleep. Radisson is a upromise partner, icing on the cake for you parents with a upromise college account for the kids.

<Content>Great deal! My husband and I are finishing up a 4 day stay here and it has been a great deal all the way around. We booked with the hotel directly and got the breakfast package which included a nice breakfast for 2 each day and parking. We were here to see the sights and the location is PERFECT. Located in the theater disctrict we have walked to everything since we arrived. The room was very comfortable and clean. There have been some heat records set this week and I have to say that the temp in the room when we would come back after a day of touring, was soooo cold and comfortable. I would definately stay here again as it is a great place for the money.

Despite being an ugly concrete block, the hotel is comfortable and good value for money being about $50 per night cheaper than Jurys etc. The lobby is large and well furnished (previous reviews implied shabby but seemed fine to me). All rooms are large and have balconies, albeit concrete and not very decorative but still a plus. Pool (large but a little dated) is also a plus as is the very large sundeck with loungers. Be sure to ask for an upper floor (24th is top floor) - even numbers have a distant view of the harbour. On better edge of theatre district, good eating adjacent to hotel, close to park and Newbery Street shops.

<Content>Very Good Stay Good central location, walkable to most popular areas. Easily accessed from the Interstate. Ok, it's not the prettiest (a concrete tower really) but then you don't have to look at it from your balcony!) A very high standard of finishings throughout. It definitely has a luxurious feel to it. Fast/ efficient check-im/out. No complaints at all. Excellent beds and rooms. Taking bags/ cases from the hotel car park to the lobby and then to your room is tricky due to having to use the carpark elevator, carry the bags down a small flight of stairs and then another elevator to get to the guest rooms. My advice is to park at the front door and offload luggage or use the valet parking service for a hassle-free stay. The breakfast in the hotel was good and at a reasonable price. I would definitely go back if visitng Boston. although it's not cheap it gives a great level of service/ accommodation for the price. I suppose you get what you pay for. You can book this hotel with no worries.

<Content>Very nice and great location This hotel was very nice. We did an overnight in Boston and this hotel claimed to be very near the theater district, which it was. We were able to walk under 5 minutes to the Shubert Theater. Checking in was easy and were able to do early. Room was great and had a nice view. The sleep number beds, pool and both restaurants were great! The staff was very helpful too! Will definately stay again.

<Content>Excellent Beds  Good Place to stay in Boston. Superfast check in on arrival, real time account on your tv, and checkout using your real time account on your tv. Front counter staff were friendly, concierge approachable and knowledgeable. Unfortunately, the in room safe was left locked by (presumeably) the joker who previous stayed there. They immediately offered to change a room when I called about it or I could use the safe at the front counter. We decided not to bother with a change as we had our stuff all unpacked. The sleep number beds were excellent. But as in many downtown hotels in big cities, Sat night's sleep was interrupted by police sirens and traffic though we were on 20th floor. There's a drinks vending machine and free ice machine on the floor, and there's a bank teller machine in the lobby. The location is great, 1block to Boston Commons and T stations, 15minutes walk (abt 4blocks) to copley place-prudential center, Hard Rock cafe (which is moving this June to Fanueil House). It's in the Theater district, and there's a legal seafood right across the street, lots of food and pubs across the road too.

<Content>Overpriced for my budget After doing some hotel searching I decided to make a reservation at the Boston Radisson. I only live about 45mins from Boston but its a long drive home after hitting up the bars. I was searching more for location than amenities. A friend was arriving at Logan and we didnt want her to have to spend a lot of money for a taxi to the hotel (according to the RAD's site, Logan is 3 miles away but still cost her $17 in fare). We also picked it based on its location to the local bars/night activity. It is located right in the theater district so if your going to see the Blue Man group this is within walking distance. I made this reservation on the phone with the front desk. The woman was very polite and informative. The transaction went without a hitch and she was able to give me the online discount.The hotel was very easy to get to from the Ma Pike. I fear getting lost on the many one way streets and dealing with rabid taxi drivers!Once we pulled in to the tiny entrance area a valet driver quickly unloaded our bags and took the car away. Check in took exactly 2 mins. With a license and credit card verification we were off to our room on the 19th floor.....however we carried our bags to our room.The room was beautiful and clean. The bathroom was small but modern and bright. The tub was huge and my boyfriend even took the opportunity to soak for awhile! Everything the website said would be in the room was in fact there....including the hairdryer which came in handy as I forgot mine. Upon entering however, the room was a stagnant 82degrees. With the AC turned on high the thermostat never went below 77, but it was still comfortable.The beds looked like they were fit for a king, complete with down comforters! No cheesy or stained top blankets from the 70s! BUUUTTTT...... the sleep number bed wasnt all that great. Its an overpriced air mattress and wasn't to my liking. Maybe sleeping solo would have proved more comfortable, but I felt every movement from my partner. Now when those infomercials come on I can change the channel and not feel like I'm missing out on the latest and greatest bed craze!The breakfast buffet was great! Everything was hot and tasty... a nice way to recharge after a long night!The biggest draw back of this hotel was the price. I recently came back from a trip to Mexico where I stayed in a 4 star all-inclusive resort for 7 days. For the price of one night in Boston I could have gone back to MX for 4! After taxes my bill was $317~ no room service or additional add-ons! Needless to say it took the wind out of my sail till I made it to CHEERS for a beer....then I forgot out the chunk taken out of my wallet! For the price we paid I think the bell boy could have atleast taken the luggage to the room!Would I stay here again, sure....If I won the lottery. I just dont have $300 to throw down for a one night stay! Next time I'll research more.

<Content>Great location; Comfortable hotel - shame about the building We picked the Radisson by chance out of a very long list of Boston hotels.Despite being the ugliest building in Boston it is a comfortable hotel whose location is fantastic for most of the central Boston attractions.The bed and breakfast package is good value tooRooms were comfortable and well furnished and most with great views (ask for a high floor number). The foyer and pool are dingy and in need of a bit of work

<Content>The Best thing they could do is drop the Radisson name! I have stayed at several Radisson hotels throughout the country and they have all been the same...HORRIBLE! Until now! My wife and I were blown away by this hotel. I would actually have to say the this is the top 5 hotel rooms I have stayed in. If you are looking for breathtaking lobby's - stay away - the building itself and the lobby etc are very boring and kind of drab. However, the rooms are fantastic! Very clean, big and modern. When we got to our room my wife and I just stood there amazed at how nice and clean it all was. Whatever management runs the Boston site, needs to take over for all the other sites. We almost didn't stay at this hotel just because it had the radisson name on it...but i can' describe how wonderful this hotel was. EXCELLENT!

<Content>Great Location, Nice, Clean Hotel We stayed here for 4 nights in May 2007. The hotel is located in a very safe area, approx. 7 minutes walking distance from the subway and 5 minutes from Boston Commons/Boston Garden. Fenway Park is just 2 subway stops away from the closest subway. The room itself was very nice...it had a sitting room (with TV) and the bed area (with TV). The bed was a Sleep Number bed, very comfortable. The room was extremely clean. Staff were all very courteous. We asked for and were given a room on a high level (18th) that had a nice view of Boston. We would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Luxury and value co-exist Stayed here from May 13-16, 2007; in Boston for college graduations. The staff communications was the only place I could locate anything needing inprovement. Not sure if it's just the Boston melting-pot ambience but there are seem to be too many people there who practice ESL. The dialogues frequently needed repeating for both parties. Otherwise, the room was very nice, clean, and comfortable. The amenities were good quality typical, and the maintenance had been kept in top order throughout the facility as far as I expereinced during this stay. There was a low rumble occasionally that began about 5 am - not sure if it was the T train outside or the elevator. Overall, though, we will likely stay here if we ever happen to visit the East Coast again, as well as seek other Radisson properties for future travel.

<Content>My favorite Boston hotel I've traveled to Boston for business a number of times now, always staying in a different location. This time my husband came along, so we were looking for a hotel with a good central location and high-speed internet. We found the Radisson online and thought we'd give it a try.Check-in was a breeze, finding our room was easy, and we were thrilled when we walked in and saw how huge our space was! The bedroom was at the end of the room, with its own TV and thermostat, then there was a sitting area with another TV and a desk. This was especially nice for my husband, since he was working from the hotel all week, and he felt like he had a little more space and wasnt confined to a small room.The bathroom was TINY and we did have some issues with the toilet. The force of the flushing was so intense that our floor usually ended up wet by evening time. We had a shower only, but it was a good sized shower with nice water pressure.The view from the room was great- we were on the 17th floor and enjoyed looking out at the city views.The workout room was kind of pathetic, but it was functional and we used it most days. Overall, we were extremely pleased with the place and will stay there again.

<Content>A Runners Dream We stayed here for the Marathon again. We have been here now for 3 years, and they just keep getting better. The rooms are big and comfortable for a city hotel, which is always nice. But what makes the biggest difference is their staff. Every year I come, they get better and better at their jobs. They truly know how to make someone feel like their at home. The front desk is amazing, housekeeping attentive, and the restaurant serves a greta meal. Come here and you won't be dissapointed.

<Content>Good location, nice hotel This hotel was pleasant. It was in a good location. The staffwas friendly. It was a little expensive at 199.00, but overall wewere happy with what we got. The room was very nice. It was clean and comfortable. Only problem was the balcony was not safe for smaller children. I did not even want my 8 year old out onthe balcony. We were on a high floor and the balcony which was solid concrete was only waist high. The view was great,but as a parent I thought the balcony should have been higher.We did not get to really enjoy it. I would stay here again.

<Content>Excellent service I stayed at the Radisson as one of a group of 40 that travelled to Boston for the St. Patricks day parade. I found the staff extremely helpful and pleasant. The hotel facillities are really good, including on site swimming pool, rooms are above average size, excellent beds, spotlessly clean, restaurant is well above average and hotel is very centrally located and convienient to airport (12 mins by cab) The reservations dept were extremely helpful throughout and were not in the least fazed by the inevitable changes to bookings that is inherrent in a large group. In short, highly recommended and would definately stay there again when in Boston.

<Content>Great view, location, price... Love the Radisson-Boston: Sweeping views of the city from private balconies, spacious, nicely-appointed rooms, great service, and a fantastic location. And all at a great price! For half the cost of the fancier hotels, the Radisson provides many of the same services and amenities, such as valet parking, room-service (good and fast), clean  bright modern baths, robes, comfy Sleep Number beds, spacious rooms, newly-released movies, Internet connection, a quality restaurant/bar, convenience shop, concierge, and all-around attentive service. We would have been happy to just lay on our comfy king size bed, watch movies and order room service, but the city beckoned. The location is hard to beat. Walk to theatres, fine restaurants, shops, Boston Commons  Public Gardens, Copley Square, Newbury Street, Tob of the Hub, historic sights, and on and on. Most of Boston is walkable, but if you'd rather, 10 minutes in a taxi will bring you almost anywhere. Or take a trolley tour of the city and they'll pick you up right at the hotel. Because the Boston Radisson is so fun and affordable, we're already looking forward to our next weekend getaway.

<Content>Changing my mind about Radissons... As a frequent business traveler who has high expectations for my hotel stays, I tend to book or avoid the same hotel chains based on my experiences there. For a long time, I avoided Radissons as a chain because I had many bad experiences with their brand, especially in the area of customer service.However, with my company booking travel, I sometimes have no choice in where I stay, and that is how I ended up at the Radisson in Boston. And boy am I glad I did! In the past my favorite hotels in Boston have been the Doubletree downtown, and the Tremont (currently owned by Courtyard by Mariott). But the Radisson blows them away. The rooms are a beautiful size, with balconies, and both a desk area and a sitting area. Additionally, there is a small shelf in an alcove just inside the door for the coffee machine and ice--a nice touch that other hotels would do well to adopt. I'm always frustrated by having to have my coffee machine on my desk or in my bathroom. The only thing that would improve the room would be a small fridge  microwave--with all the great restaurants downtown and a week long stay, I had a lot of leftovers that I would love to have kept and reheated for snacks.The bathroom seemed almost new, with an extraordinarily deep tub, and hallelujah, a bathrobe--again, a simple touch that ups the class of the room several notches. Service was prompt and professional, yet not intrusive, and the location cannot be beat.The fitness room is not spectacular, nor is the pool (no whirlpool or sauna), but both are adequate for the business traveler or casual workout.The location is fantastic, within easy walking or transit to everything you want to do in Boston. I highly recommend this hotel, and would come back here for a leisure stay. I'm hoping more of the Radissons that I will stay at this year are even half as nice as this one.

The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. The room was very clean and the bathroom spotless. Would definitely stay again as it is very close to Boston Common and shopping etc.

<Content>Well-priced, friendly hotel I booked a trip to Boston at 1 day's notice in early February, so needed to book a hotel quickly. I looked at some of the reviews on Trip Advisor and as the reviews were good, I booked via the central Radisson website. I got a 'Hot Deal' for the weekend nights I was staying but even the weekday rate that followed was excellent for what I got in return. The Boston airport shuttles all drop off right in front of the hotel door where the bellboy at the hotel was right there to help me. The reception staff were excellent - friendly, easy-going and well-informed about my reservation. I was whisked effortlessly up to my room and was thrilled with it! 23rd floor, amazing view and absolutely HUGE! It was more like a suite than a room (sitting area, two televisions, coffee facilities). The only down-side was the bathroom was very small and there was no bath - only a shower cubicle - but I didnt request a change as I loved the rest of the room so much! The room was incredibly clean and the domestic staff must be magicians - the bathroom was sparkling every day, as were all the hotel communal areas, even the pool (which wasnt great, I have to admit, but served its purpose and is fine for a centrally located city hotel and a brief swim). What made my stay even better was that the hotel was so well located to everything I wanted to see, so I was able to pop back during the day when it got too cold outside - although it was difficult to leave in the mornings as it was so comfortable! Also a nice little theatre on the ground floor, so always people around and area felt safe, even at weekends when offices were closed.I didnt actually eat breakfast in the hotel restaurant (breakfast wasnt included in the price and I dont eat first thing) but I found a great food court right across the road (with a great clam chowder) but the prices I saw seemed reasonable, even for room service. Coffee machine in room was a great additiona too! There isnt a subway stop nearby, but I used cabs which are cheap in Boston (compared to London!) I walked a lot of places anyway.My checkout was equally effortless and the staff were great about leaving luggage, ordering me a shuttle for the airport and my bill.I really oved it here - it's not a glamourous or plush hotel, the lobby isnt impressive and it hasn't got a history like other Boston hotels, but I was on a budget and wanted somewhere central and it ticked all the boxes... and more. I loved Boston and the hotel made my stay even better. Id recommend the Radisson to anyone and everyone, especially families given the size of the rooms (although beware of the high balconies if you have small kids). And I am still dreaming of that stunning view!

<Content>Just perfect My partner and I stayed in Boston for almost a week and even though it was so cold -for us- the hotel made the difference. The king bed was like really KING size bed, the room big, with lot of space. We were on the 23rd floor and the view was beautiful. The security was excelent, even though I was like 8 thousand miles from home, I felt so good when I was going back to my hotel. Really quiet, perfect location, like one block away from the Boston Common-right across the hotel there are all these places to eat-. If I were to go back to Boston I would defenitely go to that hotel again. I have no pictures, but when I wen I'd seen pictures from the guestrooms, and I thought I was going to be disappointed...and... The rooms are way better that the pictures. Alicia

<Content>Nice Hotel, Nice Price and Location was ok I booked our flights and our hotel stay through the Radisson website and saved almost $400, compared through booking through the airline website. The room was fine, not fancy and we had a nice view of the Back Bay area. Very close to Boston Common, the exterior of the TV show Cheers and Beacon Hill. My only qualm was that it was a hike to the Faneuil Marketplace, waterfront and North End, where we spent most of our time. Thankfully, we had beautiful weather (low 70s and sunny) everyday that we were there and we didn't mind walking around.

<Content>Great Room with a View We stayed for the first time at this hotel at the end of December 2006 for four nights - we were travelling with our kids (aged 2 and 4) and we would highly recommend this hotel for families especially those with young children. The rooms were huge with an excellent view - we took advantage of a previous review and asked for a room on the upper floors. The room was very clean, especially the bathroom, and was serviced daily to a high standard.Its central location close to two T subway stations (Arlington and Boylston) meant that we could easily get around the city. Its a short walk to Downtown Crossing as well as to the shopping mall at Copley Square. The Boston Trolley tour also collects from the Hotel which is another plus and Boston Common, with space and a great playground, is a five minute walk away.There is also a food court across the road including a Starbucks which is handy for a snack and plenty of restaurants.The staff were very helpful and made us all feel very welcome especially in the Theatre Cafe at breakfast where crayons were provided for the kids! We also took advantage of room service for the kids meals in the evening. Service was prompt and food good. We didn't use the pool but it looked fine although the changing rooms were small.One minor concern was that the balcony doors could not be locked - a concern with inquisitive children!Overall I would recommend this hotel highly, especially for families.

<Content>once again, we had another great stay We stay at this hotel every year and always have a wonderful stay. The rooms are huge and always very clean. This year, just my wife and I traveled so we reserved a room with one king bed. We loved the adjustable bed. Also, it looks like the bathroom was brand new. All white and very clean. We always find the staff to be top notch, on top of their game, and ready to serve us. We won't stay anywhere else in Boston.

<Author>Bermudashorts19
<Content>A cautionary tale We recently stayed in this hotel for three nights during our first visit to Boston. We booked through expedia for convenience and the hotel portion of the vacation price meant our rate was $192 a night.Firstly the practical things everybody wants to know. We thought the room was of generous proportions, the furnishing were in good condition and housekeeping did a good job. We found the sleep number bed very uncomfortable though, it was as if it has been adjusted too many time and was full of lumps and bumps. We also had an extemely small bathroom, I could easily touch opposite walls simultaneously and it made for a very small bath. That said, it was a nice bathroom and I didn't dislike it.I didn't really like the public areas of the hotel, the reception was gloomy and the lifts were slow and nasty looking. However this is probably not a big deal as obviously we spent little time here.So why have I rated this terrible? This is service related and stems from the fact that I booked through Expedia. It seems that Radisson have a poor opinion of such guests and if you book through them you have to expect to be treated as a lower class of guest and a very low priority. When we booked our hotel, two months in advance I asked for a king room and certainly I assumed this was what I was booking. When we got to our room we found it was a twin but the Radisson staff pointed out that in the small print this was only a request and not guaranteed, indeed I found this was the case.But I did order two months in advance so I asked if this could be accommodated anyway and I also advised that this was our wedding anniversary. What followed was the most unbelievable outburst you can imagine. I was essentially told that I had booked via expeida so was a low priority guest and could not expect to be treated like other guests who had booked with them directly. I was told this by three members of staff independently and none of whom made any effort to explain the situation in any terms other than to make me feel like I was a parasite, the type that wants something for nothing and then has the cheek to complain! The third person even told me to call expedia and get them to find me another hotel if i didn't like it. Considering I had been nothing but polite and diplomatic, althought certainly assertive, this was an extraordinarily rude and unhelpful suggestion. Further I was told they always have this problem with people who have booked with Expedia or Hotels.com to boot. Well what problem exactly? That people who have paid $192 a night, which actually is NOT a cheap rate, would like to get the room they ordered. If they always refuse it then I am sure they always have this problem, but it is of their making and not the guests.So note to Radisson. This is the 21st century, get used to internet bookings and if you don't like guests who book through the internet then the answer is very simple, don't take them. And see the result in your annual Profit  Loss Account. But please don't accept guests and then treat them like unwanted guests.

<Content>Very good hotel in great location Stayed overnight just a month ago with a friend and our 2 teenage daughters. Came to Boston for a weekend of shopping (which is great, by the way). Very much enjoyed this comfortable and attractive hotel. Friendly front desk staff and concierge. The rooms are tastefully decorated (and obviously recently renovated) and have sleep number beds....very comfy. Nice bright bathroom, too. Used the small gym, which was ok, but served the purpose. Daughters used the indoor pool, which was convenient. Excellent location, within easy walk to many Boston attractions (Copley Square, Newbury St. shopping, theater district, restaurants). Weekend rate not bad for a big city hotel (at $246, was cheaper than most). Highly recommend and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Good base for a stop We stayed here on the return trip back to England. We previously stayed in the South End.The Hotel was a real find. It was very reasonable for the area. The Hotel was very well appointed and was very suited to the business traveller. The beds were very comfortable and you could adjust each side to hard or soft. We had a balcony and an amazing view of the City.We booked through Expedia and got free parking included for two days, which saved money.I did not like the Downtown area near the Hotel but the building is very central so you can easily get to Beacon Hill, the Park or South End. The only slight disappointment was the swimming pool which was in need of renovation. Paint was flaking off and made your skin go blue! Also it didn't look very clean. So we only had a brief swim! Otherwise a good location especially as it is in the Theatre District.

<Content>Loved the View and Attention from Staff We stayed four nights at this hotel and enjoyed every one of them. We requested an upper floor room away from the elevators. They accommodated us by putting us on the 22nd floor at the very end of the hall, as far away from the elevators as you can get. The room was quite large and all furnishings were very comfortable. The balcony outside our sliding glass doors afforded us a spectacular view of the area. We found we liked it better than the views we discovered from the 52nd floor of the Prudential Tower. A full-size closet to hang our clothes, a full length mirror, beds with adjustable firmness settings, an above-average bathroom, and a balcony made this a great place to stay. Even with all that, the thing that made our stay the most enjoyable was the bell staff. Immediately upon our arrival our bags were loaded up and delivered to our room. In my experience, usually you have to wait a bit for someone to be summoned to assist you. That was not the case here. At our departure, the bellhop quickly hailed us a cab and loaded our luggage even as he was busy assisting a group of about 20 with transportation. Any time we needed service from any department it was met with promptness, courtesy, and a smile. The location was also excellent as we were able to walk to shopping, eating, and tourist spots. It was also a pick up/ drop off point for the trolley, which is a great way to see the area, especially on a slightly rainy day. The only downsides were somewhat slow service in the Theatre Cafe restaurant and some noise from nearby room's plumbing and what we think was a storage closet next to our room.

<Content>Loved the Radisson Hotel Boston We loved our stay in the Radisson Hotel Boston. We followed the advise of other trip advisors and asked for a renovated room on a high floor. Our room was on the 24th floor and was very nice. It looked like it had been recently renovated. The view at night was fantastic. The staff was very helpful with suggestions on where to eat, etc. Also, the hotel is located one block from the Boston Common and the start of the Freedom Trail. When we booked our room, I paid for the rate that included the parking and the hot breakfast buffet. The hot breakfast buffet was very good and had a lot of selections. We parked our car when we arrived and never used it the whole time we were there. We either walked, rode the trolley, or caught a taxi. The trolley stops at the front door of the hotel which is another plus. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great View at Great Hotel Despite looking like a car-park from the outside this hotel was actually excellent. The staff were really friendly, and the room spacious with good facilities - particular praise for the bed which was excellent. The view from rooms high up is amazing. Location is good - 1 block from Boston Common and easy to walk to China Town, Financial District and the harbour.

<Content>Generally good We booked a basic room and it was good and spacey and the bathroom was good. Bed was excellent as you can adjust the hardness/softness on both sides! Breakfast was fine but pricey. We took into account other reviews on TripAdvisor and asked for a quiet room away from the elevators and got one, and it was quiet. Situation is good for theatres and not too far to walk to the T.Only downside was that a cleaner left our door unlocked after cleaning the room and the staff behind the desk were not that concerned.

<Content>Labor Day Weekend 2006 Stayed in this hotel on Friday, September 1st. Unfortunately for me, Saturday was not available.The hotel was great. It was located in the theater district within walking distance of just about every thing in Boston - so we never used our car. We booked through the hotel website as advised by someone in one of the reviews here on TripAdvisor and received the hotel, parking, and breakfast package. This turned out to be a better deal than I expected as the food and staff serving breakfast were professional and the food excellent. We were on the 23rd floor and our hotel room overlooked the Boston area and the Prudential tower. The concierge was able to get us a 20% discount on our dinner cruise tickets on the Odyssey. The $160 price for two for a cruise on Bostons Harbor along with a 4 course gourmet meal and dancing were great!I would recommend this hotel to all and will only stay at this hotel on future trips. From the staff to service and the clean, spacious, and elegant rooms.. this hotel gets 5 stars from me.

<Content>Fabulous rooms + beds - you will not leave anymore! We stayed at the Radisson for three nights with our three adolescent children. We all thouroughly enjoyed the very modern, spacious and relaxing rooms - and above all the number one bed, which are simply fabulous.From the outside the hotel is awful and we were quite shocked when we first arrived. Our impression of the lobby wasn't any better. But we were fully satisfied with the room on 17th and 23rd floor with great view + balcony. We would definitely stay there again. Breakfast for four (to pay for one child at the reasonable rate of about $ 7.--).

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Value, Great Location This was our first trip to Boston and we were a bit nervous about driving in the city as everything you read tells you not to drive in Boston. This hotel was not far off the highway and we booked the package that included parking and breakfast. We parked our car and didn't worry about it until we left the next day. We were told that we could leave the car in the garage up to 6 pm on check out day and had to bring the ticket to the hotel lobby to have it validated before we left. We ended up leaving our car parked there until 8pm and the ticket was validated without question and we didn't have to pay additional parking fees. The hotel is in an excellent location.We happend to be going to the Charles Play House to see the Blue Man Group (loved the show) and it was less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel. We walked to Quincy Market and the Prudential Center from the hotel and neither took more than 30 minutes. The Prudential was a bit closer than Quincy.... but the walk to Quincy was beautiful as you pass through the Boston Commons and so many beautiful buildings. The hotel room was very clean and the sleep number beds were comfortable. The bed linens are a very nice quality and they feel crisp and clean. We thought the room was a bit on the small side and the bathroom was small as well....but we didn't spend much time in the room, so it was fine. The concierge was very helpful and booked our tickets on the duck tour. I'm glad we paid the $2.50 fee to book ahead as you can only buy the tickets from the Prudential building the day of the tour. We saw signs early on in the afternoon saying the next available tour was for 6:30 that evening. We will most certainly return to the Radisson for future trips to Boston and would highly recommend it to all.

<Content>Great time and Most comfortable Beds Just got back from staying at this hotel and we enjoyed the Radison Hotel a great deal. My family of 4 including 2 teenagers ,were impressed with the hotel and the wonderful comfort number beds. These were the most comfortable beds we have ever slept on and the bed linen was very nice too. Everything was clean and the staff was helpful. We would stay at this hotel again if in Boston. The location was good and the parking garage (included in the room package) was very convient. So we were able to walk or take the tour trolly and didn't have to use the car.

<Content>Great hotel and location for young families I concur with the previous reviews on the Sleep Number bed - it is delicious! I never sleep well in hotels however this bed was different. The duvet and linens were high quality. I chose this hotel for the location but also the room had two queen beds - most hotels have one king or two doubles. For two adults and two children, I wanted to make sure everyone slept well. The room is large compared to most hotel rooms.Location was great, a few blocks from Boston Common. The area around the hotel was fine - theaters, restaurants (Legal Seafoods -highly recommend, Starbucks, Rock Bottom and of course Dunkin Donuts) and we felt safe at night. Boston is so easy to walk around to see the sights, we only used the T a few times. The hotel has a few stops within 5-10 minutes walk.The only downpoints are the pool and bathroom size. The pool is freezing cold - hard to swim with my kids. However they provide warm thick towels. It was hard for two people to use the bathroom at once. However, the bathtub was quite deep and the hotels and robe were very nice.Overall, great hotel. Also, we had a AAA rate and I noticed a few days before we arrived the rate went down. I called the hotel and they honored the new lower rate.

<Content>Great Location  We stayed in Boston for two nights recently, and I was very happy with the Radisson Hotel Boston. The most important things for us in this search was location and parking. Having never been to Boston, and hearing lots of stories about the traffic, we wanted to be in the thick of things and able to walk the city.The Radisson is in heart of the theater district, which is also pretty central to the entire city. It's location was great, for everything we did. We weren't more than a 10-15 minute walk from all the major food and touristy things. But the thing to really make it great was that we didn't have to worry about our car and parking too much. We found the hotel, and parked, and that was it! The room rate that I got included the parking fee - which can run you around $20 bucks a day at a public/private garage, or even on the street (but good luck finding that one). We got a rate of $199 a night off of their website, Internet rate deals, the package included the parking. Great deal - for Boston prices and parking. I did a lot of searching, and you can get a better deal if you go to a place that doesn't include parking, and is a little bit more out of the way - maybe 165 or so....Having a toddler and wanting to not worry about the parking situation - the extra money was well worth it to me.The room we stayed in was newly renovated, seemed brand new to me. Fresh , clean , brand new fixtures in the bathroom. The room had 2 of those new Select Comfort beds which was a nice bonus. The sheets were soft and comfortable, cotton and not that weird polyester bed spread that most hotels have as a standard. Down comforter to boot, and a balcony that looked out into the city. The pool and gym were adequate, we got some decent time in during the dinner time hour when most people were out. The only thing that was a little difficult was that they have a set of hotel elevators, and separate parking garage elevators. We couldn't figure out if they connected or not - the problem was there were a few stairs to manuever up/down with our luggage, stroller, and toddler...so it was a little bit inconvenient, but definitely not any kind of show stopper.We had a great time in Boston, and would definitely stay at the Radisson again!

<Content>Great hotel I spent a lot of time reading reviews and looking at prices in the Boston area. The Radisson was reasonably priced for the city--it's an incredibly expensive place to stay--and in a great location. It has good reviews on this site as well. It did not disappoint. The room is nicely sized and the bed is comfortable. It had a balcony and provided an excellent view. I requested a high floor and away from the elevator and my requests were honored. It is a quiet, clean and well kept hotel. There are several restaurants within a block and there's a Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts half a block away. The T subway is a block away as well. I really enjoyed my stay.

<Content>Happy With the Radisson The room was very clean and comfortable and equipped with a sleep number bed and hi-speed internet. We had a great view from our 23rd floor balcony. We stayed here 3 nights and were happy with the nearby restaurants. The pool and exercise area were less than expected but we were so busy being tourists that we didn't have time for them anyway. Lots of outdoor sunning area on the roof. Parking here is less expensive than in neighboring parking lots. We were quite happy at the Radisson and would recommend it.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised Stayed at the Radisson in Boston on Stuart St. one night in March. Kinda expected it to be a typical chain hotel, but it was actually very clean and elegant. The front desk staff was extremely friendly  helpful. Stayed in a good-sized room with a balcony that offered a decent view of the city. Located right in the theater district and near the Boston Common and also near a lot of fantastic restaurants.

<Content>Radison rules Boston is a great, repeat, great town! We walked, rode the trolley, used the T and had a wonderful time. The Radison was great- good staff, nice comfortable room- very clean; beds were comfy (Sleep # beds are good we have one at home) Ate at Legal seafood across the street and then at PF Chaings nearby. Ate breakfast at hotel one morning- $8.95 for eggs, muffin, bacon and coffee! Also got Dunkin Donuts down the street one AM. If you like Dunkin there are over 100 in the city. Overall can't say a bad thing stay here and you will be happy!

<Content>Great location From the outside, the hotel looks a bit shabby. It is sandwiched between 2 wings of a car park. Ignore this. Inside the hotel is what you would expect from a Radisson Hotel. The staff were couteous and helpful when we needed them. The room was excellent and very easily accomodated 2 adults and a teenager. The Location is what makes this hotel. It is beside Boston Common, on the edge of the Theatre District and China Town and just a short walk from Newbury Street.The only downside was the pool. It is very poor and felt undermaintained. But then we did not go for the pool.

<Content>GREAT HOTEL, WONDERFUL LOCATION, FANTASTIC VIEWS Arrived at this hotel after travelling for over 12 hours from Scotland. We were greeted by very friendly staff who were very welcoming. The reception staff even had time to talk to my two young children and tell them how to go about getting free ice cream from the hotel, this was a big hit on arrival, instantly we had 2 happy children. We were given a wonderful room with amazing views of the Charles River and the city of Boston. The beds in the room were the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in, were just what we needed after a long trip. We used the hotel,s garage which cost $25 per night and had free valet parking (which we did not use), we managed to park our own car and find it again with no problems at all . There are two restaurants for breakfast one of which is more casual, continental breakfast which we used and were happy with. The only complaint I could find about this hotel was that the pool was slightly cool but still enjoyable. We stayed here for our scheduled 2 nights then moved on to continue our itinery. Unfortunately one of our next hotels was sodreadful that we decided to return to the Royal Sonesta and enjoyed another 2 nights here. Would recommend this hotel and would return any time.

<Content>Best location in Boston . Stayed here last year (on my own ) and came back for another 6 nights this year (with my spouse). Definitely my hotel of choice in Boston . The room was very spacious - we benefited from getting the room that tucks in behind the elevator and this results in large room . This gives great space and we had no noise issues whatsoever. It would seem the bathroom did not benefit from the same facelift as the room. While the bathroom was still OK, it could use extra shelf space and finishes could be updated. Contact with the staff was minimal but bell captains were about the best I've seen -very helpful but not intrusive. One nice feature was the general activity in the lobby, always a few people around but almost always quiet enough so that it felt relaxing and never rushed as so many large hotels feel. Security staff were around but again never intrusive and card access was required to sleeping floors after 11pm (nice feature). The sleep number bed and the linen were very nice indeed as were the robes. What is really great is the location for a reasonable (for downtown Boston) price. This is the best location (in my view)in Boston -about 2 minutes from Boston Common and a reasonable walk to Back Bay, Beacon Hill, Quincy Market. Also the Boylston subway stop(Green line) is a 4-5 minute walk -a good way to/from airport. Good range of restaurants in the area from Bennigans to upscale Bonfire. If you want to stay in something a tad fancier then the Park Plaza and the 4 Seasons are a stone's throw away. We walked by many other hotels noted in these reviews but weighing all aspects , we had no second guesses and would return

<Content>Excellent staff, Great location My wife and I had planned our trip to Boston to coincide with the 4th of July celebrations. We arrived at the 鈥楻adisson Hotel Boston鈥?on the 3rd July after a long day travelling from Memphis, only to be told that they didn鈥檛 have a non-smoking room available for us, but that we could walk across the street to the Park Plaza where they would put us up instead for that night (unfortunately not for both nights). We could then check back in to the Radisson as soon as we leave the Plaza the next day, and we can also have complementary breakfast. So armed with the prospect of a free meal in the morning, we checked in at the Park Plaza for one night.I couldn't complain too much as I had booked the hotel trough Priceline (which does not guarantee the room type). Nevertheless the young lady at the desk offered us a junior suite for the inconvenience for our second night. They locked our luggage away after we took our overnight bags with us.We checked out of the Park Plaza the next day and walked across to the Radisson, where we were told that they didn鈥檛 have a room ready for us yet鈥?So off we went for our free breakfast (which was lunch by this time) and by the time we finished, the room was ready. They gave us a nice Junior Suite, which was very pleasant. The 'Sleep number' beds are quite good - much better than any of the other hotel beds we had on our trip.The concierge was very helpful, arranging a rental car (Dollar) to be brought to the hotel and allowing us to return it at our next hotel when we god back from Cape Cod in a few days time (the Royal Sonesta - excellent hotel, see my other review). He was very sympathetic when we told him that we were awoken at 6:45 in the morning by a fire alarm at the Park Plaza and he arranged for us to have complementary breakfast the following day.There are a number of good restaurants within a short walking distance of the hotel and it is close to the 'T' so transport is good too. The bell men were very friendly and helpful, as were the Daytime frontdesk supervisor and the restaurant staff. If you must stay in the theatre district then I can certainly recommend it. Boston is not a cheap place to stay at but you can make significant savings like we did, but beware when booking through the opaque services (Priceline  Hotwire) as they never guarantee the room type. This is the first time we ever had problems with rooms booked that way, but the 4th of July was probably the reason.

<Content>Excellent Experience! I spent a week at the Boston Radisson recently as part of a conference i was attending. As part of this yearly conference, i have had some extraordinarily poor experiences in chain hotels and often cringe at the thought of what awaits. From the moment i called to make my reservations, i had the feeling that this was going to be a better experience. The reservation person was warm, friendly, conversational and seemed to be genuinely iterested in my reservation and experience in Boston.Check in was smooth as silk, and even a promised in-room refrigerator was there with out having to make another call. And the beds... I don't think i have ever slept so well in a hotel. They are sleep number beds as advertised on TV. They were heavenly!The staff was top notch. Every employee spoke to us as we waited for elevators or passed by. A nod and good morning with a genuine smile but how refreshing!! The bell captains grabed doors and assisted with steps without even a look - all with a smile and wave. As i said, we planned a conference for this hotel and the event coordinating staff were exceptionally helpful and proactive. The meal in the banquet room was the best i've ever had in a banquet setting and served quickly and professionally. As i was leaving the banquet room, struggling with a load of papers and books, one of the staff approached and offered to take it to my room. I wrote down my room number and he started to walk off without even waiting for a tip! (Of course, i chased him down and rewarded his thoughtfulness.)If i HAD to say anything derogatory, it would be that the bathroom didn't have enough shelf space. Also, having such a great experience is going to make it very difficult for other hotels to please me in the future!!!Without hesitation, i would recommend this hotel for a convenient, pleasant stay in a Great American City!

<Content>A very nice experience On the heels of some very disappointing lodging during a road trip in the northeast, this was a very pleasant experience. This is precisely what one should be able to expect from a metropolitan hotel affiliated with a leading brand name. The location is great, the restaurants nearby are numerous and the facility is very nice. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Good Location, Easy Access My family (husband, 2 children - 119) and I stayed at the Radisson from June 18 through June 22 - 4 nights. We had a room on the 15th floor facing West which was a view of the Prudential Tower and John Hancock building. If staying at this hotel request a high floor (above 14) with a West view. The balcony was very nice and the children liked to go out and watch over the pool area and also read. Overall the best thing about this hotel is the location. We were able to walk to the Boston Commons, Chinatown, the T and we actually walked to Quincy Market  Faneuil Hall one day. The walk to Quincy Market took about 15-20 minutes, but it was a very leisurely pace down Stuart to Tremont, then one block over to Washington. Washington is a major shopping area with the renowned Filene's Basement. From Washington, take a right on Court/State Street and you can see Quincy Market.The other great thing about this hotel is the pool. There are not many hotels in Boston that have a pool and although this one is not outside the rooftop deck area provide plenty of light in the pool area. We used the pool every afternoon for about 2 hours in between morning tours and dinner plans.During our stay we went on the Duck Tour, which was entertaining, however I won't do this again. The last time we were in Boston we did the trolley tour which was much better because you were able to get off at various locations and then reboard. If your Con'duck'tor on the duck tour is not entertaining, then the ride is not that much fun. The kids were really bored after the initial splash down into the water.We also toured Fenway Park. This is a must do even if you are not a baseball fan. This was probably the best bang for the buck - $12/adult. You get to sit in the green monster seats and in the press box. One evening for dinner we went to the North Shore (Italian area). We took the T to the Haymarket station and then we got lost! The concierge did not mention how to get to the area once you got off the T. So we started out in the wrong direction, stopped somebody on the street and then found our way over to Hanover street. What a choice of restaurants. There are so many it is really difficult to choose. There was one place called Giacomo's (sp?) that we stopped at because there were a lot of people standing outside. When we asked how long the wait, the one guy told us that he lived around the corner and that this was the best place on the block. He said they tell everyone 20 minutes, but even if it is 40 minutes, it is worth the wait. Unfortunately for us, it was already 7:40 and the kiddos were hungry so we couldn't wait. If you go, please place a review to let us know if you liked it!Back to the room- the room was a decent size for a family of 4. We weren't in the room that much so it never got too small. The bathroom was adequate. The counter was really low, I'm 5'7 and It only came up mid-thigh. I felt like I was really bending to wash my face. Also, the counter surface was very old. There was a hair dryer and a small coffee maker, but we made a Dunkin Donuts run every morning for coffee - there is DD across the street (and it seems like one on every corner in Boston - they have the BEST coffee). What we found is that if you leave $5 on your first day for the housekeeper you get pretty good service for the week. We did leave more on our last day, but I think it always helps to leave a little something in the beginning of the stay.Hope this was helpful. Enjoy your trip to Boston.

<Content>Spacious room But Terrible Noise from Elevator I had stayed at Radisson Boston two years before and had just a happy memory.So I decided on Radisson without hesitation.I stayed for 2 nights this time. I stayed at 5 hotels during my trip in USA and it was the 3rd hotel.On arrival, the female staff greeted me brightly.'Welcome back' She was smiling, which made me pleased.I don't understand why some of the hotel staffs are so stingy with smile.This time the room with one king bed was more spacious than the previous room with two queen beds,but the bathroom was too small, which embarrassed me.Maybe its peculiar floor plan was due to the location next to the elevator.Anyway it was bearable because we got more room instead.The bigger problem was NOISE!!!It prevented us from sleeping till midnight.At first we thought the noise was from the A/C,so turned it off. After a process of trial and error,we realized that the elevator was mailnly responsible for the noise.I always ask for a quiet room when booking a hotel room.'a quiet room with a good view on the high floor'Did I miss 'quiet'?? Or Did the king bed cause the trouble?The biggest problem was the unfriendly attitude of the staff,which is unimaginable in high level hotels in Korea, my country.When I checked out, the staff looked so indifferent.I had experienced the same two years before when check-out.However I had understand to an extent because of my early check-out time.The door man was unkind at first and helped us carry our bags into the taxi later.I had sent an e-mail about my mileage accumulation soon after coming back from my trip 2 years ago. I had got no reply.They are not attentive at all.Actually I got help from the lady who was at reservation desk.I asked her where to get off on subway to reach my destinationand she answered kindly. I wanted to watch a famous musical in the evening,but being too tired to get out of the hotel room, gave it up at last.Pros: neat  tidy(room, linens, pillows, bathroom) , good view, internet,  ...... enough room, location( near Boston Common and T-station), newspaperCons: attitude of the staff, noise from the elevator, noise from the A/C, ...... balcony's dirt

<Content>Great Hotel in Theater District Recently stayed 5 days at the Radisson on Stuart St in Boston. Hotel staff were extremely pleasant, rooms were great, and even the restaurant had great food. We got the package that included parking and a full buffet breakfast which was worth every penny! We were in the theater district, a block from the Commons, not far from the T, and right across the street from a Legal Seafoods! What more could we ask? This hotel is also fairly easy to access from the interstates. Will definitely add it to our list of places to return to.

<Content>Great location , bit pricey this is a a hotel with a great location. rooms are spaciuos and have great facilities. It is a bit pricey if you book direct with the hotel but if you book via a booking agent such a octopus and expedia its good value. We booked the first 3 nights through the internet and the last night direct with the hotel and the price difference was considerable. however they have a nice bar/restuarant/lobby area and a great outdoor area at the bar so its great to sit on the terrace of an evening with a glass of wine and take in Boston. I would definatley recommend this hotel, but take my advice and book through an agent!

<Content>Great rooms, below average staff. I stayed here with three friends (all 22-24 years old). Although we are a very respectful group, the staff treated us like 10 year olds. When I returned home, I wrote a letter complaining about the staff and they did give us a hefty credit to our accounts. We all appreciated their willingness to correct their mistake.The rooms were great! Very clean and comfortable. Every room has a great view with a balcony. We had a great time despite the staff.I would stay here again!

<Content>Another Great Stay at the Radisson Boston! I just returned from my semiannual trip to the Radisson Boston and once again I had a great stay. As usual, the staff was friendly, accommodating, and efficient. The location of the hotel is great, close to tons of restaurants and a quick walk to everything Boston has to offer. They must have remolded some of the bathrooms (mine was brand new) and replaced the beds (I got one of those Sleep Number Beds) since my last visit. The bathroom was great and the lines on the bed were a nice upgrade. As other reviewers have stated, the furniture and wallpaper is getting a bit tired and it鈥檚 time to replace them鈥opefully, they will do this soon. Either way, I鈥檒l be back鈥his hotel can鈥檛 be beat!

<Content>What a great find I just got back from a college trip with my two sons. The Radisson was wonderful. The room was very nice, extremly clean and very comfortable. The bathrooms were brand new and lovely. The hotel was very well located and the staff was very efficient. This hotel was very well priced. We all had breakfast and were able to park our car with our room which was priced at $209. I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel and I would stay again and again! I'm very picky about hotels and have stayed at some of the best. No complaints here!

<Content>Great location, Good hotel We just spent a week at the Radisson. Great location. The beds (sleep number beds)and linen are fabulous. Our bedroom seemed half renovated though (ie new beds, linen and decorations but really old bathroom, shower and wall paper). We had specifically requested a room far from the elevators and construction area (based on comments read on this site) and we were graciously accomodated. The room (on the 15th floor) was quiet and cozy.We got a good price for this room by booking through the internet (Radisson website) ... especially with parking being included!Again, location was ideal for us. Walking distance from 2 T stations and from most interesting districts. Also close to the Esplanade where you can run along the Charles River.

<Content>Watch your car!!!! The room was satisfactory, but valet parking was included with my room, and my car was obviously rifled through (glove compartment, ashtray). Beware when valet parking at this hotel. The hotel was not at all helpful when I complained. They don't seem to care who they employ.

<Content>Great location! Number one factor for a hotel for me is location, which for the Radisson was excellent. Just 2 blocks to a T stop, right near Boston Common  theater district. We paid a very reasonable price for a huge room (double room = 2 queen size beds) that we used for 4 people with plenty of space. The bathroom was spotless and fair sized. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast at the cafe (not cheap, but good). This hotel was an excellent value for its location and quality.

<Content>NOISE! Whilst staying at the Radisson we were pleased until we were woken at 8am by drilling in our roof. Apparently the hotel is undergoing renovations until May 2006, but they are still keeping most of the hotel open. This may result in you having to put up with tremendous noise during your stay.This is a nice hotel, but avoid until they have finished renovations because they will put you right under the floors they are working on!

<Content>Even Better We have stayed in the Radisson several times but this time it was even better. The refurbished rooms are brighter and the beds which were good are now the best hotel beds we have ever had. Huge and extra comfortable with brilliant linens and pillows. The hotel was quiet at this time of year and staffing levels were lower than usual.Great position for Boston Common, Theatre District, Backbay. Downtown is walkable if you like walking.

<Content>terrible room next to elevator The hotel is nice and clean, has large rooms and the remodelled rooms are quite nice.JUST DON'T ACCEPT ONE NEXT TO THE ELEVATOR.We stayed in room 2320 and it should be against the law to rent this room.Loud, vibrating rumblin noises ALL NIGHT go right through the walls. NO SLEEP FOR US.Yes, the obvious solution would be to request another room, but we did not realize we had the noise until we got in after 10 PM and settled down to bed....who wanted to move then?I am still in my room writing this and plan to refuse to pay for the room....I'll see what happens :(

<Content>Awful service! When my husband and I stayed at the Radisson over spring break, we were treated very poorly. There was a bag of merchandise taken from my room and never recovered. The front desk and security were not kind and not accomodating. They never followed up on the incident and called me a liar when I tried to follow up with them. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Loved this hotel! Loved the concierge! We stayed at the Radisson Nov. 11-13th and this hotel is fabulous. The rooms are spacious and clean with outrageous beds and bedding. The bathrooms are newly renovated and very mod. The locations is central to everything and the hotel staff was more than helpful and friendly. We got a room that backed up to the elevator and it sounded like a rollercoaster, and when I called for a new room they moved us across the hall and over one room within minutes. We were moved in less than 10 minutes and with no hassle what-so-ever! The most wonderful part of our stay was the CONCIERGE, JOHN HALLETT! He recommended ALL of our restaurants, shows and tours and never once steered us wrong. He chose everything according to our likes and dislikes and he was right on the money! He was attentive, interested and most importantly he became like a friend to my husband and I! Make sure you ask for John if you stay, he will send you to all the right places!Frank and Leslee Ent

<Content>Excellent We stayed at the Radisson on Stuart Street in Boston in November 2005. The room was beautiful and I am never comfortable in hotel rooms. The bathroom was very modern and clean. The bed was amazing - with the softest sheets and a down comforter with duvet. When we checked out the bellhop gave us great directions (they were typed up and we were able to take them with us) and a map of the area that was helpful. Overall a great great visit!

<Content>Beautifully renovated rooms My daughter and I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Boston Radisson. The rooms have been very recently renovated and they are wonderful. They have used white comforter covers on the beds, and the beds are Sleep Number beds. It's the first time I've ever felt that the bed covers were immaculate. The bathrooms have been renovated in a spa style, all white, with stylish brushed chrome fixtures and a rain shower shower head. A white spa robe is provided, also. The room was quite spacious, and all these things combined with a terrific location in the Theater District made it perfect for us. An added bonus was that on our last night we went to see the musical Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat, and when we returned to the hotel we rode the elevator to our room with the cast from the show. They were staying at the Radisson, too!

<Content>Nice hotel, good location Stayed here for three nights. The room was large, had a balcony, and was very clean. Location was good...T stop was a few blocks away as was Boston Common. Was able to walk to Faneuil Hall and to Newberry Street (about a fifteen minute walk to each). Agree with another reviewer that the bathroom needs updating. Our shower had hardly any water pressure. Several restaurants are near by...Legal Seafood, Fleming's, Maggiano's, Smith and Wollensky. Would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Nice room with good view We stayed in a single room on the 18th floor and had a beautiful view of the west side of the city. The hotel is very close to the Boston theater district, Boston Commons, and the Public Gardens. The room was good size, very clean, and quiet. There are some good restaurants around the hotel, including two small pubs up Tremont street and a McCormick and Scmicks across the street. We booked and prepaid for our room through Orbitz for $179.00 and the front desk staff made a big deal about having to take a credit card deposit in case of damages since the room was already paid for (what that was about, I have no idea). Aside from the somewhat snippy front desk person, the overall experience was a positive one.

<Content>Great Location..Large rooms..Wonderful staff We stayed in Boston 3 nights at what was to be the beginning of a 10 day trip to New England. The ONLY things not great about the hotel was the bathroom which was dated. The room was big, for a Boston Hotel and clean. Easy check in....helpful staff...within walking distance of EVERYTHING. Local Seafoods is directly across the street....a whole food court is one block east. The main car rental venue is across the street as well. Boston Commons is two blocks away. We walked to the waterfront and back easily. The pick up site for Trolley tours is directly in front.The night of our last stay, we walked to a great restaurant (Laurel Grill) and on the way home I tripped and cut my knee...requiring an emergency room visit and 10 stitches. The staff at the hotel were MOST helpful...got us a wheelchair...told the cabbie where to go...helped us back to the room when we returned....and gave us a VERY late check out the next day since our flight home (RATS) was at 6PM and I wasn't feeling great. We would certainly stay here again, and would gladly recommend this to all our friends. Best of all, we had gotten a great rate!

<Content>Beautiful view Stayed at the Radisson Hotel Boston for 2 nights - Aug 22  23. We were on the 16th floor. The view from our balcony was spectacular. The room was very clean (no stains on the carpet), the beds were comfortable and the housekeeping staff was very thorough. We also noticed how quiet the hotel room was at night - no slamming of doors, loud voices, etc. There was a pool/fitness room and sundeck on the 9th floor. Didn't use the pool, but it looked nice. The sundeck was pretty - again with another beautiful view of the city. The hotel was just what we needed it to be - it was close to everything. The perfect location to get anywhere in the city. There are many places within walking distance to eat, so we didn't eat at the hotel restaurant which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. We took a trolley tour - purchased the tickets from the concierge - which was great. The tickets were $37 each (adult rate) and it was worth it. The trolley stops right outside the door of the hotel every 15 minutes or so. We were able to see much more of the city than we would have in 2 days on foot. I would recommend leaving your car in the parking facility at the hotel (the first 5 or so floors are actually the parking lot which is an additional $28 per day) and walking or taking public transportation. The T (subway) is very closeby and there are plenty of taxis and busses. I would definitely stay at the Radisson again. It made our visit to Boston a wonderful experience.

<Content>Rooms fit for a king Stayed with my 13-year old for three days in mid-August. The reviews seemed up and down for this place; we got the up experience. Actually enjoyed the location, near the Boston Commons, and not too far to walk to other attractions. Other than arriving early morning and not being able to check in until 3 (at 2:30 they said, It's not 3 yet. Ughh), everything else was great. The rooms were huge, the beds perfect, nicely furnished, a great bathroom with all the amenities, a daily morning paper, and balconies in every room! Ours overlooked the John Hancock Tower and old rooftops throughout the city. Wonderful. One big reason we stayed there (believe it or not) was that they had a swimming pool. When it's hot and sometimes humid, this certainly comes in handy, and it did). An indoor pool, with some workout facilities. Can't beat that to break up a day of sightseeing.

Very quiet, we didn't here people above us or walking in the hallways. Also, did not hear traffic outside. It is in a great location, close to public gardens and right across the street from Legal Seafoods which is always a treat!The staff was friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel,Great Location,Clean Room!! We stayed here for 2 nights and had 3 rooms for our family. We had the 14th and 12th floors. Rooms were very fresh smelling and clean. Spotless...I had read negative reviews a day or two before our stay but was pleasantly surprised by friendly staff, excellent location and easy access to everything!!! I have a 14 month old child and was comfortable with him on the floor the carpet was brand new, crib was very nice too. Port a crib, not a pack and play. The breakfast staff didn't speak English and our to go order got a little mixed up but the blueberry pancakes were fresh (berries) and delicious!!! Highly recommend!!!

<Content>Great location, would most certainly stay again. Stayed here: 3 july 2005 - 5 july 2005The hotel is easy to find coming from the highway, and the city center is easy to reach by foot or taxi. The hotel is a large concrete block, but it's about the inside, which is great.Checking in only took minutes, while the car got parked in the garage next door. ($26/24hrs).The room was large and well equipped, the beds were large and we had a nice balcony viewing Boston's skyline from the 21st floor. Everything was clean and working fine.There also was a nice pool and a fitness area which were free to use, the vending machines were cheap which you wouldn't expect from a hotel like this.For $100 a night (priceline) this was a great deal. The place is really worth more money. A great way to experience Independance Day. I would really stay here again, so should you!

<Content>Perfect hotel for a perfect stay Me and my girlfriend stayed here for three nights, during our first visit to Boston. And I must say, we couldn't have stayed in a better hotel.The location is perfect: close to the park and the district with cinemas, restaurants and bars. We didn't have a car and you don't need one in Boston. Public transport is nearby!The room was very clean and big, very clean bathroom and a lot of TV channels. We were not used to this luxury, as in Europe I think standards are different.Also the service was good: very friendly staff and they are happy to give you tips.Next time we will defenitely go back!!

<Content>good Location. costly Parking I stayed in this hotel in July. The location was good as indicated by other reviewers. The drainage in bathroom was an irritating problem. I was put up in 21st floor. It would not work. That negates all other positive aspects of the hotel. Be informed about 28$ overnight parking charge. This hotel is located next to Arlington subway station. Close to attractions.While checking out, I tried to use the TV service and it will not work. Its ok as you can go to the front lobby. It is good for a day or two stay.

<Content>Yikes! Just returned from a tour with my youth symphony, which included a stay at the Boston Radisson. There were some early problems, such as a somewhat uncooperative front desk staff and a consistent drainage problem in bathrooms above the 14th floor (one room that reported a drainage problem ended up with black scum covering the better part of their bathroom after the engineering crew 'blew out the pipes.' They had to clean it up themselves!) Actually, the bathrooms left something to be desired overall (chipped tile, countertops that pooled water instead of draining it, and so forth.) However, my group faced a very serious dilemma the morning we were scheduled to leave. Two of the four elevators for the hotel (which has 24 floors) were out of commission. I had students trapped on the 16th floor, unable to access an elevator for over an hour. When I phoned the front desk to ask them about the situation, their initial reply was We've dedicated two of our elevators to a group of 90 who are checking out... Since we WERE the group of 90, I knew this was a fabrication! Things really turned ugly when some of the students decided to take the stairs, only to find that the stairwells were locked-down on the 9th floor. If there had been a fire, I shudder to think of what would have happened. When this was brought to the attention of the Radisson, their (weak) reply was... Well, if there was a fire the doors would automatically unlock... which, frankly, no one believed given the variety of mechanical failures we observed during our stay. Needless to say, I would never stay at this hotel again, and sincerely hope that other groups and tour providers will heed this warning ---

<Content>Great Room! Great Location! Great room! Newly rennovated, very large, 2-Queen size beds with plenty of room for 2 portable cribs. Great Location! Walking distance to just about everything, Publics Gardens (Swan Boats), Boston Commons, Fannueil Hall, Quincy Market, Duck Tours. Good price, although parking was extra. Friendly staff that was helpful in suggesting kid-friendly activities and making reservations. Would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Nice Hotel Stayed here one night for business, and I was happy with my choice. The doors and hallway carpets are a bit dated, but the rooms are nicely furnished, and it was very nice to have a balcony and have access to fresh outside air, as others have mentioned. The fitness center has a couple of treadmills, bikes, and free weights, with two TVs, but it is located in an enclosed room next to the pool, and it gets VERY hot and humid in there. Also, there is no drinking water available in the pool/fitness center area. Hotel staff were cordial and helpful. Location was terrific, too, with nice views of the city, and it's nice to have theater as an entertainment option. Do yourself a favor and sample some of the terrific independent restaurants in the neighborhood - no need to visit chains such as Bennigan's, Legal Seafood, and Maggiano's when there are better options nearby.

<Content>Could have been better We spent a weekend at the Radisson and found that the hotel was average but our room was definitely below average. The bedspreads were faded and worn and the carpets were filthy with ground-in stains and bleach-marks. The bathroom floor was dirty and there were a few ants present to greet us upon our arrival. The staff was friendly, however, and reasonably knowledgeable. We would not stay there again.

<Content>Great location in Beantown Stayed here May for one night on May 7 and it was a good night. We were supposed to go to the Sox game but it was rained out so we went to the doubleheader game the next day. It was raining and windy all day yet we still were able to walk around Boston and enjoyed it very much. The beds and room were beautiful and the view of the park, FleetCenter (or Derek Jeter Center), and the whole Financial District. I will come back next time in Boston.

<Content>Had a really nice stay We were upgraded to a junior suite, and we had unbelievable views of Boston Common, the State House and the Boston skyline. We spent a good deal of time on the balcony (all rooms have balconies), taking in the lights and the spectacle of late-night revellers mingling with the theater crowds into the early morning hours. It wasn't a problem for us because we're up late anyway, but the endless cacophony of car horns and sirens might be problematic for light sleepers.Location is ubeatable here. Very close to the Common, Beacon Hill and Copley Place, with Chinatown (the best late-night dining option in the city) a mere three blocks away. You can just park your car in the garage ($17/ night) and leave it for the weekend-- a nice option, because driving in Boston is a nightmare.The bed in our suite was luxurious, with nice plump pillows and a new mattress. The bathroom was on the small side, but no big deal. Desk staff and concierges were friendly and quick with suggestions. Decent pool. So-so lobby. Room decor uninspired but unobtrusive. For under $200-- particularly because we were upgraded to a suite-- we felt we got a very good deal for our money.

<Content>Great Deal...Great Room...Nice View My sister and I brought my niece to Boston for her 16th birthday. We stayed at the Radisson and what a surprise when we saw the room. It was relatively spacious, comfortable, and presented a wonderful view overlooking the city. We got a great deal at $105 through an online service and we were not disappointed - we got a true bargain for the location and quality. We would stay here again without hesitation. If there is a downside, it is the somewhat antiquated bathroom. It was a typical for hotels bathroom. I have stayed at hotels with luxurious bathrooms; however, this would not be a deterrent since it was clean.

<Content>Ignore the Hideous Exterior of the Radisson This is an unspectacular hotel, but it is well located and the rooms are large -they all seem to have been refurbished recently. I paid $135 a night through quikbook and would certainly stay there again at that sort of price.

<Content>Nice I stayed at the Raddisson for two nights. The views are wonderful. Every room has a little balcony you can step out on. The location is excellent. Its in the theatre district. One block away from Bosoton Commons, Chinatown, trains, eateries, bars. As you can guess the area is busy, but very well worth the stay. Had a good rate. I would stay here again when in Boston!I'm a New Yorker so the Raddisson was strictly judge by my daughter and I!

<Content>everything you need stayed for 4 nights from the 10th March. Location good but not the best for the city attractions but this did not affect our trip. Plenty of bars and restaurants nearby. Staff extremely courteous and helpful, room clean and sheets changed on a daily basis, furnishings were nice. Bathroom was looking a little 'tired' but the hotel is undergoing refurbishment at the moment (this did not affect our stay at all). Only complaint I have, (and it is a very, very minor one, and something we have encountered at other hotels), is the air con/heating system was very noisy when it cut in and it continually woke us up the first couple of nights of our stay until we got used to it. If the price was right we would stay here again as the hotel has everything you need.

<Content>Radisson Theater District - Don't bother! I stayed here for three nights in March of 2003 and it was a terrible experience from start to finish. When we arrived to our room there was a rotten egg smell in it. Every morning we were awakened by construction. The day we were leaving the valet pulled our vehicle up with a busted rear window. The hotel claimed no responsibility for the vehicle damage claiming it is a public garage where they park the hotel guests' cars. After asking for the staff's assistance to tape the window for us because we had a 6 hour drive home, they placed a garbage bag over the window with a piece of masking tape, it was a pathetic attempt. I would never stay at this hotel ever again. Terrible service, room and location.

Every hotel I stay in is rated against this one - Yeah it was good, but not a good as the Radisson Boston. An absolute delight, can't recommend highly enough.

<Content>A bit costly, but not bad overall The positives: the location is good, the views can be very nice (I had a view of Boston Common), my room had a nice balcony, which meant I could open the window. That's always a plus to me, as I don't like to use air-conditioning in most hotels; it's usually full of mold and aggravates my allergies.The room decor leaves a lot to be desired. The rooms are dark and rather dingy. The beds are adequate and the rooms adequately equipped. They have above-average toiletries. The coffee provided isn't particularly good and the coffeemaker is itsy-bitsy.The soundproofing's not too bad, but you do hear a bit too much of people passing in the hallways and doors slamming, which I hate. They accommodated my request for a high floor, quiet room (I request that in every hotel). The coffee shop is above average.The service varies wildly depending on who you get. I'd requested early check-in because I was flying in sleepless on a red-eye, and this was not accommodated; in fact, I couldn't check in until almost 4 p.m. Some of the desk clerks can be quite brusque. The bell captain, on the other hand, bent over backward to try to help out, storing my luggage for me, etc. Because the hotel was packed to the gills the week I was there, the service was more rudimentary than perhaps it would normally be. I wasn't able to get bellhop or concierge assistance during my stay; they were just too busy. Security was very good.High-speed internet access is available, but costly ($10 per day), and don't try to get help with the hookup. I fixed the initial problem with my hookup myself, but I've been a server administrator for 20 years. I don't know that a regular user would have been able to get connected without help. I waited on the tech support line for about 20 minutes while I was trying to fix the problem myself, and did finally resolve the issue while I was on hold. I never got an actual person on the line before I fixed it. If I'd been a normal user, that would have been pretty frustrating, I think. Hotel staff knows nothing about how to do the hookup; it's a third party company that does the support.Room service is disappointing; very expensive and the food is not particularly good. It also took a long time to get the food. Overall, for the price, a little disappointing, but not bad. By the way, don't judge the hotel by its outside appearance; it looks like a prison block from the outside, but it's nicer than that.

<Content>Excellent Location Having just spent 6 nights in the Radisson Hotel during January, we found no real problems at all. The room was large, clean and warm. (heating was a bit noisy) The balcony and room safe were an added bonus. The location was great with plenty of places to eat near by. Many of the city's attractions were within walking distance and the 'T' station was not that far away.

<Content>Best Buy I stayed at the Radisson Boston in mid January. It is in walking distance of theatres (live and cinema) a comedy club, great restaurants and the subway (called the T). The rooms are very spacious, the beds are comfortable, and the maid service is top notch. Ask for a room away from the elevator because its quite loud. Its best to get a room facing the Hancock building - the view will be awesome. Their restaurant, called the Theatre Cafe, has great food, but it is a little pricey. Breakfast will be about $15.00 for one person.The workout room faces the swimming pool. All are enclosed in glass so you see a great view of the city, but it also means that if you're swimming, the folks in the gym get a view of your rear.The only minuses I can think of is that the business center only has two computer terminals, and its about 10 dollars for 15 minutes to use the Internet. There's also no fridge, microwave or VCR in the rooms.If you're traveling to Boston, there's no need to rent a car. Just take the T everywhere. You can take shuttle #33 at Ground Transportation at Logan to the T subway. The Arlington or Boylston stop are closest to the Radisson.I would stay there again.

<Content>Great Stay We had a great stay here on New years eve, Check in was courteous and efficient, bell boy was delightful, even taking a map of the city with him to our room and showing us what and where everything was happening on first night.We had a bit of a party happening above us at around 4 a.m. when I called the desk they were apologetic and the noise stopped within 5 minutes as she said she would send up security - it happened as they said it would so thumbs up.Didn't check out the facilites there at all but our room was very tastefully decorated with two queen beds in it (even though we only booked a king room !!), with a balcony with a view of the John Hancock building etc,. It's in a great location too, 5 mins walk from Boston Common.We'll be back for sure.

<Content>Overall a good experience Stayed here about 3 times in the past four years. Used to stay at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel and Towers but when the rates when up found the Radisson online and it is right around the corner from the Boston Park Plaza. GREAT LOCATION: Close to the theatre district, Boston Common, Newberry Street, and the Long Wharf area. The rooms are big and are fairly priced for a Boston hotel.Only compaints are that the service is a little slow during busy times and during one of my stays there were three or four tiny ants on the floor.

<Content>100% Satisfaction Guaranteed?? Having spent a night in the Radisson I made the mistake of using the hotel phone-after 11 minutes on an international call I was horrified to be greeted with a bill for $58-on querying this extortionate charge with the duty manager (after several efforts) I finally was told to review the phone call charge was explained in full on the reverse of the 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed% leaflet, I finally found said leaflet and there it was on the reverse of the 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed% how ironic- when I still queried how even with a $5 dollar connection charge and 50% excess charge, a call could total $58 I was told that it was not the duty managers problem and to ask for the rooms director the next morning, I did and was not even granted the dignity of a response from him/her just told that a $17 discount would be given, i mentioned my total disastifaction and went away angry and upset.I find this sly and ignorant behaviour from a world class hotel both sad and aloof and feel that that such behaviour can only result in these type of reviews been written.

<Content>Great location.........Large rooms I just spent 4 nights in Boston with 4 old friends. We booked two rooms at the Radisson. We were given adjoining rooms per our request which enhanced our stay tremendously. We were able to have 2 and 3 in each room have the adjoining door open and have plenty of room to visit, just like our college days. The rooms were very large with several chairs for sitting and visiting. The rooms were exceptionally clean and our request for extra pillows was aknowledged within minutes. The location was ideal as we had plans to visit all areas of the city.My only suggestion would be to double check your meal plans in another place as we were advised poorly for several of our meals. I would not check with the concierge in the future. Overall, I would choose the Radisson again when visiting Boston

<Content>Not highly recommended This appears to be an older hotel (i.e., 30-40 years old) that has received only superficial renovation. Staff were fairly pleasant, but we had to prod them several times to bring our luggage up to the room. Bathroom facilities and pool area would not be out of place in a Motel 6. For the price, breakfast should be included and the rooms should be in much better condition. On the positive side, it is convenient to much of Boston, particularly if you want to be able to walk - just a few minutes' walk from Boston Common. All in all - not highly recommended. My first time at a Radisson, and it didn't leave a positive impression. Would rather recommend the Airport Hilton, even though it is not as close to downtown - cheaper, better rooms, breakfast included.

<Content>Nice hotel....great location Really nice hotel but expensive (between $225  $300) plus parking. Location is everything about this hotel. I have stayed at the Crosstown Hampton Inn which is actually nicer and cheaper but the location isn't convenient. I would stay at the Radisson again if I needed to stay in this location. Many good restaurants and theaters within walking distance - plus Boston Commons!

<Content>Rooms are massive, swimming pool a bit small... The hotel is beautiful, we stayed in a best western in New york and the difference is unbelievable. While the best western room was tiny, in the Radisson, the room was massive with lovely nightime views over Boston, all the rooms have good views i think cos all the hotel rooms are above the 8th or 10th floor, the lower floors are for parking. Lovely big comfortable beds in the rooms and right in the centre of Boston. By the way, I recommend Bennigans across the road for great food and drinks too.

<Content>Great Stay! We just got back from Boston and had a wonderful stay at the Radisson. Our family visiting from England was given a small suite with balcony, which they very much enjoyed. It was by the elevator but they did not have any noise complaints. Ours was on a very high floor and had a beautiful view. It was very nice and roomy. We found the rooms to be very clean and the staff to be very helpful. We would definitely stay there again. And the hotel is situated in a nice area close to good restaurants and shopping.I booked the rooms through a third party (Central Reservation Service) and was very pleased with the price and service. The cancellation policy is that of the hotel- unlike with other discount reservation companies.Excellent experience.

<Content>Nice hotel. I stayed at the Radisson with my girlfriend for four nights in August 2004 and found most of the comments within TripAdvisor to be correct. The room we were initially given although very nice, was next to the lifts which were just too noisy. We were moved almost immedately, so full marks for that! The location was OK but it should be mentioned, there have been problems recently within the Theatre District where specifically, tourists have been targetted leaving theatre's or walking alone back to hotels. I think it's wise just to be aware that this problem exists here as it does in every large city. Back to the review. A couple of negatives. No one seemed to shower before using the pool even after working out in the attached gym, very un-hygenic. The charges to use the Hotel's internet facility are obcene, $9.00 for 15 minutes. And you may be staying in a large branded hotel chain in a major US city, but that does not give you the right to ask for a drink from the bar once closed (it was 00:30), regardless whether the TWO reception staff are busy chatting about boyfriends or not...Can you believe that? I've stayed in many Radissons around the world and never before been refused a drink as a guest, maybe I've just been lucky! Overall, I would still recomend this hotel but I would proberbly stay somewhere else next time.

<Content>Great hotel I got my hotel on Hotwire and was shocked about how nice it was. My room was huge, and it's in a great location, especially for the 4th of July. It was very clean and the view was awesome. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good location, value, helpful I visit Boston regularly and have been staying at the Tremont Hotel. This time the rate at the Radisson was similar so I decided to give the Radisson a try. Also an older property, but in pretty good shape...better than the Tremont. When I checked in they offered an upgrade to a small suite but warned me it was near an elevator...decided on a business room instead. Happy with the room and location...Good restaurants are nearby...Legal Seafood across the street, PF Changs a block away.

<Content>Great Location This hotel may look drab from the outside but the rooms with balconies are spacious and comfortable. Staff are good and kids enjoyed the pool. Hotel is metres away from the common and shopping areas. Get rid of your hire car here you won't need it. Will go again

<Content>Very good location, nice views, and good price The Radisson in Boston is in an ideal location. It is only a short walk from either the Arlington or Boylston Street T Stations on the green line, as well as Boston Commons, Back Bay, Legal Sea Foods (across the street) and as a bonus, if you take the trolley tour (you should) which introduces you to Boston and the Freedom Trail, it specifically stops right in front of the Radisson as a routine stop. I think it was 27 bucks a day, 10 for any subsequent day. You get off and on as many times as you please between 9 and 5 and it hits every place you've heard of in Boston except Fenway. You'll need the subway for that. Ask the Concierge where to buy it. I won't argue with some of the other users who complain about a somewhat abrasive staff at the Radisson, that is why I only gave it four stars, but they weren't that bad. They would be considered downright friendly if they were in New York. Another bonus is balconies for every room. Ask for the West facing side of the hotel for great views of the John Hancock tower, Prudential tower, and South Boston (as well as nice sunsets on cloudy days). The on-premises restaurant is quite good, offering a breakfast buffet (or menu items) and good food other times too. Room did smell like smoke even though it was non-smoking, couldn't say why that is, but you might be prepared for the possibility if it bothers you. Hotel offers parking, and rapes you for it at 28 bucks a day, but hey, that's the Big City. I think it's fairly typical, really. Don't keep a car in Boston if you can avoid it, you won't need it. If you drive in as I did, go with Hertz or Budget, as they are across the street from the Hotel, but a challenge to find. Drive in front of the hotel and make the first possible left-hander just as you see Legal Sea Foods on your left. Car rental is on your left about 100 feet after the turn. I mention this because it took me an hour to find it the first time, as if they tried to hide it. Yes, I know there is no place to park either when dropping off a car, double-park it. Even Budget will tell you to do so, and a cop watched me, unphased. Try this hotel, it's not luxury, but it is upscale, with nice rooms, and a very convenient location. Overall, very good for the price. Just across the way, the Park Plaza might be a good bet for higher end accommodations, all of the last six presidents have stayed there, supposedly. In Boston, don't underestimate the location, this one is very good. I do recommend this place for affordable Boston accommodations that are very nice and in a convenient location.

<Content>Great Stay Our family (with 3 kids ages 8, 6  4) recently stayed here and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The room was spacious with updated decor and comfortable queen beds. The concierge was helpful in recommending a restaurant (Legal Seafoods, right around the corner was excellent!). The kids loved the pool and enjoyed the breakfast buffet (included with our package). I found the location great and close to everything. Would stay again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Beware of booking this hotel thru Hotel Pronto In July we made a 4 night booking at Radisson Hotel thru Hotel Pronto. However when we arrived (at midnight due to flight delay) there was no record of booking - even though we had email with voucher reference, and proof that we had paid for a room. It was extremely difficult to find an alternative hotel room at that time of night in Boston, but evenutally one was found at the Colonnade hotel, which was more expensive. The Radisson hotel are refusing to acknowledge that they received a booking - Hotel Pronto are insisting a booking was made, and we have been left to pick up the bill of the more expensive hotel. So beware!

<Content>Good deal, nothing fancy Got a good rate on this centrally located hotel. Room was clean and smoke free. Had to call twice to get a crib delivered. When it came, my son cried. I couldn't blame him, it looked like it had last been used in a 19th century orphanage. Requested warm milk from room service and got cold. But the location is great, just a few blocks to the common. Lots of eating choices nearby as well. I wouldn't spend several nights here but it was fine for a mid-trip overnight.

<Author>Restal
<Content>Comfortable and roomy Just returned from staying in the Radisson Boston on a businesss trip. Got an excellent rate on Expedia and got good value. The bedrooms were huge - practically the same size as the whole of my Edinburgh Apartment! The beds were really comfy and despite some noise on the Saturday when the Sox were playing the hotel was quiet. The swimming pool is on the 9th floor with a sun terrace and looks to be very popular with families. There is also a terrace for the restaurant so we could eat breakfast outside in the sun. Small gripes are the slightly tired decor and the noisy a/c but as not used to air conditioning in the UK this may have been OK. The area is not the most picturesque although it is safe and central with some good restaurants on the doorstep ie Legal seafoods and a short walk to Boston Common. I think that this hotel is on a par with any of the UK Thistle chain that I have stayed in and I would definitely return.

<Content>Five Fantastic Family Days at the Radisson Our family of four, with 12 and 16 year old children, could not have picked a better place! Our room on the 16th floor had a super balcony facing the Prudential and John Hancock buildings--great for sunrises and sunsets, and a place for our son to practice his guitar. We had the family deal, which included all you could eat breakfast (until noon!) at the hotel restaurant, and daily parking. The two queen size beds, in a large room, were oh-so-comfortable. The room, including the bathroom, was very clean. Superb location to subway, Public Garden, Boston Common, Theater District, Newbury Street, Back Bay, Chinatown and many great restaurants. After a fun day of sightseeing, the indoor pool was great, the exercise room very nice, and the sundeck superb. Enjoyed this hotel over the Park Plaza, which is across the street. The two concierge were great, but the gentleman at the front desk was rude. Ignore him, and have a fabulous time!

<Content>Good location I thought this hotel was OK. A bit tired but very reasonably priced. There was some renovation going on in the Theater cafe but we went a few blocks away for breakfast. The gym is pretty small, with 2 treadmills only so you have to get in early, as there are a lot of business people using the hotel. It is only a 5 minute walk to the common and the same to chinatown. Would probably stay there again.

<Content>Redisson needs to be renovated The hotel definetely needs a makeover. The rooms are really old and furniture too (it still feels like 80ies). Bathrooms should be updated completelly.If you are looking for cheap and basic accomodations - this may work for you, but otherwise you will be disappointed as we were.No question that location is great.We found that Seaport Hotel is only $30 more expensive but in great new condition.

<Content>Best hotel for the price We stayed at the Radisson Boston on June 25th for one night. The room was immaculate, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Anything you wanted, they would get for you. Don't believe the reviews about dirty rooms and bad staff. I would stay here again in a heart beat. We came into town to see Blue Man. A must see, especially if you have kids. Plus the hotel in only steps away from the playhouse. After we had dessert at Finale. Excellent staff and food. Try the Chocolate Bliss, it was a bit much, but you might as well go all out if you are only going to eat there once.

<Content>Incredibly Rude...would never stay there again While the rooms were very clean and well maintained, the staff at this hotel makes it unbearable. The hotel is in a great location, but for people that are in the business of hospitality I was incredibly disappointed. I traveled with a group of 8 and from the hostile check-in to the rude wait staff at breakfast we were all unimpressed. You are better off staying somewhere else.

<Content>Great web deal on a nice room I always read these reviews when researching a hotel room. They are usually accurate. If you read the Radisson's reviews they were pretty much on the money. Ater much research, I booked my room on the Radisson.com site. The rate(web deal only) was only $119.( I called to verify the room wasn't in the garage or boiler room.) The location was perfect. The room was very clean, spacious, 2 comfortable queen beds,and, no stains on the rug. Bathroom needed updating but again very clean and plenty of hot water. Air conditioning cold. I needed to change rooms because ours was next to a very fast and loud elevator. View wasn't the best, ask to be on upper floor. Watch virtual tour. Oh yes parking is separate $28 day. I don't know if I would have paid the regular rate of $179-199 but for $119 plus 28 for parking it was well worth it. You can walk every where from this hotel. Email me for any questions.

<Content>My place to stay in Boston A great location, a great hotel. It's not the most beautiful building from the outside, but the rooms are spacious. The bed was comfortable. The staff was very helpful. The breakfast buffet was fine -- not a great deal, but if you want cheap eats there are plenty of places walking distance. So far, the best place I've stayed in Boston ... so good, in fact, that I'm not shopping around anymore.

<Content>Good hotel My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights and it was good. We were on the 18th floor- I didn't notice any noise though- I'm a pretty heavy sleeper though. The room was nice- we were upgraded to a jr. suite. The bathroom was dated but clean- no tub.The service was good except for the concierge- both concierge were fantastic! Location was good. We booked at the radisson website and got free parking so that was good. We went to see the Blue Man Group and the theater was only a couple blocks away!I have to say though that breakfast in the restaurant was terrible. We only ate in the restaurant once because it just wasn't good. I would stay here again though there were a lot of restaurants close by and the location was really great! Overall we were very pleased.

<Content>OK, but bring ear plugs i stayed at the radisson for a weekend trip to boston. the location is great, close to mass transit, roadways, and attractions. parking is pretty expensive, $26 per day. the rooms were clean and spacious. Unfortunately, our room was on the 19th floor and overlooked a municipal parking lot next to a theater and night club. both nights, at 230am the crowds would depart from the buildings and loiter in the lot. the police would then come and use their sirens and airhorns to move the crowd. this usually lasted until 330am. i value my sleep and that disruption to it annoyed me. if i hadn't received a great deal from one of the internet sites, i would have been very upset. perhaps it was quieter on the other side of the building, i don't know. i suspect the 230am siren song is a routine occurrence.

<Content>Views!Views!Views! Just returned from a memorable visit to the Radisson Boston. We were travelling with 2 boys, ages 10 and 11, and they were thrilled with the whole place. The pool was great, the ice cream machine, and they went crazy over the views. We were on the 20th floor facing the John Hancock Building and to walk out on our balcony while the sun rose with a hot cup of coffee brewed in our own coffee maker was pretty amazing. The whole room was great--beds were extremely comfortable, bathroom very roomy, nice toiletries and seemed pretty new and fresh. We did order room service and it was very good. The kids meals were plentiful and the appetizer for adults was delicious and very reasonably priced considering it was room service. The hotel was a very short distance, about half football field, from a Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and lots of great restaurants. We rode the T on our whole trip as we had gone to the city on the Downeaster Amtrak and the Boylston and Arlington stops were very nearby. All in all a wonderful trip and the Radisson Hotel definitely played a big part in that.

<Content>Highly Recommended!!! If you are looking on your computer for a great place to stay in Boston, then the Radisson is the place! I spent 4 nights at the hotel, and I loved every minute of it. The first thing the hotel has in its favor is it's location. Youre within walking distance from Boston Common, Public Garden, Chinatown, and the Theater District. I had an absolute beautiful view of the downtown skyline from my balcony (which all rooms have). Try to catch the sunrise if you're an early bird. The hotel is on one of the stops from the Trolley Tour, if you decide to do some sightseeing in the city. The rooms at the Radisson are absolutely wonderful. Clean, updated, and make you feel like youre at home. The TV was huge (although not much of a channel selection), enormous closet with extra hangers, and the beds....ahhhh, soooo comfortable. The comforters were silky feeling, and they must have had some sort of pillow mattress on the beds. The staff at the Radisson were extremely pleasant and show personal attention to everyone they come in contact with. The conceirge (which, shamefully, I cannot remember his name) went out of his way to make sure we had stuff to do and made us feel comfortable. Another staff member, Eric, was extremely helpful in helping us find the route to take on the T to see Harvard and MIT. The food at the restaurant was excellent. (Try the clam chowder and the steak sandwich!) I know I've said so much already, but I seriously can't say enough to let you know how lucky Boston is to have the Radisson helping to represent the city. I highly recommend anyone to stay here. If you have any questions about the hotel, feel free to email me.

<Content>What a great value hotel! Just returned from a fabulous break in Boston. This was our second stay at this Radisson in three years and it just gets better. We managed to get a great deal on the hotel's own website but it is worth looking around. The hotel is in a very good location as we found it central to everything. Walking is great in Boston with nothing taking more than half an hour to reach. I must mention the one thing that makes Boston one of our favourite places, the ordinary Bostonians!! On our first trip we were lost twice and looking at our tourist map and twice Bostonians approached us with assistance. On our most recent visit we were bemused at exactly where we were on the map and again we were approached with kind offers of assistance!! Our party had two young children, aged two and four, and the hotel couldn't have been more helpful and friendly towards them, we didn't feel out of place at all. Breakfast is available at the hotel although a bit pricey it does include as much as you can eat. Young children eat free which was a bonus. The hotel rooms have recently been refurbished and are of a high quality. Everything was clean and tidy. (A tip for people with young children, a visit to the Children's Science Museum is a must and also there is a large playground on the Common) I would recommend this hotel to any visitor that is looking for a good location and excellent value. We can't wait for our next trip to Boston.

<Content>Best Staff in the City Mike Jerrier and John Hallet were awesome! They each helped me locate things to see and do in the City. I felt very comfortable at the Radisson. They are both funny and easy to approach to ask questions. Please let them know, they made a lasting impression. I will definately visit the Radisson again. The location of the Radisson is great also, it was easy for me to walk to many tourist attractions. I felt safe walking in the area around the hotel.

<Content>Good Value Just returned from a weekend stay at the Radisson. Got a good rate on their website averaging $99 per night for Saturday/Sunday nights. Location: Good. Two blocks north to the Commons and Gardens, Boylston Green Line T. Reasonable walk to Copley or Downtown/Faneuil. Heart of Theater District. Legal Seafood, McCormick and Schmick's, Bennigans, Finale, California Pizza Kitchen, Maggiano's all within one block. Room: Very nice. Good-sized. Newish, quality furnishings. Large closet. Excellent bedding touches. New carpeting. Most everything in the main room area seemed new. Iron and board. Coffee pot and service. A real balcony with a very good view. Little street noise from the 15th floor, but this is a city hotel and it can never be completely avoided. Better than most. Thankfully, no adjoining door. Our trip was as quiet as hotel stays go. Bathroom: Not as renovated as the room. New caulking, though. Clean. Numerous good towels. Respectable and acceptable, but not the same level as the room itself. Public Areas: All well kept. Halls always clean and clear. Small but pleasant bar area. Service: Good housekeeping. Pleasant, courteous staff. Glitches: Early wake-up calls each morning - that were not requested. The second day we complained. You're not part of the group? was the polite response. Mistake on the bill was quiuckly corrected. Overall, a quality establishment, comfortable. I would stay again.

<Content>Great Location With tickets to a show at the Colonial Theatre, we searched for a convenient hotel. The Raddison is right in the Theatre District, so we were able to walk to the show. There are several excellent eating establishments nearby. We were also within walking distance to Filene's and shopping district. The hotel was clean and comfortable. We will stay again if we go into Boston.

<Content>highly disappointed We stayed at the Radisson Hotel on January 30th 2004 (super bowl weekend). The car honking for the New England Patriots went on from 11:00 until 4:00 am. Our room overlooked the street side and was so noisy we slept only 2 hours. Also, we had a 3:00 am evacuation due to a false fire alarm. That sent several hundred guests into the street in our pajamas into below freezing temperatures. We finally got to sleep at 4:00 am but due to a business appointment had to get up at 6:00am! The next morning we had a very disappointing breakfast in a cold conference room due to restaurant renovations - What more can I say? I would not stay at this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel! Stayed at the Radisson over xmas and had a really good time. The Restaurent was being renovated so was not open and breakfast was being served on another floor. Great rooms very big and very, very clean. Cant fault the hotel in any way at all. Its the 3rd time i have stayed in this hotel and would not hesitate to stay there again. If your thinking of staying there, do it! You wont be disappointed.

<Content>Good service, good rooms. Having read the other reviews, It was 50/50 on whether I had made the right choice. I glad to say that I did! The staff were very friendly and helpful with any enquiry. The room was very spacious and had everything, and only tiny marks on the carpet. The bath drainage blocked on the first night but the maintenance man arrived within 5 minutes, problem solved. Breakfast expensive, better to go out, plenty of places to try. Be careful with advice from concierge, we asked for a good Irish bar that served food, with live music, got the food but also got IRA supporters providing the music. We do not have any Political preference, but it could have been nasty. After paying for the trolley tour, we found that we had already walked around all the sights of Boston. Small place! Quite boring actually, make sure you do not stay more than 3 nights. Oh, and the bar was dismantled while we were out during the day for renovation, quite a suprise when we went for a drink.

<Content>Great value - Good location to start your tour of Boston Only complaint is the beds were not the most comfortable. (although they quickly responded when we asked for some additional pillows) Otherwise, consierge was very helpful (got us a last minute reservation on the Duck Tour!) Rooms were a decent size. Restaraunt downstairs was a great place for breakfast. Location was great for beginning a tour of Boston. Parking was easy. You are a block from Boston Commons and the Freedom Trail.

<Content>Not what I expected I would have to give this hotel an adequate rating. When I booked it online, it said it was 4 stars...and Ive been to nicer 3 star hotels. Our room looked worn, with massive carpet stains and the bathroom tiles discolored and cracked. The view was ok, we could see the part of the Pru. Our room was next to the elevators, which are very noisy, and there was an ungodly sound in our room every time someone in an adjacent room used the shower (at 4am!). The staff, however, was most helpful, especially the concierge. The value was ok, considering our great location. But breakfast in the Theater Cafe was 3 times as much as we thought it would be. I think I would try another hotel next time.

<Content>Nice place, big rooms! I stayed here for four nights in September 2003. I booked on expedia and got an excellent deal, saving several hundred pounds on what I would have been charged had I paid Radisson's normal rate for the room. If you're looking at a map while reading this, the hotel is on Stuart Street, diagonally opposite the Massachusetts Transportation Building. Got to the hotel by taxi - $26 - but found out that it is only about two minutes from Arlington T stop which is only $1! So that's an option, especially if you have been to Boston before and don't have a lot of luggage. Our room was on the 11th floor, which sounds high, but the first 8 are taken up by a multi-storey car park! The hotel has 24 floors. Room was huge, two very comfortable queen-sized beds, and enormous television, clock radio and good chairs and tables. You also get a free copy of USA Today (useless for European news...) delievered outside your door every morning, Spotless bathroom with one of those odd hotel baths that isn't actually big enough to have a bath in at all. Hot, powerful shower though. All rooms have a balcony which give views either towards the Financial District and the harbour (and airport!) or to Back Bay and the John Hancock Tower. The hotel pool is small - max depth 5ft and you couldn't practice for the Olympics in it - but it is fine for a bit of relaxation after a long day. The gym had quite a lot of stuff in it too. There is also a sun terrace on the pool level, with loungers, chairs, tables and a lovely view towards Back Bay and southern Boston.There are plenty of restaurants on the street outside which were decent and well-priced so you don't have to wander around looking for something to eat when you arrive (beware 7 11 at night though - there are guys purporting to be homeless who stand outside the door and open it for you, shaking their cup of coins as they do. To avoid them, go there during the day). It's also about 10 minutes walk in one direction to the shopping centres at the Prudential Tower and Copley Plaza, and in the other direction there are plenty of theatres to keep you amused. Mariah Carey was singing there when we arrived - alas we couldn't hear her from outside...Other reviewers mention the T - to be frank, there's little need to take it! It's one block to Boston common and from there you can wander to downtown, so if you're good on your feet you won't need to use the T at all. We used it once - when we returned from the shopping centre in Cambridge laden with bags!We also had breakfast at the hotel. At $14 for a hot buffet (the best value option), that's quite cheap for a hotel breakfast. Plenty of choice, excellent staff, decent food although the toaster took some working out!In all, if you can get a good deal from expedia or some other website for this hotel, it is well worth booking.PS - other reviewers mention the dirt stains on the carpet. We had them too! Don't let this make you think the carpets hadn't seen a hoover though; they were vacuumed every day. The carpets are light green, which unfortunately means someone spilling coffee, tea or any other coloured drink will mark the carpet. The carpets are clean, just dyed a little!

<Content>Nice. Nice clean rooms. The ambience can not compare to that of the Boston Park Plaza. Pool always crowded with lots of kids. Concierge very helpful. Work out room small but there. Beautiful view from 19th floor of Boston skyline. Good deal for $.

<Content>Great Stay!!! What a surprise this hotel was. I was there once before and thought it was nice place. Went back for a 4 day birthday weekend present in January. We were given a wonderful room with two balconies and beautiful views of the city. The rooms were excellent, clean and quiet with plenty of room to stretch out in and relax in. My hats off to the help, they were very helpful and pointing out things to do and see. I believe I got a wonderful rate too that included parking, which was great, given that we drove to Boston, and didn't want to worry about parking the car. The Radisson in Boston is a great place and when I go back to Boston, thats the place I will be staying at!!

<Content>A Very Nice Hotel If you're looking for a really good place to stay that won't break the bank...well here it is. To me there are 4 basics to a decent hotel...1) a comfortable bed. 2) A decent TV 3) a shower that works, 4) good staff. Well this hotel has all four of the basics.The room was very clean and we had a great view of Western Boston. The bed was a King size and it was a welcome reliefe especially after walking all day in Boston.The concierge was extrodinarily friendly and helpful and aided to my few requests.All in all I would stay here again without any hesitation.That's it from me ... simple and straight forward.

<Content>Great location, average room We have 2 kids (3yr and 5 months old) and found the downtown location quite good. The Old Trolley stops at the hotel (very good way of getting around and seeing the city if you haven't been before.) Starbucks is across the street, as is Legal Sea Food! Amazingly, we also had stains on the carpet. (is this in every room?!) Overall, not bad service, although they wouldn't give us a kettle to make formula for the baby.
