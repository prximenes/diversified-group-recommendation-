<Content>Great for those who want to party, but not stay at the party My wife and I stayed here New Years Eve for our Fifth Anniversary. We found the location perfect, the staff highly professional, and the accommodations outstanding!My wife had a broken leg, so we requested a room near the elevator. The staff was very accommodating, and even allowed early check - in (it was around noon).The location is on Canal Street, within walking distance of all of the highlights of the French Quarter. We were able visit all of the key parts (Cafe du Monde, French Market, Bourbon Street) with ease. We had a good time watching the Fleur-de-Lis drop on Jackson Square.The valet staff, especially Alvin, was outstanding. They were very helpful and understanding of my wife's broken leg. The concierge was helpful in trying to secure last minute dinner reservations, even on New Years Eve.We got a mid level room, with a full view of the French Quarter. The room was spacious, even though it was an accessible room. As it was Sugar Bowl time, there were many from the University of Alabama staying on the site. We did hear much of their partying, as we were next to the elevator, but we were able to drown out the noise. It was New Years Eve; what do you expect?We loved our first visit to New Orleans, and we fully expect to use this property when we return.

<Content>Only great location This hotel has one of the best locations for all you want to do while in New Orleans, but the rooms are run down they are under staffed and the upgrade to the conceriege level was not worth the breakfast they put out or the late afternoon snacks and they charged for drinks.If you do stay here make sure you get a room with a river view. I would not stay here again, even with the great location. The lobby was also too convention feeling. The security was poor and the elevators slow. We were on the 48th floor and it was a constant wait.Its a shame because if this was run better and with some care and fix ups it would be just fine.

<Content>Worst Hotel Ive Ever Stayed At! When I arrived for check-in at 4:00 pm, I was told my room which I had booked three weeks in advance was not ready. After traveling for 6 hours instead of showering and changing in my $219.00 a night room, I settled for no shower and had to use the handi-cap stall of their very dirty second floor bathroom (I had somewhere to be at 6:00 pm)! I then had to park my car 8 blocks down at a parking garage, because there was no room in the hotel's valet parking garage! I was finally able to check-in at 3:00 AM the following morning! I then handed my luggage claim ticket to the bell hop and went to use the restroom, however, when I returned the bell hop, the only bell hop on duty, did not remember me or me handing him my ticket! After arguing that I had giving it to him 3 minutes before he eventually found it in his pocket! I attempted to speak to a manager about this horrible hotel experience, I waited at the desk for he or she for 30 minutes, NO ONE EVER CAME! Now I have an extra charge of $156.00 from the hotel, but when I settled my bill it was only $42.00. I just tried to call to settle this but I was transfered to an answer machine! DO NOT STAY HERE!

<Content>Terrible Service, Terrible Stay The service offered at this hotel is absolutely unacceptable. I arrived at the hotel to check in at 3 pm. The garage was full, and no help was offered by the front desk on where else we could park our car. We ended up parking at Harrah鈥檚 which is a long walk back to the Sheraton (and $30 per day to park). Once we got back to the Sheraton, we waited in a line for 45 minutes to check in with all of our luggage and were told that we would have to 鈥淲ait an hour or two until we could have a room because there were at least 70 people in front of us and the rooms were not clean鈥? This is at 4 pm. (I was later told by another disappointed customer of the hotel that he had checked in the day before and had the exact same experience- this is not a one time mistake, and management obviously did nothing to correct it) We waited for an hour and a half and had no choice but to head straight to our event from the hotel lobby with no shower or nap - the reasons we had booked the hotel. We couldn鈥檛 check in until 12 pm that night, and were never called like we were told we would be. When we asked the next day how we would be compensated for what we went through the night before we were told that there was nothing they could do except to 鈥渆nroll us in a point program that COULD earn us points up to a free stay!鈥? We declined that and instead called Orbitz customer service鈥?who in the end offered us a $25 rebate. We stayed in this hotel for approximately 6 hours and were charged the full price of what it would have been if we had a pleasant stay; our entire stay in New Orleans was ruined by the Sheraton on Canal Street, PLEASE PICK ANOTHER HOTEL TO STAY IN!

<Content>Nice Stay for 1st Anniversary My wife and I stayed three nights over New Years at the Sheraton for our first wedding anniversary. It was our first trip to New Orleans, and we had an amazing time.The hotel iteself is above average, and truly a decent price for the location. I wouldn't recommend being right in the French Quarter due to the noise. The Sheraton was right near Canal St. and close to the casino, French Quarter, and trolley cars. The parking rate was high, but everything in the city is expensive. There are a lot of good restaurants nearby!We had an easy time checking in and out. We were there during the Sugar Bowl, so the hotel was packed! The only problems we experienced were long waits for the elevator. We were on the 41st floor, and one day waited 30 minutes and never got an elevator. Eventually we just took the service elevator down. Luckily we were just enjoying a day with no plans, so it wasn't a biggie to us. Others on the floor had to check out and catch flights, which was inconvient.Overall, I would stay here again without a doubt. The room had a nice king sized bed, and we paid a few extra bucks more and got the high floor with a river view. That was a great decision, because on New Years at midnight, we had a perfect view of the fireworks on the river right from our room. Not to mention we could see fireworks from all over the entire area from our window. The concierge was helpful with dinner suggestions, and the valet staff was quick and prompt.

<Content>Not plesant We stayed at the hotel mainly for a conference. I have stayed in many Sheraton in different cities and this is my first time in New Orleans. The front desk personnel did not seem like that they are happy to work or serve their customers. Both times check-in  out, no smile, not much expression and hi or bye, but hand you the paperwork. The concerige service is sub-optimal. We were requesting for help to call for a taxi to get back to the hotel. They answered the phone and told us that they will call a cab, we waited for 15-20mins with no taxi. Then, calling the concerige service back and they told us that we should have gotten the taxi company phone # from them instead. We were so frustrated that we just went to a local store and they helped us call a taxi. Just overall very disappointed with the hotel. The location is great but the service is disappointing.

<Content>Great gumbo, great location, annoying surprise fees Great location. Food was excellent. Best gumbo I had while in town--even better than the Gumbo House.Responsive service. Positives offset by annoying (sometimes non-disclosed fees) as noted by other reviewers. Theses fees includeL-$5 for a package (not disclosed), -early check out fee of 1 nights room and tax (not disclosed), and- an outrageous $10 to use the health club (basic hotel work out room). Also, my room needed vacuming (candy wrapper on floor). On the plus side, convenient to the French Quarter and tourist attractions. Overall, recommended.

<Content>Couldn't Sleep Don't make this mistake-unless you don't want to sleep, do not get a room with a view of Canal St. I was on the 17th floor and I could hear people screaming at all house down on the street..Loud music did not stop until 3am. The valet parking at $26.95 is a rip. I did not eat breakfast since they wanted $21 for something I can get at IHOP for $6. Luckily I got this cheap on Priceline, if I had paid more, I would not be happy. Service was okay-the housekeeping misunderstood the do not disturb sign and thought they didn't have to come back and clean, but the front desk took care of it. When I checked out I told the lady at the desk how loud it was and she said oh we should have given you a river view. I didn't know, so hopefully this helps someone else out.

<Content>Great Location My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sheraton for the Sugar Bowl over New Years. The hotel was obviously very crowded because of the game (Go Dawgs) but the staff was very professional in handling the mass chaos. Everything was very organized and clean. The room was beautiful - huge ceiling to floor windows. Very clean. The bed was incredible!Room service food kind of sucked - soup was very cold. But again, staff was super friendly. Check out was great, valet was organized and professional. Only thing was, I left my jewelry on the counter of the bathroom and when I called later that day to ask if it had been turned in, I was told no. The manager said they would contact me, and never did, even after I called several more times. I know they're not responsible for any items left in the rooms after check out but you do expect a different level of responsibility when you stay somewhere like the Sheraton.Otherwise, it's a beautiful hotel with a great location.

<Content>Wonderful hotel Just spent the weekend at the Sheraton - downtown New Orleans. We could not have been happier with our stay. We were provided a room immediately upon arrival even though we arrived about 11am. We knew we were booked in a Club Level room which was nice - beautiful city view. A continental breakfast and evening appetizers were available each day in the Club lounge for Club Level guests. Hotel location is excellent - central to everything. French quarter is just across Canal St. Staff and accomodations were great and hotel itself is very nice. They even accomodated our request for a slightly later check-out. Our stay at the Sheraton was booked as a package but overall a great value. I would stay at the Sheraton-New Orleans again and recommend it highly.

<Content>Club room not a big deal If you are going to the hotel for a meeting and have a special price for the rooms via the hotel, I would suggest you check Expedia, Travelociy, etc. If they are about the same, then book through the hotel and ask them when you need to cancel by without penalty. Then the day before you can cancel without penalty check Expedia, Travelocity again as they will begin to dump rooms at a much lower cost ($40-$70 per night in some cases). You can save much more if this is not a busy weekend in NO. Also if you are by yourself, skip the Club floors. The cost is not worth what you get. The breakfast is just a typical continental breakfast and the evening horderves are nothing special. Extra cost for alcohol anyway. The rooms are not any different than the other floors. If you are traveling with family then it might be a little better deal unless you plan to eat breakfast out. Location is the best part as you can walk most places. Do not take a car unless you are going to be driving alot as the hotel charges around $30 for overnight parking. No problems with the service of the hotel or the hotel itself, just be smart with your $.

<Content>Nice Sheraton, too much additional; charges |Me and my wife spent few days in the Sheraton - half business half sightsee trip.Very clean and well kept hotel, nice position, big rooms.One of the receptionist was really dumb, but others members of the looked and acted professionaly and got quick answers.As an example - we asked room with one doble bed, and got answers that there is no chance at all, because hotel is booked full. I felt something wrong about that particular receptionist, so asked another staff memeber and imidiatelly got king-size double bed room with good overview on the river.On the POSITIVE side :Big lobby, big rooms, a lot of elevators, nice fitness center and small but clean swimming pool. No steam-bath, but it's Ok.Good attitude of the staff, and excellent advices of the concierje - where to eat, what to look and such.Short walk ( 2-3 minutes ) to Bourbone street or river-side street.On the NEGATIVE side :The ( the hotel ) charge you for everything30$ for over-night parking ( 24 hours ).something like 18$ for parking at the day time onlyyBe carefull - I could no fined free parking in French or Bussiness quaters in New-Orleans.Especially that all nice thing in the city you could see in few day hours and one evening - and we drove a little around - swamps and such.Fitness center - 10$/day useWireless Internet - also.I head from few guest that sheets had strange smell, but neither me not my wife felt it.One more thing - the classic old-time blues we heard from old man sitting alone and playing saxofon on river side. All others bars, restarauns, blues-bars and such offers different kind of music, but not the OLD-STYLE BLUES.

<Content>Great Stay The Sheraton New Orleans is in a great location. It is centrally located to whatever you would want to do as a tourist. I was there over the July 4th weekend during the Essence Festival. I was not attending the Festival, but you could not get away from it. The city, and hotel was packed and lively. The hotel was obviously very busy, but the service never failed. There was a long line to check in, but it moved very quickly. Maybe 5 minutes with 10+ people in front of me. The check-in agent was very pleasant and we had a nice conversation. I was given a room on the 43rd floor, right off the elevator, which I was wary about. My fears were misplaced, however, as I rarely heard any noise. I had a great view of the river and therefore of the fireworks display. I was so high up I could even see the fireworks from surrounding towns! The room was nice and modern, all that I would expect from a large Sheraton in a major city. Bliss products in the bathroom were a real nice touch. I am a smoker and the hotel is all non-smoking, so I had to sit on the front stairs to indulge in my bad habit. I did not use the pool, but could see it from my room, and it did look small for a hotel of this size, as other reviews pointed out.The lobby is huge with a large sitting area for the lounge, that was constantly packed with festival goers.Parking was $30, but coming from New York, where it can cost that for a hour, I didn't feel it was unreasonable. I guess it's just perspective.All in all a great choice for a stay in New Orleans.

<Content>Great View  Great views. Floor to celing windows. Ask for a high floor as the views are obviously better. Everything else is pretty standard. Each time I have stayed there, it has been clean.Only drawback is the parking. $30 a day and slow valet service.Staff is pretty friendly.
