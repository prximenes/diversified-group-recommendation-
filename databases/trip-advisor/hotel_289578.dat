<Content>Nice, basic hostal I stayed at the Hostal Barrera with my husband and parents for 3 nights. The location is great, close to the Anton Martin metro station and the Atocha Renfe train station, as well as close to the two big museums the Prado and the Reina Sofia. I agree with some of the recent comments about the smell in the building- may be due to the old pipes or something, but it is something that we could tolerate. The front desk staff were very nice, very helpful- they own the hostal, and so are more invested than the average hotel worker. The bathrooms are VERY small- we are all fit folks, but anyone who is heavy or physically large will have some major problems using the bathroom/shower here. We banged our arms on the shower glass often when showering. We liked the security and the feeling that we had someone expecting us when we came in. The hotel is noisy- thin walls, echoing floors- so hope that your neighbors don't wear high heels (ours did), use hairdryers at night (ours did), or are heard of hearing (my dad is, and I'm sure everyone in the hostal heard what he had to say). And the trash folks don't worry about whether they are waking anyone up at 5:30 when they come down the street, so bring earplugs.The lift doesn't start at the bottom floor, so it was difficult for my older parents to carry their luggage up the half-flight (and thus hard for me and my husband to carry all our bags up the stairs). Oh, one last thing- they don't want you washing clothes in the room due to water restrictions in Madrid- but they do have laundry facilities on site (for a fee, of course).So- if you're not overweight/too tall, have light luggage and earplugs, you'll be fine. A good deal for the price.

<Content>I don't agree on this. I stayed at Hostal Barrera in Nov. 2008. I booked this hostal after reading the reviews on this site. But, in fact, my opinion on this hostal is a little bit different from the compliments. I think this hostal is good only to the single budget travellers. Don't get me wrong. This is not a bad hostel. But, it is not right to be ranked to be this high as ranked 6. This is not right. I don't recommend this hostel for family. It has superb location, I agree on this, it is no doubt. It is cheap for singles. I stayed in a tripple room since I had a child. But, the extra bed was nearly falling down. The bed had terrible smell and the hostel poured perfume to hide it, I noticed this is very common in cheap hostels in spain. The other problem is their central heating system. If it is too cold, well, there is nothing you can do. Just wear more clothes. The only feature that we really loved was the free Wi-Fi. But, next time I would stay better place. Overall, this is not a bad hostel but you get what you paid for. Recommend only for the budget single travellers. Never to the family with children and old parents.

<Content>Nice stay! We had a long weekend in Madrid, for a concert, football game and attractions. Hostal Barrera was very nice. Very friendly staff, clean rooms, not so big, but nice. No breakfast room, but many small cafees right outside. No minibar. Nice location, walking distance to most things, and i can really recommend this place for a stay in Madrid..Inge Nordgaard, Norway

<Content>Very good overall experience, minus noise issue We have just returned from a week at hostal Barrera. The place is exactly what we expected after looking at the hostal website and TA reviews. The location is great, close to Atocha station, Reina Sofia and Prado museums the great area of Barrio de las Lettras and plaza Santa Ana. Our two rooms were newly refurbished: nicely decorated and very clean; I appreciate particularly the nice personal touch regarding bed sheets and pillowcases. The staff is very nice, Nieves is very welcoming and friendly (we did not need much help though as we visited our son who currently studies in Madrid). The hostal does not offer breakfast but there are a lot of caf茅s in the neighborhood and we enjoyed great breakfasts, every day at a different place, from trendy caf茅 to small local taverna. The only weak point to be mentionned is a noise issue. Curious that most recent reviews point this out whereas previous reviews did not (therefore we were not prepared to this inconvenience). We have not been disturbed by the street noise (the double glazing is efficient for most noises except horns), but by the inside noises from other rooms and from the corridor: early birds being really noisy one day, people coming back in the middle of the night... The walls seems to be paperthin as you can hear the water noises, not only the shower one but also the drops falling when the shower is done. I think the noises are amplified because the tiled floor is resounding. It was not too disturbing for us though, except one night, as we are not light sleepers.Overall a very good experience, Hostal Barrera is definitively great value for the money and we would stay there again, but light sleepers should be aware of the noise issue.

<Content>Very central, good value stay in Madrid. I found Hostal Barrera on this site  decided to try it after reading all the reviews. The approach to the hostal is slightly odd: it's a flat in an appartment building, which has been converted to a hotel. There is 24hours coverage at reception and even though 2 of the 3 staff didn't speak english, they were helpful and very pleasant. The hostal is in a great location, 5-10 minutes walk from the 3 big museums and the Atocha station where the trains to Toledo travel from  2 minutes walk from the nearest underground station. Breakfast is not included but the local cafes were fine. Our room seemed recently decorated and was well appointed and reasonably spacious, and the en suite bathroom was new with a lovely shower. It's good value for money too. The only negative point is that being on the 2nd floor and on a busy road, the room was almost always rather noisy. One can always hear the neighbours above or the blaring cars outside, and even the sound of water being run in other rooms. Honestly, it was worst on day one of our stay  we got used to the noise pretty quickly, but it is a consideration when booking.

<Content>Nice hostal I stayed for a weekend in hostal Barrera. I make a reservation in this hostel after reading all the previous good reviews. I booked the room directly with them, they answered very quickly my email and didn't have problems with reservation.It's a good hostel with a superb location (really near everything you would like to visit if you are a tourist in Madrid).Room was very clean, and the people who manage the property are really helpful and nice... (mother and daughter make a special atmosphere but you don't have the feeling of being controlled....).If I have to say a bad thing, I can only say that in the mornings life start quite early (but this is a problem of all type of hostels -and some hotels- you can always hear everything from your room, so if the people from the rooms near you leave early, and they speak loudly, you would be got up...).I would return again to Hostal Barrera in my next visits to Madrid.

<Content>5 estrellas I booked this hostal for our first stay In Madrid based on Tripadvisor rating. The booking process direct with the hostal was easy. A telephone call the day before our arrival to ensure that we could check in in the early afternoon also came with the advice to take a taxi from Atocha station to the hostal because the street is on a fairly long slope--I wish we had listened because Nieves was right! After that we consulted Nieves every day on all sorts of matters and she was a mine of information which helped us to make the most of our stay. Nieves' mother Dona Lucina was also a star and took charge of our laundry. Overall it was ultra clean, very friendly and hospitable and perfectly situated for all the cultural and tourist sites-we will be back...Elizabeth

<Content>Excellent stay Stayed there for 3 nights in October and was exactly what we needed. Clean comfortable and exceptionally friendly with a fantastic location. If you're looking for 5* star hotel luxury you shouldn't be looking to stay here, but as Hostals go this is pretty much perfect. Great location for Santa Ana and pretty much all sights.

<Content>Very Enjoyable Stay We decided to stay at Hostal Barrera as it was highly recommended to us, and we were not disappointed. It's centrally located (5 to 10 min from the train station and 3 museums). All other major sights in the downtown area are within walking distance. We did not need to take public transportation to get around. Despite being on a busy road, there was minimal noise from the street (windows were very soundproof). It's close to all the major sights and there are a lot of great restaurants in the neighborhood.When we arrived, we were welcomed by a very nice lady who provided valuable information such as restaurants where locals dined and the various sights (e.g. when to visit the museum for free admission). We learned quite a lot about Spain from our brief chats with her everyday. Every part of the room was clean and there was free wi-fi. Overall, Hostal Barrera offers great value. As Madrid was our first stop, our experience was a great start to our Spain trip. Thanks for your hospitality, Nieves!

<Content>I liked it! OK, reviews are by their very nature subjective but this small hostal is obviously doing something right as it seems to be always in tripadvisor's top 5 madrid hotels.although i visit spain regularly, i hadn't been to madrid before so wasn't sure how the barrera would compare against the other-much higher rated-places i have stayed at in iberia, however at the end of my stay i was pleased with my choice.i shalln't add a great deal to what has already been said;the hostal doesn't do food, it is well situated in a fairly central area, and is on a busyish road.yes on first sight it looks a little unsalubrious, but almost directly opposite is a 4 star hotel, and just down the road is another 4 star place so the area is actually fine.i didn't find the traffic noise a problem, although i was on a room that was on a side street there was some little background traffic noise but this didn't interfere with my sleep at all.what i would point out is that if you are planning on some bedroom action it may be worth giving this hostal a miss as the walls don't stop much in the soundproofing department, so any honeymooners would probably do well to go somewhere else!i stayed in a twin room-it was with my father-and although the room was fairly small it had been fairly recently decorated and the bathroom, again a little compact was also fairly newly done.the room was impeccably clean on arrival and was also cleaned well during my stay.however, what made this such an enjoyable experience was the absolutely delightful Nieves, the young lady on reception and who's family appears to own the hostal. her cheerful disposition and helpful manner was a credit to her and i felt you could ask her anything and not only would she be willing to help you but would have taken you to where you wanted to go if you asked!so whilst the amenities are a little basic the friendliness and eagerness of this young woman make the hostal barrera an ideal place to spend a few days in spain's capital.

<Content>Look no further... This hostal has to be one of the best finds we've had in a few years, which we booked on the strength of Trip Advisor recommendations.The welcome on arrival was warm and inviting, the best possible welcome to Spain,and the hostal is immaculately clean throughout. Although on a busy road, you really don't notice this at night as the double glazing works very well. The bathroom had a powerful shower with plenty of hot water, something that is not always the case! The hostal is very close to many of the main attractions and in an evening just a couple of minutes walk from Heurtas which is one of the lively tapas bar areas. The Metro is just a couple of minutes away.Many thanks to all of the family for making our stay pleasant and enjoyable. Nothing is too much trouble for them, be it information or the loan of an english adaptor! Should we return to Madrid, we'll definitely be back!

<Content>Wonderful !!!!! I decided to verify the quality of the 鈥淗ostal Barrera鈥? It seemed strange to me that a 2 stars Hostal was the N.1 in the Madrid Best Hotels Trip Advisor list. I did not have at all budget problem, as I was on a business trip, and I am used to sleep 90 / 100 days in 4 and 5 stars L hotels around the world and I do so since decades, so I have an idea about Hotel鈥檚 quality.First impression鈥he entrance is quite dark, you have two ramps before reaching the lift, 9 steps in total鈥k鈥t was not so impressive鈥han鈥?br/>The reception staff was perfect, I would like some reception staff belonging to the 鈥淟eading Hotels of The World鈥?to come here and learn something about how to receive a guest! I felt pampled since the first second till when I checked out.The reception was bright, the yellow colour is the dominant colour in the small lobby and in my room, a single room. A sort of a small nest where you have all what you need. Plasma TV on the wall, safety box!!!, multi jet shower!!! Stereo system in the room!!! Al was modern, functional, nothing was broken or out of order. I was looking for a stain on the lining an hair under the bed, some smell in the bathroom, just a small drop of shampoo on the shower plate. Nothing. Only CSI Miami probably are able to find an evidence of the previous guest. You can eat directly on the bathroom floor. It is one of the cleanest Hotel I have ever seen. Well what I can say. I paid 50 Euro / Night. It is an amazing Hotel not Hostal. Sometimes you find horrible 4 stars hotels like in Dubai or Paris, and this is a 2 stars!!! Negative points? Ok鈥ou do not have a mini bar in the room but cold beverages are available 24h at the reception, this speech is valid also for the hair dryer. A screw of the lid of the wc was not perfectly fixed so when you open the lid it slightly moves. Maybe you need one socket more in the room. Somebody told about noise from the street or other rooms. I have had a perfect sleep. Of course the Madrid Movida goes on all night long! Just use some wax for the ears and it will be all ok. In any case all the windows are double insulated and they are new. This will be definitely my choice in Madrid. It is a perfect Hotel, it was a perfect staying. And you are in the heart of the city and 2 minutes walking from a metro station. The Hostal Barrera is the Hotel N.1 in Madrid. No doubt. And I have compared it with the 5stars Hotel I was used to go since one month ago, during my staying in Madrid. I saved about 250 Euro per night!!!!!!!! during my staying in Hostal Barrera not bad at all I鈥檇 say!

<Content>Great hostal We started our vacation in Spain with two nights here. It was our first time at a hostal, so we were a bit unsure as to what to expect. But Hostal Barrera turned out to be far better value than most 3-star hotels we have stayed in in European cities. The staff was helpful and the room was modern and clean, with a flat screen TV. The bathroom had a nice shower cabinet with sufficient space and good water pressure. No moldy shower curtain, and no water on the floor! Anyone who has experienced the tiny bathrooms, the moldy shower curtains and the wet floors of the overpriced 3- stars in Paris or Rome will love this bathroom!We paid 68 Euros per night for a quiet room with a double bed, and found it to be excellent value. If you don't feel the need for facilities other than a helpful front desk staff and a nice room, don't hesitate to stay here.

<Content>Wonderful service and lovely hostal! It seems I will have to repeat what all the others have said, this hostal is excellent value for money, great location and the staff are lovely. Maria (?) was very helpful recommending places to eat, things to avoid and even informed us that the Prado Museum is free from 6pm to 8pm, and for EU residents, free on either a Tuesday or Wednesday!The Retro park is wonderful, and the row boats are a must. Its a fun 45 minutes for under 5 euro! The Huertas is so close, as is almost everything else. We were lucky enough to get a refurbished room and it was great, with a small plasma and great bathroom, the shower had wonderful water pressure. No Minibar or fridge, but this isn't a problem when so many bars offer free tapas! Highly recommend this hostal, and as another reviewer said, if its good enough for Martin Sheen... :)

<Content>OK...But It's still a Hostal I needed a place to stay on a Saturday night 2 weeks before being in Madrid, all thanks to being jerked around by Rail Europe. I give the Barrera full marks for keeping me on file until a room became open. We stayed two nights in two rooms as our time bookended a trip to and from Barcelona. The second night impressed me more as the room was brightly decorated and the bathroom was nicely tiled. At 68 euros a good value certainly. Also it had AC, great. Otherwise, I must say the first impressions were completely underwhelmimg. The district, if not exactly tacky cannot be called beautiful either. You have to ring the door so that someone let's you in, walk through a dark hall, lug your bags up some steps to a non-descript reception area. The people at the front desk are very nice. Some were more proficient in English than others.There are a lot of hostals and pensiones around Atocha railway station that cater to the backpacking crowd. Within this context I can see how perhaps the Barreras can be viewed as a great find. I would consider staying here again due to the value and proximity to the station. But #1 in a city this beautiful? I don't think so.

<Content>Great hotal Stayed 3 nights in June. I`ve just re read the previous reviews and rather than re write it all I will just say that I agree with them.You`ve probably decided to book by now so instaed of a review here are a few tips. On leaving Anton Martin Metro ( an unlimited toursit pass for 3 days is 9.5 euros and covers trips to the airport , a must) walk downhill on the right and look out for the hostal, its not far and we walked past it .The area may appear a little grubby but its really ok and nothing to worry about . There are some tappas bars over the road down a side street called Fuker street ( thats correct) most were fine but 2 bars took advantage charging way over the odds for 2 wines ( going rate was 2 euros but these bars charged 8 and 10 ) . Some push raciones ( big plates of food) although the tapas are free. Strangely, better tappas bars a short walk away towards the city centre.Basic toiletries and towels are provided so need need to pack these if on a short stay .Off licence a few doors up for cold drinks and there was no fridge in the room .TV. If you press anoulougue on the remote insted of digital you find english speaking CNN, I figured this out on the last day !Our room was double glazed so dont worry about the noise. On the last day we found cable cars to a small theme park in Madrid , if this is your thing google before you go or when there like I did thanks to the free wi- fi . Happy Days.

<Content>Great location, friendly staff, good value We booked a last minute trip to Madrid for the first bank-holiday weekend in May and really struggled to find any accommodation. After reading the great reviews for Hostal Barrrera I contacted them directly, all the rooms were full but they did have an apartment in the same building for 鈧?00 per night which we snapped up. When we arrived we were met by a very friendly lady on reception who told us that the apartment was in the basement. I was a bit worried at first but the apartment couldn't have been better. It was brand new and really nicely furnished with an open-plan living room and kitchen area, separate bathroom and bedroom, tv, cd player etc. We were only the 2nd group of people to have stayed here. We spent 3 nights here and never experienced any problems with noise from the street outside. The location is excellent - we walked everywhere and didn't use the metro at all. One of the girls on reception gave us some really good suggestions for places to eat/drink locally and marked them all out on a map for us. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, accomodation was great, and location fantastic - wouldn't hesitate in recommending Hostal Barrera to anyone looking for a short-break in Madrid.

<Content>Fantastic location in Madrid Spent lovely three nights at this hotel (room 215) end May 2008. Really friendly staff, lovely clean and refurbished room. Really good value. The location is unbeatable - you can walk to all the sights, including the three main (excellent) Galleries, Plaza Mayor, Plaza Santa Anna etc. There are also lots of restaurants and Tapas bars around the side streets of Huertas. Overall, highly recommended. Jon and Tracy.

<Content>Barrera What A Gem Stayed at Hostel Barrera for three nights in April and as usual previous favourable reviews were very accurate.We received a very friendly welcome and all the staff throughout our stay could not do enough for you.The Hostel was very clean throughout and is in a great position for most of Madrids attractions .It is easy to find just a very short walk from Anton Martin metro station . One thing to note is if you are using the metro from the airport 10 tickets will cost you 8.90 euros not 6.90 as you have to pay a one euro supplement per person for the airport line.

Its staff is helpful and friendly, and will do laundry for you for small fee. Has cheap bottled water for sale. And open 24 hours. Steps away from the Prada and other great museums. Even Martin Sheen stayed there!I almost didn't want to write this review 'cos I don't want too many people know about this place and make it too popular!

<Content>Great staff makes up for noise What a location! Don't think it could get much better in Madrid. Close to the major museums, main train station, restaurants and a metro stop, Anton Martin. However the Hostal is on Atocha Ave which is a main and very busy street, with nonstop traffic, so our room was quite noisy. You can hear talking and the boom of the elevator too. The staff here is some of the nicest and most helpful you could ever ask for. Great value for the price just don't forget to pack earplugs. The room was very clean a good size.

<Content>Lovely place to stay We stayed at the Hostal Barrera recently and had a wonderful stay. The rrom had recently been refurbished, complete with flat screen Sony TV on the wall. Ok, all channels in Spanish, but at least you can find out what the weather is and catch up on the local news. We were worried about the noise, as other travellers had said, but we did not expereince any problems at all, and the Hostal requests that all travellers do not make any noise after 12 midnight. it it just wise to remember that you are staying in the capital of Madrid and the traffic stops for no one! The Hostal is excellently placed for the three main Art centres, with the Reina Sofia two streets behind the hostal, couldn't be better. Best of all are the familyt that run the Hostal,where else could you be welcomed, with the key to your door ready and a ready smile. Excellent restaurants were recommended and tapas bars for the more adventourous. This is the place to stay in Madrid

<Content>very kind staff, excellent for a short stay My wife and I spent two nights at Barrera last Jenuary. nice and bright room, good size bathroom and very very kind staff. excellent location. Most of places are walkable in just 5 min at most. The only down side is that rooms are a little noisy, not only from the street but also from the other rooms. Still I find it an excellent choice for a short stay in Madrid

<Content>Excellent hostal. Like a very good hotel Hostal Barrera, is a very good quality hostal. It is very clean and has a very good service as a hostal. Also, the location is very confortable. All the important museums and monument are very close to the hostal. The subway is just a few meters from the hostal. The employers speak english. If i'll go to Madrid again, I'll prefer it.

<Content>Nice but noisy If cleanliness is top of your list of priorities then this is the place for you. Spotless; couldn`t fault it and the staff were friendly and efficient. The rooms were a bit on the small side, but well laid out and everything seemed quite new. Big negative was the noise. Relentless traffic all night; there may be some rooms further down the side street which might be quieter, not sure. The workmen clattering and banging upstairs from 8am until 11pm on a couple of days were another distraction. The location was handy for the three galleries and an enjoyable (but not short) walk to the city centre (Sol). Having seen the area described in another review as `seedy` I would say that was a bit of an exaggeration; I`d say it was more down-at-heel and we never felt unsafe walking back at night. There is a `Sex Center` a few doors down, but apart from the name on the front it`s quite discreet though be prepared for the kids asking what a peepshow is!

<Content>Fantastic! My wife and I stayed here for two months in November 07 and we loved the place. We were early for check-in, so they held our luggage and gave us a quick list of things to do (and places to eat) until the room is ready. The room was incredible. They told us it was renovated 5 years ago, but I could have sworn they did it a week ago. All brand new modern (think IKEA-like) furniture, flat screen TV, immaculate bathroom. You have to turn in the key when you leave the room, and then pick it up when you return. That involves ringing the buzzer so they let you in the building and climbing a set of stairs to the reception room. We encountered 3 receptionists throughout our stay and they were all exceptionally friendly. This is a great place for not very much money at a great location in the city. We took the metro to it from the airport to save money. We had to take a taxi back to the airport because it was too early in the morning and that cost us about 30 euro. I highly recommend this hostal.

<Content>great location and value Got this premises on T.A. This is a great location, 3/5 minute walk to the Prado,Reine Sofia,Retiro park,2 minutes to Anton Martin Metro.As a confirmed wanderer it was so easy to locate your bearings ie Paseo de Prado,C/Atoche or Rondo Atoche all easily found and en route to/from most tourist attractions.The host family are very friendly and keep it spotless.I would have no hesitation in recommending it.Tip-from the airport get the metro line 8 to mar de crystal,then 4 northbound to pinar de chamartin,then 1 southbound to anton martin.It looks awkward but you should be seated on 1 through your journey and this avoids the changes or crowds in the busier stations.

<Content>A winner! We stayed at the Hostal Barrera from 24 Nov-28 Nov 2007. We arrived at noon, but were told our room wasn't ready, but that they would hold our luggage while we toured Madrid. We came back around 3pm and our room was ready. It was small (per usual in Europe) but well-appointed with everything you would need. Comfortable bed, tiny bathroom with sink, toilet, and shower, satellite TV (that we barely used), and wi-fi that we used daily. The room was quiet at night, but during the day after 9am there was construction going on in the area. The room was also a little warmer than we would have liked.The hotel is in a great neighborhood, close to the Anton Martin Metro on the #1 line, about a 45 minute ride (with 2 changes) to the airport. It's 2 stops to the Atocha train station. Within a 10 minute walk, you can be at the Prado or the Reina Sofia museums. The neighborhood also has numerous shops and a supermarket a block away, convenient for snacks and drinks. A winner, and we'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great service Hostal Barrera's staff was great, went well beyond their expectations to help us during our stay.The room was the one I liked the best in our trip to Europe (it was better than a certain 3 star hotel we stayed in Paris!). It was a small room but VERY clean and quiet.Location was great, close to the metro and many attractions like El Prado and Parque el Retiro.

<Content>Great deal! We arrived at the hostal at ~2am. It's very hard to identify from the street and looks somewhat dark and uninhabited, but don't be fooled. This is much nicer than your typical hostal - excellent full bath, a/c, tv, etc. We were so pleasantly surprised. Maria was a wealth of information and such a great resource in planning our activities while in Madrid.

<Content>Great value I spent 6 nights in June at the Hostal Barrera, and found it to be excellent value for the money (45 euros per night for a single). I love to walk, and the convenience to the metro, the Atocha train station, and the big 3 museums (Prado, Thyssen-Bornemisza, and Renia Sofia) is a huge plus. Note that it wouldn't be good for the handicapped, because the street is somewhat sloping. The immediate neighborhood isn't super trendy, and generally I found more hip bars and restaurants elsewhere, but there were some local places to eat at reasonable prices. As other reviewers have mentioned, the family that runs the hostal is super helpful, like explaining to me exactly how to find the bus station going to Segovia, or arranging a taxi to the airport for me at 5 am. My room was a single, and thus small, but it was very clean, particularly the bathroom which had new fixtures. Air conditioning worked well. I could hear a bit of noise from the other guests-- it wasn't bad, particularly by spanish standards, but it isn't soundproofed or anything. The hostal is on busy street, but most of the rooms overlook a side street and I couldn't hear the traffic noise unless someone honked their horn. Overall, it wasn't the ritz, but I could never afford to stay at the ritz anyway! When assessing value for the money, the Barrera ranks a 5.

<Content>A Great Place We stayed at Hostal Barrera twice within the past couple of months. On each occasion, the management (especially Maria and Josefa) were very friendly and helpful. The location couldn't be more convenient; easy walking distance to almost everything we wanted to see. Plus a Metro Station is within a couple of minutes away, and Madrid's main railroad station (Atocha) is less than an easy (and safe) 10 minute walk away. Easy to book over the internet, with excellent communication back to you from the staff. Yes, there is a little noise from the outside, but not enough to keep most people awake nights. Air conditioning works great, rooms are clean, and up to date.

<Content>Three time's the charm Last month saw our 3rd stay at the Hostal Barrera and, again, we weren't disappointed. Situated conveniently on Calle Atocha (just 2 blocks from Metro Anton Martin), this small hotel has a family-run feel to it. Rooms are simple, comfortable but tastefully decorated. The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. And for 60鈧?a night - within walking distance to the Grand Via and Madrid's major museums - it's a steal!

<Content>Fantastic hotel After my husband and I visited Madrid in March , I returned with my sister-in-law to visit this wonderful city. I chose the Hostel Barrerra again and was not dissapointed.We shared a twin room and found this room also to be clean, fairly spacious and quiet. Obviously when we opened the window some noise could be heard, but then again the hotel is situated in just about the best location in Madrid, so the street outside does get busy.Everything is within walking distance and the best way to see the city is on top of the tourist bus which leaves the prado museum about 10mins walk from the hotelThe main railway station is only 5 mins away and is great for a day trip to Toledo.My sister in law was amazed that this hotel costs so little but offers a safe, clean and friendly environment in a capital city.W shall be returning to Madrid with hubbies in tow to stay at this great hotel.

<Content>Convenient and good value for budget travelers in Madrid The location of this hotel is hard to beat - right between the museums and other part of town with all the major sites. The room was very small, but very clean and the bathroom was updated and very clean as well. There is no breakfast available and laundry is very expensive. The manager is wonderful and very helpful.

<Content>Great location We stayed in this hostal for seven nights and found it to be clean, comfortable, well located and staffed by English speakers. It only took around 45 minutes to travel from the airport by metro and the main Attocha station is only 10 minutes away - a trip to Toledo is to be recommended. Although breakfast is not included there are plenty of places nearby that serve coffee and croissants/tortilla etc. for around 3 Euros. The main museums and parks are very close - we liked the Retiro ( especially the Rose Garden), the Botanical Gardens and the Reina Sofia Museum. if you can, definitely go to see Real Madrid, or at least do the great stadium tour. I will be staying here again ( I hope).

<Content>ok for money stayed 2 nights to see madrid football game . Hotel in central location but slightly seedy location close to metro stop. Room ok for price and bed comfortable though pillows terrible Reception friendly though restaurant suggestions erratic. We booked an inside room as street noise a problem in Madrid so quiet apart from doors slamming from late night revellers . Would use again at this price level. Bathroom small but other rooms had bigger ones. Finally would concur with comments on metro pickpockets as my wallet stolen . Suggest you dont carry wallet

<Content>Sleepless in Madrid..... I booked this place because of the raving reviews on this site.The night was a symphony of constant noise from the street, with every noise several neighboring rooms had to offer: I even heard people in different rooms caugh- and I heard everyone's alarm clocks!The next morning I checked out. Since I originally booked 5 nights, I had to pay for 2 nights even though I only stayed one night- but it was worth it just to move out!Note also that while the location is not very far from the center,- there are far better locations at similar prices not to mention quality- such as the hotel I moved into after checking out from this one.The bed was uncomfortable- though to be fair- the room was clean, and the people were fairly nice. But given the place is now number 2 on Tripadvisor- don't assume it鈥檚 a seal of quality- and don't make the same mistake I did!

<Content>Set the bar for hostels After Hostal Barrera as my first hostel experience, everything else seems horrible in comparison. The rooms are clean and nice, there are private bathrooms, its in a GREAT location, and the service is the nicest I've come across. I stayed there for a few days while I looked for a place to live in the city, and they made me feel so welcome in a strange country, helped me out in every way. I was sad to leave. Amazing price, amazing place.

<Content>Great value I stayed in Hostal Barrera with my girlfriend last month, and it was a great choice. The hostal is located near all major attractions and some steps away from the metro station (it's also close to the Atocha train station). The room is simply decorated but very clean and comfortable, with TV, air conditioning and a nice bathroom. The street may be a litlle noisy, but once the window was closed we didn't hear anything from outside. The neighborhood, although isn't the best in Madrid, wasn't frigthening at all. I totally recommend it!
