<Content>two twelve hour shiftsh well, where do i shtart...shcrambled or fried.... that is the breakfast choice.i've climbed easier mountains, i now have calfs like house bricks because of the incline on the stairs. don't get locked out of your room because nobody will come to your help because of two twelve hour shiftsh, you'll have to hope there is another room open for you to find shelter on a floor... this is all true. don't leave razor blades out as when we were there there was a phanton eye brow trimmer. We were on a stag do and i strongly believe that hostel is kitted out for this sort of trip and this only. on a good note the location is spot on.

<Content>horrendous I think it's safe to say that this accommodation ruined my whole experience of Amsterdam. Luckily I was there only for 2 nights, as I don't think I would have survived a third. To be fair, we did not stay in the normal part of Hotel Brian but a sort of annex, a few doors down. In this part of the hotel there is no reception and no one there to help if you happen to need it. Nevermind the stairs, as there's not much you can do about the extraordinarily steep tiny stairs in Amsterdam, but the rooms were shockingly basic. I know it's a hostel. But that doesn't mean that it has to be foul. We paid a whopping 100 euro for a 4 bed room (4 friends traveling) and it was disgusting. The light in the ONLY bathroom in the building (that served I think at least 4 other rooms) was out. Which meant having to go to the toilet with the door open! I also think the other guests in the hostel were part of the terrible stay - all young, drunk males, who not only kept us up all night with their loud singing and hollering, but apparently also could not tell the difference between the toilet bowl and the floor. So you can imagine what the bathroom with no light looked like the next morning. I might add that this bathroom was also the only one with a shower. I did not shower, or go to the toilet in the hostel the entire weekend I was there. Surprisingly, this was not cleaned up (nor was the light fixed) while we were there.We also had been told breakfast was served until 10:30am, so seeing as we had gotten no sleep thanks to the other guests, we decided to sleep in and go for breakfast at 10am. But at 10am breakfast was closed and we couldn't get any since the girl wanted to go home. This was just the first night staying here. I can't say the second one was any better. Stay away from this place. It's not worth it whatsoever. Amsterdam can be a charming city full of culture and has many other beautiful places that are not expensive (we had already tried but they were booked) so don't let that be ruined by staying in such a shoddy place - so just look around, book ahead and save yourselves before having to settle on this place!

<Content>I wouldn't stay here if you paid me! My partner and I had booked 4 nights stay at Hotel Brian for July 2008. When we arrived we were able to check straight into our room. They only took cash so we arranged to put our bags in our room and go get more cash out. Trying to get up the stairs to the top floor was like climbing a ladder. The stairs were so steep  small it was nearly impossible with backpacks. If you had a suitcase you wouldn't be able to get up the stairs. Once on the top floor (3rd or 4th floor) we entered our Double Room with Shared Bathroom facilties. We were due to pay $87AUD per night for this room. The lock on the door was faulty. The room was unbelievably small, smelly and not particularly clean. The 'Double Bed' was more like a single cot on the floor. And the room had no furniture. I have no doubt in my mind there would have been bed bugs. The roof was just a skylight that was covered in dirt and the window was small  dirty with bars across. To make matters worse, the toilet was filthy and the shower/bathroom was OUT OF ORDER! That was the last straw for us so we went downstairs, paid for the first night to be fair and left to find other accommodation. I definitely would not recommend this place unless you are extremely tight on money and don't mind sleeping in filth. This is more like a really bad hostel than a hotel.

<Content>budget is not bad! We have just come back from Amsterdam and would recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a cheap bed with really good atmosphere and really helpful staff. We kicked off with a bit of a problem but it was ironed out and we even got a free coke while we were waiting. Breakfast is bread, eggs and jam - you can get your own tea and coffee or get a soft drink from the vending machine (inc beer!).The rooms are basic - room for a bed and not much else, but we didn't go on holiday to stay in a hotel room anyway! - the canal view is beautiful.The staff are all really friendly and the place has a really laid back atmosphere. Yes we have stayed in hotels with bigger rooms and ensuite etc, but not with the same good atmosphere.

<Content>A Pleasant Surprise for the Price. Well well well, after reading the reviews on this website, me and my two friends thought we were in for four nights in hell, but we were so relieved when we got there! The staff we met were nice enough, the hostel is central to everything (we were put in brian's sister hostel, hotel liberty), and the room (we booked a three person room), though a little dingy and small, is what we payed for. Our room was quite clean, the beds surprisingly cosy, and the toilet/bathing facilities cleaned regularly.I do agree, our window view was a lot to be desired (a wall), plus if we hadn't had our details printed off the booking website they would have put us down for 3 nights due to a mix up, but we really didnt have a bad stay. The steep stairs to our floor just added to the dutch charm. We payed for four nights what it would have cost for maybe one night in london. There was a breakfast, but we always just missed it, however I'm sure i would have been satisfied with toast and eggs.It is basic accomodation, but the location and the lack of curfew make it worth more than they charge.

<Content>50/50 response some good some bad This is not a bad place to stay if you really are on a budget. I found that staff were not too helpful with the whole explaining breakfast so had to enquire what we were to do. We were told to be down for breakfast @ 8am and went down and waited for half an hour to be served raw eggs. The scrambled egg is fine along with the toast, fresh bread. Thats the complete breakfast menu! Has a coffee machine for tea and coffee which was nice and you could help yourself all day to that which was a good thing. The rooms were small but were clean and the bed linen was clean. Overall for the money it was good I would only say that the staff could have been slightly more helpful.

<Content>worst experince in hotels ever I was currently working in Amsterdam and staying at a hostel till my house was finally sorted out.The hostel was booked that weekend so i thought I would stay at hotel Brian.I booked my weekend on the tuesday before,with an eastern european girl at the desk.I didnt get a receipt or piece of paper.ok I thought and thought no more of it.When i got there on the saturday morning with my luggage, I was welcomed by a sleazy american guy in a tracksuit and baseball cap.Low and behold they had no booking or record of me-this guy and a rather strict unpleasent dutch manageress, I think she was, asked who i had booked with-i said an eastern european girl on tuesday ,and they both looked at each other expectantly, the manageress saying why does she do this to me?as if she makes a habit of it.I have to say I went crackers. I was severly p****d off and the manageress turned very nasty.This sleazy american got really sarcastic and couldnt really bothered to help.Boy was he creepy.Something played by Peter Stormore.One other guy there, South African ,who used to work there arranged for me to be taken round the corner to a place called Hotel Tamara.It was owned by same management. As i was leaving I shouted to the manageress thanks for a lovely stay and she told me to [--] off.But this was in front of the other customers at the hotel.PR not her strong point..The hotel Tamara I had to pay for at least 2 days and it cost me an extra 30 euros more than what i was expecting to pay at hotel Brian and the place was horrendous....It cost 100 euros ..The room was like a cupboard---I mean a cupboard.The guy behind the desk was an old guy from Australia,whom I noticed had to have his trousers down at the back ,permanantly having his backside hanging out at the back.....lets just say i kept my door well and truly locked at night.I felt really sorry for a few people there on holiday...eg mothers and their children.they probably thought they were getting a good deal.sorry folks,with cheap in Amsterdam ,you are not even getting false economy-you are getting total [--].And I lived in Amsterdam for 8 months and got sick of people getting ripped off by this city..hotel Brian is a good example of this.AVOID at all costs.

<Content>People Partyinh My friend booked this for a stag do and 33 of us had a great time, the people who run the hotel were warm and friendly and gave us some really helpful local tips on where to avoid and what to do.A really excellent time, they were kind and helpful and allowed us to have a good party.The facilites are a little basic but, if you want a party hotel then give then a call and say that Big Al and his friends recommended the place.Top Class

<Content>Not great, but not *that* bad There have been some really bad reviews for this hotel here but I think it's not *that* bad. I stayed at this same hotel almost 20 years ago and went back again recently - a lot can change in 20 years. I'll start off with a plus: It's very conveniently located within walking distance to Centraal Station.And now for the rest: We were scolded a bit by the woman at reception for being late - it certainly wasn't our fault that our flight was four hours late departing from the U.S. and I certainly wasn't going to call them from the U.S. to tell them we would be arriving late. She then proceeded to try to charge us 10 euro more per night than what we'd been quoted via email. Luckily, I had a copy of the email with me and once she saw that I had been quoted the price and had back and forth emails with her boss, her attitude changed quickly for the better.However, I think we were given the worst double room possible for arriving late - it was about the size of a closet directly across from the toilet. The double bed is not much bigger than a twin, but overall, it was clean enough. The bath and shower were also clean enough and there were no fleas/bedbugs.The Hotel Brian is not the kind of place you stay in if you expect to sleep (rather thin walls with people having lots of fun in their rooms), but most of the people working there are friendly, laid back and it's a bit of a family atmosphere at breakfast. They did not ask us to do our own dishes like another reviewer wrote. We could have had eggs, but chose to have toast with peanut butter and coffee that you can serve yourself.If you're expectations are low, and you want a cheap, central place to stay in Amsterdam, this hotel might suit your needs just fine. For me, I think I've outgrown it and will find another hotel the next time I'm in Amsterdam.

<Content>Great city - awful hotel! I have recently returned from my son鈥檚 stag weekend where we were booked into the Hotel Brian as a group of 21. We had already read the comments on this site and were pretty disappointed and apprehensive about what we were going to find. Well to my amazement it was worse than expected, 3 of the guys just about turned and booked elsewhere immediately.On our arrival we were told that the price of the rooms had gone up due to the drop in the 拢 and that we all needed to pay an extra 47 Euros (we stayed for 3 nights) each. We then had to pay 20 Euros for each key that was to be refunded when we handed them in at the end of our stay, which we had to fight to get back! We were then allocated rooms, some 4, some 5 and a couple of 2 men rooms. They were all basic with old metal framed beds with badly stained and dirty mattresses and ripped and torn sheets. The 5th bed in the 5 man rooms was a mattress on the floor and some of the 2 man rooms had a 'double bed'! Just what you need on a stag night! The place was very run down, showers on some floors didn't work, and breakfast was awful - highly not recommended even if it鈥檚 just somewhere to crash after a night on the pop!

<Content>Gross don't do it is my advice If you are a stoner and you are having a wild weekend and just want somewhere to crash then this is the place for you. it has internet and TV downstairs, coffee most of the day and cheap booze in the vending machine and the staff are friendly enough but if you want to spend any time in your room forget it. We got there and our room was disgusting. Walls had gross stains up them (I don't even want to think about it). It had a nasty smell and the sheets on every bed had stains on them. Again don't ask, there was sick, one sheet looked like a bike had been ridden up the middle of it and one had suspicious white stains lovely. After much complaining they did change them for us but what they changed them with wasn't much better. if you showered early then the showers were clean but they got dirty very quickly and it was easy to get stuck in them. Breakfast was ok but started about an hour later than advertised so if you want an early start you have to skip it. location by the canal not too bad but has red light ladies either side and doesn't make you feel particularly safe. Oh and stinks of weed of course. Steps are also incredibly steep so getting upstairs with a case is a no no. Not somewhere to stay if you don't want the run of the mill Amsterdam holiday.

<Content>Fleapit - Beware Horrible place. Ended up with lots of cute fleabites to show for our troubles. Got a room, or should i say cell, that had one very small horizontal window at ceiling height. This window looked out at ground level of someones roof garden, how very nice.The room was roasting hot, no air con and opening the window just let in mozzies. Never bothered with breakfast. The shared toilets were incredibly basic.If you want to have a reasonable holiday, avoid this hotel. If you dont care and are simply worried about price and are flea proof, then be my guest. The Hotel Brian, easily the worst hotel i have ever stayed in, one to be avoided.

<Content>The hotel sucks We booked at Liberty, but we had to go to hotel Brian to check in and our room was in this hotel as well. We booked a double room but got a twin one, the first thing which didn't go as planned. There was also told we had an own toilet and shower, this wasn't the case. The room was dirty, the breakfast was crappy and the fact we had to do our own dishes was the most ridiculous thing one can imagine in a hotel. The only good thing was the location, but there are also other hotels with a good location, they will never see me at this hotel again. Don't go there!

<Content>Value for money Hotel Brian is a good value for money - we paid 400 euros for 4 of us for 4 nights. Breakfast was indeed eggs! But there was also peanut butter and chocolate spread.  The room was 2 single beds and bunk beds, the mattresses were a bit on the squidgy side but not too bad! We had the ground foor quad and i would strongly advice against this as its right next door to the lounge area and it can be very loud (mainly the staff i might add!) until quite late and in the morning.There isnt a shower on the ground floor so we had to go up stairs for that (and ask for the towels) the shower is fine for the job - nothing special but this is a budget hotel.Most of the staff are really friendly none were rude or unaccommodating The location is perfect 10 minute walk to the station and 10 minutes into Dam square.

<Content>Hotel Brian Booked this hostel after seeing the good reviews on here. It was very easy to find, in a good location close to the Dam Square but not actually in the red light district, so pretty quiet.I paid 鈧?45 for the room for 3 nights which I felt was good value. All we needed on arrival was 鈧?0 for a key deposit, we paid in full the next day.If you are used to self-catering and 1* accommodation, you will be happy with this place. It is very basic, but comfortable. I had booked a double room through hostelbookers but they only had a twin with bunk beds on the day. I was not happy about this, but the bottom bed was ok for 2 people for a few nights. The room also had a sink, chair, wall-mounted shelf/table, open wardrobe and a safe which didn't work. It was small and functional, but clean and didn't smell. Smoking is allowed in rooms.The 2 friends we were with had not booked, but as we arrived fairly late at night the staff let them have the available quad room (2 singles and 2 bunks) for the same price. We ended up using this as a kind of living room through the day. My friends said their single beds were too short.I personally didn't feel that the staff were overly friendly, but they weren't unfriendly either and we had no problems with them. We did often heard them arguing with each other and with other guests, though.The building was nice and warm and the shared shower (there is one on each floor), though a little musty smelling, was clean and the water was hot and powerful. Towels and bedlinen are provided, but we had to ask for the towels.The walls are very thin and you can hear every word in the next room. The stairs are very steep and narrow, but there is a quad room on the ground floor which is easily accessible.The reception area has about 6 tables of four where you can sit and relax, though the chairs are the typical coffee-shop chairs, hard and uncomfortable. Smoking is allowed and there is a computer with free internet access and a TV. Breakfast is served here from 8-9.30am, I didn't have any, but it seemed to consist of mainly eggs and bread.There is a little kitchen where you can make tea and coffee and cook food if you want to.Round the back of the hotel are some prostitute's windows, but it is about a 5-10 minute walk to the proper red light district. Within a 5 minute walk from the hotel there are lots of coffee-shops, restaurants, Central Station and tram stops.I would recommend this place for travellers on a budget, backpackers, groups of friends and younger couples. I would not recommend it for people with children, people with mobility problems or people who like luxurious hotels that they can spend all day in.

<Content>Best Deal In Adam! I have stayed at the Hotel brian 6 times and will keep using it as my landing spot in Europe. The staff does a great job of making you feel at homeand and Alan has the info you need. Canal view that is worth alot more than they charge.My favorite coffee shop(The Gray area) is near by . The Brian is Cool, laid back and mostly quite.

<Content>Never want to leave Hotel Brian made our expirience in Amsterdam amazing. We ended up staying a week longer than we had scheduled, and they were very flexible, finding space for us at one of the three hostels they own, even when they were booked full. This was the only hostel I have ever visited that offered free internet and free breakfast. It's clean, right down the street from Amsterdam Centraal, and within 5 min walk from the city's best smart shops and coffeeshops. Amnesia, Grey Area, Any Day, two Bulldogs, InnerSpace, and many others are literally right around the corner. The staff kicks[-----] . The first day we arrived, we had been travelling through the UK, had gone 48 hours with no sleep and were exhausted. As soon as we entered, this guy Brent says You have a reservation? Great. Here try my new vaporizer and that's when we knew we were home.

<Content>A bargain, but watch out for ur wallet If you're on a tight budget Hotel Brian is definitly the place. For 25euro a night it is a bargain, since you get a central location in Amsterdam, a great view on the Singel canal, clean sheets and a clean shared bathroom, free breakfast, free coffee and tea all day, free internet. You can also use the kitchen to make your own food.However, on the downside, someone stole our money while we were at breakfast, some 200euro, and as I can see here, it has happened before in this hostel. I would go back to hotel brian only if there was no other way to afford a better place, and I would take my money with me even to the bathroom.

<Content>I loved the Hotel Brian I stayed at several hotels in Amsterdam before staying at the Hotel Brian and the hotel brian was my favorite. While the rooms weren't exactly the nicest looking, the sheets and bathrooms were clean, you got breakfast in the morning, and the people who stayed and worked there were fabulous, there was also a computer that you could use for free in the lobby. The price was also the best that we found while in Amsterdam. I definetly plan on staying there again.

<Content>Oh Brian is fab Why? Because it is clean  affordable. Luxurious? No but perfect if you plan to spend most of your time trampling around the eccentric city. Rooms were very clean, staff were extremely friendly and cooked us breakfast among other things that were offered. We had a great view and it was conveniently located to everything in the city. I loved it. I do not ever stay in ------ motels  I was satisfied. It is worth the money and has character. Small, yes but I would stay again.

<Content>friendly and cheap Don't normally write reviews but I saw that this hotel had got a bit of a slating from some people so thought I'd better redress the balance.YES the rooms ARE small, and YES the stairs ARE steep...but it's budget accomodation, in the heart of where you want to be in Amsterdam! It's walking distance from the station, two minutes from some of the best coffeeshops you're going to find and the staff are VERY welcoming and friendly. What more do you want??? If you're after luxury you pay 5 times as much and go elsewhere...there is no pretence at Hotel Brian, they offer cheap and clean accomodation for people who want an affordable trip to Amsterdam.The guy running it when we were there kept us happily entertained by just being him - open, down to earth and with a pythonesque kind of humour...and very helpful.Well recommended to anyone who isn't too whiney! - have fun!

<Content>Bad, Costly Experience for us... Unfortunately for us my boyfriend and I had a very bad experience whilst staying at this hotel (hostel). We had money taken from our locked room whilst at breakfast. Staff say that the safes in the rooms are broken and don't work but our's mysteriously was opened when returning to our room. We gather that whoever took the money had a key to the room then deposited the cash into the locked safe (they are always locked for this reason, hence the story they don't work) so as not to be seen/caught with the cash on them when exiting our room. Then when you leave the hotel for the day as we did someone then comes back into your locked room and unlocks the safe with their code and takes the cash. Fortunately for us the safe was not relocked properly and we put 2 and 2 together knowing we had not been able to unlock and access the safe ourselves. When reported to the police they were very aware of this scenario. No surprise whatsoeva to them, however staff had told us that they've never heard of it happening before earlier that day! They also have 2 other properties that may be mentioned when you are poached on the street outside central station (we later found out that this is illegal in amsterdam) Do yourself a favour and stay away, even if it seems a bargain price at 50 euro per night, it cost us sooo much more!

<Content>best place for 25 euros per night This was the best place in A'dam to stay and for 25 euros a night the best value too! If you want to stay in a clinical impersonal (and expensive!) hotel this isn't it, but there are plenty of those...(did i mention expensive 80-160 euros per night) Anyways these people know why you came to A'dam in the first place so they do try to make you feel comfortable... Just remember your key and if you are travelling with someone else make sure you travel together or you might be locked out! (the doors are locked after 11 i think...) Thanx....Brent from Canada

<Content>Ladder with Carpet Lets get things straight, This place is great if you don鈥檛 mind some compromise.I stayed on the Top Floor (Third Floor) Room 12, which I must say had its advantage..On the good side :No People traipsing past your door when you eventually get back (My Room).It鈥檚 a RoomIt鈥檚 DryIt鈥檚 SecureThe people are friendly enoughIt鈥檚 CheepThe Sheets are cleanClean ToiletsOn the Bad Side :Three Single beds and a Matress in the roomIn need of decoration Beds look like they come from a prisonStairs are so steep near the top they are more like a carpeted ladder on steroids.You can have breakfast and Drinks if you do it yourself and buy the ingredients.The Shower just has a small shelf to put all your stuff on.Personally I will stay elsewhere next time I am over in the dam.

<Content>Stairway to HELL The bedrooms were grotty. I was on the top floor and the stairs were like climbing a sheer rock face, I had climb up them on my hands and knees as they were not wide enough to take my foot. Wardrobe just an empty shell without a rail. I got two fried eggs thrown at me for breakfast. Worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Do yoursef a favour give it a miss!!

<Content>bulb it up BRIAN!!! Name says it all. (next door to a brothel ..what more can you say!) beer a euro under the guise of Fanta, love it. dont listen to the advise any of the staff give especially 'Bulb' as its basically all --------. They love the eggs! cheap and very cheefull, only stay there if you fancy recreating a hotel visit to Beirut circa 1982. But we absolutely loved it. Oh, and by the way, stay well clear of Cafe Los especially if you're a Welsh football fan - surreal isn't the word.

<Content>Brian surgery if you are just after a roof over your head at a cheap rate then this place is for you.If you are after getting into a heated argument about the morals of S Club Juniors with some of the colourful characters who frequent the lobby then this place is for you.If you want to sleep in a military issue bunk bed that has a vaseline label stuck to one of it's rusting supports then this place is for you.Wasn't really for me though......

<Content>ITS ALL YOU NEED Chances are within the first five steps you take out the door of Central Station you'll be approached by a Hotel Brian employee...My advice to you...take them up on the offer...Great location...cheap rates...free breakfast...clean towels...GUARANTEED hot water...excellent staff...1 euro heinies...free internet...liberal drug policy...the list goes on...Young or old its the place you wanna call home during your stay in Amsterdam...Sure...the rooms are small and you have to share the bathrooms and showers with the rest of the guests but they're always available when you need them...and if you need more than that it means your spending way too much time in your hotel anyways...this is Amsterdam we're talking about here folks...get out...walk...ride a bike...there's much more to do outside...you're on vacation right...Save the comforts of home for home...Its a GREAT place and I highly recommend it...

<Content>Great View of Singel Canal Excellent place for the guys. Women may not like to share the facilities. The place was clean, the staff was friendly, and it was very reasonably priced. I loved the view out the window of #12. Great proximity to everything, yet on a quiet canal. I'll go back!
