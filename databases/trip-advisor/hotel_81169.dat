<Content>No problems (except for noise outside) I was in San Francisco for four nights and stayed here in a single room with a shared bathroom and a female and male toilet nearby. The room was quite small but very cosy. It had a nicely made single bed, cable TV, closet, sink, toiletries, towels and a bathrobe. The view outside the window wasn't very nice - main street in front - and was very noisy especially at night. The room itself, as well as the shared bathroom and toilet, were very clean. The service was great. Overall I had a great stay with no problems. Decent price for San Francisco. Good for people on a budget. The location is quite good - close to Museum of Modern Art, Yerba Buena Gardens, Financial District and shops. Also within walking distance to Powell St station and bus stops. Probably won't return to San Francisco, but would stay here again if I did.

<Content>Relatively expensive We stayed for 4 nights. The room was clean and service good. But our room was tiny and located on the south side, so very very hot. To give you an idea: I had rinsed a pair of jeans and this was completely dry in about half a day. 90 USD is a lot for such a small and hot room.

<Content>Perfect location This is a great hotel if you would like to live close to everything in SF. It is small rooms but we didn麓t mind. We were just sleeping there. Nice and clean and we had toilette and shower in the room. The breakfast was poor, just a muffin and coffee.

<Content>The Mosser is Charming I visited San Francisco for a conference and was happy to find a reasonably priced hotel within walking distance to Union Square. The Mosser has a fabulous location for walking around the city and is convenient for public transit. The hotel is very charming and I found all of the staff to be friendly and very helpful. My only complaint would be that my room was not very well insulated from noise, but that is probably due to the age of the original building with its victorian architecture. My room was very nicely decorated and very clean. The shared toilets and shower were also spotless and I never had to wait to use either of the facilities. Great value and the hotel staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Be sure to check out the daily rate special on The Mosser's website for a great price.

<Content>Loved the Mosser, great location and very accomodating I went last minute to San Francisco to do the women's marathon. They had just had a cancellation so I booked it. The price was perfect. I needed to be near the start line, which I was. It was very charming, not your usual impersonal hotel. It was clean and cozy. The restaurant was very accommodating to my needs for the race. It was close to shopping, art museums and the race. I just took the bart from the hotel and I was there, no need for a car or a taxi. I would stay there again.

<Content>Memories of The Mosser Margaret and I stayed at The Mosser for three nights in August 2007. We had pre-booked this 3 star Hotel because it was affordable and central. It was just right for our needs, with a pleasant marble floored lobby and efficient staff. Muffins and coffee for breakfast. The room was compact but adequate, and there was a Jazz CD gift in the room produced by the owner. We opted to book a room without a bathroom, however the toilet and shower facilities on our floor were modern and clean. The Mosser has had an ungrade and so it has old Victorian charm and a modern freshness too. Within a few hundred metres you have diners and restaurants, picture theatre, the Cable Car, trams along Market Street, Union Square and the main shopping centre. If you are looking for 3 star comfort, reasonable price and a central location, then we are happy to recommend The Mosser.

<Content>Great for the money! Can't beat the location for access to public transportation and shopping! I got a queen room with shared bath for $109, but after numerous difficulties with the card key to the room door not working properly, was upgraded to a queen with private bath right across the hall. Nice to get the Gillette Venus disposable razor as one of the amenities.Even though I used the shared bath for just the first day, there was never a wait and both the toilet room and bathtub/shower room were spotless! I never even saw anyone else using the hall bathrooms. Friendly, couteous staff. The mini muffins and tea/coffee were nice in the mornings. I felt as if I were the only guest from the U.S. staying here--lots of Europeans seemed to stay there. The Hotel Palomar next door looked more swanky (and $$$), and the 39th floor Sky bar across the street at the Marriott was fun for a good view and a drink, but this was the best value by far, since I'm a girl on a budget. Would stay here again.

<Content>Great Service at the Mosser! My girlfriend and I stayed at the Mosser for two nights in August. Overall, the experience was very pleasant. Although the rooms are small, they are nicely decorated and reminiscent of a European boutique hotel. The best part of the hotel is the service. The staff is well informed and courteous, and, because the hotel is small, one never feels overwhelmed or rushed. The location is great too. It's right around the corner from the major shopping districts and transportation hubs. A nice restaurant next door, and an excellent breakfast diner down the block are also added amenities. If you're willing to forsake room size for good service and a nice price, you couldn't do better than the Mosser.

<Content>Great Stay I was making a quick trip through San Francisco and stayed here one night, and loved this hotel. It has a great location to almost any attraction in the city. The bedroom was very small, but I was in it only to sleep. The hotel was very very clean and for being in the big city I heard no noise. I travel to the Bay Area often and this is always my first choice.

<Content>Great little place I am a budget traveler. I wanted to goto SanFran but was worried about the high cost. I found the Mosser online and gave it a try. The rooms are small. But no smaller than New York hotels. They were pretty bare bones too. But they had a TV, sink, and a very comfortable bed. The staff were very professional. The location was perfect. I highly recomend the Mosser to anyone going to SanFran.

<Content>Stay here only if you plan to spend NO time in your room Location - superior. Immediate access to everything that the Bay Area has to offer, or at least immediate access to access, with MUNI and BART lines only a block and a half away.Rooms - taller than they are wide. A bed around which you can just about sidle; no desk; no closet; no bureau; a corner sink in the bedroom; a bathroom with tub, toilet, and a square yard of other space, most of which is within the doorsweep. I found myself placing bits and bobs (a plastic chair, a tray, a bizarre vase and artificial flower) out into the hall for the maid to carry away. The decor: Classic mottled hide-the-stain mixed browns, hiding the many stains with only indifferent success. Remarkably depressing, and with window-rattling street noise even on the eighth (top) floor.Stingy amenities - free coffee and muffins in the morning, all very well, it's not a bed-and-breakfast, after all; but oh, the cheeseparing of making the guests sign on every day, at $9.99 per day, for access to the Internet! One clerk said - It's not that bad, there's a three-day special fee. But when I went looking... No. One day at a time. On reporting that to the same clerk, he said - Huh! Did they pull that? Guess it wasn't making enough money. And there you have it, eh?Staff - Well-informed and chipper at the front desk. As for porters, chambermaids - one lift only, so that you must be prepared to wait for it to pass you by several times until this and that cart has made its way up or down. Better training might have ensured that they step out of the cab when a guest wants to use the lift.

<Content>The tiniest rooms ever! We booked the Mosser as I thought it looked like a gorgeous boutique hotel when I found it on hotels.com. When we arrived there we were really impressed with the exterior of the building and the lobby is absolutely gorgeous - beautiful architectural details.It was only when we got to the room that we realised the mistake that we had made. The rooms are quite stylish but they are absolutely tiny. I had read lots of reviews on this site before booking and figured that when people had said the rooms were small that they were exaggerating. There was just about 2ft on one side of the bed and less than 1ft on the other side. At the end of the bed there was about 3ft. As myself and my husband both had suitcases (mine was a small and his was a medium) we couldn't open our cases in the room without putting our cases on the bed and there was no wardrobe to hang things (well there was a 1ft rail but my husband hung 3 shirts on it and it was full!). Also attached to the end of the bed was a shelf with a tv perched on it, which without fail, I kicked repeatedly during the night (and I'm only 5ft 3). Also, the view out of our window was of other rooms - about 6ft away, so we had to keep the blind closed at all times.The Mosser would be an alright place to stay for one night, but after 3 nights there I had cabin fever from the size of the room (even though we were out early every morning until late in the evening seeing San Francisco) and I was so glad to get out of it.

<Content>Lovely gem in the City by the Bay I was in San Francisco at the beginning of October and I spent two nights at the Mosser Hotel which exceeded my expectations. Its location is ideal, right by Union Square in the heart of downtown, close to BART and the MUNI transit systems and of course the shopping. Upon my arrival at the hotel, the bellman asked for my name and it was obvious the hotel was expecting me. That's very organized. The bellman took my bags into the lobby which is very quaintly decorated. The old style decor is well preserved and maintained which adds to the charm. Checking in was simple and my room was immaculately clean. I didn't mind the size of the rooms (it's an old hotel built in the early 1900's) nor did I mind sharing the bathroom/shower facilites. I'm a budget traveller and I had no problems with using the shower facilites. (they are private so there is no communal shower to worry about) The front desk staff were very helpful in providing information during stay. I'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>European-style hotel, good price When we started looking for hotels in SF, the big price tags were a shock. We went through otel.com and got a pre-paid $128/night rate, which was excellent and suitable for our room at the Mosser. It is centrally located near the downtown shopping district and many other hotels. It has a beautiful art deco style lobby and a stylish decor throughout. Our room had a private bath, but there seemed to be ample shared bathrooms on every floor for those rooms that did not have a private bath. It is definitely a European-style hotel though - the average American traveller will find the rooms to be quite small. We are not large people, but we did have two large suitcases and the room felt very cramped - especially the tiny bathroom. But for one night, it was fine. There was normal city noise from outside. No air conditioning, but we had a fan which was adequate. The room was very clean. The front desk was very helpful, supplying us with a sewing kit when we needed one, and the porter was efficient. Organic apples were at the front desk, which was a nice touch. They also had basic pastries and coffee in the morning. Our one issue was with the parking service. Since we had rented a car for our entire trip, we had it with us in San Francisco, which was a bit of a problem as parking is scarce. The Mosser apparently has some kind of parking garage off-site which charges guests a daily rate of $28 if I recall correctly, with unlimited in-and-out valet services. Although we called down to request our car 20 minutes before we needed it on two occasions, it was not ready when we came to the lobby, and we had to wait 10-15 minutes for it to arrive each time with no explanation. On one occasion, when the car arrived, the stereo had been tuned to a different station with the volume cranked, and the gas was lower than how we had left it. This made us wonder. In general, leave the car at home when traveling to SF. Being from Boston and New York, we thought we had seen high parking prices - but the SF meters start at 5 cents per minute, and the garages are worse. All in all, the Mosser was an economical way to stay in SF and worth considering.

<Content>Good place if on a budget. This place has its good points and its bad.The good: Close to everything downtown. If not ,you can always fond public transportation within steps of this hotel. The underground MUNI system is right around the corner, so are the Cable cars on Powell St, and the Bart. Any of these will take you pretty much anywhere a tourist wants to go. Don't rent a car! Buy a MUNI pass good for 3-5 or 7 days, which is what I used and was well worth the 24 dollars for a 7 day pass.If you get a shared bath room, dfon't worry, they are always clean. I never had to wait to use one or the shower. Everytime I looked inside it was spotless. Also the smell of the hotel is very nice. I like the air freshener system they use in the place. Lots of places to eat all around and Walgreens and plenty of ATMS too.The bad: It can get somewhat noisy depending what side of the hotel you are on. I constantly heard beeping noises coming from an underground parking garage, and I was on the top floor! I also heard a whistle noise almost like a choo choo train, but its a type of whistle the doormen use to hail taxis! Its cute at first but after a while it can be annoying. Also in the morning housekeeping are noisy. They use storage bins in the wall which they open and close constantly to stock up supplies and they bang it open and closed all morning. I was in room 803, and 802 is literally right next to your door. Tucked in a corner. My neighbor had a bad habit of slamming their door when they left or came in. Very rude.But I would stay here again, but this time a bigger room and maybe in a quieter area. The price could not be beat.

<Content>good location, clean, tidy great location, rooms were not huge but worked for sleeping.We had one of the rooms on the 6th floor with private bathroom, shower etc in the suite.You could hear the street noise if you left the double window open. But once closed didn't hear anything, but did have to keep the fan on as the room got quite hot.Loved the free muffin and coffee in the morning, if we got up early enough to enjoy before heading out for the day.Staff were fair, stayed in many other hotels where the staff have been more helpfull and attentiive. But overall not complaints.Great location, close to everything with Taxi stand across the road if required.

<Content>A surprise This is the first time ever that I鈥檝e written a review of a hotel and here鈥檚 why: the Mosser exceeded my expectationsIt was great and I鈥檓 not often impressed with hotels. In fact I鈥檇 say the hotel is a well kept secret.I was unprepared for the compact, well-appointed rooms with a sense of place, the sleek Euro style that fit in with the historic building, and the location.The bar was intimate, comfortable, and the service welcoming.My room was clean, quiet and exceptionally reasonable. What a welcome break from the chain box hotels. I鈥檒l be back next time that I鈥檓 in San Francisco.

<Content>The Mosser is the most ! I was most impressed with The Mosser. First of all, the location is excellent, right in the heart of the city, convenient to bus, subway and cable car. The rooms are small but very clean. The shared bath was a good experience. Separate men's and women's toilets and a very clean bath/shower shared by three rooms; not a must but significantly less expensive. The staff are exceptionally helpful with directions, bookings, information, and even shipped boxes home for us. I can't say enough good things about The Mosser. Thanks

<Content>Oddball hotel The Mosser hotel is fantastically located on 4th St, right opposite the Marriott with its 45th floor bar and fabulous panoramic views, 1/2 a block away from the Metreon cinema complex (Imax please) and finally 5mn walk to the SF Moma Museum. Rooms are TINY! Don't get rm 207, 10'x8' (yes 10'x8') and is boiling hot and noisy (just abaove Annabelles restaurant! After 10mn I had a headache. there is NO AC in rms. The front desk was really nice in upgrading me right away to a larger rm WITH bathroom. Yes the cheaper rms have just a sink. Bathtub and toilets are down the corridor. the TV system isn't great. Some room have a 42 plasma, the cheaper rms have a 13 CRT. On mine, the picture was showing about 10mn after I turned it on. On the plasma tv, the picture is fuzzy (basic cable), and all extra services are expensive. There is the option of going on the web/tv but to check emails and such it's $13. Movies are expensive up to $16. there is free coffee tea and muffins, newspapers, magazines and tourists guides with good maps (public transport, Union Sq. hotels etc.) the staff is nice and courteous. there is a security guard patrolling at night. Walgreens is just around the corner. There is a big parking just around the corner but I don't know thee rates.

<Content>Small but Outstanding My wife and I spent two days in SF, and our stay at the Mosser was perfect in every way - the staff is helpful and friendly, rooms clean and smartly furnished, the quality of the towels and amenities is outstanding, and the location is ideal.Don't let the fact that breakfast is limited to muffins and coffee/tea put you off - the muffins are delicious, and the whole exercise takes much less time than a full breakfast and so gives you an earlier start!One potential area for improvement is the internet access through the room TV (for those like me too lazy to carry around their laptop), which is quite slow and can be very time consuming if you use Gmail.

<Content>Fairly priced We stayed in one of the rooms without bathroom. The room was very, very small, almost two small for two people (but perfect for one guest). The decor I found to be very nice for the price we paid and I must say I was impressed. The rate was something like 119 per night which is very reasonable for a hotel in this neighborhood. The location is great! The room was well equipped with even an iron and an ironing board and a wash basin. No view though. We were also close to the ice machine on the second floor of hotel and it was somewhat noisy. The shared bathroom was OK. I was initially a little grossed out just by showering in the same place that somebody else was, but it seemed nevertheless sufficiently clean. It was not clear to me how many rooms shared this bathroom and shower. We only stayed in the room for three nights. I would probably prefer my own bathroom in the futuree, but if you can bear showering where somebody else did and you want to save on accomodations so you can spend on other things, this is a top choice. Felt that staff were friendly and efficient.

<Content>Good Times at the Mosser I had a great time at the Mosser. Our room was towards the back of the building facing the Bloomingdales. If you kept the window open at night, it was SUPER loud and disruptive. But with the window closed it was perfect. Bathroom and shower were located down the hall and were always in great condition. Would stay again!

<Content>I want to go back to the Mosser I went to SF on business, after an intense week of traveling also for work reasons in the NorhtEast. I was pretty pooped. The front desk people at the Mosser were welcoming; the hotel is funky and different; the room was a corner room, there was a tray with a vase and a HUGE flower on my bed; bathrobes in the closet; EXCELLENT toiletries... I thought it was a true find. When I had trouble connecting with the Internet I got good advice on what to do and alternatives on where to go, no attitude, no sighs...The room was not also clean but efficiently and astutely furnished, small yes but everything I needed was there. People, this place deserves to be on your list.

<Content>Wonderful stay, great location! We had a great experience at the Mosser hotel. We stayed the last weekend of August 2008 for a quick mini weekend vacation on the cheap. So glad that we decided on the Mosser. Yes the rooms are small, big enough for the queen bed and small sink area with a little walking space... very european, but what are you doing in the room in an exciting city like SF? The hotel had everything that we needed. The shared restroom and showers were always clean, the staff was very welcoming and helpful during our stay and the location cannot be beat for the price. A few blocks to all the shopping you could ever want (Union Square), and right off of Market street and all the public transportation needed to get around the City.I will definitely stay at the Mosser every time i visit SF.

<Content>Stay at the Mosser! Not only is the Mosser a terrific value for the money, it's got a killer location. Rooms are small, but stylish. The staff is outstandingly friendly. I was pleasantly surprised to find a continental breakfast available in the morning, and there's great shopping around the corner. If you're headed to SF, particularly if you're spending your own money (and not on an expense account) you'll love the Mosser.

<Content>Boutique bargain Hard to believe some sites only rate the mosser 2+ stars.Its a great hotel in a great location. During my stay the staff were friendly and helpful when you needed them to be.The rooms are comparable with more expensive 'boutique' hotels i have stayed in, and are both clean and comfortable.There may be bigger and better hotels, but the Mosser provides great value for money and i would have no qualms about returning there next time i am in town

<Content>Over priced, rude, rooms are tiny and cheap looking We arrived and our room was $160 plus tax which we found to be ridiculously overpriced for the room we stayed in. It was not even a Queen bed, we were told it was a Double but that seemed to be a generous statement. The room was smaller than one at Fomule1 and there was stains on the carpet. I had forgotten my cell phone charger and went down stairs to see if front desk had one to fit my phone, I was then talked to like I was a thief and untrustworthy and was made to go back up stairs to bring my phone down so he knew I wasnt just going to take it which was very insulting. There was meant to be muffins for breakfast but there was none left at 8am. I was also charged $1 for each 1800(toll free) number that I had called which I have never seen before as it is a free call.Overall it felt as if we had been ripped off and we really didnt enjoy our stay at all and will not be returning in the future.

<Content>Good location, small room We stayed at The Mosser hotel for three nights, and chose it primarily for its central location and price. Despite the extremely small room, there was a CD player, TV, games console and wash basin, and our bathroom was situated across the corridor, so this wasn't a major problem. The hotel overall has a quirky but smart decor, with a nice foyer serving coffee and muffins at breakfast. The location was great as it was situated a few steps away from Union Square, Chinatown, the business district and the shops of Market St.

<Content>Clean, Convenient, Safe, Good Rates Okay - I liked this hotel because it's really convenient to the BART (1 block to Powell Station) and other public transportation (street cars, trolley cars, MUNI buses). It's also VERY clean and safe. I booked through Expedia and got a great rate, but I booked a European style room - no toilet or shower in my room, they were in the hall. And this worked out fine for me.Here's what you need to know before booking this hotel: The rooms are small but well-designed. They are nicely decorated in what I'd call a High IKEA style. The European style rooms have a sink, hair dryer, bath robe and iron + ironing board in them. The closets are small. The rooms have ceiling fans but no central air conditioning - usually not a problem in San Fran, but you do need to keep your window open to get some cool air. Since the hotel is so conveniently located, the downside is that it is also noisy - more so when you have your window open. Right now (early Sept. 2008), there is construction going on right in front of the hotel. With jackhammers. There is also a parking garage right next to the hotel, and every time a car exits the garage, there is a BEEP-BEEP-BEEP while the arm is up - and you CAN hear this if you're on that side of the hotel. There is also a restaurant on the first floor (not connected to the hotel, and I think it serves lunch/dinner only + it has a large bar) - one hotel guest told me that his first room was on the 2nd floor right above the restaurant and it was quite noisy. He got a room change. Some rooms are noisier than others, so request to move to a different room if yours is unbearable. The hotel serves coffee, decaf, hot tea and muffins in the lobby every morning from 7-10 AM. The front desk staff, while very polite, is mostly brand new and not very knowledgeable about restaurants, getting around town, etc. Except for one guy: John. He is great and he is usually there in the mornings.If you don't bring a laptop, you are kind of screwed as far as getting internet service: you CAN get internet on your in-room TV, but it costs $10/day. There aren't any terminals available for your hourly use, and it's kind of hard to find an internet cafe - but I did locate a grotty one on Post near Hyde St. But bringing your laptop is probably the cheapest option - there are tons of free wireless hot-spots all over town.As far as the European-style stuff: the restroom and shower are SPARKLING clean. All the time. There may occasionally be a brief wait to get into the shower, but nothing unbearable and certainly not a deal-breaker.Overall this is a well-run operation and very clean, convenient, safe and affordable. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Fine Location, Good Service Fine hotel in a downtown location. A mentioned by other reviewers, the rooms are on the small side but entirely adequate. Service was friendly and welcoming. I took a room with shared bathroom and toilet facilities and it was obvious that the house staff were checking and cleaning both the toilets and bathroom regularly. Reccomended.

<Content>Never going back again! I attended Oracle World 2007 and stayed at the Mosser. The only thing good about this hotel is it's location. If you are claustrophobicdon't even think about staying here. Small rooms, shared bath, broken elevator, TV on a stick coming out of your bed, broken AC and you can hear all the noise from the street. I'd rather stay at the Y. This year I am attending Oracle world 2008 and will be staying at the Palace which I highly recommend.

<Content>Perfect for a night away Nice modest hotel in a perfect location if you want to be down town. Market street has some not so nice areas but 4th Street where the Mosser is nice and safe. The hotel is easy walking distance to the Ferry Building and Plaza, a block from MUNI and BART and easy freeway access. This is a typical European old school hotel with very modern rooms. The place is well run, clean and comfortable. The in house bar and restaurant were both great. Both have very high ceilings, nice woodwork and a classic design.The rooms are small and may not be ideal for a family or if you are traveling with lot's of luggage. For a single person the rooms are fine. My room had triple layered window which kept all the potential street noise out, high quality bathrobes, fresh flowers, nice linens and pillows, and quality soap, shampoo etc...If I was spending several hundred dollars I would expect all of the above. My room was $119. For that price this is the greatest hotel deal in San Francisco hands down!!!I'm in SanFrancisco often. Now my only regret is I will not get to try any other hotels. I'm coming back :)

<Content>Affordable Getaway We stayed here for 6 days, 5 nights. It was affordable and clean. I wouldn't stay here if you are used to a luxury hotel, but it's a great location in downtown near shopping and you can ride the muni or bart to pretty much anywhere. We caught the bart from the airport to the hotel and it was only $5.35! We loved being so close to the Cheesecake Factory (yum)! It is much better than Fisherman's Wharf where all the tourists are and prices are higher. The rooms are pretty small, so if you are rooming with someone make sure you don't mind living in close quarters! We used the community bathrooms and they were always clean and never occupied. They also give you a shower caddy so you can carry your toiletries to the shower which is nice. You have a sink in the room, which is also nice. I enjoyed our stay here and I would recommend it highly for anyone wanting a reasonable stay while in San Francisco!

<Content>Nice stay at the Mosser My boyfriend and I stayed for two days at the Mosser from 8/23 - 8/24. We had room 608, which had a queen bed with bathroom and closet. The room was neat and clean with stylish, modern decor, but it was extremely tiny, although I expected that from reading other people's reviews. Just be prepared for a 2-3 foot perimeter around the bed, and that's it. Not much of a view, but you're in the city center, so that was also expected. It was reasonably quiet, in any case. Nice TV with cable, CD player, a chair or two, trashcan, and a nighttable was all that was in the room. There is no A/C, so we kept the windows open, which was fine. San Francisco usually has pretty temperate/cool weather.The bathroom was also tiny; standard tub, toilet crammed in right next to it, and sink across from that. Decent water pressure, plenty of hot water. I didn't much care for the sink though. It is about the size of a urinal, and there is a shelf right above it, so you can't splash your face with water without hitting your head on the shelf. Also hard to spit when brushing your teeth. Overall, it wasn't too bad though; just annoying.The lobby looked really nice, and the staff were friendly and pleasant. Breakfast was minimal - just coffee and muffins in a basket in the lobby, but the muffins were pretty good. We went around the corner to Mel's Diner on Mission St to supplement our breakfast - great food, cheap. Annabelle's Bistro was right next to the hotel, so we stopped in there for drinks in the evening, and it seemed like a good, local hangout. The location was good in the center of downtown. It was one block to Market Street with tons of shopping, restaurants, big office buildings, just a few blocks from San Francisco Bay. You can get to/from the SFO airport easily using the BART subway system, which has a stop just around the corner from the hotel on Market St; it was a $6 ticket/25 minute ride straight there. We used the MUNI system of trolleys to get around otherwise, which was also just around the corner and cheap at $1.50 anywhere you want to go on the line. The F line was our friend and goes all the way out to Fisherman's Wharf in about 15-20 minutes with stops at the piers along the way. We paid cash (exact change required) to the driver each time, but you can also get a MUNI card, which might be a little cheaper, depending on how many rides you take. As far as fun things to do, we had a car for two days ($35/day to park at the Mosser) and traveled to the Napa/Sonoma area one afternoon and hit a few of the wineries for tastings. It took about an hour to get there, and most of them close by 5 pm, so don't get up too late. Beautiful scenery, nice wines, tons of vineyards to try. The next day we drove to Muir Woods, which is an ancient sequoia forest with a walking trail. That was amazing; I felt like a dinosaur would come lumbering out from amongst the giant trees at any moment. We also hit the five-course Cirque du Soleil-style dinner show, Teatro Zinzanni at Pier 27/29; great food, great show - not cheap, but we thought it was worth it; book ahead. My favorite sidetrip was a bike ride across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito. We rented bikes from Blazing Saddles at Fisherman's Wharf for around $45 each, and it was a simply astounding ride past Ghirardelli Square to Fort Point, over the bridge, and down to the cute, little village of Sausalito, where we took the ferry back across (ferry ticket included in price). Took about 2-3 hours total.  Okay, back to the hotel. We also stayed four nights at the Queen Anne in Pacific Heights about 1.5 miles away, and both of us liked the Queen Anne better to be honest. The price was about the same (~$150/night), but the Queen Anne seemed more authentic to San Francisco, extremely cool, relaxed neighborhood (Fillmore district) with lots of neat boutiques and no chains, the rooms were 5x bigger, they had a better, more expansive breakfast, better bathrooms, and very reasonable access to transportation. However, if you really want to be in the bustling city center, convenient access to everything is the most important factor for you, and you don't mind being in a more corporate-y area, then the Mosser is the place for you, and is very reasonably priced for its location, especially if you get the rooms with the shared bathroom in the hall.

<Content>Great Location great location great location I usually seek out hotel that have a shared bath bc they are usually GREAT! And the Mosser was no exception. The rroms were small but had a great designed bathroom sink and an unusual amount of toiletries and amenitities! Tons a neat samples from Walmart!Americans seem to think that hotel rooms need to be the size of a football stadium but WHY??? One sleeps and rests and leaves or maybe watches a little tv but why the need for a stadium size rooom??As a frequent European traveleur I find cleanliness more important that size the the Mosser was indeed clean and fresh and non smoking!I hope that this place lives on and on with it very reasonable prices! Give me small cheap and chean anyday!! Au Revoir!

<Content>Very central This hotel is located very very central close to tram etc... looks nice reception is really chic... we had an ensuite double room... The sink was in the room rather than in the bathroom, the room was the smallest I have ever stayed at but very clean and had a fan so no problem. Views are of the next door house = none. Close to cinema and food court. Only downside is the room size which was TINY... telly fixed onto the bed on a little stand... We were also at the end of 6 weeks holiday and had lot of stuff so that did not help but it really was small.

<Content>Nice room, bad staff Myself and friends of mine booked twin rooms for the Mosser from 27th July X 4 nights. We in fact got double rooms but this was ok as it didn't bother us too much. The staff on check in were not friendly and welcoming as they could be and the concierge (door man) was pretty much useless with not even so much as a smile to make you feel welcome at all. We booked the rooms with shared bathrooms and even though the rooms were very small they were comfortable and clean and had a sink provided. The shared bathroom wasnt bad either and there was never any problem with a queue for the shower or toilets.Our friends had a problem with their door during the stay where the lock had died and after 5 or 6 trips to reception to get the problem rectified they had to move the room (they did not believe us and gave us new keys each time previous to this), My friends were left with everything in the room which couldn't be opened for the night and had no night clothes, no access to medication etc. This could have been a major inconvenience and the fact that the hotel were powerless to open the room until the following day should never be the case for health reasons if anything else. I would advise that the members of staff recognise that they are there to sell the hotel and welcome guests as I found their attitude towards us was cold and very unhelpful. I had to go to the concierge in the neighbouring hotel the Palomar on any questions I had who were wonderful and if I had not prepaid for the Mosser I would have liked to have stayed there instead.

<Content>Rooms Way Too Small The rooms at the Mosser (and we stayed in a room with its own private bathroom) are extraordinarily small. You literally bang into the phone on the wall every time your try to get into the closet.Also the sink which is not located in the bathroom is so badly designed that you risk knocking yourself out on the protruding glass shelf above everytime you wash your face.We also had a problem with a stuffed toilet -- which is pretty embarrassing to begin with -- it only got worse when we had to call the front desk twice to get someone to fix it.Also at check-in the staff is trying to be so cool that they come across as downright cold.If you are staying alone - the room could work -- with another person way too small.

<Content>Good accomodation for reasonable price The Mosser is well located near the Union Square and easy to get from the airport by using the BART train (Station Saint Powell).The advantages of the hotel are as follows:+ central location (near Union Square, Shopping Center and cable car station (Saint Powell, however there are always many tourists standing in a row))+ rooms and the public bathrooms on the floor are very clean+ there is nearly no noise+ TV in room + the rate was okay (very cheap for a hotel in the heart of San Francisco)There is one big disadvantage:- room is very small (not bigger than a shoe box) and there is nearly no space for your luggageThat's why the Mosser is interesting for people who prefer to discover San Francisco than to stay in the hotel.

<Content>Awesome budget hotel! Great location! The Mosser is a fantastic little hotel close to Union Square. For the price, I can't imagine finding anything better in such a great location. The rooms are small, well kept, and modern. Very simple, but stylish. The restrooms and showers are located in the hallway. It's a very peaceful and relaxing place to stay. Worth much more than you'll be paying!

<Content>Loved price  My husband  I spent 6 nights at The Mosser in San Francisco - it's a moderate hotel in Union Square area - very handy to get the tram or bus down to Fisherman's Wharf. We had a queen room (the bed was very good  comfy) - very small without a bathroom, (our choice as cheap) but there was a sink in the room. Bathroom  Toilet down the hall - both very clean  never had to wait to use them. They also have larger rooms with bathrooms for people who want to pay more.There was a breakfast in the reception area - delicious muffins  great coffee,  you could fill up a take-out container with a lid  take it with you too.It was cold while we were there, but the hotel was centrally heated  very comfortable.The staff were friendly  very helpful with tourist info, particularly John at reception - he was charming.I'd definately stay there again  recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced, clean, centrally located hotel in San Fran.who wants to fill their tummies before sightseeing!

<Content>The Mosser, a great place to stay downtown My daugher and I recently stayed one night at The Mosser in San Francisco in order to attend a baseball game and do some sightseeing in the downtown area. From the website it sounded like a great place, more boutique than typical chain hotel. After having some difficulty navigating the confusing one way/no left turn streets in the area, we managed to find 4th Street and quickly park with the valet service. Once inside, I was happy to see its small size and quiet lobby, staff were helpful. The room was on the small side, but had everything we needed and was clean, efficiently layed out and even hip. The bathroom was tight space wise, but manageable - a coffee maker would've been nice in the room, but there was nowhere it could go. We did have some questions about services (drink machines, check out time, etc.) that I had to ask the front desk about, but other than that our stay was very comfortable. I didn't hear any noise during the night either from the hallway or adjoining rooms, it was great not to have doors slamming, loud voices, etc., as in most hotels. I would definitely recommend this hotel, it is in a good location for shopping, entertainment and close to public transportation and gives a more European feel than a typical American hotel - more intimate and low key.

<Content>Great location, a fairly-priced gem in San Francisco We loved the Mosser. A perfect location near transit and attractions. This hotel is friendly, non-pretentious, and extremely well-maintained. We booked the suite with private baths, but were impressed with the appeal of the shared baths as well. We'll visit here again.

<Content>Great location, tiny room The Mosser is less than 30 mins from the San Francisco airport, and less than 30 secs from shopping and coffee on Market Street. Union Square, the major shopping area with loads of restaurants, is within 5 minutes' walk. In short, great location. You can get most of what you need as a traveler, be it shops, food, entertainment, and transportation. It's convenient location, however, also means it's on an extremely busy spot. The noise at night can be annoying, if you are a light sleeper or have jet lag like us. We could hear clearly people on the street, traffic and the occasional sirens. The room we had was more a shoe-box with a small double bed. We could barely move around our room with the 2 big suitcases we were travelling with for our 2-week vacation. The bathroom was literally the size to fit in the tub and the toilet. The sink was stuck in a corner in the room; and it's the smallest sink one can ever imagine. We chose The Mosser because it was right across our rental car pick-up point, and the price was right. It was only a quick 2-night stay before we moved on to drive around Northern California, so we were ok with it. I won't really recommend it if you are planning for a longer stay; unless if you plan to shop till you drop and party hard everyday. (You won't really notice the size of the room or the noise if you are dead tired...)

<Content>I liked the Mosser The Mosser is a very clean, comfortable, friendly, attractive hotel that's in a great location in San Francisco. It's also inexpensive. The only drawbacks - which are no secret - are that the rooms are small (although very well arranged) and the bathrooms are shared (or at least mine was). If you're OK with that, definitely stay at the Mosser.

<Content>Glad I found The Mosser! I stayed at The Mosser for four nights in June 2008. It's been my home away from home as a single traveler in San Francisco since I found it about five years ago. The location is ideal, just off Market Street a few blocks from Union Square -- BART, buses, trolleys and cable cars all nearby. The hotel is in an old building with high ceilings, is very clean and well-maintained, and is simply but pleasantly furnished yet has everything I need. The staff without exception have been pleasant and professional, helpful, and just plain nice. I choose to stay in the shared bath rooms, and that has been no problem. The rooms are not large. The shared bath single might feel a bit cramped if you plan to spend much time in the hotel -- in that case, go for the shared queen -- but I'm in town to experience the city, not the hotel, and just need a clean, quiet place to sleep and shower. I'm not a fan of big American motel chain rooms. The Mosser is much more comfortable and pleasant! This is a hotel that puts the emphasis on the things that matter. I'm glad I found it.

<Content>It was awsome I stayed at the Mosser during July 4th weekend it was nice.lets start: the price was not bad at all. We got a nice clean room with are own bathroom which was really nice since they do have the share bathroom/like hostel too. Any how the place was super clean every where. the place looks kind of not expected too much from the outside. However when you open the door to this palce you are blown away. the people are nice and it is kind of real homey. I arrived early at 11am before checkin which is at 3pm. They had a room avaliable and the let me go ahead and check in, which was fantastic. I was so totally not thinking i would beable to heck in until 3pm. I was very happy. the room was small. we took the stairs alot because the elevator was slow,but it does work.In the morning thay have complimentary muffins andcoffee/tea which is really nice. In the night it was pretty quite when we put the window down. we had a nice breeze for the most part and if we needed more air we just put on the fan.This hotel is really convienent we were close to everything. We werer in walking distance to sf moma. The F cable car that took us too fishermans wharf . It was really easy to catch with all the information we received from Tameka. We were also right next to the MUNI transportation. There was the mall down the street which was awsome to go to. John was very helpful too with directions. On the latest updates Tim gave us a lot of information. The peole were really nice, they made you feel like you were on vacation and always very helpfull with all my odd questions. Fast and easy check out.This Hotel made my trip to San Fran a really great one. I would reccomend this hotel to everyone.

<Content>Great place to stay I stayed at The Mosser on 3 separate ocassions for 2-4 nights in May/June 2008. It has an excellent location - on Fourth Street, within a block of Mason/Powell cable car and the Powell Street BART stop (great for getting to and from the SFO airport); just round the corner from the F-line (which goes down to the Embarcadero and Fishermans Wharf), and within a block of SF Museum of Modern Art. On two of the visits I varied my length stay at short notice and was able to get the same room for extra days. I loved the decor of the rooms - clean and modern style - none of the fussy, floral / cottagey stuff! There was also great service at the front desk. A bonus was being able to book a reliable shuttle to the airport directly with the hotel - this is much better than having to deal with SuperShuttle, who require 24hrs notice and for the customer to book via a 1-800 number, and they sometimes do not arrive on time...I would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Beautiful Hotel I loved staying in this hotel. Not only was it a great deal for being smack-dab in the middle of downtown, the rooms were clean, the staff friendly and extremely helpful. My boyfriend and I had one of the shared-bath rooms. It was small, but the bed was extremely comfortable and the room clean. Lots of nice little amenities were provided, like (nice) razors and a bathrobe. There was a sink in the room, which was really convenient. The TV was pretty tiny, but there was so much to do that we only spent an hour our last night watching it. I never had to wait for the lavatory or the showers. The front desk attendant who checked us in was continuously helpful; we asked a few times for restaurant recommendations and were quite pleased each time. I have stayed in similar historic budget hotels that weren't half as nice as The Mosser. If I go to San Francisco again, that is definitely where I will stay.

<Content>loved it! I can't say enough good things about the Mosser. I'd be very, very surprised if there was anywhere else in SF that offered such good value for money, such an amazing location and such consistently good customer service. Like others have pointed out, the rooms are small but they're spotless and very well designed. The location is superb - very safe compared to just a few blocks further down the road (I had friends staying on 7th St off Market and the difference was marked) and also within walking distance of just about everything you'll need. The service was exceptional (I also stayed at the Whitcomb - avoid! - and the Hilton - so, so) and the little touches, like the free muffins and coffee for breakfast, very welcome. I can't fault it and I'll definitely be staying there the next time I'm in SF. It's a no-brainer, people - book it!

<Content>Wish I was back in San Fran I booked one night at The Mosser for my husband's 27th birthday. When we checked in, the staff was super nice and continued to be so throughout our stay. We stayed in a deluxe queen room on the 7th floor-- and we loved it! I would def stay in the Mosser again! The bed was comfy. I really loved how the decor was modern. After staying in Motel 6s and in Paris for our honeymoon, I was prepared for the small rooms -- and I didn't think it was too small at all. Who wants to pay more $$ for wasted room space? The only thing I regret is that I didn't wake up early enough to sample the free muffins in the lobby (available 7 -10 a.m).

<Content>straighforward and comfortable I booked online at the hotel website. I arrived very early for check in and my room was free so they let me in! The location is central and safe. There are good food and drink options nearby. They do free coffee and muffins in the foyer in the morning. I ate in the bistro next door which was quite nice. The rooms are tiny. The TV is tiny. I used the shared bathroom option was is fine. Air flow and temperature in the room was hot/cold but I find this a problem wherever I stay anyway. I'd recommend this hotel and would stay there again!

<Content>Good Hotel for the Budget Traveler I stayed here about two weeks ago, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was friendly and helpful. My room was clean and comfortable. The shared showers and toilets were very clean as well. The hotel is also in a very good location that is close to tourist attractions and public transportation. My trips to and from the airport were only 30 minutes long via BART. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family.

<Content>Mosser Excellent Value! Stayed recenty to attend a Giant's game. Didn't want to spend alot of dough and chose the Mosser. I'm originally from the City and have known of the Mosser (especially the dive hotel it was back in the 1980's). What a transformation! It's a beautifully designed, well appointed and friendly staffed hotel. The employees are very helpful and knowledgeble (overheard a desk clerk explaining our California Mission system to a foreigner), though not overly solicitous (with hand out). The location is perfect. Bus to the ballpark is right in front. Excellent restaurants within walking distance; the Metreon for movies. The MOMA around the corner and of course, Dave's Bar on 3rd...best beer deals in town; always has the game on and a great Juke box! Rooms are small, but perfect for what a busy or active traveler needs. Our room had a small chair that had a swing table on the arm and a foot rest that slid out, perfect for working on the laptop. Flat screen TV, dvd and stereo. The famous one on Nob Hill doesn't even offer that! We definately will return; we get up to the city often and have found a new pad in the Mosser. I'll recommend it to everyone heading to the City. The better hotels should take notice! Mosser, Great job!!

<Content>Love the Mosser! My husband and I have stayed here numerous times on business trips. It is a great location, very accessible to all areas of the city and activities, impeccably furnished, and makes great use of its smaller sized rooms in a beautiful old Victorian building. The bar restaurant and staff are just as fantastic. Finally, it's priced very reasonably, costing much less than chain hotels with far less attractive rooms and atmospheres. And, in the meantime, you're in a bustling area of downtown with lots of nice local bars, restaurants, and stores nearby- instead of stranded out on Fisherman's Wharf with all the tourists and overpriced mediocre food. A great little boutique-style place.

<Content>As a single parent would definately stay there again!!! My son (7yrs) and I went on our first trip to the San Fran and stayed at the Mosser. I was amazed at how comfortable and clean it was considering the price. We had one room with a double bed which although compact provided all we needed. Using the shared bathroom and toilets was never a problem and they were always clean. Staff were great and informative. Very close to get the tram to the wharf. Also spent every morning just around the corner at Mel's dinner for breakfast which was yum. Was not disturbed by noise inside or outside the hotel. Would recommend to anyone on a budget who is just looking for clean, good priced accommodation in san fran. Good place for single/couple travellers or other fellow single parents!! Would stay there again :)

<Content>You'll feel at home at the Mosser I don't know why I have not stayed at this hotel before. From the moment that I arrived at the front door of this hotel, conveniently located on 4th Street in San Francisco, I was met with great customer service and a welcoming attitude. Michael, the valet, was very helpful in arranging parking accomodations for my car and handling the luggage. I noticed that he took extra time to advise other guests about directions to specific locations that they wanted to visit. The front counter personnel were also very helpful with visitors out of town that were looking for sites to see and the best way to get around.This is an older hotel that has been updated where updating was necessary but has kept it's charm and architecture from years past. The appointments in the room are very modern with flat screen LCD television, nice lighting fixtures, fan, double pane windows that actually open, and a great use of limited space.The hotel has complimentary coffee, tea and muffins in the hotel lobby every morning, which is a very nice way to start your day. The hotel is right next to a great newer shopping center (Westfield) and many other shopping attractions and restaurants.Overall, this hotel is a great value and I will definately stay there again. I recommend it highly to anyone looking for a convenient and cost-saving place to stay when visiting San Francisco.

<Content>Great little place - awesome location My husband and I stayed for one night at The Mosser recently. It's a boutique style hotel in a renovated old building located at Market and 4th in San Fransisco.When we arrived (early) our room was not quite ready so we were upgraded to a queen bed, which was awesome. All the staff were really nice and friendly, check in/out was very efficient.The rooms are definitely small but are really well designed and if you don't need a lot of space the place is ideal because it is super clean, the bed is comfy and room rates are really good. Windows are double so the city noise is not too bad.This hotel was recommended to us by a friend and and will stay again next time we are in the city.

<Content>just right hotel with good design sense The Mosser offers great value with well designed rooms that have been updated recently. The lobby is also pleasant and staff are helpful. Rooms are small (think Paramount in NY), but the decor is clean and modern so it works.location is south of market - good for downtown business and right at a Bart station.

<Content>Very nice. Loved it. My husband and I celebrated our anniversary and decided to try the Mosser. To our delight it was very nice and clean. The rooms were small but I didn't expect they would be huge. Regardless, we were very comfy and relaxed. The staff seemed reserved, professional, and friendly. They seemed to enjoy their job enough to make you feel comfortable. If you want fancy dancy and snobby go somewhere else. We found the Mosser wonderful and extremely relaxing even with the window open and the noise below.We took Caltrain from Sunnyvale and walked to the hotel, only 12 minutes. It took less then 5 minutes to the cable cars. We had diner very late at one of the jazz clubs nereby and enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere very much and the fact that are hotel was a few minutes away was great. My husband and I want to come back for our next anniversary and stay longer. We loved it.

<Content>great value but noisy halls The location is the absolute best part of staying there. You don't have to manuever through throngs of crowds to leave or return to the hotel like you do with some of the more higher end hotels in union square. It is very close to public transportation and in walking distance to a lot of great places such as the Metreon, California Center and union Square. The staff was very professional, accomodating and knowledgeable about SF. I stayed in a room w/ a queen size bed and private bath, which was comparable in size with similar rooms in the city. My room faced the front but the street noise was hardly noticable. The only reason I give it a neutral rating is because the hall noise was distracting. Noise traveled across the hall from the opposite hotel room. It was very much like staying in a dorm. I stayed on a holiday weekend so that may have contributed to the noise factor, The staff sent security once which made a big difference but other guests in other rooms seemd to have started making noise once the others were told to be quiet. This is not a place for light sleepers . If you are a heavy sleeper or are willing to trade off quietness for good value then this is the place to stay. I'm sure earplugs or headphones would help to.

<Content>What a great find! My husband and I stayed at The Mosser after reviewing hotels through hotels.com. We found this place to be a gem. The staff was always warm and welcoming. Our room was clean and cozy. We must also rave about their restaurant and bar, Annabell's. Wine selection was fantastic and the food was exceptional. Even had a chance to meet the chef. Price was great and we were right in the heart of the city! We look forward to another stay next time we travel to San Francisco. J  S Suckling

<Content>Perfect location Awesome hotel for the budget traveler. My friend and I chose a room with s bathroom--I would not travel any other way. We got a room with a double bed and it was very, very small. However, it was such a cute place and the location was perfect that it made up for it. For the traveler that just wants a place to throw your bags down and spends most of their time out anyway--this is the place to go!! p.s. Our first night was on the second floor by a bar that was very noisy at night. We changed rooms to the top floor and slept fine the second night.

Had a shared bathroom, but it was close to my room and I never had to wait to use it. Location is great 鈥?steps away from Market St and the BART station and a couple of blocks from Union Square. They do offer mediocre coffee and muffins in the morning, but it鈥檚 nothing to get excited about. Generally happy with my stay but not blown away.

<Content>nice little room I stayed there 2 nights with my girlfriend visiting San Francisco. The hotel's location is great, just some steps from Union Square, BART Station, Market Street.The building is very nice and the lobby is beautiful. A new elevator has just been installed.I had booked a deluxe double room, which was VERY small, even for European standards -- I think the deluxe definition comes from the HUGE tv screen, which we did not use since we were there for visiting the city! The room had a nice design bed and a flower was put on the bed every day. It was generally clean but I would not walk barefoot on the floor.Muffins and coffee in the lobby for breakfast, free biologic apples in the afternoon. Young people in the staff are very friendly and helpful.All in all, a pleasant stay at a moderate price.

<Content>Very impressed with The Mosser We spent five nights at The Mosser in San Francisco, this March, and it was one of the most pleasant hotel experiences that I've had. The Mosser is a beautifully presented hotel, within walking distance of almost everything you'd want to see in San Francisco. The rooms are small but well equipped and excellently maintained. The staff are friendly and helpful, no matter what time of day or night. A light breakfast of coffee and muffins is set out in the main lobby each day, and there's always a bowl of fruit to help yourself to on the front desk (a nice change, when you've spent a week indulging in Disneyland snacks in Anaheim!). Although the hotel is close to many, varied, restaurants, including China town, the hotel restaurant itself (Anabelle's) had fantastic food...and coming from Melbourne, I'm pretty biased! On the whole, a great place to stay to explore San Francisco and to get well looked after by people that know the city well.

<Content>Great Hotel for the price After reading the reviews before going on my trip, I was a bit wary, but my opinion changed once I got onto the property. The lobby is beautifully (perhaps my taste) decorated in Victorian style. The room was small, but adequate. Coming from Manhattan, I thought the space was good. My friend and I booked a deluxe room with 2 twin beds, which means that we had our own bathroom. We both weren't feeling well when we arrived. (Thanks, AA :S) We rested for a while before we walked to fisherman's wharf. We're New Yorkers - we walked! All the tours were done by that time, but we did by a bottle of wine on our way back. We mixed our wine with juice and cut up our fruit (we packed fruits due to no food on our flight) and soaked it to make sangria while we went out for a burrito. Our sangria was perfect when we returned. Perfect for putting us to bed. We had muffins (complimentary) and coffee the next morning and checked out. We checked our luggage in storage and explored San Francisco until we traveled to our next destination. We left the luggage at the hotel for 12 hours, and had no problems retrieving them. Our room cost 119.00 plus tax and my friend and I divided it by 2 so it came out to about the same as a shared room. We had a pleasant stay, slept with the window's open and had no problems whatsoever. We didn't take any pictures of the room, sorry! Drunk people should not operate cameras. . .

<Content>Convenience  I attended a medical conference right across the street at the Marriott, I was closer to the conference rooms than the attendees who were on the upper floors of the Marriott. The Mosser was recently remodeled, they kept the best of the old,  added all sorts of new things compacted into the rooms in a way that they didn't seem to subtract from the limited space. I noticed  loved all of the little details that they added, since I had stayed there years ago by myself when I was at another conference. There was a full bath  plenty of hot water. We had a sense of privacy, it was quiet in spite of being right downtown. My husband is disabled, but we were so close we were able to walk just a few blocks to the Embarcadero, farmer's market, Union square, cable cars, Moscone center, Museum of Modern Art and a multi movie complex, not even 1/2 block away! We found handicap parking right on the street, but they offered 24 hour valet service for a reasonable price. The staff could not have been more helpful, they were friendly  inviting. And on top of everything it was spotlessly clean, I wasn't afraid to sit on the bedcover or walk on the carpet without my shoes. We will stay there again.

<Content>Great location, nice trendy decor, small rooms Stayed six days on a business trip. Small rooms, but very nice fittings. Stayed in corner room and had nice side view on the street. The Mosser is right downtown, very good location and walking distance to all sightseeing, convention center, restaurants and shopping.Value for money and would definitely stay again.

<Content>Great hotel, great location My boyfriend and I stayed at the Mosser hotel for 2 nights. We booked the room with a shared bathroom and were slightly worried about it until we saw it. The bathroom was beautiful and absolutely spotless. The room was very clean and comfortable and had a sink in it which was very convenient. The hotel is close (walking distance) to the Cable car station and it's location is convenient if you plan on visiting the major SF attractions. They serve coffee, tea and delicious muffins in the lobby for breakfast! The parking was vallet for about $33 a day and our car was always ready within about 20 minutes after we requested it. Great hotel, nice people!!!

<Content>Exclusive hotel feeling with shoestring budget prices The hotel was listed as a semi-hostal which scared me because I have never stayed in a hostal. As it turned out, the hotel was beautiful and the staff gave 5-star service. The entire hotel was immaculate.to include the community hall bathroom stall and community single room/stall shower And, I was able to stay in the heart of San Francisco, Union Square, for less than $70 a night! The room was small, but plenty big enough for one person, two if you were a couple. For those who have traveled to Europe....the room was the same size you would get in one of the more premier hotels. The bathroom was all granite tile and so was the shower room. I will definitely go back and I would definitely recommend it to any of the solo travelers!

<Content>Disappointing The hotel is clean enough but the rooms are absolutely tiny. You can barely move in it. The TV is fixed onto the bed and as such I kept kicking it at night. Too expensive for what it's worth. Location is not that bad but there are loads of bums going around. No AC, just a noisy fan. The offer of a bag with a condom and sex lube was a bit awkward.

<Content>What a great location at a reasonable price. The Mosser was a great pick for 2 without children. Right in the middle of downtown San Francisco. The two of us were in a double bed/shared bathroom, and it was perfect. We went to San-Fran to do a little sight seeing and experience the life of the city. If that is what your doing and don't plan to stay in the room a whole day, this place is for you. The bathrooms were kept very clean, cleaned twice a day. Check in went smooth and quick as did the check out. They were helpful getting shuttle service to the airport.There is nothing I can complain about this hotel. It is in a great location and the price was unbeatable for being right where you want to be when on vacation. near shopping, great restaurants. Not even a 1/2 block away from the BART system and bus stops.

<Content>Look beyond the surface The Mosser is in a central location to the main shopping district and has a gorgeous lobby, but once you get past those things it has a lot of problems. I had a room with a private bath (the others share small bathrooms on each floor) but the room was tiny. I barely had enough room for my suitcase to lie down. But I was not there to spend time in the room so you could cope with that if that was the only problem. The staff are rude ad arrogant and when asking reasonably simple things you get quite an attitude. During my stay my electronic key deactiviated. After trying it several times i returned to the front desk to request assistance and the front desk clerk just gave me a look and said well did you try it slowly? which I did not feel was an appropriate response. Also, this place is noisy. My room overlooked an alley where I am pretty sure everyone in San Fran parked their motorcycles so all night you were irritated by the noise of motorcycles coming and going. Also, the staff seem to run the place. Everytime I tried to catch the lift it was held on floors or full of cleaning/maintenance staff who just kind of look at you when you want to use the lift. They need to pull their staff in line. But overall, not terrible for the price if you are on a budget. Just pack earplugs.

<Content>Small and quirky, but a great bargain Overall, the Mosser is a good little hotel, in an outstanding location. Anything else in the Union Square area is far, far more expensive. Just remember that you do get what you pay for. The room I was in was absolutely tiny. I knew it was going to be small, but I was rather unprepared for the size. The photo which shows the platform bed is basically a photo of the entire room. A little bit of floor space, a small closet, and a sink is about all you get. Interestingly enough, the tv is mounted on the wall above the sink, though it makes watching tv in bed easy and comfortable. However, the hotel offers savings on bookings of a week or longer and I ended up paying only $50 a night for the room. Moreover, everything was very clean, tidy and comfortable. It was well worth the money, particularly in terms of location. It is just feet from the Market Street streetcar line, a minute's walk to the all-important cable car terminus, and a very brief stroll to Union Square, major shops, and SFMoMA. This is a good deal for a room and the location is wonderful.

<Content>Mosser is delightful! Quaint, turn of Century decor; spotless; quiet; right in the middle of the action--shopping, restaurants, BART/Muni access. Super nice personnel. Great morning coffee spread. Only negative is no lobby (free) computers--internet access $10 in room. Traveled 60+ countries...one of the nicest i have stayed in. Don't be put off by shared bath rooms (a bath tub to die for!).

<Content>Great hotel in San Francisco I stayed at the MOSSER in March for 5 days. I absolutely loved it. It is perfectly located in the middle of everything about a block from Union square. On one corner, you have Yerba Gardens. On the other, you are on Market Street and you have access to public transportation. You are about 1 5 minute walk to Chinatown. The hotel itself is great. The rooms are small but really clean and really boutiquey. I like the charm of the hotel. All the staff is wonderful. You might feel a little crammed in te room, but it gives you the feel of the city. I need to go back in December and I am definitely staying at this place. Also, I was lucky to find a deal for under 100 by booking through otel.com.

<Content>PLEASANT EXPERIENCE I have just returned from a one-night stay at The Mosser, San Francisco. The hotel is extremely centrally located in the heart of the shopping malls of San Francisco. Journey to big dperatments are just steps away. The service provided by the hotel staff is delightful and professional. I can never dream of having such experience from a non-5 star hotel. The hotel provided all relevant materials for a tourist: brouchures, magazines, newspapers and even complimentary breakfast. It even has a CD-radio player in the room. The room is well maintained, should be attributed to the hardworking housekeeper. I strongly recommend his hotel to any one, on business or leisure alike.

<Content>Great location is all it has We booked this hotel for 4 nights mainly due to the location. The reception staff were anything but friendly. This was the first part of a 2 month trip around America and I always thought Americans were meant to be helpful with the 'Have a nice day' attitude, but clearly it by passed the staff in this hotel.The room was quite small and clean, but not up to the standards I would have expected. The main thing this hotel had going for it was location and we spent most of out time out so only slept in the room anyway. We were close to Nob Hill, Union Square etc.

<Content>Decent place...But not worth the money I stayed at The Mosser on a Saturday night due to a friend was getting married at St. Patrick's Church nearby. It's a boutique hotel in the SOMA neighborhood (not far from Union Square) that occupies an old Victorian. The hotel is very attractive from the outside and the lobby. The neighborhood is definitely the plus to this hotel. You're paying for the privilege of staying in the area and not much more. In my research, I found The Mosser was one of the most reasonably priced hotel in the area, but it's still very expensive. The rooms are frighteningly small (and we have stayed at some European hotels with pretty small rooms), my husband and I were literally tripping over each other while we were getting ready. They try to make the most of the very small space by having a flat screen TV, no dresser, small end tables, no counter in the bathroom, etc... But there's only so much you can do when the room is very, very small to start with. The front desk people were very friendly, and we did appreciate that they let us check in early. The hotel's decor was modern and trendy, but carpets and bedding are showing some signs of wear and tear. It really comes down to value for me, and I think that it's just not worth it to pay the money to stay in this area. We stayed at a place in Cow Hollow/Marina District the night before, and the room was literally twice the size and half the price of our room at the Mosser. I would suggest if possible, stay somewhere else and cab it back and forth to SOMA or Union Square if you need to be there, you'll still have money left over at the end of the day.

<Content>A Gem and a Bargain! We stayed at The Mosser for 7 nights while husband attended conference.We had a queen deluxe room with a private bath. The per night had been $150 but when we extended stay from original 5 nights to 7 nights, the rate went down to $75 a night. I knew from reading reviews on here that the rooms were small and pretty basic, so we weren't expecting much more. We also knew that they had only coffee and muffins for breakfast and that Internet was $10 a day. Doing your homework keeps you from being surprised, I guess.But we were surprised - pleasantly so. Our room [#621] faced 4th Street, but with the double double windows, the room was not really noisy. You could hear street sounds, but at night, it was quiet enough so that sleep wasn't disturbed.The room had a bay window, but no window seat. We kept our suitcases in that area and they were out of the way. We had a flat screen tv which worked well.The room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable. The sink drain was a bit slow, but we managed. There were just 2 sets of towels, but that was ok too.The mattress was not a heavenly one, but we were comfortable. It was a mattress on a wooden platform, so it may not be what you are used to, but we slept okay on it. I asked for extra bedpillows and got them right away.The hairdryer didn't seem to be working on the first morning, and I told the front desk about it. They had someone come up to check on it within about 30 minutes. It was the working when he check it - apparently the GFI thingy had to be reset [I thought I had tried that].Staff was pleasant and we thought that we had gotten the deal of the century.We would happily stay again at The Mosser and we would recommend it without hesitation!

<Content>Do Not Stay Here the hotel is old and room are extremely basic! we did not even have a tv which caused problems later. The bathroom sink being in the bedroom was somewhat unusual. However, the view of the brick wall across from us was fantastic. When we checked out we left the hotel only to be called a few minutes later. They informed us that the TV was missing from the room. The cleaning lady had apparently seen it there the day before. Strange since neither of us had noticed it. We returned to the hotle where we had left our bags in the storage room. The deputy manager accused us of stealing the television. He was extremely rude. He kept us waiting for half an hour. Making us very late to the airport. He even threatened to call the police. I told him that this would be fine and would happily talk with them. In the end they gave us back our bags and didn't even apologize to us. If you are looking for some drama on your vacation then please stay here. Otherwise, find another hotel

<Content>Better elsewhere This hotel has excellent location - next to the convention center. But if you a tourist, you can select a different hotel at a better price!The hotel has tiny rooms, noisy hallway (wooden floor), and very expensive ($200+ for one night) for its size. Several rooms have a hollow vent pipe running outside the windows - making the low frequency noise all night. The internet is $10 per day. The free breakfast is muffin only, every single day.

<Content>TINY rooms! Being from Montana, I guess I'm used to more wide-open spaces! My husband and I stayed here for a conference he attended and we were pretty cramped. Not much room to move around once the luggage is on the floor - nowhere else to put it! The tiny corner sink was impossible to wash my face in. Great coffee and muffins in the morning, great location as it was close to shopping, eating, a neat little park and a great aquarium.

<Content>Wonderful! I chose this hotel because of the location but will always stay here when I'm in SF. I found my room comfortable, well equiped and as quiet as you could hope for in the center of a big city. Steps from buses, cable cars and the BART, it really is the best starting point to explore this city. I appreciated the ceiling fan, sound-tight windows and fresh apples every morning. Great experience.

<Content>I left my heart at The Mosser! I booked this hotel after looking online. I didn't have a clear idea of which neighbourhood I wanted to stay in. For going in blind I couldn't have been any luckier than finding this great hotel! It ended up being the perfect location for me, close to all transportation, and withing walking distance of so much. I always felt safe, no matter what time of day I came or went. I LOVED the room, and the staff were beyond helpful. There was a great restaurant next door, and when I come back to San Francisco, I won't even look for a different hotel. I'm staying here again!

<Content>Good, but a few issues... We met up with a friend in San Francisco and he booked this hotel for us so the first I knew of it was when we arrived (after spending 2 weeks driving from New York). The hotel is in the business district but is good looking with a nice lobby. The area has a few bars and restaurants but it's also well located for public transport to all the other areas so it's a decent location. The inside of the hotel is clean and well decorated, the rooms are spotlessly clean but are tiny - most have the sink in the bedroom as the en-suite shower room is a (well) converted cupboard. The beds are also small by American standards but are comfortable. Unfortunately we did encountera few problems whilst staying here - firstly, when we arrived we were given our electronic room key (swipe card style) however when we got to our room it didn't work. My husband went back to the lobby and returned with a member of staff who also tried the key before agreeing that, we were right, it didn't work. My friend sympathised as he had experienced the same problem when he had checked in the day before. The staff were helpful though and immediately moved us to a different (slightly bigger) room, where the key worked perfectly, until we returned from a night out! We tried to get into our new room and had the same problem as earlier. My husband and I returned to the lobby and explained our problem to the receptionist who had some issues understanding us. For some reason she insisted on checking her computer and then announced that there was no one staying at the Mosser that night with out surname! This was quite a surprise as, we explained, all our belongings were currently locked in a room several floors above our heads! After repeating ourselves several times (each time met with a polite if slightly irritating smile!) before my husband had to go out for some air. I decided to write our surname down for the receptionist in case she had been spelling it wrong (mishearing our M's for N's perhaps?) and finally had some success - she found our details and called for a security guard with a master key who escorted us back to our room and let us in. All in all, this place is nice, clean and well situated but make sure you prepare yourself for malfunctioning room keys and slightly confused (but always polite!) reception staff!

<Content>Cozy, Convenient, Cheap For the price and value I would have to say this was a great place to stay. Although the room and bathroom were very small, they were well furnished and all the essentials were looked after. Everything was clean and the building was always quiet. The view wasn't that great (overlooking the side of a crate and barrel store) but when staying in San Francisco it is to be expected. A great place to stay if you're just looking for a quiet room to sleep in at night and then get out and visit the city during the day. It is only a few blocks away from many shopping stores so is very convenient for visitors.

<Content>Great cosy rooms at the Mosser My family came to visit me in San Francisco, and I booked rooms at The Mosser Hotel for them. They thoroughly enjoyed their stay. The rooms were well-kept, well-cleaned and very cosy. My mom and aunt stayed in a suite with private bathroom, while my brother had a room with shared bathroom. He thought it was the coolest thing ever. He got his own room, with a little wash area, television, and even a Nintendo game system to play with. The Mosser is centrally located near Union Square, and it was so easy for my family to take a few steps out of the hotel and find shopping, restaurants, even movie theaters. I'd like to thank the staff at The Mosser for welcoming my family to San Francisco and taking care of their needs during their stay. A greatly recommended choice for anybody who's visiting San Francisco.

<Content>Don't book the Holiday Tunes Package! This hotel is in a great location and the building and rooms are older, but charming. The rooms are small but have all modern furnitureand equipment. For $100 a night in the heart of San Francisco, a good value. My husband has been wanting to try the Holiday Tunes pacakge for 2 years! He finally booked it and was so excited for his studio appointment When we checked into the hotel we were told that our timewas now 1p.m. instead of noon. We had set it up for noon so that we could check out and then go to the appt. The desk clerk said no problem and gave us a later check out at 2 p.m. Very nice guy, we wereall happy. When we got to the studio for our appt. the technician was very rude and unhelpful. Basically said, so what do you want to do, what do you want me to do? We said that we had purchased the Holiday tunes pacakge and were here to do some Christmas songs?! He basically looked at us like we should be telling him what to do and didn't help at all. He said that there wasn't anything he could do for us if we hadn't brought our own music, we were never told to bring music with us when we called and booked the package. We assumed that there would be someone there to help and guide us, that wansn't the case. The entire situation was very uncomfortable, and akward. He definitely didn't want us there. We told him nevermind, we'd just get our money back and he said okay, that sounds good. When we went back to the hotel to check out and ask for the Studio part of our stay to be refunded, there was no manager on duty. We waited for over half an hour while the desk clerk called the manager back and forth several times. It took forever to get the room rate without the studio fee added on. When they did finally get it done, they still charged us more then the price should have been, but at that point we were so irritated that we didn't care. We then waited 40 minutes for the valetto bring our car up so that we could leave. It takes forever to get your car, make sure to give them at least 30 minutes notice. There is only one elevator for the whole hotel, so the staff are using it to haul dirty laundry and carts, it takes forever for the elevator to getto your floor. We were on the 6th floor and it was much faster to walkdown then to wait for the elevator. We definitely won't be staying here again, not because the hotel is bad, but because we wern't happy with the way our issue was handled. We stay in San Fransisco often and this hotel had definitely lost our business. When the manager getson and replies to this review, I would just like to say that not only were we unable to talk to a manager while we were there, the manager did a very poor job handling what was basically a customer service issue over the phone. So to breakdown the whole experience: Small rooms, good location, horrible elevator, horrible valet parking, charming atmosphere, really horrible recording studio, decent value.

<Content>My favorite, and only, place worth staying in the city I made my reservation right on their website both times I've stayed there - this past Thanksgiving weekend and also a few days in April. Here is the review I sent to their manager in response to his personal followup on my (and probably all guests') stay (which I think is nice of them to do):Your hotel is awesome and I will be loyal as I have. I tell others about your great hotel too. The service couldn't have been better - very helpful, professional and attentive and not snooty at all. So clean too, so well designed, the room's are well thought out and have nice lighting, general attention to detail, the mix of old-San Francisco with wood inlays is mixed well with the choices for furniture, colors and textiles. Just want to say that I love your hotel. I would recommend booking an 'inside' room with your reservation - we had a car alarm outside our window that went off every time the BART passed. Given that inconvenience I still had a blast in this hotel.

<Content>This was a great place This was a great place to stay in SF. It is in a really great location and the room was neat and tidy with new sheets and towels. The little TV at the foot of the bed needs replacing with a flat sceen on the wall but overall it was a great funcky place to stay for a reasonable price. The staff were nice, the coffee in the foyer in the morning is great and we ate an Annabelles almost everynight!

<Content>Best Place in SF I had to go to SF for a conference for the first time in years, I was wary of hotels in the city because of the price. A friend told me about the Mosser, about what a cool place it was, like going back in time. And he was right! Even though I had to share a bathroom and shower, this was definitely one of the most fun places I had ever stayed, an equal to the Hotel Allegro in Chicago at half the cost. The location is great, close to everything, the price is great also. Only problem was with the large amounts of homeless that come to the area to panhandle where the business people and tourists are, but that is part of city living. Not the Mosser's fault. I stay at the Mosser now every time I go to SF and always look forward to it. I highly recommend the Mosser to everyone.

<Content>Loved the MOSSER! I booked everything online, and the only problem I had with the Hotel was actually finding it the night I got there! In fact, I had simply walked the wrong way. It's actually a 2 minute walk from the BART station on Powell Street! (Look for Walgreens. If you are standing in front of Walgreens, turn left. Walk to the end of the building/corner. Look right. You will see the sign.) Anyway, the ENTIRE Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The room was small, but in a really cool way I thought. For 2 people, it could be tight, but your San Francisco! You won't spend that much time in the room methinks! The bed was REALLY comfortable, and the bathroom/shower situation was absolutely NO problem at all. The bath pack the hotel gives is really nice, and the robes and towels are impeccably clean!The only problem I had while at the hotel was waiting for the elevator! I will be back to San Francisco, and I will be staying at The Mosser again!***If the woman whom I think I made a rude face at one evening is reading this, please accept my apology. I dropped my cell phone on my toe the instant I saw you! You were returning from the shower! You were room 604 Oct 19--------whenever...***

<Content>Great place to stay in San Francisco Had a wonderful visit at The Mosser -- a perfect location near the Powell Street cable turnaround, shopping, and BART. Frontdesk staff was always friendly and helpful -- a welcome relief for the weary traveler.As expected, the room was small -- but clean and adequate. The bath down the hall was always clean everytime I stepped in.I look forward to returning to this small hotel by the Bay.

<Content>A gem just off Market I've stayed at the Hotel Mosser several times, most recently in June 2007.I love it and plan to stay there next time I'm in SF.It's a quirky, charming hotel with fabulous staff. I've recognized the same staff over my last three stays (2005-2007), which tells me that it's a good place to work. And it's really nice to see familiar faces behind the desk. :-) Service has always been great.I usually travel alone on business, so I get the single room with the shared bath. On my last two stays, the private toilet was across the hall and the shared bath right next door, which worked out fine.My rooms have always been clean and secure. The room is small. You won't be throwing a party in there, unless it's just two of you. Maybe three. Rooms on the outside of the building can be noisy: I sleep with earplugs when I travel and have no problem. Rooms on the interior of the building are quiet, I'm told.WiFi is available in the room from ATT for about $10 per 24 hrs. Of course you can find free WiFi through the city.The Mosser is located about 1.5 blocks from Market St in one direction and Moscone Center in the other. I usually fly into SFO and take the BART downtown to the Powell St stop. It's easy walking distance from there to the hotel. Directly around the corner is Mel's Diner, where American Graffitti was filmed. Pricier restaurants are nearby.If you need lots of elbow room and amenities, there's a Marriott across the street. If you'd like an inexpensive place to stay, the Mosser is fabulous and you can use the money you save for drinks at the Marriott's swanky 39th floor cocktail lounge.

<Content>I love this place My first trip to SF and on quiet the budget. My friend and I stayed here for a week and we had no problems. We got a room with shared bath. The bathrooms were very clean and we didn't have any problems with them being to busy. The toliets were tight. Need to suck in that belly to close the door. That really didn't bother me at all. I just loved the great location and the excellent price. Very safe and easy to use the public transportation less than a block away. This is a great budget place to be. Don't expect the glitz. If you have it, go spend your $200 plus a night somewhere else. I am tired of people expecting a 5 star hotel at $70 a night.

<Content>seriously The rooms in this hotel are so ridiculously small they have become the standard against which every rip-off squeeze-box will have to be compared. I don't care how many cool amenities the place offers, the squeeze in unacceptable. The bed is too small for 2 normal adults (my husband  I weigh well under 300 pounds together), there's no room around this great bed, the bathroom sink in relation to the little shelf over it makes a dentist's spit sink seem luxurious. Our loose window was useless against the street noise--so we moved to an interior room on the top (8th?) floor. Of course the elevator didn't work-- hadn't for months!--but no help or compensation. Again, Michelin led us astray. There has to be a better place in SF--location ISN'T everything!

<Content>Read this review so you won't get fooled by the hotel!!!! HI Me and my husband stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. We ordered a double room with double bed.We got a very small room that we could hardly open our suitcases, but the worst part was the smallest bed ever!!! We asked to change our room, because of the small bed, but the receptionist said that all double beds in the hotel are at the same size and that the hotel stands in the USA standards of beds (even printed some paper with the bed sizes). A double bed is 54'' according to the USA standards. We asked to measure our bed and it was only 52''!!!!!Finally we got a different room with 2 single beds - much bigger then the double bed...I recommend to all measure your beds... don't let them fool you!!

<Content>Loved the Mosser The Mosser is a cool little gem in the SOMA area of San Fran. There is lots of great shopping and restaurants in the area. The only downfall is the homelessness issue, but we didn't find it threatening, just sad. The Mosser is an older building that's been converted into a boutique type hotel. The staff were friendly and efficient with no issues checking in. We stayed in September so there was not a problem with lack of air conditioning, but I can see how this might pose a problem during the summer months. The only significant complaint was outside noise from the streets. We stayed on the 7th floor in room 711. The window faced the back alley, and on one night there was a very loud garbage pick up with breaking glass. I found that ear plugs solved any major issues. There are windows above the doors in the suites, and even though they have blinds on them, a fair bit of light shines in from the hall. Again, by buying an eye mask, it relieved the problem is you're sensitive to light. All in all, I would stay here again just for the ambience and convenient location.

<Content>Excellent location, low price The hotel was in an excellent location and perfect for anyone young, single, and traveling alone. Yes, the rooms are as tiny as all the reviews say, but you can't beat the location. And really, how much time do you actually spend in the room.The hotel staff was courteous. Although the restaurant next door can't compete with San Francisco's finest, Annabelle's was great for a quick meal at the end of a long day.

<Content>Loved this place! Great Location. Yes, the rooms are small. Big Deal. However, the charm and location more than make up for the small room size. After all, who goes on vacation to sit in a hotel room and watch TV anyways!?!? My room was very clean and I appreciated all the little extras such as the flowers, bag of (useful!) goodies, and VERY comfortable bed.The Mosser Hotel is located in the most ideal location imaginable. About a 3 minute walk to the cable cars, close to many shops and convenience stores, Chinatown, Coit Tower, the Embarcadero, etc.Very unique hotel and reasonable rates as well.

<Content>Classy on a dime My husband and I went with another couple and were very happy with our stay. The Mosser is a Euro-style hotel, but we were fortunate to get an in-room bath. Although I peeked in the shared bathrooms and they weren't bad, just small.Some unique features of our stay were: A beautiful flower arrangement on our bed that greeted us when we walked in, a book containing the the philanthropic aspects of the hotel (yay!), a bag contaning sample projects (toothpaste, nice lotions, face scrub and a Harelquin Romance Novel- HA!). Also, suicide windows to keep out the noise below.The location is GREAT!!! I can't even emphasize this enough. Its right off market, a quick walk to Chinatown and Little Italy. Some things people may not like is the very tiny TV in the corner top portion of the room. Also, someone got shot down the street. Like, on the next block. It was all blocked off, so it was hectic, but the hotel staff was very honest about it and didn't make it a big issue. Really odd, its normally a safe area!Anyways, we loved it so much, I just booked our next trip to SF in December, and we are staying at the Mosser again!

<Content>location, location, location The location was absolutely brilliant! You're bang in the middle of everything! The hotel itself was nothing spectacular, not as clean as I would have liked but good enough.The breakfast was pretty much coffee and a cupcake so I'd suggest getting breakfast elsewhere, but if you wanna be right in the middle of the action and particularly the shops! It's a good hotel.

<Content>Great stay at the Mosser We really enjoyed our stay at the Mosser in September 07. Location is brilliant, very easy to find, just take the BART from the airport and walk less than a block!Staff were great, especially Mr Joe on the door. Desk staff were also very helpful - our tv went off at one point and the staff were there within 2 mins to fix it.Also got a great little 'welcome pack' - kind of a sample pack of sorts - it was unexpected but nice. Included a women's razor, candy, gum, cosmetic samples etc.Now the rooms are SMALL. Ours had 2 single beds (twin rooms only come with singles) and barely enough room to put our suitcases on the floor - BUT when in a city like San Francisco you really don't spend much time in your room, so it wasn't an issue. The bathroom was also small, and did lack shelf space.They provide free coffee in the lobby in the mornings (takeaway containers provided) and very small muffins - we tried them on the first morning but they were quite dry, perhaps just a bad batch but we didn't try them again after that! Coffee was great though!Definitely rec'd if you want a great location and friendly staff with a clean, comfortable room.

<Content>Web site is nothing like what you actually get, think fraud I booked myself into the Mosser in May 2007 using their Web site. The Web site makes the rooms look reasonably sized. In fact the room they gave me was less than 100 feet square. The Web site says the room comes with ceiling fans. What they don't say is that there is no air conditioning. The Web site says the room comes with double window panes to ensure a quiet nights sleep. The room was filled with loud traffic sounds as the hotel is on busy 4th street.I complained to the front desk. They said there was nothing they could do. They were not sold out. They showed me they just did not care.I said it is unfair to charge me for a room that did not deliver as advertised. They said I would have to pay for the first night.At $180/night there is not enough value to make the Mosser worthwhile at any time. There are many small hotels within 3-4 blocks that are between $100 and $125 and offer the same lousy experience as the Mosser.-Frank

<Content>Very Impressed I was traveling by myself on a budget and the Mosser was like staying at a 5 star hotel for only $62 p/night. I stayed 4nights and never had to wait for the bathroom, The hotel room and facilities were very clean and well presented. Great location so close to shopping and transport.

<Content>Great Deal for the $ My girlfriend and I recently visited San Francisco and stayed at the Mosser. It's nicely located near Union Square, the F line to Fisherman's Warf and airport transporation. Although the rooms are small (think European hostel), they make up for it with a modern look and welcome bag (gum, toothpaste, shampoo and conditioner, free CD). The showers/bathrooms are down the hall (think European hostel again) but you are supplied with a bath robe and towels. One thing I found interesting was that the Mosser uses a portion of it's hotel proceeds to replant trees (over 5 million already). Even if you're not a tree hugger, it's nice to know that someone cares enough about an issue to make that sort of effort. I pride myself on finding good travel deals and traveling on a budget (even though I don't have to). This is a great deal for the area (approx $90 after taxes for a queen bed for two). If Rick Steves wrote travel books for the US, I'm sure the Mosser would be on his list.

<Content>Mosser is great Such a cute hotel! When my boyfriend and I checked in during a trip the previous August, we were a little alarmed at the small room size at first; we're both used to family vacations, packing 7 people into the HoJo. It only took us a second to realize what a great hotel we had chosen - sophisticated, nicely furnished/decorated, little touches. Very cool artwork and a fantastic view of downtown San Fran. Awesome location on Market and 4th. We returned for my birthday the following February and didn't even check any other hotels. The restaurant/bar downstairs (the Annabelle, I believe) is a great late-night drinking spot whether or not you're staying in the hotel (there are several nearby, but we didn't find any other good bars). Make sure you get a deluxe room though - otherwise it's a community bathroom in the hall! Deluxe rooms are only marginally more expensive, and unless you're cool with dorm living, I would suggest it. Also - concierge was wonderfully accommodating, The first trip we drove from Nevada and had to park my boyfriend's car somewhere; the hotel had a parking lot and totally took care of it. We flew in for our second stay and they locked our luggage in the back for us after we checked out so we could continue to enjoy the city. Unless you're going to San Fran with the express purpose of sitting around in your hotel room all day, the Mosser is a great night's stay!

<Content>Excellent Customer Service from the Reservations Department I had an untimely situation occur regarding my booking arrangement with the Mosser. I was getting very little help from the internet third party 'book for cheap' customer service department. After much pressing, they got in touch with the hotel and I was able to get exactly the help I needed thanks to MARK from the Mosser in the Reservations department. He was very understanding and extremely helpful. I am very grateful to him. I recommend the Mosser for humanistic and personal customer service.

<Content>Great Location Enjoyed staying at The Mosser due to the great location. It's so close to everything, BART, shops and heaps more. We got an upgrade for only a few dollars more so turned out to be fantastic value. The staff were all very friendly.Only downside would be the size, the rooms were very small and we had a crawling baby with us so we found it too small but we managed. However on a positive note they did have a crib which was the only place out of 4 that we stayed at that had them!A good place to stay to get your bearings.

<Content>Wow!!! We wanted to stay somewhere in the city, that wasn't too expensive. We were surprised when we got a room at this hotel for $65 a night (with a private bath). It is in the middle of Union Square! This is a cool place to stay, no matter what your budget is. They have hostel style rooms that share a bath down the hall, small rooms with private baths, and suites. I would definately recommend this hotel to all of my friends. It has modern decor and a very smart use of space in the small rooms.

<Content>Elegance in a PRIME location... PRIME location, impeccable, charming hotel...LOVED it!!Beautiful period hotel newly updated and renovated provides the supreme tourist experience. I loved every aspect about this hotel. I travel primarily in Europe so am accustomed to shared bath/toilet. A small but incrediblly efficient room which was loaded with so many extras...small cable T.V. ceiling fan, sink with free manufacturers samples, internet/TV, alarm clock in T.V., CD player/radio/alarm clock, terrycloth robes, coffee/muffins for breakfast in lobby, telephone, IKEA type bed which was very comfortable, lovely pillows/bedspread, quality fabric. Just steps away from the BART/MUNI and shopping galore. Very safe location which is well lit and well traveled. I can't wait to return to THE MOSSER HOTEL!!

<Content>Good value stay Only ended up staying the night as our flight was delayed into Chicago and we missed our connection. Room was small but htere was just enough room for the 2 of us plus 2 large suitcases. Although due to the lack of hanging space you couldn't stay longer than a few days. Location was excellent and the room was clean and compactly furnished. Plus the price was spot on compared to other hotels we had priced.

<Content>Brilliant value What a deal - $99/night for a twin bed room with ensuite bathroom in the center of SF. I'd call it a boutique hotel in that it is nicely renovated and has lots of charm. The staff were friendly and efficient, the rooms tidy and nicely decorated. I'll be staying here again.

<Content>Excellent in almost every respect. First of all, The Mosser is not for everyone. If you are a traveler who enjoys amenities like a pool/spa, exercise facility, room service, or if you prefer to stay in suites or upgraded rooms, The Mosser really isn't what you're looking for. There are many hotels in the same area that are more in this vein, and you would be better off going with them.On the other hand, if you're a traveler on a budget and you're more concerned with the location and price of the hotel than the hotel itself, The Mosser is exactly what you're looking for. I would basically describe The Mosser as half-way between a hostel and a typical hotel, and much nicer than any hostel you'd ever stay in. For the price, I don't think there's a better deal in all of San Francisco. We paid $99 for a shared-bathroom queen bed room, and we stayed two nights. I would absolutely go back and stay with them again.The location can't be beat - it's within eyesight of the Metreon theater and right in the middle of the big Union Square shopping district. It's also within a block of the Union Square muni/BART stations and the Market St. Cable Cars. If you want to go anywhere in the city, there's a method of transportation that will get you there, and they all come right by The Mosser, which means you won't have to spring for a taxi if you don't want to. The muni trains, busses, and cable cars are an excellent, cheap, and fun way to get around the city. With this kind of location I feel like The Mosser could charge twice what they're asking; for $99 a night it's an amazing deal, and being in a good location makes a big difference when you want to go out and do stuff.The facilities at The Mosser themselves were outstanding. The room was decorated in bright colors with interesting artwork on the walls. The bed was comfortable - a pillow-top, I'm pretty sure, which is rare for a budget hotel bed. Nice sheets. The toilets in the hallway were always clean, and the bathrooms were perfectly adequate. A couple times we noticed that the water pressure in the showers went down, but it's an old building and that happens. The lobby was very bright and eloquent. Overall the facilities were above and beyond what we'd hoped for. Most of all, there are a lot of little details that you notice at The Mosser. They gave us band-aids, a shoe polishing cloth, and a CD created at their music studio in their little hotel kit, which was left on the bed along with a vase of flowers. Little things like that go a long way, and they impressed us a great deal.The staff at The Mosser was also exceptional. Having stayed in a few, but not many hotels, I can say that the staff is the number one thing I'm wary of the most when traveling. Luggage gets lost or banged around, reservations get messed up, people are gruff and generally unpleasant... none of this happened at The Mosser. From the bellman to the clerk at the desk to the valet parking, everyone was pleasant, cheerful, helpful, and efficient. Never once was I unsatisfied with a staff member, and this is sadly a rarity when I travel anymore. For what The Mosser is, it's amazing. It's not a luxury hotel. It's not a posh resort. It's a nice, clean, upbeat, contemporary little hotel with little rooms for a tiny little price. If that sounds like it's up your alley, I would definitely urge you to check it out.

<Content>Pristine Excellence at The Mosser The Mosser Hotel is located at the heart of great shopping, fantastic restaurtants, and wonderful sightseeing experiences. The darling hotel lobby was very comfortable to sit and stay the few moments it takes for the professional bellmen to hail a taxi service, load your luggage and confirm destination plans and directions with you and the driver. The lobby was always fully staffed with knoweldgable and efficient workers. Once inside the hotel room, each guest is greeted with an overflowing welcome package, containing San Francisco travel books, a reading enjoyment book, gum, and all the immenities you may need while away from home. To continue the at home ambiance, each room has a wonderful view with windows that open and close, allowing you to choose your air circulation preference and comfort level. The room has comfortable reading chairs with plenty of lamp lighting, a ceiling fan and ornate bed pillows to finish the at home feeling. My most memorable experience was dealing with the efficient bellmen. They used speed and knowledge to aid in selecting a sight seeing tour that would fit my time schedule and interest. Even with waiting until well-beyond the recommended sign up time, the bellmen were able to process my tickets, moments before the motor coach pulled up to gather the other hotel tourists. I was most impressed with their courtesy and professionalism. It was a very comfortable and accomodating memory of San Francisco. When I return to the area, I will be happy to stay at this fine Hotel.

<Content>Highly Recommend We enjoyed our stay here tremendously. The staff was intuitively accommodating, and very friendly. The rooms are quaint, but efficient, and shouldn't hinder your stay unless you are planning a long (week +) vacation (no dressers, but they have a closet).There are a lot of places, number-wise and geographically, to stay. This I have to mention, because we broke our trip up throughout the city, was probably one of the best for location, and absolutely for price. The restaurant, Annabelle's, was fabulous especially when we were too tired to go too far.Overall the beds are super comfy, the entire hotel was very clean, and the decor along with the hand sketched art are a nice personal touch. Plus it was less than 50 yards to Market St. and all of the fun stuff downtown. We have a lot of places to visit, but if we ever go back to San Fran I would love to stay again at the Mosser and support them and their environmental research mission.

<Content>LOCATION ONLY If location is what you are looking for - this is it!!!! It is across the street from the Marriott and 2 doors down from the Palomar. It is a short hop to everywhere you want to be! BART is around the corner. The other reviews about the size of the rooms is correct. One person max is all the space the room has. This is small even by San Francisco standards. However, I did not go to SF to stay in my room. The coffee is good but the rolls should be skipped. This is an old hotel with one elevator. My first night the radiator burped loudly at 4:30 am! All and all, I would stay there again.

<Content>We would go back in a heartbeat! The Mosser exceeded our expectations. The location was excellent. We are able to walk to every place that we wanted to shop and to the baseball game with no problem. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean and comfortable. We had a room that had a community shower and I was a little nervous about how that would work but it was fine. I never had to wait to use it and there was never anyone in the bathroom when I needed it. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would absolutely stay at the Mosser again. If you can loking for a nice place in the middle of everything then the Mosser is for you.

<Content>Very cute, clean, great location! We were very pleased with our four night stay at The Mosser. The hotel is very well kept, clean, and the staff was very helpful. It is so nice to stay in a hotel with character rather than one of the bigger, impersonal chains. Our room was nicely decorated and the ceiling fan came in very handy (you do not need AC). The staff was always very helpful and courteous. We also loved the location, which is in the middle of everything and very close to a BART stop. Bottom line: we hope to make The Mosser our hotel of choice for future trips to the city.

Definitely considering going back again soon. I highly recommend going to the 39th floor in the hotel across the street for a nightcap.

<Content>The Mosser Rocks! The Mosser Hotel is perfectly located in downtown San Francisco and provides one with an ideal starting point for sight seeing in the city. Located right next to Bart station, and minutes from California St., you can't beat the location and access to the entire city. The staff is courteous and helpful, and the rooms and overall decor is modern and stylish. The hotel is reasonably priced given that you are in an expensive city. Overall a hotel that should be booked anytime you come and visit San Francisco.

<Content>OK for money This hotel was not as nice as the hotel's website led us to believe. the pictures showed much more up market rooms than we actually got. it is an old hotel and not one that is bright and contemporary like their website makes out!that being said, it was adequate for the 4 nights that we spent there on our tour of California. The location was excellent and the beds were extremely comfortable, which was great as we were dealing with jet lag at the time.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't mind a budget place, but don't be fooled by the hotels website.

<Content>good location but...... The Mosser is certainly in a good location and the absence of AC is not a problem, we slept well with the ceiling fan on. However the room photos would led you to believe this is a modern boutique style hotel, and maybe some of the rooms are as shown but our was not. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms with shared bathroom are fine. But do not expect the high end rooms as the seem in the pictures. Location excellent, 5 mins from Powell st tram stop. complimentary tea, coffee and small muffins in the morning.

<Content>very small but very nice and convenient We have been at The Mosser for 5 nigts finding it very well located, very nice and clean.Yes the room is really small but with nice furniture and we where in San Francisco for visitng the city so we didn't need a spacious room.We booked the hotel on hostelworld.com paying a room with ensuite bathroom just 70 euros per night.When we arrived in the room we found also the nice surprice of a little present: a music cd made by the recording center of the hotel.I reccomend this hotel to all the people who want visit the city!

<Content>THE MOSSER IN SAN FRAN We thought the Mosser was just great. The staff was very friendly and personable compared to the service you get from one of those chains. The rooms were small indeed, but comfortable and quiet and very clean. Location is close to serveral types of public transportation and to nice restaurants and bars. We'll definitely return!

<Content>Mosser -- Excellent location and value! Pros: Excellent downtown location; adjacent to very large shopping mall and trolley 'F' line which takes you down Market street to the Pier's and Fisherman's Wharf. Also, the hotel is a restored 'Victorian style' building -- at one point of the building's existence, I'm sure it use to have gorgeous views of the bay before all the skyscrapers came into the scene. They also have free coffee in the morning -- which comes in large size, to go cups. The hotel staff was wonderful and friendly.Potential Con: It wasn't really a concern for me, but some people may not like the smaller rooms. My room was just large enough to fit the Queen size bed inside; and that was about it. My room included a small bathroom, too, which was nice - but with some of the rooms one has to share bathrooms out in the hallway. Of all the hotels I've stayed in, this had to be the smallest room I've ever stayed in -- but honestly, it was still clean and nice; I really didn't spend much of my day in the hotel room. The location is totally worth the $69-89 price range per night; you won't find this kind of price anywhere else in downtown San Francisco.Highly recommend!

<Content>Absolutely fine! During our train trip around the US, we stayed five nights at the Mosser and were very satisfied. Although it wasn't exceptional, we have absolutely nothing to complain about and the value was great, especially since we got upgraded to a room with bathroom paying for one without... Contrary to others, I thought the coffee in the lobby was a good idea. A cup of coffee is exactly what I need in the morning, and then I am happy to wait a while before having breakfast. Location is also fine, particularly since it is - literally - next door to the complex of Yerba Buena Gardens/Metreon/MoMA, which has something for everyone. I loved the arts and the bar on the terrace, my son loved the movie-theatre and the Playstation-store. We took the cable car once, for the sake of it, but walked otherwise almost everywhere. The area is a bit depressing night-time, with lots of homeless people (why?), but we never felt unsafe. And although I agree with those who say the Mosser has a bit of Ikea-feeling over it, with cheap design, I still think it is a good choice. And since San Francisco is such a great city, you don't spend a lot of time in the hotel room anyhow!

<Content>Great location! Small, clean rooms, and helpful staff. We stayed at the Mosser for just one night, but the hotel was clean and comfortable, although a little noisy as we were right across the hall from the ice machine. We stayed in a European style room, i.e. - no bathroom or shower, but for the price you really can't beat it. The bathroom and shower area were both clean. The hotel is walking distance to Union Square and lots of restaurants and shopping. The rooms are quite small, but I'd highly recommend it if you just need a place to crash.

<Content>Have recommended it to everyone I booked my room at the Mosser only about 10 days before I travelled and was so pleased to get an excellent rate for such a great room in such a perfect location. Friends I met in SF could hardly believe I had found such an excellent deal.The room was small, but well laid out. Contrary to some other recent reviews I have no complaints about cleanliness. The room was spotless each day when I returned to it each evening.I was nervous beforehand about the shared hall bathrooms, but I hardly met anyone in the hallways and only once had to wait for another guest to finish in the bathroom which was right next to my room. These weren't cleaned in between each use, but they were thoroughly cleaned each day and were much cleaner than those you'd often find in a gym, etc.I had also been worried that the central location would mean a lot of noise, but where my room was it was very quiet, even with 4th July holiday and the baseball Fan Fest going on.I really recommend that if you're visiting SF or if you live there and have guests coming to stay you check out the Mosser and snap it up if you can get a room.

<Content>Worst Hotel Experience This morning, on her way out of the hotel, my sister accidentally left her wallet on her bed. She realized it a few minutes later and went back to the hotel. When she got up to her room, house-keeping already cleaned it, and her wallet was gone. She spoke the manager at the time (Mark), and he had her go through all of the dirty and clean laundry. When I walked through the door of the hotel, I said, My sister lost her wallet... His response was, so she SAYS. I was a bit unnerved by that response so I went to check on my sister, who was in the process of going through the pile of dirty sheets. While she was digging, I decided to talk to Mark again. The whole time I was talking to him, he wouldn't look at me. HIS EYES WERE STARING OUT THE DOOR AS I SPOKE. I had to pause, ask him what was outside because I was trying to talk to him. He looked back at me, I spoke, and his eyes wondered back outside. I know it was my sister's fault for leaving her wallet behind, but he, as a manager, DID NOT EVEN PRETEND TO BE HELPFUL. He plain out said that I don't believe that she left it here. She must have dropped it outside. I had picked her up from outside the hotel. She got into my car, we drove around for 15-30mins before she realized she didn't have her wallet, and we went back to the hotel. While I was sitting by the door waiting for the police to come take our report, he didn't have any problems looking into other people's eyes to talk to them. I can't believe how poorly we were treated by Mark. He strongly believed that my sister didn't leave her wallet in her hotel room and that she must've dropped it outside (which makes it not his fault for not being able to find it). He also told me that no one has ever left their wallet in their hotel room/this has never happened before. Anyway, he's the type who'll treat people well when everything runs smoothly. Yet when things do happen, we're the idiots for booking a room there, and he'll treat us as such.

<Content>Never again We had high hopes for The Mosser. We did read the review here about the scabies, but thought it might just be a one-off. But, whilst neither my husband nor myself contracted scabies during our stay, we both felt we needed a good scrub down after staying at this hotel. It was filthy, particularly the bath. One of the complimentary robes had blood stains on it, as did the bed sheets! It really is one of the filthiest hotels I've ever stayed in. There was no room service to speak of, not even coffee/tea making facilities, or water in the rooms or available anywhere in the hotel. You could order pizza from their restaurant during specific hours, but really, who wants to eat only pizza on holiday? The furnishings were cheap - don't pull the blinds, they'll come away from the window and hit you on the head! Breakfast was a cup of coffee from a thermos in paper cups in the hotel lobby and as many tasteless, dry muffins as you can stuff in your hungry mouth. I have to say this hotel was a real disappointment. San Fran does not seem to have got the boutique hotel thing just yet. Avoid the Mosser if you can, and if you can't take some antibacterial wipes and rubber gloves with you because you may spend your break cleaning your own room!!

<Content>Great Small Accomodations for the Price I always check the Mosser when traveling to SF because it is perfect for one or two people for a no frills but very clean stay. The rooms are tiny, but they are stylish, comfortable and very clean (think Ikea). Since the Mosser was recently renovated, it has newer beds and avoids the bedbug problem that ALOT of SF hotels have. Yikes. Anyway, they are VERY close to everything, right on Market and 4th near the MUNI and BART and shopping and for the price, you just can't beat it. To boot, they are friendly and efficient. Free coffee and donuts in the morning.Hope that helps.

<Content>Perfect for a San Francisco getaway... I've stayed at the Mosser quite a few times, and I'm always happy with my experience. I'm a younger traveller, and I will be the first to admit that my needs are simple: clean room, comfy bed, close to attractions/method of getting to attractions (bus, train, etc), and thick walls (I'm a light sleeper), and something that's not a chain. Mosser fits the bill in all these ways, AND you should check out its corporate responsibility... quite awesome. I would certainly recommend the in room bathroom, however (I am young, but am still not prepared to relive dorm memories) and also try for a corner room.

<Content>Best value in S.F. The Mosser Hotel exceeded my expectations, based on previous TripAdvisor postings. My chief criterion for this particular stay was to get as inexpensive room as possible in a relatively safe, convenient location. Beyond that, though, I was very impressed with how nicely maintained, refurbished, and furnished the hotel was. All was very clean and comfortable.The desk clerk at the time of my arrival, Tim, was as polite and helpful as could be. I arrived early morning and wanted to drop off my suitcase but he checked and saw my room was available so let me check in around 9am. His gracious greeting and assistance set a wonderful tone for my brief stay.I will certainly try to stay at the Mosser again in the future. I consider it the best value hotel I've encountered so far in this city.

<Content>Great hotel in a great location My wife and I trawled the internet trying to find a hotel in San Francisco that wasn't going to cost us a small fortune. Then a friend of ours told us about The Mosser. What a find! This hotel is in the best location in San Francisco. It's about 1 minute walk to Market Street where you will find great shopping, (most of it in the Westfield centre) and the Bart and Muni transport stops. Getting around the city from The Mosser is very easy. On that point, it is a lot cheaper just to get the Bart to Powell Street stop from the airport and walk 2 minutes to the hotel than pay for a taxi or shuttle bus.The rooms, as some people have said, are small but the are spotless and modern and let's face it, how much time are you planning on spending in your room anyway? We had a room with a private bathroom but the shared facilities still looked very clean and well maintained.If you can get a good deal on The Mosser you'd be mad not to stay here.

<Content>Would higly recommend the Mosser We really liked the Mosser. After a week of staying in motels the small sized room in the Mosser was initially a bit of a shock. However, the hotel had provided everything we needed including a welcome pack, good value laundry and TV. We had shared bathroom facilities, but these were clean and we never had to wait to use them. All the staff were very friendly and helpful,and the hotel had a nice feel to it. The hotel is perfectly situated down town, within walking distance of all the shops, cable cars and the coast. I would highly recommend it.

<Content>Stylish and cheap I stayed here recently on a short, and relatively cheap, city break to San Francisco, and was pleasantly impressed. I got the cheapo option of a single room with shared bathroom, which was nicer than one might expect. The room was well designed and comfortable, although very small, and the bathrooms clean and usually free of other travellers. While there was no AC, the ceiling fan did the job and didn't make too much noise. There was a CD player / alarm and a selection of sample size toiletries in addition to the usual soap / shower gel etc. My only real bugbear about the room design was that the bed was made up into a sofa which didn't face, or even come close to facing, the TV; while there was a small shelf on the wall where your head would most naturally rest to watch it if you shifted the cushions around.Otherwise, however, the location was excellent; the staff friendly and helpful, and the free coffee, tea and muffins in the morning a handy alternative to spending a fortune on breakfast next door.

<Content>Great place to stay in San Francisco We stayed at the Mosser for 3 or 4 nights in February and loved it. It was a great location, and the price was definitely right (found a good price through kayak.com, which directed us to skoosh.com to finalize our stay). We had a room with a private bath. The room was pretty small, but it was fine for us. The bath was very clean with good water pressure.The desk staff was always very helpful in providing directions, recommending restaurants, or directing us to the right bus/streetcar/etc. Some of the previous reviews mentioned noise, so we asked for a quiet room away from street noise. We could hear people coming and going from the communal bath nearby, but it wasn't a big deal. The elevator was being refurbished during our stay, so we had to walk up/down six flights of stairs to our room. But I imagine that is probably fixed by now and it wasn't a huge problem for us in the first place.Overall a great place to stay if you're on a budget but still want someplace nice and clean.

<Content>Do not stay here!!!! Beware! Do not stay here! I have traveled extensively all around the world, both business and leisure and let me say I have stayed in youth hostels that were cleaner and more professionally run than the Mosser. It is unclean, unsafe, the staff was rude, I could go on and on. First of all upon arriving the bellman allowed me to get my 75 lb suitcase out of the car without even an offer to help. the front desk clerk was rude, and would not answer my questions about the hotel or the rooms and bathroom situation (I had feared having a room with a shared bath.), and further more the manager wasn't any better. They declined to accept my credit card for incidentals because it didn't match the cc on the reservation (it was my companies CC, the reservation was made by corporate), they were unwilling to listen to my explanation and I had to call my CEO on the East coast at 11pm to get him to authorize my incidental charges with the CC the reservation was made with. Then comes the room. There were stains all over the bed, a bug in the bathtub, it smelled like yesterdays trash, and was sweltering hot because of the lack of air conditioning. Do not listen to the reviews that say this is a great value, I am now staying at the Warwick Regis for less than the Mosser was costing. Shop around there are great hotels at decent prices, but whatever the case Do Not Test Your Luck, Stay Away From The Mosser!!!

<Content>Good Location/OK hotel I spent 3 nights in May 2007 at the Mosser Hotel, and found it a good option if you're not concerned about major amenities and just want a place to sleep at a good location. Pros: The location was great. You're within a block and a half of Bart/the Muni's main rail line, the Cable Car turnaround point, and the main visitor information center, plus all kinds of stores. I had everything I needed in the room, and it was clean and an efficient use of space. The place is well run, and the people running the hotel were polite and helpful. Cons: The room is small. One person's fine, two had better be friendly. There's also limited storage if you're staying more than a long weekend and have graduated beyond everything fits in a backpack status. Don't drive a car while staying there if possible. It cost me $28 a night in parking. It has a restaurant, but it's not cheap. Bottom line: I got a discounted rate through Hotwire. At the under $100 rate I paid, it was a good deal. Would the location justify paying more? Maybe, but I wouldn't pay extra to stay there over another hotel in the area.

<Content>great location and clean! Within 2mins walk to Union Sq and Powell St train station, and 10mins walk to Ferry Building. Clean, even the shared bathroom is clean. Room is small, but clean, has TV and internet is in the TV, and the room has modern furnishings. This is very good for the money and location.

<Content>Small rooms, great location Yes, the rooms are really small but this hotel is a great deal for the location it is in. We had two separate stays at The Mosser at the beginning and end of a California road trip. Both times we had a room that included a bathroom (but from what I saw of the hall bathrooms they looked clean and acceptable). The bed in the first room we stayed in was comfortable, but I thought on the second stay in a different room the bed was in bad shape (or it just could have been my desire to be in my own bed after staying in four different hotels over the course of a week!). The rooms and lobby have been nicely updated and they make good use of the small space. The valet parking is pretty slow. They tell you to call 30 minutes before you need your car and when we were checking out we had a long wait until our car was finally retrieved. The Mosser was great for our short stays, but I think I would feel a bit claustrophobic in the room after a few days. The location is excellent - within walking distance of ATT Park, downtown shopping, BART station, and cable car.

<Content>Awsome Little Gem.... We Stayed in San Fran last week for a conference and I stayed at the Hotel my company chose for over 230.00 a night. We had decided to stay a extra night ahead of time on our own budget. Well we chose the right hotel. We could not have been more pleased with the staff and bellman. I was very impressed by their friendliness and hospitality. Nice very clean lobby, well decorated. I was very pleased with the room we stayed in a shared bath queen and although the room is small, it is very clean and decorated, and the bed was very soft. The only thing I would like to see is the TV removed from the foot of the bed and small plasma's or LCD's installed on the walls. But I still was very impressed with the Mosser.If I would have known I could have saved my company a lot of money and booked all nights at the Mosser.It is close to shopping, BART, MUNI and the cable line at Powell St.I will surely stay here again on my next visit. Do not hesitate to stay here you will be happy with this place.

<Content>Old-fashioned SF charm Old-fashioned SF charm, with modern comforts and good price! A true delight! In easy walking distance of Powell Street Cable Car, Union Square, Metreon, Yerba Buena gardens, SFMOMA, UC Berkeley Extension South of Market Center, BART stations. Hotel staff very professional, friendly, knowledgeable of the city. Staffers anticipate your needs. Rooms retain original Victorian architecture: sink, large window, small room, high ceilings, no AC, ceiling fan. Narrow stair cases lead to the floors -- but also an elevator. Rooms are updated in smart way: window that opens for fresh air, dual-pane to block street noise, comfortable bed, multi-line phone, internet access, tv. The less-expensive rooms have a common toilet  shower/tub on the hall, shared between guests. Rooms with private bath are available. Everything is exceptionally clean. (And always the case - I'm a repeat customer.) Robes are supplied because of common toilet/bath. Secure -- after midnight your key is required to enter the building, a desk clerk is present day and night. Safe area -- surrounded by other hotels, restaurants, stores. Probably best for singles or couples, since rooms are small (in a Victorian way) and stair cases are narrow and turn. No need for car, since in the heart of the city. Doorman can whistle a cab for you, if you don't want to walk.

<Content>Great value, great location! I read great reviews about this hotel and booked two single rooms for me an my dad and stayed on a Sat  Sun at the end of March. I went for the single room with bathroom/shower in the hall. I booked via Expedia and paid about $62 per night per room incl. tax. The room was small but very tidy and had a comfortable bed. Everything was very clean. The showers in the hall were always clean and we did not have any problems getting access to them. I would have given 5 stars but the guy at the reception when we checked out was in such a bad mood / bordering on rude that he hardly answered when I asked whether I could leave my luggage while I collected my rental car. But still overall a very good place if you travel on a budget.One final point: The stairs are very narrow and all surfaces are covered with carpets and there is lots of wood. If there is ever going to be a fire (heaven forbid!) evacuating this place is likely to be a nightmare. I look into safety related issues a lot at work and that was something on my mind during my stay.

<Content>Great cheap find If your on a budget, this is a great, clean and nice place to stay. Staff is great! I stayed in a single room to myself, which had a sink, tv, robes, all needed soap, shampoo, lotions ect., comfy bed. You do have to share bathroom and shower if you want the cheap rate. They do have regular hotels rooms with bathrooms included, but they are a little more expensive. The location is outstanding......Right by union square, close to street car, muni bus, and a short walk to cable car. Also, if you are catching a Giants game, it is a 1-2 mile walk. Definately will go back. I am picky when it comes to hotels.....this is clean and very quaint.From Santa Monica resident

<Content>Nice location, good price I am glad i stayed here. The staff was very nice. Got a decent price on the room, i think it was like $70 or so. Keep in mind they get you for $25-30 a night to park. They also lost my car for an hour when i was checking out. The location is nice, next to public transportation and within walking distance to the Giant's ballpark. The room was small and the bed was smaller, but all in all it was a fun place to stay, different than the standard motels, so fun. Would look into staying here again if i returned to SF because it was good deal and nothing negative can be said about this place.G Man

<Content>Funky, fun hotel My sister and I stayed at the Mosser for one night just for fun. We booked the hotel on Hotwire for $52/night mid-week and got a double room with insuite bath. The hotel was totally cute, clean, and in a great location. Yes, the hotel room was really small - New York City small - but at that price we didn't care. We were on the 8th floor in a corner room with a full view of The Metreon. Noise level was fine as long as you keep the windows closed. The room stays cool enough if you leave the window open before bed then turn on the fan. We'd definitely stay here again - just not at the hotel's normal rate.

<Content>Believe it or not, there are better hotels for cheaper in Union Sq! I am a SF native and love to spend weekends in hotels in Union Square for shopping and sightseeing. Of course, I am always on the lookout for great deals. The Mosser charges rack rate of $239 for a queen bed room with ensuite bathroom. I think that's too expensive and not as economical as people think. My favorite, Petite Auberge, is a beautiful French-style bed and breakfast north of Union Square on Bush Street. It is only a few blocks' walk to Union Square, and I daresay it is no further from the Square than Mosser Hotel. I usually stay in a queen bedroom with ensuite bath AND fireplace, for $155, and a full hot breakfast is included. The bedroom is much larger than the Mosser's queen bedroom. So, which is better value? I always send all my out of town friends to Petit Auberge, or its cheaper neighbor, Golden Gate Hotel (same street and literally next door to each other). I did enjoy my stay at Mosser, but only because I got to stay there free through a friend. Compared to a BB, Mosser is of course more hip and modern, but it is at a price. The renovated rooms are tiny (read all the reviews here), the bath is tiny and fan is noisy, there is no A/C, and my window looked directly into another guest's window so no privacy. Moreover, the Victorian building feels gritty, a bit like a residential hotel, and the crowd seems a bit gritty and urban and edgy (they rent the hotel rooms out by the week or month, so it feels a bit like a hostel). There is no breakfast in bed, the adjacent restaurant only opens at 11.30 AM. So I went for breakfast at the W (great , stylishbreakfasts at XYZ restaurant!). I recommend staying at the Mosser only if you can get a cheap deal online. If you can only pay their rack rates, try a BB in Union Square for less $$$ and more space/value.

<Content>So So but good location I stayed at this hotel from March 2nd to March 5th. Location is very easy to find and truely well located and close to everything. However had a very tiny room no aircondition just a fan, couldn't open the window, and the room ressembled more to a prison than anything else. I was lucky that weather was great and most of the time I was out.I booked the room through traveolcity as a pckage with my trip and there was indication that elevator was not working but would be working for my dates. When I got to the hotel tired, was advised that my room is on the 8th floor and they can't do anything for it as I had already paid for the whole package so it is not their problem. They told me the only way is to pay $25 canadian to upgrade it to another room on the 4th floor.So the only good thing in my point of view is location all the rest is average, and the rooms honestly the one I had ( they clearly made me understand when you get deals or packages you will be getting the owrse rooms!!) a lot to desire.So if you are looking to be all the time outside, don't mind not having enough air to breath and location is important then this is a very budget place to be.From Vancouver Canada

<Content>Great Value Stayed on a saturday night for $99/night. Nice small room, good decor, very clean, bed not the most comfortable, location is great, noisey so bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Elevator is broken so you or the bell boy will have to carry the bags up the stairs. Very good for one night stay, if you stay longer, the lack of space may drive you crazy.

<Content>Fabulous ,,, but beware noise problems If you want value, location and have few demands on hotel facilities then the Mosser is just perfect. The rooms my be minute but they are high quality and contain everything you need, the service is great, the position perfect and the price is unbeatable (if you book online - the rack rate can sometimes be silly). There is however a significant but. In a recent visit I treated myself to one of the deluxe rooms with bathroom. Unfortuately that meant is was next to another room with a bathroom and you swiftly discover that the bathroom fans are not on a timer. The noise of the neighbourhood fan is much noiser than your own fan. On one night the fan was on all night and on another it went on at 6am and the occupant left the building with it still on. I was woken by the noise even though I had earplugs. Oh this was exacerbated by the fan at the other end of the room which served the public bathroom for those souls without one en suite. With both of them going, it was quite a noise.Until the management sort this out, I'd strongly recommend sticking to the cheaper non-en suite rooms.

<Content>Small but comfortable A great little hotel right in the middle of San Francisco. Location is the best thing about this hotel without a doubt. The small rooms are comfortable, and the TV whilst being small is adequate - but tell me, who spends a lot of time in their room whilst on holiday?Staff were efficient and friendly. No refridgerator in room, and showers had moderate pressure, so if you want a hot shower driving in your face, you might have to ask to see if it varies from room to room.One note, just watch out for the hold on your credit card that gets made to secure your room.

<Content>A Great Stay First and foremost, if you want a full experience of what San Francisco has to offer, this is an excellent place to stay without going broke. It's literally a five minute walk from Union Square, the Museum of Modern Art, Yerba Buena Gardens and the Westfield mall. Plus, it's accesible by almost every form of transportation (car, BART, Muni) since it's situated right on Market/4th. The lobby is small but nicely decorated and the hotel also features a recording studio. The rooms have a modern decor and are aesthetically pleasing, however, the single rooms are somewhat small (but not cramped). At first, I was skeptical of this place since I've never been to a hotel with shared bathroom/washroom facilities but I was pleasantly suprised. The bathroom was spotless, same goes for the washroom and each room was equiped with its own sink. If you're the germophobic type, they have rooms with ensuites. As an added bonus, the desk and housekeeping staff were probably the most friendly and helpful that I've ever encountered. Overall, this is an excellent way to enjoy the sights and sounds of San Francisco minus the sometimes pretentious attitudes of the downtown core.

<Content>Fashionable, affordable lil' gem, close to the action! The Mosser is the hidden jewel amongst the towering (and overpriced!) hotel giants in the San Francisco area. On every trip to SFO, I stay there - it has the best combination of affordable price, clean, modern rooms, and a great location! In addition, it has access (paid) to wireless broadband internet (which is more a necessity that a luxury these days!)I wish there were 10 stars - I would award them all..

<Content>Location, Location, Location!!! The Mosser Hotel offers clean, but small rooms in a location that makes renting a car totally unnecessary, unless of course you want to go on day trips out of the city. If you need to rent a car, there is a car rental place closeby on Folsom Street, as well as a municipal parking lot around the corner. It is VERY convieniently located to the BART (which brings you into SF from both airports), the Muni light rail, the F Market street cars (brings you from the Castro District all the way to Fisherman's Wharf), buses, and of course, the famous cable cars that the city is known for. The hotel staff were extremely helpful and offered helpful hints along with maps and directions. They' ll even valet your rental car!!! Love shopping?!?! Search no more! Walk across Market Street and you're in Union Square, where there's lots boutique shops as well as the well known stores like Macys (please note that Macys has a separate MENS store nearby), Sephora and DSW Shoes. Walk a little north and get some cheap eats in Chinatown. You can't go wrong at the Mosser. I also want to add that there was not a closet in MY room and I do not know if that is true of the other rooms. Since I was alone, that was not a problem, but if two of you are going, take space limitations vs big suitcases into consideration. There ARE drawers under the platform beds and a short rack to hang your clothes from. Do bring earplugs though if you are a light sleeper; the guests that have the hallway bathrooms can wake you up when the door slams behind them. Ask about weekly rates and you can get a deluxe room that INCLUDES private bath! If you want a clean, reasonably priced hotel in an UNBEATABLE location, along with EASY access to public transportation, then look no further! The Mosser is an answer to your prayers.

<Content>nice place to stay at a reasonable cost stayed at this place right after the new year. elevator was still being worked on, lucky they found me a small room on the 3rd floor. and small it was, probably one of the smallest rooms i ever stayed in. the 2 rooms near the the elevator and between the 2 staircases are the smallest ones in the building, but for 1 person it fit the bill. it is located on 4th street, across the marriot and a block away from the metreon, the movie complex. it is around the block from the powell street bart station so very close. I used the bart to come and go to san francisco to the airport, very convenient at $5.15 each way.My only gripe was that the room I was in was above the driveway to the parking garage so at all hours of the day or night there was a buzz of approaching cars for the pedestrians on the sidewalk outside. still, for $55 a night for 2 nights including all taxes and fees it was a great price and great location.

<Content>Great location, simple but lovely Stayed for a little less than a week, with the idea of seeing as much of San Francisco as possible, with a central base to get back to that is safe, 3-4star standards. The Mosser fits all this and more.We stayed on the fourth floor, double bed ensuite. It was just perfect. Bit small but all the room we needed for 2. Bathroom was clean, room service was great. Everyone from concierge to the luggage guy were polite and friendly.No tea making facilities but we're simple travellers and prefer the cafes around the area downstairs that were only a few minutes walk away. Also had a bar/ resturant downstairs that does great food. worth a try.Location wise, we were just down the road from the IMAX cinemas, and around the corner from all the major shops! The Mosser didn't have homeless loitering around its area like some other more major hotels. Think its location, with two other hotels in its vacinity, made it a bit more of an accomodation area.I've recommened this place to other people. as for myself, will be stopping by San Francisco again this year and plan to stay at The Mosser again.

<Content>Like a European B I stayed there several times when it was Mosser's Victorian. The rooms were small but charming, with clean bathrooms down the hall. It was much like the BBs, pensiones, and guest hotels I have enjoyed in Europe. The location is great, just off Market Street and near the Moscone Convention Center. The price then was excellent for expensive San Francisco (about $80-90), but now I see that it has tripled since the renovation.

<Content>The Awesome Mosser I don't know if there is a better place to stay on a trip to San Francisco! The Mosser is that good. The location is unbelievable (directly in the middle of the best shopping Frisco has to offer AND at the end of the Hyde Line Trolley Car!) and the atmosphere is absolutely perfect. I truly think the Mosser has the best staff of any hotel I have ever stayed in. They are polite, knowledgable, friendly, helpful, and professional. They just don't miss. The rooms are great, offering an excellent view of downtown San Francisco, and they provide everything a traveler could need. The bathrooms are nice, the beds are really comfortable, and if you need food, you don't have to leave the building. The food at Annabelle's (the restaurant on the first floor), is excellent. And then there is the price. The Mosser undoubtedly offers the best quality/value ratio in the city. All other hotels in this area run at least double the price of the Mosser and most have much less to offer. Definitely book your room here. You won't be sorry!

<Content>Really nice romantic hotel Hey,I spent three nights at the Mosser this thanksgiving.I booked it because I found a really good deal (less than 100 dollars a night) , as in San francisco lodging is really expensive.So the Mosser has a great location!Union square! If you wanna shop it is perfect! It is also convenient close to BART and trolley stations.About the room:Yeah it was really small! It actually really looked like my student room lol but it was nicely furnished!(we got a room with the bathroom).It reminded me the paramount hotel in NYC but more cosy and less classy.The ladies at the reception were really welcoming as well.The on ly bad things is that the walls were really really thin....So I let you imagine what I could hear through them...like a lady and her husband who were really enjoying their night...this was awful but if you re willing to knock on wall the noise usually stopped....Then the light from the corridor was lighting the room....Anyhow it was a great hotel...a litle bit expensive but I think all hotels in SF and especially around Union Square are expensive...

<Content>Good location, cozy rooms While the room was small, it was beautifully decorated. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, loaning me a phone charger when I had forgotten mine. They also were able to suggest a restaurant for lunch that none of us had ever tried - even two SF residents - that was perfect.

<Content>Good location for a reasonable price The hotel is located 5 minutes from the the cable car station powell street. The rooms are very small but clean. Parking is quite expensive with 30 dollars per night but this is a normal price for parking in downtown. I would go there again if I come to San Fransisco for a second time.

Internet access through TV was good and rates reasonable. Reception staff helpful. Centrally located and within walking distance to a lot of attractions.

<Content>Super boutique hotel! My husband and I stayed at the Mosser for four nights for a trip that was both business and pleasure. When we arrived, we dropped our car with the valet and entered the spacious lobby. We were greeted right away by one of the most friendly front desk staffers we've ever encountered. He gave us organic apples to snack on after our long car trip. This hotel seems very environmentally friendly - something that is important to us. We found our room to be very spacious - something I was concerned about after reading some Trip Advisor comments. I'm not sure what they were talking about. Our room was plenty spacious and the bathroom was obviously recently renovated - all the fixtures were beautiful. The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed the CD player in the room.This was a fun place to stay - the staff was very helpful and upbeat. One of them even convinced me to record a song in the sound studio they have off the lobby! Always ready to help us find a place for dinner or direct us to the correct cable car line. The location of the hotel could not have been better - right in Union Square. After our business during the day, we had plenty of opportunity for shopping (a new and beautiful shopping center has just opened nearby) and the cable cars are under a block away.This was a great hotel for both business and pleasure - we will certainly stay here again!

<Content>they are not lying...! ok... so I read the whole deal about the rooms being small... THEY ARE NOT LYING!This was officially the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in - and we went for the room with its own bathroom. There was basically about 2.5ft on either side of the bed and that was it. The sink is in the bedroom and there is no wardrobe of any kind.That said, the hotel was clean, trendy and in a great location. We were there for 3 nights with not very much luggage so we thought it was great - especially at the price we paid compared to the other hotels in the area. My wife and I are pretty easy travellers, but I think that we would have struggled to be there for more than a few days simply because there was no room.This is an unconventional hotel - if you want style at an affordable price and you plan to be out and about enjoying san francisco this is the place for you. If it is luxury and space you are looking for, pay the extra money and go elsewhere.

<Content>Great location! II stayed at the Mosser while repairs were performed in my house and have to say this small cute Hotel in the heart of San Francisco is the best deal in town for location, comfort and price. I love its modern look combined with classic Victorian architecture. Close to everything, Union Square, cable cars, shopping (is only within steps to the new mall that has Bloomingdale). It's centrally located for transportation to all San Francisco attractions. As usual the place was very clean and the personnel was very pleasant. Parking is very difficult but there is a parking garage near by. There is some noise from the street but you don't hear it unless you open the windows (with all year around cool nights, SF weather helps not to open windows).

<Content>My home away from home This was my 3rd visit to The Mosser Hotel and as usual I loved it. I try to return to San Francisco at least 3 or four times a year and always choose The Mosser. The staff is friendly and the prices are the best in town. The rooms are on the small side but extremely clean and still look like they did after the renovation. The elevator is slow but they said they are replacing it in November. If you are planning a trip to San Francisco you must try out the Mosser they have great prices and close to bus shoppint ( 1/2 block from the new Bloomingdales).

<Content>Awful place - never again I am currently staying here during the Oracle OpenWorld conference. If I could have, I would have left and got another hotel room. My wife was horrified that I picked this hotel. To my defence, it was close to the Moscone center. Problem is, there aren't any rooms in SF to be found.The room is so small the sink from the bathroom is in the room. There are no drawers for clothing, no closet. The bed is horrible.We were actually lucky in the fact we got a private bathroom. There are other rooms with no bathroom. They have to use the public bathroom in the hall.They also charge for internet service. Fortunately, the conference provided internet access, so I didn't have to pay for something that other hotels are providing at no additional cost.

<Content>Small but its all about the area We recently stayed in The Mosser for 5 days in October and were very pleased with our choice after seeing some of the other hotel we could have booked in the loess central locations around San Francisco.The hotel is based in a great location, only a few minutes walk from the vibrate and busy shopping and arts area of Union Square. Nob hill and China Town are in walking distance and trolleys can be picked up only a minutes walk away taking you to Fishermen's Wharf.The staff are pleasant and were helpful in recommending bars and clubs to visit in the area.The rooms are extremley small but modern and the shared bathroom was always free. If you are wanting more luxery than basic you may want to look elsewhere but the location was undeniably the hotels selling point. With some rather more run down and unsafe parts of town only streets away we were happy to compromise on the room size in place of a great location.

<Content>rooms that are tasteful but tiny The Mosser Hotel just south of Market Street has a real sense of style. It's nicely decorated and has some nice extra touches like fluffy robes and cool modern furniture. That being said, the rooms are the smallest I've ever stayed in on this continent. I have seen some of a similar size in Europe, but I can't say I loved staying in them. If you don't spend too much, it's a decent value. (I had a room with my own bath, though the ones with the hall bath seemed fine, too.) The noise is a bit of a problem, though. After having stayed and lived all around Nob Hill and the Union Square area, I've never heard as much noise and ruckus as I did in this hotel - and I was at least 7 floors up! Finally, it would be nice if they at least had coffee or something for guests in the morning. There is a continental breakfast at the restaurant next door, but the price is steep at about $9. I just got a coffee and pastry at a local coffee shop instead. So I'd say pretty good, but not great, in a nutshell.

<Content>Great Value Awesome Location My husband and i stayed at the Mosser this past weekend in September and had a lovely time. We wanted to go cheap so we did the queen with a shared bathroom. If you decide to do this as well, make sure you get a room that is higher in digits (224 as opposed to 201) because the lower the number the closer you are to the stairs which can be noisy. The rooms are clean but small, the staff is friendly and the bathrooms were never occupied when i needed to use it. The location of this hotel is fantastic!!! We didnt rent a car at all and were able to walk to China Town, the shopping district, the museum, clubs etc. Would stay again!!

<Content>Loved The Mosser Small but very well appointed hotel. Very clean hotel with recent remodeling. Stayed there for a weekend get-a-way as a result of the Hotel sending me and email stating reduced rates for specific dates. We love going to SF, so anytime we can go - we go. The location is outstanding! We never had our car brought out from the valet parking. Walked to the Metreon to see The Titianic exhibit which was wonderful. Walked to The Ferry Building one evening to enjoy the boats coming/going out. Walked to the Castro and enjoyed a wonderful meal at Chow on Church. Really loved the location and hotel. Only complaint would be that it was a bit noisy, however this is the City. Only problem with the stay was the valet service. When they did bring our car for check out, the car was a mess. Not sure where they parked it, but it was so dirty and covered in bird droppings. Also, it took over 30 minutes to get the car.

<Content>Excellent location The Pros: The Mosser is conveniently located near shops and restaurants, in addition to bus stops that take you to Fisherman's Wharf and Golden Gate Bridge.  The rooms are clean.The Cons: The rooms are very small. There is no sink in the bathroom (which is mentioned in other peoples' review of The Mossier). The sink is in the corner of the bedroom. The noise level can be a little high at times. We were able to hear other hotel patrons walking in the halls. The bed size seems slightly larger than a full size bed, so if you are use to queen or king size beds, this place is not for you. However, in my opinion the pros outweigh the cons!!! I would definitely stay there again and would recommend people on a budget to stay there as well.

<Content>Loved This Place!!!!!!!! The Mosser is a WONDERFUL hotel! We loved it! It was so close to Fisherman's Wharf and close to great shopping and restaurants! This hotel staff is very friendly and helpful! Our room was small, but it was really cool! We even did the whole share a hall bathroom thing... it was fine and I never had to wait for the bathroom or the shower.... no problem. Also the Mosser hotel gives to their enviromental charity... great place to stay!

<Content>Great Location This hotel has a great location. One block from the rail lines, street cars and cable cars. There are a number of major stores within walking distance for shopping. We were there during the July heat wave with no air conditioning. We had a ceiling fan and the windows did open, but it still got a little warm. The noise from the street was pretty significant (sirens, people laughing, etc.). We had a queen room with a private bath. The description said 120 sq ft and that is what it means! Not much room, but laid out very efficiently!Overall, the experience wasn't too bad. It's a great hotel if you are on a budget and don't mind small rooms.

<Content>Underwhelming, even for the hotel class Stayed here with 2 girlfriends on budgets for the women's marathon which started up the street in union square.The decor is cool, but the room was tiny, and the rollaway bed we paid extra for looked like it had been there since the hotel was built. Pay for an extra room if you're a threesome. The room felt stuffy and a little musty, and since it looked out the the street it was pretty loud until the bars closed. I assume a room on the other side of the hall would be quieter.The fan didn't work, and the nice cozy bedside lights didn't work either. Despite my prompt request, this wasn't resolved by the time we left. The bathroom was okay, but there's no coffee maker in the room, which was problematic for our early wake-up needs. when I inquired at the front desk, the women just shrugged. Then she told me where the starbucks was around the corner. I was expecting a little more hospitality. To that end, the manager at our checkout did refund me the parking and bed rental. He was genuinely bothered that we didn't have a great stay and was embarrassed when I assumed that the hotel had just opened and that was the reason for the bumpy service (it had been open for over a year).A good value for san fran, but not the most comfortable place to rest your head for the two nights we stayed.

<Content>Small but clean and central San Francisco is an expensive city to stay. Knowing this, it is fair to say that the Mosser hotel is good value for money as the rooms are spotless, wel designed and modern. There is also a big ceiling fan (varriable speed) which is really handy to circulate the air in this tiny room! Its location is also very central: litterally 3 seconds walk from the main street with trams to the piers and the Powell line going over the hills! My brother-in-law recommended this hotel and already told us that the rooms were really small, so we knew what to expect. We prefered the shared toilet/bathroom option to save a bit of money, and thought it was a good option as we never met anyone in the corridors and the toilets/bathrooms were really clean and always free! So, in summary, if you don't want backpackers style hotels but don't want to splash out either, I would recommend the Mosser.The only downside, was that we had view onto the back of the hotel where some contruction/building work were going on. Not best for the noise, but that's more bad luck/timing than the hotels fault itself.

<Author>blueberrypie
<Content>good value First I should say I liked staying at the Mosser. It was inexpensive, very clean, fun design and a good value for the area. The shared bath was always clean and I never had to wait for someone else to get out. The bed was confortable and I didn't spend much time in the room so it's small size wasn't a problem. The front desk people were nice and efficient. Staying here made a long trip to San Francisco possible.On the downside - it's an old buidling, the elevator is really slow and there is only one, so if you are on the upper floors it can take a really long time to 'run' back up if you forget something. The windows open, but the restaurant behind the hotel is unudually loud (they seem to do dishes in the alley) so you want to keep them shut. There was a problem with the fire alarm when I was there and it went off early in the morning (twice) so there was a long parade of sleepy, pissed off patrons winding down the unusually narrow staircase - maybe not good if you are claustrophobic.. The sink and mirror set up in the room was really nice, but it icks me out a little that there are no sinks in the toilet room - so you know the previous person didn't wash his/her hands until returning to their own room. Makes me not want to touch the doorknobs. Overall the value is worth the downsides. Armed with some hand sanitzier I'll go back to the Mosser.

<Content>friendly with little rooms Perfect location for downtown shopping and art museums. Bus 30 to Fishermans Wharf and the BART train stop (Powell St.) are within a half block. Nothing fancy and at times the street noise was a bit much, but I adjusted to the small room and the noise after the first night. Exceptionally friendly housekeeping staff. I'll be back.

<Content>What are your expectations? Your enjoyment at The Mosser depends greatly on your expectation. This is not to mean that it must be lowered to appreciate the stay. Know what The Mosser is, and arrive with the knowledge that it isn't a 5-Star modern resort with tile walls and spacious rooms adjoining rooms, nor is it a carbon copy of hotel chains that deliver mundane and mindless comfort. This is a charming little hotel, in every sense of the adjective. The small rooms contain sparten but modern and functional furnitures. The chair in the corner has an artistic swivel table top that you can pull over your lap comfortbly and work on your laptop, using the wireless internet. The lights are modern decor that retains functionality. The beds, although not the kinds you'd find in a mansion, are neat and comfortable. The in-room bathroom is clean and decently lighted, while the hall bathrooms are equally spotless -- the only difference is that they are in the hallway (I had my own in-room bathroom, but also noted that I rarely see the hall bathrooms used; and they're separated by genders with locks).The full-length mirror in my room was useful for me to see how aweful my black linen shirt matched my yellow cargo shorts. The pictures on the wall are deco and the TV, while not once turned on, was installed up on the wall, out of the way yet easy to view. This is the city. And what's more, the Mosser is centrally located in the city. Lots of energy rising from the street below (I had a street-side room), and shopping galore. You'll see people of all type, and at last-call-for-alcohol (if you're up that late) you'll hear some louder people stumbling back to wherever it is they came from, or into cabs. Few and far in between. In other words, it is a busy street that has the sound of any big city. However, the quadruple-pane glass windows are immensely helpful at shutting the world out of your sleep. A great and important value you can't ignore!The restaurant down stairs, Annabelle's Bar and Bistro, serves up a great seared ahi tuna dish that begs you to ask the question, When did I die and go to heaven? One word of advice, avoid the corner room immediately above the restaurant.A few doors down is a great organic coffee shop, walking distance in your flip flops. I love the wine country, adore the beaches, and can't get enough of the islands; but, nothing gives me more energy and excitement than staying in an environment almost entirely man-made. And The Mosser is definitely a great choice to check into. The prices are reasonable and the accomodation is functionally fun and charming. So, know where you're going and set your expectation accordingly. You wouldn't expect an apple to taste like an orange, would you?Regards.[If you have questions that I didn't cover, feel free to contact me: w84all@yahoo.com ]

<Content>Small but cute. In terms of value, The Mosser is a great deal. It's in an attractive building, staff are very friendly and helpful (except for the guy who refused to give me quarters for the laundry because he was running low), and rooms are smartly done. I would not recommend this hotel to people who like large rooms or who are traveling with large amounts of luggage. There is nowhere to put your things. The sink in our room was inside the bedroom, with the toilet and shower in a separate room. A good space saver. But this is definitely the tiniest room I've ever been in in a hotel. Location is great. Nothing much to see in the area, but it's a good central location to get to other neighborhoods. I would stay here again.

<Content>Style and Substance... Convenient, too! I stayed with the folks at the Mosser for almost a week, and they were just wonderful. My friend and I stayed in a king suite with an extra room, and it was perfect for everything we needed as twenty-somethings wanting to see the city. I'd stayed here once before in a smaller room, alone, but both times I was greeted warmly, checked in quickly, and never really had issues with anything else (except the elevator, which has to be a million years old... which is to say, I tolerated the elevator as I tolerate close-talkers and mouth-breathers... you just have to). The first time, the gentleman at the desk (Mark?) gave me some free passes to see the sights so I could get to adventure a little and still stay on budget.SF is a noisy city, so if you aren't used to it, bring your ear plugs. Great access to BART and other public transportation.Love the Mosser.

<Content>Expensive Parking of $28.00 The rooms are very small, the plumbing in my room did not work and the parking was $28.00 in addition to the room cost. Great Restaurant next door.

<Content>perfect location for convention center but no frills Location (5/5): The best thing about this hotel is the proximity to the conference center -- literally a few steps away. It is also very close to Union Square.. If you don't want to spend money on the Sheraton and you want to be next door to the convention center, this is the place to stay.Room and bath (3/5): The room itself is was tiny -- one of the smallest rooms I've ever stayed in (and I've done a lot of traveling in Europe and have stayed in other budget hotels in SF). There was just one hook with a few hangers to hang my clothes. But it was clean. I booked through Orbitz and did get a room with a private bath. The bathroom was clean and functional with a modern shower (enough hot water and reasonable water pressure). Since the weather was perfect when I stayed, I don't know how well the rooms are heated or cooled (but I imagine it could be a problem in extreme temperatures). Amenities(4/5): They do provide basic toiletries like shampoo, soap, lotion, shower cap, etc, which are replaced daily. And there are bathrobes for your use. The elevator is extremely old and slow -- I always used the stairs instead. There was an ironing board in my room as well as a hair dryer. Noise (3/5): Definitely bring earplugs. But that has been true of any hotel I've stayed at in SF. Courtesy (1/5): Needs improvement. For most of my stay they were not especially courteous but also weren't rude. But when I had my wallet stolen (I think I was pickpocketed at the adjacent restaurant -- but I don't blame that on the hotel since hotels and convention centers are often targeted by professionals), they were not very helpful or sympathetic. I was on the verge of tears because I had no money, no credit cards, no ID. But they were too busy doing their usual morning tasks to help me find the nearest police station, to check the restaurant (which is linked to the hotel) to see if my wallet was there, or to help me find useful phone numbers. I understand that they have to tend to other guests, but they could have spared a few minutes to try to help me out. It was one of the most awful experiences of my life and they were totally indifferent to my distress and acted like I didn't exist.Overall: Nonetheless, I would still recommend this as a no frills budget hotel that is extremely convenient to the convention center.

<Content>Excellent Choice! I thought for the amount I paid to stay at The Mosser was great! Its in a ideal location next to the Powell station and in Union Square. We were really centrally located in the city and it was quick to do stuff from that location. The room had a private bathroom, so I can鈥檛 comment on the hall bathrooms. To let you all know its a private shower room that you can lock鈥o that鈥檚 a plus鈥o its not like a gym shower. I had no problem at The Mosser鈥he hotel is like a European hotel. The hotel has been renovated nicely. As a note, if you have never been to NYC and haven鈥檛 heard ambulance sirens and laughter from people on the streets at all times of day then this hotel is probably not for you. This is typical in large cities鈥o if you want quite then go to the Marriot. It was very economical to stay at The Mosser and I suggest it to everyone! I give it a 5!

<Content>Great Place to stay on a budget! I stayed at the Mosser for 3 nights towards the end of April. We arrived to the hotel quite late from the East coast - so we were exhausted. The hotel staff were friendly and accomadating. They provided us with maps - that we used first thing in the morning. The hotel lobby was art deco and the style fit the mood of the hotel. The building is from the 1920's, but recently renovated. This was my budget choice. So we chose a room with a full bed and the bathroom was a shared facility on the floor. The room was tiny... but really all the space you need for a few day stay. The space of the room allowed for the full bed, a sink, small closet, and a little stand in the corner. That's it. But again, very clean and well decorated. A quaint European feel. There were 2 restrooms on the floor and 2 showers. Never had an issue with using any of the facilities. (If I were to do it again - I would chose a room with a bathroom - but I did save a lot of money. )Hotel was in the perfect location. Right off of Market street on 4th. Near public transportation, tons of shopping, and eateries. Only complaint about the stay is that our sink leaked in the room. So we used the trash can to catch the water. Great hotel on a budget. Definately recommendable!

<Content>Small but good value, great location Returned from a five night stay in this hotel last week, and thought I should share the experience. I'd read all the reviews for the Mosser on this site before we went so it was with slight trepidation that we arrived on the Satruday afternoon, exhausted from our flight. The man in reception was firendly and helpful, and provided us with all the info we needed. The reception space is nice enough, nothing to be said about it really. The hotel sits on 4th street just off Market, so is in a great location for shopping, cable cars, nightlife etc. There is a Starbucks across the street, 2 supermarkets within throwing distance, so we got our breakfast from there each day rather than paying the $10 for the continental style buffet that was available - we peeped into the breakfast room one morning and it didn't look that inspiring.The room itself - we had booked a queen deluxe so we could get our own bathroom. Both bedroom and bathroom were tiny, but had pretty much most things that we required. There wasn't really anywhere to store your luggage, and there wasn't a great deal of hanging space but you can live with that for just 5 days. The room was very clean and nicely decorated, except they kept putting a wooden tray on the bed each time the room was made up, with some sort of hideous dusty old fake triffid-type flower in it, which made me shudder each time I put it away. No drink facilities in the room, and there didn't appear to be a room service option. We went to the adjoining bar/restaurant (Annabelles) one night for a beer, and asked if we could take one up to our room - the barlady looked a bit dubious, but said as long as the adjoining door was open, we could cut through to the hotel with our beer. If the door was shut, we'd have to stay in the bar as to walk the 5 yards outside to the hotel with our beer would mean we were breaking some sort of law. Seemed a bit stange, either there is a bar in the hotel, or there isn't, it shouldn't depend on whether a certain internal door is unlocked or not. Anyways, this wasn't really a problem. The hotel was nice, in a good location, clean, friendly staff and good value for money. I looked at the public bathrooms and they all looked clean as well, and I never saw anyone going into them.Only 2 small gripes - one lift, and it took ages for it to get anywhere! We just used the stairs after a while, despite being on 7th floor. I guess it's an old building so not much can be done about this. Also, we were on the side of the hotel that faces the back of a Dennys restaurant, so you get a lot of noise from deliveries from about 4 in the morning. There is also a large building being put up next door to it, and the builders would start at 7 am in the morning or sometimes earlier. So if you want somewhere quiet, bring your ear plugs.

<Content>Awful excuse for a boutique hotel I was appalled when I walked into my room thinking that the Mosser was a boutique hotel. It's essentially an over-styled dorm with mediocre service but a great location. The room is the size of a refridgerator -- you can barely walk the perimeter of the bed without knocking your knees into the walls or the other furniture. We couldn't even open the door fully when we put our little suitcase on the suitcase rack in the only place it would fit. The sink is also in the middle of the room. The bed was uncomfortable, I have never heard so many trash trucks in one night, and the room isn't dark at night -- there is a window above the door that lets a superb amount of light in from the hall all night long. The linens were NOT clean - there was still make up on our bath towels, and the comforter looked so questionable that we threw it on the floor. The elevator is slow and awful - you also get to ride it up and down with their cleaning staff.. meaning the slow ride up is spent with dirty linens. Beware also - we went in the spring and the room was stuffy and hot -- there is NO A/C, just a ceiling fan -- so if you go in the summer and have to prop the window open, you get all the joyful sounds from the street.

<Content>Noisy, bad service, tiny rooms Why oh why did we stay at the Mosser? I had a very grueling day of work ahead of me and needed to get a decent night's sleep. Our stylish, but ridiculously tiny room was on the second floor above the neighboring bar (which is also a part of the Mosser). The loud music was thumping until the wee hours, the raucous crowd was shouting. I went to the nearby Walgreen's, bought some earplugs but it still didn't help. Those low frequency decibels just thump right into your head, through the bed from the bar below.So I called the front desk. It's nidnight and the night clerk is an elderly lady, very disterested in my noise complaint. She says she'll call the bar and tell them to turn it down. Nothing changed. The music thumped on.So I put on my clothes and headed next door. This bar is part of the hotel so you think they'd be considerate of the hotel guests, right? Wrong. The management of the bar couldn't care less. The music thumped on. I was told it wouldn't stop until 2 am. On a Tuesday night!I wouldn't recommend the Mosser for anyone who stays in a hotel for sleep purposes.

<Content>Love the Mosser I brought my sister and her son up to stay in San Francisco on Monday, March 27. We stayed at the Mosser and I just wanted to say how much we enjoyed our stay. I especially wanted to be sure to thank the bellman Mike who was exceptional. I had stayed at the Mosser previously and really enjoyed it. This was the first time for my sister and her son who were there on my recommendation. Everyone at the hotel was very accommodating and my sister and her son really enjoyed themselves, which made me feel good.We also had an excellent dinner downstairs at Annabelle's that evening.Thanks to the Mosser for a wonderful stay.

<Content>Clean and perferct for the Price The prices were amazing at this hotel. Rooms were small but immaculate and decorated in a very European style. Nice touches included very comfortable mattresses, down comforters and pillows. Location is convenient. A few quirks, like a tiny sink located outside the bathroom with a shelf right above so you ended up not being able to lean over it to wash your face. But overall an excellent value, inconveniences were monor. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>The rooms aren't in working order, but the service is sure bad I travel to a lot for work and am always intersted in smaller, boutique type hotels that are a little more interesting than the big chains. Some friends had a show at the Moscone, so I stayed where they were - at the Mosser. What a nightmare. It's cute, I'll give you that, but TINY rooms and service so poor they can't even see sub-standard from where they are. Actually, the bellman was very nice and on it, but everyone else was shockingly disinterested. First, at check-in, the desk clerk was eating dinner. Fair enough - maybe someone didn't show or he couldn't get his break - but he was really unprofessional (stop chewing before you turn around, dude) and it was clear that I was an interruption. Whatever, good help is hard to find, etc., the lobby was cute and I can overlook a little bad service - even bad service from someone with a mouthful who didn't speak maybe three words to me. I get up to the room, and it is cute - TINY but it's downtown SF, right, so no worries there - and there's a tray set on the bed with a flower in a vase. Nice touch, right? Move the tray and there's a hole in the bedspread. Small, but noticeable. Oh, well, it looked very clean - except for the plaster dust under the sink along the baseboard - but I've been sloppy with a vacuum before - so I went to lock the door to take a shower. The lock was broken. The bolt by the handle worked, but the part of the swing lock that is bolted onto the door was snapped off, rending it useless. Great. I set the lower lock and went to adjust the blinds for privacy. The cute wooden venetian blinds didn't work - you couldn't close them. I'm 6'1 so I was able to reach up and close them manually, but it just added to my annoyance. I was late to meet my friends for dinner, so I thought I'd just shower - shower worked fine - and speak to the desk personnel about it when I got back. Dude downstairs was so helpful earlier I doubted he'd be all over this, and there was a scrum at the desk anyway, so I skipped it and headed out. It was late when I got back and so I just went to bed, turned on the TV - and every channel, no matter what, reverted to the menu screen after a few minutes. Maddening. I tried them all... yup, every channel. I turned off the TV, got up to turn on the heater as the blanket and hole-y bedspread were none too thick, and I was hit with an incredible stench of paint from the heating unit. Are you kidding me? I turned off the heater and went to bed. Why not call the desk? Because the night desk person was a woman of a certain age, and I didn't want to get up, get dressed, and ask her to fix the TV, heater, bedspread and lock -- and I wasn't going to pack up and get another room at 1:00 a.m. So, at check-out they made it right, yeah? Hardly. I patiently explained the troubles with the room to the front desk clerk, and he said, and I'm not kidding, Here's your total - $181.26 for the one night. Not Let me see what I can do, not even That's unusual, I've not heard that before not the bare minimum I'm sorry or any acknowledgment that I'd had a crappy stay. Just my total. There's a Marriott across the street and another boutique hotel right on the same block. Stay at one of those. Do NOT stay at the Mosser unless you like awful service, unvacuumed rooms, broken venetian blinds, your clothes to smell like paint the next day, no heat, thin blankets, and a broken lock on your door - all for $181.26 a night.

<Content>Felt like home - Great Hotel, Great Staff. We originally booked for a week but extended and stayed another week having experienced the wonderful staff there. They were attentive, cheerful and nothing was too much trouble. The double room was a little small for us and we were upgraded no problem. The lift was great, fresh fruit at guest reception, room staff were excellent, hotel supports tree planting, historic but modern ... and I cant say enough to thank them for the excelent staff making our stay in San Francisco feel like home.

<Content>Comfortable hotel in a great location This hotel has small rooms but they are adequate. The deluxe rooms with private facilities include a comfortable bed, internet  playstation facilities and a small bathroom. The best thing about this hotel was the location. It is just off Market Street and is only a short walk from Union Square. Transportation around San Francisco is easy with the 'F' streetcar nearby. The station for other streetcars, the BART subway system and several useful bus routes are also nearby. The only bad things I have to say are that the room is small. If you like a larger room, don't stay here. In addition, the lift is pretty slow. But other than that, I had a great stay at this hotel and would definitely stay again - especially as I got a great rate of US$60.00 per night through Hotwire.

<Content>Great Hidden Secret in SF, with state of the art recording studio on site! What a great hotel!.. I recently stayed at The Mosser for a business trip and it was wonderful. The location was perfect for acessing all modes of transportation and Shopping at Union Square. The restaurant on site was delicious and to my surprise packed after work with happy hour business people and dinner meetings. The Staff was helpful and extremley nice. The room was great! Clean and well situated to maximize space. As we all know SF hotels can be pretty small, however with the new design of the Mosser rooms, they definitely nailed on the head with a mondern looking furniture that maximizies the room space.. I was very happy and comfortable in my room for the four day business trip. Noise level was at a minimum (and I was facing the street). In addition they have one of the most amazing state of the art Recording Studios on property. If I were a recording artist this would definitely be a top pick to record a record at...comfortable rooms to stay in, great catered food from there restaurant and stated of the art equipment to record on!... could not find a better deal in the SF area!! definitley a place to stay. I would again!.

<Content>Good place for conferece travel This is a good place to stay, just make sure you know what you're getting. It's more hotel than hostel, but it's not a typical hotel. I stayed at the Mosser while attending a conference at the Moscone center and it was the perfect place for crashing after a long day. For $69/night I reserved a queen-shared room. It was small, but there was plenty of room for me and my stuff. There was a closet and normal hotel things like a TV, ironing board, suitcase stand, hair dryer, little soaps, fluffy towels, lots of pillows, bathrobes and a basket to carry toiletries to the shower. The bathrooms on the hall were 2 separate toilets and one shower room, shared by 8 rooms. It's not locker room style, it's a single bathroom with a door that shuts and locks. The bathrooms were very clean and I never had to wait to use them. My room felt cozy and well kept with newer carpet/fixtures and an overall fun look. The Mosser is close to the Moscone Center and walking distance to Union Square, which was great. The hotel was quiet for the most part. I could hear other people coming in and out of their doors, but they were generally courteous. The only down sides were 1. the elevator is pretty slow 2. the 'queen' bed seems like a full, 3. there wasn't a stereo as advertized 4. you have to pay for wifi access, which I think should be free. Other than that I had a good stay and would recommend it.

<Content>Organic apples were the only good thing I don't know why they make such a big deal about giving the guests organic apples? These cost about $0.97/lb at the grocery store.They should focus on give a CLEAN, decently furnished room. This is where it is lacking.The staff truly didn't care. When we mentioned to the front desk staff that the bedsheets appear not to have been washed prior to stay. They actually grinned and acted like this was a frequent complaint.If the cleanliness had not been a problem, we wouldn't be writing this poor review. However, the room itself was ridiculously small. Even compared to some budget hotels in NYC, our room was SMALL.Do not stay here unless hygiene and space are not important to you. Oh, and the apples are pretty good.

<Content>A 7 out of 10 The hotel itself is quite cute and in a central S.F. location. There is plenty of shopping and eating within walking distance. The rooms are very tiny and the bathrooms are also small. You cannot wash your face in the sink due to the size. As a woman, I may stay here again, but my husband said NO WAY! It is difficult to get to the hotel with the one-way streets. You CANNOT hail a cab though b/c the cab drivers go across the street to the Marriot which is very frustrating. The Mosser doorman tried for 30 minutes to hail us a cab and finally gave up, which tons of cabs were going across the street at the more expensive hotle. We got in the Marriot line to get a cab.

<Content>Good for the Budget Traveler I stayed at the Mosser for 6 nights starting Sept.26. I was in room 806 which gave me a view of a building under construction and required sharing a bath and toilet. I found the room to be very clean but tiny but I came for a meeting and a shopping vacation-who cared about the view.If you have ever stayed in a European B and B (budget level),well, this is the Mosser. It fit my budget and my sense of adventure-besides, Nordstrom's, the Apple store and other great shops are within a 5 block radius.The toilet and shower were immaculate and I never had to wait. I'll stay there on my next trip but in a deluxe room with private bath.

<Content>Good value if prepared September 28, 2005. Five nights. Room 614. Hotels in San Francisco next to the Convention Center can be VERY expensive. This location is a boutique hotel. The rooms are very small. The queen size bed has 3 feet of space along one short length, five feet of space along one long length. A small closet has 10 hangers and that pretty much fills the space. There is a hair dryer, iron, and some bathroom amenities including towels. There is also a sink in the room. Be aware, however, that many floors have about twenty rooms for sleeping, with 2 bathrooms (male, female) and 2 shower rooms along the halls which everyone shares. Interestingly, during the five days we were there, we never had any wait for either shower or toilets. Maybe the floor was not filled, or maybe our early times for showers--around 6:30am--caused that. Wireless Internet connection is fee-for-service. However, one is only a block away from the Metreon, a large entertainment complex which offers completely free high-speed wireless in the area. From HotelKingdom, we got rooms for $80 a night after all taxes and charges. Yes, boutique hotels are probably an acquired taste. Compared to $240 a night across the street at the Marriott, however, it certainly was an equitable trade-off for us. A couple would realistically be the limit--not a location for families by any stretch.

<Content>Be Aware The price of The Mosser was excellent when compared to other hotels and what you would pay if you booked directly through the hotel. Our experience was ok. The rooms are decorated nicely. It's in a great location as far as closeness to cable cars, BART, shopping, etc. However, it's a good place to stay if you're really looking for just a place to lay your head. The rooms are small with not much room for just relaxing. The bathrooms are unbelievably small (the private bathrooms). I couldn't even wash my face in the sink. The shared bathrooms don't even have sinks to wash your hands. Also, in the middle of the night, we were awakened to water running from the ceiling into our tub. It sounded like it was raining in the tub. The lady at the front desk blew us off and made it seem like it was normal by saying maybe someone was taking a bath! We talked with a different person the next morning, but we never heard anything back about it. There wasn't much of a view from our room either. Overall, this experience was just ok, and we probably would not stay there again.

<Content>Noisy We arrived at The Mosser last minute after an unexpected trip to San Francisco. For the price we found the room fine, though small, but you get what you pay for. The location is really good too. However, the major issue with this place was the noise. We had been doing a lot of travelling and hence we needed a good night's sleep. However, on the second night at around 2am, outside the kitchen below, banging and crashing started as some one was obviously cleaning the equipment. We phoned reception to complain and they said that we could move rooms, but we didn't want to move rooms in the middle of the night! We wanted the noise to stop! The noise continued for an hour or so and so we were not happy the next morning with another flight to catch. When we complained at reception the next morning we were told we would not get any sort of discount on the cost because of the noise but that we should leave our name and email address for the manager to contact us. Well we did just that and about 8 months later we haven't heard anything! Is the priority of this place running as a hotel or a restaurant? It obviously can't be both!

<Content>The Mosser Hotel San Francisco鈥擳he worst hotel for its price range? It is possible that there are worse hotels out there yet to be discovered, but the Mosser has to be in the running.I travel to San Fran every week to work, spending a minimum of two nights a week. When I get bored with one hotel, I move on to another. Oh boy, did I make a mistake when I selected the Mosser. The pictures look good, I like boutique properties and the price was consistent. I didn鈥檛 want to know about shared bathrooms so called European style (though being European I sort of question that rather eloquent description). The stay turned into a farce. Let鈥檚 catalog the properties鈥?failings.Check in 鈥?okay. Not exactly friendly but at least quick. It is a totally non-smoking hotel so if you鈥檙e a smoker that鈥檚 all you need to know. If you are not a smoker鈥攖his is the hotel鈥檚 only draw card.One elevator 鈥?period, in fitting with the age of the building. It was not working. In fact, hadn鈥檛 been working for 9 days with no date set for its repair. To quote the sign 鈥溾€he motor is in the shop and we don鈥檛 know when it will be repaired.鈥?The guests therefore are just out of luck.So up the stairs to my sixth floor room. Two flights of steep and narrow stairs to each floor, so that makes twelve flights to the room humping bags. I see now why they don鈥檛 have a gym. They don鈥檛 need to; the stairs are a workout all by themselves.Now to the real gem鈥攖he room!! Tiny would be an understatement. I have traveled to New York, London, Hong Kong etc and this is the smallest room I have ever seen. To give them their dues, on first glance it looks pretty, A designer has tried but...No air conditioning 鈥?fan only. No space to put a bag unless you want to keep stepping over it. No cable to connect to the internet (down 6 floors, back 6 floors to get it鈥攔emember no elevator). $9.95 connection fee too, but with all the other amenities they are showering you with then of course they are justified in charging for the internet (sarcasm). A wacky chair come work-space (remember school desks with swing shelves) that the laptop kept falling off. Wardrobe, well kinda. So small you have to put shirts in diagonally. There is an ironing board though where you would put it when you get it out is a mystery.Nowhere to put any odds and ends (keys phone etc) as the surfaces are to small and sloping so everything falls to the floor.Room too hot with no air con so open the window. Street too noisy to be able to be on phone so... close the window and swelter or open it and put up with the cacophony. Not great options.TV 鈥?trying to be cute they have mounted it to a swing shelf on the bottom of the bed. Guess what Einstein, you kick it in your sleep and it annoying. Plus the screen is so small down at your feet that it isn鈥檛 worth the effort. Oh and to add insult to injury, the remote didn鈥檛 work and I couldn鈥檛 face those stairs again!Let鈥檚 move to the bathroom. So small there is nowhere to stand a razor or toothbrush. The faucet is forced down at such an angle to fit that if you want to swill your mouth you can鈥檛 put it under the faucet. So you end up balancing your toiletry bag on top of the toilet and using each item and putting it back. Not sanitary and not convenient. No plug for the sink.No room service or coffee maker. So if you want coffee when you wake, it is down six floors to a coffee shop and back up six floors. Wow, my legs are aching!Ice machine 鈥?only on the second floor so you better hope you remember to get it on the way up (though they have no ice buckets at the front desk so you鈥檙e going to have to improvise). Otherwise, yes you guessed it, down four floors and up four floors. Well at least I鈥檓 getting my cardio work done on these stairs.As to service, non-existent. Management refused to take calls of complaint though the poor girl on front desk did her best but we all know managers get paid more to deal with the issues. However, they were 鈥渘ot available鈥?to take the calls. How convenient! To top it all, as I am leaving for my office I stop at the front desk to mention the plug and the remote and guess what, they keep the sink plugs at the front desk so you have to take it up yourself. I refused their kind (sic) offer to take the plug with me to the office telling them I鈥檇 stop by tonight. Seriously, save yourself some grief鈥攄on鈥檛 stay there. San Francisco has so many better properties at that price and to be honest cheaper. If someone can beat Mosser as the worst hotel in San Fran, please let me know as I would like to make sure I never, ever stay there.Summary 鈥?I wouldn't stay at The Mosser again if the rooms were free!!

<Content>Excellent value at any cost .../ The Mosser is one of the best kept secrets. I stayed during the week of June 24th and while I had heard about the elevators etc., I was pleasantly surprised. I was travelling alone and had a shared bathroom. I had ample space for my things in the closet. The rooms for singles are not in the most desirable of locations view- wise and I suppose if it had been a priority I would have been displeased. The walls are not paper thin as some have described and I was rarely disturbed by others. As to the elevators, I did not consider them that slow. Regardless, I found it a good opportunity to take the stairs. Location wise you're not going to find a nicer hotel. I was treated very nicely, greeted every morning as I was leaving and so on. I have one caution however, a building is going up behind the hotel and construction begins at 7:00 a.m. However, I was up by then and slept with the windows closed anyways.

<Content>Loved it, will return After reading some of the reviews of the Mosser, I was bit hesitant with my decision. I had chosen the Gay Pride weekend and the hotel was sold out, so I thought I'd have a horrible time waiting to use the restroom and bath. However, NOT A PROBLEM! I had a single room w/shared bathroom- I didn't encounter any problems whenever I needed to visit bathroom or toilet. There are actually two restrooms on each floor: women and men. There was never a line, nor did I have to wait. The location is perfect, close to bus lines, the cable car which takes you to Fisherman's Wharf, the BART, shopping. I will definately stay at the Mosser the next time I go to SF. I loved it. Don't be fooled by negative reviews, the staff was friendly and professional.

<Content>Smallville Yep, very nicely decorated but this does not make up for the size of the rooms - it was ridiculous!!! Would have been OK for a one night stay or something but we had two huge cases which we had to close and stand upright when we weren't using. No major complaints or praises, decent location for the shops and cinema but wouldn't stay there again with a big case.

<Content>Overcharged This hotel is cheap and small. The the majority of the guests that were there on my visit were young and loud. The position of the hotel is near shops but a long way away from any tourist areas of San Francisco.The worst thing was that after I checked out they kept my card on record and charged another guests stay to it! Amazingly they denied all knowledge and never returned my calls. I have been forced to report the incident to my bank as an unlawful transaction.I now await a refund via VISA which will take months. I will never stay at this disorganised, pokey little hotel again! You get what you pay for.

<Content>Great hotel for a quickie weekend stay - no longer! We booked this hotel through a tradeshow website, and got a great deal at $80/night. I was traveling with my husband and infant son. We rejected the first room we were given because we could not set up the crib for lack of room. We eventually ended up with one of the largest rooms on the floor, which luckily had a bay window bump-out that we could use for the crib.While the rooms were very chic and well decorated, I have to agree with other posts that this room, though one of the largest, was WAY TOO SMALL. The bathroom sink was a joke - tucked in the corner with a shelf not 12 inches above, preventing a simple face washing. There were no shelves on which to place any toiletries. One Plus - a GREAT bathtub!Other cons: NO DRESSERS or any type of storage area for clothing. The closet was not even deep enough to hang hangers any way but at an angle, and there was not one single horizontal surface but for a 12 'desk' on the sitting chair. The staff eventually brought us a small 12 table so we could have a surface on which to dry our baby bottles, but otherwise were unresponsive. We eventually went next door to the Container Store to buy a cheap plastic set of drawers so we could unpack.So...while I think this hotel would be fine for quick 1 or 2 night stay, it is definitely not recommended for an extended business trips.

<Content>Small Rooms We stayed at the Mosser in mid-May and the first room we received was extremely small and overlooked the roof of the restaurant next door (Room 216). Because of that, we were unable to leave the window open at night which made the room even smaller, hot and stuffy. This was considered a deluxe room but not in my books. After a day of walking around San Fran, this room was not somewhere we wanted to relax. We were moved to a room higher up (Room 521) which had a bay window and faced the street. This room was what I was expecting. I realize that rooms in the older hotels in San Fran are small but the first room was exceedingly small. The second room was very nice and was comfortable especially after touring the city. The street is noisy but the windows, once closed, do keep the majority of the noise out and the overhead fan keeps the temperature down. The hotel is centrally located to just about everything - trolley cars, cable cars, etc. Nice hotel - just be aware of the size of the rooms.

<Content>Updated Very Well! So is the Mosser a 2 star or a 3 star? I've seen different ratings online. But it's more important to note is that it was super clean and well decorated with simplicity and style.The front desk and valet attendants were always so helpful and friendly; the lobby was beautiful...I wish that I had taken a picture of the wall of coloured glass set in a rich dark wood panels. However, the elevator was slow and always busy... mostly occupied by service attendants trying to go about their work on different floors. Too bad there wasn't another elevator available. (We were on the 8th floor so the stairs were not an option with heavy luggage.)The rooms were small but super clean and efficient...everything had a place to be tucked away. The ceiling fan was much appreciated as there is no air conditioning in this hotel. The lighting was modern and efficient as most were set on minute timers...good idea!We had a shared bathroom but were not inconvenienced at all as there was not a high volume staying on the 8th floor. Great value overall!The location was superb...especially if you are a movie buff - the IMAX Metreon Movie Theatre is just a block away. Annabelle's Bistro, Mel's Diner, Denny's and a liquor/deli store are right around the corner. Powell/Hyde Cable Car is two blocks away. There is so much shopping in the area! Pacific bike shop ($20 for daily rentals) is about 4 blocks away south on 4th. And Pacific Bell Stadium is about 8 to 10 blocks away. I could go on!

<Content>chic boutique hotel I stayed at the Mosser in March 2005 and before that in March 2003. The rooms are very stylishly appointed (modern Euro-style), but be warned that they are small. Also be warned that some rooms do not have their own bathrooms. Depending on the location of your room, there can be some street noise. I knew this before I booked my stays. I was very happy with the room--the layout was excellent and made the most of the small space--and the front desk attendants were also very courteous and professional. I have very much enjoyed the hotel both times I've stayed there and will continue to do so on future trips to San Francisco.

<Content>Good place for budget traveler I'm giving this an Above Average rating, but want to be clear that this is based on it being a good deal for a budget traveler, not as compared to all other hotel options. We just returned from a weekend in SF. I booked a room with shared bath on site59 but was happy to learn we had been upgraded to a DELUXE upon arrival. Now deluxe is an interesting word choice for the rooms, but they were fine. If you basically just want a room to sleep and shower in, this works. It is small so it's not ideal for any kind of relaxing at the end of the day and my husband and I were quite cramped when we were both trying to get dressed at the same time. We were on the 7th floor right by the street and it was LOUD. They must clean the streets every hour in SF. It sounded like industrial dryers and garbage trucks were going at the same time. Surprisingly, the bed was comfortable. And the rooms were clean, with a nice sink, toilet and shower. The night front desk man was not helpful when we asked for a dinner recomendation and actually suggested Denny's when I asked for a place to find steak or seafood for approximately $20/plate. The location was okay, but next time we'll stay closer to the Wharf. It is conveniently located near BART and the streetcar pickups though. I'd recommend this to someone on a budget but would make clear it is just that - a budget hotel, a step up from a hostel, but not quite a super 8. If you are looking for something more akin to a Holiday Inn, you'll be disappointed with the size of the rooms, the elevator and the lack of concierge.

<Content>Exactly what I expected...and that's not a bad thing. I booked a deluxe room which means I had my own bathroom. I spoke with a few travelers that booked on Expedia and they did not know that they would be sharing a floor bathroom. I booked through the hotel with the Bay Cruise Package which meant a cheaper rate on the deluxe room AND 2 free Red and White Cruise tickets. The staff was very helpful in making sure the tickets were waiting for me at the Cruise office. My room was clean and tastefully decorated. It was small, but actually bigger than I expected. I read reviews on here before I left and I've also stayed in a boutique hotel in the same disctrict and it had small rooms as well. I found The Mosser to be an excellent deal for the part of town you're staying in and the amount you're paying for it.The elevator is horrible. It smells and it's terribly slow. My only true complaint directly concerning the hotel. I didn't have any trouble with interior hotel noise. It was the street noise that kept me up all night. I guess you can't really blame that on the hotel. This hotel is great as long as you know what to expect. Do your research!

<Content>A real review of the Mosser Victorian Everytime I check this I keep reading the same reviews of this hotel many times over. They are often upset with the size of the rooms or the bathroom layout and I don't think this hotel is getting the credit it deserves.Last summer I stayed at the Mosser Victorian for five nights in the end of July. I booked the package through Expedia and paid the extra amount for my own private bathroom. Here's the deal, the rooms generally do no come with private bathrooms. This is a small botique hotel that keeps to it's name and has two or three bathrooms on each level. If you want the private bathroom, it is an option and you can pay a bit more for it. Another thing I was reading was the complaints with the room size. This is a botique hotel in the middle of San Francisco. If you're looking for a large room with the most generic and standard hotel room decorations, try a Marriott or Holiday Inn. The Mosser is one of a kind and an amazing hotel at that. You're within blocks of the cable car and subway lines and many other downtown shopping attractions. So if you're looking for something unique and in a great location, The Mosser is sure to suffice your needs. ALSO, Be sure to head up to DOTTIE'S for Breakfast, hands down best breakfast I've ever experienced.

<Content>great price, but you get what you pay for I stayed on a Saturday and Sunday night. I asked for a quiet room, but was told the hotel was sold out in my category and the only room they had left was next to the bathroom. (I checked in at 3pm on Saturday.) The room was also next to the stairs and the elevator, and I heard everyone in the upper floors who walked down the stairs talking, and everyone on my floor waiting for the elevator. The radiator made a knocking sound all night and I could heard everything the couple in the next room were saying. The bathrooms and rooms were very clean, and I never had to wait for either. I never had to wait for the elevator as some of the other reviews mentioned (and supposedly the hotel was full). If you are looking for a very affordable room (using one of the Web-based reservation sites) and can sleep through a tremendous amount of noise, then this is the place for you.

<Content>Not my first choice... The Mosser is a decent hotel for the price but there are other hotels in better locations for the same price. The beds at the Mosser are excellent, but the lack of air conditioning and the strange smells in the hallway make it a less than desirable place.

<Content>Mosser is great I stay here often for business and it is perfect. Clean, cute and centrally located. Better than what I've found in Europe for similar budget hotels with shared baths -- and if you pay a bit more for a private bathroom you get a lot of bang for your buck: bathrobes, toiletries, cable tv, cool decor, video games. If you're squeamish about big city things like street beggars, homeless, crowds and mass transit -- this isn't the location for you. But you'll find the same things at any downtown hotel and pay five times the rate for just a bit more floor space.

<Content>Exactly what I wanted I knew in advance how small the rooms were, and for the price I paid, the location of this hotel was hard to beat.I had an unexpected guest join me, and found that a double room really only *just* accomodated the two of us, but when you are in San Francisco, your hotel room should just be a place to sleep! It filled this purpose very comfortably.The TV worked, the shared bathroom was clean and we never had to wait to use either the restroom or shower. The eco-friendly approach and vision of the Mosser is a definite plus too.Our only gripes would be the noisy kitchen staff at the restaurant below, the slooooooow elevator (the stairs are fine as an alternative though) and that the desk staff couldn't tell us the best way to get to the Haight District. Bring your own map, and ask at the information center around the corner to avoid confusion.Overall, an excellent option for those who want to see the city, but not stay in a hostel. I'll stay there again next visit.

<Content>Brilliant for those on a budget I was really pleased with this hotel. I had a single room with shared facilities, and although quite small, the room was very stylish with some nice touches. It was also very cheap for the location that it was in, and the staff were very professional. The only problem was that the walls were quite thin, so if you are a light sleeper I would give it a miss. If you're young and on a budget, this is perfect. I would stay again.

<Content>Great Stay at the Mosser A girlfriend and I decided to have a weekend getaway in San Francisco. We were on a budget and booked at the Mosser since the price was very inexpensive and it looked like a good choice. The room was very small and we had to share a bathroom and shower. However it was very clean, the staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. We never had to wait for the bathroom or shower.It is in a great area of San Fran, close to transit, shopping and restaurants. It was extremely easy to take the Bart from the airport to the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to friends who are on a budjet.

<Content>Not for me Didn't really like this hotel due to the lack of en suite facilities, however we knew this before checking in. The room we had was very basic, had no safe, was tiny and despite being at the rear of the hotel, were subjected to noise during the night like there were dishes being constantly smashed.The hotel is well situated for Market Street and Powell Street and is fine if you're looking for an economy hotel and economy it certainly is.

<Content>Mosser - just say No Nice lobby, fair-good location, nice pictures on the web site.After that, it was all downhill. This is closer to a student hostel than a hotel. The rooms were described as small but it must be illegal to have a room as small as I had. The room fit the bed and that was about it - this is not some sort of sarcastic exageration.Then the shared bathroom: this had the hygiene of a gas station (and not a very clean one). The floor did not look like it had been cleaned in awhile. It was covered by a grayish color reminiscent of mold. The deodorizer they were using must have had a urine scent to it.Then there are little details like just one slow elevator for a fairly large hotel. Expect a 5-10 minute wait everytime. If you must stay here, try for a low floor so you can take the stairs.

<Content>Schizo Hotel, should be renamed Bates The Mosser should be renamed the Bates Motel because of the strange clientele they had there when I was there.For what you are paying you can get a better deal elsewhere in the city, the lack of air conditioning made the room hot even with the fan on.They are inconsistent with their pricing. I booked in at a certain rate, but when I got there they tried to jump the price on me.I'm not sure how to say this, so I am just going to say it, there was, what appeared to be, a hooker on our floor, she was loud and going at it most of the night. It was awful, she sounded like a cat and I wanted to euthanize her and put her out of her obvious misery from the Toms who were visiting her room. This will probably make some of you laugh, but we had a very early flight out the next morning and we ended up getting no sleep.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised I am from the Bay Area and decided to get away to the city for a short trip. I feel like I have found a new little treasure. I am a single female and felt extremely safe and comfortable at all times. My room was very clean, as were the shared bathrooms. I had booked the reservation the morning of my trip through orbitz and had no problems, as opposed to a previous review. I highly recommend this hotel-it's VERY close to BART, tons of excellent shopping and food. The movie theater is right across the street. I will definitely be staying there the next time I need another short break!

<Content>*very* small and tricked ... We were there at 10/2003. Since the hotel looked stylish we thought lets try one of the cheaper hotels once.We regretted it very much.The first problem was the room size: We booked a room with a bath. The room is exactly as big as the double bed. You can brush your teeth from the bed reaching the wash basin in the corner from there. There was *no* room to open the suitcases, you could barely walk around the bed. The bathroom was exactly as long as the tub + a few centimeters in width in order to get there (the basin was next to the bed since it didnt fit into the bathroom).Ok, the websites told that it was small, so we took it with humor.However, when we came back from shopping on the second day our key cards didnt open the room anymore. When we checked with the reception they told us we were supposed to have checked out already that morning. It turned out that they simply had shortened our reservation for one day. It didnt even help that I had a confirmation from Orbitz since they had me signed a form when we checked in where the shortened stay was stated (and I didnt check it of course since I had the reservation).What I also learned was that I will not book anything over Orbitz anymore, since they were not really helpful although I had a confirmed reservation from them.All in all: dont book this hotel. And dont use Orbitz, they wont help you when they made a mistake.

<Content>Mosser Hotel - A Good Choice Stayed here 3 nights in late July early Aug 04.The hotel is situated in a good location, ie near main streets and transportation.The room i booked (701) came with no private bathroom ( i knew this before i arrived) was of good standard although it was small, but I only slept there - thats all i needed.Shared facilities were close by and were very clean every time i used them and i didnt have to wait to use them.Staff were very efficient and helpfull, I would reccommend this hotel to anyone.The reviews on here were good and bad but a hotel room was just for slleping in and it was ok.

<Content>Marvellous Mosser I was trying my luck when I booked the Mosser online, not knowing what I would get, as the reviews seems to be mixed. Well, it was a really pleasant hotel. The room is SMALL, but very clean, and functional. Same thing for the bathroom and toilet. I was prepared for spartan furnishing, and it was, but there touches of luxury that I didn't even get at 4 star hotel in Las Vegas, such as bathrobes. The only downside is that the walls are thin, and I can hear people moving around on the floor above and outside, plus the fan creaked when it was at speed 2 and 3, but to put things into perspective, it was great bargain at the price I was paying, the location is excellent, the facilities are great  clean. One advise to future guests is to request not to be roomed next to the bathroom and toilet, as this will only add to the noise factor.

<Content>Good but not Great Have you ever noticed a lot of tourists at the Mosser hotel on the weekend? They might be smart to pick that hotel. They are watched on budget and could enjoy the low rate. It needs an additional elevator. This location is convenient and surrounded by many different shoppings and some entertainments. The smell in any room might be offensive and mold.

<Content>A great value for a nice room in a great location. The website was clear about how small the room is. However, the floorplan was well thought-out, making good use of every square inch. There is no AC, and unfortunately my room window was jammed shut. The ceiling fan helped, but it was still a little stuffy. The walls are pretty thin, so I could hear the bathroom fan next door.But the room was clean, and the robe was a touch of luxury. The desk staff was friendly and helpful. I would stay there again for a short visit. It's a great bargain for a great location, close to the Moscone Center, the Metreon, BART and lots of shopping.

<Content>Unique Experience The website advertised accurately therefore we knew we were getting small room and choose the shared bath rate. The hotel is charming and the rooms were beautiful as well as comfortable. The staff was nice, the bathrooms very very clean. This hotel provides an old time San Francisco feel yet the recent renovations provide up to date amenities. All of this AND a GREAT locations with the pleasany city sounds.

<Content>Small, small, small... If you want lots of quaint with teeny-tiny rooms and no air conditioning, this is it. If, however, you are in downtown San Francisco on business, look elsewhere. Not all rooms even have closets! No dresser...drawer under bed. Tiny TV on stand perminantly attached to foot of bed. Similarly tiny bathrooms. Some rooms so small that you'll consider keeping your luggage in the hall. Quirky elevator works sometimes. All this wears quite thin after a weeks' stay. On the plus side, it was clean.

<Content>I thought it was great! Yes, I shared a bathroom. Yes, I waited a few times for the elevator. Yes, this was the most interesting and compact hotel I have ever stayed in. And I would stay there again in a heartbeat. It was close to everything, the staff were great and helped me book several tours. The place was clean and my room was cleaned every time I returned after a day of sightseeing. My room was generally quiet (and I was right beside the toilet room) and I never felt unsafe. If you want a great hotel in San Francisco that is centrall located and has charm, this is the one!

<Content>3 Times a charm 3 Times a Charm!! Posted by psboston7 on I have come to the conclusion that I need to own stock in this company LOL!! This is my 3rd time staying at the Mosser consistent across the board. I must admit this time I did run into some interesting people staying in the hotel and I do think that Young people are staying more because of the affordable rates, but Hey you can't beat this Annabelle's is next door, Movie Theater across the street and Union Square 3 blocks away. My own side note and pet peeve.... They did change their hand lotion and soao from Gilchrist and Soames to some less expensive brand name and I don't like it as much. :(

<Content>Funky room but so small I had to go outside to change my mind. I booked through expedia for a great rate for the Mosser 2 years ago not knowing what to expect but for a fab location downtown. My single with a closet sized private bath looked out toward a brick wall was rather claustraphobic but kept really clean. I liked the modern funky furnishings that were well suited for such a small space. Good lighting to make up for the lack of natural light. I was never able to get the internet/movie services to work. Ice machine 2 floors away was broken my entire 5 day stay. Overall a good 2 star hotel but I would be willing to spend more at another hotel for a more space, better technical services to not return to this hotel.

<Content>Great Place to Stay Walked in off the street with no reservation during a convention, with no good rooms to be had anyplace else nearby, ended up with a room at the Mosser right away. Spent 2 nights in shared bath single and 2 nights in a private bath single. Amenities were as advertized. Both rooms were spotless, with interesting colors and decor you won't find at the likes of a Hyatt or Sheraton (not to knock either of them). Shared bath facilities were clean every time I needed them. Private bath was squeaky-clean. Paint and carpet in lobby, corridors, and rooms were new. Maid service every day; towels, linens and bespreads were clean. Staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms are small but I was very comfortable and did not feel cramped. Don't go in expecting or needing a large table to put the laptop on or tons of extra floor space, and the room size won't be an issue. Good location, close to shopping, SOMA, BART/Muni rail  bus, plenty of taxis to hail. Transportation to SFO a breeze, arranged at the desk. Also right across from the Marriott, so you can point and laugh at all the people who paid three times as much as you did for a bland room with a bigger TV.

<Content>It's ok, but not for the traditionalist Wouldn't you know it, I booked a business trip right in the middle of an Orthopedic Surgeon convention at the Moscone! Well, this was the ONLY hotel in Union Square with reasonable prices and availability. So what the heck, I'll give it a try.The staff was courteous and helpful. Check in and out was a breeze.The room was small...very small. You can stand in the middle of the room and take one step in any direction and literally touch the wall. No A/C, just a ceiling fan that made a creaking noise as it was spinning. It's bad news if weather in the SF area broke a 112 year old record for heat! I suffered through opening the window and turning on the fan, but still I couldn't sleep because of the fan noise, street noise, and heat! Not sure if the previous guess smoked or if there was someone smoking outside, but the room smelled of smoke when I first arrived. It wasn't as strong after a day or two.When the weather cooled down later in the week and I didn't have to use the fan or open the window, the noises in the hallway kept me awake. The noise from my neighbors wasn't the issue which surprised me because of the size of my room. It was the noise from the hallway that kept me awake! Doors slamming and ice machine dispensing noises were coming through the paper thin door.My little 13 TV mounted on the wall had a problem with the video and sound cutting out during my stay. It's a little annoying when you're watching movie! It was also a little out of focus and too small for my liking. But the radio worked well.The shared, separate M/F bathrooms and toilets seemed clean enough..at least the Men's were. I could imaging that it would be a little tight for a large person to get into the toilet room. I'm medium build and I had to do a little dance to get the door closed. The hotel supplied bathrobes you could wear, but a pair of slippers would be a nice touch.The elevator was a little slow if you're in a hurry.It is my opinion that this hotel is more suited for the business traveler that just wants a room and clean sheets, than families with kids.

<Content>Cute little rooms I stayed in a deluxe twin room on a recent business trip (02/29/04), and was pleasantly surprised. The accomodations are pleasantly decorated and very clean. The rooms are pretty tiny, but the overall charm of the place makes up for that. The Mosser is also within a few blocks of the Moscone Convention Center which made getting around on foot fairly convenient for me. I would recommend this hotel to other business travelers, singles, or students... it's a bit too small for family travel though.

<Content>Small but charming rooms If you're looking for your usual big American hotel room, the Mosser is not for you. Yet if space isn't as big a deal as charm, this is a pretty good find. The rooms are small, but they have done a good job of adding modern conveniences to old-style hotel rooms. It's right off of Market Street, near Union Square, so it's in the heart of everything. We spent two days there and enjoyed it.

<Content>more than met expectations Thoroughly enjoyed my room and stay at the Mosser in mid January 2004. Quality equipment - it all worked. Sure, my room was small, but for the bargain rate it was A-OK. They more than lived up to the advertised specials. A $7.00 bkfst with excellent coffee, fresh orange juice, scones, muffins, fresh fruit! The happy hour in lounge was good, too. Nice drinks, and the restaurant served up a superb cioppino at the bar! The desk staff helped me catch the right transportation, not what I was going to do. And, then, when I got back later that day, they asked if my trip went smoothly! Needed e-mail, they called Marriott across street to find out if I could use their biz ctr. The staffer told me where it was and how much it would be. Again, very nice. I'd stay there again, at twice the price.
