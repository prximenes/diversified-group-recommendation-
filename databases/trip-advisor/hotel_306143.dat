<Content>Upgraded to Executive! i stayed at this hotel from 26th to 28th dec. i paid sgd268++ for 2 nights under promotion 2 nights singapore delights. i booked 2 rooms. i arrived at around 130pm and i requested for 2 twin beds room and connecting rooms upon check-in. however connecting rooms are unavailable. the 2 rooms were upgraded to executive rooms at the 9th floor WITHOUT extra charge, but on the smooking floor. since we're all not smoking, i requested to check the room first. the receptionist allowed. the smell was OK, not too bad. we accepted the rooms. only 1 room was available upon check-in and the receptionist asked for cleaning for another room. we didn't mind since we're all going out for shopping.the only problem was the car park. my brother took out the car while i checked-out. the problem was we're not given the complimentary parking ticket coupon upon check-in and it's only issued upon check-out (i didn't ask either upon check-in). he was stucked at the parking barrier and pressed the help button continuously but no one answered. after few minutes of waiting then the barrier was open. you should ask about the parking ticket coupen upon check-in.i found the location was good. it took about 5 minutes only to orchard road. the walk could be tiring upon going back to hotel since the road inclines. we took taxis after shopping.the rooms were clean. no trouble with any of the rooms. maybe it's because we're on the executive floors. the service was good. we called few times regarding the lights in the room. thought that it was not working. the reception sent poeple in to have a look but it turned out to be that the button on the bedside table was not pressed. we didn't have any breakfast/meals inside the hotel. so no comment about it. rooms are quite big.honestly i was scared after reading reviews here. i was about to change hotel, but i didn;t. lucky me! it turned out well... i am satisfied!

<Content>Terrible, Terrible, Terrible During our business stay, we moved to 3 different rooms before finally finding another hotel in Singapore. Our story seems to have been quite common for guests at this hotel. The first room was the size of a tiny box, I think they put everyone there first, just to see who will actually stay . The ceiling in the bathroom fell thru one night when it rained, and the floor was covered with water and some black stuff like mold or something, and the third room smelled so bad that we just gave it up! Some say that patients from the hospital down the street stay there too, and some said the smell was ether, who knows. The management there could care less, their solution to any problem that you had was to simply move you to another empty room. That is if they ever bothered to answer the phone. Normally, you would just have to go to the front desk. One morning, I returned from breakfast to find my door left open by maybe housekeeping, the manager stood there looking at me, trying to understand why that would be upseting to a guest. I actually saw a staff member walking down the hall with a bundle of inscense, probabally trying to hide the smell there. When they saw me, they began to run down the hall, pretty sceary. Then there was the housekeeper that insisted that he remembered me from the time before when I was sick..... And last but not least, dont count on the internet working alot there either.

<Content>Great Hotel for Tourist Located only about a few kilometers from Singapore's famous shopping area, Orchard Road, The Elizabeth is very convinient for tourists. We stayed at the hotel during the first Singapore Formula 1 nightrace. It only takes us a few minutes to go to the F1 circuit.Although is an old Hotel, it still very well maintained and very clean. The room is just right for couples butit would be too small for travellers with children.We were travelling there during the months of Ramadan. But unfortunately the hotel does not provide early breakfast for their muslim guests. Not even coffee or tea with sandwitch or muffin which in some hotels in Singapore usually provided for guests who is taking a very early flights.But fortunately there is a nearby mosque, Al-Falah which conduct a night prayers and provide a free breakfast.The overall service is very good and the staff is also very friendly. They also dressed up in sport shirt and caps during the race events.

<Content>Total Mistake I am a little surprised at the good reviews that this hotel has received. The Elizabeth hotel, considering the price, is overly priced for what it is and a huge disappointment.Negatives: - Nobody helped us bring our luggage to our room. - When we got to our room there was sand and wet towels all over the bed, sandals in the bin and the bathroom was wet. They gave us a room that wasn鈥檛 even cleaned. - Hotel staff are not very friendly though they are quite efficient and polite.- Construction is nearby and it is noisy by 8am- We stayed at an executive suite, however, the room was very small, dated and drab. I hate to think what a standard room is like.- Even though it is just off Orchard Road, you need to walk up a hill (in the humidity) to get to the hotel.- The air-conditioning doesn鈥檛 work properly and you can not set the settings. The room was so cold; I got sick on the way to Hong Kong.I am not sure why this hotel is considered a four star hotel which charges around $250 (AUD) per night. I have stayed at cheaper hotels in Singapore which is of better quality.The only good thing about this hotel is the Italian Restaurant on the ground floor. It is quite nice and the staff are vey friendly.

<Content>Excellent location and experience My wife and I with 15 y/o son stayed 4 nights. No problems from check in to check out. Courteous staff, great breakfast and service. Location was only a few minutes walk to Orchard road, exactly where I wanted to be. Would definately stay there again . Great swimming pool, gift shop, and internet for 1 Singapore dollar for 10 minutes.

<Content>Not worth the money Knowing that Singapore is an expensive city, I didn't expect this hotel to be immaculate. However, it is not worth the money at all. We stayed in an executive room that included free mini-bar and free wireless internet. The internet option was nice, but the room was tiny and the carpet did not look very clean. If this hotel cost US$100 or less then it would be average. The worst part was that there was construction in the hotel on the floor above our room! The loud noises woke us up at 9am and went on until 6pm. When I called the front desk, they told me that it was the construction on the hotel next door (which apparently affects some other rooms), but they didn't confirm the construction in their hotel until I specifically asked about it. I did not see the pool or the gym so I cannot comment on them. I do not recommend the buffet breakfast- it was included for us but it is not very good at all. On the positive side, the employees at the hotel are nice and the taxi service is helpful. The location is only a ten minute walk from Orchard Rd and no cab drivers seemed to have trouble finding the hotel.

<Content>Good 4 star hotel Stayed here over an Aussie long weekend in March this year, for 7 nights. 4 of us had 2 rooms, a double and a twin. Overall a good experience and pretty good value. The location was great, being a cheap hotel only 5 minutes walk from the main part of Orchard Rd (between Paragon and Lucky Plaza). While other cheap hotels might be on Orchard, they generally have a longer walk to get to the big malls and the most modern part of Orchard/Scotts.The hotel is small, and over the road from the York, another 4 star. The Elizabeth is slightly better however and if the prices were the same or very close I would rather stay at the Elizabeth.The rooms were small but comfortable for the price and the bathrooms were quite small with a combined showerbath. The bed was comfortable but again nothing special. Just a 'normal' room with a 'normal' bed, minibar, tv and safe.We didn't eat at the hotel, but nearby are the 'touristy' food outlets in lucky plaza. These are clean and cheap (4-6SGD a dish) and excellent, but still pricey by local standards. The other nearby malls have nicer restaurants so there is no shortage of good food, or shopping.The staff are helpful and friendly and the pool was average.All up a good 4star that I would not hesitate to stay in again if I wanted a cheap hotel with a good location.

<Content>Stay away... Terrible Hotel 2 Nights stay at the the Elizabeth Hotel, being a regular traveller to Singapore we recently stayed at the Elizabeth Hotel鈥?Stay away, this hotel is one of the worst I have stayed at in Singapore it was $210AUD which is not cheap, the rooms are small, they smell  the hotel is old.. Because the room was so bad we where going to check out, because we booked directly with the hotel, they would not refund, so we had to stay, we had to pay an extra SIN$75.00 for a room that was better鈥?It was not much better !!!!Stay at The York across the road same price  far better service, rooms  overall experience better鈥?/p>

<Content>very good value for money Having stayed at many 5 star hotels in Singapore and going now for just a quick weekend we thought we'd go down market so to speak (pardon the incredible arrogance here) and book a 4 star hotel for a change. If it's taught me anything it's that we've been overspending on our past trips to Singapore as I didn't really miss anything we would have had in the other hotels. The service was good, the people friendly, rooms well-appointed and clean and we had a really nice relaxed time. It doesn't quite have the luxurious opulent feeling of a Shangri-La or Raffles of course, but it's very good value for money and we would come back next time - and spend the savings on shopping or food!!Breakfast was nice, if a bit on the basic side variety-wise. The restaurant staff were very friendly and extremely helpful with the kids. We didn't have any other meals at Modesto's (the Italian restaurant where breakfast is served as well) apart from some kids dinners and they were very good, as was the room service tomato  mozzarella salad and chicken dish that we had. There is also a pub next to the pool and drinks/snacks are served at the pool (small but nice enough with plenty of loungers around it)The location is very convenient, a 5 min walk from Orchard Road and the Mount Elizabeth Hospital is on the way there - very handy for us as one of our kids always seems to end up sick on our travels!

<Content>Pleasantly surprised We stayed at the Elizabeth Hotel on our way back to New York from a two week trip through Thailand and Cambodia.I was actually pleasantly surprised by how comfortable the hotel was. Yes, it is a bit of an early- to mid-80's time warp (70's is an exaggeration). However, the room was well-sized, well-appointed and meticulously clean. Personally, I didn't think it was in dire need of an update like some have suggested nor did we hear any noise. Check-in was a breeze and the concierge was very helpful in helping us contact a friend in Singapore for dinner. A small problem with our room was resolved almost instantly. Since our rate didn't include breakfast, we can't comment on it.One thing to note is that the hotel is a bit of a hike uphill from the Orchard Road shopping district and a 15-minute walk to the Orchard MRT station. If you are taking taxis everywhere, this is irrelevant but you should bear this in mind if you need to stay on Orchard Road (i.e., stay at Regent, Hilton or Marriott). This is probably why the hotel is lower priced than its nearby competition.Overall, a good experience.

<Content>The Elizabeth - Great Value Recently my wife and I together with our adult son returned from one week at The Elizabeth Hotel in Singapore. Our son uses a wheel chair at all times and we experienced some difficulty in finding an hotel that offered 'accessible' facilities. We were reluctant to reserve the two rooms at The Elizabeth (one accessible and one standard) after reading the numerous Trip Advisor reviews..frankly we were nervous!The hotel turned out to be perfect in every way, the rooms the staff, the buffet breakfast etc. In staff in particular were very helpful and at all times went out of there way to make our stay comfortable and pleasant. We were warned about the construction next door which does creat noise in the pool area but only during the day. The whole experience was excellent and we could not understand the negative reviews. The hotel is an easy stroll to Orchard Road but far enough away to be less crowded. The Elizabeth is not the Ritz however we thought it was excellent value. We would suggest you request a NON SMOKING LEVEL on the side away from the construction site.

<Content>Welcome to the 1970s I stayed at The Elizabeth last weekend and felt I was in a time warp back in the 1970s. Decor badly in need of an update, right down to the (rusting) bottle cap opener screwed to the bathroom cabinet and the non-functional radio in the bedroom night table. IT was less than groovy however, becasue I ended up paying over $150 for a very basic room. I know accommodations in Singapore have got very pricey, but this was not good value for the money - even after I requested and received a change to a supposedly renovated room. A better bet would be to stay at the YMCA.

<Content>Good hotel, decent surrounding area I stayed here for work recently and was pleasantly surprised by the Elizabeth. The beds were comfy, the amenities were good, and the water pressure in the shower was tremendous. Good enough to mention online? Yep. I only tried the restaurant downstairs for breakfast, and because it was free (since we got vouchers). Otherwise I wouldn't suggest eating it. It's a relatively short walk to Orchard Road, and all the shopping contained therein. It's easy to get a cab and about 5 minutes away from the Orchard Road MRT station, so getting around from this hotel is very simple. Overall, I would recommend it if you can afford it.

<Content>Noisy and needs updating The Elizabeth is moderately priced for its location and the staff are very helpful, but the decor is very gloomy and desperately needs updating. Also, the building next door is being demolished extremely noisily. The work starts promptly at 8am so there is no chance of a lie-in.

<Content>Hotel good despite building site next door! We stayed at the Elizabeth for three nights as a stopover from New Zealand. Our initial thoughts were 'oh dear - next to a building site!' But truthfully unless you were stood outside the hotel during the day, you didn't notice the building site. On entry to the foyer the hotel looked great. Lots of marble and smart looking counter staff. However the hotel was looking a bit jaded round the edges. Our room was quite dark even with all the lights on. But the bedding was spotless and the room was cleaned daily. We had breakfast a couple of days but it wasn't cheap and some of the concoctions were strange to say the least (chicken porridge?) - however we were in a foreign country so we realised that things would be different to what we were used to. Orchard Road shopping area was very close and we were able to walk there in five minutes, (two minutes at a dash when it was raining!).All in all not a bad place to stay for a short break.

<Content>Good Hotel I stayed at the Elizabeth while on business in Singapore. I was relatively happy with the quality of my room although the bathroom was a little on the small size. The hotel also needs to spend some money on upgrades as there were a few scuff marks and peeling paint visible in the room and reception area.The breakfast buffet wasn't bad although I have better in other hotels.The Elizabeth is located abou a 5 minute walk from Orchard Road which is great.Overall I would probably stay at this hotel again.

<Content>good location If you are looking for somewhere to lay your head and that is all then this is a good hotel. We stayed here three nights and only spent enough time in hotel to sleep and shower. The hotel is average nothing spectacular, but the location is great especially for the price. The hotel is just a very short walk to Orchard rd. and a short cab ride to places like Clarke Quay and Little India. I would recommend this hotel if you are on a budget and looking for a good location near Orchard rd.

<Content>Adequate The Elizabeth is a decent hotel. Which is unfortunate because I believe that it was probably a very nice hotel about 5-7 years ago.The rooms are decently appointed but it is time that the company reinvest some money into the place. There are scuff marks on the paint, doors and gouges out of the wallpaper in the hallways. My shower had mold in the grout and in the corners of the tub and on the floor. It was nothing terrible but it was noticeable.The hotel is one of the cheaper hotels in Singapore and it's a good thing because it is not up to par with other properties in the city.The service was adequate, friendly and fairly efficient.The hotel is owned by the same group that owns the Orchard Parade hotel. I have stayed at the Orchard Parade on four separate occasions 98, 00, 02, and 04. During that time I watched that hotel go from very nice place to a place that needed some serious attention. Given the similarity between the properties, I believe that the corporate management is probably to blame for the neglect of both properties.

<Content>Would not recommend this hotel I stayed here for a week in September. Location-wise, it isn't really a short hop and step to Orchard Road. The hotel is located up a hill, and though not too tedious a walk, it can get rather sweaty in the humidity of Singapore. We had a car with us and had complimentary parking in a dank narrow underground hotel car park which just didn't feel secure at all. The lobby was tiny and the wait for service was lengthy. The room itself was cramped and dated, with windows facing a neighbouring sterile condiminium complex. The bathroom was not at all impressive, and construction began early in the morning, waking us every day. The biggest problem with our stay was the hotel's lack of honesty in relation to our safe deposit box. It wasn't working from the outset, and when queried, they sent a technician up who said it'd be fixed within the day. This carried on for 4 further days and we had to constantly remind them each day. Finally, they told us it wouldn't be fixed for the duration of our stay. Only when I complained did they offer me another room, which I felt they should have done from the outset. I wouldn't return again. There are much better hotels out there for the same price.

<Content>Misleading... After looking at the hotel website I was lead to believe that the hotel was the perfect choice. However once I arrived I was surprised at how small the hotel really was. The lobby was just a 'waiting room' with only 4 seating spots...so most people would be standing around waiting with nowhere to sit. It seems the photos showed what looked to be a more newly renovated standard room than the one I had been given. The room felt small and the single beds were ridiculously undersized. The breakfast was average but with a fairly decent variety. The atmosphere of the restaurant was a little dated...It seemed we were back in the 80's and by the looks of things it probably hadn't been renovated since then. One good thing to say about the hotel is its location with shopping centres such as the 'Paragon' in easy walking distance. Overall the hotel isn't nececerilly a disasterous but i'd only recommend the hotel to short term staying.

<Content>Not that great The location was great, only a couple of minutes walk into Orchard Rd.We were travelling with a 4 year old. When we booked we were told the beds were queen size but upon arriving we were given the choice of a double or 2 singles. We took the double but found it too small for the 3 of us.Rang reception to see if I could get some linen so one of us could sleep on the floor ,we were sent 1 sheet and a dirty threadbare blanket.The rooms were quite dark and small.Reception staff not very friendly at all. Breakfast in comparison to what we had had in other motels on our trip was disappointing. Staff however were friendly and the coffee was great.

<Content>All that you need Just returned from a short break in Singapore and spent another enjoyable week at The Elizabeth. OK it's at the top of the hill but who's that lazy that they can't walk the short distance to Orchard and the MRT. Breakfast was lovely - plenty to choose from and staff very friendly. Always enjoy the swimming pool after doing the rounds of the shops and there's a gym if you're especially keen on exercising!!! The bedrooms are adequately furnished and well maintained - no fusty smells - and the bathrooms tiled in black, white and brown. We have never had any problems with the staff at this hotel and have thoroughly enjoyed all three stays.

<Content>to be avoided Even though it was only 8.30pm no one to help carry bags to my room.Room was small, smelt mouldy,and the hand basin had an 8 inch crack in it.At 10.30pm ordered a meal from the inhouse restaurant - we were asked to eat outside, beside the pool. At 11pm the staff turned out all the lights and left! So forced to eat in the dark.Upon leaving had to ask reception three times for the bell captain. The reception area itself is small, with only four chairs.So chances are you'll be standing if waiting for a taxi,etc.Be warned the location of this hotel isn't the greatest. Uphill for three hundred metres from Orchard road, along a busy road with a narrow foot path.

<Content>A Disappointing Stay We booked the Elizabeth Hotel via Expedia and checked in on Sunday 8th April 07. There was extensive building work taking place immediately next door to the hotel and so we asked for a quiet room away from the building work. The hotel said it did not have a double or queen bed avaiable on a non-smoking floor and so we were allocated an extremely small twin for our first night's stay. We changed room the next day and whilst it was slightly larger and more comfortable, it was right next to the customer lifts and there was constant machine noise throughout the evening and night. The buffet breakfast was probably the worst we have experienced in terms of food choice and quality, and the surroundings were drab and uninspired. We were similarly disappointed when we ordered room service - our order was delivered 20 mins late, we didn't receive what we'd asked for, the portions were small and the food flavours were over-powering (garlic dressing on caesar salad). The hotel is in need of rennovation. For example the painted finish of the baths in both rooms were flaking to a significant extent and the over-bath shower heads were immovable and sprayed water all over the edge of the bath and the toilet when turned on.We decided to check out after three nights of a planned four night stay, and my partner rang reception to check whether there would be any penalty charges for leaving a day early. He was told that there would not be any charges, so we packed and went downstairs an hour later to check out. We were then told by staff that we would incur the full charge for our fourth night. We challenged this and spoke to John Yap, the hotel's Guest Service Manager. He listened to our comments and after some initial reluctance agreed to advise Expedia that the hotel would not be requesting payment for the fourth night and would ask them to refund us the charge (it had been prepaid at time of booking). Mr Yap was both patient and polite and his attempt at service recovery was the only positive experience during our stay at the Elizabeth Hotel.

<Content>Don't stay there! Stayed for 4 nights at The Elizabeth. It was a mistake.The location is OK, but not as good as others write. A 10 minute walk to the nearest shop is too far in Singapore! The room was dirty. Dust everywhere. And we found blood (?) stains on the bed sheets. (twice)There are building works next door (at least until late 2008) with lots of noise. We woke up early every day we were there. Had a drink at the pool and paid $11 for an orange juice. A rip-off.Don't stay at The Elizabeth. There are far better hotels in Singapore for less money.

<Content>Good location but rooms badly need refurbishing This hotel is near enough to Orchard road but not right on it so it is more quiet and feels more neighbourhoody, which is great. 3 minutes walk to the main part of Orchard road and MRT station. Sadly,that's where good things about this hotel stops. I had booked a non smoking room with one queen bed so I was not pleased to walk into a room that smelled of stale cigarettes with 2 twin beds. The room was very old, furniture looked like it was from the late 70s, TV didn't look much newer. But it was super small though, maybe that was supposed to be modern back when they got it in the 80s. I requested for a room change and they said yes they will be right up. I finally got it after falling asleep for a couple of hours waiting for them, literally, no kidding.The non smoking room I got was even smaller than the first one. Can't say I like the linen in this hotel. Duvet was very thin and bed was not very comfortable. Of course I would not be complaining about most of this had I not been expecting a 4 star hotel like expedia said it is, and had I not paid the price I paid. My Singaporean friends all said that I had been majorly overpaying and that if I wanted to, I could've stayed at the all newly renovated York Hotel right across the street for the same price or less.It's a shame that they had let the hotel get this old inside, given they are in a very good location and could do so much better.

<Content>Very acceptable and friendly choice We stayed at the Elizabeth for three nights. Despite the other reviews which might scare you off, we found the staff friendly and very responsive, room was clean and in good shape, and only a few very minor issues. Whenever we called, someone was at our door in 5 minutes or less (e.g. extra blankets and pillows). This hotel is conveniently located to Orchard Road and Mt. Elizabeth Hospital and reasonably priced for Singapore. About the only drawback is that the bathtub was difficult to access for a senior---though there were plenty of grab bars.

<Content>What a let-down!!! The Elizabeth proved to be the complete opposite to what Singapore is all about. It lacked the sophistication  modernity of the country  instead was dark  very depressing indeed. Luckily the fabulous Orchard Road was only 10mins walk so we didn't have to spend much time in this awful hotel that seems to be stuck in a time warp.

<Content>overall good value I stayed in the Elizabeth for 2 days. Pro麓s: It麓s a quite nice hotel. Clean room (liitle small, but thats common in Singapore as I have read in many reviews) and friendly staff. It麓s near the Orchard road, the no.1 shopping -street. The famous japanese Ngee Ann City is just across the street on Orchard road. Near means, you have to walk up the mount elizabeth for 5 minutes, but don麓t be afraid: it麓s just a hill! There is also the MRT nearby. Con麓s: I booked a non-smoker-room, but got a room on a smoker-floor - wasn麓t too bad, but still: if you are sensitive to that it might be a problem. secondly: the breakfast: expensive (not included) and not of a good quality.Overall it was a good stay and worth the money.

<Content>Great location Great location. Easy walking distance to Orchard Road, the main shopping area. Rooms somewhat small but comfortable. Beware checking-in before at 14.00. We arrived at 02.00 and were charged for an extra day. Breakfast selection average and not very good value. If possible, stay over Christmas, the Xmas illuminations in Singapore are magnificent.

<Content>Sour Singapore The Elizabeth Hotel failed to provide the room we had booked. I must state that my wife and myself were happy with the transfers to and from the airport as well as the breakfast provided by the Hotel, however the rooms that we had booked and paid for (to the travel agent) at the end of May 2006 did not align with the room we were given. When we arrived at the hotel we were directed to our room however when we entered the room we discovered that the room had not been serviced after the previous guests had left - there were towels strewn around the room and the bed sheets had not been replaced. We immediately went to the foyer and informed staff of the condition of the room. I also mentioned that we required a non smoking room and were informed that one was not available. After checking their available rooms, my wife and I were offered a non smoking room with three single beds with the promise that a room with a queen size bed would be available the following day. I reluctantly agreed to this as we had just flown from Paris via Heathrow and was extremely tired. The following day after sightseeing and shopping we returned to the Hotel (around 6.00pm) expecting to have been transferred to a non smoking room with a queen size bed as promised. However, we were only offered a non smoking room with two single beds and were required to wait for over an hour for this room to be serviced (with the compensation of a soft drink). We found during the night that the adjacent room (there was a locked door between our room and the adjacent room) was occupied by smokers and the strong smell of cigarette smoke was coming under the door into the room thus compounding our problems. Our treatment by the Hotel in Singapore has left us with feelings of discontent and we would not consider staying at the Elizabeth Hotel in the future.

<Content>Could do better... Stayed here half-board only in February 2005. This was my first time in Singapore and will most likely be my last, no doubt not helped by below average hotel. It is fairly modern and reasonably clean but my room stunk of cigarettes and was cold during the night 鈥?I could not turn the air-con down!Breakfast was OK but I never had dinner or lunch and vegetarian options are limited. The restaurant staff were quite friendly but the front desk staff where downright rude!The other comments here echo my sentiments.

<Content>so average We stayed at this hotel for a week when my son needed emergency medical care in singapore. We needed two connecting rooms. Both smelled so strongly of cigarettes that it was difficult to stay there. To mask the smell, strong room deoderant was sprayed every time the room was cleaned. It is hard to say which was worse.My room service experience was dismal both times. The first evening, half the food arrived and not as I had requested it. The second evening it didn't come at all. When I called down to check on it, they obviously rushed the order because it wasn't fully cooked, and again, not entirely as I had ordered it. I gave up after that.The rooms, in short, are dismal and tired and need serious refurbishment.On the upside, it is one of the cheaper hotels in Singapore and is close to Orchard road and other main attractions. The employees at the front desk were friendly and the bell hops were very helpful.Other than that, not at all exciting.

<Content>There are better places to stay in Singapore Although not terrible, there are a lot better hotels for the same price to stay in in Singapore. The hotel room was very dated and not as clean as it could have been. There was a patch of damp in the bathroom too - in it's time this was probably a nice hotel, it's just a shame it's time was about 30 years ago!!The location too could pose a problem for some people. It is a 15 minute hilly walk to the main Orchard Road area and the nearest MRT station. Although this may not seem far, in the heat and humidity of Singapore it is a very hot and sweaty experience.I have stayed in Singapore 3 times now and this was by far the worst hotel I have stayed in. The Orchard Parade hotel and the Phoenix (no swimming pool) were a much better class of hotel and far better located. There are some alterations going on at the Elizabeth at the moment - maybe it will be better then, but for now I would choose somewhere else.

<Author>travelleraust
<Content>worse than the reviews!!! I must admit I felt very worried after having read the mixed reviews but I approached the hotel with an open mind. Firstly I had to wait a very long time at reception waiting to be served. As I opened the door to my room the first thing I noticed was the dirty fingerprints all over the mirror on the outside of the bathroom door. The room was very dark. They were crumbs by the kettle and coffee area. I walked into the bathroom and noticed hairs in the sink and the bath and on the floor. Lifting the toilet seat, I saw that it was dirty and the toilet bowl was also dirty. There was also a few hairs on the pillows. I was totally disgustedI immediately called reception and asked for another room. They told me they were fully booked and they would do the best they could. In the meanwhile the housekeeper came up and I showed her the dirty bathroom, she said she would find another room.After waiting 1 long hr, they said they had prepared another room - it was the next door room!!! It was nearly just as dirty. I gave up and left the hotel. I tried to get some compensation but they were not forthcoming. They were most unhelpful at the reception desk. NEVER AGAIN. p.s I went then to the regents hotel and it was fabulous.It does not pay to get a cheap place, this hotel was more like a 3 star hotel and definately not 4 star.

<Content>Beautiful rooms, nice hotel I stayed here as part of a business trip. I thought the hotel was well appointed inside and looked like a spa of sorts. The rooms were very nice, bathrooms were elegant with marble countertops, and all the amenities provided. I thought the location was a bit isolating, (I spent the personal time of this trip at the Golden Landmark a bit south of this hotel and found it much better for tourist activities) although the whole long strip of malls was only 2-3 blocks away. The bar was very loud, even when empty, and the drinks were stunningly small and over priced. $11 for 30 mL of Jack Daniels. All in all, I thought this hotel was nice and suited the business needs quite well.

<Content>Let down at the Elizabeth Our family did a 5 day stopover at the Elizabeth, I found the service very poor, on arrival, they nearly checked us into the wrong rooms (with the same surname). Despite having breakfast vouchers from our travel agent, they refused to accept them and stated that when our room was booked it did not state breakfast, so we had to pay for our breakfasts and seek reimbursement from the agents on our return. And to top it off they lost my pajamas!. My white pajamas were left on top of my bed when I returned to my room after breakfast our bed had been made up and I only discovered the loss when I needed them at night. I reported it to reception who appeared uninterested and said they would report it. I never did get my pajamas back. I would not have minded so much if at any point I got any apology or an acknowledgement of the loss but the reception staff appeared unconcerned and unhelpful. They have notices in the bathroom to request that guests do not remove property from the hotel or it will be charged to your account, no reimbursement was given for my pajamas! This is very unfortunate as it is located at a very good spot.

<Content>Not the best experience I have to agree with others here. We are frequent travellers to singapore (3 or 4 times per year) We stayed in the Elizabeth for 5 nights in April. On checking in we found that the room had not been cleaned properly and had to have the safe contents as well as articles remaining from previous occupants removed. The power point nearest the desk was not the standard singapore plug and we were unable to charge our laptop there and had to use one diagonally across the room. Our request for either an extension cord or an adapter for the desk powerpoint was not heeded and after day three we gave up. Also we were not told on booking in that we should purchase breakfast vouchers at reception for use in the restaurant and so we were charged the casual rate for breakfast each day - not the concession given to hotel guests. On querying this at check out we were basically told bad luck. As you can see we were not impressed. Unfortunately even though the location is very convenient, I am afraid we will not be using this hotel again.

<Content>Not upto 4 star standard This hotel really is only good for its location, as previous comments mention it's old and tired. I personally found that the rooms were of poor quality, the food wasn't upto much and the staff weren't particularly friendly. I think i expect more from a 4 star hotel when compared to others that i've stayed in whilst in Singapore. The location however is excellent, very close to Orchard Road and Lucky Plaza. I don't think however that I will be returning to the Elizabeth.

<Content>Old  I have to agree with some of the earlier negative reviews.Stayed here for 1 night (fortunately) and was not at all impressed.Hotel is about 14 yrs old and in dire need of a refurb, which they're apparently undertaking. We were placed on a floor that was undergoing renovations - no noise issues, but the walls  floor of the corridors were covered with a white material and taped down with duct tape which wasn't a pleasant sight. Didn't bother complaining since only there for 1 nite.Room was very tired and dark. Bathroom had that old  dirty feel to it. In fact the room had that dirty feel to it, so much so that we wouldn't walk around barefoot! All in all we just wanted to spend as little time as possible in the room.Location is the only thing going for it. But would definitely recommend the York Hotel (just opposite), where my friend stayed. Rooms were MUCH bigger, clean and actually nice. Same price bracket too.

However it was all very good, service, cleanliness, facilities, the breakfast was okay and the location was great for shopping on Orchard Road. I would certainly use this hotel again.

<Content>Good City Hotel After reading the Reviews I was a bit concerned about the Elizabeth but there were only positive surprises. The Hotel is a perfect City Hotel - you can reach Orchard Road in a walking distance, the rooms are nice and big enough, everything worked in the room, the staff was friendly. It was no problem to use the pool and the dressing room after check out.

<Content>A pleasant surprise Not until staying at Elizabeth have I found a hotel that makes me feel as if I am home although I am away.I counted recently that I have stayed at 12 various hotels (most with more stars than The Elizabeth)over the last years during my trips to Singapore. This time I stayed at Elizabeth for 9 nights. So what鈥檚 good with it? The hotel is tucked away in a fairly quiet neighbourhood, still just a few minutes to the city centre. Either you walk down hill to Orchard Road or take the short cut over the parking lot beside a neighbouring hotel to reach Scott鈥檚 Road. Elizabeth is a medium size hotel with a small and intimate Lobby, attentive staff at the reception and a nice restaurant that serves western food but with some local choices too. The rooms are well appointed and in good condition. All lamps, technical stuff and air con worked. The staff was very helpful when I wanted to change room and have separate beds as my daughter was coming to visit me. As she is not fond of riding elevators it is good to know that two of the four are elevators on the outside with windows so you feel less 鈥渢rapped鈥? The Elizabeth has a small but well maintained gym and over all it is a very friendly and easy going atmosphere in the hotel. The pool is not huge but big enough to take some laps in. It is located in a beautiful little garden with trees that give you shade. You can also have your meals served by the poolside. Being a business woman who travels frequently I appreciate a hassle free stay in a personal and relaxing environment at a good rate. Finally what can be improved? Make sure the greenery don鈥?t grow too high so that there will be no sun at all by the pool and also for elderly it might be tricky to get in our out of the bad tub as it is a bit high. But as I said in the headline- Elizabeth was a pleasant surprise!.
