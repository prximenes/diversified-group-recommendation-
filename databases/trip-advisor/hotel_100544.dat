<Content>Warmest Welcome This was my 2nd stay at the Moore. Be sure to ask for a room on the water side on one of the upper floors, this was the advice I found on tripadvisor.com last year, and the advice I followed. Great view and could just see part of the Public Market neon sign. Everything downtown in easy walking distance, or the free bus zone. The nicest desk clerks who speak well of management and are more than willing to pass on their considerable knowledge about taxis, restaurants, shopping. I was even offered an umbrella for predicted rain.Sizable room and closet, hot water, quiet, clean. This year's surprise, the hand towel/washcloth folded swan has been joined by a bathmat/washcloth elephant. This could be an old European hotel. I couldn't be more pleased with the value for the price, the location, and the personable staff. Some elevator issues during my stay, but hey, may I have half this character and style when I'm 101!

<Content>Close to everything Our stay at the Moore hotel was very enjoyable. We were visiting Seattle on a busy weekend, so rooms were a little hard to find. We took a chance on the Moore after reading some of the reviews on TripAdvisor, and we were glad we did.The hotel is within walking distance to a lot of downtown attractions, especially Pike's Place Market. In fact, if you stay at the Moore, don't even think about renting a car. Parking is too much of a hassle to worry about, and walking is just too easy.There are a couple of things that were not great about the hotel: The immediate surroundings are more sketchy than some of the more touristy areas. Also, the rooms are not air conditioned- which is only a problem because this part of downtown has plenty of bars that can be loud with an open window.Overall, the Moore was great, and the staff is very helpful.

<Content>Great value, great location The Moore's location is ideal: easy walking distance to Pike Public Market, restaurants, and Westlake Center. The rooms have no frills, but are clean, comfortable, high-ceilinged and have refrigerators. Those used to staying in modern hotels like Hyatts, Holiday Inns, Sleep Inns and the like may be disappointed in the furnishings, but this is a turn-of-the-century building with that type of charm. It even has keys for the doors -- not key cards.Staff is friendly, internet in the lobby is free, and some floors have wireless capability (you have to ask for one. The only down side is that it doesn't have parking, requiring some hunting for lots that match your schedule. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others. For $100 a night in downtown Seattle, it's a real bargain.

<Content>An OK place to stay for the price The Moore is located perfectly within easy walking distances of most attractions and downtown Seattle. As others have described its an old place and in need of an update but its fine for the money. I tried three rooms and not a single lock worked properly, took several minutes to lock the room. Receptionists are friendly and Internet access is a big plus point, you'll have an ok time if you're just expecting a basic place to sleep.

<Content>hotel nothing special, but perfect location and perfect price Stayed here for a few nights in july, and the location of the hotel is fantastic. Staff is very helpful, and there's free internet in the lobby (15 min. max). The hotel is quite old, and so are the rooms, but clean and charming. We had a television, but no airco, and fridge or other cookingfacilities in the room. But, for this price and on such a perfect location, you will not find any other option in Seattle!

<Content>Disappointed We stayed for 3 nights at the Moore Hotel but were some what disappointed with our stay. We wanted kitchen facilities as we had 2 couples travelling and wanted to have breakfast and maybe dinner at our room. There was no toaster or kettle available. We had a small fridge, 2 elements and a coffee maker. We are mainly tea drinkers. It was very noisy as it's on a busy street with concerts held next door. Room was clean.

<Content>Spacious, clean  You really have to hunt to find a buget-priced place in Seattle. This place was mentioned in my Lonely Planet guide, and got good reviews on here, so my friend and I stayed there 2 seperate nights in September. For about $110 US a night, this place was an excellent choice. The staff were laid-back but pleasant and helpful. The neighbourhood wasn't too rough, and it's very handy to all the major attractions of Seattle, especially Pike Place markets. The room was simple yet excellent. We had two double beds and a private bathroom (you can go without a bathroom in your room, and use a shared bathroom for less $) The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean, the beds comfortable and immaculate. The room was also spacious and you could open the windows a little to let in fresh air. One of the most lovely things about the hotel was the presentation of the bathrooms. The towels were plentiful and were folded into fan shapes- a really nice touch!Only one drawback- it's a older building, so there was no air conditioning in the room (though a powerful desk fan was provided.) If you're one to suffer the heat, be advised, it could get quite stuffy in summer. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone, especially if you're on a bit of a budget.

<Content>Good value, good location The location of this hotel is great. Minutes from Pike Place market and just a block from the main shopping streets. The hotel's staff was very friendly and helpful to all our questions. Our room wasn't modern but had a good queen bed and a simple but clean bathroom. All in all, good value for your money. Parking was available just a block away for a good price.

<Content>Very clean, great location Since I arrived at the Moore at 2 am I didn't expect a great welcome but the front desk person was expecting me and even warned about the street noise in the morning ( which was nothing much if you live in a city). My room was huge, extremely clean with an enormous closet. The bathroom is very old ( i would say 60 years)...but the shower fixture is new...unfortunately made a very large crack in the tiles and left 2 cemented holes where the taps were. But the location..awesome..I could see the water from my room and it was an easy walk to pike market and to macy's to get the free buses around downtown...and to the airport (not free). Many places to eat and drink around...and Nordstoms Outlet store just 1 block down 2nd. The daytime front desk staff is not particularly friendly but they are knowledgeable

<Content>Simple hotel close to Pike's Place The hotel is very close to Pike's Place Market. We went every day. The rooms are simple but comfortable. Our room even had a fairly big closet. It is noisy on the weekends, but we brought ear plugs anyway. The hotel staff was young and knowledgeable. It does get booked up on the weekends these days because of all the cruise ships leaving from Seattle. This hotel definitely has a hostel-feel to it.

<Content>At least a roof above your head... I found the rating in the other reviews were good, so we contacted the hotel after arriving in Seattle. We were very dissapointed: Noisy (nightclub next to building, busy street), everything looks as if it wasn麓t replaced or repaired the last 40 years and the bed sheets showed lots of holes caused by cigarettes.... In the morning we adults had an icecold shower, the kids refused to do so.... Well, we paid only $130 but this was the highest price we ever spent on a Youth hostel style-room.We will never book this hotel again!

<Content>Good value for the monehy We stayed at the Moore Hotel while spending 3 days in Seattle waiting to board our ship for a cruise to Alaska. We thought the hotel was a pretty good deal. It's easy to get to from SEA-TAC airport. Just take bus 194 and walk the 2 blocks to the hotel. Could not be easier or cheaper at $1.50 one way. The location is great. You are close to Pikes Public Market and downtown Seattle is well within walking distance. However, its location is also the only disadvantage we noted. 2nd Avenue is a pretty busy one way street leading into the downtown area. With the windows open at night, the police car sirens were pretty noticeable as well as pretty frequent. But that is a small price to pay for staying at the Moore.The hotel itself shows character. It is clean and housekeeping was great. The room was large and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom we had was private and had recently been remodeled. No complaints at all. The desk crew was very friendly and helpful. There is a room where you can securely leave your luggage on your last day after checkout for that one last jaunt to the market.All in all we would stay at the Moore again. It's price, location and traditional character make for a pleasant stay.

<Content>Great location The hotel is in a great location only two blocks from the farmers market. Lots of buses run nearbuy aswell so its easy to get around. The hotel itself is a little dated in its decor. We had a european style room which meant the bathroom was shared however there is only one bathroom and toilet for the whole floor (im unsure how many rooms are european style). It would have been nice to be given a bath robe for going to and from the bathroom and any other hotels we stayed in provided these. Overall though it was a nice hotel in a good location.

<Content>Loved the Moore. Perfect for a night before and a night after our cruise. Family of four, with two teenaged children. We had a suite both times, two rooms with a bathroom in the middle for $121. Can't beat it. We were on the 3rd floor the first time, 6th floor the second time. Both floors were updated. It is an older building, but there was fresh paint, it was clean and we even a a towel elephant in the bathroom! TV and fridge in the room, internet in the lobby. Two blocks from the fish market, about 1/2 mile from Whole Foods. The desk clerks were great, helpful and stored our luggage after we checked out. Buses are free, so we were able to get around easily. Seattle has some interesting characters, I don't think they are limited to the Moore hotel area. There seemed to be a lot of tattoed, body pierced folks and homeless people. We are from the Philadelphia area, so this was not so unusual for us, but I can see how some people might be afraid. We had to go to the drugstore in the evening, and we felt safe. One regret is that we did not have a room away from the street. Apparently, the suites all face the street. I did hear the street noise at night, and that woke me. But, the rest of my family was not bothered by it. Otherwise, it was a nice place to stay on a budget. We don't go for fancy accommodations, we go to see the sights.

<Content>Can't beat the price We just got back from the Moore and loved it. The location and price can't be beat. We reserved a single room with a queen sized bed. When we arrived they didn't have any available. They saw that we would be staying for several days so they upgraded us to a suite! Their proximity to Pike Place Market is great...we were down there everyday for breakfast. We read all the other reviews on here about the rooms, neighborhood, etc...so our expectations were dead on...no surprises. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Well, for the money..... Stayed at the Moore of 4 nights in July 2008. The location is excellent, central for what you will want to see in Seattle. Not far from Pike Place Market, close enough for breakfast! We were in one of the top floor rooms with a shared bathroom. Generally, it was just OK, BUT FOR WHAT TOU PAY, I don'tthink it can be bettered. It is clean, comfortable, and excellent value for money

<Content>Perfect place to sleep I went to the Moore with a few co-workers as a getaway to see Seattle's sights. The location was perfect, being close to Pike Market, shopping and the space needle. The hotel itself is old, but it accomodated very well for 4 professional twenty-something girls. The room was very clean, the beds comfortable, had a huge walk-in closet (doubles for a small bedroom, haha) and extremely affordable. I was pleased with the staff, and that they were able to hold our luggage in a securely locked room after we checked out. All in all, it was a great stay!

<Content>Great location for the price! A friend and I toured Portland, Victoria BC, and Seattle at the end of July. We stayed at Marriott properties in the first two cities, and we knew the Moore was a different type of hotel, but we loved the location and the price.For $95 nightly, we had a very basic suite-type room that had been converted from two separate rooms - one with a private bath and one with only a sink. As requested, our room was on the back side of the hotel away from the street, so it was very quiet, other than some banging of doors in the morning as other guests came and went down the hallway. There is no a/c, but this was not an issue as the late July daytime temps never got above 70 degrees during our stay.Our bathroom was nice-sized, with a claw-footed tub/shower combination with good water pressure. Water pressure in the bathroom sink was a little weak.Arriving on the last ferry from Victoria, we checked in after 10 p.m. The clerk who helped us that night, Bob, was very accomodating and even provided us with three different options for dining that would be open late. The next day he helped us with recommendations for more dining options in Capitol Hill. He was very patient and thorough each time we came to him with more questions.If you need luxury, you'd be much more comfortable in one of the $250+ hotel rooms in the nearby chain hotels. If you're looking for a basic room for a great price, the Moore's a good option.

<Content>Dingy but good location and relatively inexpensive My husband and I were on a 12-day trip to Los Angeles, Seattle and untimately San Francisco. We spent 3 nights in Seattle at the Moore Hotel. I have to admit, I am cheap when it comes to paying for lodging, especially if it's only to sleep (and not taking advantages of any amenities), which this one was. But, on the other hand, you do get what you pay for. We were on the 5th floor. It seemed that they were slowly remodeling the hotel because the 3rd floor seemed newly painted and had nice light fixtures in the halls (though didn't see the rooms) , as opposed to our floor that was dingy and creepy, kind of like the place in The Shining.The room was basically that. A decent sized room with a dresser, TV, nightstand with phone and bed. There was no desk or chair. There was nowhere to sit except on the bed. The walk-in closet was nearly as big as the room but that was a non issue for us. No A/C but a small fan on top of the TV. We didn't need AC as the weather was cool in late July. BUT the downside to that was that you had to open your windows.... (not a place for small children as there weren't even screens) to get a breeze. That made for a terribly loud night's sleep. The carpet was creepy (not necessarily dirty, but dingy) and I kept shoes on my feet at all times.The bathroom was the pits. It was old and you had to step up about 18 into THE smallest shower I've ever seen. The thing that killed me and I'm not sure why but the toilet didn't have a cover. Just a seat. Like you're using the bathroom at a rest stop. Since the bathroom was so small, there was no place to put your toiletries and I was afraid that anything I precariously perched on the edge of the sink was going to fall into the toilet. I carried on a lot about the toilet not having a cover and I think my husband got tired of listening to me but I just found it really strange! (We stayed in a Quality Inn in Los Angeles for less than Moore Hotel and the QI had coffee makers in the room AND continental breakfast (and FREE parking) and was way nicer than Moore.)The positive of the place is that the location is BONUS and the rate is fair, keeping in mund what you get for that rate. It's about 3 blocks from Pike's Market which is central. We walked to the space needle and I'd say it was a good mile's walk, but definitely do-able. There's coffee about a block in either direction, but you still have to LEAVE the building.Another minor benefit was internet access in the lobby but even though they post a 15 min time limit, it was in use all the time.I probably wouldn't stay here again. I've never stayed in a hostel, but this place is what I think a hostel would be like. I'm too old for that!! If you're young and/or don't care a bit about amenities this place is fine to sleep, though the bed was cheap and semi-comfortable. This place epitomizes the phrase You get what you pay for. I

<Content>Awesome location, helpful staff, clean rooms We stayed at the Moore Hotel to celebrate a special occasion with a budget getaway in downtown Seattle. The friendly staff offered helpful dining suggestions and surprised us with a spectacular room on the fifth floor. It was amazing to be so close to the waterfront and to have so many attractions within walking distance. The hotel is clean and fantastic value for the traveler who isn't phased by the quirks that come with an older building.

<Content>Great stylish hotel Great stylish hotel for not a whole lotta cash - steps from the Pike Place Market, Belltown and the Space Needle. Staff was welcoming - didn't blink an eye when we showed up with our three kids five-years-old  under - even rustled up a crib for us. Mix of back-packers, hipsters and euro-travelers. Awesome dive bar on the first floor - which the kiddies prevented us from checking out - next time.

<Content>Unremarkable, Good Location The Moore Hotel gives you the option of staying in a great location in Seattle for not a lot of money. Other than that, there isn't much to say. The room was nicely sized but awkwardly laid out so you couldn't really use the space. The bathroom was really small and old. You get what you pay for, though, and this hotel is a clean and a good deal for budget travel in Seattle.

<Content>Won't get fooled again! We booked Moore hotel after reading all the positive reviews on Travel Advisory. I generally find the reviews helpful, and thus thought all the good reviews for the Moore Hotel were an indication of a potentially positive experience and I really looked forward to it. On the contrary, it turned out to be a very short and bitter experience. Okay, it's low cost, and in the end, you get what you pay for. But it just does not deserve all the positive reviews...The one and only elevator broke down (not the first time according to another guest), so that was a struggle for someone at the 6th trying to bring luggage up or down. No airconditioning, but instead a small fan was provided to help the guest battle the July Seattle heat. The telephone was poor quality and one could hardly hear the other line. Parking was a block away, meaning one would have to walk a block back to the hotel even late at night in a neighborhood of old buildings, homelesss and lower-end nightclubs. The window pane in our daughters' room was broken and was open and difficult to close. The allegedly excellent staff were not very helpful. When my daughter complained about the broken lift, the comment was there were a million and a half other things to do. A sketch to tell me where the secure parking area was located was inaccurate and I had to drive around several times before finding it. One chap behind the counter was completely useless, just giving me a blank stare whenever I asked a question. He was the one who drew the inaccurate map to the parking lot. When we complained about the broken window, we were told that there was no risk since the window could not be opened (which was not true) and and anyway the hotel would not offer that room if it were not safe. We stayed all of one hour. We booked two rooms, but we only occupied one room while deciding whether to stay or move elsewhere. When we finally decided to move, they insisted that I pay for the full night for both rooms, even if we didn't touch the other one (we did go in and have a look). I had no choice but to pay, otherwise they would just charge my credit card. They gave me a statement but no receipt, and had absolutely no sympathy for our situation, insisting that this was a business and that their policy was what it was.After this experience, I will now have to check twice as long and hard at the reviews to make sure I won't get fooled again.

<Content>Great find! We needed a place to spend the night on our return to the states from Canada as our flight left in the am. I wanted to be near Pike Place market so my son could see the fish throwing before we headed to Sea-Tac, I found the Moore, and couldn't belive the rate ($80/nt plus taxes and fees in downtown Seattle!). It seemed a little sketch/hostel-y on its website, and in my 30's with a child I'm not too into that, but the reviews were such that I felt that we should give it a shot. It was wonderful, the staff was nice and helpful, check in was a breeze and it was obvious staff was attentive to who was entering the hotel to make sure they belonged there. Our room was right on the street (6th floor), but a fan was in the room and once turned on you couldn't hear any of the traffic down below. The bathroom had been recently redone and was neat, clean, and attractive. The room was large, and the beds comfortable. Add to that the the location is unbeatable - this hotel is a jewel!

<Content>Great Price and Location This is a great value in a great location in downtown Seattle. It was located near everything we wanted to go to. It is just a few blocks from Pike Place Market. The hotel is very old and a little creepy. It was very clean and comfortable and the staff was helpful. I would recommend it for travelers who aren't superstitious and are looking for a bargan.

<Content>Cheap, clean and close to downtown I stayed here for one week at the beginning of May 2008. This is seriously a really great hotel in Seattle. The price is right, the location is brilliant, and the staff are friendly and helpful (Bob who works afternoon/evenings is a goldmine of information on where to eat, where to go and what to see).I stayed in the room without a bathroom (it just had a sink) on the 5th floor with a view of the sound (with a foreground view of a rooftop carpark!) I found the room big and clean, the bed comfortable and the tv had a zillion channels! It was a tiny bit annoying that the wifi doesn't really work in the rooms, but it can be accessed in the lobby. The shared bathrooms were cleaned everyday and didn't smell bad. The floor I stayed on was not a renovated floor - so be sure to ask for a renovated room. The hotel is old, so the hallways are a bit dark and overall the hotel doesn't look like a new modern/contemporary hotel. The decor is kind of old too, but the location (2 blocks from Pike Place Market) and the price definitely makes up for this. I would definitely recommend this place! (If you stay here, grab a pastry and coffee from Pike Place market for breakfast!)

<Content>Great Value We stayed at the Moore hotel for 5 nights in May.Location is great, only a couple of minutes walk to Pikes Market. Room was spacious and clean, bathroom was good. Even though it is in an older building, everything in the room was in good working condition.Excellent value for money considering how expensive hotels are in Seattle. Friendly front desk. We traveled with our 1 year old, and there is a crib available for use. (There was some confusion when we arrived as to whether the hotel does have portable cribs - but they do!).Would definitely recommend the Moore hotel.

<Content>Excellent choice. location and value. great staff May 23rd 2008 we stayed before our Alaskan cruise. Found online and researched the hotel. The best choice for location to Pikes Market and downtown and best value in town by far. We stayed on the 3rd floor, great room-size perfect; daughter loved the clawfoot bathtub. Thought the room was well done and the bathroom was a good size. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Easy to find and reach from the airport. We stored luggage in the morning and came back to check in. Same the next day before leaving-we stored and checked out and then went off walking again. Would stay again when visiting town.

<Content>IA Wonderful Hotel! This was my 1st visit to Seattle and a birthday present to myself. I couldn't have picked a nicer hotel to stay in. I stayed in a room on the 3rd floor with a lovely view of downtown; the room was spacious, comfortable, spotless, and the towels were folded into animal and fan shapes. There was a nice walk-in closet, table and chairs and a Sony T.V. I stayed for 3 days and checked out, with the intention of going home, but decided to stay 1 more day and checked into the Moore again. This time I got a room on the 6th floor in the back, and it was much quieter, being away from the traffic. I recommend asking the desk clerk for parking recommendations. Bob, on the evening shift is great and very helpful to everyone needing recommendations for restaurants, etc. (I made the mistake of not asking and parked in the Republic Parking NW lot and got scammed by a street person posing as a parking attendant). I didn't realize parking was free on the street from 6 pm to 8 am. For proximity to the Pike's Market and the waterfront, plus walking distance to most everything downtown, the Moore is perfect. The staff is wonderful, the hotel is clean and charming, and I won't stay anywhere else when I return to Seattle!

<Content>Moore is a deal! I stayed at The Moore a few years ago by accident. I had booked a place online that turned out to be a total dump when someone on the street recommended The Moore as a safer, bargain-alternative for a friend and I. We found it pretty bare bones but clean and with friendly staff that made us feel at home. Coming back a few years later, it appeared the place had a bit of a facelift- some new paint, upgrades to the room, etc. It is still pretty basic: a smallish TV and not much else in the way of amenities but the bed was comfy and the room clean. The place has some cool history and the room, despite the recent coat of paint, had some funky touches: big ol' Victorian bathtub, noisy but quaint furnace in the room, etc. The Nitelite Bar downstairs is also superconvenient if you want to stay close to the hotel but go have a drink/bite to eat. On the subject of convenient, that is probably the best thing about this place: the proximity of the hotel to Pike Place, shopping, the Seattle Art Museum, etc. etc . Great place to stay on a budget esp. if you don't want to rent a car and want to hoof it around the downtown!

<Content>Excellent hotel - great location We had just returned from our Alaskan cruise vacation, and the Moore hotel is only 5 mins taxi journey from the pier. If you have a small bag, its walkable. However, we had a lot of luggage so had to get the taxi. It cost no more than $8. The Moore Hotel is in a fantastic location. Just a couple of blocks away from the pike market place and Westlake centre. The rooms were huge and the walk in closet was excellent. We booked two rooms and stayed for 1 night. The rooms were ready when we checked in at around 10:30am. The bathroom was very clean and the reception staff were very helpful. There is also a free wireless internet access in the lobby if you have your own wireless enables laptop. Also, there is fixed computer in the lobby which offers free internet access. There is no breakfast nor complimentary coffee, but who needs that when there are 100s of Starbucks around you! I would definitely be staying here again if I visited Seattle.

<Content>Pretty good. I spent two nights at the Moore. I'd really like to give it a 3.5, but I can't. The Moore is a really cool old hotel in an excellent location to walk around Seattle and see the sights. Also in a good spot for nightlife and funky restaurants.I checked in late the first night, and the staff was very accomodating. My room was large and clean. The bed was comfortable and I had a great view of Elliot Bay out my window (7th floor). Although I was right near the elevator, I could only hear minimal noise. No shampoo or conditioner, but ehn, I brought my own anyway.I just parked on the street, which is free from 6pm to 8am. At 8 I came out and paid the parking meter. $3 for 2 hours.Then I picked up my friend from the airport and we drove to Vancouver.We returned to Seattle for our final night, and our stay was slightly less great. Our room was still nice, freshly painted and clean, but the faucet for the shower was falling off and very difficult to use. The night staff on this night was also not very friendly. I interrupted a 20 minute conversation between the desk agent and a guest for some information (I was using the guest computer, while I waited) . The clerk was very unhappy, although the guest seemed relieved.It was great to have a guest computer, but a printer (for a boarding pass) would have been very welcome. And they will NOT print it for you.I'll stay again, but I'll save my questions for the friendly and helpful day staff.

<Content>Dont use a google map to get here! Excellent location We arrived at the Victoria Clipper ferry port and had a google map to the hotel and thought we would walk (2 blocks). However, the google map was wrong - the hotel was about 8 blocks to the right and it was a really long walk which we were not expecting. There seemed to be a nice block and then a dodgy block so we felt a little vulnerable on the way. We were relieved to find the hotel and the lobby was shabby but the security of the lift and room were good. The room was huge and well appointed. The bathroom had a few chipped tiles, but very inventive towel-folding (shaped into an elephant!) which made us smile. We had no problems, the staff were helpful and the location was great - easy access to to the pike place market and shopping areas. The greyhound bus station was not too far away either. For the money it was a bargain and if I stayed at Seattle again, I would def. stay here.

<Content>A great Value I have stayed in this hotel on several occasions when I have had to work so late I did not feel like commuting home. It is a very basic hotel but it is far and away the least expensive you will find in downtown Seattle by a hefty margin.I have always requested the European Rooms (Shared Batchroom) because they are even less expensive and I have always got what I expected, a Clean bed and a no-frills room. The shared bathrooms are clean if you get up early, but wait until after 9am and its bit messy. My only recomendation is that you request a room on the backside (alley) or a top floor room, as the street will get a little noisy on Friday and Saturday nights.As for the neighborhood, it's no less or more safe after dark than any other downtown location. It is also close to Pike Market.

<Content>great location Stayed at the Moore for two nights with a friend.Pros: great location a few blocks from Pike Place Market and downtown shopping, friendly staff and a clean bedroom, good mattress.Cons: bathroom needed updating (cracks in shower, mold around shower), hotel could use some updating. Hotel doesn't provide shampoo so bring your own.I'd stay here again based on location and price. The bed was comfortable and the room was large.

<Content>Best deal in town if you don't mind a shabby lobby The Moore Hotel is the best deal in Seattle. On a recent winter weekend, they were charging half of what the other downtown hotels wanted. Don't let the somewhat shabby lobby scare you off. However, while the front desk staff is great, service is lacking. A broken light fixture in the closet went unrepaired despite 3 requests. (Aren't energy effiicient light bulbs great.) Also, avoid the rooms with bath down the hall. Finally, ask for a quiet room away from the 2 busy streets. You can't beat the location -- close to Pike Place Market and the restaurants and shops of Bell Town. Take the 194 bus from the airport--just a $1.50 non stop.

<Content>Best hotel in Seattle My girlfriend and I were in Seattle for my birthday, staying at the Sheraton. My girlfriend is the type to always seek out the hotelwere she can have room service for every meal; she loves to bewaited on. Well, we missed out departing flight and were stuckin a city with ZERO rooms available (Neil Diamond was in town).We needed to book a room fast.I got online and found nothing, and then I came across the Moore Hotel. Not only did they have ample rooms, but the rate wasCHEAP. My girlfriend complained the entire way to the hotel,because it wasn't the Hilton, Four Seaons, etc. She nicknamedthe place the No-Moore Hotel befre we even arrived.Once we arrived, the hotel had SO much personality. Everything was exceptional, rate paid considered. We will both be staying hereevery time we visit Seattle. I can not go on about this place enough!!I truely rate this hotel five stars for its charm and resonable rate!

<Content>Hidden Gem When booking this hotel online we were pretty skeptical. The images of the hotel were not the best and the description was pretty vague. The price was right for our budget at the time so we took a chance. Very glad we did, this hotel was charming and historical.  Outside:From the outside the hotel looks 鈥渨orn鈥? something you would expect from a 100 year old building. Parking is hard to come by anywhere down town in Seattle, so the Moore is no exception. Plan on paying for parking; use the parkade across the street. It gets locked up at night, and since crime is a big issue in down town Seattle it will just give you that little extra piece of mind that your car is locked away. Parking will cost you $20.00 per day in the parkade.Lobby:Once you step inside, you are greeted with a marbled reception like area. Friendly staff to check you in promptly and help with any questions or concerns. The building has a very outdated elevator, something that is par for the course considering the age of the building. The hallways (corridors) are extremely wide. Something you just do not see, it was refreshing.Rooms:There are two types of rooms available in this hotel. There are the ones who have stood the test of time and those who have been decorated to meet today鈥檚 style. We were lucky enough to be told up front and requested a new room. Here you get the privilege of having your own personal bathroom. That鈥檚 right folks, not all rooms have their own bathroom. Some floors have communal bathrooms so be sure to ask for an updated room. The room we stayed in was on the 7th floor. It was spacious, clean, funky paint job, and looked over the harbor.All in all we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. It was a great, inexpensive way to be in the heart of down town and not in one of those 鈥渟tuffy鈥?hotels. The Moore is very close to the Pike鈥檚 Market, about a 5 minute walk at the most. Shopping centers, movie theatres and numerous restaurants all within a 5 minute walk as well.

<Content>Clean, Cozy and Excellent Value The Moore was a pleasant surprise after reading some of the reviews on this website. Our room was a suite, with a kitchenette, living room and big bathroom. The kitchen was set up beautifully with origami napkins and everything else you need if you wanted to make food at your suite. The beds were clean and comfortable and the television worked perfectly. Our room had a view of Puget Sound. For the price, I recommend a suite on the top floor. We will stay at the Moore again and again. Cheers to you guys for keeping an old gem alive and well.

<Content>Highly Recommended We were looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a good location and found this to be the perfect choice. Although it is not especially plush the Moore Hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff were very helpful. If you want to see all that Seattle has to offer you cannot be in a better location - two blocks from Pike Street Market with Macys and other major stores 2 blocks in the other direction. The 'tour bus' stop is just a 2 minute walk away which takes you all around Seattle and stops at all the major attractions.

<Content>GREAT location, fine stay will stay again IF..... The Moore only looks a little sketchy from the outside. Once you're inside, it's solidly average and a great value in Seattle, which has outrageously priced hotels, for some bizarre reason.We went into our stay open minded, not expecting any more than cleanliness and a great location. Yes, the rooms are spartan -- we opted to splurge on a room with it's own bathroom rather than to share. The tub/shower was fine -- an old clawfoot tub, which was cool. However it was very difficult to regulate the hot water and I got scorched a couple times. The initial staff that we dealt with when checking in were very pleasant but the night clerk, Bill, is a total jerk. One of our pillows was exceptionally flat and when we came in from dinner and a show approximately 10:30pm, I asked for an additional pillow and another bath towel. Bill rolled his eyes and acted like I had asked him to jog around the block twice in his undies. As Bill complained and slammed things around in a storage area behind the desk, I told him, Nevermind -- I'll make due. He responded with a snarky, Yeah, I'm just going through the motions here. In other words, he was just pretending to look for a pillow. What a jerk. Other than Bill, everything was fine at the Moore. The location is perfect, our room was clean and comfortable. However, I can imagine that in the summer it must be hot as hell on the upper floors and there is no air conditioning. Probably fine for most of the summer but if you got an unexpected heat wave, it would be really uncomfortable.

<Content>Affordable downtown hotel This is an affordable downtown hotel that has recently been renovated, it appears. The rooms are comfortable and clean. The location is great, but do note that this is right downtown, so there is plenty of noise. I slept just fine with earplugs and the windows closed. If you're there during a heatwave, you may be sorry you chose this hotel. There is no A/C and the portable fans provided in the room are tiny. The hotel has no parking, so expect to pay $15-17 a day in nearby lots.

<Content>Quaint and a great value! My fiance and I were in town for a wedding and did not want to break the bank. Thanks to a write-up in the Lonely Plant, we discovered the Moore Hotel. The rate was unbelieveable and the hotel was centrally located to many of Seattle's renowned attractions (Pike's Place market is only two blocks). The hotel was quaint and charming and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. We convinced four friends of ours to also stay at the Moore, and they were delighted with their spacious suite. Street noise was not a problem for us and we found the surrounding neighborhood to be nice and safe, with plenty of good restaurants. We all will definitely stay at the Moore Hotel again when we return to Seattle!

It is centrally located, we could walk to almost everything Seattle has to offer. And the staff was super friendly  helpful, especially Bob at the front desk.The only negative is the hotel is on a busy street, so bring earplugs!!

<Content>Absolutely will stay there again! We had our concerns when we booked at the Moore for Sept 6  7, because you get what you pay for, right? And any accommodations anywhere else would have been more than triple. We were very pleasantly surprised! We got more than we paid for. The rooms were clean and spacious with character. Even though Megadeth was playing at the theater, we slept soundly. We will absolutely stay there again. The location is excellent. We used the city bus service, so parking was not a problem. Although there was no air conditioning, open windows and fans kept us comfortable. Splurge on the John Malkovich suite if it is available (private joke, you'd have to see it.)

<Content>Fantastic budget find so close to Pike Market and cafes Myself and a gal pal were in town for a reunion of expatriates.We wanted to be close to all the touristy sites, the expat dinner venue, and not spend a small fortune.The Moore is fantastic. You can walk everywhere from it and the local neighborhood is undergoing (prob has undergone) a gentrification, and has many cafes and eateries. The beds and rooms were large and beds comfortable. The rooms both had TVs and a fridge - great for ensuring water bootles remained cold.We were able to walk to Pike market and the ferries, plus it was easy for friends to drop by and take us on tours. The staff are extremely friendly and we even had a view! Its an older hotel and we had two adjoining rooms connected by a bathroom. The only downside is I think the owners bought the towels when the hotel 1st opened - take your own as they are small and a bit thin. But the shower worked well with great pressure.There is a (slow) older elevator for those needing one. The clientele looked like it covered all ages and many were heard to say how they returned time and time again.There is a nice bar next door and there is a music theater 2 doors, up but we did not hear anything from our room.I would stay here again, and intend to!

<Content>Good budget option I stayed here for 2 nights in a single room with shared bath. The room had a sink with mirror, small TV, small fan and large closet. The building is old and the rooms have seen better days, especially the carpets. The bed sheets were scratchy - no Egyptian cotton here! Shared baths were clean. Bottles of cold water could be purchased anytime for $1 at the reception. Staff were friendly and helpful. The sliding lock on my door was broken, but I could lock the doorknob with my key. My room overlooked the street at the front of the building and the traffic noise was bothersome, especially the night of the Torchlight Parade for Seafair. The fan helped that a little. The second night, there were people talking loudly and walking around all night and their voices echoed in the halls. It sounds a little miserable, but it's no different than a youth hostel. The location can't be beat, so if you need a cheap place to crash downtown, this place is good enough.

<Content>Indenty Theft Alert I usually stay at the Moore a couple times a year, without any problems.I always book in advance and pay with my credit card.Last time they asked for my drivers license.With Identity theft on the rise - I told them I didn't have a problem showing ID - but I wasn't going to let them write my Drivers License down.The Moore Hotel said that unless they wrote my drivers license down - I wouldn't be allowed to rent a room.I told them that the Hilton didn't require extra ID and My group went there instead.I reported them to Visa.

<Content>Great location, reasonable price We stayed at the Moore for 2 nights prior to our Alaska cruise trip. The Moore locates in a very good location. You can walk to the pier, pike place market and downtown area easily. I went jogging along the waterfront and to the nice park and enjoyed it. We walk to our NCL Pearl at Pier 66 to board our ship and it is a nice walk downhill. So, location is excellent for the price.The hotel is not fancy but clean. We spend a little more to have our own bathroom, instead of sharing, which is worth the money. There is a small TV, but no refrigerator or drink. But, that is not a problem because you can walk to buy all the stuff you want nearby.This hotel is good for budget traveller who wants to stay near downtown area. By the way, we have a great time in Alaska and NCL pearl is fanstastic.

<Content>Pretty good As a single young woman traveling alone, I was a little wary as to what the hotel/surrounding area would be like. But the Moore Hotel felt safe and in a great location for the price I paid. The only time I really felt scared is when I arrived at 3am due to a delayed flight. and had to walk a couple blocks to the motel from the bus stop. (I know, not the best situation for any area of any big city) No one gave me problems, but just be aware that it might not feel completely safe walking in the area alone late at night. The motel is just a short walk from the Pike Place Market and bus routes to other places. I even walked to the Space Needle from the hotel, but it is was quite a long walk.I was most impressed with the housekeeping staff! They deep cleaned my room between the nights of my stay. They also have origami washclothes/towels every day.I chose to share a bathroom (European style) to keep things cheaper. The bathrooms were clean, but other hotel guests frequently had left their towels laying around and a hair or two in the tub. That didn't bother me, but it may bother some people. If you showered first in the morning, you'd have a completely clean shared bathroom.

<Content>Fantastic City good location in Belltown We arrived to our suite on the 3rd floor. The room was very spacious and had a great dining area. The room was quite dated and had a strange smell which soon disppeared. The staff were mostly helpful and there is free internet in the reception. The location is ideal 2 blocks away from pike place market and puget sound, the main shoppinng area is 3 blocks away.Although I really enjoyed my stay at The Moore, if I was to return to Seattle I would probably stay in a more upmarket hotel but in the same area.Seattle is a fantastic city to visit, lots of things to do however if you want to watch the orcas in the Sound, make sure that you book well in advance with Victoria Clipper based on Pier 69 as they get very busy and don't go with another company based on pier 67 which are rips offs. Also don't be fooled by the 'scenic Washington Dinner Train' don't go what a waste of money, scenic views meant 3 hours of looking at trees, the food was poor.Overall loved Seattle and the people were very friendly.

<Content>Great location, but sub-par suites We wanted a reasonably priced hotel in the middle of Seattle, and we certainly got that. We got one of the suites on the 4th floor, and I've got to say that it was in desperate need of an update (and I'm not picky). It seemed like they were updating some of the other floors, but they didn't get to that one yet. Essentially they took 3 rooms and knocked down the walls to make a suite. Unfortunately, they only left 1 bathroom and you had to walk through the bathroom to get to 1/2 the bedrooms. It certainly makes it inconvenient when someone is using the bathroom! It reminded me of a few apartments I had right out of college.On the good side, it was in a great location, and I never felt unsafe. It's obvious that it attracts a younger crowd. When we checked in, it looked like the 1st day of college dorm check in.I would probably return, but opt for smaller rooms on the updated floors before going for the suite.

<Content>Fine, for what you pay for My boyfriend and I are both students and booked into The Moore for a weekend away. We paid $66 plus taxes a night for a double room with no bathroom. This was during what is still considered 鈥渉igh鈥?season in Seattle (Seattle being what I consider to be an expensive hotel city, but I digress). Look, The Moore isn鈥檛 fancy, but for $66 what are you expecting? Our room was on the 7th floor. It was small, but CLEAN and I felt SAFE which is all that matters, to me at least. The bathroom and showers were just down the hall, but I never encountered any one when I went to use them. The staff are very helpful and kind. Yes, there is some noise from the street and The Moore theatre below if there is a concert going on. As for the 鈥榮treet鈥?people, they鈥檙e harmless and left us alone, which was refreshing (considering we鈥檙e from Vancouver where you can encounter aggressive panhandling) and I felt pretty safe in the area. The Night Lite lounge was great for a quick drink, $3 beers cant go wrong!. Great location, 2 block to pike place market, 2 block to GREAT shopping in the Pine Street area. The hotel is also in the middle of the 鈥榝ree鈥?zone for busses, which makes it pretty cheap to zip around down town. We were so busy out seeing Seattle we didn鈥檛 spend much time at the hotel, except to sleep. Ask for a room higher up, you鈥檒l encounter less noise.

<Content>Scary  This hotel is about 3 blocks from Pike's Street Market and 11 blocks from Amtrak station. That is one of the reasons we chose it. Problems: It's really old and needs renovation, there is no air condition, there are street people hanging outside the door, there is no parking for the hotel, parking behind hotel is $7 for 2 hours, there are night clubs opened most of the night so you get entertained wheither you want to or not, you can't close the windows because there is no a/c, some of the windows are at fire escape so you don't want to leave them open, and last but not least, the mirror in the bathroom opens to the outside.

<Content>Great Value I was delighted with my stay at the Moore. I was a little concerned as I approached the hotel on foot as the there are several parking lots in the immediate area, which is therefore not very scenic. However, my room (722) was clean, spacious and very comfortable, with a partial view of the bay. The front desk staff were helpful and the location was great for Pike Place market. It was a great bargain at only $70 for a single. I will definitely stay here again and may splurge on room 724, a one bedroom corner suite that looked fantastic for $170 a night.

<Content>Great find! Absolutely great hotel! When I saw the outside I thought it might be a bit run down but I found no problems. It is a little dated looking but I thought everything was fine. The 2 guys on reception were really helpful with tips of where to go and were really friendly. There is free internet in reception for hotel guests although it can get a little busy at times....guests are asked to limit to 15mins a go.The room I had was on the top floor (7th - I had asked for a quiet room). It was large, roomy, clean and great views of the Olympia mountains! The bathroom was clean and even had origami towels. Had a bath/shower so you could chose and a fridge too.There is only 1 lift and it is a bit old and small but it never broke down or anything when I was there.The area is not the greatest but then a lot of Seattle I found to be the same. I walked everywhere and had no problems. The hotel is a 15min walk or so from the Victoria Clipper terminal. Its right beside Pike Place which is a lively place with loads of places to get breakfast and stuff. Its about a 10-15 minute walk to the shopping hub with all your shops. I loved the hotel and would have no problem staying there again. The price was great too!!!

<Content>Decent location and nice staff; everything else very disappointing I read many reviews on citysearch and trip advisor re: Moore Hotel. Called to book; only shared bathroom queen room was avail. I lived/traveled in Europe for over a year; didn't think shared bath would be a problem. However, fiance and I shared a bathroom (one toilet, one shower) with an entire floor (we stayed in room 403). That is, 25 rooms: 1 bathroom. Yes, you read correctly, 25 rooms with at least 2 people in each room, and ONE bathroom. Everytime, day/night/6am/midnight/noontime that we tried to use shower, it was busy. Paper-thin walls, no shower, toilet so far from room, tiny room with dirty sink in room, and smaller-than-reserved-bed...well, we were miserable. Asked to change rooms but were told they were full. Tried to find another hotel in Seattle for under $150/night, impossible. Loved the town but will never, never, never stay at this hotel again. Passed many homeless/drunk/druggie-looking types on way to hotel each night---for sure I wouldn't have felt safe without my 6'5 fiance on my arm. Wanted to warn everyone with our experience--try to stay in Capitol Hill or Belltown, both close enough to downtown action/shops/mass transit and far enough away to enjoy more of the locals' Seattle.

<Content>Origami towels! We stayed in this hotel two years ago and had a good experience then (obviously, otherwise we wouldn't have bothered to come back this year). The hotel is clean, friendly and it has a nice authentic touch. We stayed for four days in two adjoining rooms with a bathroom in the middle. The rooms had enough space, the beds were okay and we liked the antique details like the lamps and the doors. Also great was the distance to Pike Place, shops and restaurants (Crocodile Caf茅 is fun, also for breakfast!). The bathroom was a bit small but the shower was hot and the origami towels were really nice.But... don't expect roomservice or fancy shampoos. Accept that (in the weekends) there is some noise from the street below. And don't bring to much luggage, for it might not fit in the elevator in one time.

<Content>Moore is the greatest hotel for price and location I love this hotel -- WILL DEFINITELY STAY AGAIN on my next trip to Seattle.Quite unpretentious, room is large, clean bathroom, clean everything. the friendliest staff on the planet, quiet, well-insulated rooms, loved the clawfoot bathtubs - very ornate and quite unique.Very reasonably priced. Only few minutes walk to Pikes Market and heart of Downtown, Ross Dress for Less and Macy's, greatest location for the price.I will definitely come back.

<Content>Excellent Choice We stayed at the moore 7-22 thru 7-26-07. Had a view of Elliot Bay and the mountains from the 6th floor. Where will you get that for $70 a night in Seattle? It can be a bit noisy facing busy Virginia St. but after walking the city all day and running the fan in your room you will sleep just fine. The rooms are clean, simple and comfortable no complaints at all. Location Location Location it super it's a short walk to Pikes Place Market and many other attractions. It's hilly so wear your walking shoes...

<Content>Very poor service After seeing a large renovated suite in this hotel, we booked months ahead so our daughter and her friends could see a concert there. We confirmed it a week or so before our arrival. When we got to the front desk, we were told that we didn't have a reservation and that that room was booked. We later learned that someone else had wanted the room for the whole weekend, so they had given it to them and shafted us, and were lying. They ended up giving us two smaller rooms instead, one renovated where the kids stayed, and one that had not been renovated. Had difficulty locking the door to one room, lock seemed out of alignment. My wife hated the room. There seemed to be drag racing on the street outside until late in the morning, she had trouble sleeping. The teenagers, on the other hand, were happy, and ate at the Crocodile down the street, while we went to Momma's Mexican a few blocks away. Neighbourhood is dicey, but so is the whole of this area, no unpleasant encounters, though many homeless people. Parking is terrible, expensive. .

<Content>Funky This boutique hotel is different because it is very plain. No a/c, small tvs, and minimalist decor. This is NOT a fancy place, but it is the right price for budget-minded travellers.The biggest problems are:1. PARKING- The hotel has no parking and no agreement with local garages. You'll wind up parking nearby for about $20/day with limited access to your car, especially after dark.2. Neighborhood- While it is two blocks from the Pike Place market, the street is a little rundown and a little shady after dark. The street noise might keep you awake at night in the summer.3. Maintenance- The hot water did not work in our bathroom sink and the elevator is small and noisy. After 9pm, you have to use the elevatorAll those things being said, you cannot deny the value of this hotel for its location. Just be prepared to get the level of amenities appropriate for your money.

<Content>Good Budget Hotel We stayed for one night at this hotel, which is clean, quiet and has a great, central location. Not to mention having reasonable rates!I would say, however, that the hotel is still undergoing redecoration and we were given a very drab room that had us thinking of the song Hotel California.On the other hand, we DID arrive prior to check-in, but the staff were very friendly and could see we were eager to get settled. Had we been patient I am certain we would have been put in one of the newer rooms.The Pike Place Market is two blocks away (downhill), and Belltown is right there so there are plenty of options for dining. Seattle is also a very walkable city (aside from some of those hills).I am not the type who really takes decor into consideration, though. All I really want is a room for a reasonable rate that is clean, quiet, comfortable and located in a good area. And the Moore Hotel certainly met all of those qualifications. They also have cable television and free internet access if you bring your laptop. If you're expecting doorman service, bellhops, extra linens, etc., this is not the place for you. That kind of hotel you would spend over $200 a night for.

<Content>Cozy This hotel may appear old and run down from the outside but I found it quant, clean, and roomy on the inside. I rented a room that had a bathroom. The room had room and even though the building was older it was clean. The was location was great, (2 blocks from Pikes Place).I stayed for 3 nights. My only complaints were thin walls, (you could hear chatter next door even when others were using speaking voices), and one night were the neighbors liked to party late.

<Content>Very charming, great location, no frills The Moore Hotel is an incredibly charming old building with a fantastic location in downtown Seattle. It's just minutes from Pike Place and within walking distance of many other attractions.I booked the Moore because it was one of the least expensive places to stay with easy access to the city's center. We arrived late on a Wednesday night and were leaving Seattle late afternoon on a Thursday, so wanted to maximize our time to see Seattle. We parked our car down the street without much trouble and left it there overnight. There was some noise from the street at night, but it wasn't a big deal.The rooms are no frills. Both my friends and I booked ensuite rooms with two beds in each room. The rooms had a fan but no air conditioning (and given that high temperatures are rare in Seattle, this wasn't a problem). Although the rooms show their age, they were clean and charming -- the bathroom had an old-style cast-iron bath with legs. The towels were made up by housekeeping to resemble a swan, which was a nice touch. Doors on the room were very old-style: wooden doors with key locks from both the outside and the inside. There was also a single computer with internet access near the front desk for free use. The check-in desk staff were polite, friendly, and helpful when asked for advice about the local area.I would recommend the Moore Hotel for individual travellers, students, and even families who don't mind a very no-frills inexpensive hotel in return for a fantastic location. It's quite a charming place with an old-style feel to it, and I would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Perfect For Us! I love old hotels! When I was searching the web for a place to have a mini-family reunion, I was pleased to find the Moore Hotel. One could tell that the owners are trying to keep its 1907 flavor. The ceiling lighting fixtures and cast iron bathtubs were true to the hotel's era. The Moore reminded me of some of the hotels that I have stayed in in Europe. We had two private sleeping rooms with a Jack-n-Jill bathroom on the 6th floor. One room had a queen bed and the other had two twin beds. The beds were very comfortable. The furniture was your basic budget hotel variety and was well kept. The closets were huge. I enjoyed looking out the windows at the different periods of architecture in the area and the bits of the waterfront that could be seen beyond the buildings. Our rooms were basic, but very clean. There is no air conditioning, but the windows opened to allow for a nice breeze. Each room also had a fan. The staff was the best!! Everyone aimed to please. They guided us to some great eateries, explained the parking situation so that we were able to stretch our vacation dollars, and helped us polish off a birthday cake from Cold Stone's Creamery. There is a room where the management will hold your luggage after checkout time if need be. The location was great! We were two blocks up from Pike Market, four blocks from the car rental office, and four blocks from the mono-rail station that took us to the Space Needle and Seattle Center.  We encountered some homeless people in the area, but we also encountered them in other parts of Seattle as well. None of them were rude or forceful.  The area around the hotel buzzes with nightlife as there are a variety of clubs in the area. This was a plus for us as we had a birthday in our group that needed to be celebrated with more than cake and ice cream. The only drawback that we encountered was the noise from the street. We used our portable radio as white noise and were not bothered by the traffic sounds. We will definitely be back!!

<Content>Great hotel for the price The Moore Hotel itself is an excellent place to stay for the money but not so much if you are driving a vehicle. Parking is a bear around the hotel. We had to wake up at 7:00am every morning when our overnight parking expired to pay additional fare, we spent almost $100 in parking fees. I would definately stay there again if I flew to Seattle but not if I drove.

<Content>Loved The Moore My husband  I stayed at The Moore 6/9/07  6/17/07 (before  after a cruise). On our first stay we arrived before check in, but when the desk clerk heard our story about being stranded by the airport shuttle in the rain without our suitcases  not knowing where we were, he volunteered to find us a room we could check into early. The room was VERY clean  I thought it was alot larger than some newer hotel rooms. The tub is old, so it was huge! You can lay down in it. The bed was comfortable.Our rooms had recently been redone. In the morning we asked the desk clerk were we could catch a cab to the terminal, she said have a seat and I'll call you one. Did'nt expect this much service for the price.On our second stay we arrived very early, 8:30(cruise ships are in at 6AM). The clerk stored our bags for us  told us that check in wasn't until 3PM but that we would probably be tired by than  to come back around noon  she would have a room for us. She did!Both rooms we had were near the elevator, it didn't bother us at all. We delt with 3-4 different front desk employees, all were more than friendly and very helpful. We did see some homeless in the area, but no one bothered us. TWO blocks from Pike's Market  walking distance to the water, Seattle Center, the monorail  more! This was a bargin of a lifetime. About a block away is the Virginia Inn. We had a great dinner there on our first night. Lowell's in the market is really good for breakfast (ate there both mornings). Met friends there our first day for lunch, the clam chowder is horrible. Ivars on the water has the best clam chowder I have ever had.(Had this the second time thru Seattle)Another great bargin. The double decker (narrated) bus tour.. $18. per person, good for 2 days. Ride it all around, get off when you want ,sightsee, walk around..get back on when the next bus comes thru..do it again,all over town. Stops about 3 blks. from the Moore. You can buy yor tickets from the driver.

<Content>great location, clean rooms We stayed in June for 3 nights. It is definitely a no thrills place but the room we had on the fourth floor was massive, with a new carpet, comfy bed, clean sheets, walk in warbrobe and a sink. The toilet and shower room were across the coridoor. They could have done with a refurb but shower pressure was great and they were clean.It is really close to Pike Place and pretty much every attraction is in walking distance (depending on how far you fancy walking). The decor is alittle on the dull side but nothing to really bother about. Staff were really helpfull and friendly. Location is fairly safe (we didn't have any problems) but Seatlle does have its fair share of crazies but they are pretty harmless.The bar next door is one you would not normally go into if you were in your home town but we popped in for a cheeky cider or five and ended up chatting to most of the locals who were really cool, even if a little rough around the edges!

<Content>good for the money We stayed in The Moore in May, 2007 for 2 nights.It was o.k. for the money.The desk people were very friendly and helped us in any way.It is an old hotel, clean, the bathroom was in our room very small.They gave us the room we asked for, topfloor with the view to the water. Very nice, but in the morning you have the traffic.We would not book in summer. No A.C.!Situation: 2 blocks from the market and 2 blocks to the downtown shops. Perfect.2 facts we didn麓t like. - Boeing : 45 min busride, 1 hall with poor pieces, 2 videos, 1 was really poor, busride to the factory. 0.5h on  a platform to look down  Really: NOT TO DO - the bar in the Moore: rough. The elder lady was nice, but the  next evening, the younger ( not young ! ) one, very unpleasant!!The MOORE is good for the money, but NOT in summer.Rh.

<Content>Good Belltown budget option The Moore is nothing fancy, but it provides clean, spacious accomodations within spitting distance of Pike Place Market. Folks could complain about the decor, and rightfully so--the lobby and hallways are drab, the rooms are on the dim side--but it is a budget hotel after all, right? The furniture and carpet in our room looked newish, the beds and bathroom were clean, and I'm not sure what more you can ask for at the price.Speaking of which, prices are reasonable, with few rooms topping $100. We had a double queen room for Memorial Day weekend and paid only $92 per night. Rooms a few blocks away at the Westin and other similar chains were easily double that.Lobby staff was helpful and friendly, and there is a large, secure room for storing luggage after you've checked out. The crowd at the attached bar /restaurant was sparse, and the place put off a slightly depressing vibe. For a good breakast, hit the Crumpet Shop at the market or the Crocodile Cafe a few blocks up on 2nd.Overall, the Moore is a good budget option right near the market, waterfront, ferries, downtown buildings (check out the public library), and bus lines to all the neighborhoods. Can't say we'd want to stay in Belltown again (a bit sketchy at times--safe, but sketchy), but we'd definitely stay at the Moore if we did.

<Content>Great value, no frills but no surprises either This is a fantastic value for the money! I hesitated before trying it because of the negative reviews, but in my experience a 3.5 average TripAdvisor works for me, so I went for it. The only way one could be disappointed with this place is by having unrealistic expectations.I made my reservation directly through the hotel website, choosing the $52 European queen/single adult, which turned out to be Room 711 facing the water. I checked in on Saturday afternoon, after 2:30. The room itself, the sink and the linens were all perfectly clean in appearance, feel, and smell. The tap water tasted fine, although I let it run for a while before filling my glass since it's an old building. The decor is not worth mentioning but just to be complete here it is; hodgepodge cheap motel style, which by definition is unattractive, but it wasn't remarkably ugly. There were 3 sets of towels, 4 cups and 4 bars of soap. There's no clock, but you can ask for a wakeup call, or use the TV to keep track of time (reception wasn't great on all channels, but the news  weather were fine).The toilet across the hall was a little concrete cell, but it was clean. The full bathroom right around the corner was roomy, clean, and dry. I didn't use the sink because I had one in my room, but I had no problem getting plenty of hot water for my shower. The water pressure could have been stronger, but it was adequate. I never had to wait for the toilet or the shower, nor did I have people waiting after me to use them.There were some rowdy neighbors late Saturday night, which I expected, but I'm an easy sleeper so it didn't bother me. There was some street/city noise from outside, but nothing extraordinary if you've ever lived in an urban setting. My time in the room was spent either getting ready to go out or to sleep... I wasn't around to experience noise from the theater downstairs, so I can't comment on that.The homeless are very direct in downtown Seattle, but they're also quite professional so it's not that big a deal. My impression was that they were just exercising their right to ask me for money and in turn, they respected my right to say no.I really enjoyed my stay because it was no fuss, no frills, and no ugly surprises, so I could concentrate on other things. Even though it was inexpensive, I never felt, Oh no, I should have splurged on better accommodations! which has definitely happened to me before. I'm going to stay at The Moore again on my next Seattle trip.

<Content>Noisy but good value Felt like a weekend away from the wife and kids (more wife than kids to be honest- I know she wont read this !!) Chose Seattle to do this, as its within easy reach of my hometown Vancouver.Decided on the Moore Hotel,downtown as I'm both thrifty and poor and on reading previous reviews, seemed to suit my budget. Also as I was staying only one night-how bad could it be.On first look at the place from the outside ,I knew it wasnt going to be Buckingham Palace.The lobby is pretty spartan,the desk clerk on duty pretty friendly-one guy in front of me at check inwas turned away as place was full-so book ahead.Was pleasantly surprised by the room-spacious,and clean.No frills,no shampoo etc one bar of soap for all your needs.The mattress felt more like a water bed than a spring one and I almost seemed to touch the floor as I hopped on it.Ok so125 kgs will do it-but crikey some of those bed springs had surely seen better days.Ah now for some TV-but wait no remote-125 kgs jumping up and down to change channels,is not on.A trip down to reception to enquire as to whereabouts of saidremote-shrug of shoulders-our guests take them home you know set TV to CNN for duration of my stay.Off to Pike Place market-a short jaunt from the hotel-fantastic location-a few dubious characters around,but you find that in any major city.Parked right across the road in a place offering a spot for only $5-had to move my car that night to see De La Hoya/Mayweather fight at local sports pub-on return garage was full-now what ? no problem-park on the street for free-after 6 pmand Sunday all day free.Saturday evening and I'm winding down-Seattleites are winding up-the noise level rises to a crescendo-its now 2 a.m.A water pipe ( a prominent celing to floor fixture) in the room,not to be outdone,comes to life with a gurgle and splutterand keeps this up until 5. a.m an hour after the Seattlitesdecide its time to go home.I nod off into a fitful sleep.Something about this hotel though-somehow its quaintand pleasant in an obscene kind of way.Was almost sorry to leave-or was it teh thought of another Monday at the office looming large ? Give this place a go-just catch up on sleepbefore you do.

<Content>quirky, great value This is a great hotel if you don't mind some general quirkiness, a little bit of inconsistency style- and quality-wise, and fewer amenities than you might find at a more upscale hotel.I stayed in one of the suites...it was very clean, well furnished, interesting original fixtures. Why I intend to stay here next time I'm in Seattle:1. Awesome location, especially given the price;2. Unusual, fun, kind of faded, funky style; 3. Great, friendly, helpful staff: knowledgeable about restaurants, buses, etc.; 4. Wonderful coffee kitty corner to the hotel (Caf茅 D' arte);5. The suite was big, clean, and comfortable. What to know before you stay here:1. My kitchenette could hardly be considered functional. There was a little stove, fridge, and sink. Entire contents of kitchen utensils: one pot, one pan, one spatula, place settings for 3 people.Yes, that's it. I needed to buy a knife for my fruit in the morning. I didn't come to Seattle to cook in my hotel, but the kitchenette may as well not have been there, for its usefulness. (It was even hard to make tea, believe it or not!! And I'm pretty good at improvising with less-than-perfect culinary situations.)2. Controlling the heating in the room is not entirely up to you, youhave to fiddle with the radiators (sometimes rather hot) and then balance what is coming out of them with the cool air coming into youropen windows. 3. Bring your own clock, there's none in the room. 4. But there is a decent hair dryer.5. The lower floor rooms might be noisy because of the theater. My impression, walking up the stairs of the hotel during a concert, was that the noise seemed a bit bad for the first two floors and much better by the fourth. I was on the fifth floor, no noise problems. Would I stay there again? Yes!! Despite the quibbles, I loved the hotel and staff, and I would stay here anytime.

<Content>Good value My husband and I stayed at the Moore for 3 nights while attending a professional conference in Seattle. The hotel lobby is pretty spartan, but the front desk staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful throughout our entire stay. There is one free internet terminal in the lobby, but we did not use it. Unlike many similar hotels I've stayed in, the elevator at the Moore is modern and pretty speedy, though small. Our 7th floor room (714 - single queen bed) was clean and comfortable, with a nice view of Puget Sound over the rooftops of neighboring buildings. We enjoyed watching the ferries come and go. Amenities were minimal (no clock in the room, no toiletries beyond basic soap, poor TV reception) but we felt safe and comfortable for our entire stay. The building has been renovated, but historic touches, like original solid wood doors and old-fashioned brass keys, remain. Lack of water pressure and temperature regulation in the shower are my biggest complaints. We didn't have any problems with noise. The location was excellent; within easy walking distance of the convention center and major hotels where our conference was located and major attractions such as Pike Place Market. The neighborhood felt reasonably safe. We arrived by train and found it easy to hop on a city bus that took us almost to the door of the hotel. The bus ride was free because it was within Seattle's downtown fareless area. Overall, we were very satisfied with the Moore.

<Content>Not pleased. Stayed in the corner suite on the 7th floor. Room was nice from the walls up, but the floor squeaked horribly, everywhere. We had not been informed of the no guests rule when I made the reservation--only the people sleeping in the room may enter it. Definitely the kind of information you want before making a reservation. The people at the desk when we checked in and out were nice, but the night man was AWFUL. My roommates got on the elevator at the same time as someone in another room who had brought a guest. The night man stopped the elevator to badger those people, and couldn't get the elevator restarted, resulting in my roommates having to climb the 7 flights of stairs (while one of them was still recovering from a bad back injury). BUT THE WORST THING OF ALL was when the night man took one of my friends to be a drunk and refused to rent a room to him. My friend has cerebal palsy, and happened to be the headliner at the Moore Theater that night. Overall, it was a bad experience.

<Content>...Great value, great location!... We looked for a long time to try and find a reasonably-priced hotel for the 4 nights we would be staying downtown. As you might imagine it is very expensive to stay downtown Seattle. In fact the West Coast has a much higher cost-of-living than Milwaukee. We checked out chain hotels, discount travel sites, and bed-and-breakfasts 鈥?but ultimately it was a travel guide (Frommer鈥檚 2005) that suggested The Moore Hotel. It鈥檚 2 blocks from the Public Market and sits on a main street (2nd ave) 1 mile from the train station. It鈥檚 3 blocks southeast to the West Lake bus tunnel and there are literally dozens of cafes / clubs / and shops in every direction. We walked from the Amtrak station to the Hotel with our luggage when we arrived; and we walked from the Hotel to the bus station when we left - ideally situated for use of public transportation.We opted for the $55/night room which has no bathroom (鈥檈uropean style鈥?. This was half the rate we found even at most 鈥榙iscount鈥?chains. The bathroom was about 10鈥?from our room and we had our own key - so even though it was not a 鈥榩rivate鈥?bathroom, it was never inconvenient. The picture on the Moore website is not one of the european style rooms - ours was much smaller.The hotel was built around the turn of the [20th] century so there鈥檚 a lot of historic details that make it an exciting place to stay - tall ceilings, lots of windows, exposed woodwork, wide hallways. And most (if not all) of the 7 story hotel has been refurbished with new carpeting, fresh paint and retiled floors. In fact, the room we were in had brand new lamps, bed and TV. There is also a phone in each room (dial 鈥?鈥?to get out) and basic cable. The only negative observations about our room were that the sink (all rooms have sinks) had no hot water pressure and Harmonie thought there should have been a full-length mirror and there was no clock.We were on the 7th floor - room 711 to be exact - and were afforded a great view of the Puget Sound and downtown Seattle. I鈥檒l upload some movies when I have some extra time so you can get a feel for the layout. I would highly, highly recommend staying here if you鈥檙e ever in Seattle - and ask specifically for room 711 as some of rooms are in-facing (there鈥檚 a kind of a 鈥榗ourtyard鈥?space running up the center of the hotel so that in-facing rooms can open to the fresh air鈥?but it鈥檚 not a pretty view) and some of the south-facing rooms are on an alley.There is also 1 public-use internet terminal and wireless access in the lobby. The workers were very helpful with suggestions and they provide a big rack of literature for tourist-y things-to-do. The clientele seems quite mixed, with a lot of younger / international travelers as well as some older. I didn鈥檛 see any families. There is no pool or arcade, but there is an adjoining lounge/bar and theatre (which was, unfortunately, playing 鈥楢nnie鈥?while we were there) which gets touring bands every now-and-then. Also there鈥檚 no breakfast or coffee. There is also an elevator for those that don鈥檛 like walking up seven flights of old-timey stairs.So, once again - the Moore Hotel comes highly recommended.

<Content>Between Moore or Less, Less... The Moore appealed to my friend and I because it was in downtown Seattle and was, by far, the most bang for our buck. At $70 a night in the downtown area, we didnt expect much but after reading the reviews, we looked forward to seeing the charm of a well-taken-care-of hotel from yesteryear. We didnt find what we were looking for.Our room was a sloppy mix of one picture of a skyscraper, furniture from an office in Hawaii in the 80's and an awful lamp that had a crack on one side. Although I craned my head out of the window and got a magnificent view of downtown, I tried not to open it that often due to the baddraft coming in. We had no shampoo for the shared bath down the hall. One of the toilets had a problem and you had to push a button inside commode to flush it. And if we hadnt had a small desk fan in the room for quiet noise, we would've heard everything downstairs. We were SEVEN floors off the street. As we wandered the hallways, we found that there was nothing charmingabout the hotel other than its old fixtures. The whole place is in dire need of plants, pictures and color.Parking was an absolute nightmare; THIS HOTEL HAS NO ARRANGEMENTS WITH ANY OF THE PARKING GARAGES OR LOTS. It was every man for himself and more than slightly frustrating. Although the older front desk clerk kindly explained the procedures, I found it very inconvenient to have to get up at 7am or 8am and run down to pay for the parking after already paying for it overnight.The Moore did have something going for it: a very awesome location. Only a couple of blocks from Pike Place Market and anything else downtown. That was about it, however.Good price? Yes. Good location? Absolutely. Worth it? No.

<Content>Even Better The Second Time This is my second review for the Moore Hotel, having stayed here last year for the same conference and having written rave reviews then. Everyone already knows - don't expect fancy. Expect a great price and a great location. Where else can you stay two blocks away from Pike Place Market and in the middle of a free bus zone for under $75 a night for a single? Oh, and did I mention that you can catch the #194 bus for $1.25 just 1.5 blocks away and get to the airport faster than in a taxi?To update last year's comments:1) The hotel is now completely non-smoking.2) Free wireless in the lobby, and a computer with free internet access for those without laptops.3) This year I had room 500 - larger and brighter than the room I had previously. The bathroom even had stained glass windows (not real, but hey). Enough hot water to keep me happy. Tv reception still sucked but I didn't watch it except to check the weather. I'm not in Seattle to watch tv.2) The hotel staff is always polite, warm, friendly and so full of knowledge that they should write their own guidebook. They must get asked the same boring questions over and over again, and yet I witnessed them answer them again and again, very nicely, with as much info as they could think of. I don't know if I'd have the same patience.Examples: My flight out of Seattle didn't depart until 9 pm. They let me stay an hour later beyond the check out time, no charge, and held my luggage until I came back at 5:30 pm (in NYC, they charged $4 / per piece to hold it). Robert remembered me from last year, and as I was picking up my luggage, he went online, checked the bus schedule for me WITHOUT ME ASKING HIM TO and let me know, The bus is coming in 6 minutes! Go! I was able to catch it.I love the Moore Hotel, and if I'm on a budget and I'm in Seattle, this place is my #1 choice.

<Content>Not Bad For The Price Given its central downtown location and low price, the Moore is a very good value for a two-star. For the price, it's not fancy but adequate, clean, and roomy. The elevator and hallways are small and rather dingy but the rooms are fine. Beds are good, TV has sufficient channel selection, telephone, bathroom normal size with adequate motel-type towels/face cloths, soap, no shampoo, etc. There's no air conditioning, but there's a small fan in the room that was barely sufficient. Being from a rural area, we didn't find the street noise to be bad at all and we were on the front of the hotel facing 1st. Ave. It's about what you'd expect for a city but not objectional - running the fan for some white noise helps. We would definitely concur with other reviewers that an upper floor (5 or higher) is definitely recommended. They have free internet service in the lobby as well. The staff was not overly helpful or friendly but provided acceptable service. The best thing was it's central location to Pike Market, good restaurants, and all the downtown sites within the free bus ride area.

<Content>A Seattle Gem I recently visited the Moore Hotel with my family for the purpose of doing some sightseeing and to take in a couple Mariner baseball games. I booked a couple rooms for a long weekend, having stayed at the Moore previously on recommendations from friends. My family completely enjoyed their stay. There are three things about the Moore Hotel that make it a hotel I highly recommend - the character, the location and the value.The Moore is one of Seattle's more historic hotels with the charm of a bed and breakfast. Though an older building, it does not lack in comfort or amenities. Rooms are extremely generous in size. They easily accommodate two queen beds and the 12 foot ceilings allow large windows and wonderful views of the historic neighborhood. The finishes have been recently remodeled and the rooms are comfortable and clean. The hotel staff is personable, polite and accommodating. They make you feel like you are spending a weekend in their home, rather than in a hotel in a major city. A small lobby with marble floors and cozy sitting area for internet access lends to the bed and breakfast atmosphere.The hotel is located two blocks up from Pikes Place Market and two blocks north of the central shopping district. Its in an ideal location for easy walking to high end shopping or laid back cafes, boutiques and restaurants. There is plenty of parking in nearby garages or lots. The free downtown bus stops nearby and we felt very safe walking after dark from baseball games.And finally the value. The rates are unbeatable in a downtown location. You can spend two and three times as much in a nearby national chain hotel. That says it all.The Moore is a great choice for a comfortable, economical stay in the heart of downtown Seattle.

<Content>Don't overlook the Moore Is it spartan and dated: charmingly yes! So for the traveler who appreciates a clean, classic hotel in a prime, downtown Seattle location, this is for you. We've twice chosen the Moore for a pre-cruise stay with our kids in a suite of two conjoined rooms seperated by the bathroom. It's right downtown, so there is typical noise from trucks/sirens; but the beds were comfortable and showed no sign of bugs as others claimed. My only caution is to use the same ordinary caution outside as you would in any urban area after dark. The staff is incredibly cool, accomodating and provide free internet access in the lobby to check email, etc. I have recommended this hotel to like minded frugal friends and look forward to the next time we visit Seattle for another stay at the Moore.

<Content>The rudest people ever - dont stay!!!!!! Despite the fact that this could be a very cool hotel, the place sucks. The front desk, one of the nights we were there, was run by one of the rudest people I have ever met. I will not name him, but when we had a problem with our room, he was extremely rude and would not hear our issue. Very, very dissapointed.

<Content>Bed Bugs! My boyfriend and I stayed here from Sept 2-5. We usually stay at the Springhill Suites Marriott, but decided to go the budget route. A co-worker recommended this hotel knowing I wouldn't mind the lack of amenities (bring your own soap etc.), or the poor shape it's in. I have to say I wish I'd stretched the budget.The first night was fine, likely because we were drunk when we went to bed so we didn't notice anything.The second night I was pulling down the covers and crawling around on my pillow were 2 BED BUGS! I had booked 2 beds for more space so we thoroughly inspected the other bed and slept in that one. The next morning we saw another bed bug crawling around on the wall next to the bed we just slept in. We took our dead bed bugs downstairs and spoke with Mike (the manager). He was apologetic and claimed this was the first he'd heard of bed bugs in the Moore. We were booked to stay a third night, but were planning on going elsewhere. Mike said he'd help us out with the bill and find us another room so we decided to stay.The third night we came back at around 2ish. The night guy assigned us a new room on the 5th floor. We dragged everything to the new room, inspected the beds, unpacked, returned the other key and went back upstairs to finally go to sleep. As I pulled down the covers to go to bed I saw another bed bug crawling along the sheets. This time when we killed it it exploded with blood so it had obviously made a meal out of someone. We packed up all of our belongings again, called a cab, checked out (at 3:30am), and went to stay at the Holiday Inn Express.This place is a nightmare! (and I'm not even a squeamish person)!

<Content>Can't beat the price if you like to rough it. The best part of the hotel was the staff. I enjoyed sitting in the lobby watching the goings on. Interesting and nice people.They have a computer set up in the lobby for you to use as you wish for free. I was able to check emails.I booked the hotel because of the reviews on Trip Advisor. I was prepared for anything. I booked it because I did not want to spend 170 and up for an overnight before a cruise. You enter a small lobby with a few chairs to comfortably sit in, and one person working at the desk. A 2nd person is usually in the office next to the desk. Check out when parking is free on the streets before you pay 10 dollars for about 10 hours of parking in the lots. I think we could have saved 10 dollars if we read the signs.They are extremely nice and helpful. I can not say enough about how much I enjoyed them. You then take an elevator to your floor. When the elevator door opens, you start to giggle. I can't believe I booked this hotel.I hope you have a sense of humor, or don't expect much. Expect the worst for ambience.The hotel is old. Very old. The walls have been painted over in a very dark color, along with almost black colored carpeting in a wide hallway. You get the feeling of entering an old dormitory at an old, and I stress OLD, school . You walk down the depressing hall to the door (which has one real key even if you have 4 people in the room). You leave the key at the front desk when you leave if others might need it to get in.We stayed in a 2 queen bed room. There were 4 of us.The bed was comfortable enough. The decor was 1944 bland.There was no place to put anything down in the bathroom, like a counter. The toilet was so close to the wall on its left that your butt hit the wall if you sat down. You had to sit more to the right. The flusher hit the wall, so they cut a hole in the wall to be able to flush the toilet. The shower was fine. Fat people could not use the facility here. Not in my room.There is no screen in the window and no air conditioning. We left the window open all night (birds could have flown in as there were many), and traffic noise went on. I had no problem sleeping, but others could not stand the sound of traffic. I was exhausted and crashed with no problem.Staying near Pikes Market means you are in the run down part of town. I would prefer to stay in a nicer section. I did not realize how scary it could be.You are literally a 5 minute walk from the Market, and a block or 2 further to the waterfront.It is all downhill, so remember you need to walk back up again.During the day it was ok. We walked past a lot of scary people. I would not go out at night. I did get up earlier than the rest of the group, and since I had no place to watch tv without disturbing them, I went downstairs. They told me there was a McDonalds that opens at 630am. I walked there. about 3 blocks.I met all the drunks in recovery while I bought my coffee. Starbucks opens at 7. I brought the coffee back to the hotel and sat in the lobby, comfortably reading until about 930 when others got up.Seattle seems to be the most expensive city in the country. I don't think you will be murdered if you stay here, but I think I would prefer to stay at the airport the next time I overnight for a cruise. Or in a nicer neighborhood.If you walk in the opposite direction from your hotel you come to a really nice (expensive) section with Nordstroms, and all sorts of expensive fancy stores. A nice area. Way too expensive to stay there.There is a steak house across from the hotel (on the corner) that I really wish I had a chance to visit. It was Argentina beef and I remember that being awesome when I had it in the old days. I bet it is good.

<Content>budget place with character No frills, but clean, unique, and in the city center. The Moore Hotel is in an old building with a marble entryway and lobby. We stayed in rooms with private bathroom inside the rooms, but European style shared bath rooms are also available. The rooms we stayed in had wooden doors, and the bathtubs inside had feet like old-style bathtubs, though these also had shower connections.The rooms were clean and well-maintained, though there was no air conditioning. Windows open onto the street, which means that there's some noise from the street. Staff was friendly and willing to answer questions about things to do in the city.We compared notes with some folks staying at a local youth hostel and found that our private rooms in the Moore Hotel were about the same price. Since this is one of the least expensive places to stay in the city, I would recommend it to anybody looking for budget accomodations with old-style character. Most of the major tourist attractions in downtown Seattle are within walking distance. We found the neighborhood to be safe.There's a single free Internet terminal in the lobby for those wanting to check their e-mail.

<Content>The Moore - location, location, location.... The Moore Hotel is an older building, yet scrupulously cleaned and maintained. The staff were very helpful and courteous. The prices were great. However, its chief advantage is its location. At the corner of 2nd St. and Virgininia, it is only two blocks from Pike Place Mkt! It is also within easy walking distance of the Convention Center area. One block either way puts you on major city bus lines to connect to the stadiums to the south, or the Space Needle to the north. Airport transportation via the Shuttle Express vans drops you off/picks you up at the door of the moore for a great price. Two cruise lines dock at the waterfront directly below the Moore, but HAL and RCL dock closer to the Pioneer Square area. We stayed two nights pre-cruise, and two nights post-cruise at the Moore and felt it was a bargain. I would advist to request the upper floors, as street noise was noticeable in our room on the fourth floor. Also be aware that there is no air conditioning, but this was not a problem at all during our stay in August, 2006. If you want luxury and pampering this is not the place for you. However, for a clean room at a great price and in a great location, the Moore is the place. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Good value We stayed here for 1 night in August and it was a good deal. We saved money staying in one of their shared bath suites. Convieniently, the room had its own sink. The room was clean but bare of any decoration. The shared bath was a little uncomfortable to use. You had to walk up a tiled step before getting into the tub and there were no bath matts. There was no space near the tub to hang a towel. We shut the window in the evening because of the noise from the street but when we turned on the fan it was even louder and I had to sleep with earplugs. This was actually not too big of a deal.The staff was very nice and helpful. They recommended a nearby grocery store for late night sweets.Being able to walk to Pike Place Market, which took about 5 minutes, helped us out because we had limited sightseeing time in Seattle.To sum it up, the room was uninspiring but for the location and price it was worth the 1 night stay.

<Content>No-frills, but you can't do better for the money! Loved it. My boyfriend had stayed at the Moore Hotel 6 years ago on a cross-country trip, so when he suggested that we stay there on our recent trip to Seattle, I let him take care of our vacation plans. We took public transit ( MT194 / $1.25) from SEATAC, which lets you off 3 blocks from the hotel - an easy walk. This place is fantastic for the money if you don't require a lot of extras. They offer shared and private baths (the private baths go pretty quickly), and we tried out each. Even the shared bath option gives you a sink in your room. The hotel feels much like a hostel at first - it's old and not in the best visual condition, the hallways are a little dark, the elevator only holds a couple of people, and the doors to the rooms require *gasp* actual KEYS! The neighborhood is a little gritty, but we never felt unsafe at any time. It is a highly trafficked area, so you're seldom wandering about by yourself. Once inside the room, it's a pretty bare bones setup, but everything was super clean, functional, we had a fantastic view of the water, and the building is constructed like a prison (thick plaster walls), so we never heard a peep from our neighbors. The close proximity to just about everything is amazing - we walked to Pioneer Square (~25 minutes), Safeco Park (~35 minutes), Pike Place Market (less than 5 minutes), and took a quick bus ride over to the Seattle Center. This place is central to everything you'll need to explore Seattle efficiently and thoroughly.If you're into fancypants-type accomodations and need a lot of catering to, this place is not for you. There are no clocks in the room, no pictures on the wall, you may/may not get a mirror in your room, but the place is well worth the money that you'll save, and the service that we received from everyone working there was 5-star. They definitely have a lifelong customer in my guy and myself. The Moore Hotel is located smack on the border of Belltown, which is loaded with great eats, great bars, and tons of twenty/thirty-something hispters. For food, check out Le Pichet, Dahlia Lounge, Mama's Mexican Kitchen, OHanas, and Caffe D'Arte for awesome coffee/teas (skip Starbucks/Tully's). For entertainment, the Virigina Inn is a nice place to grab a beer, while places like Lava Lounge, Shorty's Coney Island, and The Whiskey Bar are more chaotic, but still good fun. The Palace Kitchen is a great late-night option, and they serve free pistachios at the bar.

<Content>Quirky and Friendly Place to Stay I was worried when I got there...it was an hour or two before check in, but the desk staff made it seem like they didn't have my registration. This was after e-mail contact and a phone call with my credit card. They wanted me to come back for a 3:00 check in. They stored my luggage and the hotel is within walking distance to EVERYTHING downtown, so it wasn't a big deal. When I got back at 3 though, I don't think my original room was ready yet, but they gave me a room on the 6th floor on the side street (above the theatre, perhaps?) No view, but the side street allowed me to have the window open all night (no air conditioning- it's alright!)That being said, this is an awesome hotel with friendly staff and people staying there, and it's right on the edge of Belltown and Downtown, so the location can't be beat. A car is not needed. Walking and busing got me everywhere I needed to go! I travelled solo (29-year-old male) and felt completely safe everywhere I went, but it you are a nervous traveller, this might not be the place for you. Rooms were simple, the age of the building gave it some character. Appreciated the fan in the room- wouldn't have slept as well without it. I would stay again next time in Seattle!

<Content>Wow!!! The Moore SO exceeded our expectations!! People seem to love or hate it. We did reserve one of the suites, which we're guessing might have been in better shape than the standard rooms, b/c otherwise I can't imagine such complaints as I see here. It was clean, stocked with bathroom basics (which i did not expect, given the no-frills descriptions), the room was huge, the location excellent. Given that it includes shared-bath rooms, there were some hostelers (tho the desk clerk noted they get the good hostelers b/c they require a credit card deposit), but also other middle aged and older couples. Staff was great and gave great restaurant recs. One item to note: the hotel is over a theatre, and when a band was performing, it was loud, even up on the 5th floor! However, the front desk told us most acts are over by 10, which is what we experienced. We will stay nowhere else in Seattle now (if we can get that suite)!

<Content>We won't stay anywhere else! RE: review of the MooreIts a little wordy but it speaks to the character of the Hotel and the people who run it.First we had never heard of the hotel but wanted to find a place for a night that was close to interesting city life (not really spent anytime in Seattle before) and was relatively inexpensive (budget) and also a place that was in an area where we felt safe to explore as well as one that was safe and clean to stay in. When my wife called the hotel number she got Bob on the other end, he absolutely was the reason that we decided to book a night at the Moore, in one phone call Bob answered every question she had and made her feel at ease about all her concerns (as listed above), still we thought that the price (for what he said on the phone about the area etc) was too good to be true. We arrived on the evening of July the fourth and Bob was working the desk, after meeting him we knew that he wasn't acting on the phone, VERY helpful and personable, every question again he answered and we were relieved and impressed. The room was great, very clean, quiet, it was everything we were hoping for. As we were there for only one night we didn't get to explore much but we felt like if we were to return that the Moore Hotel was for sure the place we would base out of next time.  So we left the next day to camp in Oregon for a week'ish, we decided though to cut the camping short by a night and head back to the Moore to see more of Seattle, we were all excited feeling comfortable heading back to Seattle knowing that our nights stay was not a concern at all. So as if I wasn't impressed enough with the Hotel and its staff they went one step farther, as we pulled up to the Hotel after an 8 hour drive I see Ray Davies on the marquee for a show at the theatre that night, being a hobby musician I thought I would see about getting a ticket as the rest of the family wanted to walk around and shop, the manager of the Moore Hotel overheard me in the lobby and said that if I left my name with Bob that he would leave me a ticket for the show, this is right after I found meter parking right outside the front door of the hotel!!, I almost went and bought a lottery ticket I was feeling so lucky.  Anyway a long story short, the show was great, I had a blast seeing Ray and being that I enjoy old buildings I was feeling very fortunate to be seeing the show (at no charge!!! things like this don't happen to me) in a theatre with such rich architectural character and history, it was an evening to remember, and it was all thanks to the Moore Hotel Mgt and staff. So big Thanks! to the Moore Hotel staff for the generous hospitality of the free ticket, and for the worry free couple nights stay we had, when in the area again we will definitely return to the Moore.If you want the perfect balance between cost, location and quality, absolutely stay here.-Russ Saskatoon, Sk, Canada

<Content>Never Again. Terrible Experience Awful one night stay. (Planned on staying for 3) Dirty, old, hot. (no A.C.) Met 2 policemen who suggested we move to a safer place in town. Price isn't everything. Spend a little more and get lots of advantages.

<Content>excellent bargain I stayed at the Moore for 2 nights recently and as most other reviewers posted, it was great for the price.ROOMS: The Moore offers both rooms with private baths and rooms with shared baths. You'll save about $15-20/night if you take a room with a shared bath. I was a single traveler and took a room with bath for only $65/night. The same room for two people in it would have been ~$80/night.You won't find a lot of amenties, but at this price, I didn't care. Like there was no shampoo or even glasses for water, but this was a very small inconvenience compared to all of the other great pluses (price, location, etc.).The rooms themselves were very clean, if a little worn in places like the bathrooms. Also, they were fairly large, so you won't feel like you're living in a closet.LOCATION: It can't be beat. It's between Pike Place and Belltown. The walk to each is about 3-5 minutes, if even that. TRANSPORTATION: From the airport buses (174 and 194), it's a 5-minute walk with luggage. You're also close to a ton of bus lines. I was able to save money and not get a car because of the great location. I took buses to the University district, Madison Park, Fremont, and Capitol Hill. All of these bus stops were about a 5-minute walk away as well.INTERNET ACCESS: There is one computer terminal in the lobby you can check email from for free. Free wireless internet is also available, but only in the lobby. STAFF: I found all of the staff I interacted with to be extremely helpful and friendly. CHECKOUT: Checkout is a little on the early side at 11AM, but I was able to secure a late checkout (noon). On busier days, I still think they would let you have a late checkout of 11:30AM.

<Content>Avoid like the plague I did not feel safe at this hotel. Couples may feel more comfortable but I could see the shuttle bus driver was not impressed by my hotel of choice.I was booked in here for 4 nights [ a single female traveller]. When I got there they told me that I could only have three nights with an en suite and the other night I would have to move room and share a bathroom. Totally unacceptable as a lone female. When I complained they told me tough move elsewhere. Which I did at 6.30 the next morning [I arrived at the Moore at 10 pm too late to find somewhere else]. I moved to the Inn on Queen Anne which was slightly more expensive but had a kitchenette, friendly staff and a much better vibe.

<Content>The Moore was more than we expected We stayed here before a cruise last week. The location is great, the price is right, and the rooms are decent. The staff was very helpful. If you want to pay $250 a night for a few hours in a room go ahead, but I would saty here again in a minute. The bathroom was fine. Small TV, but your not there to watch TV. Don't expect the Ritz, but you will do fine. You can keep your luggae in a closet while you chaeck out Seattle before the cruise.Take a Taxi to the cruise. They will call the cab.Thanks Moore Hotel!!

<Content>Good location, but get an inside room The Moore is an old place in a good section of downtown, between Seattle Center  Pike Place Market. Our first room was on the street  was a bit noisy (there's no A/C, so we had the windows open). We switched the next night to a courtyard room, but you still get some reflected traffic noise. The courtyard rooms surround the Moore Theater, so you might not want to stay there on a concert night (unless you don't go to bed early). I'd still prefer this over the budget hotels near Seattle Center.

<Content>Love The Moore! Great Budget Accomodations  I have stayed at this place 3 times and its been awesome each time. If you like a place with character this is it. Its not luxurious by any means but it fits the bill if you are not looking to empty your wallet. Excellent base for exploring Pike Place Market, Belltown, Downtown, and Seattle Center..all are within walking distance.I found no stains or tears in my sheets and the staff was SUPER friendly and helpful. I love how the housekeepers fold the towels into swans...great little touch. The rooms are huge!Its old...but its got charm!

<Content>It all started at the Moore! As a solo Canadian traveling through Seattle for the first time I am so glad I ended up at the Moore Hotel! I'd been on the road for a bit and my credit cards were running low, about $70 left on my MasterCard. After being turned away from half a dozen downtown hotels I found myself in the lobby of the Moore. The front desk was understanding and set me up with the most affordable, safe downtown room I could ever dream of! I was able to get a huge basic room with beautifuly clean baths and washrooms down the hall. The location is perfect for the city sights and sounds and walking distance to everything. The Bar staff and regulars were very welcoming to a stranger, being a Chef, I soon realized I was in the after work hangout for the downtown service industry. What would be the chances of ending up in the place I'd be hanging out at if I worked and lived in Seattle?I have a couple Seattle trips planned for this year and there is no doubt where I will be staying. Falling in love with your city started at The Moore Hotel!Whistler, BC, Canada.

<Content>The Best Cafe in the World! I am experiencing the most peaceful and serene time off from work. My spirit has been lifted.  Our visit with Jayna was the best. It was raining when we landed at Sea-Tac, but by the time we loaded our luggage into the trunk of our rental car the sun was peaking through the clouds. The weather was cool, but when the wind blew it made the hair on your neck stand up. The Moore Hotel was nice. Our Room was on the 6th floor with a panoramic view of the Puget Sound. The room was clean and comfortable. If I could make a suggestion to the proprietor, it would be to put a small shelf in the bath room and a place to hang your robe behind the bathroom door would be nice. This hotel is in the heart of Downtown Seattle, a block east of Pike's Market Place and a block west of Nordstrom's. We spent a small fortune in parking, but all in all it was worth it. The Mariners swept the series with the San Francisco Giants. Barry Bonds hit a home run his first at bat. So did Ichiro.  Day 2Mike went to the ballgame with his brothers Randy and Steve for game two of a three game series. It was Gay Pride week in Seattle. Jayna and I exhibited our diversity and joined the festivities at the Fremont Street Fair. This is it's 35th year of celebrating the Summer Solstice. It was a large diverse group of warm bodies. Belly dancers, floats and naked men and women (sporting only body paint) danced through the streets raising awareness to the needs of low-income and the homeless community (the 6 foot tall stuffed penis got my attention). The fair is free but donations are accepted. Donations received directly fund Fremont Public Association (FPA). The fair was loaded with exhibits, art, crafts, musical entertainment and food. Jayna and I escaped the hot pavement and retreated to a Thai restaurant. I had the Cashew Chicken with vegetables and rice, YUM! Jayna had the Chicken Curry with noodles. Afterwards, we met Mike and his brothers at Ivars to say our goodbyes. Then Mike, Jayna and I took the ferry over to Bainbridge and headed towards Port Townsend. Day 3Jayna's friend Shannon was a life saver! Our reservation at the Water Street Hotel (WSH) was nearly lost. But Shannon was able to retrieve our room key before 6pm. Thank you Shannon! The WSH is very old. It was built in 1889 by EH Fisher. The Hotel offers a beautiful view of the Puget Sound, Mount Baker, the Cascade, and Olympic Mountains. It is in the heart of Downtown PT Historic District and within walking distance to shops, and restaurants. The festive spirit of Gay Pride week followed us up to Port Townsend. The WSH is above the Water Street Brewing and Ale House. The Ale House offered a masquerade/costume party on Saturday evening. The music was so loud you could hear hear it three floors up. The patrons partied until the early morning hours. The featured entertainer was DJ Ramiro. For breakfast we went to the Landing Restaurant. Jayna suggested the Baked Blueberry French Toast stuffed with Cream Cheese. Oh my Gawd! I highly recommend this one. Afterwards we walked out onto a pier and watched as boats docked. Then walked through all the shops downtown. The shops are all quaint and tastefully done. My favorite, was Maestrale. An eclectic collection of old and new. I found the cutest cobalt blue antique drawer pulls. ~Cute-Cute-Cute!~  That evening we ate dinner at the Fountain Caf茅. We had dinner salads with Honey/yogurt dressing and Taylor Gold Pears. Our meal was the most flavorful blend of Italian cheeses, noodles and chicken. Most people call this Chicken Fettuccini. I say it was the best I've ever tasted. For dessert we shared a Cr猫me Brule. Oh My Gawd! This is the best restaurant in the world. We had the best waitress, the atmosphere was delightful and the Art exhibit was colorful.  Day 4We checked out of the WSH, then went to visit Jayna's friend Joe. He is a Barista in uptown PT near Aldrich's Market. Joe makes a mean latte.Day trip with Jayna to Fort Warden and the beach. We hiked to a remote cliff face with a 500 foot drop. Scary! Then we took a long long walk along the beach. We laughed, talked and reminisced. It was a good day. We took Jayna back to her house and made the drive back to Seattle and then home. I miss her. Respectfully,A V O N Beauty Advisor/e-RepJoanie JensonKeep America Beautiful Buy or Sell AVON

<Content>Loved the Moore Hotel! I just got back from a five night stay at the Moore Hotel in Seattle. For $65 a night I paid it was an amazing deal! My room was on the 6th floor, and I had views of the bay. The room was large, clean and quiet, if somewhat dark, and the staff was friendly and helpful. the one drawback was the clawfoot tub in the bathroom had no decals or bathmat, so if you are not careful it can be a bit slippery. The front desk does not provide bath mats, so you may have to spend three or four bucks on one while you are there. The location is also really convenient, just a few blocks from Pike Place Market, and within easy walking distance of Pioneer Square and the main shopping area, as well as the location to catch tourist buses and cruises. Also, the Metro bus (which is $1.25 to $2.00 depending on the time of day) to and from the airport is just two blocks away. Would definitely stay there again when I go back to Seattle, and at those prices I can certainly afford to!

<Content>Good experience I stayed from 5th May to 13th May 2006 in room number 308. It was really good experience staying at Moore hotel. its in the center of downtown. almost all the big business centers and shops are at walkable distance..even we walked to see space needle. Pike place market and Seattle aquarium are also at walkable distance. I was there to attend a conference at washington state trade and convention center which is also at 10 min. walkable distance.Next thing is room are very clean and room servise is appreciable. staff is very freindly and helpful. the guy was no less than a guide and provided all information we wanted. then they have a wireless internet. if u have a laptop its gr8, else they have kept a computer system for internet.One of the thing i like most is it is completely non smoking.On the other hand, if they could provide breakfast it will be very useful, or just provide a coffeemaker or something..so that u dont have to go out for such things early in the morning.

<Content>Great location! I stayed at the Moore for 11 nights whilst on a conference in Seattle. It is in a great location - close to Pike Place Market and the major central tourist attractions are within easy reach.If you like luxury, you may be disappointed, but was lucky enough to get a room with a waterfront view and it was pleasantly furnished, clean and comfortable. Several of us stayed there and we were all happy with the value for money and service.

<Content>Great location, Great price We stayed at the Moore for two nights right after Memorial Day, in a standard room with 2 double beds and a private bath on the 7th floor (719). The room was huge, while sparsely decorated. The bathroom was average - small, and there was a large walk-in closet. There was no air conditioning, but that seems to be the norm in Seattle. The room was very clean - we could smell the cleaning supplies when we entered the room. The front desk service was great - they recommended great places to eat, order delivery, and get a shuttle to the airport. The free internet terminal in the lobby was also appreciated.The location is great - not only is it walkable to many attractions, but it's in the middle of the downtown free bus zone, so you don't have to walk if you don't want to.Our room was approximately $100 with tax per night. I'd stay there again.

<Content>Spartan accomodations, but not sleepless in Seattle! My friend and I stayed at the Moore for one night during the memorial day weekend. I booked a hotel in Seattle for the rest of the stay and just needed a hotel for the first night--which was difficult to find since all the hotels seemed to be booked on that night. So I found the Moore as a fluke through tripadvisor.com-- I did a search for hotels that were under $100 dollars a night in the downtown region and the Moore came up and ranked #15 of all seattle hotels. I read through the reviews and was a little nervous at first since some compared it to a hostel or sleazy motel. But I noticed those reviews were quite early and the most recent reviews were pretty favorable so I decided to book. Plus the night my friend and I arrived in Seattle we had to catch a show at the Crocodile Cafe--which was only 3 blocks away from the moore. When we got to the hotel, we observed how a couple in front of us were treated since there was a mix up with their reservation. apparently they reserved two queen beds with private bath, but since there was a glitch in the reservation system (that neglected to acknowlege that the two queen rooms were sold out) the person at the front desk offered the couple a room with 2 beds and a single that was connected together at a discounted price. When it became our turn to check in, he did the same for us except we got a room with 1 queen bed and 1 and twin bed. The person at the front desk was really nice and cordial.Now on to the actual hotel...The room was decently clean but no frills--lacked little amenities such as remote control. But I think the lobby had a free internet terminal and I saw a few people downstairs using wireless. Since the moore is located in the heart of Seattle's trendy Belltown neighborhood as soon as you step out of the moore, there's tons of bars and restaurants at your feet at night, and litlte trendy shops and salons to visit in the day. Pike Place Market is an easy walk as well. So it's not bad considering the price (esp with the 10 dollar discount) and convenient location, so it's definitely recommended for students or others on a budget.

<Content>Best budget hotel in Seattle? The other reviews seem to have it right - best part about this place is the location. Easy walking distance to everywhere. We were on the top floor, so we weren't kept awake by any street traffic, but I can't vouch for the lower rooms. Reception were friendly, and the price is great for Seattle.Only negative points were a dingy little bathroom and a fairly small lift, but who cares?

<Content>Surprising enjoyable stay! Of the 3 hotels I stayed at during my trip to Seattle and Vancouver, the Moore hotel was the least expensive but surprisingly the best. The room was bare-bones but comfortable. My 7th floor room was very quiet even with all the windows open. The immediate neighborhood was devoid of any homeless beggers. There's a guest computer and wireless internet in the lobby. A word of advice... be sure to lock the deadbolt on your door when you leave your room.Like the other reviewer, I walked to The Moore from the King Street Amtrak Station. Although walking isn't too bad, it is pretty far. I made the mistake of walking along 1st and then walking up Virginia which is an extremely steep hill. By the way, the hotel website is misleading. The picture that's shown is the Moore Theater which is not entrance for the hotel. The hotel is located on 2nd Ave in the middle of Stewart and Virginia. The sign for the entrance to the hotel is flat against the building so it's not visible while walking along the street. I reached the area at 11 at night and was totally confused on where the hotel was. Maybe I was just tired.By the way, most reviewers mention that this hotel is only a couple of blocks from Pike Market. While true, there is an extremely steep decline on Stewart or Virginia to get down to there. Save yourself the punishment on your knees by walking on 2nd Ave over to Pike Street to get to the market. If you want some good exercise, you can then walk uphill on Stewart to get back to the hotel. Also, I found that the majority of the market doesn't start opening up until 10am and then it takes them about 1/2 hour to setup. By 6pm, everything is pretty much closed.I apologize if this was already mentioned but you can find a coupon for this hotel at:(---)

<Content>Excellent if you are on a budget We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and had a European room. The room was large and clean and the bathroom was down the hall. It had just been painted so was as good as new.Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly and there was free internet access in the lobby.The hotel is situated a couple of blocks from Pike Street Market and the major shops, and about a 15 minute walk from the Space Needle. For the price you couldn't ask for anything better.

<Content>enjoyed the moore THis hotel couldnt be better placed and it was fantastic value for money. It was very close to Pike Place Market which is great and full of culture. It is not too far from the Space Needle and EMP plus downtown and shops. Our room had a view of the sound which was a lovely view. I was definately pleased with this hotel. It was centrally located, safe and clean and the bed was comfy. THe only thing I could find wrong, and even then it was not a big issue, was the bathroom was a little dull, but you dont go to seattle to spend each living second in the bathroom! The swans that they made from towels were great! One last thing, if you get the chance whilst in Seattle, go to Mt St Helens, you can get a greyline tour or you can do it by hiring a car. its fantastic!

<Content>Great Place for Family If you want a comfortable, affordable place to stay with your family while visiting Seattle, you can't beat the Moore. If you want the Ritz, make your reservations somewhere else.There were nine of us in our family group. Grandparents, children, ages 7 and 8, parents and aunts and uncles. We arrived on AMTRAK at 10:00 PM on a Friday night and walked all the way to the Moore Hotel. It was a weekend so there was plenty of activity on the streets and we felt perfectly safe. Lots of couples walking together.If it is night and your are a single woman, or it is raining I would suggest a cab. It is about a twelve block walk from the train station. A little bit more if you are taking in the Mariners or Seahawks. During the day we walked everwhere. Pike Street Market was just two blocks away, so you can get up early in the morning and head down to get a cup of coffee and watch everyone set up before the crowds arrive.Tully's and Starbucks one block away. I patronized the Starbucks in the morning for our coffee and cocoa and a few pastries. Friendly young lady working in there that remembered me each morning as I came stumbling thru the door.The Athenian at Pike Street serves an affordable family style breakfast. Also CJ's on 1st was a good family restaraunt. It was about 5 blocks from the Moore.The guys in our party found a large army surplus store a few blocks away on 1st.Seattle Center with the Space Needle and Science Center was a close enjoyable walk.We met people at the Moore who were walking up to 6th Ave to take in the jazz music.Beds were comfortable. Bathroom had plenty of towels and a good shower. We had two rooms to accomodate all of us. Room 424 had two rooms with a total of 5 beds. Windows aren't spotless, but they open so you can get a cool breeze. It was warm while we were there, not sure how warm the rooms would be if it is chilly outside.If you want lots of peace and quiet this might not be for you. Street was noisy till about 2 or 3 AM. We were all tired from our busy days so it didn't bother us. About 6:00 AM the city comes alive again.We had a small view of Elliot Bay from our room. Did not have a chair to sit in so we could look at the view. I did meet one gentleman in the elevator at 7 in the morning who was grumbling about having to feed the parking meter so early. Sounds like that is a Seattle downfall.Staff was very friendly and had our key ready for us when we would return from an outing. Only one key per room, so we left it with the front desk when we went out.I can't wait to go back! Even if I went back by myself as a single woman, I would stay at the Moore.

<Content>Moore Hotel is the greatest  This place is so so charming, quaint and friendly. Great location and you can't beat the price with a 10 foot pole. I love all the little shops on the block underpants, jewelry and toys, one stop shopping if you don't need anything so practical- and the nitelite bar downstairs is AWESOME!!!

<Content>Regular visitor to the Moore Hotel Okay, this is NOT a glam hotel, but you can't beat the location! There is no bellhop; the front desk service can be loveable, rude or hard to understand; and the water pressure isn't the greatest. That's the worst of it. What's so great about the Moore that I've visited and revisited and been a fan for nearly a decade now... the price and the location. I don't go to Seattle to sit in my hotel room, I visit to walk around, to shop, to drink coffee and to see the water. At the Moore, you have it all at your doorstep.When I first started visiting, the neighborhood was in desperate need of police surveillance at night. As a single female traveler, I could walk around and feel relatively safe and the front desk kept a good eye on their lobby and the comings and goings of their patrons. Now, the neighborhood immediately outside the door looks even safer and more options are available for shoppers, diners, beer and cocktail seekers than ever before.Best part - YOU ARE ONLY TWO BLOCKS FROM THE WATERFRONT. Request a 6th or 7th floor room facing the water and you'll enjoy a view that most visitors pay through the nose for. Walk to Pike Place in the morning, shopping at Pioneer Square in the afternoon, visit nearby Belltown at night. Walk everywhere. They'll hold your luggage for you either before your check-in time or after you've checked out but have a few hours to kill before catching your flight. Visiting the convention center - it's less than 10 minutes walk, grab coffee at the French Bakery at Pike's Place before you head into convention hell.Worst part - Parking - you have to pay, there are two lots on either side of the hotel or try the Bon/Macy's parking lot for something a bit cheaper. Oh, and they like to keep your key at the front desk - there is only ONE KEY available per room, so if you're sharing with someone but have different itineraries, make a habit of dropping the key off at the front desk. I would trust these people, I once left a drawerfull of clothes behind and they were kind enough to take care of them until I returned the next day, ashamed but extremely grateful.And if you've always wanted to be a bellboy, there are a couple of luggage carts that you can wheel your stuff about.

<Content>What a dump! The reviews on here are not always spot on but most times they come through. Not with the Moore. These reviews must be written by the owners or something because this place reminded me of something between a hostel and sleazy motel.The lobby is falling apart (like most of the building)the rooms are big, i'll give them that, but the bed sheets were torn and stained, horrible old mattress, pillows that me think it would be better if i laid my head on a brick. The place wasnt super dirty but it was not kept up. I realize its old but its just not worth it at any price.

<Content>Love it! I love the Moore Hotel! I have stayed there 3 times in the last 6 years and everytime was an great experience! The staff is friendly and is always willing to give you suggestions on places to go. It's just up the street from the Pike Place market which you have to visit even if you are only there for the day. Also very close to capital hill, the space needle, crocodile cafe, etc. All this and at an incredible price too. I will only stay at the Moore!

<Content>Great Place in perfect location! i must say that i was a little skeptical on such a place due to the price, in comparison with other hotels in the downtown area. man, was i wrong. very friendly staff, very helpful, and accomodating. building was very old, but very well upkept. only two blocks away from pike place market, four or five blocks from the shopping district, and the start of belltown (great restaurants and bars). would definitely encourage anyone looking for a great deal, and on a budget. will definitely stay again.

<Content>nice place I stayed at the Moore Hotel in 1996 and returned last year to find that not a lot had changed. It is very well placed in central Seattle and pretty much everything is walking distance. the rooms are clean, well sized and en-suites are available. when we stayed there the staff were very helpful and introduced us to the local shops and some great restaurants. the moore is excellent value for money.

<Content>Cheap Sweet Getaway for Young Couples My fiance and I stayed here over Thanksgiving weekend. He wasn't sure that I had found a deal and teased me all the way from Portland that I had found a dump. I have used trip advisor for work though, and most the reviews were good, so I went with it. We are young, and even if it was a total flop, it would have been a good experience. When we got to the hotel, the clerk, was quite the expert on the local night life, and gave us a map that he marked with all the local bars and walking distance. We had a great night on the town, and were able to leave our car next door since we had checked in around 7pm the night before ($15.00 for a full 24 hours!)this allowed us to venture out to Pikes Market, and walk down to Pioneer Square after check out. The area is not Posh by anymeans, and neither is the hotel, but it is a bargain, with some unexpected charm, such as marble stairs, red wood doors, clawfoot bath tubs, and thin, but decoratively folded towels. But if poor lighting can be seen as romantic mood lighting and you like a clean tub to bathe in with a bottle of wine and enjoy a lively night life without having to seem pretentious to fit in, then this is the place. For a poor young couple trying to pay for a wedding, and a newer car, this is the kind of place we can afford to go to every few months!

<Content>As good as claimed I booked a room at the Moore for two weekend nights thinking I would get one with a shared bathroom. Well, there were issues with the shared bathrooms (I never found out what they were) so the desk clerk gave me a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 7th floor with its own very small bathroom and a view of the city and Lake Union in the distance. It was very comfortable, warm and secure (which in Belltown is always an issue) and the location could not be better. I will definitely be back.

<Content>Awesome location Recently stayed at the Moore in Seattle. What a great location, blocks to the Market. Also about 3-4 blocks from the monorail that takes you to the Space Needle. The hotel could use a little updating, but the rooms were very clean, quiet and a great value. The staff was wonderful, very helpful and friendly. Would recommend to any wanting comfortable, clean accomodations on a budget in a very central location. Not for picky people, however.

<Content>Stay here!!! We stayed at The Moore for 3 nights- couldn't have had a better time. The building is old and extra charming, loved the staff, and the wireless network. Great location right next to the Pike Place market, the Moore Theater, and lots of cute little independant shops. Nice views and so cheap I couldn't believe it. The bar downstairs has some excellent decorations- check it out.

<Content>Okay place, cheap place. I stayed Moore for 3 nights.I was excited when I found this hotel from this website, sounded fantastic.Maybe that's why I was dissapointed when I stepped in the hotel. It's obviously a budget hotel, not so nice.Some of staff were not so nice like other comments say. But there was at least one guy who was helpful.I stayed queen single room with bath.The room was really large, but the bathroom was old and terrible since it has cracks on the really old tiles etc... and everything in bathroom is 100 years old. Water pressure was weak. Somehow, the furnitures in room are new, so that's good part.I asked room with view, and it had a good view, but comes with some street noise. Anyway, I wanted to save money while close to downtown, it's ok experience.

<Content>A few flaws but still preferable to HI Seattle The Moore Hotel is touted as a once grand hotel and serious emphasis must be placed on the 'once'. Although the lobby appears relatively modern, the internal decor/style of the rooms are reminiscent of the 1940s. Rooms are very basic to say the least, but you only get what you pay for and the Moore represents fair value. The TV in our room was damaged with poor sound quality and the bed slightly uncomfortable. Rooms do not appear to have any functioning heating or built in fan/cooler/heaters which is a bit of a drawback depending on when you visit. However the rooms were clean and the front desk staff incredibly helpful and welcoming. We even got a free upgrade to a room with a ensuite. Internet access is free in the lobby and the Moore's downtown location is good. Travellers considering staying at the mediocre Hostelling International Seattle should seriously consider staying at the Moore instead. The location is better,safer,cleaner and the price virtually the same if you were considering a private room at HI.

<Content>don't stay I stayed at the Moore Hotel 10/12-10/18. NO HEAT!! Owner refused to turn heat on (radiator) but for one night,staff said it wasn't worth to turn on for a few guests.If you don't care on comfort stay here, rented a room with a bath. Not much of a room, bathroom had no place to hang anything, no soap dish in small shower,thin towels, bed sheets had holes in them. Constant draft from the window,not child safe. Smell of urine in hallway. Noisy street,ify area.It is close to the market. If you think a summer stay would be better- no a/c. One star hotel one a good day.

The hotel is very old and the walls are paper thin, but the room is clean and you can open the windows for fresh air. Would stay here again.

<Content>Loved the Moore! We stayed for two nights (Sept 17 +18) while in town to see Dead Can Dance at the Paramount. Coming from Victoria on the Clipper it was $7 by cab (including tip) to the Moore. Check in was quick and front staff were very helpful! Our 7th floor room was charming and very clean. Water pressure was perfect but watch out for the shower - hot was cold and cold was hot - at least in our room. The hotel was quiet - we only bumped into a couple of groups in the hall and yes the noise on the street from the bar scene was noticable but close your window and you won't be bothered. The area is safe and really would you walk anywhere alone at 3 am? We found a coupon on the web for 10% off the already great price. Close to the Market, Monorail, major shopping, a 10 min walk to the Paramount - location cannot be beat. Belltown has many great placed to eat - Belltown Pizza, 2 huge slices and a soda for $7.91. For a late nite snack and a game of Connect Four or an early morning coffee try Nexxus - just 1/2 block to the north on 2nd ave. We are already planning our next trip to Seattle and can't wait to stay at the Moore again!

<Content>Great Location, Great Value My husband and I stayed at The Moore for 3 nights/4 days beginning on September 15th. The main purpose of our visit was to see a concert at the Paramount Theatre but we decided to add a couple of extra days to see Seattle. We found the hotel to be a great location to everything that downtown Seattle has to offer. Our room was a good size, clean and comfortable. Pike's Market, shopping and restaurants are all close by. It's true that the hotel does not have the frills of other downtown hotels but, as far as I'm concerned, getting some fluffier towels and free shampoo/conditioner is not worth an additional $150+ USD/night. Suggestions: Woodland Park Zoo (fantastic and worth the 10 minute bus drive out of downtown); Anthony's Pier 66 (excellent seafood restaurant on the waterfront) Enjoy your stay at the Moore!

<Content>Moore than I expected Our group was going on a cruise so we came into Seattle early to see the sights. I'd read about the Moore on Trip Advisor and decided to book 4 rooms for us. Everyone was delighted with the price of rooms and charm of this once grand dame. The staff was very helpful and friendly, Ed was a dear! Our rooms had all recently been renovated and were lovely. The beds were great. The location is great for being able to walk and see the sights of Seattle. No car needed. I can't remember the name of the coffee house we went to but it was accross the street to the right and about a half block down. By far the best Latte I've ever had! I will definately stay here again!

<Content>I'll Have Moore! My friends and I stayed at the Moore Hotel over a long Labor Day weekend and were very pleased. The location offers easy access to attractions, nightlife, restaurants, ferries, and shopping. I did not find the area unattractive in the least. Yes, there were eccentrics and homeless around, but I found that to be the case throughout Seattle.It is located in a very young area, and you may have trouble finding a bar with anybody over 30 inside. But again, that seemed to be true throughout Seattle. We had a nightcap one night at the neighboring Nite Lite Lounge, and enjoyed ourselves, even though it was a young crowd.The hotel is old but clean. I paid $286, including taxes, for four nights in a single room, and my friends paid $311 for a double. You can't beat that price for such a central location. The beds were very comfortable. Every day, the maid would pick up stuff of mine that was lying around and leave it neatly on the windowsill.My only complaint was with the bathrooms. I could not get my shower to deliver both hot water and good pressure, and the shower stall was extremely small. The toilet sometimes had to be flushed twice. Also, there was no plug for the bathroom sink, so I had to put a washcloth over the drain before putting my contacts in. My friends had one of the claw-foot tubs with shower curtain, and said they had no problems with the water. However, their toilet malfunctioned on our last day, and no one turned up to fix it. They were able to use the hall toilet, and the front desk offered to move them to another room, but they didn't want to bother and so just used the hall toilet.The front desk people were extremely helpful and friendly-can't praise them enough.We did not have the parking problems that others have encountered, partly because we stayed there over Labor Day weekend and street parking was free on Sunday and Monday. We had to get up early to move the car once, but we spent a total of $8 on parking the entire weekend, and one night we got a spot right in front of the hotel!

<Content>great find....you can't go wrong staying here.... We stayed at the MOORE for two non continuous nights and we were glad we did...the rates were the best in town and the hotel was as clean as a whistle....the help at the desk was great....Bob was especially wonderful and the best! Thanks Bob for alll your help while we were there. The manager, was also terriffic. I had a problem and he allowed me the privilege of sending a fax free of charge from his office. He couldn't have been nicer. The location of this hotel is great. Just a few blocks to Pike Street Market.. (BIG ATTRACTION IN SEATTLE) The rooms are big and the closet is emence. The hotel is not fancy but it is clean, quiet and safe and there is a computer available in the lobby which can be used free of charge and an elevator to take you to the upper floors. Rooms with or without a bath can be obtained. I would definitely stay here again. The city is great. The buses in town do not charge anything. Great restaurants and a fun place to visit and a great place to start off your vacation. We used the Clipper Boat/ferry Service and visited lots of close by places; San Juan Island; Victoria and Vancouver... you will not go wrong if you stay at the Moore. Read the history of the place...which is very interesting....I only wish I had time to visit the Theater next door...which I understand from the Manager/owner it is one of the oldest in the US. Smart ecconomical travelers will stay here who do not require the Marriot ambiance and/or do not want to pay the top prices.

<Content>More on the Moore There's not much more I can add to the other reviews, other than to say that our stay was equally satisfying. I used to live in Seattle so I didn't need travel help from the staff, but they were always pleasant over the phone and in person.I love the location because I could walk to Pike Place each morning and watch them set up the market. It's also great to be able to walk to Bell Town restaurants and the Space Needle.The room was funky and the hotel is a bit cavernous. We had a claw foot tub with a shower - the hot water was so weak that I never added cold when I took a shower - but it was just warm enough to be comfortable. We were serenaded awake each morning by seagulls - something that would not be as much of a problem if we'd had the window closed.But overall, it's a good place to stay and I would definitely stay at the Moore again.

<Content>Book the Moore Hotel The Moore was great. The first two days in Seattle I could have savedon a rental car because so many attractions were within walking distanceI got a dorm type of a room, and added to the 2 week advance bookingdiscount I saved bunches of money.  I always felt safe. I'm a 54 yr old woman and was with my college age daughter. I particularly liked the internet access in the lobby. The place appeared to be newly remodled and was very clean. I liked the open windows and the room was always cool at nite (in August!). I met several very interesting people and there were lots of youngsters from Europe touring the US. All very pleasant and polite. I you don't need fancy, but like a clean, centrally located and reasonablely priced place the Moore is your best bet.

<Content>Great price, location and Staff The Moore is an old Hotel, but is is clean, the beds are comfortable, my husband said that the pillows were the most comfortable he has ever slept with.You can stay at any chain hotel and after you check out you can't remember much about it. Not so at the Moore Hotel, first of all the Hotel staff are the friendliest we have ever met, Robert was outstanding. They will go out of their way to help you, in finding a bus, dining spot, events.....  When we called to make our reservations we asked about parking our rental car. They told us that we did not need a car in the city, city transportion is free. They saved us over $300, by us not having to pay the airport car rental charge, renting the car for a shorter period of time and no parking charge. We took bus #194 from the airport for $1.50 and walked 2 blocks to the Moore. When we were ready to leave the city we took the free bus to Budget rental and took off to the ferries. If you come into the city by the airport check out the coupon book. The Moore is in the book, which they honored upon check in. We had a room with private bath, which cost us less than $70. The cleaning staff have quite the knack for folding the towels into interesting shapes. While staying at the Moore check into eating at the Farestart Restaurant just a few doors away. It is a food service training facility for the Homeless, every Thursday they have a Guest Chef work with the students making a 3 couse meal, it was fantastic. When we come to Seattle again we will stay at the Moore.

<Content>Spartan but clean and close Entering the hotel was like entering a 2 star European hotel in a major city. Simple, spartan but friendly (minus the smoke). We were there 3 days and the hotel grew on us. It's age turned to charm and the clean and simple rooms a bed and little else were just what we wanted to pay for. We didn't miss the pool, restaurant, fitness center, in-room coffee or any other nice but unnecessary 'frill' provided and most other hotels. At just a couple of blocks from Pike's Market, the location is perfect. The parking shuffle can be an issue - moving from street to lot - but the timing really worked out OK for us. (need to move the car off the street by 8am). The neighborhood seemed safe enough - as did most of Seattle - although the panhandlers around town are a real annoyance. The mayor might do well to read up on Giuliani's program in NYC. Back to the hotel - For the price and location, it's a must for anyone on a budget or just interested in a nice old place in a great location. Just don't expect all those creature comforts....

<Content>Great location, clean rooms I've stayed here 3 times, and you just can't beat the price or the location - just a couple blocks from Pike Place Market. The first two times we got a room with a shared bathroom ($55 for two people/one bed). However, the last time we stayed, we'd forgotten to book ahead and all hotel rooms downtown were booked up. The Moore had one room left, which was a suite for $120. It was like staying in a large one bedroom apartment, and we thought the king(?) size bed/bedding was of better quality than the less expensive rooms. The furniture was nice, the kitchen and bath seemed newly renovated, and overall it was a terrific value for the space. The suite would probably be good for families, or people who need a hotel room with a kitchen.

<Content>Location, Location, Location It's a bit assuming to write an excellent review about a hotel as spartan as the Moore but this place is a real value for money find. The double room was large and clean and the bed comfortable while the staff was extremely helpful. But the relatively low cost isn't the main reason to choose this hotel. The main reason is that it's around the corner from Pikes Market, a block and a half away from the monorail and a 15 minute walk down to Pioneer Park. That's all we had the time to explore in the day we spent in Seattle.

<Content>Don't stay for the hotel - stay for the location Make no mistake - the Moore is pretty much a dump. Its old and any improvements/repairs all look completely half baked. However, everything was functional, the price was not bad ($91 plus tax for two queens and a roll away), and I thought the location was perfect for us - close to Pikes Place market (can buy anything), the Waterfront (Bainbridge Ferry/shops, seafood restaraunts), Belltown (pubs/clubs), and the Monorail for a trip to the Space Needle area. I thought Seattle was great - plenty of specialty shops, restaraunts, coffee shops, pubs, and clubs, plus the water. Loved it.

<Content>was ok I consider the Moore Hotel a good deal for downtown Seattle. The location is very close to the harbour and the piers. Although the neighbourhood is not the best, I never felt unsafe.The room was clean enough but the lamp did not have a lamp shade. The closet smelled of moth balls or disinfectant. Unfortunately, I had to change rooms after two days although I made my reservation a long time in advance.

<Author><3_luv_2_travel
<Content>Dont be fooled like me I stayed here last month and was terribly disappointed. After reading several great reviews about the Moore on tripadvisor, I decided that this might be the best place to stay in Seattle for a great price. I ended up spending $69 a night, which is a steal for downtown Seattle. However from the moment I pulled up I soon realized why it was so cheap.First of all, it is in the ghetto part of DT Seattle. There are only about 2 blocks which I would consider bad, and The Moore is situated right there in the middle of the bad part of town. Second of all, we were taken back by the strong smell of pine sol when we entered our room. After leaving for the evening and returning to our room, we discovered why the pine sol scent was so strong----it was masking the smell of urine in our room!!! I believe that the cleaning people tried to get rid of the urine smell by bombarding our room with cleaning supplies. I tried to air out the room,but the noise from the street down below made it unbearable to get a good night's sleep.Last but not least, no one said anything to me when I booked the room that there would not be any parking. I understand that most hotels downtown have paid parking, but the Moore had nothing. I had two options: 1) Leave my car on the street in the middle of the ghetto(which even the front desk was a bad idea) or 2) pay a parking garage $40 a day.My suggestion to anyone considering the Moore: If you want the low price, stay outside of DT since you will have to pay for parking anyways, or break the bank and stay at a nicer place!Oh yeah- our sheets were dirty too!

<Content>Hidden Gem After scouring the web for an inexpensive hotel in downtown Seattle, I came across the Moore Hotel on tripadvisor. I was surprised by all of the positive reviews it had, because I hadn't come across it on expedia, orbitz, etc. I was a little skeptical but stayed there for 3 nights in June. After my experience staying at the Moore, I felt that I definitely had to post a review. For anyone who's a little weary about how reliable on-line reviews are, the Moore Hotel will not disappoint. My room was huge, clean, and as a single female traveler, I felt completely safe. The location is unbeatable--just 2 short blocks from Pike Place Market. And I still can't believe how inexpensive it was. Awesome hotel. Would definitely stay there again if I ever go back to Seattle.

<Content>Great Little Secret in Seattle Went to Seattle for business in June and in an attempt to save the company some money I booked a room at the Moore. All the reviews I had read about the hotel were right-on. It is CLEAN, safe, old, and an incredible price. Every employee was exceptional and friendly. I was a little intimidated by the location at first, but after getting familar with the area, found it to be very convenient and safe. I will stay there again.

<Content>Charmed by the Moore The Moore must be the best kept secret in Seattle. I researched downtown hotels extensively online and booked a room here for a weekend trip. I got a nice little room with a claw foot bath tub for $70 a night. The staff was very nice and accomodating. I used the internet in the lobby to check my flight times. The bar seemed a little daunting to a solo female traveler but there were many other options close by. Got an early check in which was awesome. Can't wait to come back.

<Content>Don't be put off by the neighbors! After doing a little research looking for a 2 bedroom for 4 adults, I choose the Moore Hotel. I was given a rate of $135 a night (plus $10 for the extra 2) for a total of $150 a night. What we recived for our $150 a night was the biggest 3 bedroom you've ever seen! The 1st room had a full size bed, the 2nd room had 2 twin size beds, and the 3rd room had a queen. Each of the 3 rooms had a sink, and we did have to share a bathroom. Yes, we had no air conditioning, but we got 2 fans from the front desk, and left our windows (that open completly) cracked to get a nice cool breeze.I was worried at first when we arrived, as the lobby was very old and had not been updated in a long time, and there were a few characters hanging out right outside the entrance. However, the desk staff was very friendly and helpful, and assured us not to worry about the people outside. We took the (tiny) elevator to our room, where we were very impressed with the cleaning job and the size of the room. Being on the 4th floor, we wern't blessed with the greatest view in the world, but that was just fine. Yes the parking situation -----, but there are plenty of lots across the street, and if you park at night on the street, it is free, and very safe. Check out the Night Lite lounge next door for the best cheap strong drinks in the city. A funky little dive, where we were made to feel right at home.

<Content>great for the price stayed here 2 nights before visiting Vancouver and 1 night after and both rooms were basic (1st room had a victorian bathtub) but clean. Staff had made an effort with the folded towels although they were a little small.A very old crotchety lift that was going to need some attention but always got us to our floor. Free internet in the lobby and very freindly young staff on the desk. In a great location 2 blocks from Pike place market and a reasonable 'local' bar right nextdoor. Also connected to the Moore Theatre but we couldn't get tickets to Mary Chapin-Carpenter who was playing there on our last night. Think we paid about $75 per night which is a good price for the location. Rooms (we had en-suite) are a good size but no fridge or mini-bar (we used the sink to keep a bottle of wine cool). The Moore seemed to be undergoing a face lift while we were there like decorating the lobby and replacing furnishings etc. Would definitely stay again if the prices stayed this reasonable.

<Content>Incredible price, better location! After an exhaustive online search, I booked the Moore Hotel from May 22-24, 2005, for my sister and I to take a short shopping/sightseeing trip to Seattle. After a beautiful 3-hour drive from Vancouver, Canada, we arrived (late check-in; no problem) to be greeted by the cool front-desk clerk, who was more than accomodating. Our room, on the 6th floor with a lovely view of the Sound, was large and comfortable, with an impeccably clean bathroom complete with creatively-folded towels, just like in the Caribbean! For $69 a night, I couldn't imagine a better value in a major city, especially given the location, within walking distance of Pike Place Market, amazing shopping and great Belltown restaurants. Don't forget to ask the front-desk staff about parking. We were directed to a parkade across the street for $15/24 hours. Every city should have a Moore Hotel!

<Content>What a deal! I believe the Moore is the best budget hotel I've ever stayed in. I've stayed there four times over the past two or three years and every time I've been, my room has been clean and pleasant, the staff are friendly and helpful, the beds are comfortable and the location cannot be beat. I always stay in the rooms with a shared bath and I have always found the bathrooms to be in impeccable condition and I have never once had to wait for an occupied bathroom. The hotel is located in Belltown where there are great restaurants, music clubs and bars everywhere. It's a quick walk to the Public Market, downtown or the Seattle Art Museum. It's on several major bus lines that'll take you just about anywhere in the city.Just remember: the Moore is a budget hotel. You do get towels, sheets and soap, but that's it. The rooms are simple, almost bare, and it does feel like the building has seen better days. There's no overnight parking which is my only real complaint about the place especially since parking is so dang expensive. But for $60/night in downtown Seattle you can't expect luxury. What you do get, though, is a heck of a deal.

<Content>Excellent Historic Hotel at a Very LOW Price-Many Rooms with Shared Bath Historic Hotel just blocks from Pikes Market. The hotel offers very clean rooms, each with a sink, as well as a telephone, cable TV, Comfortable Queen size bed, several lamps, night stand, desk and several chairs. The room I had was very large and clean. The room's outside wall was all large windows with a great view of the Sound. I chose a room with a shared bath. I found the bathrooms down the hall were always kept clean, and I never had to wait to use one. The maids fold the towels and wash cloths into animal designs, such as a swan, which offers a nice welcoming touch to the room. Overall, I found the staff to be very friendly, and the location was tops. Only drawback if you are visiting in the middle of the summer is that they do not have air-conditioning. For the price you can't go wrong. They do not have parking, which you really don't need, as the downtown busses are free from 6:00am to 7:00pm (provided that you stay within the free bus zone). If you do need parking, there is a parking lot just across the street. Right next door to the Hotel is The Moore Theater. It is the oldest theater in Seattle, and is still in operation. The hotel's web site is: ------------

<Content>Great Place If you are looking for a hotel that is close to the action and will have some money left over for fun, this is the place. Service was great, from booking to checking in etc. Very friendly staff. The room, which was a suite on the 7th floor, was fantastic! Okay sure the towels were a bit wimpy, but the arrangements they were put in daily was terrific. The view was great, fun to watch the ferries and cargo ships go by. We ended up just leaving our car on the street overnight. It was intact every morning. A great bargain, don't make the mistake of staying somewhere else to save a few dollars. Granted it is not new, but it does have old charm and they have done a lot to spice it up. Thumbs up Moore hotel.

<Content>Great Place, I will go back for sure A friend and I went out to Seattle in October specifically to see Queensryche (a rock band from Seattle for those who don't know who they are). We were spending 5 nights there and wanted to stay close to the venue. Well the venue was the Moore Theatre, so we stayed at the Moore Hotel right next door. It was a great stay. The staff got on my nerves at first with check in, but that was quickly forgotten. Our room was very roomy and clean, if we left the room in the morning, it was cleaned, clean linen was put on the beds etc... before we returned in the afternoon. The hotel has a great view, I would recommend one of the upper floors, as most people recommend. We walked everywhere, the Monorail wasn't running while we were there, but that was ok, the walking was great because the weather was wonderful. I would recommend anyone staying there, it's a great hotel for a great price and close to everything you would need. Whenever I return to Seattle, which I am hoping is at least once a year if not more, I will stay at the Moore again.

<Content>Best kept secret in Seattle What a great find and what a great price! Thank you TripAdvisor! I stayed at the Moore for two nights before moving to the Grand Hyatt for a conference I had to attend. In my humble opinion, the Moore's location was infinitely better than the Hyatt's. Although it's 100 years old, the Moore glows - the restoration was done well and the rooms are quite comfortable. Downtown Seattle, in all its splendor, is just a couple of short blocks away. The restaurants and nightlife of Belltown are right there too. I loved having Starbucks on the next block for my morning coffee, and Pike Place is just a few blocks away for breakfast The young man who worked at the front desk each evening was also fascinating to talk to. I can't wait for my next visit. The Moore is a jewel!

<Content>Great for budget travelers, cute vintage charm Great views, high ceilings, vintage charm. Indie bar called the Nightlight? is attached to lobby. Close to everything. I stay here when attending tradeshows or rock shows. Price range is from $39 - $129 depending on whether you want dorm style shared bathroom/private room or all the way up to a multi-room suite. Very clean, would stay here again. Close to great restaurants, Belltown, shopping. Can't say enough good things about this place.

<Content>Cheap and friendly with no frills If you are on a tight budget and don't feel like spending much time in your room---this is the place. The rooms are very dated and sparce with thin towels and no ameneties(blow dryers-shampoo-irons) All of the linens, however, were very clean. When I plugged in my blowdryer in the morning---the lights dimmed from the power drain...the windows were very thin and you can hear the sirens going down 2nd and Virginia through the night..Luky for me---my visit to the Liquid lounge by the Space Neddle provided me with a little extra sleeping power.The location can not be beat---Walk to Pikes and the waterfront as well as the mall and the Monorail. The Rail stops at 7pm and the taxi ride back from the Space Needle was only $4.50 exc. tip.The front desk was very friendly----What the Moore lacks in sparkle--it makes up for in service.If old means charmingand peeling paint means vintage---you will like the Moore---The price and location can not be beat---just don't expect a mint on your pillow :)

<Content>I Love Staying at the Moore Hotel You will not find a better place to stay at comparable prices in Seattle. Staff are very helpful, rooms are very clean and the hotel itself is charming and interesting. Very close to Downtown Seattle, bus lines, the ferries and only a few short blocks north of Pike Place Market. If you are looking for plush towels and jacuzzi's, stay elsewhere. If you are looking for historical ambience, a staff that cares and to save yourself some money, the Moore cannot be beat. You can tell they are really trying to make this a well loved place to stay and at the rates charged, it's hard not to love this old beauty of a hotel.

<Content>Cheap and Clean I was in a group of six girls that traveled to Seattle. We needed somewhere that was cheap and clean, and that is exactly what we found at the Moore. The location couldnt be better...we were able to walk everywhere just about everywhere. We were all able to stay together in a suite Caution: there is only one bathroom in the suite. But for us it was like a big slumber party. The staff couldnt be better. They were very knowledgable and were able to send us to different places every night for dinner. Since there was a large group and only one key (yes key, not key card) we had to leave it at the desk. The staff never once complained about us constantly bothering them to get the key, and by the time we left they knew most of our names. If you are looking for a nice upscale hotel, try the andra, but if you just want a cean room and a friendly staff then this is the place for you!!!

<Content>Great location and fair price Had two seperate stays at The Moore. First room was on the 6th floor and had a nice view of the Puget Sound. The room had updated furniture, bathroom fixtures and possibly new carpet. I was pleasantly surprised. I was prepared for the small and thin towels. The water pressure wasn't good and I am not that finicky. Second room had bad water pressure as well. There was music at the Theatre one night, but at least it was soothing to fall asleep too. Can't say enough about the helpful and knowledgable staff. Kudos! GREAT LOCATION!!

<Content>2-star Tourist Class Hotel This is a very historic place. The rooms are clean and the location is convenient, but hotel ammenities such as shampoo, notepaper, coffee-maker are missing. The radiator clangs throughout the night (when it's cold outside) and there's not even a clock to tell what time it is.If you're on a budget, I would recommend the Moore Hotel, just don't expect any luxuries.

<Content>Excellent Hotel! I have stayed at the Moore Hotel the last 3 times I have been to Seattle.The location is perfect! Walking distance to Pike Place, Downtown and even the Space Needle.Resturants are all over and the Crocodile cafe is a block away.My only concern would be if it was hot in Seattle. There is no A/C.

<Content>Decent Economy Hotel-Excellent Location I stayed at the Moore Hotel on Dec 3rd, 4th and 5th, 2004 and I have to say the Moore Hotel had it's positives and some negatives. If you are a tourist and want to check out some of Seattle's downtown famous attractions like The Space Needle, Pike's Place Market and Pioneer Square then the Moore is a great hotel to stay in because you can walk to all three of these locations from the hotel.The Moore Hotel has clean rooms, they are kind of old, but it's a clean place to sleep and shower. The staff are very friendly, but the only bad side is, you won't get the nice bathroom amneties in a Holiday Inn or a Hilton. The Moore Hotel's bathrooms are small (they are clean) but small, the towels are very thin and not full bath size, so bring your own. Other than that, it's a nice place to sleep and stay for a short period of time.We had a room facing Elliot's Bay, and it was a beautiful view. There is a large mall about 3 blocks from the hotel. Pike's Place market is 2 blocks from the Moore Hotel, the space needle is about 8 blocks away, and you can catch the free city bus to Pioneer Square if you don't feel like walking 10 blocks. Basically, the Moore Hotel is a clean place to sleep at night, it's clean and the rates are very reasonable for a hotel in downtown Seattle. I'd stay there again, for a short time. If you are arriving in Seattle from Sea-Tac International Airport, use the transportation company 'Shuttle Express', they have vans that take you from the airport to the hotel for about $20 bucks...they are efficient, on-time, friendly, and affordable...they dropped us off and picked us up from the Moore Hotel perfectly.

<Content>Faithfully Yours I've stayed here several times over the last few years when visiting Seattle for various events. I love this hotel - what it lacks in ammenities, it makes up for with it's always friendly staff and awesome location. Want to see a show? Go to the Moore Theater next door. Want to shop? The two best shopping centers in Seattle are within walking distance, as is the monorail station to the Space Needle. Pike Place Market is litterally two blocks away. And if you're on a really tight budget, stay on the top floor and share you bathroom - you might have to go down the hall to use the shower, but you'll have a heck of a view for about $40 a night. Fantastic!

<Content>great value The Moore was a great base for a first trip to Seattle. The rooms are large and bright, and although some of the bathroom fittings were a bit elderly, everything is very clean. My only warning - make sure you're not near the adjoining theatre if a heavy metal band are playing - on the last day of our stay, a band was rehearsing and it was so loud it made our teeth rattle!

<Content>Great location, great price, great hotel I really don't see how you would ever find a better hotel in Seattle at that price. My husband and I go to Seattle about once or twice a year and never think of staying anywhere else. The hotel is starting to show its age, but our room is always clean, the staff is always courteous, and it's got the most convenient location a tourist could ask for. (Easy walk to lots of great restaurants, shopping, Pike Place, etc.) Highly recommend it. Plus, at that great price, you have extra money for some of the great restaurants and bars in the neighborhood. (Marco's Supper Club is our favorite.)

<Content>I am faithful to the Moore! I am an East Coaster and an avid world traveler who visits Seattle once a year to see family. Every trip, I make a point to stay downtown a few nights and enjoy the city. This is my preference for lodging...I am faithful to the Moore Hotel! The price and location are phenomenal and I've come to love the quaint, personal style and service, not to mention the view from the upper floors! It is wonderful. I highly suggest it!

<Content>Great Location If you don't mind budget hotels and pretty thin towels, you will LOVE The Moore Hotel. It is very clean, the staff is very friendly and helpful, and it is within an easy walk to the market, and all other downtown locations. Parking is kind of a problem, but I think we could have done better if we had been smart enough to ask. We ended up feeding a meter several times a day and the cost to us for a 24-hour period was around $20-$24. As we were leaving I overheard the people at the front desk sending some guests to a parking lot that only charges $12 for 24 hours. We will definitely book our next stay at The Moore Hotel. You just can't beat the price and the beds are great!

<Content>Loved it We really loved it. We had one of the rooms on the upper floor (bathroom down the hall) and had a great view of the Bay. The room had a great European antique-y feel. The location was perfect - we even walked back from the baseball game. And it was a great value. Can't wait to go back.

<Content>Fantastic Value After reading reviews on the Moore, my wife an I chose to stay here based on price and location. We were not disappointed. Two blocks from Pike Place for less than $70 before taxes is tough to beat. A clean room with a partial view of the sound adds to the value. Our only knock would be that there was no A/C, which could be a problem on a very hot day as the room gets full afternoon sun.

<Content>Moore hotel good value for Canadians! Visited Seattle first time in August- to bicycle with cascade bike club up to Vancouver ( 180km).The Moore hotel was clean and allowed my bicycle into the room- it was only 2 blocks from the Pike market which had all kinds of healthly foods. It is older but well kept, the fan they lend you helped with the road noise and heat. It is well priced for canadians who are spending candadian dollars. The young fellow at front desk was a pleasure to talk with.I will be doing this ride each summer and staying at this motel.It was an adventure cycling from the airport to downtown- midday is the ony time to attemtp this.thanks again Moore hotel!!Paul

<Content>Much better than we expected We stayed in August 2004 and after reading some of these reviews we approached the hotel with some trepedation. What we found was great. We had room 605 which turned out to be a comfortable sitting room (with kitchenette), a large bedroom and bathroom. It was quiet, light, airy and spacious. The location was perfect for walking to all the attractions and the many restaurants close by. After traveling thru the States for a month, this was the best value for money accomodation we had anywhere.

<Content>What a deal! I picked the Moore on the basis of reviews here, and we weren't disappointed! It is in a great Seattle location, close to everything. The rates were reasonable, we had a larger room at the back and it was immaculately clean, spacious and comfortable. It doesn't have the little things like shampoo, hair dryers etc. but since I knew that, we brought our own. The staff was helpful, provided internet access in lobby to check email. Even with the heat wave, with the windows open and a fan provided by management, we were fine. I would stay here again anytime!

<Content>Great price, no air-conditioning This is a great hotel for the price. Clean rooms and a comfortable bed, no frills. They even allowed us to check in early.Consider the time of year you will be visiting Seattle. We stayed during one of the hottest days in August and discovered our room had no air-conditioning. Normally this would not be a problem, simply open a window. However, our room overlooked Second Street and we were blessed with an array of street traffic noise, including cars with loud bass systems as well as ambulances.Great hotel during cool months, not good during a heat wave.

<Content>The Moore Hotel is a treasure My 10-year-old daughter and I stayed at the Moore Hotel on Aug. 10  11. I'd done Internet research on at least six other budget hotels in Seattle before choosing the Moore, and booking a room there turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made in a long, long time. Our sixth-floor room was newly remodeled and exceptionally clean and spacious and we had a great view of part of the waterfront, as well as the Olympic Range off in the distance. The rates are extremely reasonable, the access to the Pike Street Market and other downtown destinations is unbeatable, the neighborhood is very well-lit and safe, and the staff members were all extremely friendly and helpful. I would stay there again in a minute........

<Content>Great little place and fantastic staff What makes this place excellent is the exceptional staff. Bob and Ed! WE LOVE YOU! Moore Hotel is situated between Stewart and Virginia on 2nd Ave. Just one block from Pike's Place. All other major attractions are within easy reach by foot or via the free downtown metro bus. If you don't have pre-arranged transport, take bus 194 from the airport to Westlake center (2 blocks from Moore Hotel). It's only a 30 minute ride for $1.25. The hotel currently is under renovation but is still open as they fix a few rooms at a time. We were lucky to get the newer ensuite rooms on the 5th floor when we were there on 2 separate occasions - 520 and 500. The renovated rooms look kind of eclectic but are very clean and spacious. Rooms have no air con which can make it quite warm in the summer but you can borrow a small fan from the front desk. Parking is across the hotel for about $10 overnight and is gated at night - I did not have a car but overheard the lady at the front desk. There's more parking on the back of the hotel on 3rd Ave for about the same price. If you don't know your way around, just ask the front desk and they'll tell you or give up tonnes of suggestions on places to go. There's no room service or restaurants in the hotel but there's no lack of restaurants surrounding the hotel. Do take note that restaurants/shops along 1st Ave/Pike Place close around 6 pm on weekdays (not sure about weekends). Shops/restaurants around Westlake Center close much later around 8.30 pm.I would definately recommend this hotel if you're looking for clean and friendly place to stay without the high downtown prices.

<Content>A Great Place at a Great Price! In my opinion, the Moore Hotel couldn't have been a nicer hotel. I'm so glad that we stayed there. It's two blocks away from the market and close to some great places to eat. Not only is it close to everything, but the price was great. The rooms are very large and CLEAN (with no strange bathroom smells). We even had a nice view and didn't get charged an extra $25-45 dollars for it like the other hotels wanted. If you're not fussy and don't need room service, this is a great place to stay. Also, when I made my reservation a month in advance, the man I dealt with was a real sweetheart. He was very friendly and helpful and never got annoyed with my 20 questions and the 5 times I called back to make sure everything was okay. The Moore Hotel definitely made our stay in Seattle very comfortable and enjoyable. It will be the first place I come back to the next time I'm in Seattle!

<Content>Loved the hotel Our stay at the Moore was a great experience. This is a budget hotel, so no big fluffy towels, but the room was large and very quiet. The bed was comfortable and firm, much appreciated by my back. The staff was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed exploring downtown on foot and the view of the inner harbor from the room on the 7th floor.

<Content>Great for budget-minded travelers If you are looking for a fancy, 4-5 star hotel --- The Moore is not the place for you. However, if you are looking for a clean, comfortable room and bath, The Moore is the place to go.The front of the hotel looks a little seedy and you will not recognize it from the pictures on the net. Do NOT be put off or run away!!!!The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was huge...barren of decoration, but the bed was comfy. The room and bathroom were clean, so was the hallway.It is very convenient to most of the attractions. A couple of blocks to Pike Market and the waterfront. Easy walking to other attractions. You can get to Pioneer Square without walking up any hills!!!!This is a no-frills place - no bellmen, no concierge, no real ambience...but it does have an elevator and friendly employees.We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>great character and style We have stayed at the Moore several times over the past 8 years. We were always afraid it would go the way of many downtown hotels in North America - new furniture and higher prices.We have never been disappointed. It has always exceeded our expectations.

<Content>great comfort, great bargain, great location - just GREAT!!!! stayed at the moore in august 2003 and it was awesome!!!walked everywhere and the front desk even had a wonderful vase for the huge boquet of flowers from pike's place market...they lasted the whole five days i was there...the night light lounge next door is wonderfully divey and a great place for afternoon cocktails before walking over to pioneer square...farestart is located just down the block from the moore and offers wonderful food including a great lunch buffet for a reasonable price and also supports locals who are learning the restaurant biz...thursdays offer a guest chef for dinner, but make a reservation as they book up quickly....i stayed on the seventh floor and had a great view of puget sound...large windows let in the great seattle air and kept the room comfy without AC even in august...service was great...room and bath were cleaned and restocked every day...the moore is a great place to stay if you want to be in the heart of things and not spend a mint...i can't wait to get back...
