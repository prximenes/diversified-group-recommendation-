<Content>Good hotel, great location Hotel was in a fantastic location in the south of Boston within easy walking distance of both Copley Square and downtown Boston.The room was a reasonable size and clean. They were also fantastic at offering a late check out - 2pm on a Friday afternoon - much appreciated.Only negative comment is that the windows do not give much sound insultation and as the hotel is above a bar and on a busy bus route you should come prepared with ear plugs.By the way, you can get a great breakfast at the coffee shop around the corner.Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>basic clean accommodation This is basic accommodation. Room is small, good location, clean (although sheets not changed in an 8 night stay). Friendly if slightly defensive staff. Note that this hotel is near the Mass, turnpike so you have traffic noise all night. There would not appear to be any quiet rooms (according to front desk). Great gay sports bar downstairs and dont miss Billy's Cafe round the corner for great lunch or breakfast. Nice staff and really cheap.

<Content>Perfect for us! After reading some of the reviews we were worried about going to the hotel. We took a cab from logan to the hotel which took around 15mins. When we arrived we noticed the hotel was next to a bar, but we never heard any noise from the bar throughout the out week. Our room was nice, (nothing amazing) it was clean, comfy and had all what we needed. It had a TV which had loads of channels (although we hardley watched tv). The bathroom was small but really clean and everything worked. We had it cleaned daily with fresh towles. There was no tea and coffee in the room but there was a machine downstairs and you could have a bucket of ice in your room. The hotel was in a brill place, 5 min walk from back bay subway and if you get a good map you can walk to many attraction and malls. Lots of restaurants and starbucks and dunkin dougnuts around. The hotel were really informitive and called us taxi's often, they let us keep our luggage in the hotel after check out too as our floght was in the evening. Overall wewere really pleased and it was cheap too.

<Content>Great location! This inn is in a neighborhood that is indicative of Boston's architecture with brick townhouses. The local coffee shop was great and we were within walking distance of the Prudential shops and restaurants and several underground stations. The room was small but nice and clean.

<Content>Mixed Bag This hotel while quirky and cool, with friendly and knowledgeable staff, and having a great location to explore downtown Boston neighborhoods (Back Bay, South End, Beacon Hill, Downtown, etc.), also has small rooms and bathrooms, is a little more expensive than we'd hoped for (certainly given the size of the room), and has a horrible air-conditioning system. Our air conditioner (located in room 508) was a tiny window unit that blew light cool air inconsistently, would freeze up if left on high, and would also leak water after time no matter the setting. We stayed there 3 nights while on our honeymoon, and getting up in the middle of the night to adjust the air conditioner is decidedly un-romantic. Still, if you're looking for great location for the price (most hotels in Boston exceed $200/night, and this one was about $160), and like the hominess of its staff, this is good hotel. I'd give it a grade of a C+/B-. (Note to the staff: UPGRADE YOUR FRIGGIN' AIR-CONDITIONING UNITS PLEASE!).

<Content>Chandler Inn is a dungeon!! My fiancee and I were horrified by the conditions of the Chandler Inn. Trust me when I say that the photos online are VERY deceiving. Our room was extremely small, dark, dirty, and scary. In addition, there was an odd, musty odor that made my stomach turn when we walked in. I didn't think it could get worse, but the teeny tiny bathroom was disgusting and the toilet paper roll left on the dispenser was an old roll with like 2 squares left on it!!! We wanted to check out immediately but there were no other hotels available for the weekend so we suffered through the first two nights. We asked for an upgrade if available and the staff was less than friendly and not helpful. On top of all this, the cleaning staff threw away some of our clothes in a bag we left in the room and we barely received an apology for it. The ONLY thing that was positive about this place is that when we thankfully had an opportunity to switch hotels, they did not charge us for the nights we didn't stay.

<Content>The Chandler was not what it advertised to be... I decided to stay at the Chandler because of their great website and claims of being a boutique hotel, unfortunately this was not the case. While there is a great little bar attached to the hotel the hotel itself was basically a 1 star at best. I have honestly stayed at nicer hostels with a bit better upkeep. My room smelled of old cigarettes and overall needed to be aired out for a few days. The bed had a rubber sheet over the mattress that squeaked every time you turned over and the bathroom was quite tiny, to the point of being uncomfortable. The positives were a pleasant staff, great water pressure and a lovely neighborhood with great restaurants within walking distance.

<Content>Total misrepresentation on website My husband and I searched for a hotel on Expedia for a 2 night stay in Boston and the Chandler Inn is located exactly where we wanted to be. Before booking on Expedia ($140 a night) I checked out the hotel's website and it looked like a completely different hotel. I assumed they went thru a renovation and that the photos on Expedia were old, so I went through with the reservation and requested a King bed. When we arrived, they had me sign in and on my reservation it was written in large letters EXPEDIA. The elevator up to our room was done in all grey and opened up into a dingy stairwell from which you then enter a long hall to your hotel room. When we got into our room, Room 404, I was shocked by the size and look. It looked nothing like the rooms on the hotel's website. It was a creepy little room with stained carpet, very cheap furnishings, no luggage rack, no closet (just a tiny faux blonde wood laminated armoire), a polyester bedspread on a FULL-SIZE BED and a view of the office building directly across the street - out of one small window that was bolted shut and had an air conditioning unit that took up half the window. There was one outlet in the entire room and everything was plugged into it, so to charge a phone, we had to choose something to unplug. The light fixture in the ceiling gave off a depressing fluorescent hum and the bathroom was so tiny we couldn't put any of our toiletries in it, we had to keep them all on the only surface in the room - the small desk. The bathroom door had been painted so many times, that it didn't shut properly. We went downstairs and asked about another room as I had requested a King size bed, but was told they only had twins and queen-sized beds (ours was not a queen - but a Full...there is a significant difference). I suspected that they had Expedia rooms and that since we got a good price we were given this small, dingy room, but after reading other reviews, I guess they're all the same. I haven't stayed in such a depressing room since backpacking through Europe on a punishing budget. The only positive things were the location and the cleanliness of the room. One last note: it would be really nice if the older guys at the front desk were a little warmer; really, I mean, curt one-word answers don't cut it in customer service anymore. Just because people don't want to pay the truly outrageous hotel prices that seem to have become standard in the past few years, doesn't mean we deserve substandard customer service. Bottom line: I think we can all do much better than this hotel. At the very least, they should provide truthful representation on their website of the rooms they offer.

<Content>Good hotel for tourists The hotel is located in South Boston, in a quiet area with many shops and restaurants. The historical area of Boston is not far (you can walk there in about 20min).It can be a good choice for baseball fans as well: Fenway park (home of the Red Sox) is in walking distance.Rooms are nicely furnished, with small bathrooms. They don't serve breakfast in the hotel, but it's not a big deal since there're a couple of good breakfast places in the nearby.Good hotel, I'd suggest it.

<Content>The Chandler Inn: Great Location, Great Deal The Chandler Inn is a nice hotel. It has a stylish lobby, with very nice staff who take care of you immediately. In addition, the staff are very helpful and knowledgable about the neighborhood and giving directions. In the lobby there is a great coffee/tea/hot chocolate machine. Next to this machine there are stairs but don't fear there are also two elevators. The room I stayed in, the standard twin, was a no frills room. It had everything it was supposed to have (which is listed on the website). The bathroom wasn't exquisite, but it was simple, like the room. My room had a window overlooking the street (beautiful!!). Furthermore, it is difficult to find such a bargain in such an upscale city.The simplicity and plainess of the Chandler Inn surprised me, and I enjoyed it. However, this may also repulse you. So it's not that the Chandler Inn is bad it is clean, safe, comfy. It's just a matter of perspective and preference.*Note: When you leave the hotel, you have to return the key to the receptionist. It sounds silly, but if you ask why they will willingly tell you (it is a very sound reason).

<Content>The Chandler...a NIce little GEM! We've already stayed at one of Boston's pricier hotels. After searching through the internet, my husband found what seemed to be a nice place to accomodate our 3 night stay. Overall, the staff was attentive, our room SMALL(but clean and attended to daily...everything worked, by the way!), the neighborhood quaint and picturesque(great walking/running and so close to downtown...unbelievable!) There are nice restaurants and conveniences (though not FRILLY enough to pamper those with 'champagne and caviar' tastes) that dot the area. We're a FIT couple anyway so the hotel's proximity to what Boston has to offer was appreciated. We also appreciate a great value, good service and cleanliness. We're as fussy as anyone else, but we gave the Chandler Inn a chance and our experience there will hopefully be repeated next year. Yeah, it was good enough for us!

<Content>Not a lot not to like This is my 3rd stay at the Chandler Inn. This time for 5 nights taking in a conference and some other business. I find it hard to understand the negative reviews this hotel gets. Sure, its a budget hotel - but you know that when you book it. With the Marriotts of the world @ circa $300 per night you are not going to get the Ritz for $150 per night in Boston. Regardless of what people have paid that is the 'going' rate. Don't use the hotels own site use one of the others - the rates are better.Yes the rooms are small and the bathroom smaller. I understand the guy who said the rooms remind him of his college dorm - but they are entirely adequate. The location is great (5 minutes to Backbay station or 10 minutes to Boyleston) with cafes around the corner, a CVS across the road and pizza and other food within a few minutes walk. The neighbour pleasant and non threatening and the hotel is clean. I've always found the staff pleasant and helpful.There appear to be some refurbished rooms (last time I stayed on the 8th floor in one) but I prefer the non-refurb room I stayed in the 1st time and this time as it has a desk. The free wifi works well but not, I guess, in all rooms as I've seen a few people sitting in the corridor with their laptops. Lets face it you are not going to stay here if you are on a corporate expense account. But as a budget choice in Boston I don't see much not to like. I'm back in Boston for another conference in June and have already booked my room.

<Content>Poor The prices here are out of date - I paid USD259 per night in April 2008. The rooms were small, no bath, no fridge and no aircon. There was also a large patch of water on the floor which the management were uninterested in fixing.Service standards from the staff were mixed -some were helpful, some not interested. Rooms were only cleaned in late afternoon, and then only after asking reception to send up a cleaner.The bar downstairs looks nice, but it is a gay bar so not suitable for families or couples. As it is non-smoking the customers tend to hang around outside the bar/hotel.

<Content>Ummm... It was bad! The staff was very hospitable and very friendly. The room was extremely small and the beds were very uncomfortable. The bathroom was about 5 by 3 including the bathtub. The shower head was, let's see, there was no shower head, it was just a stick coming out of the wall and the water kind of sprayed out of the little hole. It looked like a metal hose.The mold on the ceiling of the shower was the deal breaker for me since I am severely allergic to it.You can't rent movies and you have to turn in your key everytime you leave the hotel.So, don't let the price fool you, just beware!

<Content>Great place for a cost effective stay in Boston The hotel room was very clean and a good size for the price ($150 per night). The room had a decent enough selection of TV channels and the free WIFI was great. The staff were really helpful and made us feel at home. This hotel does not have a restaurant but you can order in from a number of local restaurants for which the hotel provides a guide. The location was great as only a 5 min walk from Back Bay Metro station and a 10min walk from Copley Square, the nicest parts of Boston centre. The cab ride from Logan airport cost us $20. Best deals for the hotel are on online.

<Content>online photos from their website are totally bogus! Don't stay here.... Nothing annoys me more in hotel websites than doctored photos...I'm just angry with myself that I didn't catch it myself...We stayed in a deluxe room based on their online photos...if this was deluxe, I'd hate to see standard... The room was a glorified closet, that looks like a bad wanna-be Starck designer threw up orange all over the place, including the bathroom amenities, that smelled like Tang...In the photos, the room has a spacious desk and chair...the actual room has a table that is used by the DVD player, and a chair in the corner...If you look carefully at the photo, you can see that it has been stretched to give the appearance that the room is considerably larger than it actually is....The bathroom photo shows a huge walk in shower and bathroom...I've had larger bathrooms on cruise ships, though it was nice to be able to shower, shave and (well, you get the idea) all at the same time....And the free breakfast? It was a $5 voucher at a local diner....the diner actually served great breakfast food...but it wasn't free....All in all, the Chandler Inn is adequate for a Boston stay...but totally dishonest about what it actually is providing travelers...that's reason enough for me not to stay there again.

<Content>Grat price - Great location I found this hotel while searching online and decided to give it a try based on the price and positive reviews.To start, the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel was cute!, the room was simple and clean...... small, but had a very comfortable queen bed and the bathroom/shower was fine. Why spend another $100 a night to stay anywhere else???? I recommend this hotel and will return---- J.R -- Troy N.Y

<Author>induway
<Content>reminds me of my college dorm room The hotel is located in the south part of Boston, somewhat close to the Prudential Center and other central Boston things. However, it is a rather character-less hotel, inside and out. My first reaction when I walked into the room was that it reminded me of my college dorm room - plain beige wallpapered walls, beige finishes, beige bedding - no character of any sort (aside from the one red plastic desk chair).The room was clean, the bathroom, albeit very small, was also clean. However, for $149 a night, I expected MUCH more.The problem really was in other areas:1) NOISY - at 7am, there were construction noises coming from above (5th floor) that continued until 9am! what's up with that?2) no heater... The thermostat was set at 65 degrees - which isn't that bad if you have nice blankets... However, the blankets were those really thin, cheap fuzzy poly things, that provided little warmth on a snowy winter day in Boston.3) no one at the front desk - I called the front desk twice after 11pm, and no one answered.4) we asked for a queen bed. However, the bed was a full and not a queen.Another annoyance, though minor, is the TV control. A lot of the Direct TV channels were unavailable, and so you had to surf through each individual channel to find what was available. There were literally hundreds of empty channels - and the printed channel guide was incomplete (for example, Comedy Central was on 230-something but was not listed on the printed channel guide).

<Content>Loved the Chandler Inn-- Definately Recommend It Stayed at the Chandler Inn for five nights in October '07 and it was just perfect. Friendly staff on arrival and a very clean, comfortable room awaited us. Housekeeping tended to the room everyday and the bathroom was extremely clean Yes, it is not 5 star but it is in a fabulous location and has a 7 / 11 store just round the corner, if you are stuck!

<Content>Basic and small, but clean, comfortable, non-franchise charm I stayed two nights at the Chandler last month. I wanted a clean, safe place to stay within walking distance of many local attractions, restaurants, etc., and I was more interested in seeing the city and spending my money on things other than a pricey hotel. The Chandler met my needs and expectations, and I would stay there again. As a single woman travelling alone, I felt very safe, both n the room and walking in the surrounding area. Contrary to some reviews I've read, it was VERY quiet. Staff were pleasant and helpful. The room was small, even tiny, and quite utilitarian, but that was okay with me. I would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Dormlike Room. Oct 5th 2007. Well my wife and I booked this because they let us stay 1 night and that 's all we needed. But according to our timing with booking, it was the last room in Boston at 250.00. It is not worth 250.00 because there is no ammenities, but, it is very centrally located in Boston. It is definitely clean. But the decor has a little to desire. We have stayed in MANY places for less with more ammenities. Barely 10 tv channels. Full size bed. SMALL Room. Most powerful shower we've ever experienced. It was like getting powerwashed. Anyway it is centrally located , basically in the heart of Boston. Right next door there is a busy gay bar. But that's not our scene so we avoided it. We would never stay there again.

<Content>It was perfect for us!!! The Chandler was a great getaway from Providence. Manager Kevin and staff were alot of fun. True as you read in most post , the TV reception could be better but who the hell comes to Boston to watch TV. The rooms are fine, and you can't beat the price, and think about all you get. ....Awesome Gay sports bar that's open air (sometimes) but always packed. Your two blocks from the T and in one of the most beautiful areas of Boston. Very safe area. The cafes are wonderful. Just a short walk in Eagle that later in the PM it becomes lot's of fun. Cruisy. I will always stay at The Chandler. .Best Staff, Best Location,Best Bars,Best Price. Best Cafes ect

<Content>Clean, affordable, friendly staff I was attending a conference in Boston during a week that unfortunately coincided with the Harvard commencement, so rates at all the big chain hotels were through the roof! The accommodations were modest; my very small room contained two somewhat uncomfortable single beds, a loud window air conditioner, a high-pressure borderline painful shower head, a TV with a very limited channel selection, and generally out-of-date decor. The room was very clean, however, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. There was free (albeit slow) wi-fi. The inn has a relationship with a very nice local gym that will sell you a day pass for $10. Within a short walk were several nice places to eat, Boston Common, and the T. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for someone traveling on a budget and looking for adequate, practical lodging.

<Content>Great stay My daughter and I just recently stayed at the Chandler Inn. It is conveniently located in the heart of the Sound End of town and basically within walking distance of all major sites and attractions. Our room was very clean and our stay made much more enjoyable by Geraldo, Kevin, Gretchen and especially Nathan who was most accomodating.There was ALWAYS someone around when we had a question or needed a taxi. We will definatley return to this lovely inn.SadieNewport, RI

<Content>Good deal, great location My boyfriend and I had found a recommendation for the Chandler Inn in a book on Boston. We booked online and were largely pleased with the stay.If you're looking for something upscale and luxurious, the Chandler Inn is not your place. However, it's in a very nice, picturesque, and quite central location in the city. You may need to do around 10-15 minutes of (brisk) walking to get to Boston Common and other sites of interest, but at least you're already starting out in a good part of the city.The room itself was average. We were a little unsure of what to make of the burn marks in the comforter, but the sheets and carpet were clean, as well as the bathroom. Also, we had (over the air-conditioner) a rather nice view of the street below.Essentially, the hotel looks slightly run-down, but for how clean it is, outdated decor isn't a problem. Considering what a clean and centrally-located lodging it is, the price is a great deal! We had no problems with the staff either. All in all, I wouldn't mind staying at the Chandler Inn again, but when I visit the city of Boston next time, I may try to book a little farther in advance so I can get a reasonably-priced room at a step-up. If you find yourself in the same situation we were in when booking (doing it last-minute) and find your options limited, don't be afraid to go with the Chandler Inn.

<Content>Clean, comfortable, convenient hotel I saw nothing at all seedy about his hotel. It is an old building but clean and well maintained. It is in a convenient, historic neighborhood of million dollar apartments right next to downtown. There is a wonderful cafe right around the corner. The room was freshly done over, and the bed was comfortable. The private bathroom was only big enough for one or perhaps two people, but that was fine. It's not a luxury hotel, but it's a good deal.

<Content>Lovely Inn for the Price My boyfriend and I went to Boston to see some friends and stayed over 1 night at the Chandler Inn. I started reading the reviews on TripAdvisor after I already booked the room, so, based on some of the reviews, I was really nervous as to what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised! The lobby is clean and modern. The desk staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. The room was small but lacked no essentials. Yes, the bathroom was tiny, but it was clean, and who needs a huge bathroom anyways? We had a late night out, and our request for a later check-out time was granted with no problem whatsoever. All in all, a great value for the price! Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Average, ok location The room was average, with a decently sized bed and a clean washroom. It is comparable to, e.g., a Travel Lodge or a Holiday Inn; there was nothing terribly special OR objectionable about the hotel because it had functional decor and decent service.

<Content>Okay / more or less The Hotel is really good situated. You reach Boston downtown within 10 min. on foot. And public transportation is just around the corner.Staff was very friendly.The room had a good size but it had an offensive smell....There is also a bar wich belongs to the Hotel, maybe interesting to mention that it is a gay-bar. But let me say, I've never seen some curious people in the hotel.Our room included Breakfast.I was a little bit surprised to get just ONE cupon for two persons about 5$ (not including the tax) so it was just impossible to get breakfast for two persons for this amount. Cupon was meant for a Restaurant just around the corner.... That's an absolute scream.Alltogether: It was okay for this stay. Next time I would search for another location to stay inn.

<Content>A Mixed Bag and A Comedy of Internet Errors I was placed in this hotel by a travel agent. I had a nice room at first. Lots of windows and It had a great view of Boston. But. No internet access. They said the wireless should work, but I had to sit in the hall to get it to work. Then, I had to move to another room where the internet access also didn't work. I thought it was my computer-- but then I learned that every floor has a different hook up. Finally, I had to take a dark, smoking room-- which smelled like someone was still smoking inside-- just to get the internet. After the first room that was fairly distressing. Although, I will say that the staff more than bent over backwards to try and help me out. They were actually apologetic... and sincere. There are no irons or coffee pots in the rooms and they like you to leave your key when you leave to go out which is odd. But you do get a paper every morning and the location is good-- easily accessible to Newbury St., the Prudential Center and other places. There's a good coffee/ sandwich place around the corner, a 7-11 and a great drycleaner. That being said, the parking is horrendous. And having to park at a lot for about $17 a day is a huge pain. There are alot of parking restrictions in the area-- so reading the signs is a must unless you want to get hit with a pricey ticket.

<Content>As bad as it gets (and worse!) This hotel is as seedy as they come. There is a reason why this place is always has available rooms when every other Boston hotel is booked.I travel to Boston for business each week and stay at a variety of moderately priced hotels like the Charlesmark on Boylston or the Newbury Street Inn on Newbury Street (both with comparable rates to the Chandler and feel like the Ritz in comparison.)I tried out the Chandler Inn last week because everything else was booked. I will never ever return nor would I ever recommend it to anyone, even a college student backpacking through North America. I would rather stay on someone's blow up air mattress.The mattresses are like no mattresses I have ever slept on before, even in third world countries (of which I have been to many.) They are like hollow cardboard boxes and they are covered in thick vinyl or plastic covers with thin, scratchy sheets that slide around on top of the plastic. This doesn't feel like a place where people actually come to sleep. The ancient AC units in the window have dust bunnies flying out of the filthy filters and sound as loud as a buzz saw and send out little cool air. Needless to say, I did not sleep. I woke up numerous times numb on one side or the other.This place is just horrendous. After my experience, I am wondering if the positive reviewers work at the hotel or are friends of the owner.

<Content>Great Place To Stay in Boston Being a former Bostonian and having worked in some of the area hotels, I can surely tell you that Chandler Inn is one of the best values in town. Yes, it is not fancy, but it is spotless, nicely located, and within walking distance to almost every attraction in town. Not only that, but the subway and Amtrak stations are just footsteps away. Yes, there is no parking at the hotel, but only a block away is a huge public parking garage that is fairly inexpensive. There is a gay bar on the first floor and it is very friendly and all are welcome...almost like a gay version of Cheers. The area restaurants can't be beat....Chandler Inn is in one of the trendiest neighborhoods in town. Lots to choose from. So anyway, if you like high-priced chain hotels with all the amenities, this place is not for you. But if you like a nice, inexpensive hotel in a great area of the city, then don't hesitate to come here. This hotel is great for the sightseer and person on a budget. I always stay here every time I'm visiting Boston. I mean, I could stay at a fancy hotel, but why? I'd rather spend my money having fun in the city than sitting around in some overpriced, generic hotel room all day. Wouldn't you?

<Content>Avoid except as a last resort The room was clean and the staff fine, but other than that was terrible all around. Had the feel of a hostel more than a real hotel room.The bed - I could feel the springs digging into my back all night. Light - Dim and kept buzzing on and off.Carpeting - CheapThere is a bar downstairs and after last call at 2am the people spill out and start talking loudly. You can hear them clearly because the windows do not shut completely to accomodate the room air conditionerThere is wireless but it runs so slow that i had 60 messages in my outbox even after i left it running all night.The neighborhood also doesn't feel too safe at night.

<Content>Don't believe those "terrible" and "okay, but..." reviews! I just returned from a one-night stay at the Chandler Inn and was pleasantly surprised by the value I got for a fair price (for Boston).The day before I went to Boston I checked the TripAdvisor and was shocked by the possibilities of what to expect. I was very surprised and found the negative comments totally without foundation. I've traveled extensively in Europe for over 30 years, as well as throughout the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and, most recently, Japan. Yes, the hotel is old in comparison to the generic boxes with fancy lobbies and atriums. However, the room was clean, the bed was what I love (firm, not a giant pillow), but quite basic. Yes, the bathroom is small - but I wasn't there to spend time in the bathroom. The old fashioned tile was sparkling and spotless. Both elevators are new and efficient. They don't have a restaurant in the hotel itself, but you receive a voucher for $5 to use in a coffee shop around the corner. The location at first seems to be removed from everything, but it's about a 5 minute walk to the theater district and, depending on lights and street crossing times, about 10 minutes from the Boston Common. As a travel agent who can sometimes get discounts at major hotels, I was more than satisfied with the Chandler Inn and would recommend it to clients I know well enough to know that they would enjoy this location. Oh, and for the paper-thin walls?? I never once even heard a sound from another room or from people passing in the corridor. Don't expect the Ritz (or it's prices) and you should be happy with this property.

<Content>Excellent Value For The Price This hotel, although not a 5 star hotel, is very much worth the money. It was clean, the staff was nice and the location was excellent. Just a short walk to the subway, next to the theatre district, 5-7 minutes from Newbury st. Yes the bathroom was small but for the price, you cannot complain. I would recommend this hotel to budget travellers and students.

<Content>Worst hotel I have ever been in. Do not stay in this hotel unless you enjoy lying awake all night listening to people in nearby rooms having sex. The walls are so thin it sounds like they are in the room with you. Horrible uncomfortable beds, bathrooms needed cleaning, room tiny. I've never staying in such a horrible hotel before.

<Content>Good hotel for the price My husband and I stayed at the Chandler hotel in early October. The room was a good size, the bathroom a little small but had a very good shower, both were clean. The staff were very helpful.It was about 10 mins walk to Newbury Street with all its shops.The only thing that might put me off going again was the bar downstairs. The Sunday night was very loud at kicking out time, about 2am. It might have been to do with it being Columbus Day the next day so there was no need to rush off home.Billy's diner a couple of doors away did a good cheap breakfast.Overall a good hotel for the money.

<Content>PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE!! The Chandler Inn changed my room 3 times - I reserved a non-smoking room, and was placed in a smoking room. The halls, even in non-smoking, stink of stale smoke. There was no hot water(!) in my bathroom. The beds have 1 sheet and no mattress pad. The pillows are stained and have 1 pillow case, no cover. The bathroom has mold all over the tub lining. The noisy wall-unit air conditioner serves useful only as a noise-blocker for the bar below the hotel.

<Content>great stay, great staff , great location, great price Spent the first 4 nights of our trip in this hotel and for the cash we paid it was great the location was great for the centre of town and for the 'T' stops. the staff were very friendly and gave us some good advice. The room we had was a corner room which has a much better view so try and request this. The bathroom is on the small side but your on holiday you don't spend 24 hrs in the loo !! It is a very mixed hotel i.e straight, gay, old, young but if you are prejudice then just don't book it and it might stop the bad review this place has gotten. The sheets were clean as were the towels the tea and coffee facilities were fine and the bed was comfy would stay again when visiting..great wee gem of place.

<Content>No complaints! My husbond and I stayed at this hotel this september, and had a really good time. The facility was just how we thought it would be. The staff is very helpful and always smiling, and their recommendations on places to eat and spots to see turned out to be good advice.We didn't expect any luxury, and there was none, but the room was clean, we slept well and the location is pretty central and also quiet for such a big city.We think that the Chandler Inn is good value for money.

<Content>Good value for Boston I was there for two nights at the end of July 2005. I think it's a fairly decent place for the price they charge, compared to what the hotel rooms go for in Boston at the chain hotels. The rooms are smallish, but mine was very clean and appeared to be recently renovated. There is a gay sports bar next to the hotel and it was fairly busy most times. Staff were ok, but for some reason my room did not get cleaned when I was there but front desk sent me up new towels. No apologies really, just that they would speak to the manager and he would talk to the maid the next day. They still ask you to leave your key at the desk when you leave, I guess it's to cut down on lost keys. I didn't mind, and each time I walked in the door the desk clerk recognized me and handed my key without me having to tell him anything. Free coffe in the lobby, but that was about it. They have put in new elevators now as well (8 story building). I found it to be a great location all in all.

<Content>Never Again Travel agent recommended this place for a weekend with a female friend (not my girlfriend!) who wanted to just do some sightseeing and get away. The twin room we booked didn't materialize - one double, no option to change it. Ended up doing the routine like in that old Clark Gable movie. TV reception basically nonexistent. Small room. No restaurant, so no breakfast. Gay bar. We tried everywhere else downtown to move to, everything was booked. Would have paid anything to leave. Stay away.

<Content>Only if there is nothing else available.... Considering the high prices in hotels in Boston, if you are looking for somewhere to stay for the night, the Chandler Inn was ok.... there is major need for improvement though. Can't stay more than a night there though. The sheets, towels was dirty, the bathroom and room was small. The parking situation in horrible in the area. I ended up getting a parking violation ticket because the spaces with meters in the area turn into resident parking after 6pm. The only good thing about it was that it is walking distance from Copley, Newbury and Boston Commons. I will definetly think about whether I will stay there again. Only if there is nothing else price friendly.

<Content>Tiny room and bathroom We stayed for 2 nights at the Chandler Inn. The staff is very nice and the location is great, within blocks of the T. There is no parking. Altho it is advertised as a Bb, there is no food served. the rooms are TINY, hard for 2 people not to get in each other's way. the bathroom was even TINIER with no room to put stuff. the sheets didn't fit right but the bed was confortable. TV was mediocre with very few channels. l doubt if l would stay there again (maybe alone) due to the size of the room and bathroom.

<Content>Please avoid Chandler Inn's location is good but the actual accomodations are very depressing. Sheets and towels look to be 100 years old. It's clear that the owners haven't put a dime into it in many years. High-priced, even in a pricey town like Boston, for what you get (coffee and tea is for free, but no food, no parking, etc.).

<Content>good area, but small rooms with uncomfortable beds We stayed at the Chandler Inn recently for 5 nights. The price is good for the area, and the room was clean. The Back Bay/South End stop on the Orange Line of the T is a short walk from the hotel, which was great. The room was small, especially the bathroom, which was tiny. The TV in the room wasn't the best. It's cable TV, so I'm not sure how the reception was bad, but some channels were so bad you couldn't watch them and there weren't any pay-per-view movies or anything like that. Some people won't care about TV, but just thought I鈥檇 mention it. We could handle the small bathroom and noisy air conditioner (window unit) again, but the bed was uncomfortable, to the point where we weren't getting a good night's sleep. If we were in town again for, say 2 nights, and wanted to stay in that area again, we might stay at the Chandler Inn again. However, if we were going to stay for longer than 2-3 nights, we'd have to stay somewhere else with more comfortable beds.

<Content>Pleasant Surprise! As a former Boston resident I was aware of the pitfalls of many Boston hotels: overpriced and mediocre. On a recent trip to Boston I was pleasantly surprised by both the value and quality of service of this quaint South End inn. We were warmly greeted by Kevin who had fabulous restaurant recommendations--definitely go around the corner to the Berkley Perk for a delicious breakfast and cup of coffee! The parking was never a problem as we found many open spaces right by the hotel. There were also many parking garages very close by. The staff was friendly and when we called up for an iron it arrived in minutes. In addition, the Boston Globe (even the Sunday edition) was delivered to our doorstep every morning. A nice, personal touch that endeared me to the Chandler. I highly recommend the Chandler for those looking for high quality at an extremely reasonable price.
