<Content>Reasonable We had gone for a family vacation to Singapore and stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in last week of Oct'08. Entrance and reception was not very pleasing and we thought that we had made a mistake. Overall the Hotel has a worn out look.When we finally got to the room, we were pleasantly surprised as the room was big with a huge bed, where I could sleep comfortably with wife and a young kid. Rooms had all basic necessities and view from our room was also good.Best part of the hotel is their pool area and one could relax there and have a beer or cofee without much of disturbance.I liked this hotel due to its room and pool area besides we got this at a very cheap rate of SGD 130/Night.If you don't expect much, it is a nice property with good location.

<Content>Tired,old, lobby smells upon entering,restaurant was mediocre! I booked thu an Asian hotel booking service. I got stuck in Bangkok during the Airport closure,had to travel from Thailand to Singapore by several busses over a 40 hour period. The hotel was infomed of my hardship and inability to arrive for mt first nights stay. They would not credit me for the first night upon arrival even though I did inform them in advance. My first stay at this hotel and I didn't realize it only had a three star rating. It should be reduced to two stars! I have camped outdoors and had more comfort. The Asian Hotel Booking service has not responded to several e-mails and this is my second time booking thru an Asian Travel Service and having a problem. I'll not do it again.

<Content>Golden Rip Off! When we arrived at Singapore Airport on Dec. 10th the Singapore Hotel Assoc. booked us in this hotel at a rate of $150 per night. When we asked to extend one more day they would not keep the rate the same - it went to $180 plus 17% tax. Even speaking to management did not help. We have since learned that there are much lower rates than even the $150 online. For the extra $50 they made on us they turned us into very unhappy customers.The room and hotel itself were fine and it was a great location. Just be very careful about what you pay!

<Content>What you pay for, you get!! I was searching for an affordable hotel that had good reviews in Tripadvisor. This hotel appeared to be a good place to stay and by all accounts it was. It is in great area of Singapore, close to the Arab and Little India areas, so plenty of great eating spots, markets etc.Having just stayed at an up market hotel in Singapore, my expectations were realistic considering the price difference. When I arrived the hotle is clean, relatively tired, however they have everything you expect of a hotel. Reception was fast, however they booked me into a room with 2 single beds having requested a double on expedia. The room with the Single beds was below average with carpet that needed repair and a smell as though it had not been slepped in for some time. I was quickly moved to another room on level 15, which was great, with a King Bed. The room was clean, however nothing to get excited about, great for one night.

<Content>Great Hotel Visited Singapore September 26-29 and booked Landmark because of an exceptional deal with Expedia. Needless to say, because of previous comments, was a bit wary but how wrong could you be? Perhaps the secret is to book the executive rooms because they certainly are spacious (you can upgrade on check in). The use of the executive lounge is a bonus with free drinks and nibbles. Breakfast is also served here and was a peaceful orderly event of an extremely high standard. The staff were marvellous - very friendly and helpful - can also endorse the review regarding bell boy desk - they were a laugh a minute and everybody loves British football!!The hotel is well positioned for MRT and all modes of transport and the taxis certainly are cheap. Singapore is a beautiful clean place and I would have no hesitation in staying at the Golden Landmark on a return visit.

<Content>Golden Landmark in Singapore Location of the Golden Landmark hotel is excellent. It is near the shopping area for great bargains and the MRT is 2 blocks from the hotel. The room was spacious, clean and nice. What I got was the deluxe room and was really nice with big beds too. It was a real value for money. The hotel staff was helpful most specially the bellhop who help us when we had to store our luggage after we had checked out. They also helped us call a taxi for the airport. If you have time, the hotel also gives a free Heritage Tour via the hop on hop off bus for hotel guests, 2 persons per room FREE! I will always recommend the hotel to my friends, maybe their other properties in Singapore are just as good.

<Content>rip-off We were arriving at the airport around midnight and were in need of a place to stay, so we made a booking right at the airport hotel agency. We chose Golden Landmark because it seemed to be the best value hotel which turned out to be a big mistake. Once appeared there, we were briefed that we have to pay for the extra bed which we had not been told when booking and moreover 10 Euros accessorily because we booked at the airport. We got informed that we would get breakfast until 10:00h (actually it was until 10:30h) but the Receptionist didn鈥檛 mention that we will be charged for that seperately. When they presented the invoice we suddenly got aware that it was even worse: we had to pay tax in addition which - again 鈥?hadn鈥檛 been indicated before, and even cleaning the room was stated accounts in addition. It's not that we mind paying for services but we do mind if we get constantly surprised by things to pay that we hadn't been acquainted beforehand. The hotel rooms are average, room service was poor (we asked for 3 blankets but just got one). I have to grant a point in terms of luggage storage after checkout which worked perfectly.

<Content>Great hotel - if you're single The Golden Landmark was the 3rd hotel we stayed at during our 19 night Singapore/KL holiday and although it was only a three night stay, it was probably the least enjoyable experience out of the three.We selected this hotel because it was very well located to the MRT station (5 minute walk), Bugis Junction and markets, and because it was reasonably priced.The entrance to the hotel was a bit of a treasure hunt because it was not located on either of the two main streets, but rather down the quiet side street. The foyer was also located upstairs on level 3, which we could reach by elevator or escalator.I should mention that even though the hotel has four elevators, it was still sometimes a long wait for a lift. It also didn't help that the doors only stay open for a very very short period of time, so if you are not quick enough to stick your hand in between the doors, or if no one is pressing the door open for you from the inside, it is very easy to miss your lift, something that happened to us and many other guests during our stay.Checking in did take quite a while, and after we were all assigned rooms, we found our four rooms close to each other and on the 11th floor. We requested rooms away from the elevators, but unfortunately found that one of our rooms was next to the lifts and my room was the next one over. So yes, we were woken up a few times during the night by noisy guests coming back early in the morning.One of the first things we noticed about our standard room was that the air-conditioner gauge was not working. Because the temperature was stuck at a degree that we felt was a bit uncomfortable, we eventually called someone to fix it, which he did (after we insisted twice), but from then we actually left the air-conditioner off because we found the temperature setting had only two settings - arctic and off...The room looked a little old, was modestly furnished with some of it looking a little worse for wear. Our room had a one particular table that I had placed my suit case apon, but after closer inspection, I removed it because I did not want to be billed for a broken table. What took the cake though, was the two small single beds for my wife and I. Our other travel companions consisted of another couple also suffered the same fate and although we didn't bother trying to ask for another room, I overheard three different conversations during our stay of the desk clerks apologising to guests that there were no double beds available. We thought about joining the beds together, but as there was a bedside table bolted to the wall, we decided it was just easier to have some 'alone time' from each other during our short stay.The room wasn't very big, but there was enough room to walk around without bumping into everything. It was also clean and quiet with very little noise from outside penetrating the window, except for one morning. We were there for the end of Ramadan and because the hotel is located next to a decent sized mosque, we were woken up very early one morning from their prayers, celebrating the end of Ramadan.The bathroom was pretty much standard and clean, although the towels weren't the best quality. Maybe a bit of fabric softener would have be helpful.The hotel is situated on top of a small three floor shopping centre, but the shops are mainly for the locals and besides a few souvenir shops, they consisted of goods and services that us tourists weren't interested in. When it came to shopping, Bugis Junction and Bugis markets was only 5 minutes away.We did not have breakfast at the hotel, but there was a food court across the road and again Bugis Junction (and Starbucks) just 5 minutes further down the road.Our rooms were cleaned whenever we left the sign out (which wasn't designed very well and would always fall off the door handle whenever you turned the handle), and check out again was a slow process, this time mainly due to waiting in line.The Golden Landmark is a very well located hotel, and although it served our purposes well by giving us a clean, somewhat comfortable room, in a great location and at a reasonable price, I found the staff a little distant, not very friendly, and not too interested in our concerns or requests.

<Content>Give it and the attached SukMan Travel a miss... The hotel itself is old and in need of refurbishment. Its interior suggests days of glory but...The facilities are tired, with the 'gym' consisting of four cardio machines and the main bar better viewed in the dark. The pool does look good from a distance.The staff were average at best although when compared with the exceptional hospitality I experienced elsewhere in Singapore, they were found to be sadly lacking. Consistent with that thought, my one room service order was incorrect.The onsite travel agency Sukman is to be avoided. They endeavoured to charge me $280 for a service I ended up attending to for $70 and while I understand the need to make a profit, a 400% markup presents as somewhat excessive. Moreover, they lied in telling me all flights to Viet Nam were booked for the following three days. I should be clear that I'm uncertain Sukman has anything to do with the Golden Landmark apart from having entered into a tenancy agreement. That said, avoid them.

<Content>Was good value for money... We booked earlier on in the year (about 8-9 months in advance of our stay), and the price was about AUD $102. Considering the proximity to the Bugis MRT (rail system), we thought it was great value. It is an older hotel, and functional, and worth the AUD$100. However, prices have now gone up considerably (now over AUD$150) and if we had the choice now we would probably look around to see if we could get better hotels for the same price. At just over $100 it is worth it, but probably not worth what is being charged now.The room I stayed in was either feezing cold (aircon on any setting) or fine (aircon off). However, as I usually get cold easily, having the aircon off was fine by me.Check-in was a little slow. Check-out was fine.Bell Desk was fine.Didn't eat in the restaurant, so can't comment on that.The best part of the hotel was how close it is to Bugis Junction and therefore Bugis MRT.

<Content>Great Singapore Value and Location Singapore hotels have gotten very pricey, but the Golden Landmark is a good value. It's within a short walking distance of the Bugis MRT, so transportation is convenient, too. They offer an upgrade to a club floor for $S30, which is worth it. I've stayed here before in regular rooms, but the club rooms have been refurbished and the extra charge gets you a nice breakfast in the club room, cocktails in the evening, high speed internet access (100 mbs) and a one-time suite pressing (very nice after a very long flight). The pool is nice. There's a small but adequate fitness center. All in all, a good deal, though not a fancy hotel.

<Content>Reasonable, but avoid the standard rooms I stayed here twice, once at end of August and also in September. My first stay was in a deluxe room, which had recently been refurbished, and was very clean, although lighting seem to be somewhat dim. On my return stay, I was allocated the standard room that I had booked, which was well overdue for renovation, with stained carpets, scratched furniture and power points hanging off the walls. Location is good, with MRT a short walk away. I did not use the pool or other facilities during my stay so I cannot comment on these. Reception staff and room service was relatively quick and helpful. As a budget option, this hotel is okay, however I strongly suggest upgrading to a deluxe room, as the standard rooms are very old and shabby.

<Content>Good value for money, great location I stayed there in Sept 2007 for 10 days, the check in was quick, the room were clean and the size was big, the pool was great and have good view, the Indian resturant have nice food and the price is reasonable The location of the hotel is great just few minutes to Bugis Mrt station and walking distance to arab street and little India....where you can enjoy Arabic, indian and Malay foodThe taxis are available in the main door, or from the street directly and it will take 5-8 minutes to reach Orchard Road, I stayed there with my wife and two kids, we enjoyed our time.

<Content>A great stop-over hotel Our stay at this hotel was a pleasant experience after reading some of the reviews on here. The reception staff were generally helpful, but did forget to do things a few times when we asked - room took a while to get ready, an item from laundry took a number of phone calls before it arrived.Situated in a good location about 200m from Bugis Junction and MRT station. The pool area was great after a humid day sightseeing and was clean with towels provided.The rooms were large and clean with very comfy beds.Would recommend this hotel for a short stop-over.Note if you book through Hotels.com for a room to accommodate children, the hotel expect the child to sleep in your bed no matter how old they are. It was only after some heated discussion with reception that they agreed not to charge us for a fold-a-way bed.

<Content>Big Rip Off !! We stayed at the Golden Landmark during a short weekend break in Singapore this Aug. The booking was done through their reservations desk via the website - which we thought was smart on our part but little did we know !The bad parts ? - - The reservations did not tell us about an additional tax ( on top of the regular 17%) which was applicable on every night basis- The room was badly maintained - housekeeping did not clean the bathroom on a SINGLE day of the 3 days we spent there, nor were the so called 'complimentary' tea  coffee sachets replaced.My sister ordered room service on the first night, the tray was not cleared till the next day evening...and that too only when we called and complained !- The breakfast was a crime, for the 15SGD you pay for it...and ofcourse, u pay a service charge on that as well ! Actually, there is a service charge on everything, do keep in mind...- On checking out, our bill included an amount for two telephone calls made from our room...during a time we were not even in the hotel ! Had to spend 20mins telling them why we wouldnt pay for it...before they agreed to strike it off..The good parts ?Not enough for me to make points...the location near the MRT I guess ( though we never got around to using it) - though taxis can be quite difficult to get near the entrance...it's a one way street, and most cab drivers did not want to get in...so would drop us off some distance away..Summary - You can get a 100 times better experience in other hotels which cost marginally more...so dont waste your money - unless you dont really mind dirty bathrooms :)

The breakfast in the poolside was fantastic.I booked for a double room, but the hotel gave us a triple room without extra charges. Our room was really spotless with complete toiletries. The view from our room was fantastic overlooking the big mosque.

<Content>GOOD VALUE CONSIDERING THE GREAT LOCATION Have stayed in this hotel about 7 times over the last 23 years, usually for 2 weeks at a time. Had not stayed there for the last 6 years due to better package deals using other hotels. Was apprehensive when I saw that recent reviews suggested it had gone down in quality, and it was missing from a few UK brochures, previously have been given a good 3 star rating bt Kuoni and British Airways. Decided to give it one last bash, had already booked flight via Edinburgh Travel agent who managed to find the hotel being sold via Quantas Airline holidays brochure, they were wllling to sell the hotel alone at bargain of 拢25 per person per night. Had as always, great 2 weeks holiday in our beloved Singapore for the 16th time, melt into the country, you will love it, nicer people are hard to find anywhere on the plant.Anyway, I digress.... the hotel had not really changed, room was fine, overall hotel getting a little shabby, but if you are the type that want 4/5 star hotels on holiday and enjoy the luxury, then its not for you. Staff smile away, a friendly smile to them usually helps, sometimes the formal nature of business that the Chinese race uses, can be off-putting for westerners, in particular Hong Kong, once you understand that, then they dont seems so informal, just different culture. But...if you want a solid hotel with all the basics while you spend most of each day out of it, then the Landmark hits all the right notes. Gym nothing to write home about, pool best in morning as in shade afternoon. The huge factor is LOCATION !!!, I have stayed over the years in most areas of Singers, and this always draws us back. Main roads either side of the hotel give you perfect bus connections either direction on the one way system. The MRT tube train station at Bugis, is about 300 yards away. The shopping in this area is excellent, Bugis Street market (day  night) nearby (eat in the food court within - it is now great value, was a tourist rip-off for long enough). Below the hotel is a 3 level shopping arcade well worth a visit, plenty of late night shops nearby. Loads of eating options in the Arab Street area opposite the front of the hotel. We shall be back to Singers next year as usual, and the Golden Landmark will do fine. Its like an old favourite coat to us, getting shabbier, but does the business and hits all the basic points you need, in the best location in Singers. Over the last 23 years I have watched Singapore hotels getting more expensive as its occupancy rate is very high, being a huge transit stop-over desination. So, getting this hotel in this location is a bargain. Being a good Scotsman, I much prefer to channel the saved money from not going to a fancier hotel, into holiday entertainment on the ground, Camera, Jewellery and food, no contest - gimme the Landmark !!!!, arf arf. Some people like the Hotel Limo to meet them instead of far cheaper airport Taxi, some like champagne in their room etc, depends how you cut your cloth, some people even like to indulge themselves in a bloody cruise where they chomp and drink their way on a long metal boat for 2 weeks, visit various ports, trip off onto a bus and see that Country for 3 hours, then back on the boat, enough said on that !!!, ahem..Each to their own - So, have no fear, go without over-expectation of the Landmark Hotel, and you will be more than pleasantly surprised when you realise how you have landed in the best area to pivot your way around.Hae fun..........arf

<Content>Could have been better I stayed at this hotel for one night in April, then returned in May for 4 nights. The first time I stayed I could not fault the hotel, but on returning we had problems with them putting us in the wrong room, then moving us to a room that was dirty and unclean. They then gave us a choice of 4 rooms to pick from, which in time took over an hour to resolve. My disapointment was that they were not appologetic and did not offer any sort of compensation to us, which would have been appreciated. I also was not happy on our last day, as we had arranged a late check out, but were walked in on by the hotel staff at 7.30am of that morning, much to our embarrassment. We then recieved a few phone calls and hang ups which really got me angry, but again no apology was offered. The location of the hotel is excellent, but I would look at alternative hotels for my next visit to Singapore.

<Content>decent hotel for decent price The Golden Landmark has nice spacious rooms with nice views. The room we stayed in was a twin and there was lots of room for all our luggage. It has a desk, mini fridge, and chair. The bathroom was really dimly lit but this didn't prove to cause any problems at all. The location isn't particularly ideal for shopping on Orchard Rd unless you catch a cab or bus.

<Content>Good hotel near the city We stayed for a day in Golden Landmark hotel. We found the hotel worthy of the tariff we paid. The room was very spacious and well maintained. The view from the 18th floor was good. The club facility gave us access to coffee, breakfast and internet. As our flight was in the evening, we needed a late check out and the staff was very helpful. Overall a good experience!!!

<Content>Fallen standards, but still decent. I have stayed in this hotel several times, and it used to be an excellent value for money hotel. This year, I noticed the standards had dropped a bit, there were cobwebs on the ceilings, the bathroom tiles were chipped, the room amenities much less than what they used to be. However, it still is a good hotel for the money. You will probably not have any nasty surprises. But be careful of their online booking system. I booked for a bed  breakfast rate, but when the booking was done I re-checked with the hotel and they said breakfast was not included. Considering breakfast is SGD 15 pp, we decided to skip breakfast at the hotel and eat outside. There are plenty of eating options outside with a nice bakery/coffee shop at Raffles hospital complex just opposite, and Bugis Village is just a 5 min walk away. The location is great, central, and 5 min from Bugis MRT station. The hotel is renovating some of the rooms, so if they can work their way back to their original standards, I will be staying in this hotel again. All in all, not a bad choice if you don't want to spend too much.

<Content>Very basic I've stayed at many hotels in asia and this hotel is a very typical asian style hotel. It is very very average and nothing spectacular. The key selling point is the location is very good. The hotel is very basic and you get what you pay for. The front desk was very nice to us and checked us in before 2pm which was very nice.

<Content>Very nice hotel Everything was very fine. Check-in only 5 minutes. Nice staff. Clean room, with a fantastic view to the harbour. We had requested executive 17-18 floor. The lounge was good with free internet, free drinks and fine snacks, and very polite and effective staff in the lounge. Breakfast is better in the restaurant. All you need, fresh fruit, bacon + egg, and much, much more. We stayed 2 times, 3 nights, and for sure, we will stay at Golden Landmark next time visiting Singapore. Very good value for your money.

<Content>not worth it This is a dingy place and you could do much better for the money.My room was ok but only just... I was offered 6pm check out by Expedia (subject to availability) if I upgraded. I did. On arrival I was told 2pm was the best they could do. I asked if the hotel was fully booked, I was told it was... Really?? Not giving up I asked what would happen if I rang the hotel and asked to book a room... Eventually the receptionist conceeded that the hotel wasn't fully booked, so there was availability, so i could stay to 6pm. I realise this is all very dull but that's the point. I can't be bothered with that kind of c**p in this day and age.The pool is okay. The gym is small.The location is the hotel's only redeeming feature. Near Little India, Arab Street and Bugis Street.Don't stay here. Spend your money somewhere else

<Content>A good hotel for the money!! Booked through Ratestogo.com. We arrived 5 hours before check in time, the room wasnt available, but at executive one was available. So we upgraded.. and it was indeed a gud decision. The room was quite spacious, pretty decent breakfast, the executive lounge had drinks and munchies all round the day which was useful. It is near a metro station... but we found taxis comfortable and reasonbly priced... so we mostly used taxi or walked. The bed was comfortable.. and bathroom very clean and nice. Will definitely go back.

<Content>Acceptable Hotel The Golden Landmark is a hotel located a bit off from the main commercial area in Orchard Road but is within walking distance to Arab Street and Bugis. Stayed here for two nights in late-2006. Check-in wasn't too good. It took a while and the staff handling reception was a bit rude. The room itself is average. It comes with standard amenities such as a toiletry kit, slippers, etc. It's quite obvious that they had some refurbishing done in the rooms so the furniture at least got a new coat of paint, though it could use some more refinement. The room was also a bit dark and during our second night the bathroom light did not work properly. There was a breakfast buffet but the selection was not that great compared to other hotels I've stayed in. Overall, I probably wouldn't stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Golden Landmark, great location but packed I stayed in this hotel on Nov. 18 to the 21st. The rooms were average, and pretty expensive for what you got. The location is good, right buy the Bugis mtr stop. Be advised though, the place is packed, and we were the only westerners there.

<Content>Great Location. Rude and Horrible staff. Stayed at GL two weeks back. Wonderful location ; BUGIS MRT within 2 minutes walk. Rooms are decent enough and clean.The worst part is the management. All the staffs are extremely rude and have no concern for the guests. Although we booked way in advance, we were made to wait for almost 2 hours and they offered the same excuse to other waiting guests  Room not ready. We had booked a triple room but they made arrangements for the third bed in another 2 hours. When asked about it, all they had to say :  You booked through travel agent and not through us. What a horrible excuse.Avoid this hotel also because its overcrowded. The reception is very noisy and they are least bothered.Its only the location for which they are cashing in .....

<Content>Avoid the Golden Landmark. We have just returned from an extremely unacceptable 3 night stay at the Golden Landmark Hotel, Singapore booked through the hotels.com website. On arrival we were warned that there was refurbishment worktaking place on the upper floors, and there would possibly be some noise during the hours of 0900-1800. The hotels.com website statesRenovation Notice. The Executive Club rooms will be undergoing renovations until the end of April 2006. We had booked and paid for a renovated Executive Club room on the upper floors for comfort and relaxation. On entering the room we were welcomed by loud building work noise. This wasn't background noise, it was loud and very close -one floor below I believe. As we had just flown long haul from London we were hoping to rest, but the noise made this totally impossible. We immediately asked Reception for a room change and/or a refund but were told that only non-renovated standard rooms were available on the lower floors and no refund could be offered as the booking was made via hotels.com. We asked the Duty Manager why the hotel offeredexecutive club rooms to well paying guests, knowing that building work was taking place in close proximity. His only reply was that a lot of guests are sightseeing or out on business during the day. This is obviously not the case for people who are on holiday, have just arrived exhausted after a long haul flight, and are hoping to rest in a quiet and comfortable room during the heat of the day! When pushed, the Duty Manager offered us an alternative day room for use during the day only. Each morning at 0900, tired after being woken by the noise, we had to present ourselves at reception to collect the key and return it again in the evening. The day room was uncomfortable, unclean and stank of cigarette smoke - it was barely used. Our stopover in Singapore was supposed to be a stress free and relaxing holiday, and also incorporated a birthday celebration. The situation at the Golden Landmark completely ruined the experience for us both. When a formal complaint was made to hotels.com they offered us a smallrefund that did not even equate to one nights stay. We advise travellers to avoid the Golden Landmark and the hotels.com website.

<Content>Great location, 3-star comfort The location can't be faulted - just 5mins walk from Bugis MRT, and the area's vibrant night market. Check-in for our internet booked room was quick and business-like. The room was what we expected for the price . It was comfortable and fairly large, with decent attached bathroom, but lacking in any kind of modern style or frills. We found the centrally controlled air-con freezing. The swimming pool is a good size, and there is a nice little outdoor terrace by the pool for drinks. Overall, a safe bet, but look elsewhere for a luxury/treat hotel.

<Content>Not Bad Stayed in Golden Landmark for 2 nights and while I can't say that I loved the placed I can't say I hated it either. The room was very nice with a great view. It was on the 11th floor and offered a good view of the Sultan Mosque and Arab Street. I found the staff to be friendly enough unlike some other reviewers. The only problem was at the breakfast place where they are under-staffed (I guess) and there the waiters were very unsmiling and a wee bit hostile. The breakfast was strictly ok and nothing more. Overall, not a bad place since it is at a very good location. The Victoria Street wholesale market is just across the road where you find good and cheap dry fruits. Also at walking distance is Bugis where the shopping is good. Little India was 15-20 minutes walk away. We liked the whole experience!

<Content>OK hotel, Bad stuff, Great Location!! Stayed at Golden Landmark for 2 nights on our way back from Bali. Paid around USD140 including taxes for a deluxe room w/o bfast.I asked about late check out during check in and paid extra SGD40for 4pm check-out. We got a 19th floor corner room, which was tiny and dark thanks to a very small window. The stuff could not care less. No smile or greetings whatsoever. The concierge refused to call a cab for us saying that it would take longer to get one by calling. He rather advised us to just wait outside the entrance. At that point, I called a cab from the pay phone in the lobby and the cab shows up in 5 minutes!!!!But the location was great and very convenient. It is only 5 min walk to MRT and also close to shopping places like Bugis street and Sim Lim square. I think the only plus point of this hotel is the location. Stay away if you can!!

<Content>Nice But Nothing Special I booked this hotel via Lastminute and our stay was okay but nothing special. Our check in took a long time and the staff didn't seem particularly friendly. The room was fine - a bit older but everythingworked. They are currently refurbishing rooms though. The room had a lovely view. The staff member who brought up our bags helped find an extra blanket which was nice. Our check out took quite a while andthere didn't seem to be any order as to who was being dealt with first.Apart from the experience at the front desk the hotel offered fairly good value.

<Content>Depressing hotel Passing through Singapore essentially in transit (arrive 3pm, leave 8am the day after) we went for a value for money hotel. I got cheap I suppose, but not value. Following the advice of earlier reviews on here we booked the executive floor for the better rooms and obvious evening drinks. The room was small, dark (one small window in the corner) with a light brown/tobacco paint on the walls, similar net curtains and the plesant sound of pneumatic drills till 7pm. This after being ignored at the Club floor check in area by the regular counter staff untill they told us it's not working there. Eventually went into the fridge, or the excutive club room, where people wrapped themselves to keep warm! A very limited food (cheese and ham slices, one bowl local dish) and more limited drinks , the same depressing colour scheme had me wishing for the early dpearture. I know it is being refreshed so I dread to think how tired the hotel was beforehand. By Singapore standards this was awful. The star was the only staff member dealing with the club lounge, who tried her best but was doing it with her hands effectively tied behind her back. I doubt she'll be ther long as no doubt will move on to a better hotel. It's cheap, but not value, strictly for those who enjoy being depressed.

<Content>Not worth the price Although it has a great location the hotel may have the most uncomfortable beds ever created. For the price...even booking on a hotels website with a reduced rate...i felt i was cheated. If I could go back, I would definitely spent the little bit extra and had a more relaxing experience elsewhere. If ammenities, personalized service, and comfort are in any way important to you...then skip it. I personally was travelling as a backpacker, plushing it up for a few days...and had a much more rewarding experience at my hostel, for 80% less of a price.

<Content>Poor service, quality for the price I stayed at the Golden Landmark on my latest visa run to Singapore. There was a convention or something in Singapore on that date, so my usual hotels were booked up. I booked through the hotel directly, and paid USD 200 for an Executive Room.I arrived tired after a delayed flight. Check-in was relatively quick. Then I asked the front desk if they could provide me with an envelope and keep my visa renewal package (passport, pictures, form, etc) for the agent to pick up early in the morning. The clerk sighed heavily and asked if I could just do it tomorrow. I was very taken aback; there were no other customers waiting to check in and several clerks just standing around. I've done this five times at other hotels, even later at night, and not one front desk clerk has ever made me feel to be a burden on their time. The room was OK. It was clearly an old, tired room that was spruced up with new fixtures. The renovation is ageing quickly; for example, the handle on the faucet was broken off. For comparison, the executive floor rooms are basically equal to or even worse than the regular Holiday Inn rooms. I did not see the regular Golden Landmark rooms.There is a breakfast offered in the Executive Lounge, located on the Executive floor (the breakfast is OK, but my room was right next to this dining area and the smell of frying woke me up at 6:30!) The Executive Lounge apparently also has soft drinks available all day, and cocktails in the evening, but I arrived too late to check this out. There is also an express checkout desk in the lounge, but when I went to check out there, no one was manning it. When I finally did check out downstairs,they tried the old scam of charging my bill in USD. If you don't know about this, google dynamic currency conversion. I asked them to rerun the charge in Singapore Dollars, and they did comply. I would not recommend the Golden Landmark Hotel. I found it unsatisfactory for an overnight stay, and can't imagine dealing with them for a longer stay.

<Content>Tired and average hotel I was disappointed with the quality of this hotel as compared with the price. Check in was perfunctory and there was no one to help with my very heavy bag, and questions were met with minimal assistance. The room itself was tired and felt grotty - carpets were stained and looked old. The room service was pretty good, and the pool was quite nice too. I wouldnt stay here again - i think you can get better deals for more upmarket hotels in Singapore.

<Content>Awful Service I received bad reveiws about this pace from the cab driver who took me to the hotel from the airport when i arrived in singapore and from a different cabbie on my way back. Rooms are not bad, but the service is awful. The receptionists were argumentative and the ppl stationed at the door were unwilling to help catch a taxi or load/unload luggage. The TV had 20 channels in all and only 3 of them were in English. There are several other good 3 star hotels in Singapore. Try any except this one.

<Content>Not a bad hotel While waiting to checkin (took about 30 minutes!) I asked a guy who was checking out about the hotel. he said it was average and suggested I pay the extra for an executive floor room. Im glad I did - the room was quite good. The only negative was that it had a very strong antiseptic smell. The club room was good - drinks and nibblies available all day and free internet. Staff were friendly and the breakfast was good.

<Content>Great place to stay My family and I stayed at the Golden Landmark for 5 days in July this year. Had a fantastic time. The hotel was actually better than we thought - had read a few reviews and was slightly worried at what we would find. The rooms were very spacious and had organised a interconnecting room for the teenage kids. Their first trip abroad. We booked directly with the hotel on line and after reading reviews ensured that we took our booking confirmation with us. This came in handy when trying to check out - as they were trying to get us to pay the changed rate - stuck to our guns and paid what we had booked for - but only because we had our confirmation paperwork when booked online through the hotel. The bathrooms were ok, after giving them a bit of a wash (something my husband does every where we stay), we had no problems. No complaints from the kids (which is where any would have come from). If you are planning on having the breakfast _ DO NOT BOOK AS PART OF HOTEL/ROOM PACKAGE. We were umming and ahhing about what to do and eventually decided to wait until we got there. When we asked about breakfast at the restaurant it worked out cheaper to pay cash directly to them $12 singaporean, compared to $22 when booking. Found the restaurant to be not too bad however the food from the local hawker centres was much much better and tastier. Just across the road (when go out the raffles hospital door) was a little lane way called Bali Lane. there is is restaurant type bar with out door seating - food was absolutely delicious - most of them cost about $8 singaporean. Found the tiger beer to be a bit expensive here, but averaged about $5-6 in the hawker centres. The rooms have tv - with movie channels in English and local sub titles - kids thought this was great and funny as they were not used to it. The people were lovely, The Bugis MRT is only 5 mins away, Bugis street night markets are a definite must for bargain hunting. Found Sim Lim square to be great for electronics - however MAKE SURE YOU COMPARE PRICES - before you buy and ensure that they are turned on before you leave. We got caught out with a couple of things. Didn't expect anything fancy - all wanted was larger room. Rooms had safes which we used and had no problems. No robes - but were never expected. However they did have slippers - didn't use. The pool was good and relaxing after running around all day. Wondered about the mosque across the road in regards to prayers (early mornings) didn't hear a thing. The only time we heard any prayers was in the afternoon when we were in the pool. Defintely can't wait to go back to Singapore and would definitely stay at the Golden Landmark again. Close to everything that we wanted and good for teenagers as well.

<Content>Could be much better We checked in at around 2:30PM and was told to wait for some minutes while the receptionist double checked if the hotel room had been cleaned. So we waited for 15 min (we sat on a couch just in front of the front desk), and didn't get any update on the room. We came back to the receptionist and then she told us that the room was ready, gave us 2 key cards, and even told us that there could be a room manager still doing some finishing touch in the room. To our surprise, the room door was open and the room was still dirty. We then left our luggages inside the room, lock the door, and reported the matter to the help desk (Ms. Nora). She came upstairs with us and found a cleaning service woman and told her to clean our room asap. We thought the problem was solved. But the second day when we returned to the hotel in the middle of the day to drop some shopping bags, we found our room door open, even when it looked like the room has been cleaned by room service, and no cleaner was in sight. We thought it was harmless. However, when we checked out and got the bill, we were charged for an international phone call that we never made! It looks like someone came inside our room and made the call easily since the door was left open! Maybe we could even say we were lucky that none of our belongings was stolen. It was really the worst experience we've ever had in a 4-star hotel!

<Content>Great hotel in good location near many of Singapore's ethnic districts! We stayed at the Golden Landmark for 4 nights while in Singapore on vacation and opted to spend just a little more extra (5 USD) per night for a room on the Executive Floor. We didn't see the rooms on the other floors, but my guess is that they were the same size - it's just that the Executive Floor rooms were recently refurbished (tastefully so) and you get free wireless internet and access to the Executive Lounge for free served continental (and more) breakfast, snacks in the afternoon and alcohol in the evening... as well as a few other goodies.We highly recommend the Executive Floor. Overall, the hotel's not much to look at from the outside with the Golden Landmark shopping center, but really beautiful on the inside with excellent service and a lovely indoor koi pond.The location is great - a block from Arab Street and within 5-10 minute walking distance to a variety of diverse districts (Little India, Chinatown) and 3-minute walk to the very clean and efficient MRT metro line at Bugis Street. Bugis is also great for a large outdoor market where you can find all kinds of great things and fascinating cool drinks to quench your thirst on those hot Singapore days. This hotel serves as a terrific base.Taxis are aplenty - just wait for one outside the lobby and it's very cheap to get to any major attraction in the area.

<Content>Singapore on the way home We came to the hotel from Malaysia. The check-in was ok and we were ok with the room facing the pool. The breakfirst was ok. After a day in the city we came back to find that no bathtowels were to find. I called the frontdesk and said We did get any towels, can you please bring us towels The lady at front desk sounded very tired and not friendly at all. After 15min, the doorbell rang, I opened the door. Outside is a man from the hotel staff not looking happy and the gives me the towels and walk away with out a word. I then realised that they have just given us one towel, so i call again. Aftert five minutes someone is banging on the door, very angy. The same man with an angry look and it feels like that we should be happy that they answered the call at all. Beside from that the hotel is ok. In their internet kiosk they don't have a printer and it coats 5 singspore dollar to use for an hour. In the same building there is a little store that sells drinks, candy and other stuff. There is coats for internet 2 singapore dollar an hour.The hotel is on subway line from the airport and it's not heavy to bring your stuff to and from the airport. The nearest station is only five minutes away.Would I stay at that hotel again ? No, I would pay a little more extra for better service.

<Content>Location and Value for Money Just returned from 2 nights stopover In Singapore. I picked this hotel because of its location to areas I had not visited worked out to be wonderful, Bugis street Markets everything you need and large shopping malls, our other favourite place Sim Lim Square within walking distance.As for the hotel checkin was swift shown to our room promply the only thing was we had two king single beds they had not put them together and I did complain. We Stayed on the executive floor 18 with drinks and breakfast included, room was big enough good views great blockout on window curtains. Staff in executive room were just wonderful and very helpful and patient.Pool area has recently been renovated and looked very nice.We would definetly stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Nice Hotel This was a nice looking hotel with beautiful chandalier in the lobby. Desk staff were pleasant enough. Hotel tour agent was very helpful and personally escorted us to the hop-on/hop-off bus so that we could travel cheaply around the city. Nice rooms with TV and minibar. Enjoyed our stay here.

<Content>A nice surprise, good value for money Check in Experience - Excellent.We arrived at the hotel at about 7:30am after a sleepless flight from Australia. We were worried about not being able to access our booked room until 2:00pm; without us even asking, the very polite lady at check-in told us that a room was available to us immediately. Yay! She also said we could use the free breakfast facilities (see below) that I didn't expect would be available to us until the next morning (our first official morning).The room was also a pleasant surprise. We upgraded to the Executive floors when booking. This entitled us to a renovated room; access to the Executive Lounge on the 18th floor at any time, which included free Internet, free continental breakfast, and free cocktails from 6 - 8pm each evening.The service from the staff in the Executive Lounge has been excellent.The room itself is on the small side of hotel rooms, but is clean, and recently renovated. The bed is very comfortable, and HUGE. Curtains are thick and block out the sun. Room service each day has been excellent, including some free snacks they left one day in the middle of our stay.We were worried initially about the location of the hotel, as we drove through the old shophouses of Arab Street in the cab on the way from the airport. But in fact, the location has been excellent. Bugis MRT is one block (a hospital!) away, and the transport in Singapore has proved to be excellent as promised. There are several restaurants nearby. Arab Street and all of its silk shops are literally on the next block. Cabs are cheap. There is also a major shopping centre at Bugis.We have a midnight flight out of Singapore tomorrow, and the hotel has extended our checkout time to 2pm. If we want to stay until 6pm, it will cost us only $60. At 6pm, we can then come to the Executive Lounge and have free cocktails until we need to leave for the airport!We found that the Golden Landmark is great value for money (you sacrifice staying in one of the trendier locations, such as Orchard Road, for a nice room at a cheaper rate; however, the location and price of the MRT makes that all fine, and everywhere is accessible and close) and would stay there again.

<Content>Simple, Basic, Value for money I recently stayed at this hotel. As mentioned by other reviewers (thanks folks!), this is a simple hotel. Value for money. Don't expect anything great, as you get what you paid for. It's fairly clean. Staff are responsive and polite (of course, guest should be curteous too). There is a Coffee house (Starbucks or Coffee Bean) nearby. Great Location! Very near Bugis MRT station. If you walk a little further up, you'll find Parco Bugis Junction (which houses Seiyu departmental store, a food court with affordable local and western favourites), other shopping boutiques/merchants (with trendy clothes, accesories and knick knacks), a Cold Storage supermarket and also Watson's Drugstore/Pharmacy.

<Content>Geat Stopover choice - try the Exec Floor upgrade Whilst travelling to Australia from London we wanted somwhere to break that long, arduous flight, without breaking the bank, so spotted the Golden Landmark on TA. We opted for a room on the Exec Floor - only 拢9 more than a standard room - and got lots of little added extras, such as late check-out, so we could use the pleasant roof top pool, free internet usage in the Exec Club Lounge (and free snacks and coffee there too). The location is excellent being only minutes walk to a subway station and a short stroll to the Arab Quarter for a meal out under the stars and walking distance to Orchard Road. The bathroom was on the snug side, but the rooms were spacious and clean and the bed very comfortable. After a good night'ssleep in Singapore, nice dinner and refreshing swim we got to Melbourne feeling refreshed.

<Content>Recommended for a Short Stay Definitely a good location for Gadget shoppers coz it's very near Sim Lim. We stayed only for overnight but the $$ paid is kinda worth it. My only disappointment were those stains on the toilet that cannot be removed but it's tolerable for a short stay. I can't comment on the food coz we didn't avail the breakfast. If we go back to Singapore soon, might consider going back to that hotel again.

<Content>Good Location We stayed for one night at this hotel. The hotel lobby is situated inside an old shopping mall (Golden Landmark Building). For SD167 (including tax, etc) it is a little bit expensive for budget travelers. They have screwed up our reservations for non-smoking room even though I have personally called the hotel desk for reservation, confirming a non-smoking room. We insisted we be compensated, so they gave us a better room at the top floor (smoking room but found out there were no foul smelling cigarrette smell, luckily). Desk service seems slow, need to improve on their efficiency to be able to cope with simultaneous check-ins during peak hours. Otherwise, room is spacious (twin beds at level 19, smoking), and 3 mins walk to Bugis MRT station, 3 mins walk to Bugis Junction, Bugis street markets. Don't hesitate to ask for compensation if rooms are unsatisfactory (saw lots of bad reviews from various hotel booking websites). We're not planning to stay at this hotel if we plan to go to Spore next time. Day trip is good enough.

<Content>Well we liked it! The first time we stayed in Singapore we stayed at another hotel further away and gor tired of the 15 minute walk to the MRT, We spoted the Golden Landmark and decided to stay there next time because of its good location to shops and transport.We enjoyed it very much. The hotel is quite basic compared to other asian hotels but the room was clean, the service was quick friendly and excellent. Our TV wasnt working and a repair man was sent up 5 minutes after calling reception.We have stayed there twice now and are going again in May 2007.Singapore as a tourist is an amazing place. I feel its illogical to pay top dollar for a hotel where you only sleep and shower. The most important aspects for me are location and as long as the hotel is clean and secure then I am happy. I really feel the Golden landmark fits the bill nicely.The other advantage is, when you get lost, simply look up, find the big sign that says Raffles Hospital, and head that way as the hotel is right next door!Next time we have breakfast included, which we havent had before, but it was free so we were not going to turn it down.I will review breakfast when we get back.

<Content>Good value I like this hotel. I've stayed here 3 times already and are going back in just a couple of days. I have always been treated in a friendly and polite way. I don't spend my holidays chatting with the staff - but they are always there if I need tany service.The hotel is very close to Bugis Junction, the shops, metro and restaurants. It's clean, fresh and has been a good value for money.If you're only here for a couple of days - I will strongly recomend it. For a week or perhaps longer - try to find a more secluded and smaller hotel that cares for you as a friend - not a customer.The hotels breakfast buff茅 is the only thing I don't like. But there is a great bakery just a few blocks down close to the hospital.

<Content>Good Hotel, Good Value - Don't know why other reviewers didn't like it ! This review is quite delayed because I stayed here in Aug 2005. I was recently researching hotels on Tripadvisor for my Dec 2006 trip to Singapore and I came across many bad reviews for this hotel which surprised me considering my past stay there.I'm not sure if I have low standards or low expectations compared to other guests in this hotel but I've found the Golden Landmark to be a good hotel and good value for money. The rooms were clean, the sheets are not torn, towels were clean and basic toileteries were provided. The lifts are busy because its a busy hotel but they were clean and all were operational.The reception staff were professional and polite - not friendly or chatty. When we arrived they did their job, flashed the usual smiles and moved on to the next guest. That left us no time to judge their friendliness or indulge in touristy chitchat - but the staff were certainly NOT rude in any manner.Golden Landmark was most certainly good when I stayed there in Aug '05. If you want to experience what bad means then you gotta stay in Aspinals Hotel in Little India - I did that in Dec '06 and realized how good Golden Landmark was.For Indians this hotel has a surprise - it has an inhouse Indian restaurant which serves buffet and regular Indian food. We used to dine here regularly and the food was always decent.Breaskfast was included in our package and was well laid out with choice of juices, cerealls, fresh fruits, tea and coffee etc.The location of hotel is nice for shopping in Bugis Junction and Bugis village. The Bugis MRT is below the Bugis junction and its a short 5-7 min walk from the hotel.

<Content>A really really bad hotel. Really bad hotel.Terrible front desk staff,rude and indifferent attitude. We checked in much after our scheduled check in time but our room was not ready so had to wait 45 minutes for our room.Room itself was ok.nothing extraordinary,but the window had so many oil stains and hand prints,which gave the room a rather untidy look,Breakfast was a battle with hordes and hordes of budget travellers converging upon the food,of which there was not enough of. Lack of crockery and cutlery and even food forced us to start eating breakfast out.Check out took a really long time...Location not so great,a 15 minute walk to Bugis street junction station,which can be tiring on a long day.If you have a choice,dont stay here.

<Content>Really did not like this hotel What a disappointment! This hotel felt so tired and in dire need of renovation. The bathroom was dark, mouldy and screaming out for a good old scrub. As for being woken up each morning at 6.30 am by the noise coming from what we assumed were the water tanks above the room - jumbo jets landing would have made less noise ! Not a good way to start your day. Would not stay again in this hotel.

<Content>Disguistingly DIRTY !!! Pro: Great locationCons: Disguistingly DIRTY and more...!!!Mouldy bathroom, mouldy shower curtain that reeked of urine, scrapping paintwork... you feel dirty even after a shower!No hot water in the shower, which I had to ring to get fixed.They allow people to smoke in the corridors and without any sort of ventilation makes the corridor stink of corridor smoke which permeated into our room (supposedly a smoke free room which we had to pay extra for!!)Service is very slow. Whenever we ring for service, it takes a long time firstly for someone to pick up the phone, then for someone to see to our request.Location is great at Bugis BUT it is also next to a mosque, which means you hear their daily prayer chants. This is especially annoying for light sleepers when you hear it at dawn.A word of warning for safety.. the lift doors have no sensors and close very quickly. Be wary when pushing a pram through!!To sum, this is NOT a golden experience. Avoid, avoid, AVOID!!!

<Content>Clean and basic We stayed for 2 nights and were really happy with the room. It was clean and tidy. The bed was very comfortable and enough room for 2 adults and a child. We did not have any meals in the hotel and i never saw many other people either.Singapore is fantastic we walked from the hotel to most of the sights but the MRT station is excellent and very safe way to travel.Bugis is right on the door. The staff were friendly and allowed us to check in early.We had a wonderful time.

<Content>Good location, nice hotel This hotel is nicely located close to the Civic District of Singapor, making it easy to get around and see the sites. Just kittycorrner to the hotel is a spectacular mosque and excellent food. The hotel was nice and front desk was pleasant, although not terribly helpful. The concierges, however, were fantastic! They were very helpful with how to get around, where to go walking, etc. They made the stay excellent. The rooms were a bit plain, but the airconditioner was in fine working form and that was all that mattered! This hotel did not provide a hairdryer and considering my electrical converters did not work properly, that was a bit of a problem. All in all, I enjoyed my time at this hotel, largely because of the location.

<Content>Simple Hotel in Singapore with the Basics The Golden Landmark Hotel in Singapore is located a block from Exit A of the Singapore SMRT Subway Line, Bugis Station. The hotel itself is located on a small shopping complex that offered little to no stores. The entrance to the hotel is the bell desk and the elevator. The lobby and reception area is on the 3rd floor easily accessible by the escalators at the entrance. The lobby looked like a 70's golden karoake bar. The check-in process was smooth and fast. We checked in early around 11am and was given a room immediately according to our reservation. The room we booked was in the deluxe level, floors 12-15. The rooms seemed small but it had everything we needed. We had a view of Arab Street and some residential streets. The bathroom was not all that pleasing. The bathroom had a serious case of mildew. Our room had individually controlled A/C. The hotel offered wireless internet at S$25 for 24 hours. I found it easier to by a SingTel phone card from any 7-Eleven or money exchange place to call home than use the internet to write. Toll-Free calls are free-of-charge at this hotel. Breakfast at the hotel is at the restaurant. The buffet style breakfast included the continental fare, hot items including eggs, potatoes, and pancakes. There was also asian dishes as well as indian dishes served. The pool is located on the 5th floor. There is also another restaurant in the hotel serving traditional northern Indian cuisine with lunch buffet priced at around S$16. The hotel was near Bugis Village where you will find where the locals shopped. During the day there are many shops and stalls that offer items you will not find at the famous Orchard Rd. Being so close to the SMRT Subway Line, I believe this hotel is decent for the money paid. The staff members are very helpful and the housekeeping attended to all needs promptly.

<Content>Avoid I've stayed in this hotel on my way from Europe to Japan. I booked 3 nights because I arrived at 5 AM and left 10 PM next day. Stayed practically 36 hours. I made a longer stop over.Why I book it ? Lured by the room's rate and by name: Golden鈥?br/>Why I post it so late ? I will travel again on the same route and I am looking for a deal鈥nd I remembered the bad surprise I had when I checked in this hotel. I hope other will not fall for it.The only refurbished part of this hotel is the lobby. The room was telling the age ( 20 years) and was exceptional dirty. The dirt was shining. Fingerprints, oily palm prints ! all over the window, hear in the bed, dirty carpets and smelly in general.I tipped the maid ( a young man) with 5 $ to clean a bit. The result: disappointing. I complained to the front desk. no result.The restaurant offers discounts to people accommodated in the hotel; do not forget to ask for.Position of the hotel is excellent. Easy access to everything. The City program for stop over travelers is amazing. If you have kids is a must. Very well organized. Visit what you can in the short time, is great. They offer discounts with the coupons for the trips, but the guide and the limousine bus are so expensive that you lose all the leverage.The bus and taxi are a good choice for trips; the island is small and you do not really need a guide. My opinion, don't go for less than 100 US$ room rate for hotels in Singapore. They have a different view of comfort and money value than other countries.And this hotel ? Avoid at all cost.

<Content>Handily located.....but little else going for it. Firstly the layout of the hotel is a little weird. You enter at the street level and the counter you see before you is not reception. You have to go up the escalator to reach that. Breakfast was very average. The room was OK but the so called bathroom was pathetic. The location is good, in Arab Street a short walk from Bugis Market one way and Little India the other. MRT (Bugis) is very close. When we returned 3 days later we chose another hotel. We wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>Indian tourist favouite This hotel is located near the little india, there is a large amount of indian tourists. The service is pretty poor, you may be expected to wait 10 min at the receptions. Bad lift, doors close too fast, expect no smiles from the staff, especailly from the bell boys. overall stay only if you are desperate

<Content>Dirty hotel Had the unfortunate experience to stay at this dirty, unfriendly, no service hotel. Despite a 14 hour flight and the hotel knowning our arrival times we still had to wait a further 3 hours to check in our room, which when we did was filthy, despite being allegedly cleaned, toe-nail clippings still left on carpet!!, The staff are rude and not helpful. There are many hotels Singapore for the same price, don't stay unless desperate

<Content>Gold now tarnished! Having always booked this hotel over several decades for my Singapore stopovers I am sorry to report that this year's four Singapore stopovers are my last at the Golden Landmark. Their Reception Service has become tardy, even bordering on indifference. At each check-in of my pre-paid pre-booked stopover after long haul flights I have been kept waiting in the lobby (only 4 seats there) for well over an hour and on two occasions over two hours before a room became reluctantly available. The breakfasts in the hotel lobby restaurant are not at all appetising. The bathrooms are showing a certain fatigue and signs of shoddy maintenance. And trying to actually get into one of the lifts is an exercise in patience as the doors now close so quickly it is almost impossible to make a dash into the waiting lift - the starlight indicators seem to be out of synch!All very disappointing as this hotel is ideally located in exotic Arab Street with its great range of batiks and silks, and only a five minute stroll to the fascinating shopping area near the mosque where I have purchased the very best in Vietnamese lacquerware. And just around the corner is the new and amazing art deco Park View office building, not to mention a short walk to modernised Bugis Junction and its handy Cold Storage. Golden Landmark has the convenience of being the first drop-off or last pick-up by the airport stopover-shuttle bus but there is nowhere to sit while waiting except on the small carpeted section of staircase beside the escalators and amongst the stacks of suitcases and bags.The bell porters at the actual street level entrance are still reliable, always good-humoured and remind me of more golden days.
