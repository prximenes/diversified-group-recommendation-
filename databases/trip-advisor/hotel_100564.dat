<Content>Best Deal in Town I never write reviews but feel compelled to do so this time. I am staying at this hotel currently and have several times in the past. It is the only hotel in the center of the city under $100, nearly impossible to find in Seattle. It is a block from the Westlake Center and a few blocks from Pike Place Market, really an ideal location. No-frills hotel but the rooms are always clean, comfortable, and well-insulated w/ basic amenities including in-room coffee. The housekeeping staff is great and the front desk personnel are always extremely kind and helpful. There is a nice restaurant downstairs and a laundry and fitness room onsite as well. I highly recommend this place and will return again and again!

<Content>Best hotel you can get for the price We shopped around a little and then walked in to this nice clean hotel. The king size room is very specious, and the hotel has a great location close to Belltown and a few great restaurants (Especially Lola). We loved it.

<Content>Not too shabby!! After reading the not-so-great reviews about this place, my husband and I decided to give it a try. The staff was friendly upon arrival and the room was very clean. It costs $15 for 24hr parking but it is well worth it as it is impossible to find long term parking in the city! The location was close to everything and didn't have any problems during our stay. My husband and I would stay here agian!

<Content>I understand now.... After reading reviews online, I decided to stay at the Sixth Ave Inn. After talking with the staff, I realized something I didn't see online. They were in the middle of a transition of management and that they were instantly working on updating the hotel. I came in to the city to stay because my house was being remodeled. The entire stay was enjoyable; the staff at the front desk, to the restaurant, to walking in the halls with the housekeepers, every person I came in contact with was friendly and eager to help me! I was shocked after reading some reviews on here.I got the hint to ask for an odd number room as those face the front street on 6th, a quieter side I was told. Ask for that side when you go!I saw they are going through some growing pains, but am sure those will iron out in time. Contrary to reviews I saw on here, they transfered calls to my room, the wireless internet was free and was available in the lobby (I was told they were getting it in the rooms soon), and the price was reasonable.I think in a couple of years it will be a totally different hotel.I would recommend this place to anyone, and would definetly stay here again.

<Content>lemon 1 Since I was going to check out and recheck in 2 days later, I asked Six avenune inn to keep heavey luggage for 2 days because I will come back to check in again but the front desk refuesed. Unbeliable. Othere average hotelalways keep the luggage if recheck in 2 days. Six avenue innis not kindness. I could not go to victoria with easy hand free trip , I had to go to Victoria with carrying heavy luggage.2 My agency tried to fax to me then asked fax nunber but six avenue inn told first disconnet number, then agency called back for unable to fax, then front desk gave 2nd fax always busy line number , therefore Agency was unable to fax again, Six avenue inn doew not let use customer the fax line because six avenune inn exclude to use internet to other customer therefore unable to receive the important fax.3Since unable to fax, My agent tried to call me to the room, but front desk said telephone to the room is not working today then I can imagine to let other customer to use intenet .1-3 Overall,this hotel does not provide fax service , nor telephonecommunication service to the room, It is terrible service not thinking for customers. If emergency happen,to family, howguest know the news.?  I willl not recommend to ohters to use this hotel.

<Content>Affordable But Basic The Sixth Avenue Inn was about what i expected for the price, Clean but fairly basic accomodations. The Inn is a bit shabby and in need of a re-model, but it was clean and convenient to downtown Seattle activites. However, the elevators were not working during my stay and we were disappointed that the entire restaurant was closed due to a reunion being held at the Inn. Unfortunately, I forgot some property in the room when I departed. It took several phone calls over three days to Housekeeping voice mail before I received a return call confirming my property was there. The only live person I could contact was the front desk, and they declined to assist me. I'd only stay here again to avoid the exorbitant prices of downtown Seattle accomodations.

<Content>Decent room for an affordable price in downtown Seattle I went to visit a friend in Seattle in mid-September and see a game at Husky Stadium. I chose this place after looking around on various websites for an affordable hotel room in downtown. This place fit that bill.The room was average--a typical midgrade hotel. Very clean. The only real downside was that the walls did not hold sound out from the outside. I heard a lot of noise from other rooms as well as from outside. Fortunately I slept well.The staff was very nice and was willing to hold my bags for me for a few hours after I checked out.There is a restaurant in the hotel; I ate breakfast there and the food was pretty good.This hotel is about 3 blocks from Westlake Center, which is the terminus of both the S Lake Union streetcar and the monorail to Seattle Center (Space Needle area). It is about six blocks from the Pike Place market (up and down a hill).

<Content>No prizes for Sixth Avenue Inn I was booked in to this hotel as part of a package. I stayed three nights. Everything was a little below my standards. The tub was worn - not dirty, but the enamel was stained. The mattress was soft and bendy - no springs sticking through but not much better. My name was incorrect in the system and I was told they couldn't correct it. I was unable to get my messages and had to have the switchboard put me through to get them. My last night I wanted a drink at 10:40 but the bar was closed already. I made one local call and the charge was outrageous ($2.25). I will avoid this property in the future.

<Content>Great location! We had some trouble with our flight out of SEA and needed to find a hotel quickly. My wife had never been in Seattle before so I wanted to find something downtown with good access to everything.The staff at Sixth Avenue Inn were quite good - the front desk clerk had some trouble programming our room keys properly but was otherwise very helpful and polite.Overall the condition of the hotel was a little lacking. There's allegedly free wireless in the lobby and lounge, but I wasn't able to ever connect successfully. Our room was equipped with a wired internet connection that consisted of a few different boxes stacked on the side table of the bed, none of which were powered up or connected to anything so obviously did not work. The room was clean but worn - the carpet needs to be replaced and the bathroom was due for an overhaul but I've definitely stayed in worse places. Keep an eye on the elevators too - they worked ok but acted a little weird. They'd occasionally forget to open the door when they got to a floor until you manually hit the door open button. Kind of scary when it happens the first time but you get used to it.We had breakfast at the hotel - the food was great as was the service. The lounge looked quite nice too. I'd definitely eat there again.You can walk to a lot of great areas in Seattle very quickly from the hotel. We walked up to the fish market and had dinner nearby at a nice pub. It's also within the free downtown transit area so you can explore to your heart's content.I'd stay with Sixth Avenue Inn again if I got a good rate. We got a decent price for downtown at the time but I wouldn't stay at their full rate.

<Content>Don't miss it! Motel 6 quality at Marriott Prices This place was dingy and ugly. The front desk staff was not friendly. The room was stark. There was not one picture on the walls. The bathroom was tiny and the bathtub clean but stained and in need of caulking. The clock radio was broken and there was a lot of noise from the street. The room smelled. I couldn't wait to get out of there.

<Content>very happy with sixth avenue inn We booked our vacation through a travel agent in Redding,California through Clipper vactions.Because of the negative reviews on this website we asked the travel agent to book us in at the Paramount Hotel after our return from the San Juan Islands. When we arrived in Seattle on Amtrak at 9:00 pm we were pleasantly surprised at the very large and CLEAN rooms. Had we known it would be this nice we would have stayed the whole time we were in Seattle as it was every bit as nice as the Paramount. The staff was excellent (except for Andy who could use a little attitude adjustment) and we were very pleased with our stay and with the restaurant Thank you for a very pleasant stay. We would highly recommend your hotel to our friends going to Seattle.

<Content>Buyer beware! I was booked into this property via Clipper Vacations. It was on their list of budget motels close to the pier and downtown. I had read TripAdvisor reviews, but not knowing Seattle and on a limited budget, I agreed to the booking. I am sorry I did.I was traveling with my tween daughter and reserved a double double. The elevator was cramped with worn carpet on the floor and walls. Upon entering the room, we both noticed an odd odor. The carpet was worn and had stains. The bedspreads had stains. The beds were somewhat comfortable, but lumpy. The fan was so squeaky, I had to turn it off by unplugging it from the wall. There were no polarized plugs in in the room. The TV was plugged in with an adapter and on a extended outlet addition. The paint was worn and chipped in several areas. The bathroom had chips in the paint over the tile and the shower/tub wall had peeling paint.To top it off, all double double rooms overlook a 7th Avenue business called Little Darlings an intimate gentleman's club. When I asked to be changed to another room, the staff informed me that the best they could do was to put me in a queen room with a roll away. They did give me free parking ($14 - $12 plus tax) for two of the nights I was there.The staff was friendly and helpful. There is a decent selection of TV channels. There is a blow dryer available in the bathroom as well as an ironing board and iron. It is within a few blocks of Westlake Center, the monorail and downtown shopping.Overall, however, I will not stay in this motel again nor recommend it to anyone. I did contact Clipper Vacations to let them know about the problems with this property they recommended.

<Content>great value and location central to downtown June 2nd 2008 stayed here before leaving town from a week plus vacation in the area and a cruise.The location and price were a good value.Had a lovely large room on the 5th floor. Check in and out was flawless. Booked online and prepaid. Close to Westin for the airport shuttle and this worked out wonderfully. wish we had known how close this was to the Space Needle--within walking distance. It is close enough to all the sights.It is also directly across the street from the Jazz Alley for shows.Perfect location and price value for Seattle.Definitly on the short list for future stays in town.

<Content>Make sure you read notes before you eat/drink or they will charge you a fortune! Possibly one of the worst ever. Lots of hidden fees - e.g. they will charge you for parking your car at the hotel during your stay. Smelly rooms, horrible beds with lots of lumps in the mattress. I am suspecting the carpet was clean but it looks so worn out that I didn't feel safe walking on it without my shoes on. Very old everyting. Doubt this place ever had any updates done. Overall makes you wonder whether you will bring any pests in your lugage home after this stay. What really pissed me off is the way the hotel has placed two bottles of water in the guest room and had a hidden note behind the bottles saying that you're free to drink the water, but it will cost you $3 (!) per 750 ml bottle! Oh, should I also say $3 per tiny cup of undrinkable liquid which was supposed to be coffee!Yes, the quoted hotel price is reasonable . However, it stopps beging reasonable after you see what it is you are paying for and even more so when they add in all the fees and charges and hand you the bill. With all the extra fees I could have stayed in the Holiday Inn!

<Content>Great location but laughable rooms We booked our flights to Seattle as a package and got a great deal! $660 for two people, three nights, and airfare, but we didn't have a choice as to where we were to stay. The hotel itself if old and kind of stinky. I refused to go in the elevator because it was a bit decrepit and smelled of vomit, and the stairways smelled like pee, but the room itself was quite clean, though very bare. We walked all over the city many times over, as the location of the hotel is superb. You're in Belltown so there are tons of cute places to eat or drink, and you're right next to downtown with a plethora of chain clothing stores. I don't know that I'd stay there again, but it was certainly sufficient for our low budget, last minute, long weekend trip.

<Content>great cozy hoitel The location is great; right behind the Westin  next to a McDonalds, within walking distance to downtown  the monorail. The outside it looks like an older small Motel, but inside it's as good as any mid-level (think Holiday Inn). It has a resturant that's a bit pricy, but the food is good quality and the atmosphere's great with it's wood burning fireplace. Nice place to be during a gray day in Seattle.I booked through my airline so I could get milage points, but I would highly reccommend it to anyone.

<Content>Not Bad for the Price A great bargain for Downtown Seattle.It's old, but clean and a little noisy. The location is great. Staff is friendlly. We were able to leave our car in the parking lot for hours after we checked out, which was a real nice bonus. If you just need a place to sleep for the night at a bargain price, this is it. If you want more amenities, go elsewhere. We will stay there again.

<Content>Give it a big miss For those thinking of staying at this hotel due to its price and location tot he city - think again. I booked this hotel for the above reasons and now regret that decision. You would be better off paying a few more dollars and staying somewhere decent or staying a little further out of the city - everything is close so walking is not much of a problem. Rooms are small, beds are like sleeping on a cement base and the smell!!!! When i arrived in my room I found hairs in the bed and somones dirty old sock on the second shelf of the bedside table - and it was not my sock!! Dirty in other words. The cleaning of the rooms is brief and not through by my view. The light from the hall way/walkway outside the room shines under the gap from the the door keeping you awake, and if that was not enough the noise from the traffic would wake you anyways once you did finally get to sleep. I had 5 nights booked and ended up checking out of the hotel and cutting my trip short from australia just so i didnt have to stay any longer in the hotel.If you are looking for a room like that described above, have a grat stay, I however would never stay there again. This is the first time I have had written a review on here, even though I have travelled alot...I just hope it saves at least one other person the dissatisfaction of booking a room here, only to be disappointed.

<Content>Great location, not the most beautiful room We stayed here for the price and location. The room was very outdated but we only slept there. We had the great fortune of looking out at the adult store from our window but that didn't bother us. We were only a short walk away from the shopping center and city tram which we took to the Space Needle even though we could have walked there. Once at the shopping center, we took a carriage ride which was cool. We were within walking distance to Pike Market and restaurants and bars. We would stay here again!

<Content>Was a real dump The room price was OK for Seattle. It was the first hotel that I ever stayed that had NO pictuers hanging in the rooms or in the halls. There was a draft under the door as it was an inch off the floor  was very noisy when in the room, poor water pressure  the fellow at the front desk was not very courteous upon check-in.. My thought is that this is a place to hang your hat  not to expect very much more..

<Content>Find another place A group of us were in Seattle for a conference, and were booked into the Sixth Avenue Inn. I was concerned after I'd read reviews before going there - as it turned out, rightfully so. My room - a queen - was dingy and smelly. I couldn't identify the odor, but it may have been a combination of a former smoking room and, well, I don't know what. The place was also not designed for a business traveler. My laptop computer uses a 3-prong plug. My room had only one 3-prong outlet, nowhere convenient to where I needed to use my computer. Incredibly, the coffee maker, also with a 3-prong outlet, used a hardware store 3-to-2-prong adapter. I strongly suspect that's a violation of every fire code in the US, especially for commercial buildings.While they claim to have internet access, in my room there was no wireless, and the wired version cable was so short it did not reach to either the bed or the table. I never did figure out where one could use it. They've not figured out to put a water proof shower curtain liner inside the shower curtain - instead, they use 2 fabric shower curtains, so if one puts one on the outside and the other on the inside of the tub, after the shower, one was left with a flood in the bathroom. When I was gone during the day and the room was made up, half-filled styrofoam coffee cups and dirty water glasses were left where they were. I don't recall having every stayed in a hotel where I didn't want my feet to touch any floor surface, or my body to touch the bedspread or blanket. It was just grungy. The only upsides: location is good, and staff was very friendly.

<Content>Value for money in great location We had booked before checking TripAdvisor and were worried after reading some of the very negative reviews but were pleasantly surprised when we got there. All staff we met were friendly and helpful, our room was clean, so were the beds and bathroom. There were four of us in the room and there was enough space for our 3-night stay. We had sufficient coffee, tea, iron, hairdryer, towels, soaps, etc. The beds were very soft. It's so close to the major shops (Nordstrom, Macy's, Pacific Place) that one could shop, drop it all off back at the hotel and go back again for more. Good restaurants nearby. The breakfast in the hotel wasn't too bad either and again very friendly staff. I would definitely stay here again and spend my money on food and clothing/cosmetics rather than on a more expensive hotel room.

<Content>Stay Here for a Great Price My fiance and I stayed here for four nights after booking through Priceline. We found the hotel to be in a perfect area to walk to everything!! Pike's Place is only a few blocks away. It is close to all shopping districts and was very affordable. The staff was super friendly and accomodated our requests. If you are in Seattle to do sightseeing and want to save on those expensive hotel fees, stay here. It's affordable and gets you what you need

<Content>Decent I stayed at the Sixth Avenue last night. The checkout clerk was very friendly with a great smile. Location turned out to be very good--I could walk to make the meetings I had, no problem. They charge $10 for parking, which I wasn't expecting (I'd called and they said they had parking, but didn't indicate at an additional fee). The bed was hard, not particularly comfortable. I couldn't get the Wi-Fi to work, though didn't ask for help--but this was frustrating. Checkout was effortless. Overall, I found the room imminently forgettable, but adequate for the purpose.

<Content>Walk to Pike Place Market for breakfast As a Seattle native, I was pleased to bid and win Sixth Avenue Inn onPriceline. The motel is just that, a motel, right in the middle of Downtown Seattle. I think I remember it from the Seattle World's Fairin 1962! It's a bit dated and our bathroom didn't have any shelf space, but IMO, you can overlook that type of thing because of the amazing safe location. You'll think you've returned to the 60's when you drive up (easy access to I-5, which is also very important), but the location is unbeatable --- and no long waits for elevators or walks through endless lobbies). Poof and you're out the door on your way to Pike Place Market, Belltown, Downtown, monorail. Pro football and baseball venues are a 15 min bus ride south. If exploring Downtown Seattle is your goal, and you want to PLAY with your dollarsinstead of paying for a high rise with a view, try this motel.

<Content>Great value for the price. I don't understand many of the negative reviews here. We stayed one night here mid-September. The location was great - walking distance to Pike Place, across the street from the Westin. Front desk staff was very accommodating. The in-house restaurant had a great breakfast -friendly staff, lots of food,  it was tasty too. The room was okay - clean, basic, no complaints. It wasn't fancy, but it was sufficient. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>The Worst Hotel I have ever stayed. The room i got at the 6th Ave inn was deplorable. There was a heavy stench in the room. The vents probably were not cleaned in few years. They had half an inch dust accumulated. The walls were peeling, water stains on the celing. The room was a one stop above a barn in a farm. The bathroom was disgusting. I was emberrassed on behalf of this corporation, who owns the sheraton hotels world wide. One would think they should know what hospitality business is about.Had a sleepless nights during my stay. I could not sleep on their matress. They were very soft. That is $140 during the week and $165 per night on the weekends. I t was the biggest rip off I have ever seen in my life. I also fell in the bathroom and almost broke my neck. The bathroom floors were full of stains. Moved out after my fall and went to an another hotel. Please avoid this property.

<Content>The hotel is okay The hotel is located just outside of the downtown area but a block or two from the monorail. It is appropriately rated a 2-star hotel. I stayed at the hotel for two nights because I was attending a conference at the convention center. Checking in and checking out was speedy and pleasant. The hotel room was okay, it was a nice size, clean (although I did find a hair on one of the towels). If you need an inexpensive place to stay with basic amenities, this place is fine.

<Content>Stinky and dirty, but otherwise great I stayed here with my two sons (9 and 10) while we took in a couple of Mariners' games. We are by no means stuck up people who expect 5 star hotels at a budget price. What we did expect was simple, clean accommodations. We got simple, but we didn't get clean. The room had a very strong bad smell, was dirty and the carpet all around the bathroom was wet. My kids even thought it was gross and asked if they could keep their shoes on in the room - pretty bad when boys think it's dirty.On the bright side, it was less than $10 by cab to Safeco Field.Needless to say, I would not recommend this place.

<Content>worthwhile Great value, kind staff, outstanding location. Paid about $95/night 3 weekdays. Showtime, bottled water, hair dryer provided. 10 minute walk north to the Needle (and the recommended Hendrix museum). It's close enough to walk to the Monorail and is just inside the free bus zone (daytime only) to the central downtown - just walk up to 5th and step right on.I felt safe and comfortable though walking north on Sixth the area is somewhat deserted; but I saw none of the harassing riffraff that I found on some of the Waterfront. Coming in at midnight was fine.Take the hundreds of dollars you saved passing up the frills of the Westin next door and go one block to the Palace Kitchen Restaurant (entrees $15-$25) - easily 3 star quality. Have them recommend a local beer too. There's also a serious jazz club on the same block.For a clean, safe, comfortable room with the essentials well covered, more character than a Holiday Inn, and terrific location I found this to be a shrewd investment for a business/pleasure trip.

<Content>A semi-dump in downtown Seattle 1. I've been to Seattle numerous times; used to live there actually. 2. I'm not a highbrow traveler. 3. With that being said, since I did want to save a few bucks on my most recent trip to Seattle, I decided to check out the 6th Ave Inn. I've seen this place numerous times and it looked ok from the outside and was in an ok location (not the best, but not the worst). 4. My overall impression?  * Yes, it is cheaper than the better hotels-- for example the  Westin, which is one block away, BUT, if you just hate  staying at the place, what's the point?  * The rooms-- old. They're clean, but old... and small.  * The overall hotel is, old.  * The overall hotel and my nonsmoking room just smelled...  a mixture of smoke and various bodily odors that  apparently mixed into the establishment over the years.  * The bed / mattress-- old and soft.  * The bottomline-- Motel 6 is a better quality motel / rooms at a cheaper price. The problem is, there are no Motel 6s in the downtown area. It's one of the dilemmas, if you  want to be in a decent location and want a nice room, you'll have to pay the extra 100.0-150.00 / night. Via this  most recent trip, I realized that it's worth it to spend the  extra money so that I can actually enjoy the trip... OR  perhaps get one of the nice suite type rooms around  Lake Union (but again-- you'll be away from the downtown area).

<Content>Do NOT book, false information My family and I just finished a 7-day Alaskan Cruise. We were looking for a hotel in Seattle, WA that had a shuttle service from the Pier to the Hotel, from the Hotel to the Airport, and a place to leave our luggage for 5-6 hrs as we went around site seeing in downtown. The booking company for this particular hotel assured me that all of my criteria's were met with this hotel and I booked the room (just to store our luggage) for $115. It ended up there were no travel accomodations to the hotel or to the airport. We ended up having to take 2 taxis to each of the destinations. Needless to say, I was very angry and it was an extra $80 over the hotel bill! The hotel manager was not around or ever available via phone. The customer service reps finally got back to me after I called 5-6 times and sent an email from their website. The matter was resolved, hopefully. They said they would reimburse me for the taxi fares, but I'll believe it when I see it. My advice for anyone in the same situation is to grab a taxi to the airport ($30 flat fee from anywhere downtown to the SEATAC airport), check in your luggage early, and take the ride-on bus back to downtown ($1.50 each way, .25 for seniors, free kids). It's free to ride on the bus in downtown Seattle until 7pm everyday.

<Content>Great Location We've stayed at this property a few times now. We like the hotel for it's location. The hotel is walking distance to pike Market and al the shopping in Seattle.The hotel has parking which you have to pay a small fee for and the nightly rate we payed was 99$. The rooms are clean and they have good beds. We've never experienced any problems in our stays.

<Content>Beyond Budget Booked this hotel for a weekend in November upon recommendation as clean, Spartan room from a travel book, so we were not expecting much... I was seriously under whelmed. The room was old, tired and felt very dirty. I slept fully clothed and wore socks at all times. The shower was gross, but sink and toilet seemed new and clean. Pillows felt filled with cotton balls, bed creaked and squeaked with the slightest movement (as did everyone else's around us too), walls and carpet were stained, did not feel the lock on the door would work. We faced a lovely strip club. The noise outside the hotel was expected due to the downtown location, but the noise from inside the hotel was obscene! People banging on our door at 3 in the morning, a party in the room above us (not to mention the 'lovemaking' we felt as if we were right in the bed with them!) Walls in general were paper thin could hear all of our neighbours conversations and whatever show they were watching on TV.Some of the staff was very friendly, others not the sharpest... The location was great and we could walk everywhere. Would not reccomend and am embarresed to say I stayed here!

<Content>totally fine Our admin booked this hotel for me for a conference because my manager said to get something inexpensive for me (while he stayed in a nice hotel, of course). I was worried because of the negative reviews here, but the Sixth Avenue Inn turned out to be totally fine.It's not the fanciest place in the world, I agree, and the exterior seems not to have changed since about 1970, but everything was clean and functional, and the location was great. The staff was nice enough, and the other people staying there were normal and nice, too. There was a little noise from the street and from upstairs, but it was easy to ignore and didn't keep me up. Other than that, I was pleased with my stay there and would consider staying there again if I had to be downtown for work.

<Content>Worst hotel I've ever stayed at... I travel with family a lot and stay in a lot of DISCOUNT hotels. I know what I can get for the money and I have stayed in some pretty basic places before. But the stay at this hotel was so unsatifactory that we left early. We got to the hotel before check-in time. So we explained who we were and left our bags. When we arrived in the evening, there were hardly any rooms left and the 2-bed room that we reserved was gone (I don't know how this was possible since we pre-checked in before anyone else even got there). The front desk service was completely unbending in their uncourteous and non-helpful nature. THE ROOM: I was pregnant and my husband and I had to share one bed with our toddler. The brass bed was so unstable that we were rolling off the edges and it creaked, rattled and shook all night long. No roll-away was provided and my husband ended up having to sit in a small wooden chair for part of the night to sleep in. I got a total of 3 hours sleep because of it. The bathroom had disgusting unsanitary remains of the last people to stay there (smears along the sink and tile). The toilet was shotty. The carpet was scary to have a young child walk, sit or play on. WE got up early that morning and checked out 2 days early. Luckily the manager allowed us to get a refunded amount for the two nights we would not be there but was in no way wanting to make up for the night that we did stay there. We went out of the city center to stay in tukwila and had a great time the rest of the trip. Overall, it made my husband's first trip to Seattle a bit tainted with the memory of that place and I was very disappointed.

<Content>Great value for downtown location hotel This was our first visit to Seattle. We wanted a decent hotel in a great location downtown. We found it in The Sixth Avenue Inn! The building is older, but we enjoyed our small room with newly remodeled bathroom. The bathroom fan didn't work when we arrived, but we voiced our request to have it fixed and it was within the day while we were out sightseeing. Housekeeping was wonderful--very helpful, quiet, and willing to go the extra mile. The front desk staff was also great to chat with and help direct us toward what we wanted to see/do. The streets are busy with trucks and buses, which did highlight the single paned windows, but it's just that....a busy downtown area! We loved the location to the many shops and places to eat. There is such a variety of both within blocks so we were very pleased. The restaurant within was charming. Most of the wait staff were pleasant and prompt. The value and quantity of food for the cost is within reason--breakfasts were huge! We would stay here again---we booked this hotel on Hotwire and received a rate much lower than usual. And we would recommend this hotel to other budget-wise travelers! Thanks for a great stay Sixth Avenue!

<Content>Horrible Experience at the Sixth Ave Inn Well, let me start with the online pictures do not represent the interior of the hotel! The carpets were stained in the halls and rooms, our room had nails sticking out of the closet and my girl friend cut her self on it, we informed the desk and they said oh. The bathroom door had fecal matter on it, the tub was dirty and had soap scum growing on it. There was construction going on out side and every car that went over those steel plates making a horrible boom sounded like it was right in our room. The walls are non-existent, you hear everyone and everything imaginable. Oh yeah, for breakfast we paid nearly 30 bucks for 3 bowls of cereal and toast, nothing else. We will NEVER RETURN again! It was extremely frustrating that we informed the front desk of our problems and they still had not a care in the world about them. NOT AS ADVERTISED - if it was remodeled in 02, must have been 1902!

<Content>Some great folks, all else very poor. Our group was booked into the 6th Ave Inn by another hotel that had overbooked. The folks on the desk were wonderful -- helped us into non-smoking rooms when all were full, no hassels at all with the transfered booking.My first night I awoke to water pouring through the ceiling in my bathroom. The night clerk wasn't alarmed -- apparently this happens when another guest showers on a floor above. My complaints the next day were waved off until I insisted on a maintenance person coming up to inspect the staining and bubbling of paint in my bathroom.Bedding was poor -- the sheets on my queen-sized bed were for a twin? In any case, the sheets could not be tucked in top and bottom.If you stay, insist on a room on the east end of the hotel (numbers under about x20.) Those on the west end had NO HOT WATER.

<Content>Sixth Ave a good budget choice for downtown We really enjoyed our stay at Sixth Ave inn. Our room appeared to be newly renovated and was spacious and modern. Hotel is in a good location for exploring Seattle..we walked to Pikes Place market in about 10 minutes and downtown stores are even closer. The hotel restaurant is a gem..great food at good prices in a nicer atmosphere than you might have expected. Hotel has parking at a charge of $10 per night ,which is good for a downtown hotel. I would definately stay here again if in Seattle.

<Content>Decent hotel This is my second time at the Sixth Avenue Inn, and whilst it is not a ritzy, glam hotel, it has what you need and that is a clean, comfy room. The staff at the hotel are excellent, very polite, friendly and helpful. The location is great, the restaurant has good food and my room was always cleaned well every day.One downside is that the rooms don't have double glazed windows, so you can hear the noise of the traffic.

<Content>Inn's Time Has Passed We booked at the Inn because of a reveiw that claimed it was charming. Charming and Rustic can swiftly give way to Dump without great vigilance. The Inn is headed that way despite some renovations. Room stank until we ran air conditioning for six hours. Bar/restaurant excellent. Staff great. Will not return.

<Content>Perfectly adequate We stayed six nights at the Sixth Avenue Inn. It was a nice, central location for the price we paid. We got a slightly better rate via Expedia than was available booking direct via their web site. We had a room with one queen bed on the 4th floor, on the side of the hotel not facing the adult bookstore. It looked like perhaps those on that side were all doubles? The neighborhood seemed safe, and was within easy walking distance to many restaurants, shops, etc.Hotel furnishings were not new by any means, definitely showing signs of wear, but no real complaints in that department. We could hear a bit of street and hall noise at times, but never enough to keep us awake at night. It was always much quieter when we had the curtains closed. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful, both at the desk and in the restaurant. Restaurant menu was limited overall, but had a good selection of reasonably priced items for breakfast. The room service menu (which we never utilitized) featured a handful of the same restaurant items at an average of $2 additional per item.Our room was clean, and housekeeping staff did a good job throughout the week. They give you the option of new sheets/towels each day. We went to Seattle to experience the city, not to lounge in our room. Overall, this hotel was exactly what we needed and we'd recommend it to friends and stay here again.

<Content>Victoria Clipper Package We booked this room as part of the Victoria Clipper Ferry Package. I had 2 nights at Victoria Marriott Inner Harbor booked, then decided we would return too late for the boarding of our cruise leaving on Saturday. We changed our plans and came to Seattle on the late ferry the night before. We were offered this hotel to substitute, with not many other choices for the same price. This no way campares to the Marriott , but we made the best of it. Rooms were dingy and bathrooms old and dated but clean , we managed. Good Location and breakfast the next morning helped. I would not choose to stay here again, it was not horrible. Friendly staff also.

<Content>Watch for bait-and-switch room rates! The rooms were acceptable. Having a restaurant and bar attached to the hotel was helpful. When we booked the rooms through hotels[--], thankfully we printed out the email confirmations showing all of the rates.Since initially there were no doubles available, i reserved a single queen with a rollaway bed, in order for my two sisters to share a room. When we arrived, a room with two queen beds was found, and i cancelled the rollaway.When we checked out, management's version of our rates were at least $30 higher PER NIGHT PER ROOM. i certainly understand that, in these days of multiple coupons, memberships, and discounts, misunderstanding may occur. What i take issue with is that, even with the email printout, it took several minutes to convince a fairly hostile front desk to adjust the final bill.After we returned home, i checked my visa bill and, in addition to the room charges, there was a single $34 charge. turns out that was for the never-seen, never-used rollaway. after having a lengthy discussion in a long-distance phone call i called visa and disputed the charge.ok hotel, bad management.

<Content>Way LAME for PRICE paid I would never stay here again for the price paid, $120 plus tax. Apparentely prices were jacked up for a parade downtown, since all other weekends seem to be around $89. The place is OLD. It smells like cigarettes. We requested a non-smoking room, we ended up with a smoking room with no way to change it. There was no hair dryer and we called down for one, the guy said he'd 'try' to find us one. We ended up having to call back when no one showed up with it after 30 minutes, he thought we needed it for morning. Bad customer service. The place is just really old and disappointing for that amount of money. I truly felt the need to wash my hands after touching anything in the room. It needs a gutting and remodel BAD. I really don't feel the 2 star rating was correct for this establishment.=

<Content>Not Bad! I was a little wary about the hotel after reading some of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. My son and I stayed for two nights and had no problems at all. On the plus side, we were allowed to check in early into our rooms (at 11:30 a.m.) for no extra charge. That made a big difference. I enjoyed doing a load of laundry after camping for eight straight nights. The washer and dryer were clean and in good working condition. The staff was extremely polite and friendly. They reserved a Town Car for us the morning we left and it was only $30.00 to get to the airport. The driver was there early and it was much nicer than taking a cab. The hotel is conveniently located. We walked to the Space Needle, Pike's Market and Pioneer Square. Our room was 330 square feet, so I was puzzled about some of the complaints about the rooms being small. Our room was only $129.00 in the heart of the summer, which I didn't think was too bad. On the negative side, we did have a view of an adult entertainment store. The rooms are a little worn and shabby--not dirty but not at all elegant. But when I realized that we would be out of the room almost all day and that the Westin was almost twice what we were paying, we decided to spend our extra money on the dining room at the Edgewater Inn on the waterfront. We ate outside and had a fabulous view of the Sound. Anyway, I felt the room was of reasonable quality for the money and the staff was a lot friendlier than at the more expensive hotel we stayed at in San Francisco! One other tip: take the Ducks Tour...it was a lot of fun and you get a good overview of the city.

<Content>Good stay! My husband and I enjoyed our stay here. It is not a fancy hotel, but we spent so much time exploring Seattle, it didn't matter. Yes, there is an adult book store across the street, but I say-loosen up! It is in a great location and the staff were very friendly and helpful. If you can get this hotel at a rate under $100, take it!!

<Content>Not Our Style I agree with earlier assessments that the Sixth Avenue Inn is an okay place for a budget traveler or students who aren't seeking anything special. The hotel and rooms have an overall worn feel. Our biggest issues were with cigarette smoke and a rock-hard bed. After the first night of poor rest, we were on the phone to other hotels to find another place to stay.

<Content>Nice low-mid range hotel, but i received a poor value I first wanted to comment on another review given for this hotel. The parking is not free. There is a $10 dollar charge per night if you want to park in their lot. Another comment relating to other reviews given here: if you can get this place for as low as $66 or $80 a night it is well worth it. We ended up paying $180 since it was short notice stay on a weekend and didn't have an easy time finding a hotel with vacancy. The hotel itself is nice for a low to mid range hotel. The staff is helpful and courteous. They even accomidated a middle of the night request for silverware brought to our room. The rooms were quite clean and the furnishings were in good condition and of moderate quality. They have a fitness room, offered to guests free of charge, which i took advantage of. This room had 3 different machines (bike, eliptical, and treadmill). I'm not much for bikes but tried the elliptical and the treadmill. the elliptical didn't seem to work quite right but the treadmill was adequate. All the equipment seemed a bit dated, likely from the 90's. The treadmill was in good solid working condition although I can't state the condition of the other two. I'm not sure if the fact that I am in great need for a new matress in my own bed at home or if the bed i slept in at this hotel were as exceptional as it seemed. I slept like a baby though. This is saying something too because the walls in this hotel were thin and the windows were alluminum. You could hear police sirens at all hours of the day and night. This didn't bother me so much but if you are looking for a bit more luxury try another hotel. The food at the restraunt was delicious. We ate in the lounge and the ambience and atmosphere was very cozy. Really if it weren't for the high cost of the room i would be completely satisfied. I would stay here again if I recieved a better value. It's literally a block away from westlake mall and many other local attractions.

<Content>Not recommendable I stayed for a whole week at that hotel for a conference. The room was not very pleasant. but worst was that during my absence things got stolen from my room. the room maid let someone in while she was cleaning the room. The hotel personal was very impolite and unfriendly when handling the situation and finally did not compensate me.definitely not recommendable.

<Content>good location Sixth Avenue had just about everything we were looking for in a hotel. Good location, clean comfortable rooms, and price well within our budget. The restaurant/ bar staff were friendly and made it good place to recap the day. It is located so that can you walk to space needle area and you are a block away from free ride bus zone of downtown. Grab the bus and you are at pioneer square or the Public Market in ten minutes. Nordstrom's is only two blocks away. A great place for breakfast or a couple of beers at 9 in the morning or 11 at night is the 5 Point Cafe.

<Content>Affordable and great location for the price My boyfriend and I stayed 2 nights here for a weekend getaway to Seattle and for $80US a night, it was everything we needed. The staff was friendly and the room was clean. It was great for a budget hotel and we felt safe there. There is parking at the hotel for $8/day. We barely spent time in our room as we choose this hotel for its convenient location to all the things we wanted to see. It was walking distance to McDonalds, Starbucks, shopping centres and short driving distances to the Space Needle and EMP. The only thing I didn't like were the uncomfortably flat pillows on the bed. Since we got a corner suite, it was cold when we first went in and had to play around with the heating system to get warmed up. That aside, it was great for the value! 2 recommendations: For anyone who loves bubble tea, you must try Gossip Bubbletea in Chinatown. We've had tons of bubble tea here in Vancouver but Gossip is one of the best we've had. We have to thank previous posters on this board for that tip!For vegetarian lovers, you must try Araya (Thai vegetarian cuisine). Great price, nice atmosphere, generous portions.

<Content>Great Stay I recently stayed at this hotel and really enjoyed it. The room was very clean and the staff were friendly especially in the restaurant. It is a few blocks from the main shopping/business area. If you are coming from the Airport save yourself the cab fare and get the 194 bus for a $1.25. This stops about 100 yards from the hotel

<Content>Basic Hotel For Basic Needs This hotel is perfect for young travellers who just need a place to sleep, and who have no needs far beyond that.The rooms are basic but clean, the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are clean with hot water but very small showers, and the front desk staff is friendly and helpful, but do not go above and beyond. Essentially, this is a two star hotel, fair and square.Bring earplugs, as the walls are paper thin, and there is constant noise either from the street or from other rooms. Even just the people in the room above you moving around is enough to keep you awake at night, since it creates a loud creaking and thumping sound with every step they take.The area is so-so. It is within walking distance to main areas and attractions, and cab rides are short and cheap from this central location, but I wouldn't want to be walking in the immediate area surrounding the hotel.The best feature of this hotel is the restaurant. The staff is amazingly friendly, attentive and FAST! Service is top notch. The food is also great for what it is. Don't expect gourmet cusine, by why would you at a hotel of this callibre. It's homestyle American food, and it is good, with oversized portions (perfect for sharing!).I would stay at this hotel again, but I would bring earplugs.

<Content>Never Again Be sure to verify reservations before arrival, fortunately we did. Even though we made ours on their website and were given a confirmation number, they had no record. When we first entered our room there was a very musty smell. Then we were surprised at how stained the carpet was. The furniture was all chipped and worn, the walls definitely needed painted. When we entered the little bathroom the paint peeling from the ceiling was quite obvious. I sprayed perfume in the room so we could stand to stay there. The one bed was apparent that most people slept on the left side, you rolled that way. I did bring it to the attention of the front desk and he said we could move the next day. The next morning while my husband was showering, he came out very unhappy. The obvious peeling paint was from the tub above our room, as it drained cold water on his head. We were then transfered to another room that wasn't much cleaner. When you opened the bathroom door it only opened half way as it got caught on the floor. Big tripping hazard. Will never stay there again. Spend a little more on another place, it will be well worth it. This place is WAY over priced and very unkept. Erga in the lounge was great though.

<Content>Pleasant but not luxury - will return Twice I have stayed here as a cheap alternative to the Westin, where I was at a conference. For $100 less per night, you get a perfectly adequate room. They may have done some work in the two years since I was last there. I found the room fine, though it and the bath were a bit small. Iron, coffee maker, hair dryer, lights and TV fine. The food is OK but the restaurant a bit on the dark side. I really liked my little room, except the windows are single pane and daytime traffic noise is a bit loud (get a room on the upper floor, or at the back).This is a budget hotel, but it is not a dive. Definitely a step up from Motel 6 style places. Lots of food in the places - just blocks from Westlake Center. Bed and linens were just fine. I have always found the staff to be pleasant.I'll stay there again.

<Content>Great location, great value It's a little tatty in some respects as you'd expect for the price but the rooms and bathrooms are clean, the shower is powerful, and the beds ( pillows) are comfortable. The bar is an unpretentious, simple pub - great if you don't want to be charged the earth for your drinks! It's great value and in a great location too - close to shopping, restaurants, bars and convenient for Pike Place market or the Seattle Centre.

<Content>Horrible Rooms and Management I stayed at this hotel in October.I booked this hotel for 3 people.The room that they call a three person room is a small dark 1 queen bed room with a folded bed they would bring in.Right after entering the room I requested a 2 queen room from the lobby.I had to pay extra ofcoarse.We got the bigger room on the 3rd floor.It was ok.Stains on the wall and one towel was a little dirty.The worst thing was that I was waken up at 6AM on a Sunday by paving work that was being done right behing the hotel.The man in the hotel lobby said the manager is not here and that they tried.The parking is OK.It is not underground.Some of it is undercover.As for the location,it wasnt bad.Not in the downtown core but in walking distance.Not so close to the Space Needle though.But for the similar accomodation just 2 blocks from the Sixth Avenue Inn I reccommend the Ramada.

<Content>Below Average Experience Rooms at the Sixth Avenue Inn were included with our Delta Weekend Getaway package to Seattle. While centrally located, the Inn is not a hotel we would choose for ourselves, nor is it one we would seek out again.The property is old and is showing its age. Rooms are cramped and dark. Furnishings are uncomfortable, from the extremely hard beds and to the rickety wicker patio furniture used in place of conventional chairs. High speed internet access is provided for $10.00 per day, but the port is wired to the wall and does not extend to the tiny nearby desk, making computers difficult to use. The pay-as-you-go terminal in the lobby is too slow and crippled to be worth the money. This is not a place to stay if you plan to work in your room.The front desk staff was helpful when we needed to fax and refax several documents.Breakfast in the restaurant is surprisingly hearty, but not something you'd seek out if you lived in Seattle. Breakfast is not included with your room.In the end, the property is not the best choice for business or vacation users, but might be a good solution for very young people who are looking for inexpensive rooms in the heart of Seattle.

<Content>bed from you know where Restaurant was great! Hotel staff was friendly and efficient. However, the beds are horrible and the rooms not clean. Our comforter smelled as if it had not be laundered in a long time, and the bathroom floor was nasty. The mattress was no better than sleeping on the floor.

<Content>Great location, small rooms, excellent breakfast I chose this hotel based on price and location. We only had one night in Seattle and didn't want to spend $200+ on a hotel room. I was a little worried because of the negative reviews, but we got exactly what I expected. Our rooms were ready for early check in at noon. Yes, they were small, but clean with plenty of nice towels. The location is great, walking distance to the Space Needle, Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square, and Pier 66. Right on the free downtown bus route and one block from the metro. You could stay across the street at the Westin and pay double or more. The breakfast at the Sixth Avenue Inn is phenomenal. Huge portions. If you check out the menu, the prices seem high, but you definitely get your moneys worth. And if Todd happens to be your waiter, you'll also get entertainment. I would stay here again, even for more than one night. For $89 a night, I have no complaints.

<Content>Sixth Ave inn is economy only... not a Boutique hotel... The hotel had some decent ratings, but when we drove up, I was a little taken back. It looks like any Motel 6/Rodeway Inn along any major interstate. The rooms all back up to 6th ave and it looks really cheap and dirty as you walk up. On the plus, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The room, as prior reviews described, were small at best. I had no problems with the room size, since that is what i expected. The Bed, however, was like sleeping on a plywood deck and that coupled with the street noise, made sleeping a challenge. ok, so much for the bad. like i said, the staff was nice, and the location was central to most anything in the area we wanted to see such as the space needle, pike st. market.If this motel were charging $59 a night, i would think it was a solid value and worth staying at, but at $120+ a night, it is a poor value in my book.I would not stay there again, and my wife was really pleased that we only spent one night there before we went on to Vancouver.

<Content>Good Location Stayed 2 nights, things to consider are your room location, the front of the hotel is on a busy street and with ear plugs was not a problem. We stayed on the 4th floor which was good. It is a good place to walk to most downtown attractions. The bus is free all day and is usefull if you want to go to a ballgameor other places within a few miles. Make sure you know the bus lines before you go. We took the train and if we had know what lines to take it would have been easy to get to the hotel. If you have a car it only cost $8 a day to park, which is a good deal since the lots charge around 25 per day. A great breakfast can be had a Lola's which is just 2 blooks away, get the continental which includes fruit, coffee and juice. This hotel is nothing special, but it was clean. The rooms are a little small compared to a 4 star hotel, but the price is right. No frills save on the cost, no in room coffee or pool but for those of us that do not need this it was just fine. Anyone just wanting a good room for sleeping this is the place for around $100 a night. Would return now that we know how to get around better.

<Content>Functional and friendly We stayed for 3 nights in September and this was our first ever trip to the USA. The staff were fantastic. Very friendly and helpful and even let me use the hotel phone to call my aunt in Canada (but didn't charge me) as I couldn't figure out the pay phone system.The room was a decent size with a comfortable bed and everything you need except for tea and coffee facilities which we found a bit odd. We enjoyed the friendly relaxed bar and found it very flattering that we were asked if we were over 21 (we are both 29)! The food wasn't much too shout about but there were huge portions and it arrived quickly. We soon learned to ask for half portions to get normal sized meals.Great location within walking distance to everything and felt safe when walking back to the hotel late at night. All in all, we enjoyed our stay there and would happily stay again.

<Content>Delightful surprise !!!! When we booked our room, we didn't quite know what to expect as far as cleanliness and service were concerned. Upon arrival to the hotel and our room, we were delighted with our accomodations and the service was great. The waiter in the restaurant-lounge deserves an honourable mention for his straight face and fast quips that kept us laughing.....the meals were delicious... hats off to the chef. Location is ideal and quick to a wide variety of activities. All in all, you couldn't go wrong with the Sixth Avenue Inn.....pleasant and very accomodating. We'll certainly keep coming back !! Thanks staff, you made it memorable for us.

<Content>Great value, excellent staff The 6th Ave Inn doesn't look like anything special, given the hotels thatsurround it. Low rise concrete motel like facade etc. Don't be fooled by this.The hotel offers very good value for money and is right in downtown Seattle.Plus points:Very good rates and locationHigh speed internet access in all rooms (you pay for this)WiFi in the lobby and restaurant.Good cozy bar and excellent value restaurant.Excellent helpful and friendly staffMinus points:Rooms a little care wornMaid service a little erratic but very friendly.Overall:Excellent. The staff makes or breaks any hotel and the people atthe 6th Ave Inn cannot be faulted. The front desk/restaurant staff aresuperbBest tips:Try Joe's special breakfast .... enough food for a week :-)Seattle's great public transport. Don't pay $35 for a taxi to and from the airport. Ride the #194 which stops at the Westlake centre a shortwalk from the hotel $1.25 off peak, $2.00 peak fare and just as quick !Plan your trips with:-----------Couldn't be easier !I'll certainly be back .

<Content>Excellent Location but Nothing Special Great location - very close to just about anything downtown - within walking distance to a lot of places to go and see. We flew in from Atlanta for the Tom Waits show at the Paramount and were only a few blocks away from the venue. We could have not been happier with the location. It is only a nice walk, short cab, trolley or bus ride from the market, the waterfront, the Space Needle, Pioneer Square, restaurants, shopping and everything else downtown.Pretty sparse ammenities - nothing fancy here about the grounds or rooms. If you are looking for anything more than a decent place to sleep, then this probably isn't for you. A bed, a shower, a TV and a window is about all that you get. Just what we needed but definately not for everybody. You can stay elsewhere for about the same or better price but you can't have the downtown location too.Misleading, uncaring or uninformed staff - If you fly in and do not arrange a rental car, do not believe the advertising or the staff about the transportation provided by or through the Sixth Avenue Inn. We were assured by the person that took our reservation that they could provide a shuttle to and from the airport for a small fee at any time. We would not have to worry about showing up and then trying to find a way to the hotel. We were told that they have shuttles run at least every 15 minutes and would bring us directly to the hotel - just to call when we were ready to leave the airport. Wrong. We called and the lady (rudely) knew nothing about a shuttle. We were told that we would have to find our own way to the hotel - that they didn't provide shuttles. We could try the Westin shuttle but they didn't run when our flight came in at 12:30 a.m. Luckily, it is not hard to find a cab ($30.00).Some of the staff are very friendly and helpful. They will have no problem giving you the correct directions or calling a cab which usually will show up on time with a nice, friendly driver.Although the hotel is affiliated (somehow or somewhat) with the Starwood Hotels  Resorts, we were quickly told and disappointed to find out that our member card is not accepted there.We would probably stay again now that we are more informed and know what to expect. It is a place to sleep in a wonderful location.

<Content>O.k. place for the price... I recently stayed here in Oct. 2004 for 4 nights. This was my first trip to Seattle so I was not familiar with the area or the hotel. For the price (about $70 a night), the room was fair but with some improvements, this could be a very nice hotel.Upon arriving, I noticed the hallways had a funny smell to them but the rooms were clean. The bathroom was very small...hard for 2 people to get ready. No mirror on the dresser so that made it difficult to get ready in the room while my husband showered. Needed extra towels since only one set per person were provided and they were thin...found a few extras in the dresser. Pillows were very lumpy and there was no iron or board in the room when we arrived.Front desk staff was very accomodating and helpful. Ate at the restaurant twice and had good food but the service was slow. Ordered a long island iced tea and was too strong. Tried to get the bartender to fix and she handed me a side of sweet 'n' sour to wash it down. I didn't drink it and was not charged but she commented that I should not order that kind of drink if I can't handle the liquor...not something you say to a patron paying for meals and drinks.Overall, would recommend it for a short stay of a few days but there are nicer places located more in the heart of downtown if you want to pay a bit more.

<Content>Disappointed The Sixth Avenue Inn could be a nice place to stay with some changes. The staff at the hotel were all very nice and tried to be helpful. I will not stay at the Sixth Avenue Inn again, nor would I recommend that anyone stay there. Some significant changes need to be made. I was assigned a smoking room (it was the last room). I was not told that the room was a smoking room while I was making the reservation. The bed was like a marble slab. The pillows were lumpy, spotted/dirty, and small. There were no extra blankets or pillows in the room. I mistook a bath towel for a hand towel because the towels were so small. The towels were also very thin and there were only enough towels for 1 person to use. I requested an ironing board and the cover on the board was so dirty I was totally grossed out. I had to put a towel over the cover to use it. The hotel was continuously understaffed. The hostess and the busboy were running around frantically in the restaurant - it was so sad to watch them try to take care of the guests. The maid service didn't come to our room until late in the afternoon. Upon arriving, the shampoo bottle in the room was already opened and it looked like shampoo was missing. Usually a hotel has a few problems, however this one just had too many. Too bad -- it could be a nice hotel.

<Content>Priced right When the price is right, the price is right. Plusses: Awesome front desk staff: let us check in early, made recommendations on food and tours. Good location: walking to downtown Seattle, right next to Budget car rentals. Good sized room.Minuses: Don't try to share a bed with someone, the beds move with every little jiggle! Rooms are definitely showing their age and are dinged at the edges, towels are rather small and although clean, did show some permanent stains.Misc: They have a computer with internet access (pay to play) in the lobby, the basic tv is standard, and they have pay-per-view movies as well. they have a restaurant we didn't eat at and are adjacent to McDonalds.

<Content>not worth the money The hotel bathroom is very small, and don't expect any extras. The towels were very small and very thin. There is no coffee,etc. I was told one price on the phone and the rate was ten dollars higher upon arrival, plus they charge for parking which is a perk at several of the other hotels. The rooms were clean, and the hotel is in a great location. Be sure to put your do not disturb sign up, however it really doesn't matter because the housekeeper began knocking on doors around 7:30 and yelling housekeeping she let herself into every room on the floor opening and shutting every door--very annoying! Stay here if you are offered a good rate, but get it in writing.
