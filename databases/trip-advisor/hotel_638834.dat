<Content>Excellent location, service and cleanliness A quick 鈧?5.00 cab ride from Tegel airport, we were greeted by friendly and efficient reception staff at Hotel Berlin, Berlin who spoke excellent English. They were very helpful with maps and tips about where to eat - as it was Christmas time, they had called ahead to all the local restaurants to check whether they were open so they would be able to definitively advise guests. We thought this was a really good little extra service.We had a triple superior room which was clean, modern and extremely spacious. Excellent facilities with everything you need. Great shower and heating which was very necessary after a day out in the cold!Absolutely fantastic breakfasts with everything you could possibly want: pastries, fresh fruit, multiple choices of yoghurts, cereals, cheeses, cold meats, about 5-6 different loaves of fresh breads, mini baguettes, scrambled and boiled eggs, bacon, grilled tomatoes, etc etc. Everything was fresh, well presented and tasty.Nice cocktail bar - we had a couple of very nice cocktails there.The location was excellent - just outside the hotel is the 100 bus which is the best bus for anyone visiting the city as it stops at all the sights of Berlin and runs every few minutes. Also, only about a 10 minute walk to the nearest U-bahn station which was also handy when we were going in a slightly different direction. You probably won't need much more than the 100 bus, but there's also the Zoo Garden station nearby (about 2 mins on the 100 bus, or about a 15 minute walk) which is a major transport hub. It was so easy to get to and from anywhere in the city from the hotel - we thought it was a brilliant location. Also, it was nice and quiet as it's not right in the thick of the main part of the city. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff - who were helpful and friendly all the way through our 4 night stay - even though it was Christmas time and I'm sure they would rather not have been working!Very highly recommended hotel!

<Content>A great city hotel at an amazing price The hotel was part of a bargain buy from Travelzoo for a 4 night package with flights. Some of the previous reviews were mixed, especially about the location and size of rooms and the hotel's love affair with conferences.Actually, the hotel is in a decent location, 15 minutes from the Zoological Gardens on foot and 5 minutes from a very central and convenient tube station (the city is massive, so location is really by the by). The room we had was a neutral but modern mini suite with everything I'd expect from a 4*. In fact, it was a really good standard.There were a couple of conferences on but our treatment wasn't marginalised by it at all. In fact, the bar was great for people watching on those evenings. The staff were courteous, spoke great English and gave us a late checkout.My only gripe was that we were only given one teabag or cappuccino sachet between us which seems a little stingy.For everything else, if you get a good deal, go for it. This is a decent hotel by anyone's standards.Oh and Berlin is the most incredible city.

<Content>Excellent Hotel. I have a weekend trip with my daughter to Berlin.The hotel is really big, with a nice lobby and the check in was very efficient .The room and the bathroom extremely clean and very confortable, and new flat TV.No noise from outside .Especial attention to the breakfast, is one of the best I have ever had. All that you can imagin is there.Location is really good, there is a bus number 100, stops in front of the hotel that goes to the most important points of view.You have to buy a daily ABC ticket for euros 6.20 and you can go up and down all the times you want from buses, underground and trains.Berlin is a very nice city.

<Content>Great Hotel I had great difficulty getting a room for 3 nights in October - I think there were many conferences going on. However, I eventually came across this hotel and I'm really pleased I did. It cost me 拢300 for 3 nights bed and breakfast and whilst perhaps expensive it was worth it. We had a lovely twin room with sitting area, comfy beds and even a balcony. Pretty good. The hotel has been completely modernised and everything is first class. The array of food for breakfast is excellent and location wise it is only a 鈧? taxi ride to the underground/station at the Zoo. Yes we could have walked 15 minutes but we were lazy. All in all I would recommend this place and I would return.

<Content>Excellent hotel I stayed here for 5 nights with my partner on our first trip to Berlin. The staff were very friendly and spoke English. We booked via lastminute.com and got a really good deal. The location is excellent, just 5 mins down the road from a main train station which is great to catch a train to anywhere in the city and the area itself has loads of cool cafes and bars.We stayed in a Classic room which was cosy and big. We were surprised that instead of a double bed, we had 2 single beds pushed together however we enquired about this and were told that was normal (?!). It didn't dampen the stay as the beds and big duvets and pillows were really comfy.We didn't have breakfast at the hotel but we did sample the bar (open till 2) and that was really nice. Would definitely return here.

<Content>Excellent choice We stayed in Hotel Berlin for 6 nights from August 8th. We had an excellent last minute package deal (flight and accommodation) and we picked the hotel out of 30 other choices based on Tripadvisor reviews, which we found very usefull. We arrived to the hotel in the early morning hours, and stowed our luggage in the storage room until 3 PM when we checked in. From our experience we recommend to referesh and change clothes in the spacious and clean WC near the reception before leaving the hotel. We had more than 7 hours before check in. We got a room on the 5th. floor facing the hotel inwards, preferably because we usually sleep with open windows. The room was very large and clean. The beds including the roll-away couch which my daughter slept on where comfortable. In the room was a seperate air conditioning unit which we found not so covenient (most of the hotel rooms are equipped with a built-in unit), but it was mobile so we oriented it to throw air aside. Breakfast is really suberb, highly rich buffet, everything is fresh and tasty, try to avoid the rush hour of 0800-0830 AM. The hotel is very clean in the room and in all the public areas. The staff is very helpfull, although not so cordial. Location is excellent, you can walk to the central places, or take bus # 100 which is very frequent. The only issue we had was ironing, that is not available in the room and there are no ironing facilities except in charge service.

<Content>4 stars? Maybe 3 We stayed at the Hotel Berlin twice, once at the beginning of a tour and again at the end of the tour. The room we had on the first occasion was roomy, clean and quite comfortable. The room we were given on our return was so small that we were unable to open our suitcases unless we put one on the bed. Whilst the room was clean and had a small balcony, it was too small to be comfortable and we were glad that we were only staying 2 nights. There is a restaurant (which didn't seem to be open when we were there) and a bar/cafe where meals can be ordered and eaten in the open courtyard. Breakfast was good with an excellent range of food which should please just about everyone.The hotel is located close to the main shopping area (Kurfurstendamm) and a pleasant walk through the Tiergarten to the Brandenburg Gate and Unter Den Linden.I would happily stay at the hotel again but would ensure that we had a larger room. I question whether it is really a 4 star hotel taking into account other 4 star hotels I have used in Europe.

<Content>Greedy at the expense of residents Whilst the hotel is functional rather than luxurious they are willing to disregard the needs of normal residents to pander to the corporate function market. A conference at the hotel will mean that you are denied access to the main public areas such as the bar and will have your movement around the hotel restricted even if that does mean walking around the hotel in the rain.. it is clear that they value the corporate custom much more than that of individual travelers. Whilst it may be a business decision to do so the independent traveler should be aware of where they stand in the hotel's regard.

<Content>Nice stay I took my girlfriend to Berlin to celebrate my birthday. We stayed 4 nights in this hotel and I must say the hotel is really nice, the room we stayed was big and comfortable and the service staff were quite friendly. This is a large hotel but you really feel looked after. The bar has a nice atmosphere, shame the rain spoilt my beer in the garden....

<Content>Promises much, delivery lacking Based upon a number of the positive reviews, we booked two nights at the Hotel Berlin in July. Once in the lobby areas, the hotel is very impressive. From the outside, it was clear this was a refurbished old building, however the interior shared areas of the hotel are very modern.Our room however was mixed in its appeal. The room was large, a big plus, however the furnishings appeared quite dated (so we assume perhaps either this area hasn't been renovated or they are keeping this area at low quality). The problem with a large room such as this is it has significant window area, and given it was the height of summer, this room was boiling hot by lunchtime. The air-conditioner in the room was a small unit that looked 20 years old that sat in the corner - which had no controls other than an on-off switch, and was quite useless in cooling the room (and would switch itself off often). This translated to very limited sleep during the night. The bathroom is reasonable.We went for dinner on our first night to the Restaurant Julius, only to find the restaurant closes through part of Summer? I could not understand this given this was the main a-la-carte restaurant and Summer would arguably be one of the busiest times of the year. As a result we had to eat in the Garden Cafe, where the Garden was average and the menu was pretty unimpressive. The bar area inside however is very nice.Overall this hotel promises a lot from the interior areas, however the rooms and the dining options fail to support this hotels claim of 4 stars. In addition its location is not the most convenient.

<Content>Great hotel Stayed for two nights in July. The hotel was spotlessly clean throughout. The reception, bar and restaurant staff all appeared to speak very good English, much better than London hotels I have recently stayed in.Our room was large with a balcony, overlooking other parts of the hotel. We were not asked if we wanted a non smoking room and consequently there was a smell of smoke in the room. We didn鈥檛 notice any noise from with in or outside the hotel. The hotel is well placed in the centre of Berlin only minutes walk from the Tiergarten. We arrived at Tegel Airport on a Friday afternoon, traffic was very heavy but the taxi fare was still less then 20 Euros. Because time was short we ate in the hotel restaurant both evenings. The meals including wine were expensive but good quality and the service was excellent. Bar food was also available.There was an extensive choice of good quality food available at breakfast. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Excellent I was delighted with the Hotel Berlin. My wife, daughter and I stayed in what the call a classic room ie the smallest size but at 30 square metres it was excellent, There was loads of room and it was very clean with loads of storage space. The lobby, check in and bar are excellent with first class check in. My only complaint was that there was no safe in the room although I had no reason to be concerned.The location is excellent 15mins walk to the Sony Centre whcih we used as a focal point and 10mins to the shopping area. The main tourist sights and shopping areas are in different directions. Berlin itself was great and I would recommend it for a city break - we were there 3 nights and I was sorry we didnt book a day or two longer.We got a taxi from Scohodale airport it was handy and cost 35 euro. There is an excellent resturant outside the hotel (200 m to the right opposite the green) its expensive a meal for 3 with 2 half crafts of wine 180 euro but the food was excellent. The Sony centre has a selection of 4/5 resturants the Ozzie one is the best and do try the kanagroo steak. And do take a bus tour its a great way to get your bearings of the city and main sitesSo if you booked this hotel you will be pleased

<Content>Great Hotel, Great City Have just returned from a 4 day break in Berlin and am buzzing with the delights of the city. The hotel was better than expected, i used trip advisor to choose so had read reviews but you can never be too sure, it was very business like but still leisure tourist friendly. The room was very clean and comfortable and it's location was central to all the main parts of Berlin as the public transport system is second to none. Buy an all day ticket for 6E 20. and travel anywhere in Berlin all day, the buses are every 2 mins right across the street from the hotel.We didn't try the restaurant in the hotel so can't comment on the food other that a quick snack from room service one night which was very nice.Berlin itself is facinating i totally recommend The Insider walking tour which is run by English tour guides, we would return just to take another of their tours.

<Content>Great place to stay My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel at the beginning of May and it was perfect. It is in a great location, the hotel is very modern on the inside (the outside isn't as nice) and there are always people at the bar! We ate at the hotel just once - the grill they have in the garden and the food was really good. The other meals were eaten in town and they were cheaper however hotel food is always more expensive where ever you go.The best way to get there from the airport: buy a welcome at the airport (such good value for money) then take the S9 bus to RUDOW subway station (takes around 8 minutes). Once at the subway station, take the U7 line towards Rathaus Spandau, and get off at the 14th stop (I think) called Mockernbrucke. Then take the U3 line towards Uhlandstr and get off at the 3rd stop Nollendorfplatz. The hotel is then literally a 4 minute walk from here. This is the easiest way to get from the airport and it does not take that long at all and is fairly straight forward. Most Berlin travel books have an U and S-Bahn map in them so just follow the lines!I would definitely recommend this hotel - it's very nice, clean, modern, and it is in a superb location! The Berlin zoo, Tiergarden, and Zoologischer Garten train station is only around a 10-15 walk from the hotel.Enjoy!

<Content>Ok for a great rate! I just got back from the great city of Berlin, me and my mates stayed for 3 nights at Hotel Berlin, Berlin.At first the hotel makes a great first impression with a nice looking lobby and bar, pleasant and efficient staff, when you get to the rooms though you do get a bit dissapointed, though our rooms were nice in size it does not even look half as good as the lobby and also house keeping was not really on point, plenty of small but so important details were overlooked. For the rate that we paid, approx, 150鈧?per night i was suprised that the rooms were so big, our rooms both had a sofa and 2 chairs, considering the rates i must say that if only housekeeping had been on point i would have rated the overall stay much higher. But when the first thing you find when you walk in the room is a used plaster, and even though they have big dispensers of soap you run out, all our empty soda  beer bottles were left in the room, the bathroom in one of our rooms smelled of urine, its just too much to not be bothered about.

<Content>Good place to stay for a reasonable price I stayed here recently with a large group, and was pleased with the hotel over all. The front desk staff were pleasant answered questions, exchanged money and at one point tried to help us find an adapter. The room was very spacious and comfortable although I will say coming fromt the states it was a little odd not to have a bathcloth as part of your bathroom linens, just something to remember if your staying here. Some friends stayed in the newer part of the hotel and I have to say that our room in the older part of the hotel was much more comfortable and bright with two little balconies.I was not impressed by any of the food that the hotel offered, room service breakfast or the bar. You can find better in all regards near by for a lot less. We walked a good bit the area is nice and quiet. The closest U-Bahn stop is just a couple of blocks from the hotel and a very easy walk, just be mindful of the bike lane, we were nearly killed a couple of times. :D The area felt safe and we walked around day and night four women with out any problems at all. We did however see a couple of prostitutes on the corner at the backside of the hotel 4 out of the 6 nights we were there, not that they caused any trouble but they were there.The little pub on the corner across from the rear of the hotel has good German food and beer and a nice outdoor patio. The tiny Cafe Rosen right next door has good MilcheKaffe in the morning along with a nice pastry for a very reasonable price.We really enjoyed our stay even if we were a few U-Bahn stops from the tourist sites, it was nice and relaxing and the staff was helpful.

<Content>Very nice - but not a design hotel My husband and I went on a romantic weekend to Berlin and decided to stay at Hotel Berlin. We were very happy with this decision. Being parents with small children we usually are wakened a couple of times a night. Here we had a few nights of wonderful sleep - we really appreciated that the room was very soundproof. Though the hotel is big, and was heavily booked when we stayed there, we did not hear a sound from outside.I also loved the state of the room. It was spacious and seemed recently renovated. The bathroom was spotlessly clean. Breakfast was rich in variety, my only complaint beacause of the booking situation the breakfast room was quite crowded.If you're looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a good location - this is a very good choice. However, the funky photos on the hotel website made us believe that this was some kind of design hotel. This is not the case, the lobby is quite quirky but the rest of the hotel is traditional. Not a problem for us, but if you want to stay in a design hotel you should go somewhere else.

<Content>Beautiful Berlin Firstly the photos online of this hotel do it no justice! The hotel is much better than it looks online. The foyer area is huge and the staff at the check in desks are really friendly and helpful. You walk through the bar to get to the elevators to the rooms. The bar itself was spotless clean with a wide variety of drinks and snacks on offer. The only complaint I had with the bar was that it was a bit more expensive than the bars around the hotel itself. Try the currywurst from the snack menu, its a must. The lift to the room and the halls leading down to the rooms are also spotless clean (the whole hotel itself is kept immaculately clean). The rooms are quite big with large comfy double beds and a bathroom with a bath and shower. Room service can be ordered 24/7. The only complaint I had with the room is that it does not contain a safe. If you want to leave your valuables in a safe place you can do so by leaving them in a safety deposit box at the hotels reception. The buffet breakfast has something for everyones tastes but can get quite crowded at the weekends. The location of the hotel is excellent as it is right around the corner for the Kudamm (Berlin's massive shopping street) and also the KaDeWe (Belin's equivalent of Harrods in London). There are only a handful of bars located in the hotels local, some being Barman located at the back of the hotel and also Bar Am Lutzoplatz infront of the hotel. If you are looking for nightlife its best to hop into a cab and ask the driver where the best place to go is.

<Content>Good enough Decent four star hotel. Smart looking from the inside. Very spacious room. Staff friendly enough. Location good (10/15 minutes from Zoo train station but probably better to get the 100 bus which stops right outside the hotel). Definitely buy a Welcome Card for unlimited public transport and discounts on most museums. Berlin itself is amazing! Enjoy!

<Content>I'd recommend this hotel We travelled to Hotel Berlin in a large group and everything about the hotel perfectly fitted our needs. One mistake was to walk from the main station to the hotel, should have taken a taxi as the walk - in the snow - was too far for some of us.The hotel is large with nicely decorated public areas and helpful staff. The hotel bar is a great meeting place but not cheap. The walk to the underground is direct and takes around 10 minutes but the whole of Berlin is then at your disposal. The staff at reception recommended a nearby restaurant for our last evening and it was a fantastic find. There's a fab cocktail bar (Bar am Lutzowplatz?) across the square from the hotel and they do a half price offer most nights - well worth a visit! Our room was in the main wing and while it was huge, it wasn't particularly modern. We had a great sitting area and the room was cosy throughout our stay even though the temperatures outside were well below freezing. Bathroom was nice, view was a concrete block but in all the room met all our requirements.One of our party stayed in the new wing and they had a modernised room with flat screen tv and much more modern furnishings. Breakfast was an expensive addition but extremely tasty, I'd advise trying to get a package that includes breakfast.

<Content>Great Hotel We booked this hotel after seeing it on Octopus so we were not sure what to expect and had seen mixed reviews on trip advisor.When we arrived the receptionist informed us that we had cancelled the booking - which we had not. There was no problem though, she simply found us a room and arranged for the third bed to be brought up although we didn't need it as the room had a great bed settee.Our expereince was very good.the location was great fro Ku'dam - shopping. Bars were close by that we were interested in.Transport links were great - the directions on the hotel website were very accurate.Previous comments read mentioned that it was close to the gay district - it was (ish)Prostitutes were alos mentioned and they were evident at night close by but they were only there looking for kerb crawlers and they did not bother anyone walking around the districtThe hotel was very clean and the staff very attentive and friendly - they could not be faulted. They gave us infromation when we needed and our luggage was looked after for us on the day we checked out.The room was spacious - only thing lacking was a kettle - coffee from the bar was not great and quite pricey.We only had breakfast booked for the last day and that was enough - there was masses of food and we could not have eaten a lot in the morning so it would have been a waste but it was nice on the last morning as we had a long day ahead.The only down side of the locationis that there is not much around inthe way of getting a coffee or something in the morning - I am always first up and like to go a wander but there was nothing very near.Overall though i would rate this hotel very highly and would recommend it for any type of trip - romantic, business, short break, family...

<Content>Central position The Hotel is very well placed about 10 mins walk from a U bahn station, so ideal for exploring all Berlin and the Christmas markets! Hotel looks like a concrete box, but is ok inside. We had a very small but more than adequate room, I think it was the smallest on the floor as our friend's room was much larger. No tea/coffee facilities which was a shame, but it did have a mini bar! Restaurant food was ok but decor boring brown.Breakfasts were huge; massive choice of all sorts of things and quite tasty and filling. Staff all spoke excellent English and were very helpful indeed with maps and directions. Would stay there again for the location as much as anything else.

<Content>Very clean and well presented Initially on checking in, we were booked into a dirty room. Not the best start. We returned to reception where they duly apologised and changed our room. The room was just as we expected. Very clean, comfortable bed, superb bathroom and excellent value for money. The lobby and lift area was very clean and had a constant buzz around the place. Ideally situated island bar with plenty of space to find to sit.Breakfast was superb with a wide variety of world breakfasts on offer. My only gripe was that being an Englishman I couldn't find any breakfast tea amongst the other flavours they had.Location was ideal being only a short walking distance to the local under/overground station. The tiergarten was only a 15 min walk also, as was the popular area of West Berlin which was abundant with restaurants and shops. Excellent value for money and would stay here again if returning to this wonderful city.

<Content>Nice hotel The inside doesn't look like the outside. Seems the hotel has been refurbished not too long ago, the interior design is nice.The room and bathroom are modern and clean. We didn't have to wait long to check-in/out, but given the size of the hotel I would except some queues during peak hours.The restaurant serves good food but pricey (for Berlin) and the service was very chaotic (they kept forgetting our orders and mixing them).The hotel provides free wifi Internet access, always a bonus point.

<Content>Good Location We stayed at the Hotel Berlin at the beginning and again at the end of our tour, Sept-Oct. '07. It is a large hotel. The lobby and restaurants are very nice. Our room was small but decorated nicely and the bathroom was well equiped. It only had liquid soap in the shower, no toiletries. There was a grocery store nearby and several nice restaurants. It was in a good location for walking. We would stay here again .

<Content>Was OK We stayed here for 3 nights Oct 14th to 17th. The outside looks terrible, like a warehouse, but the inside is fine. The rooms here are huge and bathrooms as well. The only complaint we had were the pillows, or excuse for pillows.The breakfast buffet that was included was fantastic, everything was there.

<Content>Nice, clean and confortable Hotel My partner and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in Aug.We booked our stay through Expedia and got a great deal although we had to pay in advance.The room was very nice and the free Wi Fi was great for sending emails after a day of sire seeing.We found the Hotel was a little expensive for meals so we ate out most nights. We found a grocery store that was 5 mins away by foot so we bought food to make lunch.We did see the tourist buses arrive which made the reception very busy. But this wasn't really an issue for us.We were driving through Europe and had a car, parking at he hotel was 17 Euros a day (very expensive) but because we got a great deal on the room it worked out OK.If we travel again we would would consider staying here again.

<Content>Convenient, Central, Comfortable hotel in Berlin We stayed in the Hotel Berlin, Berlin for a week in July 2007. We had chosen it from a search on the Internet and were well pleased with its location, facilities and service.The hotel has WiFi access throughout and was very useful to us during our stay there, in fact, it was one of the reasons the hotel was short-listed in the begining.The Breakfast Dining Room was opened from 6.30 am until 10.30 am. There was a very comprehensive spread of food supplied for Breakfast with at least three Fruit Juices alone.There were plentiful supplies topped up very regularly by the efficient staff.The bed-room was as described with all the facilities necessary to make your stay comfortable. TV, Tea/Coffee making facilities, Bath  Shower complete with Shampoos etc.The only thing that was not functioning was the internal Safe but we were offered the use of the Hotel Safety Deposit Boxes at the Reception for any valuables, etc.The hotel is located on the Bus 100 Route and was convenient and central from that point of view. It is a short stroll to visit KaDeWe Department Store in one direction and Tiergarten in the opposite way. Zoogarten area is also within walking distance from where you can get a bus, etc to almost anywhere in Berlin or Germany indeed.

<Content>Nice, but caters more for conferences Decent hotel very well placed for the 100 bus. Our room was an upgrade apparently but still quite small.When we were there it was full of conferences who monopolised the staff to a greater extent. We did have a few questions with regard to bike tours, restaurants etc but they really werent interested in helping. Maybe just got them on a bad day.We got a cheap deal through lastminute.com secret hotels site so cant complain.I can thoroughly recommend the Cafe Einstein round the corner (right out of the front of the hotel, right again, first left, 50 yards on the left) for a cheap and very filling brunch. Old building, charming waiters, lovely atmosphere. The fat tire bike tour which we eventually found was excellent.

<Content>Excellent hotel at reasonable cost This hotel is well run, with spacious rooms and helpful staff. It is fairly handy for nearby restaurants, Barman Bar, a convenience store and buses and metro to places of interest. For this standard of accommodation, I felt the (online) rates were very reasonable. The room was modern, with separate beds pushed together (just the job for a good night's sleep), and everything worked well - the air-conditioning was quiet and effective, although the windows could be opened if required. Unfortunately, our room overlooked a busy road, so this meant keeping them closed. The double glazing was very good, though, so the room was beautifully quiet, and we heard not a sound from any other guests, although the hotel was full. I would certainly consider this hotel again for a future visit to Berlin.

<Content>Nice room, free WiFi Booked a double room for two nights through lastminute.com (top secret hotel) for 150 Euro (without breakfast). We were very happy with our stay, nice room, free wifi. Good location, short walk to U-bahn, some nice bars and restaurants nearby. Try Bar am Lutzowplatz for great drinks. Didn麓t try the hotel restaurant or bar, seemed a bit pricey. Overall a very nice weekend in Berlin!

<Content>Overpriced and Poor Location I stayed at Hotel Berlin for three nights (August 16-19th, 2007). I had great expectations for this hotel since the reviews were pretty good. I was disappointed for the following reasons:1-the nearest u-bahn station was a good walk away2-there was nothing around the hotel (no grocery stores, no entertainment). The hotel seems to be situated in a business district.3-the hotel overcharged for everything, knowing that tourists would pay since there were no services available nearby. For example, breakfast was 17 euro per person..., 2 euro to get a pair of socks washed...4-the minute it got dark outside, prostitutes lined up on the street of the hotel, one block away. 5-unfriendly and rude customer service. The attendant cleaning the room in the morning was the nicest person I encountered at the hotel.Overall, I feel I paid too much for what I got. I value location over almost everything else, and I felt the hotel was very poorly located. I would not go back.

<Content>Disappointed: 3 star quality in a 4 star skin This hotel tries for a trendy boutique surface, but underneath the gloss are a number of problems. First, there are not enough people at the front desk. A tour bus arrived right before we did, and there were thirty people waiting to register, and only two people on the desk, with no queuing system so some people elbowed their way to the front of the line, raising the frustration level. Later in our stay, there was always a wait at reception. Other problems: the air conditioning has an automatic shutoff, and only one setting--on or off. So at night, you have to get up and turn it on again every few hours. The water in the shower can go from hot to cold in a split second, and never stays the same temperature for very long. The fitness center consists of: a treadmill, a stationery bicycle, some dumbbells and a second rate universal gym. And the restaurant was spotty. The main course was a lowlight (overcooked fish), the desserts were excellent.Another problem was the location. It sounds great: the middle of Berlin. But to quote Gertrude Stein, there's no there there. There are low rise office buildings, but no shops or restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Lutzowplatz, the square the hotel borders on is overgrown with weeds. There are some nice stores and cafes past the subway station, about five blocks away.On the other side of the coin, our maid was very responsive when we put out the sign for cleaning. The reception area staff were friendly, helpful and fluent in English (once you waited in line to speak with them). The wireless internet was free, and worked without any problems.

<Content>a disaster Arrived at the reception with a party of 12 to find that the reservations had not been processed and our rooms were not ready ,this was at 1400 were then told to come back in four hours..not good so far .On returning to the hotel to be told the reception did not know if the rooms were ready. this was a lie we kew this because a member of our party is involved with the hotel industry and he spotted the unprocessed checkin documents on the reception desk..! we had to wait another two hours befor we were even told what was going on. reception was a mess. when the manager was asked for the receptionist was sent out and was very rude and unhelpful in the mater. While we all found the staff in general very nice and helpful. reception and management was arrogant and rude i could not recomend this hotel as a good place to stay in berlin. In my opinion this hotel did not give me the four star experience i had paid for and left berlin very dissapointed.

<Content>Great Hotel My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend in May. We booked through the Ryan Air website and got a very good deal. We found the hotel was to a high standard. It was quite busy when we were there catering for conferences. Our room was very big and quiet and it was very clean and looked like it had been done up not so long ago. The location is ideal for sight seeing in the city and there is an excellent bar literally across from the hotel in Lutzowplatz that is ideal for cocktails and in staggering distance of the hotel. We didn't eat at the hotel but tried the restaurant Lochner in Lutzowplatz which was very nice and the staff were very attentive and helpful. Was a bit apprehensive with regard to whether I would enjoy Berlin but I would definitely recommend this hotel and the city, lots to do and the people are friendly.

<Content>Excellent Location This is a great hotel, wonderfully located in downtown Berlin within walking distance of the Hard Rock Caf茅 and several other attractions. It's very high end, ironically reminds me of the Hotel Vancouver back home. The on-site dining had a limited selection and I found the cuisine to be a bit lacking. The room numbering and elevator system seemed overly complex and we got lost a couple times looking for our room. In the end though it was a wonderful facility, I would definitely stay again.

<Content>Absolutely okay A modern and well equipped hotel for tourists and business travelers. My group of 15 people stayed for 3 nights and we all found the hotel fully satisfactory. The rooms are spacious and the furniture and beds would suit most people. The bathroom is large and modern. The location is good and fairly central.I would have liked the breakfast system to be different. Some rooms are booked including breakfast and some without. Our didn't have breakfast, so we had to buy it for 17 euro per person which I think is far too expensive. It is a bit like a hidden price raise. However no complaints about the breakfast itself.

<Content>Plush hotel at a bargain price Stayed for 5 nights and not one complaint about this nice modern hotel. Bedroom and particularly bathroom were spotless, and the room itself was spacious and quiet. Didn't eat any food at the hotel during our stay but the menu looked good! 2 minute walk from the underground station, and plenty of taxis right outside the hotel should you need one. The only thing that made this a 4 rather than 5 star review is the desk staff being not particularly friendly. They weren't rude or unhelpful, just a smile would be nice when welcoming guests to your hotel!

<Content>Great hotel We (my fiance and I) visited Berlin for her birthday at the end of February. As we had a late flight (thank you Easyjet!) we took a taxi from Schonefeld airport to the hotel; it cost about 30 euros so not too expensive. Check in was quick and easy; all the staff at check-in spoke excellent English and they were very efficient. The room was quite spacious, as was the bathroom. The bed was quite strange however; we asked for a king size bed and we were given two large singles pushed together! Although, the top sheets were pulled over both beds so there wasn't any danger of falling through the gap in the night!! Also, rather than having one king size quilt we were given two single quilts. I found that strange, but it didn't affect either of us.The bathroom had two excellent mirrors and the shower was decent; it was a shower in a bath though and I'm not a big fan of those but it's not a real problem or complaint.The air conditioning is strange; well, it was hard to fathom and I ended up having to turn it off at night or else it was too hot to sleep!My only real complaint of this hotel is the lack of toiletries in the bathroom; all you get is an all-in-one soap dispenser, which is not good enough for a 4* hotel in my opinion.Restaurant Julius serves some excellent food and I think it was competitively priced. You expect hotels to be more expensive than outside restaurants but I didn't think this was the case. The bar also sells some excellent beer and again the price was not as expensive as I expected.All in all though, an excellent hotel and I would stay here again.

<Content>Comfort, convenience and great value in the centre of Berlin Have just stayed at the Hotel Berlin for 3 nights on a citybreak to Berlin. The location is great - it's just a ten minute walk to the Ku'Damm in one direction and the new National Gallery/culture complex in another. Nearest underground is a few minutes away and the Bauhaus Archive is just across the road! The hotel itself is modern, stylish and extremely comfortable withe pleasant public areas and a nice bar area. I stayed in a small single room and couldn't fault it - nice decor, great use of space and it still managed to be comfortable even though small (unusual in a single room!) Staff are helpful and friendly. The hotel restaurant is lovely, serving a modern European menu with a few 'local' specialties. The ambience is quiet and stylish, the food is delicious and nicely presented and the service is friendly, knowledgable and efficient. Very importantly - the staff treat people dining alone just as well as they do couples or groups. I was made to feel a welcome and valued customer (again, unusual in a lot of restaurants!) All in all I was really impressed and would happily stay there again and recommend the hotel particularly to single travellers.

<Content>Lovely hotel and conveniently placed. Very impressed with the staff on reception. Nice surprise in our room - a bowl of fruit! The bar was a good place to relax and we ate dinner in the Julius Restaurant on the first night which was very good. Nice little touch on valentines day to receive a box of chocolates each. The hop on hop off bus tour stops right outside the hotel and there is a train station within a few hundred yards. 4 blocks I believe. The same distance as Germany's equivalent of Harrods - the Ka de We.

<Content>Loved the sights Berlin: Hotel Berlin Date: 11th Feb-14th February 2007Reviewer : Karen  Mitch from Scotland.We have just returned from 4 days at the Hotel Berlin, Berlin Germany. Great staff especially in the Bar Berlin within the hotel.Room clean and well equipped, lovely and warm as the weather was -4. Recommend the Berlin City Tour, (yellow bus) which stops outside hotel, well worth 20 euros, hop on hop off tour which covered all the sights. Recommend The Allegro Restaurant within the Europa Centre, food delicious and staff friendly, next door is a great Irish Bar which is huge, and has live music every night till 3.00am. Really mixed age group. Recommend for shopping, Ka de Wa, fantastic especially the food floor, 6th Floor. Also Potsdammer Platz Arcades. Prices are much cheaper than the UK. We never had a bad meal during our trip and also the bars were friendly. Recommend a trip to the Berliner Dom (cathedral). We will definately return in the summer and stay at Hotel Berlin.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Stayed at this hotel 7th - 9th December. First of all, it is not known locally as The Clarion Hotel but as Hotel Berlin so don't be surprised if the taxi drivers don't know where it is! Also, it doesn't look very impressive as you approach - just a large block - but when you go inside its a differennt story.We thought it was an excellent hotel. We were checked in efficiently and all the reception staff had good english. I had had my wallet stolen at the airport and they were very helpful making phone calls etc. for me. They also allowed me to use the internet free any time I needed to. Our room on the 3rd floor was lovely. We didn't use the restaurant at all. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas and it was always lovely and warm. The location was excellent and I cannot agree with a previous contributor that the area was unsafe. All in all, I would have to rate this hotel highly. Our visit to Berlin was ruined by the theft of wallet containing cash and credit and ATM cards but the hotel didn't let us down and we would hope to go back some time. We went to the Christmas Market at Spandau and it was lovely too - it has to be one of the best markets in the area. It was about a 20 minute trip on the SBahn. A Taxi to Schonefeld Airport was 鈧?0 whch was very reasonable.

<Content>very good location Stayed here for three nights, 15 euros for taxi from Tegel airport. underground station within 5 mins walk of hotel 15 euros for 48 hour pass.5 min walk to Ka-De-We a very good location for sight seeing, all staff spoke english so no problems there clean, large room.Booked via airmiles flights with BA and hotle 拢310 for three nights including breakfast - which was excellent - resturant is good quality but a little pricey when compared to walking 5 mins to the main street, also offerd a limited menu.

<Content>Not great The Hotel is clean and central. The rooms are quite big, but only part of the house has been updated. When we encountered a problem (i.e. no hot water for a whole morning) reception staff were very unhelpful, ranging from unfriendly to sarcastic. There was no apology and I just think that a big international hotel like this should have personnel who are charming and nice when such things happen.

<Content>4 star service We were pleasantly surprised by the standard of the hotel. It is a large hotel and very busy - when we visited there was an exhibition and the lobby and bars were full of men in suits manning stands. My feeling was that it is primarily a business hotel. Not much in the way of Tourist Information but it may have been tucked away because of the exhibition. Spotlessly clean, the rooms were spacious. We had requested a quiet room - that is exactly what we got. We had to request bath towels as there were none but that was dealt with swiftly so no complaint there. The service was excellent and staff friendly.  We ate a couple of times at Julius鈥?restaurant in the hotel and the food was excellent as was the service. Not particularly cheap though! In the morning, you can enjoy a quick coffee and croissant in the bar and although we did not have a proper breakfast in the restaurant, reports from other guests indicated that it was good.All in all we liked Berlin 鈥?not a beautiful city like Paris or Prague but incredibly interesting especially the area that was East Berlin.We would recommend a city break there.

<Content>great place to stay stayed here with my partner for a weekend break, rooms clean and comfortable, the maids visited every day to clean the rooms including sundays.on a whole staff were very friendly and helpful. agree with other reviews, people who have complained about being in seedy area with prostitutes etc. must have been staying in a different hotel as we experienced nothing that would worry us. excellent location for visiting the city with a bus stop across the street as well as a u-bahn station around the corner. use the number 100 bus to get into the city centre it only takes about 3-5 minutes and runs frequently , berlin zoo only about a 10 minute walk away. would definately stay here again

<Content>Mid range hotel This hotel is well located mid way between the Zoo area of Berlin and the main centre around the Reichstad. Theres not much around the hotel, so you do have to use the 100 bus a lot but it does stop right outside. The underground wasn't practical whilst we were there as the main line into town was shut. The hotel itself didn't rate a 4 star, the service wasn't great and the bathrooms only had soap dispensers, one of which didn't work. Saying that the room looked over the central garden area which was lovely and the windows were well sound proofed making for a peaceful night. We didn't try the breakfast as it wasn't included in the price. Did go into the bar one night but it was pretty atmosphere-less - a lot of suits. Definatly a mid range hotel which is fine if you get it cheap enough.

<Content>Much better than expected After reading other reviews of this hotel which said it was located in a seedy and not so safe area of Berlin I was a bit anxious as I was a young woman travelling alone. However I am so glad I chose the Clarion as it was perfect for my stay.The hotel itself was lovely and worthy of its 4 star status. My room was clean and comfortable and I was lucky to have a view over the Lutzow Platz.The location is ideal for a weekend's sightseeing break. It is within walking distance to Tiergarten, Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, the Zoo and Aquarium and several U-bahn and S-bahn stations as well as local busses. There are a few nice restaurants nearby though it is not the best part of town for eating. There is a very nice cocktail bar in Lutzow Platz itself where I spent a lot of time. Despite seeing a couple of prostitutes in the vicinity, I felt perfectly safe. In fact the prostitutes looked rather out of place as it seemed like such a nice area!I would definitely stay in this hotel again and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to see the wonderful sights of Berlin.

<Content>Great situation, great room but awfully secruity! The hotel is magnificent and incredible service. When we arrived our room it wasnt what i asked for as it was two single beds with smoking amora and no air conditoning which i requested for double room, non smoking and air conditioning !! So i went to reception and ask if they can change to another room.. There was no problem and we got the room we truely enjoyed our stay. But i was disappointed that there was no secruity or password when you want to view some adult movie or movie. We were paid for something we didnt watched which we pressed by accident! So be careful! We paid 鈧?40 for a room for 2 nights which we thought was excellent value. Overall I would say this is one of the nicest hotel we stayed in Europe so far as the services were excellent and helpful and It was very convenient spot as we were in central of all the attractions in Berlin - bus tour just foot away from hotel.

<Content>Clarion Hotel Berlin - superb Date of stay - July 29th to Aug 2ndFrom the beginning of our stay until the minute we left the hotel staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. Our rooms were great - large and well appointed with lots of wardrobe space, great seating area and good bathroom.The hotel is situated within very easy reach of the U Bahn - a short walk down Einemstrasse and the sight seeing bus stops just across the square opposite the main entrance to the hotel. We had some excellent meals in the Lounge and the choice at breakfast was incredible.Having read other reveiws about the hotel before we travelled I can only think that the people who mentioned 'the seedy area near the hotel - with the gay district and prostitutes on the streets' were staying somewhere else and got the name of the hotel mixed up! The Clarion Hotel Berlin is excellent value for money and I would recommend it to businesses and families alike.If you are travelling with 'picky teenagers' (as we were!) I can pass on their praise for the hotel beef burgers and especially the chips - rated as 'the best they had eaten - ever'. In fact all of the meals we had were of a very high standard - so compliments to the chef and team all round.Our stay coincided with one of the hottest weekends in Berlin so the aircon was very welcome. If asked for anything that could be improved we'd be hard pushed to come up with an answer- except maybe the addition of tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Balanced against everything else this is very minor!Excellent hotel and excellent value for money.

<Content>Above Average We booked the Clarion at fairly late notice via expedia for just 拢55 for a twin bedded room. First the negative points, our room on the 4th floor had no fixed air conditioning, this meant that we either had to make use of the provided fan or open the window to the busy traffic outside. Another problem was the lack of wireless internet connection in the room, although it is generally provided as a free service throughout the hotel including in the lobby.However, it was very easy to find, park, check-in and we got to the room very quickly. The staff were very friendly and polite. The room was clean, with comfortable beds, and the location was conveniently very near a bus stop and underground stop with plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby. There was no evidence of it being in the gay distract as mentioned by another user.Mainly due to the low cost, I rate this hotel Above Average.

<Content>Not the best hotel The hotel is certainly not 4* as described in Hotels.com. It's under renovation and we requested a room facing Lutzowplatz as the rest of the hotel is facing major traffic avenues. The room was newly renovated and very clean, but the bed was awful.We experienced drilling in an adjacent room at 7:45am! It's centrally located in the gay district schoneberg, nearest U Bahn Nollendorfplatz (5 mins walk) along Einam strasse, but as you walk along einamstrasse in the evening its very seedy with prostitutes along the street. Bus 100 links the area with Zoologischergarten and alexanderplatz with convenience.Overall it's certainly isn't worth 90 euros a night as stated on the their website as the hotel is under renovation.
