<Content>Good 3 Star Hotel This is a good hotel for a 3 star European hotel. The price is reasonable, it is very clean and the service is excellent. The rooms are not particularly spacious but they are much bigger than several hotels of the same category in big European metropolitan areas. The continental breakfast is an extra bonus, it includes a variety of breads, cereal, cold cuts, cheese, eggs, yogurt, fruit salad, juices etc. For those who are looking for a cultural experience in Amsterdam and don't want to spend a lot of money in hotel, this is ideal. The hotel is located very close to the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum and the Concertgebouw. It is also easily accessible by tram or bus; but one can walk from the hotel to most touristic sites in Amsterdam.

<Content>Great Hotel Great hotel, in good location. Staff friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble, gave good information on local restaurants and bars. Room spacious, clean and well appointed and the breakfast exeeded all expectations, set us up for the day! After last years terrible experience in the Hotel Mozart, would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel This trip was taken by my husband and I (50's) for a 4 night stay, 1st time visit to Amsterdam. Having read the previous reports I had a feeling of disappointment that his was our accomodation. However, I found the Hotel exceeded my expectations.LOCATION. True it is a fair bit from the centre, but the public transport is good. We decided to walk everywhere and there is plenty to see to keep you going. We averaged 12 - 16 miles a day and had very sore feet after 3 days!!! It is near the beautiful Vondelpark, and is next to the museum and fashion quarter which houses all the upmarket designer shops ie Chanel etc. Keep walking and you will come to The Hard Rock Cafe and go a little further and you will come to lots of restaurants etc. For normal shops like H M, C A and many other recognisable names head for the streets of Dam Square. Be careful though as the Red Light District is on the other side of Dam Square, (and is well worth a visit)ACCOMODATION.The room was small but very bright and clean. The bathroom was modern. There was a fridge, a safety deposit box, a television, phone, kettle and a welcome pack of tea, coffee etc. The hairdryer was not present, there was a hole in the wall where it once hung but had been removed. This did not bother me as I took my own anyway. If I had reported it I am quite sure a satisfactory outcome would have occurrred.STAFFThe staff were all lovely, friendly and very helpful.BREAKFAST.Fantastic and well worth getting up for. Wide range and would satisfy even the fussiest of eaters! The kitchen staff were lovely. There was a variety of cereals, fruit cocktail, fresh fruit, cream bacon, scrambled egg, rolls, toast, bread, meat, cheese, fruit juices, tea and coffee, biscuits etcVALUEAs a place to stay for bed and breakfast it is certainly good value for money. However, if you buy crisps, coke, sweets etc these items are expensive. Better to go round the corner and opposite the Concert Hall to the Supermarket (not obvious you have to go down an escalator-beside a car park) where you will find things much more cheaply. At the moment as the Pound is doing so badly against the Euro we found Amsterdam very expensive.PLACES OF INTERESTThere are lots of places to go. We visited Anne Franke's House , The red light district, Dam Square,Van Gogh Musuem, The Reijksmuseum, went on a canal boat, visited Madame Tussaudsand had a quick look inside a coffee shop which was a real eye opener!!! In short lots to do and lots of places to eat and drink. The Sottish bar off the main shopping street at Dam square is the cheapest in town. Say hello to Linda from Clydeband, Allan, Ray and Eddie who likes to be known as Brian!!!!

<Content>The best place I have stayed in within Amsterdam I stayed at this hotel for my birthday with 3 other people and we were looking for a hotel that was reasonably priced within the Liedesplein/Vondelpark district. I had personally read the reviews which all appeared to be favourable and I can honestly say that in no way were we disappointed with our choice. The staff/owners were exceptionally friendly, helpful and very willing to provide maps on which they highlighted tram routes and generally where places of interest were located.  The rooms were a good size with a TV and a fridge which was for our convenience which I thought was a lovely touch. Most importantly, the bed and pillowswere superbly comfortable and whereas our room at the front of the building on the 4th floor was a little noisy with the windows open, because it had air conditioning we were able to close the windows and sleep peacefully without being too hot. Another member of our party was at the back of the building on the 1st floor which was lovely and peaceful but didn't have air con, however there was a large door/window that could be opened to allow air into the room. This basically meant that wherever you are in the building, you will have a good night's sleep!!We didn't order breakfast as it was continental and we wanted a bigger meal to set us up for the day so I cannot comment on how good/bad/value for money it is, however at the time of our visit, the pound was very weak against the euro which did make everything just that little bit more expensive than I had seen before however this isn't any reflexion on this hotel in anyway.The hotel is within a 5-10 minute walking distance of the beautiful Vondelpark which is wondeful to sit and relax in on a summer's day. There are 3 tram lines within walking distance of the hotel which are Nos 5, 16 and 24 and Leidesplein is only a couple of stops away on tram 5 however Dam Square is only about 10 minutes which meant for us, Museum Square Hotel was ideally situated.On our first night we arrived later in the evening so we opted to eat just around the corner from the hotel and we enjoyed a beautifully cooked steak with sauce, fries with a very pleasant and welcome service.For my birthday we went on a Dinner Cruise which we booked in advance through www.viator.com and cost 拢110 for 2 people but we both considered it to be worth the money once you compare the cost of this to cheaper cruises that do not serve dinner. The cruise began at 8pm so we were able to enjoy the daylight, dusk and nightfall and the beautiful colours of the red light district and lit up bridges reflected in the water during our 2.5 hour trip. The food was gorgeous and we were given complimentary glasses of sparkling wine followed by beers, wine or soft drink which were also included in the cost. If you have the money to spare and would like a romantic evening, this is definitly the way to go, however if you would like to enjoy the sights at a more reasonable cost, there are candlelit cruises for 拢22 per person that last 2 hours.I have visited Amsterdam a few times over the years but mainly in the autumn/winter and as this was my first summer trip and the sun was shining, we chose to treat ourselves and take a 30 minute horse and carriage ride around the cobbled streets which we caught from Dam Square and cost 45 euros regardless of how many people are in the carriage, as there were 4 of us, this worked out relatively cheap and was one of the highlights. You can hire them for longer (an hour) or for less but we felt 30 minutes was perfect.Overall we found the Dutch to be very friendly, helpful and with a laid back un-hurried approach that was conducive to a relaxing time despite the apparent hustle and bustle of a vibrant city. When we return again in the future, myself and the other 3 members of my group will definitly be staying at the Museum Square Hotel again.

<Content>Super value This really is a good hotel. It looks quite expensive, but first Amsterdam hotels are expensive generally and second it's worth every cent. Just as the other reviewers, I was amazed at how friendly the staff were, it feels like a real family hotel. And we got free coffee on arrival, too.The room is spacious, quiet in spite of the trams outside and clean. It's nice that the minibar is just a fridge for stuff you buy yourself (and of course you're told where to buy stuff the minute you just think of it) and not a load of overpriced drinks you don't want.It's not smack in the centre, but that's probably a good thing. The Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum are just ten minutes' walk away, and Leidseplein (for the nightlife and restaurants) only twenty, and of course you can take the tram. The neighbourhood is nice and quiet, with more than a few cafes and a convenience store: look for the AH logo near the entrance to the underground parking on van Baerlestraat near the Van Gogh Museum. For shoppers, PC Hooftstraat is just ten minutes' walk away.Transportation tips: if this is your first time in Amsterdam, your best bet from Schiphol is the airport shuttle minibus: look for the green Connexxion shuttle and ask the driver where to buy tickets. If you feel comfortable with Amsterdam's public transport, it is faster (and much cheaper) to take the train to Amsterdam-Zuid (there are loads) and then tram 5 to Concertgebouw, rather than going all the way to the Central Station.

<Content>queens day at museum square we stayed at this hotel,unknowingly when we booked it over the holiday of queens day ,30th april,so it was all rather different in Amsterdam to what we were expecting. The hotel was quite a walk from the centre but there are trams from a nearby stop(not on Queens day so we walked and walked). The reception staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, actually all the Dutch people were during our stay.its easy to catch a bus from the airport which stops almost outside the hotel and only takes about 25mins. The breakfasts were adequate.but nothing special.There is a fridge in the rooms that you can use for your own purchases eg milk. There is only a shower in the bathrooms and we had twin beds despite booking a double. Everywhere was kept clean although I agree with some others that it needs some refurbishment in decor and carpets in public places.Overall a pleasant stay and good value.

<Content>Very friendly, good location, could use a refresh I just returned from five nights in Amsterdam, four of which I spent at the Museum Square Hotel. The location is great. It's right on a tram line (#16) and practically next door to a number of museums, including the Rijksmuseum and the VanGogh, both of which were great. The front desk staff was very friendly and helped me figure out how to buy and use passes for the tram  bus. The neighborhood has a number of sidewalk cafes and good restaurants to select from and is away from the chaos of Dam Square. The main drawback to this property is that it needs to be remodeled. It just feels tired.

<Content>Hotel and staff brilliant Having read all the reviews online before we went to Amsterdam of the Museum Square Hotel I could not believe it could be as good as was stated. However, from the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome, it was lovely to be given coffee on our arrival as we had been travelling since early morning and our room was made up immediately even though we should not have booked in until later.The breakfast was very adequate and the rooms were airy and comfortable. The hotel was convenient for most places and had public transport nearby.The staff were amazing and very friendly and helpful. One of the best hotels we have stayed in, in the price range. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>This hotel is an absolute gem! This little hotel is an absolute gem! My husband and I spent 7 nights here the first week in April and were delighted by every aspect of our stay. The room was charming and along with the bathroom spotlessly clean. The very comfy beds are made with pristine white duvets and shams without the usual suspiciously unlaundered bedspreads of most hotels. What a plus! Fridge and electric tea kettle with coffee and tea and china cups and saucers in the room made evenings extremely pleasant. The location is perfect if your main interests are the Van Gogh Museum and the Rijksmuseum, just a 5 minute walk, but all the trams stop nearby, so nothing is really far away. And, the famed Concertgebouw is right on the corner! Breakfast was included with our room and we really enjoyed the convenience and variety in the lovely breakfast room each morning. The staff in this hotel go above and beyond the call of duty! Roel and Lisan are amazing. We took many day trips by train, and they always had train schedules and tram numbers ready for us. Book here with confidence! We'll be back again soon for sure.

<Content>A pleasant hotel in Amsterdam Museum Square is a low key and simple hotel with an AMAZING staff! Prior to my family's arrival, Roel and his patient and friendly team provided us with a lot of help and information regarding our rooms and the city. With their help, we were able to get our Anne Frank tickets printed, as well as our trip to Keukenhof Gardens arranged and booked. My 10-year-old brother loved the playground next door, as well Vondel Park and the museum park square. The hotel (with its lift and accessible shower room) was very accommodating for my mom, who has a knee disability. The trams nearby stop at the most convenient locations, such as the Central Station and Dam Square. The neighborhood isn't as picturesque as other hotel locations (it's a good ten minute walk to the canals), but there are markets, eateries and cafes nearby. As for our room, it was modern, clean, and comfortable, though the street/tram/traffic noise could be quite loud at times. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Great little Amsterdam hotel My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel during our first trip to Amsterdam. I used Trip Advisor to find recommendations, of course, and I was not disappointed. Although the hotel is not a big, fancy hotel, we found the accommodations to be pleasant. It was very clean, the reception staff was very helpful and the location was convenient. The hotel is not located in the center of town - but it only take about 10 minutes to walk there, or 5 by tram - so it's relatively quiet at night. A nice place to call home during our short stay. I would definitely return.

<Content>Amazing staff and a Great Hotel This hotel is located in the heart of the Museum district. It is close shopping and trams that will take you anywhere you want to go. The longest tram ride was 15 minutes. The rooms are large and clean. The buffet breakfast was excellent and included in the price of the room. This hotel is a great value for the price.However, what makes this hotel exceptional is the staff. We were 6 couples and were greated by Lissan at the front desk. She got us into our rooms quickly and was very helpful with hint and information about Amsterdam. During our stay my wife became ill and we were unable to leave for our next location. The hotel was booked solid as were just about every other hotel in Amsterdam. The manager, Roel, contacted a doctor to come a treat my wife. He helped us change our airline reservation and after about 2 hours of intense telephone calls he was able to find a room in a hotel nearby at a reasonable price. He didn't stop there, he was able to convince one of his steady customers, that was due to arrive that day, to go to the other hotel so that my wife wouldn't have to move. While I was out getting a prescription filled he check to make sure she was okay. When we go back to Amsterdam we would not consider staying anywhere else and would recommend it highly.John and Antoinette C

<Content>Brill stay at Museum square Just back from a stay at the museum square, we were there for 4 days and found the Hotel an absolute joy! The staff were friendly and informative, even making us breakfast in time for our 6.30am check out! The room was very spacious and had access to a terrace, would be lovely during the summer. When booking the hotel I was under the assumption it was within walking distance from Dam Square, whilst it was prob 30 mins it wasn't exactly ideal for Blustery March Weather. However I wouldn't let this put you off a stay at the Museum Square, as it makes an enjoyable visit to Amsterdam, even better! P.s, Great breakfasts!

<Content>Had a nice stay at the Museum Square The hotel is located close to the Concertgebouw and the beautiful Museum Square. If the weather is good, the walk up to Leidse Plein, across the museum square, past the rijksmuseum, is a great way to start the day.There is an Albert Heijn supermarket close by, at the edge of Museum Square.It is a small but decent hotel, I spent quite some time there, as I became ill during my vacation (isn't it typical...). The staff were helpful and kind (and offered to help me get a doctor if I needed one), the beds were good and everything worked as it should.We had large windows to the street, which means noise but also a view of Amsterdam buildings, which I enjoyed.One slightly weird detail though: There was a large button for turning the light on and off, on the wall, right above one of the pillow places, on the bed-frame. If you sit up in bed, lean your back against the wall and want to watch TV, for instance, there is no way of NOT accidentally turning the light on and off every time you move your back the tiniest bit. Getting there and back from the airport is really easy, the bus 370, and the much more frequent 197, stop at the bus stop almost right in front of the hotel.

<Content>lovely, quiet, reasonably priced hotel This is a lovely small hotel with a very friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are light and airy, the beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are spotless and modern. It's in the museum district, a short tram ride to the city centre and a five minute walk to the major museums. Ask for a room in the back, which is exceptionally quiet. It is very reasonable and I highly recommend it.

<Content>Great hotel Four of us stayed in the Museum Square hotel for 2 nights in February and had a great experience. The rooms are very comfortable, warm and spacious and very clean. The bathrooms are a good size and the beds really comfy. The location is near the museums which is a great area as it's not full of rowdy tourists or stag parties. The Van Gogh museum is about a 5 minute walk away as is the tram stop. You can walk to the Liedesplein in 15 minutes so very well placed. The breakfast was good with lots of choice. The reception was very helpful too - really could not fault the experience and will definately be returning!

<Content>Great Place! Great Location! I didn't know what to expect based on some of the reviews of the hotel, but let me tell you...this place is great. The staff (and I don't know their names) where kind and friendly and they helped me practice my limited Dutch. The hotel is situated in the Museumplein area of Oud Zuid. Two tram lines are within 5 minutes of the hotel. My room was on the street side and there was no noise problem. Don't get hung up on breakfast as it is traditionally Dutch (cold cuts, bread etc.). I will definitely stay there again when I return to Amsterdam.

<Content>a complete pleasure Booked this hotel on a website I didn't know, so I was nervous when I arrived, but it was lovely. Stayed two nights, and wish I could have stayed longer. The room was quiet, and quite nice, with garden access through a sliding door in the room [I had a ground floor room, which I usually don't like]. Hotel staff was completely helpful and there were two streetcar routes available within a short two block walk. A very quiet neighborhood, felt very safe, but within easy walking distance of museums, restaurants, cafes and the red light district. Please note that the hotel does not allow the use of drugs in its rooms or on hotel grounds.

<Content>Wonderful place to stay I loved this hotel. The room was spacious, clean, had all the facilities you need, and the staff were wonderfully helpful and pleasant. I travelled with a good friend who definitely agreed with me.The building is situated slightly out of the main centre of Amsterdam, near the museum district, and a short walk to the theatres. If you like walking, which we did, you are more than able to walk into the Town, or if not, then the tram and bus run from just outside the hotel.The breakfast is not as wide a spread as you would maybe get in larger hotels, but the food they have out is lovely, and there's plenty of it. In the foyer they provide lots of little tourist cards with various offers and money off at different sights around the city, it's worth checking them out.I had a very enjoyable stay in the Museum Square Hotel, and would definitely go back.

<Content>Great finding! I stayed in the MSH for two nights, and I really enjoyed it. My room was huge, with a big window, lots of light. Although it is not in the city center, the location is perfect, because you can walk everywhere. To give you an idea, the Van Gogh museum is just two blocks away, the fashion district 300 metres. The breakfast is abundant, and there is a supermarket in the Museumplein and several restaurants and take aways in the neighbourhood.

<Content>Really Great Little Hotel Our room was on the 4th floor, right at the top of the hotel (but there is a lift) and it was larger than I was expecting. We had a lovey view out of the window to the street below. The room was clean and spacious, with three beds, small fridge, a very good selection of tea and coffees (good choice and quantity), and all the other amenities that were advertised. There was noise from the street below, but once the windows were shut, it was gone. There was also a/c available, but we never used it. On the coffee table in the room was also a couple of tourist books and guides which we did enjoy looking through.The breakfast was typical of hotels in Amsterdam, bread rolls, croissants, sliced bread, slices of ham, cheese, salami, cereals, juices, chocolate milk, fruit, hard boiled eggs and a selection of jams and spreads. It was all served in the conservatory at the back of the building which was clean, tidy and generally lovely. We did want to go into the bar one evening, but found out it had not been open for a couple of years, which I think is a shame, as it looks very nice, but instead we decided to get a couple of drinks from reception and take them to our room as they do offer some drinks and snacks at reception. However the lovely lady on reception said we would be really overcharged and instead suggested a local supermarket, which we would never have found without help, and turned out to be a real find!The location was great, close to a lovely park between the Rijksmuseum and the Concert Hall. About a 10 minute walk to the Leidesplein, for lots of restaurants and shops and then a further 10/15 minutes walk to the red light district, dam square and the area near the train station.The Hotel staff could not do enough for us, they were always ready to give directions, suggest places to go and they always asked if we'd had a good day on our way in and wished us an 'enjoy your evening' on our way out. They even knew our room number before asking after just one day. Not sure if that was good thing or a bad thing!I really enjoyed this hotel and thought it was excellent. We stayed for 3 nights in September 2007, and will happily go back there.

<Content>Great location! This hotel is very well located and is only a 2 mintues walk to multiple tram stops. It is in walking distance to the concert hall, Van Gogh Museum and multiple other sites. It was also close to a major grocery store and a wonderful bakery! At my request, they gave me a room off the back of the hotel away from the stree and the elevator.I stayed at this hotel as part of a conference room block. Positives were the friendly front desk staff, nice size single room with mini bar size refrig, large in-room safe, and adequate closet and storage space. Breakfast included no hot foods but there was a section of meats and cheeses as well as cereal and fruit cocktail. There was a toaster for the bread.The taxi they arranged to take me to the airport at 4:30am was right on time but the hotel wake up call was 25 minutes late. Internet access fee and wireless fees were both quite high.

<Content>Lovely location and excellent staff We stayed here for 2 nights over the convention period. The hotel rooms were a good size and location ideal for us. The breakfast was more than adequate and plentiful and the conservatory was really nice. The staff are excellent here and are happy to give any information required. Although the price seemed a little steep for what it was (possibly due to convention week), I would stay here again, although I would probably ask for a room at the back of the hotel as the noice from the road at the front was quite noticeable.

<Content>Four delightful nights This is not the Ritz -- and it doesn't pretend to be. Still, this is the place to stay if you are looking for a pleasant, unpretentious yet convenient hotel in a quiet, safe neighborhood. The rooms are large by European standards and some are even air-conditioned (but you can't get a/c and non-smoking in the same room). The front-desk staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean (though they could stand some refurbishing) and the beds were quite comfortable.Though non-smokers, we chose the rooms with the a/c for our August stay (and used the a/c even though temps were in the low 70s by day). We stayed in two different rooms and neither of them smelled of stale smoke. Our first room faced the back of the hotel; from the 4th floor (5th by American reckoning), you could see the neighborhood rooftops. Our second room faced the street, from where you could see both the Concertgebouw and the Rijksmuseum. The street-side is a bit noisy with the windows open but the double-glazed windows block out most of the noise (and the neighborhood does quiet down at night). Although the guidebooks complain about the lack of restaurants in the Museum Square area, we didn't know what they were talking about. We walked around the corner from the hotel on our first night and found 5 or 6 places to choose from--again, nothing fancy, just the local eateries. The breakfast was a typical Dutch offering -- breads (and a toaster), cold-cuts (yes; ham, cheese, salami, turkey), cold cereal, soft-boiled eggs, some fruit. Yes, we will stay at the Museum Square Hotel again and we will suggest it ti friends as well.

<Content>Friendly Hotel We stayed here with our teenage son for 4 nights, the staff are very friendly and helpful and the room was big, bright and clean. Shower was awful, either scalding hot or a cool trickle. Breakfast was ok. Situated in a nice neighbourhood and very well located for Museums etc but quite a walk into town for nightlife restaurants etc. Also found it noisy at night as our room was facing the main road. Also the hotel bar never seemed to be open. Would stay a bit further into town next time.

<Content>Lovely location, lovely staff! My wife, my stepson and myself stayed here for three happy days in August. The location is very convenient for the concert hall and the main museums, but it isn't really smack in the middle of the city. This is not a problem, however, if you can master the tram system. Walking to the Dam Square takes about 25 minutes if you walk briskly, considerably more if you dawdle and take in the sights and shops. Either way it's as flat as a pancake, of course!My stepson's room was a comfortable double with air con. Our's was a twin on the floor below. Both rooms were at the back of the hotel and therefore quieter. Rooms on the front could be noisy I guess. If it's hot--and it was for our first night--a room with air con is a must. Our twin didn't have it and we 'cooked' as a result. Unusually for a continental hotel the rooms had tea and coffee making facilities and a small fridge.Breakfast was the usual Dutch buffet: ideal for 'stoking' up for the day ahead.All of the staff were friendly and, of course, multi lingual.The hotel is in a nice neighbourhood with plenty of good eating and drinking options.This is somewhere we'd definitely consider using again when ( not if ) we go back to this great city.

<Content>No surprises This hotel suited our needs just fine. We chose the hotel primarily because we wanted to stay in the area, and this hotel was moderately priced (the big chain hotels costed more than twice the price we paid) and one of very few hotels in Amsterdam that offers triple rooms.The room was spacious and clean, the bathroom clean with good water pressure in the shower.The only minor issue was that the cups weren't changed once during our 5 nights stay, so we had to wash them ourselves, a little irritating, but not a big issue.Breakfast was more than adequate, and there was never any queing as is common in bigger hotels.All in all a positive experience, and I wouldn't hesitate to book there again.

<Content>Great Hotel, Excellent Value I had an overall great stay at the Museum Square Hotel. Both my room and bathroom were quite large. I stayed in the room alone, but considering that the bed was a queen, the hotel must use the room for couples. Even for couples it was very large. Much larger than what's standard in European 3 star hotels.Everything was very clean. Staff was friendly and helpful.The breakfast was quite good -- American continental: eggs, cereal, croissant, OJ, etc.The hotel is situated very close to some of the tourist hot spots: The Concertgebouw is across the street, and the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum are less than a five minute walk away (I imagine that almost everyone who visits Amsterdam goes to both of these fantastic museums).One thing I do need to mention about the hotel is that it's on the outskirts of the city center -- the heart of the city is about a 15 to 20 minute walk away; the train station is closer to 30. However, trams and buses stop in front of the hotel which will take you downtown. I found that being outside of the city center was a plus. The hotel is located on the edge of a tranquil residential neighborhood which have many good and reasonably priced restaurants. I really enjoyed just walking around the neighborhood and seeing what life in Amsterdam looks like.And finally, the price was very low.Next time I go to Amsterdam I will definitely stay at the Museum Square Hotel again. (I have recommended the hotel to friends who tried to book rooms five months ahead of time only to find it completely sold out -- I guess I'm not the only one who had a great stay).

<Content>fabulous place to stay We stayed here for 2 nights over half term with our 3 year old. The staff were fantastic and very helpful. They explained maps, told us how to get to the Miffy shop ( the only reason our daughter wanted to go to Amsterdam) and gave us a card with the hotel number for her to keep in her pocket in case she got lost. The room was a good size and very clean. The breakfasts were good. Nothing exciting, but fresh, decent food and no queues.All the hotel staff spoke good English and were happy to book airport buses for us.The location is great as it is just off Museumplienn - the main square where the Van Gogh Museum and the Concert hall are. There are lots of trams from here to the city centre or anywhere else! It is easy to wlak into the city centre as well, it would take about 15/20 min.We would not hesitate to use this hotel again.

<Content>Great hotel This was my third trip to Amsterdam and the first time I had stayed in this hotel. Found the experience to be truly excellent. Rooms were spacious and extremely clean (not always a priority in Holland) and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. The front desk contributed to the enjoyment of our stay, being both informative and courteous. One guy in particular was a real character - very eccentric but with a great manner.The hotel is situated close to a number of excellent attractions, not least of which the Rijksmuseum and the casino. The latter is maybe a 10-minute walk away but well worth it, open to 3am every night. We spent most of our time in Leidsplein which I found much more appealing than Dam Square where the atmosphere seemed a little more leery and noisy. Overall I'd recommend the hotel to anyone, superb level of service at a very reasonable rate.

<Content>Pretty good value I arrived the hotel at about 10.30am and the only available room was a smoking room but I was allowed to go up and have a look at it first. It turned out to be pretty spacious with a small balcony and surprisingly didn't smell of smoke at all!We requested for a twin room but I have to say that the beds we were given were definitely much smaller than a single bed! It was almost like a double bed cut in half. But the beds were really comfortable so I guess that made up for it's lack of width.The hotel is situated almost opposite the concert hall and just a five minute walk away from the Van Gogh museum and the Rijksmuseum. The trams are frequent and reliable so it is pretty easy to get around.Breakfast was served in a pleasant room on the ground floor. There wasn't a great choice of food though.While the two guys at the reception were friendly and helpful, I thought the lady was so rude!! I'd requested for an airport shuttle to come at 11.45am but she insisted that I should leave at 11.15am so I let her arrange for it at 11.15am. The next morning however, I'd lost track of time and returned to the hotel at 11.25am. When I asked her if I'd missed the shuttle, she replied very rudely:' What do you think.' I was too taken aback to say anything. That incident really ruined my entire trip.

<Content>Great Location, Clean, Would recommend for weekend break Spent last weekend in Amsterdam in this hotel and found it excellent.The outside is very basic looking however although an older hotel it is very clean, staff are very friendly and helpful and breakfast was good continential style. Rooms have kettle, TV with movie channels and our room was a good size. Beds very comfortable, good shower and big window so great sunlight getting in. Our Room was to the front of the hotel and we had no problem with noise. From the airport we got bus number 370 Interliner at stand B5 and it cost 鈧?.30 and this dropped us off just outside the hotel (at Museum Square). The bus back to airport was also very close to hotel and it runs every 30 mins but if travelling early in morning check timetable. Everywhere is walking distance from this hotel, bring comfortable shoes. Next time I am in Amserdam we will stay here.

<Content>Great location, dirty room Good: location, in the center of Amsterdam, could even park in front of the hotel (don't have to pay for it between midnight and 9am...after 9am it's almost unaffordable).Bad: the room (101, first room on the 2nd floor) was not worth the 130+ Euro we paid for it. One of the pillows was dirty (make up, they gave us a new one immediately), the curtains were extremely dirty and there were countless stains on the carpet from painting the ceiling (I guess). Okay: bathroom, breakfast (no scrambled eggs)Would not stay there again.

<Content>Superb! Decor is old - yes. But the rooms are so spacious, location is superb and breakfast is simply too good that you forget about the decor.Staff is very friendly and on our last day we kept our luggage there and went sightseeing. If you're taking a tram from the train station (centraal) - stop at concertgebouw. It's a 3-4 minute walk from there although it took us ages to find it as we were walking in the wrong direction!PS: Breakfast in that big room is excellent.

Great Hotel; excellent - staff, Breakfast, room size and room layout. Can't recommend it enough.Booked the return taxi to the airport only 30Euros and well worth it.

<Content>Pleasant and Convenient We have just returned from a four night stay, and found this to be a nice, pleasant, inexpensive hotel in a very convenient location.The first day we found that we were able to walk everywhere throughout Central Amsterdam without using public transport.I agree with the majority of the other favourable reviews, and am very happy to recommend the hotel to others.To reach the Hotel from Schipol, we got the the 370 bus ( an Interliner) from stand B4 ( I think but possibly B5) just outside the arrivals hall. The bus is every half hour, costs 3.2 euro and drops you off at the Concertgebouw just outside the hotel.Very cheap, quick and convenient.

<Content>helpful  We have just returned from a four night stay at the Museum square hotel in Amsterdam. The hotel is approximately 2 minutes walk from the concert hall and 5-6 minutes walk from museumplein and there are regular trams into the centre of the city (trams 5  16 - will also take you to central station). We were looking for a hotel that was not near the main tourist area, but was within easy reach and this certainly fitted the bill!The staff at the reception desk and in the breakfast room were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. When we were leaving the owner, receptionist and waiter all shoke our hands!The room was large and clean, however, the whole hotel was a little tired looking and in need of redecoration. Our room looked out onto the street and whilst it wasn't a particularly busy road there were frequent buses and trams going by throughout the night. Perhaps not a good choice of hotel if you are a particularly light sleeper!All in all, the hotel was a good choice for location, price and staff.For things to do in Amsterdam I can recommend a night-time canal cruise, Van Gogh museum, flowermarket, canalboat museum  pancake house, both on Prinsengracht and waterlooplien market.
