<Content>Great We had a very nice stay. The room was (executive suite) spacious and modern. The gym, pool, hot tub and sauna were all nice. The breakfast buffet was a real nice add on. The staff was friendly. It was a bit of a walk to the White House especially considering the wind, but it was not terrible. I found the hotel very kid friendly and highly recommend it.

<Content>great place for family Great place for family to stay in DC. My kids loved feeding the fish, the pool, the afternoon snacks... Breakfast was very good, although a little crowded. Beds were really nice -- one of the best hotel beds I've seen. The rooms and pool were clean. We really recommend this hotel for a family trip!

<Content>Friendly Staff, Updated decor, Good location! Our family of 4 just returned from a long weekend at this Embassy Suites in Wash. DC. It was our first visit to this hotel and we were very pleased. I had selected it based on past tripadvisor reviews and we were not disappointed at all. This hotel is a very friendly and active place -- all the staff we came in contact with had super attitudes and were very helpful. They take pride in their work and it shows. We had a regular room -- all are Suites - which include one bedroom and a sitting room. The whole place was very clean and had fresh, updated decor -- including fashionable bedcoverings, curtains and furniture. There was a large flatscreen television in the living room portion of the suite plus a sofa (which could convert to sofabed), chair and a small kitchen table with 4 chairs. There was also a small sink in the living room and a small refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, iron/ironing board, and private small safe for valuables. The bedroom contained 2 Queen beds which were very comfortable and had particularly soft sheets, blankets and bedspreads. All the linens looked brand new. The bathroom was large with a long counter, hair dryer, lots of towels of various sizes and a tub and shower combo with massage shower head. It was also clean and in good condition. The hotel has a small gym which my husband went to several times and said was adequate for his needs. It was often busy but there was never a time when the gym looked overcrowded or anyone was waiting for a machine. The gym equipment was also updated and in good working condition, along with flat screen TVs to keep you occupied while you were exercising. There was a small indoor pool off of the gym area but when we were there is was chock full of young children doing cannonballs and splashing -- a little too loud and rowdy for our tastes. But, I guess this is sue to the fact that we visited at a time that kids are out of school due to the Winter Break. I don't think that the pool experience would be one I would recommend to any adult who doesn't have young children. If you do have young kids, though -- this is a good place to let them burn off some steam. (Better in the pool area than the Atrium at the breakfast buffet!.....more on that later!)The breakfast buffet was a highlight of the hotel. I had read previous reviews and took their advice into account when I chose the first time our family visited the buffet. The first time we came early as suggested and it was a very pleasant experience. At 7:15 am it was not crowded and it was very calm and relaxing. They have large screen televisions with CNN morning shows on throughout the atrium and also provide complimentary newspapers. The Embassy Suites DC breakfast buffet was really very varied and included many hot and cold items...certainly something for everyone. It was one of the best hotel buffets that I have seen -- and our family travels frequently.There was an Omelette Station which consisted of a very friendly chef asking you which fillings you would like (spinach, bacon, tomato, sausage, onion, cheese, pepper, etc...) and he prepares it fresh right in front of you. Very tasty. There is also a Make Your Own Waffle station which had 4 or 5 machines where you could pour your own batter into a waffle machine and in 2 minutes you'd have a crispy waffle to eat. There was also a standard buffet set up of chafing dishes that included scrambled eggs, pancakes, sausage links, bacon, homefried potatoes and oatmeal. There was a large tray of assorted Yoplait yogurts and a large bowl of diced melon, plus individual fruits like whole bananas and oranges. They also had a selection of muffins, bread and bagels (and toasters for them). There was a large selection of breakfast cereals, mostly kid-friendly stuff like fruit loops, Frosted flakes, etc. -- all popular name brands. Big selection in the beverage department --- Coffees were from Starbucks and included several different flavors (decaf  regular) as well as hot chocolate. They also had various choices of milk and hot teas. They had self serve soda fountains which included all the major flavors (coke, diet coke, sprite, etc), plus juice machines which included orange, apple, fruit punch and cranberry. The only problem we encountered with the breakfast buffet had to do with the timing of our 2nd visit (which I had been warned about from past tripadvisor reviews!). If you visit the buffet anytime after, say 8:30 on, you are in for a different experience. The place is VERY crowded then and there are often not enough seats for everyone, plus, at least during our visit, there was a large volume of unattended young children. This is not really any fault of the hotel, of course, -- but the fault of inattentive parents who probably just assume that their children are safe within an enclosed area so they let them run free....(hence, the problem). Our children are 8 and 10, so they are past the constant running stage -- that age from about 3 - 5 when toddlers, (especially boys!) are in perpetual motion. The problem with this situation was that there was such a high density of people in a small area. Adults were trying to carry heavy trays of hot food and steaming coffee through crowded, tight spaces and little ones, oblivious to the dangers overhead, were running in and out and weaving around their legs, Of course, this behavior is just part of what being a kid is all about, but this is just not the place for it due to the safety issues. Watching a well dressed businessman who is not in the mindset of having to be wary of a 3 foot high obstacle coming at his knees at high speed was something to see! You could just see that there were a whole mix of ages in one place and that the older people without children were dumbfounded that some very young children were left unsupervised (with the possibility of getting hurt due to an accident) or that young elementary age children were going up to the hot waffle makers alone to cook their own food. One specific incident that stands out in my mind was when our family was trying to get down into the breakfast area and we were walking down the ramps that lead into the space. We came across a young boy (maybe 4 years old) dressed in red footed pajamas laying on his side and rolling himself the length of the ramp (kind of like a human swiffer, if you will) People had to carefully tip toe around him so as not to step on him! At different times throughout our 20 minutes at breakfast I looked back over to where the boy was rolling and, sure enough, he was still there...spinning away like a bowling ball through a crowd of human pins. STRIKE! One of the biggest compliments in my review has has to go to the hotel staff at the breakfast buffet -- They were all very pleasant and, since they were all very busy, they should be commended for being so upbeat in the midst of all this activity. I even saw an award hanging up in the cooking area of the Omelette Station noting an excellent achievement the breakfast team received recently. It is certainly well deserved. Any time I interacted with them they were all smiles -- I also saw them cleaning up many a spill or a splatter with happy faces and positive comments to other guests. I was impressed with their excellent attitudes - and somewhat in awe that they could deal with this barely organized chaos day after day! So, all in all -- an excellent stay at this very busy, active, and updated hotel in the center of DC action. You won't be disappointed here....just remember to get up and eat your breakfast early! HAPPY TRAVELS!

<Content>Great stay, would highly recommend Just returned from a lovely one night stay at the Embassy Suites.Took the train from our home in VA to attend an evening performance at the Kennedy Center. Easy metro trip from Union Station-then about a four block walk from the Dupont Circle stop through a nice neighborhood of upscale townhomes and apartments.. Two room suite spotless and spacious with wet bar, small fridge, microwave, coffee maker with tea and coffee selections. Enjoyed complimentary cocktails at manager's reception prior to delicious dinner in Nicola's- their on site Italian restaurant. When we told them we had limited time for dinner as we needed to get to the Kennedy Center, they could not have been more accommodating, suggesting entrees that took less time to prepare. We were out in plenty of time, and bellman got us a cab when we were ready -$6.50 each way.  We enjoyed a quiet and comfortable night's sleep. Individual temperature controls for each suite worked well.Extensive breakfast buffet with an omlet station the next morning was a bit crowded with families, but this was a holiday weekend, and we chose probably the busiest time to eat-around 9 am. But tables were cleared promptly and we had no difficulty finding a place to sit-there is lots of room. We stored our luggage at the hotel while we visited some museums prior to our early evening departure on the train-we will definitely stay here again on our next visit to DC.

<Content>Great place near DuPont Circle Great hotel near DuPont Circle. Beautiful large rooms. Front desk was very helpful and polite. The only downfall is the price to pay to park. After taxes and all it comes to about $30.00/day. I guess that is standard for a major city but seems very pricey to me. I would definately stay there again. Great location.

<Content>Wonderful experience, amazing staff Wow, what a great experience! My sister and I stayed at the Embassy Suites in downtown DC in August 2008. Not expecting the Southern hospitality of my hometown, I was quite surprised to find a little bit of home while there. The staff was courteous, helpful, and welcoming, The breakfast and afternoon managers reception was such a treat. The hotel was beautiful and very clean. I loved the beds! I had no idea I could sleep so well away from home. The waterfall and lobby were just lovely!I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit the DC area for fun or business. It's location is central to many of the main attractions. But most importantly, the staff completes the experience by making everyone feel so welcomed!

<Content>Great Hotel My son and I stayed here on a weekend trip to DC. We were here about 6 months after it was built. The place was beautiful and very clean.The room was very nice. We had a flat screen in the living room and another TV in the bedroom. The pullout bed in the living room was much better than other hotels I've stayed in. It wasn't fantastic but I didn't hurt my back like those torture devices always do.The hotel is in a good location and within walking distance of many of the museums.

<Content>Excellent Hotel  I stayed at the property the weekend of Dec. 12th. When I entered the hotel, I was amazed at he beauty of the property. The staff was welcoming and helpful. They made sure both of my rooms were placed next door to each other. The rooms themselves were great! Plenty of space and very clean. Love the HD TV in the living room. And finally, I LOVED the breakfast! Food was good and I loved the make your own waffle station (I'm a nut for a good waffle). Overall, excellent choice for the money and great location in DC. Will be coming back soon with the family.

<Content>Really average service Really ordinary service. Not able to place any call from the room (local-long distance), nobody could help up (in 2 different rooms). Breakfast is great. Rooms are big. Location is Okay in DC. Last year, stayed the Sheraton Four Points for 110 USD, was a better deal than Embassy Suites DC on 22nd.

<Content>Bedbugs I stayed at this location of the Embassy Suites for 5 weeks, Oct-Nov. 2008. I kept waking up to bites but, despite searching the bed, couldn't find anything. After 2 weeks, I began to awaken with blood spots on my sheets. While housekeeping was quick to replace the sheets, the front desk refused to believe me that there might be bedbugs in my room. Two days before I left, I found actual bugs. I put them in a ziploc baggy and left them in the room when I checked-out.This hotel DEFINATELY has bed bugs.I'm praying that I didn't bring any home with me...

<Content>This place ROCKS!!!! This hotel is fabulous!! We got the tip about it from Trip advisor and we are thrilled at the quality for the price we paid.The hotel is located near the Georgetown section very close to the Metro (4 blocks) It was a very safe area. We took the Metro to all of the spots. I suggest you buy a multiday metro pass and avoid the Taxi's which are very expensive.We took the Amtrak train from Ny and were pleasently surp[rised when the taxi pulled up to this hotel.The lobby is stunning! There is a cool waterfall and lots of foliage,Lovely!The front desk people were super friendly and asked why we were in DC. We told them it was our anniversary and that we had never been to DC.They provided us with maps and suggestions as well as directions.The room was on the 7th floor and was very nice. It is an all suite hotel. The front room was the living area with a sofa,chair,coffee table and nice flat screen tv. There was also a nice table and chairs for quick meals.The bathroom was very clean and spacious. Nice comfy towels!The bedroom was gorgous-King bed, nice furniture and another flat screen.The hotel offers a hot otch free breakfast- they had an omelet chef as well as tons of choices. Go early as it fills up quick!The second day we came back to our room for some rest and found the staff left us a bottle of wine and a card signed by the whole staff for our anniversary. They also included a complimentary book on DC from the gift shop in the lobby.The pool/hot tub was very nice as well and we relaxed every night after a long day of walking!the MOST impressive thing we found was the free managers reception every night. They comp free alcohol and munchies.We were there during the VP debate /World series and they had flat screens set up in the dining area. We both had 3-4 STRONG drinks and munchies.There is also a good restaraunt in the hotel where we ate the first night.We also got some light snacks delivered from room service one night-YUM!Overall-this was an awesome hotel and I now look for Embassy Suites whenever we travel!

<Content>Great Stay at the Embassy Suites The hotel is your typical Embassy Suites. Nice large rooms, each with an LG flat screen TV. Very comfortable beds with lots of pillows to choose from. The atrium of the hotel was very nicely done. Plenty of tables to sit at for the nightly manager's reception or the daily made to order breakfast. The drinks at the reception were very good. The bartender definitely did not go light on the alcohol! Snacks varied from chips and salsa to veggies and dip with the always present popcorn. The breakfasts were very good. Plenty to choose from. The omelets were very good as was the bacon and the variety of fruit and yogurts. Staff was very friendly. I wasn't really thrilled with the food from room service. Had the roast chicken, which was dry and the broccoli was kind of wierd tasting as were the mashed potatos. Usually, I don't order from room service, but it was late and I was hungry. I very quickly remembered why I don't usually order room service. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Right off of DuPont Circle.  All in all a very nice stay in a very nice hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel - Would Definitely Stay Again!! We stayed one night at this hotel and would definitely stay there again. It is in a great location, near Dupont Circle and is an easy walk to many restaurants and neighborhood coffee houses. The underground parking garage is very convenient, the staff was extremely helpful and the room itself was emaculate and posh. The room was a suite which included a living room area, bar area with separate sink, large batthroom and large bedroom. The decor was beautiful and contemporary. Some of the amenities in the room were a microwave, small refrigerator and of course a coffee pot. Not having any kids, we noticed it had a lot of families staying there. It was also very difficult to take advantage of the free buffet breakfast - very long lines. So, we recommend getting up very early to get the breakfast in a timely manner. We would definitely go back there, however. Great place!!

<Content>Great hotel...really nice pool for the kids We took our two children (ages 4 and 3 - boy and girl) here for a long week-end to see the sites in September 2008.We loved the hotel. The room was clean, nice view and large enough for all 4 of us. It does not have kitchen. Just a sink and a small fridge. It does have a separate bedroom and a pull-out bed in the livingroom.It has a good seafood restaurant with a bar...and they use restaurant for brunch which was included with our room. The restaurant is not the greatest in that I would not compare it with what you can find walking around the city, but it is more than adequate if you do not feel like going out. We thought the brunch was great. Lots to eat for the kids, etc..The pool is a lap pool and, as such, very shallow. My 4 year old litererally taught himself how to swim.Only complaint is that it could be little closer to the Mall, but if you are a good walker, it is not far. With little kids, we could not walk very far, and used taxis.

<Content>Exceeded expectations The host hotel for my conference couldn't accommodate us for the duration of our stay so we were happy to find this hotel close by. Not only do the suites make life easier (separate bedrooom so if one of us wants to go to bed early or get up early, there's additional space to hang out), there's an extra sink outside of the bathroom, there's two TVs and lots of outlets for electronics. Best parts though were the included hot breakfast buffet (made to order omelettes, waffles, etc), but the manager's evening reception which was any well drink, draft beer or specialty drink they could concoct -- especially friendly staff, snacks that were different each night (veggies and rip, chips, pretzels, nachos w/jalapenos and cheese) and the opportunity to feed the koi (if so inclined). OK, yes, it's a chain and had that kind of Holiday Inn feel with the big atrium and waterfalls and generic room furniture, but the rooms were clean, fairly modern, quiet and again, the staff were especially friendly and unobtrusive. For the money and great location (close to Dupont Circle), I wouldn't trade it for something more typical DC.

<Content>Great family accommodation This ranks as our favourite hotel so far on our vacation - according to our children and ourselves.There were lots of holiday makers/ families staying here, but also business people.The atrium is a huge hit - great to look at, and the opportunity to feed the fish twice per day is wonderful.The rooms are spacious, having two vanities outside the bathroom is handy and having a door between the bedroom and living room is needed when you have children going to bed. (Beds are wonderful.)The included breakfasts are great - lots of variety. Plenty of room to find a table.The free evening nibbles and drinks are also great when you have kids - saves rushing out for an early dinner.The laundry fees are only a dollar per wash, which is good value. Internet costs $9.95 per day, which is our only gripe.Concierge and all staff were friendly and helpful. I definitely recommend this as great accommodation - including for families.

<Content>Great for Families, central location to metro This was the 3rd time we have stayed here in 3 years. 2X while we looked at local colleges. On our first night as we came back from dinner I requested extra towels at the front desk, there were 5 of us, the towels were in the room before we even got upstairs. My daughters have very long hair which gets everywhere when they brush it, each day the bathroom and rooms were spotless, they even left extra soap and shampoo once they knew there were 5 of us in the room. Staff always said Good Morning  Good Evening. The breakfast is one of the reasons we stayed here each time. Each person was able to find something to eat each day, whether it was the pancakes, omlettes, waffles, bagels or oatmeal we never went hungry. There is plenty of other stuff to eat too! Garage is spotless and you can fit a minivan in the space. You need a code to get in and out of the garage so we knew our car was safe. Use the metro instead of driving around the city. Metro is very easy and fast and Dupont Circle is only 4-5 blocks from the hotel. There are many restaurants in Dupont Circle so we ate there 2 nights after our travels around the city. If you are not from a metropolitan area like New York, Boston, Chicago be prepared for the food prices all over even pizza places. Dinner for the 5 of us at nice restaurants averaged $110 including tip, no alcohol, only sodas. Good prices since we are from the NY Metro area where dinner for the 5 of us averages $150 but others have found the DC prices high.

<Content>Convenient and Classy Property While in town for a convention, I spent an evening at this property in one of the Conference Suites. The room was enormous and consisted of a large conference room with a 12-seat table, a wet bar, oversized bathroom and large bedroom. The suite was a corner room, so I was able to enjoy the view as well. The front desk was very accomodating, and allowed me to check in far earlier than normal. Check in was quick and efficient.The concierge was able to arrange last minute transportation for me to Alexandria, VA. I was disappointed that the shuttle could not take me, but the independent van driver was excellent, albeit expensive.Room service was wonderful and quick. AM breakfast was better than I had expected, but very, very busy. There are both hot and cold self service offerings and a great selection of beverages.The only problem I ran into was the wireless internet service. I use a Mac, and never have any connection issues when using public wi-fi. Normally, a lack of internet service doesn't pose a problem, but I had a presentation to edit and needed dedicated service. The front desk was again attentive and walked me through the steps necessary to connect, but it was of no help. I gave up and tried again much later that evening knowing that the hours between 6PM and 9PM are very busy for hotel connectivity. BY 11PM, I was connected to the Hilton E-Help desk in Texas and a technician walked me through everything. I was able to connect from that point forward. Sadly, I was charged the full rate for the service and would have been very responsive to a discount or service comp for the time and trouble...oh well...I got a great deal on the room, so no loss. There are a number of nice restaurants within a two or three block radius. I chose to take the Metro into Maryland to meet friends, and was amazed at the ease and convenience of the public transportation system.Overall, this hotel did an amazing job. The staff was friendly and attentive, and to me, that was the most important aspect of my stay.

<Content>Great hotel, superb staff Stayed here on the basis of the great TA reviews and the hotel certainly lived up to it's good reviews. Airline lost my luggage and the hotel staff couldn't have been nicer, providing lots of toiletries and checking us in really late at night.The room was really lovely, smashing bed and lots of fluffy towels in a very smart bathroom and all so clean.It's a pretty busy hotel so if you're looking for tranquility and real peace this is not the place for you. The location is not dead centre but it's near enough to walk and there's plenty nearby.It's a fabulous hotel for kids they all seemed to be having a ball - from the big breakfasts to the free drinks and popcorn feast each evening. The breakfast was ideal - a good selection and although it seems really busy you don't have much problem getting what you need.The free bar each evening is amazing . They have really friendly staff who chatted to all the guests, there was also snacks every night to accompany the drinks, nachos, salsa, pretzels etc a nice wee cocktail break. I would definately stay here again when visiting Washington.

<Content>overrated on this website I do not see why this hotel has been #1 on TA for so long. I was disappointed. The rooms/carpets are dirty, The pool and health club have a nasty odor.The housekeeping is really sloppy= they dont wipe the bathroom counters, vacuum rugs etc... The reception staff is ok but not overly helpful. We had three rooms for three days and were celebrating my mother's 70th birthday and the hotel did nothing. Some Chocolates, cookies something small might have been nice. When we asked to be together - they got us on the same floor- but not together. We did get the requested early check in. The hotel sticks to its formula with the big breakfasts and happy hours but at the price point is pretty unremarkable and certainly not deserving of its high ranking on TA. I'll stay elsewhere next time and will not return.

<Content>Second Visit Here - Would Go Back Again As good as our previous stay 12 months earlier. Great value for money. The help yourself breakfasts (included in the price) are wonderful (even managing to operate the waffle maker), and the free drinks and snacks in the evening from 5.30 - 7.30pm are really welcome. There's just such a nice atmosphere about the place. Internet stations are free and available for use in reception. A great idea that you have to stand up to use them, so that some people don't take root.Rooms are large (if a little on the dark side). Genuine HD channels on the TVs too. Fridge to keep things cool. Microwave in the main room as well. Given where the hotel is located, don't expect to see any of DC's sights from your window. Top floor 9 is for Hilton Honors guests.Area feels really safe.

<Content>Embassy Suites in NW DC comes through again! I travel often all over the world, most commonly in the past year to Washington. I use a network of friends and colleagues for references on where to stay, and had tried several DC area referrals; until I locked in on the Embassy Suites on 22nd Street, NW. The staff here remembers me after just a few stays, is always friendly and very gracious, and seemingly is that way to all their guests. It is my only choice for a hotel when I stay in DC here after. It is always clean, the service efficient and responsive, and the management clearly very competent. It has truly become a home away from home for me.

<Content>Where Do I Begin I can't even begin to tell you all how wonderful this hotel is. It is a beautiful hotel that has an open atrium with waterfalls and fish in the ponds. The foliage is lush and the sounds from the water are tranquil. The hotel offers a complimentary breakfast and complimentary drinks and snack (at 5:30 pm). We did not know that there was a game room until we were leaving but we did manage to see the pool which was small but sufficient (anywhere from 10-15 ppl).Another advantage is the location. You're only 5-6 blocks from either the Dupont Circle or Foggy Bottom station. Rooms are cozy with microwaves, refridgerators, and small sink for 'kitchen' needs. Bathrooms are nice too. Staff is very friendly and I am sure you will enjoy your stay. It is #2 on this list for a good reason. It is worth the price. Trust me.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at the Family Friendly Embassy Suites for 3 nights in August. This hotel is in a nice neighborhood and only 10 minutes from the metro. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms were modern, spacious and clean, and they have free all you can eat breakfast. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Loved it! We will definitely stay at this embassy suites when we go back to D.C. The atrium is beautiful. The room was very nice, although in my opinion the living/dining area was a little plain. The flat screen tv was nice. The bedroom was very nicely decorated and very quiet. Breakfast was great (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, grits, oatmeal, waffles, omelets, fruit, yogurt bagels...) and we never had a problem finding a seat. The manager's reception was also a great way to unwind in the evenings. Our 3 year old loved having snack and soda, and also loved the kids movie that plays on the 2nd floor mezzanine each evening during the reception. She also enjoyed getting to feed the fish a few times. We walked to 3 different metro stations from the hotel, and didn't consider any of them too far, in fact we actually enjoyed walking through the city. The staff is excellent!!! One thing, the pool was much smaller than we expected, so we didn't end up swimming as planned. Also, they have a computer in the lobby right by the front desk that you can look up local attractions/restaurants etc - don't use it, ask the staff instead. We looked up drugstore, and it pulled up a CVS that was like 8 blocks away, only to find on the walk home that there is a walgreens 1/2 block away. Anyway, I highly recommend this hotel, particularly to families.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay A great choice for our family of 5 with kids ages 12, 9  6. The breakfasts and manager's receptions were well done. We enjoyed the neighborhood and easy (4-5 block) walk to the subway. My children enjoyed the pool, game room and movies. We found the hotel clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly, although I didn't see the concierge once. As with any city, you will have noise and I think being close to GWU hospital we heard many ambulances. We enjoyed our stay and would stay again.

<Content>shame we only had one night! First sight of the interior is quite spectacular - the waterfall flowing into the courtyard, with the rooms onto balconies all round the outside. It was so restful.The rooms (we had a suite) were spacious, comfy and clean. I had a lovely complimentary pina colada in the evening, and the breakfast was lovely- eaten in the courtyard - with masses of choice. Shame we only had one night there, our last in America after travelling for 3 weeks - it was probably the nicest hotel of all those we stayed at.

<Content>Excellent - superb for families My family really enjoyed our stay here and will definitely not consider any other hotel in DC now. The staff are great and can not do enough to help and the hotel is really family focused. Breakfasts are great and less stressful than at other Embassy Suites and the evening receptions are fun and a great way for the children to meet friends. The children's cinemas and goldfish feeding are a great touch. The rooms are also very nice and unobtrousively made-up everyday. We only wish we had stayed longer.

<Content>Happy with my hotel choice in DC I just spent 5 nights at the Embassy Suites in Washington DC. We checked out the reviews of many hotels and chose this one because of the size of the room. We are a family of 5 (kids are 14, 12, and 9) and it seems that most hotels only have room for 4 people squished into 2 double beds. My wife and I slept in a king bed in a bedroom and the 3 kids slept in the main room. Two shared the queen pullout and we brought an air mattress for the other. 2 TV's, one bathroom, overall perfectly fine for us and better than spending $$ on 2 rooms. The managers reception is daily from 5:30 to 7:30 and we didn't miss a day. Cold beer, veggies, nachos, chips, popcorn etc. The kids made use of the small but adequate indoor pool almost every day. We had friends who stayed at the Westin Grand around the corner and they spent their spare time at our hotel which was much more fun for the kids.The decor is not the greatest, but the hotel was clean, comfortable, and the service was very good - including the restaurant. The location seemed fine. I would certainly go back without hesitation. Not a cheap hotel by any means, but nothing is in Washington...

<Content>Superb Just fanatastic, lovely open-air feel to the atrium, big comfy rooms (suites), great (free) breakfasts, free cocktails at around 6pm, numerous (free) internet terminals in the lobby. Very helpful concierge. Nice pool  sauna (although small). Great for families. The location isn't perfect, as it's not that central and a 10 min work to the Metro, but otherwise this place is hard to fault!

<Content>A Decent Hotel After reading many of the reviews on Trip Advisor I was a bit apprehensive about this (and other) hotels on our recent vacation to the East Coast. Our four night stay at the Embassy Suites was quite pleasant. The food was OK, and much better than what we had at many places on this trip. The morning breakfast had some lines but what would I expect from a hotel with nine or ten floors. We made it a point to get down there early enough and our breakfasts were always hot. If I had to define a criticism of anything on this stay I guess it would be that the front desk personnel didn't seem very friendly to me, but they were usually pretty busy with waiting on customers so that's understandable too. We would definately stay at the Embassy Suites again. Our son loved the pool and game room, the elevators were fast and the location was very convenient with a pharmacy/convenience store on the corner and a Starbucks next to that. The traffic in Washington was absolutely horrendous, but that wasn't the hotels fault, :), and in spite of that we still managed to take the van out and about the city on numerous occasions because we had very convenient underground parking with our room.

<Content>Good hotel and location My husband, 14-yr-old son and I stayed here for 6 nights at the end of July. We took a cab to/from the hotel (~$17 ea way). It is within walking distance of the metro, but if you have luggage I would recommend a cab instead (you never know when the escalators may not be operating plus it's just a hassle to try to drag luggage around on a metro). We had a suite (dining room, living room w/ flat screen and pull out queen bed, and separate bedroom w/ king bed and tv), so there was plenty of space and the refrigerator and microwave were useful for leftovers. The room was clean and spacious, and housekeeping did a good job every day.The breakfasts are pretty good -- you can make your own waffles, or stand in line for made-to-order eggs, and they have everything else buffet-style - scrambled eggs, pancakes, sausage, biscuits and gravy, hash browns, cold cereal, juice, coffee, muffins/danishes, yogurt, etc. You do need to get there early enough so they don't run out of something you might want (such as fruit). They are also very busy unless you get there early.We did not go to any of the manager's cocktail parties, or use the pool or fitness rooms as we ended up either returning late in the evening, or, on the few days we got back early, we were too tired from the walking and heat to do anything but relax in our suite.We also had 1 dinner at the hotel's Italian restaurant. We found it to be pretty good, better quality than we had expected for a hotel restaurant. Price-wise, it was about what you would expect from a hotel restaurant. (For fun restaurant, we really enjoyed the Capitol Grille on Pennsylvania Ave....it was expensive, but it was a really neat atmosphere. )I would recommend this hotel for a family or business trip. (The reason I rated it 4 stars rather than 5 is I thought their rates were a bit expensive)

<Content>Close to everything Stayed for six days in early August. The staff was friendly and provided good suggestions on getting around and directions. We walked to Georgetown University and Lincoln Memorial on two different days - on other days we used the metro to travel. The manager's reception had good drinks and plenty of soft drinks available with different munchies each night. The breakfast was good, but very hectic in the last hour of serving. Many foods would run out and weren't replenished quickly. Also, the setup of the area was inefficient causing people to bunch up when waiting in line.Embassy Suites has become a hotel of families. That's why we stay there, but it can be noisy depending on who your neighbor is. Given it is mainly a hotel of families, it's surprising the in-hotel restaurant is a fancy Italian restaurant. Perhaps making it a bit more family-oriented would result in more people eating there in the evening. However, there were plenty of more family-oriented restaurants in the area.

<Content>Good location, but you might do better We spent 4 nights at the hotel. The room was very nice and a good size, with 2 TVs and a fridge which we found very useful. The things we found a bit disappointing were that the concierge never seemed to be about when you needed assistance, and the advice given at reception proved inaccurate on several occasions which almost made us make some very poor decisions in our planning. The manager's drinks in the evening were very welcome, if limited in the choice of nibbles. The arrangements for the buffet breakfast were rather hectic. There never seemed to be a good time to get there, and finding a table could be tricky. It was always very busy. The layout means loads of people queuing or milling about all the time, and some of the queues were, at times, rather long. And my final concern was, I am sure, not a regular occurrance, but we arrived back at the hotel mid-afternoon to find our door and the door of the room next to ours open, with no cleaning or maintenance staff anywhere near. Indeed no-one came to the room in the 1/2 hour I waited. I never did get an explanation as to why they had left our room open for anyone to walk in.

<Content>Great vacation My family and I stayed at the Embassy Suites DC over 4th of July weekend and had a great time. I used Hilton points to book the stay, requesting the two bedroom presidential suite, and actually got it. The room was huge! Two full bedrooms and two baths, living room, dining room. Way more than we needed but the kids loved it. Flat panel TV's in each bedroom and the living room. The service was very good. The staff always helpful. There was a water leak over the bar area that was fixed in a flash. I guess the only complaint would be the air conditioner was quite noisy so I guess if you were a light sleeper you might have problems.As with all Embassy's, full breakfast is included. Being the 4th of July weekend, it was pretty crowded each morning but the food was fine and we were always able to find a table. It saves a lot to be able to eat a free big breakfast each day.The location of the hotel is great. It's a quiet area close to DuPont Circle. There are many restaurants within a 10 minute walk. The Foggy Bottom metro station is a 10 minute walk away which will get you anywhere. We walked into Georgetown one day with no complaints from the kids.I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Number 1 in DC? No Way! We have been here for 4 nights and are leaving tomorrow. We have stayed here many times before and thought the value was excellent, but now we feel differently. We paid $ 399 for our room and it is not worth it. the room and hotel are starting to show their age. The hallway carpets are old, buckling and filthy, the wallpaper in the room is peeling off and stained, the room carpet is in terrible shape and the trim needs a good coat of paint. the pool is the size of a matchbook and is way too small for a busy hotel this size. there are about 10 chairs for 400 guests. After sightseeing all day, this is not a relaxing pool to be in. The tiles are moldy and falling off and the ceiling tiles are off because of leaking.My husband was the only one to do breakfast this morning and he stood in line 3 different times, each one for 15 mins. He then sat at the only available table that was dirty with dishes and syrup. He said next time he will go somewhere and pay for breakfast.The only great experience we had with this place were with the bartenders at the manager,s reception - they were excellent. The location is good, about 5 long blocks each way to the 2 metro stations about 15 mins, but there are many hotels in this area.I guess we are just getting old and less tolerant with crowds and busy hotels. We figured next time for the money we can stay somewhere nicer and have a relaxing time instead of being annoyed.

<Content>Are there two Embassy suites? I chose the Embassy Suites based on its #1 popularity, and previous fine experience with the chain in three other cities. (And other properties closer to the main stream sights were booked solid. To be fair there was a convention in town that brought in 25, 000 visitors we're told.) Our Corner suite was exactly what I was looking for as I was traveling with my teen age son. The poor kid has suffered through the fold-out sofa bed routine, and so this was to be his graduation treat. And for $489 a night, it should have been special. The bedroom and sitting room were on the warm side when we got there, but figured it would be cooler after dinner. It wasn't. The engineer tried all he could, including changing a dirty air filter. But it didn't really help, and when I woke up in the middle of the night my son had moved to the sofa as it was marginally cooler there. The next day the engineering people came back and disabled the motion sensors so the system would run constantly. Around 11 PM the front desk offered us a choice of some portable fans, and to move us to a smaller room. We chose the latter and fortunately was very comfortable. Except that there was only a King Bed and a Fold Out Sofa, so the kid was back to banging his shins on the metal bed frame. When I left I inquired if there would be any adjustment in the $489 rate as we had a smaller room without the two beds, and was told it wouldn't be possible as the hotel was so busy.Location: A $10 cab ride (plus tip) away from everything and anything. Or, a l-o-n-g hot walk to tour bus stops, and public transit. Summary: your customary Embassy Suites with a good morning breakfast, and evening happy hour. Just a strange location.

<Content>Would definitely go back to this hotel We stayed at the Embassy Suites which I chose based on Trip Advisor reviews. We were very pleased with our stay and would definitely recommend it. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. The rooms were clean and spacious, more than enough room for my husband and I and our 12 and 14 year old sons. The extra sink in the bedroom came in very handy when getting ready. The location is good, about a 15 min. walk to the White House and about 10 min. to the Metro if you don't feel like walking to the sights. The hot breakfast was good and convenient (you don't have to worry about finding a restaurant or paying ridiculous prices for cereal and coffee). My son enjoyed making his own belgian waffles each morning. Yes it can be busy in the morning but we just went down 1/2 hr earlier which was no big deal. If you like Italian, there's a great little restaurant close by, Luigi's. Overall, we had a really good experience with this hotel and would return.

<Content>Great Experience at the Embassy Suites - Washington D.C. We recently returned from an eight day vacation in Washington D.C. and stayed at this Embassy Suites Property. Our family of five, including two teenage girls and a 12 year old boy, booked two spacious rooms that met all of our needs. The property is located in the NW quadrant of the city and is a short walk to all of the sites including the White House, the memorials, all of the Smithsonian museums and Georgetown. We walked everywhere and when we didn't want to walk we took the very efficient Metro which was only three short blocks away. The hotel rooms were clean and comfortable. The small refrigerator came in mighty handy to store lots of water and snacks that were bought at the Walgreens or CVS which was only one block away. (along with the Starbucks which for me was a necessity). The free breakfast in the morning combined with the free cocktail hour at night put the icing on the cake for us. This hotel made our stay in Washington D.C. much more relaxing and enjoyable. I highly recommend the Embassy Suites in Washington D.C. at M and 22nd streets. One hint for families traveling to D.C. in the summer. It's hot so stay at this hotel and walk three blocks to the large free public pool for a quick refreshing dip.

<Content>Great location, good deal We booked this Embassy Suite because of the reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. The rooms were big and clean. The beds were comfortable, including the sofa bed. The staff is very friendly. The breakfast was tasty with a big selection and the afternoon reception was plentiful with drinks and snacks for all. The location is also good. It is a little walk to the Metro. Would stay there again and again. We also really liked the free internet kiosk in the lobby, about 8 stations.

<Content>Great value! We arrived in around 5:00 and received a warm welcome from the staff. Our room was spacious and comfortable and it was great that everyone had their own bed. The loveseat in the sitting area folded out into a bed. My daughter who slept out there did complain about the noise so be aware that that noisy neighbors can be heard from this room. The evening reception was delightful and very much appreciated. Beer and wine and various drinks were served as well as soda and juice. There were munchies that my family of four enjoyed. During the weekend the place was milling with kids. We have two teenagers so this did not bother us at all. The complete breakfast was the highlight and it does pay to get up early to avoid a long line. The one morning we slept in there was still plenty of food. There are coin laundry machines for those who desire to do some wash. There is a walk of a few blocks to the metro which under normal circustances would never have phased us but because there is so much walking/standing in DC we did feel quite tired by the end of the day. We ordered a delivered pizza from Luigis (just okay). We ate dinner at Johnny Rockets, (decent and 50's atmoshpere) a Chinese restarant right around the corner that was decent, TGIF (great food but just okay service) and The Front Page in Dupont Circle which was excellent in every way. The hotel was a great bargain in every way and I would highly recommend it to families wanting to visit DC. If you have young children, you may want to tour with a company that picks you up and drops you off due to all the walking you will end up doing if you tour on your own.

<Content>Embassy Suites; good choice for DC tourists We stayed at the Embassy Suites over the July 4th holiday. As you would expect, the hotel was packed, but we had a good experience. The hotel is in a great location because you could take a long walk and get to most sites, or walk just a few blocks and hop on the Metro. The room was a bit dated..not the most comfortable furniture, but it was nice to have a suite for a family of 4. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel. In fact, I booked it because of the positive reviews I saw on Trip Advisor!

<Content>The best, by far! We stayed here for four nights over the Fourth of July with three small boys (ages 6, 4 and 3). This hotel is perfectly located and is incredibly family friendly. The breakfasts and the afternoon pool scenes can get a bit crowded but with some simple time planning you can work around it.Three blocks from Dupont Circle and the Metro, about a mile rom the White House and close to several family-friendly resturaunts. We were completely satisfied with our expeience. If you are travelling to DC with your family, this is the place to stay.

<Content>Perfect Place for a Family to stay in D.C. We (my husband and I and our six children ages 14 to 3) stayed for two nights in two connecting king suites. The staff was very plesant to us. They even arranged for us to park our full size van at the Marriot Hotel accross the street, because our vehicle was too tall for their underground parking garage. We had plenty of room to spread out! Lots of soft chairs and the bedding was so comfortable. The corner suite had a dining table with six seats, while the other suite had a table for four. The manager's reception was a little different both nights. We only drank the soft drinks (serve yourself machines), but they also served cocktails. The first night they set out fresh veggies and dip with potato chips and pretzles. The second night there was salsa, guacamole, tortilla chips and pretzles. Both nights they also had popcorn. The kids enjoyed filling up their tray with some before heading back to the room for watching TV. In the morning, the breakfast was wonderful. In addition to the made to order omlets, there was also, scrambled eggs, bacon one morning and sausages the other, pancakes, oatmeal, potatoes, and make your own waffles. You could have cereal, yogurt, muffins, toast, bagles, and fresh fruit, too. There were different kinds of coffees, tea, milk, and juices. We never had a problem finding two tables of four for all of us to sit down to eat. We filled up here so, we only needed a light lunch and plenty of water while sight seeing! We were pleased that the hotel was in walking distance of all the attractions. We did not use the metro. We walked from 22nd Street to 15th street, then took Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. We started out just before 9 a.m. and managed to see all the memorials in the morning and the Air and Space Museum along with the Museum of Natural History in the afternoon. There was just enough time for a swim at the hotel's pool (which was not that small and there is also a hot tub) before the manager's reception. We enjoyed ordering pizza from Manny and Olga's who delivered to our room. It was delicious and just $20 for two pizzas! We retired to our room that night to rest our tired feet. The kids did not have to fight over the TV since we had four! We left the next morning after breakfast. The Iwa Jima Memorial and Arlington were our last stop before heading home to Indiana. Anyone who asks us about our trip to Washington D.C. will also hear about the two wonderful nights we spent at the Embassy Suites Hotel. My kids will tell you it was the best hotel they ever stayed in!

<Content>good- a bit overpriced hotel itself is very nice. Positives-good location, breakfast included, nightly open bar reception with cheap snacks, big rooms with flat panel tv, frig, microwave, kid friendly. Negatives-- not cheap (free breakfast, recption etc is not really free- its part of your room rate which was 350+ a night during late april ), managers recption is really fair wine , watered down frozen drinks etc. with pretzels, chips--not real food in the evening although kids were happy), slow elevators with other kids often pushing all the buttons, a tiny indoor pool that is as overcrowded as ive ever seen and completely overrun with kids (and i love kids!!), extra charge per day for in room internet-insane!, small computer terminals free in lobby often were nonfunctional, parking was in the hotel 1 block away --same charge as lot in hotel always too crowded, one day the maids just never came--several phone calls lead to this being rectified at 730 pm after being out the whole day. All in all would stay here only if i had kids and while i would return it would only be with a better deal on the room. Will likely consider other places although all in all it was nice --keep in mind the above and look for a discounted rate.

<Content>Lived Up To The Hype And More I recently stayed at the Embassy Suites for a week to attend a seminar in Washington. I also brought along my family so I was looking for a more family friendly hotel. After reviewing Trip Advisor I chose the Embassy Suites. Not to be snobbish, but normally my wife and I would never stay at an Embassy Suites as we usually stay at higher end places when we travel alone. So with some reservation, and based solely upon the outstanding Trip Advisor reviews, I booked the hotel. Let me just say that my stay proves once again that Trip Advisor is never wrong. My family and I had an absolutely wonderful stay. The staff is the most friendly and helpful group of employees that you will encounter. The hotel is also beautiful. The room was spotless, comfortable and big. The free food at breakfast and at the manager's reception is fantasic for the kids (ok, I admit I also took great advantage of the free drinks). For whatever reason, the other guests and the numerous kids running around were also extremely friendly. Finally, the hotel is in a excellent location. If you have kids (or even if you don't have kids) this is the place to stay. KUDOS ONCE AGAIN TO TRIP ADVISOR!

<Content>Manager's Reception is divine! My husband and I recently spent time at the Embassy Suites in Washington. We are not accustomed to staying at large chain hotels, so I had pretty low expectations. (We prefer small, boutique-y kinds of places...) Happily, I was surprised and delighted to realize what a superb experience and fantastic value you get at this hotel. The rooms are lovely and huge and the facilities numerous. They have special activites just for kids. The free breakfast in the morning is great, too. What REALLY makes this place superb, though, is the Manager's reception that is offered daily from 5:30 to 7:30 pm. Included in the reception are snacks and FREE cocktails. FREE!!!!!! You aren't even expected to tip. We were so pleased with our experience we'd do it again, and I'd recommend it to anyone I know.

<Content>tripadvisor is the BEST! BEST HOTEL!!! 2 adults only! My wife and I went to Washington, DC for pleasure and I carefully researched hotels through tripadvisor, knowing nothing about about DC, coming from the west coast. I noted some reviews about the number of children in the hotel, and some other negative comments, but also noted the high rating on tripadvisor and booked it for 5 nights.We arrived and asked for a room away from the elevator and were given one, but as it turned out there were NO rooms at the elevator in the design of this hotel. While one could still hear the ding of the elevator when it came to a floor, you could NOT hear ANYTHING from the rear bedroom. And we NEVER heard our neighbors in the hotel...either from side to side, or from above. The rooms were spacious and the flatscreen TV with high-def channels was GREAT for the limited time we were actually in the room.The breakfast buffet was the best we have ever had at an Embassy Suites hotel! The potatoes were actually seasoned with appropriate spices and there were excellent options for omelets, waffles, pancakes, fresh fruit, english muffins, pastries, and nice strong coffee!While there were MANY children in the hotel, we never saw that as a problem during our stay! There were also internet kiosks in the lobby to allow you to print off boarding passes or check email.After we settled into the room, it was dinner time and we asked at the desk for a restaurant recommendation, and were told it was a short walk to Georgetown, which was full of restaurant (and we later learned, shopping) choices. It was THEN that we learned that this hotel was such a great choice for central location in Washington, DC!So enough for the hotel, absolutely no complaints! To travel around DC, check out the Circulator bus! It travels from Union Station on the west of DC through Georgetown on the east side, from the river district on the east on a north/south loop to the convention center, and on a weekend loop around the mall, all for $1 per trip, or $3 for an all-day pass! Much cheaper than taxies, saves on walking (and there is a lot of walking in DC), and the buses run very frequently.

<Content>Great Place For Families Great hotel for tourist travel to DC, particularly with kids. Very family friendly. We were there for a week this June and found it to be a perfect location to see all the sights. We took cabs to the museums from the hotel and never paid more than $13 for the trip (with two per day, that comes to the same price as parking a car at the hotel). The included breakfast every morning is tasty and extensive and my son loved the managers reception every evening for snacks. I also can't say enough positive things about the staff. They were friendly and helpful with directions, flagging down cabs, and keeping the rooms and the grounds clean. The biggest downside to our stay is that we appeared to be there during school field trip season, so there were large swarms of somewhat unsupervised kids using the public areas. While this is a downside, it is certainly not the fault of the hotel. The Itallian restaurant in the hotel was very good, and there are a number of other restaurant options in easy walking distance of the hotel, through nice neighborhoods, including a number of embassies. Tip for tired sightseers - there are several local restaurants that will deliver to your room! We stretched a tasty Thai dinner out for two days. SInce the rooms are equiped with microwave and refridgerator, eating in the room is a reasonable option as well.

<Content>Perfect for families We have just returned from a two days trip of washington D.C.The stay at embassy suites was perfect. Room was bigger.It had a living room with flat screen T.v and a bedroom with normal tv and a little kitchen with microwave , small refrigerator and additional sink which was perfect when you have 5 years old and 6 monthe old. The extra sink was perfect for washing bottels and other stuff.The complementry breakfast was very good with wide selection of food and cook to order breakfast. The ambience of the hotel was excellent with two waterfall and palm trees and gold fish in the pond. It was very relaxing after a long day of sightseeing. Evening manager's special was fantastic .With a wide range of beverages (including alcohol) and a snack like nacho cheese, prezel, salsa and cheese cubes which made a perfect snack for kids. Overall, this hotel is perfect when you travel with kids .i would definately stay there again.

<Content>Can definitely recommend this hotel A lot has been written about this hotel, so I won't repeat it all again, but I do want to mention a few things. The check-in was the friendliest I've experienced, even down to giving the kids a welcome DC souvenir each!The included breakfast is great, sets you up for the day and the kids loved making their own waffles!And on return to the hotel in the evening it was lovely to sit and relax with a complimentary drink and snacks.Soundproofing seems to be good, wasn't aware of noise from other rooms.

<Content>Good Choice We stayed at the Embassy although we were going to be attending a family wedding in another hotel two blocks away that offered a similar rate. We are HHonors members and have been completely satisfied with all the hotels in the Hilton group that we have stayed at in the past two years. The reviews on trip advisor had convinced us that the Embassy was the right choice. We had a very long walk to the elevator from the room but despite that this is a professionally run and friendly hotel and we would recommend it.

<Content>Great for families Stayed over Massachusetts' April vacation week with my husband and 2 sons (ages 7 and 4). This is the ideal hotel for families. Having a suite is key after the kids go to bed. They also loved the breakfast and evening manager's reception. I would not recommend this hotel for adults without children, though. This hotel is crawling with families--in my opinion, that's a great thing! One down side is that the closest Metro stations are a bit of a hike (Foggy Bottom or Dupont Circle). Otherwise, highly recommended!

<Content>I am so glad we chose this hotel!! Based on all of the previous trip advisor reviews,we cancelled another hotel reservation in the DC area and booked with this hotel. I am so glad that we did. After a bit of a frantic drive to the hotel, we arrived to be treated like royalty. Check in was quick and efficient as well as very friendly. The room was delightful, large and comfortable. The morning breakfast was a big plus and quite a savings if we had had to purchase breakfast. The only minor drawback and I have seen others mention it as well is the walking distance to the Foggy Bottom Metro. It took about 10-12 minutes so it was not right around the corner.

<Content>Reliably Good We've stayed at this Embassy Suites several times over the past 10+ years (both before and since our son was born), which I suppose says enough. While the property doesn't wow, it's dependable, comfortable, and pleasant.The location is great--out of the immediate bustle for downtown but part of the vibrant Dupont Circle area. The Mall, Georgetown, and other attractions and neighborhoods are a very manageable walk away, but the Metro station is nearby if you want to catch a train.The breakfast buffet is a nice perk. It's diverse and substantial enough to satisfy a full range of appetites, from those wanting a healthy, post-workout refresher to those who view all-you-can-eat as a challenge. The evening reception is OK--worth going to if you're sitting around the hotel but not worth hurrying back for. The snacks are standard reception fare, with the healthier options being particularly uninspired. Likewise for the beer and wine selections. The frozen drinks--popular with many--are crazy sweet. Still, there are various soft drinks and juices available too.If you're craving a good workout, there are endless great places to run from the hotel. If you want to stay in house, the workout room is well-equipped for being as small as it is. Likewise for the pool/whirlpool/sauna area. It can be a raucous kid-magnet at times, but there are also a couple adults-only hours each day.I've taken to describing this as our default hotel. Until something else comes along with a better combination of location, price, and amenities, we'll keep coming back.

<Content>Great trip,great hotel We recently stayed here for 3 nights over the memorial day weekend. This was our first time in Washington DC. We traveled with our 2 sons ages 18 and 10, and another 18 year old friend of our sons. We really were impressed with this hotel. Check in was very smooth and pleasant. The room was very clean and well appointed. Even though there were 5 of us, we had plenty of room. We liked the 2 TV's and the big flat screen in the living area was nice. My 10 year old missed having the Disney channel on the cable, but we weren't there to watch TV anyway.  With 2 teenagers along, we were up late and slept late, so we never went down to breakfast before at least 10:00. Breakfast was awesome, and even with the hotel being full, and the lateness of the hour, there was always plenty of food. Of course you can't beat the price-FREE!! We had been on a cruise in March, and my youngest said it reminded him of a cruise breakfast. Thus the free brunch carried us through to late afternoon. The location was great. We were just a few blocks from the Foggy Bottom/GWU metro station, and we found out just how convenient that is. Metro is the only way to travel to the sites in DC. Also great was the area-it was very clean, and appeared safe. You were within a few blocks of all the charm, restaurants and shops of Georgetown and Dupont Circle. The fact that a Walgreens, Starbucks, and a great Chinese restaurant were right across the street were tremendous bonuses for us as well. Our 10 year old had a great time at the pool every night after doing so much walking to see all the sites. Yes it is a small pool, and did get a bit crowded, but that didn't bother Marc at all. The 18 year olds were pleased to be able to surf the internet for free at the computer kiosks. The concierge and front desk were very helpful as far as helping us get around to where we wanted to go, and things to do. We will definitely stay at this hotel again when we are in DC-which could be within the next year. There just is too much we didn't get to see in such a short time.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel; Small Pool Area I was very pleased with the Embassy. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were nice and spacious. The hotel was very clean and updated with flat panel tv's in the living room. My biggest complaint was the amount we had to pay for parking. I believe it was $26 a day which is really ridiculous. The manager's reception was not much to brag about but the complimentary breakfast was one of the best I have ever received from any other hotel I stayed at. There was plenty to choose from. The pool was small and full of children but the kids enjoyed every bit of it. They did complain about the water being salty but other than that they had a blast. The kids also got to feed the fish in the atrium which they enjoyed doing as well. We had a blast and will return when we head back to DC.

<Content>Perfect for families with kids We stayed at Embassy Suites DC last week and were traveling with a 2 year-old and 5 month-old. This place was perfect for our needs and had extra little perks that made it the best experience of our trip. Great location a pleasant walk from the Dupont Circle Metro station. Breakfast was great, the free happy hour was welcome after long days seeing the sites, and the 2 year-old loved feeding the koi. The staff was all extremely helpful and friendly, including a prompt delivery of a made-up baby crib. We also actually ordered room service from the in-house Italian restaurant and were surprised by how good and relatively affordable it was.All of these things offset the only minor downsides. We did hear sirens sometimes while going to sleep, due to the proximity to GWU hospital. It didn't really keep us awake, but for light sleepers it could be an issue. Also, they didn't have Disney Channel which for us was a slight disappointment, but we were able to live without it.All in all, we can't wait to go back.

<Content>Great location and great price We booked this hotel almost solely on the recommendations from this site and were really glad that we did. The location is great (about 25 minutes walk to the White House) and the price is too. The rooms were clean and very spacious, the staff were helpful and polite. Having the living area on the inside of the atrium meant that we weren鈥檛 disturbed by the noise of the waterfalls, but if that space was used for sleeping it could be a little noisy. The all-inclusive breakfast was varied and plentiful. It was fine for food to be taken back to rooms. We went down around 8am each day, but noticed that even at 9.30am there still seemed to be plenty of everything. The Manager鈥檚 Reception was a great plus. The quality of drinks and snacks wasn鈥檛 amazing, but then it is free and we could go back for a second round. The on-site restaurant was fine, but not very exciting. The shop is handy and open until late. The hotel is very family friendly, which might put some people off but we weren鈥檛 there to sit around in the hotel so weren鈥檛 bothered by the number of children. The pool was pretty small and occupied by lots of children, which was a shame but to be expected. There is a charge for internet access in rooms, but there is a small business centre (3 PCs) and also two PC鈥檚 near the elevators, which was fine for the occasional checking of email. We had a really great stay here and would thoroughly recommend it to others.

<Content>Nice Hotel  Was last here in spring of 07. This time it was easter break. LOTS OF CHILDREN!!!! The staff did an amazing job with the FB for Breakfast and Manager's reception. The hotel did switch over to compact florescent lighting in the room fixtures. Grade A for effort, but D for execution. They have mixed color types. Some fixtures within the rooms and complete rooms are super nova white (industrial parking garage/spot light) and others are natural soft white. You can tell by looking at the picture windows in the atrium during the evening. They did change my room over to the soft whit when asked, but hopefully this will be delt with soon than later. But given they last five years, I hope they realize the mistake and take the hit.

<Content>Great place to stay if you have kids... We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights during a recent trip to DC. The hotel is located in a nice area with restaurants within walking distance and a drugstore right around the corner.The breakfast was a definite bonus for a family with 4 children. There was something for everyone to eat. The staff was friendly and seemed very attentive to clearing the tables.I would agree that there were a lot of children (tweens) mulling about the hotel, but they didn't seem disruptive or poorly behaved.The pool was pretty crowded. It was tough to find a spot to put our things down, but other hotel guests seemed willing and friendly enough to give up a seat. The kids had a great time.My husband noted that the parking lot was a few blocks down at the Ritz Carlton lot. This may be a problem for people with difficulty walking.Overall, our stay here was very pleasant. The rooms were cleaned properly. When I called to request extra towels, pillows, and hangers, the staff was very accommodating.

<Content>What a disappointment After reading such glowing reviews for this hotel, I was stunned to find what I did. The rooms were run-down and shabby. The carpeting was stained and dirty. The furniture scratched. The cushions and decorative pillows stained. The front desk was rude. And the parking was several blocks from the hotel. Apparently they had met the capacity in their own parking lot, so we had to park in a lot belonging to another hotel. We were not offered a parking discount for this inconvenience. I love kids, I have three of my own, but this hotel was swarming with them. It felt like we were at a 24/7 party at a Chucky Cheese. I can not understand why this hotel is rated so highly.

<Content>Phenominal hotel I have been staying at Embassy Suites with my parents since I was a little kid but this was my first trip as an adult. It had been a good amount of years and the only memory I had was the giant goldfish in the streams that run through the lobby. Well this trip will be one I will not soon forget.Everyone at the hotel was extremely nice, and while it is a family hotel the manager's reception every evening is akin to a free 2 hour nightly open bar. By the end of our stay everyone who worked at the breakfast and the manager's reception knew both my name as well as my girlfriend's and our drink orders. Everyone was always nice and smiling and the concierge at the front desk was very knowledgable about the area.It was nice to have a parking lot where we could park and forget about our car even if it was a little expensive, the free drinks and snacks as well as the free breakfast more than made up for it. Overall, not only a tremendous value but also a beautiful hotel. Even though I am in my mid 20's I partook in the goldfish feeding and had a great time. The metro was a few blocks away and a little confusing to get to the first time but the hotel was in a great location none the less. Highly recomended.

<Content>Perfect Hotel for Family Vacation! We recently stayed at the Embassy Suites for a quick famiily vacation. It was just perfect for our trip. Both metro stations are closeby, making getting around the city easy. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. Plenty of food at breakfast, and it really made this hotel a great value for the location. The kids thought it was the best hotel we ever stayed in (I wouldn't go THAT far, we've been to some pretty nice places). They felt very comfortable here and loved all the activities from the pool, internet stations in the lobby and feeding the fish at 6 pm. We will definitely be staying at this property on our next visit to DC.

<Content>Loved the Embassy Suites at the Convention Center The Embassy Suites Convention Center, DC was an excellent location to stay and see all the sites in DC. Easy 15 minute walk to the White House, Spy Museum and 20 mins from the Mall. The rooms are perfect for families traveling with kids. The previous problems listed regarding the buffet breakfast seemed to be resolved. We were down at 'peak' times and always enjoyed plenty of fresh food and the lines were not too long. There are plenty of places to eat near by...from fancy to fast food. Starbucks is right across the street. We encountered a Black Out one of our nights stay. The management quickly alerted us and told us what was happening and kept in contact with us via the intercom system. It was very reassuring.I'd highly recommend this property. It was clean, the staff efficient and a safe neighborhood of DC.

<Content>Great hotel for a weekend trip to DC w/ kids Stayed here last weekend w/ our 3 kids. The room was large enough to accomodate all of us pretty comfortably. The location makes getting around easy by metro, taxi or foot. And, my kids couldn't wait to get back to the hotel, there was lots to do - pool, small game room, ride in the glass elevator etc. The breakfast that is included is plentiful and most importantly even the coffee is good! Additionally, the staff was very nice and accomodating.

<Content>Great hotel for family of 4 on 4 day weekend We chose this hotel for a family junket to DC with two kids, ages 11  14 because of the location, free breakfast and reviews on this site. We were not disappointed! Our room was a King suite with a seperate Queen sleeper sofa that the kids shared. The room was clean and well furnished. Our bed was divine, though the kids complained about the ding of the elevator (we were down the hall from it). We thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast in the mornings, though try not to get there too late as everybody else does, or you'll find yourself in line especially for the popular Belgium waffle station. We used the on-site secure parking at around $26/day and left the car there, opting to walk about 4 blocks to the Foggy Bottom or Dupont Circle Metro stations. We dined at the on-site Italian restaurant the first night. The service and food were great. Because of the location, there are plenty of other dining choices not too far away (loved Marakesh Palace!) Dad and kids enjoyed the indoor pool and hot tub (especially after a full day of sightseeing!) The staff was also very helpful, and there is a free Internet kiosk in the lobby so you can plan out your day. We will definitely return to this hotel!

<Content>Spring Break at Embassy Suites My husband, two children (ages 6 and 8), mother-in-law (MIL) and I stayed at the Embassy Suites for 5 nights over spring break. We had a room with two queen sized beds, and MIL slept on the pullout sofa in the suite. Overall, the room was a bit crowded for the five of us, but since we were sightseeing all day, it worked just fine. It's the perfect size for a family of four. We were on the 5th floor, overlooking N Street, but were never bothered with outside noise. The breakfast and snacks in the evening were great. Even though the hotel was fully booked, we always were able to find a table. The line for home made omelets was long on a couple of the mornings, but only when we ate a little later. They also gave out fish food at 9am and 6pm, so the kids could feed the goldfish in the ponds in the atrium - that was fun for our kids.The pool was my kid's favorite part - even though it was small, they enjoyed swimming in it. The water hurt their eyes, but once we got them goggles it was fine. The older kids rough-housed quite a bit in the evening, so I would recommend using the pool earlier in the evening or in the morning if you have younger children. There's also a fairly nice fitness center. There were 4 or 5 treadmills, each with its own TV. Also an elliptical and a recumbent bike. And some free weights. The treadmills were always available early in the morning or in the evening, but I did walk by around 9am one morning and they were all in use.Regarding location, it was a bit of a walk to the two nearest metro stops. Foggy Bottom was about 3-4 blocks away - while that doesn't sound like much, when it's cold outside and the kids are tired, it seemed like a lot further. Dupont Circle was a bit closer. There were plenty of good restaurants within walking distance. Also a Starbucks just a block away, as well as a Walgreens to stock the fridge in the suite with snacks and drinks. The only thing that irritated me was that there was a fee for the wireless internet access in the suites. However, they had several computer stations set up in the lobby with free internet access, and printing available in the business center. I was always able to find a station when I needed one, even though the hotel was full.Overall, we were very pleased with the hotel. Even though the cost was a bit high, everything was included in the room charge except for wireless internet access. I didn't feel like I was being nickeled and dimed like at other places. This is a great place for a family to stay while in D.C.

<Content>Nice hotel, kids loved it My husband, two daughters (ages 6 and 8) and I stayed at the Embassy Suites for 3 nights. We were impressed by the size of the room considering the location of the hotel (being so close to downtown Washington DC). The room and bath were clean and modern, and the room had a microwave and small fridge. The kids bed was the sofa in the living room, and it was nice to have our own bedroom. The pool was sort of small, but it was clean with tons of towels and the kids loved it. Also, they were able to go into the hot tub so they wanted to swim each day as much as they could. There also was a game room which had about 6-8 machines for the kids. Breakfast was plentiful and although the hotel was full, we had no problems getting a table each morning and having plenty to eat. Between 5:30 and 7:30 in the evening, they had an open bar with snacks (popcorn, chips, salsa, etc) which was great for us to chill out after a day of sightseeing. The staff was friendly and came right to our room when we needed anything. As for location, the hotel is in a nice area and there is a Starbucks within a block, which we loved. The Metro was a few blocks away and cabs were plentiful when we preferred to take them. Overall, a great stay - we will return when we get back to DC!

<Content>Great stay, perfect hotel for families! We stayed here for 3 nights (Fri.-Mon.) in mid-March on a tourist visit of D.C. Although we did not actually bring our child with us, this is a great hotel for families. All rooms are suites with separate bedroom(s) and include a small fridge and microwave. Very clean hotel with great staff and service. We enjoyed a very nice dinner one night at the hotel restaurant Nicola's (Italian/American cuisine). The morning complimentary breaskfast (if you upgrade to the stay for breakfast and not just the standard complimentary breakfast available to all guests)includes a buffet with all the traditional breakfast foods, including made-to-order omlettes, though as busy as the hotel is and with all the families and children staying here, breakfast time is hectic and is better if you get there very early, like before 7:30AM. There are afternoon complimentary snacks, beverages, and alcoholic drinks (for adults of course) for all guests. For the price (if you book a good deal early), this hotel is a great value. George Washington Univ. Hospital and a Fire Station are just a couple blocks away so be ready for their alarms to wake you in the night if your room is streetside (we were on the 6th floor and heard them very well, though we easily fell back asleep after a long day of touring). The Metro is 4 blocks away. DuPont Circle is very close too with many good restaurants. I would definitely stay here again. This was my first Embassy Suites expereince and I will definitely look for them in other cities when I travel.

<Content>Nice hotel - but did not meet expectations We just returned from 5 nights at this hotel, which included president's weekend. We picked the hotel because it was rated #1 on this site. It was very well located, and a good value compared to other similarly located hotels, but it clearly was not able to handle a crowded situation. One of the elevators was broken for the first 3 days of our stay, and we often had to wait over 5 minutes to get an elevator. The stairs were difficult to find and only went to the 2nd floor, not to the lobby, and the stairwells were FILTHY. Once the elevator was fixed, then the elevator wait was fine. In addition, the first two mornings (when the hotel was crowded) the hotel was unable to handle the breakfast crowd, with many people not finding seats and the food ran out frequently with long lines for replenishment. Our room was only marginally clean, and it was very dark. This was the only time we have been disappointed by a hotel selected using this site.

<Content>Very Nice Property We stayed at the Embassy Suites near Georgetown from Dec. 25-20, 2007. I must disclose upfront we are Hilton Honors Gold members and received an upgraded room. And what a room. It had a dining room and living room and bedroom, two flat screen tvs and was well-appointed. It was probably the nicest upgrade we've received so far as Gold Members, although the Disneyworld Hilton was pretty great, too. We had two teeanage daughters and one slept on the pullout sofa and the other, for some unknown reason, slept on two lounge chair pushed together with extra bedding. At least they weren't kicking each other all night. The nightly refreshment hour varied, but the drink offerings were always good. They had two kinds of slushies that alcohol can be added to, if you want. They also had all kinds of sodas and a full bar with decent brands of beer  wine. The snacks ranged from veggies, dip, chips, and pretzels to (one night) just chips and canned salsa. The breakfast was a standard (i.e. good) Embassy Suites offering with pancakes, bacon, eggs, and all kinds of pastries and cereals. The juices were the watery, dispensed kind and not good. Management greeted folks at breakfast.The restaurant was Italian and the food (the pastas tasted fresh made) was good but service was inexperienced. Turnover must be problem here. The pool and hot tub area was clean and warm -- nice during winter. Plenty of towels restocked.The location was a bit of a walk if you weren't cabbing it. We generally took a cab out in the morning to see the sights and took the Metro back home in the evening. We mostly exited at Dupont Circle and walked (downhill!) to our hotel. The area is residential and felt very safe for our family.Overall, I would very much stay here again. The property is on the high end of the Embassy Suites experience.

<Content>Excellent hotel, excellent location My family (2 children aged 7 and 11) have just returned from a long weekend at the Embassy Suites, Washington DC. Overall this is an excellent hotel; very well designed, atrium style complete with waterfall, fish pond, and glass walled elevators. Rooms are spacious and clean with lots of granite, plasma TV, refridgerator, microwave, coffee maker. Included is a complimentary hot breakfast which was pretty good, and also an evening managers reception (i.e. free snacks and drinks/cocktails) between 5.30pm and 7.30pm. The hotel is a few blocks from a Metro station, so very convenient for exploring DC. We did not need a car at all during our stay. It is also close to a number of good restaurants. We tried the Front Page restaurant, and Luigis, both pretty good. Our only complaint was the pool, which was quite small, and therefore always felt crowded. The hot tub was also small and with 3 people in it felt like being in a bathtub. Children were allowed in the hot tub, so it was rarely empty. Apart from that, this really is a very good hotel and I would definitely stay here again on my next visit.

<Content>Outstanding! Have to agree with all the other reviewers, this is a very nice hotel. Spectacular breakfast buffet. Caring management and staff. More than adequate fitness center. Great if you're traveling with kids. In a safe location with plenty of restaurants in walking distance. This is one of the best hotels I've stayed at in a while. The room was humongus. Complimentary cocktails from 5:30 - 7:30. I'm not sure how they can give you so much for free - great value. 15 minute walk to GW university.

<Content>Great Place for grandparents and grandkid Excellent experience. Staff was terrific excluding one young desk guy with kind of an attitude on checking in. Doorman alerted us to a free space on the street, which saved us a day's parking charge. Breakfast was excellent, but earlier advice to be there by 830am was right on. Pool was crowded, but lots of families were there vistiting the DC sights, so understandable. Concierge was very helpful in getting us tickets to a Wizards BB game. Work out room was excellent with PreCore elipticals and good treadmills. Only complaint was lack of really hot water at 8 am on day we left. (We were in King Room on 7th floor.)

<Content>Great place to stay. I wish I knew about it earlier. I have been in a few hotels in DC over the last couple of months but I settled on this one because it had larger rooms (they are suites with two rooms) and because the staff seems willing to make the stay an enjoyable one. I just liked being there. The restaurant downstairs is convenient and even though it's a large hotel, it doesn't feel busy. There were taxis outside waiting all the time, so I never needed to walk to a corner to find one. It's a few blocks from the Metro and sort of within walking distance, but it's not too pleasant on a cold day. I certainly agree with it's current #1 ranking in DC.

<Content>Kids Cried When We Left Room was very clean. It was great having the separate living room, and 2 TVs! Bathrooms and beds were very clean (duvets are washed as well as sheets). Free buffet breakfast was good (included in the price of the room), as well as evening cocktails/snacks. All of the employees at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. Very convenient to both the Dupont Circle (Red Line to zoo) and Foggy Bottom (Blue and Orange Lines to Smithsonian). Kids loved the GameCube in the room, too! Dinner at (and room service from)the hotel's restaurant Nicola's was excellent...kids menu too!Hotel was very busy when we were there. Couldn't get a seat for breakfast at 9am. They ran out of plates, bagels, etc both mornings we were there. Recommend you eat by 8:30 to avoid the rush and have a good selection of food, bread, pastries, etc. Also indoor heated pool was very crowded, ran out of towels. Try to swim at dinner time while everyone else is eating.

<Content>One day in DC We stayed at the DC ES on Friday Feb 8th for a single night. We are a family of 4 with 2 children (9,7) so a safe well located place with 2 rooms and an easy breakfast is very important. This hotel fits that bill nicely. Absolutely no road noise (except for the rare siren), comfortable beds, and a breakfast that allows even the most picky eaters to find something (e.g. pancakes, eggs, sausage, fruit, cereal, made to order omalettes, waffles, coffee, juices, and on and on) made this an easy choice. Admittedly, we tend to prefer to stay at ES's, so the fact that this one was rated #1 in the city made this a no brainer. I do like the fact that ES tend to be very consistent, and this one was no exception. Parking was about $24 a night for indoor self parking, Internet was about $10 for the day, but I got the impression from reading all the other reviews that these charges were similar to other area lodging. The view from our 8th floor (of 9 in the building) was basically another tall building but this hotel is surrounded by simliarly sized buildings, so if a view is essential to your experience, you may need to inquire at the desk or go elsewhere. U shaped pool with 3 and 4 foot sections were perfect for our sprites. Small gameroom is there, and I saw the exercise area but did not get a chance to look at it. I believe there was a new Starbucks about 2 blocks away along with a CVS pharmacy. Metro is about 4 blocks. All in all, it was a good experience and with only one day to spend, so I took no chances. About $145 with AAA. Hard to beat.

<Content>Excellent choice for business or leisure travel I stay at this hotel on a regular basis for business travel to Washington. The hotel is conveniently located (about 3 blocks from Dupont Circle and the Metro), the staff is friendly and accomodating, and the suites are comfortable and well laid out. The 32'' flat screen tv in the living room area is a definate plus. Like all Embassy Suites this hotel offers an excellent breakfast buffet and cooked to order items (eggs, omelets, etc) and an evening cocktail reception, both of which are fantastic. The Dupont Circle area offers a number of dining options and DC attractions are only a few stops away on the Metro (about a 5-10 minute ride).

<Content>great for kids too I stayed here just before Christmas vacation with my mom and 2 yr old daughter after reading Trip Advisor recommendations.I'm well traveled and thought it was great value all round. Rooms were big enough for 4 of us (hubbie included.)We enjoyed the pool and kids video game area, the evening drinks reception, huge breakfasts and feeding the fish in the pool.The hotel staff were extremely friendly - from the restaurant giving us some milk at night to the lady overseeing the evening reception.Only (small) complaint was the trek to the metro and the dark lobby. Again tho, excellent job all round, a real treasure. would go back in a shot.

<Content>Very Practical for the Business Traveler I passed two nights here while I visited Washington, D.C. on business. This property was very clean and quiet and offered great value. The machines in the gym here are newer than the equipment I used at the Embassy Suites in the Chevy Chase Pavillion, where I spent 30 nights last summer. My organization organized an evening cocktail in a private room here and this worked out extremely well. The only disadvantages are a) the location of the metro. The nearest station, Dupont Circle, is about 4 blocks away; and b) the business center computer terminals are a bit slow during peak hours. Nonetheless, the hotel itself is in all respects excellent and I would recommend this property to any traveler.

<Content>An 2008 Embassy Suites Here for business, I'm glad to see Embassy Suites move out of the Green and white life! Plasma TV's make the difference in the rooms, breakfast (free at ES) was fab as usual at this chain. I saw the bill which went to my employer.. Yikes! Oh well.

<Content>It's a solid 3.5 star hotel...and a great deal We stayed at the Embassy Suites for one night - 1/5/08. It is a very good hotel. Hotel is located in DC's West End, with close proximity to Georgetown and Dupont Circle.Since we were parking for a weekend night (Saturday), we pulled around to park in the hotel parking garage and the valet pointed out there were a couple of spots for free available right on the street in front of the hotel - SO nice of him! We parked for free for the night right in front of the hotel and saved the $24 per car. The parking spaces are apparently good until 7 am Monday morning. Great start to our day/night in DC!Check-in was quick and they accomodated our group of 9 with 2 rooms directly next to each other on the 9th floor. Rooms are all suite-style with a living room - sofa bed, dining room table, plasma TV, fridge, microwave, coffeemaker, sink in the living room, coffee table - all were in very good condition. Bathroom is normal size for a hotel room and was clean, but not luxurious. Sink, toilet, shower/tub combo - however, the shower had low water pressure.Our bedroom had 2 queen beds with a sink in the bedroom as well (that is 3 sinks overall in the suite!) and another TV in the bedroom (not plasma, though.) Bed is reasonably comfortable. We had a nice view of the National Cathedral from our suite. Utilized the indoor pool and hot tub - fine, a little outdated, but suits small children just fine. Hot tub was nice and hot. There is also a sauna and a fitness room as well - entrance is via the 2nd floor.Breakfast is typical of all Embassy Suites - served buffet-style, complimentary and lots of choices. Made-to-order omlettes are a good bet - you choose the fillings. There are many choices, both hot and cold - eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon, muffins, bagels, cereals, pasteries, juices, coffee, grits, fresh fruit, yogurt, granola, etc...etc...you just can't go wrong with the ES breakfast. We also went to the complimentary manager's reception and they had 4 different beers on tap (Heineken included!) as well as preminum liquors (like Bacardi.) You can have as many drinks as you like from 5:30-7:30. Snacks are definitely munchies - chips and salsa, popcorn, pretzels, that kind of thing. They also had a movie playing right on top of the manager's reception for the kids - our evening they were showing Cars - great idea to keep the kids engaged. Every evening they change the choice of movie shown.We ordered room service for dinner from the hotel restaurant and this is the only thing I did not like about the hotel. The food was awful. I had shrimp alfredo and it was overcooked shrimp with barely any alfredo sauce, overcooked pasta and the entire dish was cold by the time I got it. Just awful. 3 of the 4 adults in our party ordered it and all of us felt the same way. The bruschetta I got as an appetizer was decent, however. Nonetheless, if I return to this property, I will avoid the hotel restaurant - really a bad meal. Our kids meals (we ordered 5 of them) were all cold and overcooked as well.Embassy Suites is always a great bang for the buck. I paid $135 for the night per room directly through the hotel website and for the free drinks, the free breakfast, the large suite-style rooms, the indoor pool and the overall kid-friendly atmosphere in a central DC setting, I probably couldn't do any better in terms of value for the dollar. I'd return without issue.

<Content>Excellent! Our singing group of 8 women traveled to Washington at the beginning of December. (We were singing at the White House.) We booked 3 rooms at the Embassy Suites.Upon arriving, we were greeted warmly at the desk, and were treated wonderfully by EVERY employee the entire duration of our stay. Everyone is friendly and helpful - we were just so blown away.In the middle of the first night, the hotel alarm went off and everyone had to head to the lobby. Again, the staff answered all questions and put people at ease. (False alarm.) The following morning the night manager circulated at breakfast, explaining why the alarm had gone off and asking everyone how they fared the night before.Speaking of breakfast - WoW! There is so much to choose from that I can't imagine anyone would go away hungry: hot and cold cereals, pancakes, waffles, bacon, eggs, made-to-order omelets, biscuits and gravy, fresh fruit, and much more... all included in the room rate.The rooms themselves were very clean and nicely decorated. The bedding is crisp, clean and comfortable. A few of us slept on the sofabeds and they are comfortable and clean, as well.Again, we were thrilled with the hotel and plan to stay there again if we return to Washington. ***One word of advice about the taxis...get a quote BEFORE you get in! The prices are supposed to be standardized, but we were charged widely different amounts for our day trips.

<Content>Good hotel, esp. for those with kids My husband and I stayed at the Embassy Suites Washington, DC for two nights for a getaway. The price was quite good. The hotel is in a wonderful location, in DuPont Circle but in a quiet area, within a 10-minute walk to the Georgetown Area. The gym was excellent for a hotel gym. The pool was nice, but the jacuzzi was broken. The hotel offers adult swim late, which is probably very nice. When we went to the pool, there were kids having fun, which was fun to watch but not good for relaxation. The breakfast was very good, however the cleaning staff will clear your place when you get up to get more food. The staff was all very nice. One problem: the room heat turns off automatically when you leave the room to conserve energy. This is very good for the enviornment, however, when we returne to our room, it was FREEZING. It took quite a while to warm up. The hotel is great for families with kids, b/c of the extra bed in the sofa in the suites and the refrigerator/microwave in the room. The kids there all seemed to be having fun. On the other hand, if you dislike children, you may want to consider another hotel.Overall, it was a good hotel and I would recommend it.

<Content>Perfect weekend getaway From the friendly staff to the luck of being placed in one of the larger suites, this was the perfect place for a girls' weekend getaway. My 2 friends and I felt extremely at ease in the neighborhood and walked everywhere! We did not dine on site, so I can't really say anything about the Italian restaurant except that it looked like a nice place and the menu prices seemed reasonable. The buffet was typical for ES, so no surprises there. The pool/jacuzzi area was also typical for ES, but not crowded with kids (possibly because of the time of year). It's a pleasant walk to Foggy Bottom metro station just a few blocks away if needed. Also, the hotel is about 4 or 5 blocks from Georgetown, so we visited there a couple of times for shopping and brunch at Martin's Tavern. No complaints at all about our suite, which was very large, very clean and had comfortable beds. Great exercise facility on site!My only gripe is that the jacuzzi/pool maintenance is performed at a time of morning when I wanted to use those facilities. It would be nice if it could be done during the hours when that area is closed to guests.This was my first time visiting DC, and I look forward to the day I can return. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Perfect! We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and we do not have a single complaint. The room was spacious, clean, and well kept. The facility overall was very clean. The complimentary breakfast was good, and the complimentary cocktails at the nightly managers reception were great. The single thing that made this hotel shine was the staff. This was the friendliest staff I have ever seen, not even one sour face. I could go on and on, but I'll say this - I was attending a conference at another hotel (very well known and high end hotel) so to stay at the Embassy Suites we had to walk to the metro, take the metro, then walk to the other hotelin 32 degree weather. Next year when we go to the conference - we'll do it again. We would not stay anywhere else.

<Content>Good for families First and foremost, this hotel is great for families. And that is why it's packed with families. If you really don't like children and want a peaceful breakfast, I recommend staying elsewhere.The breakfast was great, particularly for a family. The buffet was wonderful and the coffee nice and strong the way we like it. Watching the carp swim in the pools while eating breakfast is a lot of fun with young children.The restaurant on site has terrible service and I don't recommend it because of that reason only. The food was actually decent, if they remember to bring it to you. We went twice and regretted it twice. Other families had the same problems on different days so it wasn't just an isolated experience.The pool was fun for the kids and they also show movies in the afternoon for kids. Given the outreach to families, I wonder why they don't have a separate play area for younger kids. It would help keep them from running around the atrium.As a gold vip, I can tell you that there are no additional perks worth discussing (I did get two bottles of water, but for a 4 night stay, that's not much). Not even late checkout when I tried. Kevin or Keith (sorry, I can't remember his name correctly) is a wonderful bellman who is friendly to the kids and adults alike.

<Content>Big rooms, great location Stayed there for a couple of nights. We chose this hotel based on the TripAdvisor ranks. Although we were expecting a little bit more, we were generally satisfied with this hotelRooms are big (suites) and clean. Great bed (king size). Location is excellent: close to Dupont Circle and the metro station. Breakfast (included in the rate) was good, although they could have better selection of fruits and cheese. We just thought the front desk staff was not that friendly and the hotel in general was a little rundown. But overall, for the price/value ratio, it is a good choice.

<Content>Loved the Beds! We were guests, and were treated to a non-smoking suite. The room was very nice, with a wide screen plasma tv, a couch, desk, microwave and fridge ... all very nice.The bedroom was very nice and the bed was delighhhhhtful.. it had a down-like comforter and lots and lots of pillows. It was very high off the floor, so when you are all wrapped up on the bed, you feel very cuddly and safe.The staff were very friendly, the restaurant is very pricey ... in fact, the is one of the first hotels I've experienced where room service is less expensive than the restaurant. I wish I had realized that sooner in our stay.There's a manager's cocktail hour from 5:30-7:00 every night (never attended) and a nice breakfast buffet that isn't as wonderful as other places, but it's certainly fine to get the day started--I'm guessing kids would like it, too.The business center is down in the basement which was a bit inconvenient, but there is an Internet kiosk in the hotel lobby to sign on and check your email or surf the web.All in all, very nice.

<Content>Can't beat the price and location For less than what you would pay for in other hotels in the area, you get to have a suite for you and your family. That's why we booked this place, because it is all suites and they provide you with evening reception (of snacks and drinks) and breakfast which is all complimentary to our booking. Just breakfast itself saved the 4 of us at least $30-40 a day, and after 4 days of doing this, the savings does add up. Something of note though for the drinks. The other embassy suites I have visited did not have limitations as what kind of drinks I am allowed/not allowed to order, but the lady who was making drinks during my stay told me that something as simple as long island ice tea could not be made for free due to management policy, whatever the heck that means. All the other Embassy Suites provides me with the drink I want!The rooms are exactly as expected from an Embassy Suites. A small mini-bar/sink is in the livingroom area, which helped in the 4 of us getting ready in the morning a bit quicker. The sofa does convert to a sofabed which helped in providing more room to sleep in.One thing I noticed at our stay though is, because I am a Hilton HHonors member, we were given the 9th floor (top floor) of this building which was designated as a HHonor floor. I don't know if this how it's arranged at all other Embassy Suites, but the floor was less crowded with people, the views better, and it just felt good to be on that floor. Good job.You do pay for your parking at this place, but you really don't need a car from here. Subway stations are all walking distance, and if you do want to come back to your hotel from any place in DC, just take the cab. Parking within DC for travelers is a mess, and it's not worth the headache. Just use mass transit.My only gripe with this hotel was also the breakfast. I found moldy white bread in the bread dispensers, which I notified the staff members. They quickly took away my bread, but did not check through all the other white bread within the dispenser to make sure they weren't moldy. I did a quick take on the bread, and they seemed to be ok, but it would have been more reassuring if the bread was checked again by staffers.I would stay here again. Besides the moldy bread incident and the alcohol limitations, I had a great time. We paid $159 + tax per night btw.

<Content>Watch the doors Decent, convenient, place to stay in DC, even though it was ridiculously expensive when we were there ($350 per night). However, we were staying for a week and nothing else in the area had availability.Although there were a good amount of business travelers staying in the hotel, it is primarily a family hotel, as many of the ES tend to be.Typical Embassy Suites with the breakfast in the am, and the cocktails in the pm. Good gym with modern machines. Fast room service and nice people working at the hotel. Negatives are the $10 per night internet charge and lack of an in-room safe.My one big problem was I came back one day and my door was open, apparently the maid had not closed the door tightly enough when he or she finished cleaning the room. Although nothing was stolen (I took everything with me due to a lack of above mentioned in-room safe), it gave me a major heart attack. The mechanism that keeps the door from slamming shut (see above mentioned kid friendly remark) also keeps the door from closing securely without a solid effort.

<Content>Great Hotel! Good Location! I stayed at the Embassy Suites in Washington DC from October 10th until October 12th 2007. This is the Embassy Suites around M and 22nd Street - not to be confused with Embassy Suites Convention Center. I did not stay there.I would stay at this hotel again. It was great. We had a very large room with a queen bed. 2 tvs, one in the bedroom and one in the lounge area. A large eating table which would double as a work desk. A good sized bathroom and 3 sinks! one in the bathroom, a bar sink in the lounge and another sink in the bed room. There was a bar fridge, coffee maker and I think a microwave as well. The room was very clean and the service was excellent. you can self park on the property as well which we did and it has in and out privilages. there is free internet access in the hotel - so even if you don't bring your notebook with you there are kiosks in the reception area you can use. There is a decent gym too.I was pleased with the room and with the service. they called us when we got to the room to ask us if everything was ok. Our fridge started to leak so I called down and they came up immediately, changed the sink and dried the carpet for us.you get a free breakfast which you have lots to choose from. I'm a picky breakfast eater so I wasn't nuts about what they had but I still found something. they have fruit, yougurt, hard boiled eggs, cooked to order omlets (I found them kind of greesy and the mushrooms are canned so I didn't care for it), make your own waffles, pancakes, cereal, juice, bacon, scrambled eggs, etc. Location wise, this place is great. you're close to Dupont circle metro and close to Foggy Bottom. you're walking distance from George Town were all the stores are. you're walking distance from the white house too. Actually we walked to all monuments - some were a bit of a far walk but it's doable (could be up to a 45 min to 1 hr walk). But if you don't want to walk to some of those further sites, pop on the metro and you're there in minutes.In terms of food, I read one comment that there wasn't much around there. Actually there is lots of food around there, you need to stay on M street there is lots of food there.

<Content>"ArizonaTraveler77" Hit it right Have to ditto the previous review on the Embassy Suites. Nice and clean, fine breakfast, and close to the Metro. Very prompt maid service. Also, our first time in DC, with kidz 16,13, and 11... (Think I met Arizona and her family there). Anyway, for the price in DC, location, close to Georgetown and George Washington U. The place is very good. Big enough for 5, as long as you are not in the room too long together. Smallish pool shaped like a U. But free computer terminals to check e-mail, print boarding passes, etc. Would definately stay there again.

<Content>Perfect family hotel with a great location Based on reviews we read in Trip Advisor for families travelling with children, we chose the Embassy Suites hotel on 22nd Street (Foggy Bottom area) in Washington DC. We could not have been happier with our choice! We were travelling with our 3 children ages 16, 13, and 6 who had never been to Washington before. The hotel was in a fantastic neighborhood location, a short and easy walk to the subway and with plenty of neighborhood restaurants nearby. We like to use local transportation when we travel, so this was a real plus. Since the room had a seperate living area (with a sofa sleeper), it gave the 5 of us plenty of room to spread out. The room was nicely decorated and very clean. One of the best features, especially from a family perspective is the free breakfast...not a continental breakfast, but a full buffet with lots of choices. They managed to feed a huge number of people, but kept everything stocked and clean. The staff at the hotel was excellent as well, very service oriented and willing to answer all our questions, in fact, one of the bellman took us under his wing and explained the whole subway system to us in detail, which was a big help! We will definitley stay here again and would recommend the hotel to anyone travelling to Washington DC.

<Content>The Perfect Place! I go to this wonderful hotel every year for my annual girls' road trip with some girlfriends and co-workers - and we have never failed to be delighted! While it looks very non-descript from the outside, The Embassy Suites at Dupont Circle is MAGNIFICENT inside: coy pond, water falls, plants and an amazing open atrium make it a hotel that you can just relax in... the lobby is unlike any other hotel I've ever stayed at! It is just beautiful!Plus, there's a free breakfast (which is GREAT) each morning and a free cocktail party each night.. The hotel has gone through some upgrades recently, too: there's now a waffle maker at breakfast, some extra munchies at the cocktail party and free internet access. Also, we got a call from the hotel restaurant (where we ordered a very nice pizza from) asking if we liked the food. There are just so many nice touches to this hotel - they are TOTALLY customer service oriented. Don't forget your swim suit - there's a lovely indoor pool, too, with a hot tub!

<Content>So Glad I Read Trip Advisor The reviews for this hotel are all true and very helpful so I won't repeat everything so far. My husband and I took our 2 daughters in their 20s....we got a jr.executive suite with 2 queens in the bedroom and a queen sofa bed in the living room....gave the girls the bedroom and slept on the sofa bed which was ok but could use a feather topper on it....Chinese restaurant 2blks away was a bomb...don't go to Meiwah(we are from SF with great Chinese food)...also found out on the last night of our 9 day stay there is a $1 bus that runs every 15 minutes to Georgetown...so after walking all day its nice to ride there...ate at Clyde's and JPauls in Georgetown, at Old Ebbitts Grill by the White House(great) and BSmith's at Union Stations...very fun.....HOTEL is the best for families....we booked thru website of hotel at $330 and the week before we left got $280 on Priceline thru the trip advisor website........never wrote a review before but this was such great advice I had to!!!!!!The friendliest city we have ever been to outside of Ireland....GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Highly recommend this Embassy Suites! We stayed here for 4 nights (9/29-10/2/07) while visiting Washington DC. We both loved the hotel which is within a 10 minute walk to either the Dupont Circle (Red line) or the Foggy Bottom (Blue or Orange line) metro stations. The room was lovely - we had a corner suite and it had 2 flat screen TVs, one of which was HD, a dining table, wet bar, microwave, refrigerator, coffeemaker, good sized bathroom and king bed. The free breakfast was great - made to order omelets, plus a large buffet selection of grits, potatoes, eggs, bacon, sausage, bagels, rolls, cereals, oatmeal, fruit, danish, a large variety of juices, soft drinks, coffee, tea, etc.. We ate a large breakfast each day then skipped lunch which saved us a lot of money! Every evening the manager's reception had FREE drinks - beer, wines, margaritas, strawberry daquiris, and various other liquers, along with pretzels, popcorn, potato chips and snack mix. It was a nice way to unwind from the long days we spent sightseeing. The hotel was in a very nice and safe area and we never felt nervous about walking to or from the hotel. The Chinese restaurant Meiwah is only 2 blocks away and it was one of the best meals we had in DC. I'd skip the restaurant in the hotel -- it wasn't all that good and it was fairly expensive. There is also a CVS store a few blocks away - hard to find so ask someone where it is if you want to get some water, soda, snacks, etc... All in all we had a lovely stay and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Washington for business or pleasure!

<Content>Best hotel on our trip! We were a group of friends travelling together and decided that a suite style accommodation would work best for us. This was truely the best value and experience we had on our trip! Newer hotel, nice flat screen (HD TV, I think!), and 3 sinks. The full breakfast (omlette  belgian waffle station plus a full breakfast buffet!) was situated in a beautiful atrium and paid for nearly half our hotel cost itself! Terrific service. On the last day, my friend accidently left her PJ's on the bed and they ended up being taken with the sheets. The housekeeping staff found it and put it with our luggage before we had to depart no problem. We totally recommend this hotel!

<Content>Great Location We have just returned from 10 days in Washington, this hotel was great and so was the location and the breakfast to. My only negative would have to be the kitchnette, which was a microwave, fridge and coffeemaker. There were no plates, knifes forks etc, so we couldn't really eat in as we had planned. That said there were plenty of cheap eating places near by particularly the Froggy Bottom Pub which was fantastic.

<Content>An excellent hotel in a good location Overall we had a lovely stay here. The good: - Rooms are very large- The main sleeping room is set back from the door so this is a very quiet hotel at nighttime- Free breakfast is excellent with order your own omlette- Staff are friendly and efficient- Managers reception very good value - you can pick the wine (from small list) and there are some good ones available. The snacks are just crisps, popcorn and natchos- Restaurant on site is good, a little more expensive than average but only what you would expect in a hotel - service is very quick. - Location good for day time - you can walk everywhere! Furthest away area of Capitol takes 45 mins good paced walking- Walkable to Georgetown - we found a lovely Italian restaurant - Papa Razzi - M Street and Wisconsin Av (15 mins walk with lots of choice and excellent service). The not so good: - At night there are restaurants within walking distance. However the only area we found with lots of choice was GeorgeTown. This is a 15 min walk away up M street. I have out this in the 'not so good' category as we didnt find lots of restaurants close by.

<Content>short DC visit Embassy Suites is in a great location - a 5-10 walk to Dupont Circle Metro. Property is well-maintained and the breakfast spread is excellent. Rooms are very clean and room service was quite timely. Food from on-site restaurant is above average as well. We also were quite pleased with the room rate for such a roomy well-located hotel. We will stay here every time we stay in D.C. One caution - the pool is small and crowded so you can't do much relaxing or actual swimming!

<Content>Nice Place Nice place, rooms large, lobby fine, employees helpful, can use computers in lobby or business office and print anything, close to Foggy Bottom, Dupont Circle, Georgetown. Easy walk to all those places even with baggage. Local restaurants were good, great variety, great breakfast and managers reception everynight with food and drinks included. I stayed here due to my conference being at the Fairmont and they are just too expensive. Enjoyed my stay and the DC party shuttle which gave good ideas on what to see.

<Content>Great Stay for our family I chose this hotel for two reasons. I think the Hilton brand hotels are the best and because of the reviews on Tripadvisor. I must say we were not disappointed! The room was large and clean and the staff was very friendly. The kids loved feeding the fish and the breakfast was awesome.

<Content>Family Family Family Hotel I will keep this short as there is a lot of information here already about this hotel that is pretty much correct. This is a highly ranked hotel for one reason! PRICE For the price I paid ($150 per night for a suite) it is the best value in DC for a family. Everything about this hotel is good or better (ie location, free food, pool and most important kid friendly). The only negatives were in room internet charges ($9.95) and parking ($28 - but it is a city location).Do not stay here if you do not have kids with you. It felt like a Orlando hotel located in DC.All in all, I was happy, my kids were happy and my bank account was happy.

<Content>Nice hotel and the Kids liked it It is a nice hotel for Families- the seperate bedroom and mini bar make it nice for a longer stay. The breakfast was nice and I really liked the free Happy hour. I will say it is a bit farther away than I would have liked. Too far for the younger kids to walk to the main attractions and not actually in Georgetown. The price was right and I guess that makes up for the distance. One issue was parking. The lot was full and my husband had a big hike down to the Ritz to park the car. Funny part was they did not even discount the parking rate. Tthe other draw back is the pool- it is awfull. So small and so crowded, yuck. DC really needs a nicer family oriented hotel with a nice pool.In the future I would stay a little closer to the monuments.

<Content>Great family hotel - not for business We had a very good stay here and would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling with kids. Just a couple issues worth noting. The business center was overrun with children playing computer games all the time. That made it impossible to use a computer when needed. I need to stay in touch with work even on vacation (as most people do I expect.) I access my email on my blackberry, but cannot print and find it difficult to read long messages which show up as attachments. There are standup computer stations throughout the lobby, but those did not solve my printer problem. I guess the long and short is that I think business centers should be for business, and the family slant of this hotel means there are no 18 and over rules for the business center. It was a relatively minor inconvience for me, but if I had been travelling on business it would have been a huge problem. In a similar vein, we had a lot of delays caused by tween kids having races in the elevators. One last thing - I called the concierge the second night of our four night stay for dinner reservation assistance and had to leave a voice mail ... I am still waiting for a call back. All in all, for a family trip at well under $300 a night it was just fine. Delightful personnel (the woman who cleans up during breakfast is one of the nicest service workers I have encountered in a long time!) The room was nice and the breakfast was the best free breakfast I have ever had at a hotel.

<Content>Great family hotel Our family of 6 stayed at this Embassy Suites for 2 nights and we were all really impressed with the property. The suite was clean, spacious, had a flat screen t.v. in the living room and included everything you need - from ironing board to coffee maker. The hotel provides both breakfast (omelettes, waffles, etc.) and a manager's reception in the evening with snacks, soft drinks and complimentary cocktails. They even had a movie for the kids each night.The hotel is a little far from D.C. attractions, but the metro station is a short walk and was a pleasure to ride.Next time we head back to Washington, we will definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>second time at Embassy Suites This was our second stay at this Embassy Suites having stayed last September as well. We knew what to expect and we were not disappointed. The hotel was naturally busy being summer school holidays and sometimes it was difficult to get seated at breakfast but otherwise everything OK. One of the three lifts was not working so it was a bit frustrating getting up and down to the 8th floor! Front staff were very helpful. We find this location very good - close enough but not too close to the famous locations. The nearby metro system is first class and we recommend the shopping centre at Pentagon City which is easy to get to on the metro.The hotel rooms are now beginning to look a bit tired...the bathroom in particular had some grimy areas.Overall this hotel offers good value for money and good service.

<Content>DC GETAWAY Stayed here for 3 days in August with a family of five. The hotel is in a nice safe area of Washington DC, just north of the George Washington University campus. There were 2 other hotels on the same block, a Marriott and Ritz Carlton. The suite was a standard room for Embassy Suites hotels, with a good size living room area that had the pull out sofa bed and 2 double beds in the bedroom. The room was very clean, but had a bit of old and new in it. The living room had a flat screen TV with HD, while the bedroom had a standard one. Sinks had granite tops, but the tub/shower and toilet were dated and a bit beat up. The decorating was a late 80's, early 90's vibe, but overall for the price, compared to other DC properties it was well worth it. The breakfast buffet had a nice spread, but I agree with other reviewers that it was crowded and not easy to find a seat. I saw many people taking their trays up to their rooms. The restaurant in the hotel Nicolas was a solid choice if you don't feel like going back out for dinner after a day of sightseeing.Please note that the hotel is quite a ways from the major attractions. Walking to them is possible, but we mixed in cabs with the walking. There are 2 Metro stations nearby, but we figured with a 12, 9, and 4 year old with a stroller, cabs would be easier than lugging everybody to a train.Overall a pleasant stay and a solid hotel. The atrium interior was also fun for the kids, as they got a kick out of the fish. It probably shouldn't be rated #2 overall in DC, but definetely #1 for families looking to visit Washington.

<Content>Great family hotel, good location Satyed at this hotel for 6 nights with my husband and two chldren (9 and 13). Didn't have a car, as we were flying to our next destination, so parking not an issue.Lovely big rooms with a sitting room complete with flat screen television plus television in bedroom. Breakfast was excellent and queues not enormous. Children stocked themselves up for the day and we saved a fortune! Manager's Happy Hour between 5pm-7pm was a great way to relax at the end of a busy day. Films were shown for the children, plus popcorm and soft drinks, whilst the adults could choose from a whole range of alcoholic beverages and snacks. Easy 5 minute walk to metro which has to be the simpliest metro system to navigate that I have come across and very cheap. Only about a 20 minutes walk to White House and 10 min walk to Georgetown which is lovely - good shops and restaurants. Area felt very safe to walk around.Would certainly choose this hotel again.

<Content>Great stay at the Embassy Suites Family of 6 with 4 kids stayed here and just got back today. Hotel was wonderful in every way. We squeezed into an Executive 2 Queen bed suite. They were gracious enough to allow us to do that. Usually only 5 per room. The hotel was excellent, room was super clean and roomy, breakfast was great ( and included with your room). The restaurant onsite Nicola's was great too. Wonderful food. Pool is very small but we found that in the middle of the day when it was too hot for our kids to be out...everyone else was out...and we were alone in the pool. Cocktail hour snacks are nothing big (popcorn and chex mix) but they do serve free drinks..pretty much anything you ask for. Overall...excellent stay....great for families.

<Content>Very good but crowded On the strength of Tripadvisor recommendations, we stayed at the Embassy Suites at the end of July.It was generally very good but just a little tooooo popular! They provide complimentary breakfast as well as a complimentary happy hour. At breakfast, we initially found it difficult to get a table for our group. To the hotel's credit, they spotted this problem for us and for many others and extended the breakfast serving times by an hour. Breakfasts were then okay although still crowded.Our suite was very good indeed although somewhat formulaic. I was disappointed at their daily $9.95 charge for internet access but particularly enjoyed playing with the high definition tv in the room. It was very useful to have a fridge and microwave in the room as well.Like breakfast, happy hour was served in the large atrium which forms the centre of the hotel. This was very pleasant but lacked the tranquility one might hope for. This was partly due to the many excited small kids and teenagers running around (well, it IS a family hotel) and also to the 2 storey tall water feature. This had waterfalls which made a lot of noise. That coupled with the general hubbubb made for a fairly noisy environment. We were glad of the air conditioning in this area though!There is also a pool and fitness centre. We did not use these facilities, having tramped around the Washington sights all day. There are two coin operated laundries in the hotel but these were also very popular. It was difficult to get a time slot. The hotel also offers a document printing service. I did not use it so I do not know if there is a charge for this.The front desk was generally very good and it was possible to check out automatically without having to queue up to settle our bill. That was well organised.For location, the Embasy Suites is not too bad. It is situated in an inner suburb of Washington but not immediately near any centres. The two nearest metro stops are Dupont Circle and Foggy Bottom. Both are around ten minutes away in foot. The historic and very picturesque area of Georgetown is also an easy stroll and there are very many good restaurants there. It is possible to walk to the White House and nearby attractions in around half an hour to 45 minutes. Washington's public transport system is good, cheap, clean and modern and gives good access to these areas.All in all, we would agree with the good ratings. It was a busy, well run hotel but we were uncomfortable with just how crowded it was. That said, it was well managed and operated and they coped with the hordes of people very well.

<Content>Very Happy With this Embassy Suites This was our third time at this Embassy suites and we were very pleased. the front desk staff and manager were excellent and after loosing my key a couple times remembered my name and laughed with me about it. they make you feel very welcome at this hotel which is in a very safe area of D.C. We have always felt safe walking around this area at night. The front desk staff know the directions anywhere and the best places to go. They are truly trained well.Breakfast and happy hour get very busy here, but everything is fresh and they serve great drinks at happy hour. From frozen margaritas to bottled beer they don't go as cheap as I have seen other Embassy Suites do. The soft drink station also has a huge selection including powerade and an energy drink. One morning I brought my breakfast tray to the room because lack of seating, but found this to be enjoyable.We enjoyed the equipment in the exercise room and it was always kept clean and filled with water and towels.Some people may wonder how can an Embassy Suites be the #2 hotel in D.C, and i think even though the property is not the Four Seasons, the overall customer service and value lead to a great D.C. deal.

<Content>Really Enjoyed the Embassy Suites - 22nd St NW The staff was very friendly and helpful from the moment we checked in. Our room was ready when arrived in the early afternoon on a Friday.This is a family friendly hotel, so be prepared for lots of kids. We had the breakfast buffet every morning. Note if you want the made to order omlettes, you need to get downstairs early. The later you go down, the longer the omlette line. There is a wide variety in the buffet with many hot entrees to choose from without having to wait in the omlette line.Prime times during the breakfast buffet and cocktail reception, elevators are slow. There are 3, but during prime time you have to wait for an elevator. If you stay here and are on floors 3 and 2, do yourselves and fellow guests on the upper floors a favor and get some exercise by walking down the stairs!Rooms were always cleaned in a timely manner. We really enjoyed the food at the italian restaurant in the hotel. Loved having the computer kiosks in the lobby so that we could print our boarding passes the night before we left.We were able to walk to the Metro stops and if you walk over to M Street you will find McDonald's, Chipotle, Cosi, etc. Otherwise restaurants in the area can be relatively pricey for a family.

<Content>Perfect for Family Perfect for a family looking for a place to stay. It is four blocks from a Metro station and easy walking with luggage. The staff was very helpful and courteous. Trust their recommendations-they never steered us wrong. The breakfast in the mornings is hot and fresh with a wide variety of foods. Perfect way to start a day. The rooms were clean and nice size. The fitness room is great with individual TVs on each piece. Book early-there is a reason it fills up fast.

<Content>We had a wonderful stay here! We just spent a week in Washington, DC at the Embassy Suites and it was fabulous! There were 4 of us, my husband and I plus our two teenage daughters. We stayed in an executive suite (I think that's what they called it). It had a bedroom with two queen size beds and then a living room/kitchenette room with a nice TV and a sofa bed. (The girls took turns on the sofa bed.) We were very comfortable. It was very conveniently located right in the middle between Dupont Circle and George Washington University. The breakfast buffet was nice but I recommend you get up early to eat because it gets really busy after 8am. The manager's reception is kind of lame. Popcorn, chips and salsa. Not too much fun if you're not a drinker. We didn't really spend time in the pool. We live in Florida so pools aren't a big deal for us. We ate at the hotel restaurant one night and it was okay; nothing spectacular but everything tasted fairly good. We were in DC for the 4th and that was great fun! We stayed away from the Mall and watched the fireworks sitting in front of the Federal Reserve building. It was the perfect spot, no crowds! The hotel staff was very friendly and met our every need. The cleaning staff was great, too. We came home to nice, clean rooms every night. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Awesome for families, great experience! Great place to stay to see the sites of Washington. Breakfast is included, but the lines can get long, and if you are a businesss traveller you might get annoyed with all the children running around. The Manager's reception was terrific too. Drinks and munchies from 5:30 to 7 was a great way to end the day.We wen to Famous Luigi's for a pizza dinner and loved it. Highly recommend for the price vs. quality.

<Content>Great hotel My wife and I ( both 60+) spent 4 nights here in mid June. The hotel was really excellent and would be great for families as well as couples. Suites were spacious with excellent facilities The breakfasts in the atrium were an additional bonus. Dupont Circle was only a short walk away so getting around the city by bus or metro was easy. A very good base in a quiet area, which we would strongly recommend, but don't try to walk to the White House - it's a long long way!

<Content>Pretty nice.... PROS:Kids will love it. They can feed the fish in the hotel lobby. Was notnoisey, since the sleeping room is one room removed from the hallway.Fast elevators. Breakfast was above average for a continental. Never had a problem finding a seat for either the breakfast or evening cocktail reception.CONS:Pool is too small, although we usually used it during odd hours and the crouds we lower then. The cocktail reception has chips and other bar-basket food....no real hors d'ouvres. Parking for us was off siteabout a block and a half away (since the on-site garage was full) with no valet service, and expensive at $23 per day.Overall, a good place for families, but expensive (like all Washington hotels).

<Author>STUNTS4FILM
<Content>Look no place else Let me begin by telling you that I researched hotels in DC for about 6 months before traveling there so it's safe to say I looked into most of the big name hotels. I got a travelers guide from the Visitors Bureau and looked at each and every hotel in their book.The Embassy Suites isn't right for everyone but it fit our needs perfectly and may fit yours as well.We were traveling with our children ages 12 and 15 so we wanted enough room to allow them privacy and have a place for us to unwind after a day of walking so the idea of a suite was a must for us. The Embassy Suites offer a true suite design with a bedroom that is totally seperate from the living room. Some of the suites we looked at were actually just a larger room than a normal hotel room and perhaps had a sitting area so don't be fooled by what some hotels call a suite.Prices will certainly vary depending on the time of year and the occupancy level but we paid $309 per night and was glad to pay it. Other hotels with similar rooms were almost twice this rate.OUTSIDE APPEARANCE: 3 The outside of the ES is nothing to catch your eye but who cares! There are many eye catching hotels in DC but unless you plan on sitting on the curb and admirring the brick work for hours, the outside isn't that important. The drive was clean and the bellmen were dressed nicely and always helpful.LOBBY: 3 Again...who cares. It's nothing to look at. The Concierge is to your left at a small desk and was VERY helpful and friendly. We were greeted within minutes and were checked in less than 5 . The staff were always smiling and friendly...every day.ATRIUM: 5 Near the elevators is the center atrium and it is very nice. There are small waterfalls and beautiful fish that surround the gift shop area with tables and chairs for relaxing at the Managers Special in the evening.ROOM: 5 Our room was nicely decorated, had a flat screen TV, was full of amenitites and the maid service did a WONDERFUL job cleaning it each day. It was big enough to utilize the pull out sofa AND add a roll-away if you wanted to. We had the King Corner suite and I would recommend getting that for the few extra dollars just because it is off-set in the corner and a bit more secluded and perhaps a bit quieter. The King bed was very comfortable, water pressure was good, never ran out of hot water. I did notice something that another reviewer mentioned: the tap water seems a bit warm at all times but aside from brushing my teeth, I never used the tap water. We bought a case of water at CVS and kept it in the refrigerator. The room was very quiet. We were on the 3rd floor but never noticed any traffic noise or the neighbors.FREE BREAKFAST: 5+ How can you go wrong with this. We ate the free breakfast for 4 days in a row. Never had to wait and the food was great! Juice, coffee, omelets, waffles, becon, fresh fruit.... for a family of 4 each meal would have cost about $30-35 and it would have taken more time out of our day. This was a huge factor in our decision to stay at the ES and it was a BIG pay-off.EVENING MGRS SPECIAL:  Can't really rate this because we only did it once. We had some popcorn and a few chips but neither of us drink alcohol so it wasn't a big thing for us. If you do like a cocktail or 2, this is a very neat thing. For 2 hours you are treated to FREE drinks! I noticed several people who seemed to be enjoying this special but for us.... it just wasn't that big of a deal.POOL: 3 Yes...it's true. It's small. If you are looking for a hotel to lay by the pool... look elsewhere. It's indoors, it's small, and it's full of kids. But that didn't stop us from enjoying the hottub. After a day of walking in DC, that hot tub felt pretty good and it's usually a good place to meet some interesting people. LOCATION: 4 There is a CVS pharmacy right around the corner to pick up sodas and snacks and anything you may have forgotten. The guy at the register was stoned out of his mind the first day we were there but at least we got some drinks and snacks.We always used the Foggy Bottom Metro and it's only about 4 blocks away. The walk always felt safe.I looked at many of the other hotels that I researched and considered while I was in DC and I can honestly say that have NO regrets for chosing the Embassy Suites downtown. The manager greeted us daily by name the place was always clean and neat.If you have any questions about traveling to DC...feel free to give me a shout and hopefully I can help.

<Content>Great value for the money We stayed here in June for a long weekend to do some sight-seeing with our family of six (age range of kids - 8 to 20). All in all, an excellent experience for the price paid, especially if traveling with kids. This was a typical Embassy Suites in terms of service (i.e., adequate, not excellent), but for the price, I think it was what I expected. The suite was very clean and nicely decorated, with plenty of room for all of us. The breakfast each morning was very good, with lots of selection. The hotel was very crowded, and the staff did a good job keeping things stocked and clearing tables. We never had to wait for a table. We attended the cocktail hour once, which was nice. We also went to the Italian restaurant once for dinner (Saturday night -- -we had not made reservations anywhere becuase we tried to go to ESPN Zone, but the wait for that was over 2 hours, so we decided to try the hotel restaurant). It was a bit over-priced, but the staff was friendly and everyone enjoyed the food. Not the best meal to be found in DC, but if you find yourself without a reservation, I would definately suggest trying it. As I said above, the hotel was very crowded, but I did not notice any noise once we were in our suite. The location is great -- a short walk to two different Metro lines, which gave us flexibility. Walking distance to Dupont Circle, where we ate a few meals and did some shopping. Really, the only negative that I can think of is that every morning the maid opened the door without knocking (the chain was always on, so she never came all the way in, but it was a disturbing way to be woken every morning!). Over all, a great stay for a great price if you are not expecting anything too fancy.

<Content>Loved Embassy Suites!! We had a great time at the Embassy Suites. The service was great! Our room was ready early and the breakfast and happy hour is awesome! The hotel is in walking distance of the metro and is a few blocks away from Georgetown. The area was safe and we felt comfortable walking around. We loved all the shops and places to eat in Georgetown. The rooms were clean and nice. We liked the fact that you had a bedroom and living room. Also, they had a coffee maker in the room with both coffee and tea. They also gave you shaving cream, razors, and toothpaste if you needed them. My husband and I would stay at this hotel again. Everyone was very nice and we enjoyed our time in D.C. and at the Embassy Suites!

<Content>Great Place in the Downtown Stayed here for 8 nights for convention in May/June of 2006. Brought along my wife and 14 year old son. Suite was great and in excellent condition. Had in-room safe that was very handy. Fair number of children about, but this was not unexpected. Still pretty quiet and could not hear my neighbors through the walls. Free cooked breakfast was nice. I staged a luncheon at the restaurant for 15 folks and was given a private room at no extra charge. Happy hour in the late afternoon was also good.In room internet costs, but there is a free internet kiosk in the lobby. This is a super location for those going to the new Washington Convention Center and there are many very good restaurants within a short walking distance. Put on your walking shoes to get to the Smithsonian museums (or taxi it). Overall a great experience. Worth every penny.

<Content>rooms are great but I hope you like kids...and noise Stayed here for 8 nights in in May and June and while we loved the rooms we were a bit shocked at the amount of children and the unruly behaviour allowed by their parents.Standing in line to get breakfast for 5-6 minutes may not be everybody's idea of a good time either and we only tried the afternoon free drinks thing once because of the wait at the bar and the chaotic behaviour of the children.The hotel itself is great...and if you've got kids it probably makes sense to stay there... If you like your hotel to be more serene and ordered think before booking in here.The italian restaurant attached to the hotel was a highlight and has delightful food and service.

<Content>Perfect for Sightseeing Families Our family of 5 stayed for one night. We were in D.C. for a college graduation and some quick sightseeing. The location is the hotel's biggest asset. We walked almost everywhere. The staff were very accommodating with restaurant recommendations and directions. The rooms and amenities were exactly as advertised, but I've stayed in better-maintained Embassy Suites. The Sunday breakfast service was severely understaffed -- some items didn't get replenished for ages. We didn't use the pool, but it was extremely small.

<Content>Great location, great service, great hotel I stayed at the hotel this past weekend and had ANOTHER wonderful experience. The staff was friendly and VERY accomodating. The atmosphere is great and the bright open lobby on a sunny day makes you feel like you are on a vacation in a tropical island. I have stayed here about five times now and wouldn't stay anywhere else.

<Content>great location Stayed for 5 nights with our 15 yr old son and was not disappointed. Location great, starbucks outside so I was happy! Suite really huge, we had two double bds in one room but plenty of space. British airways lost all our luggage so we had nothing to check in. Reception staff really great and gave us loads of toiletries to put us on. Complimentary b'fast good. Get there early though as it gets crowded and not too well organizes for that many. Also avoid room service, total disaster. We ordered a meal one night and three hours later still not come! Staff admitted that was a major problem. Location great, we walked everywhere. Was pointless walking to metro as it was over halfway to most places! If I went to washington again, I would definately stay there.p.s pool very small!

<Content>Great room and fitness center We are a family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids) who just stayed here from Saturday through Wednesday. We had a corner king - bedroom, larger living room and dining area. This is a great room with kids and worth the extra cost. Because the dining area is the room you enter by the door, both the bedroom and living room are away from the door and any hallway noise. Though the room needs a full length mirror.We flew in early morning, but went to the hotel to drop off our luggage. They were very nice about storing our luggage and even invited us to have breakfast (not sure if that was because we were gold members, but it was appreciated!)The fitness center is the nicest of any hotel I have been to and I have traveled a lot lately. All new Precor ellipticals, treadmills and a bike each with their own tv monitors and headphones - also weights, mats, fitness balls. The pool is small, but not too many DC hotels have pools. Only complaint was that the bike was missing the headphone jack and both the pool area and fitness center need clocks. In the pool area, people kept asking other people for the time.The breakfast was typical of Embassy Suite hotels (great variety and nicely spread out) plus you actually fill an individual bowl with your desired omelette fillings and then they make it. There seemed to be ample staff working, but they were not very quick at cleaning off tables and often forgot about the ones upstairs. The manager's reception offered a great variety of drinks and there were always 2 friendly ladies making the drinks. They also had fresh popcorn, pretzels, chips, salsa  jalapenos.The hotel is more like four blocks from the Foggy Bottom metro stop and little bit farther from Dupont Circle. We actually took the Metro from Reagan and walked with our suitcases from Foggy Bottom - not a bad walk in nice weather. You see a lot of people walking with suitcases and taking the metro. A 7 day pass is $22 and was well worth it.I would stay at this hotel again just for the fitness center alone - but they need to put a clock in there to keep me on schedule! The lobby internet stations are also very handy.

<Content>Definetly enjoyable, we'll be back ... Well, let me say I picked this hotel based on the review I read here, the price, the hotel photos/amenities and the price ... and I was not disappointed. Everything was bang on what we expected from the excellent breakfast buffet to the open-bar managers night reception. We really enjoyed the pool, hot tub and sauna as well. My only complaints (and these are minor) was that the internet kiosks they provide are painfully slow. I was very pleased they provided them at all but they were dreadfully slow. Seriously though, that was my biggest complaint. Service was very good and friendly, the hotel was clean (despite a bit of routine garage elevator maintenance), and that fact it is so close to everything is handy. We walked everywhere from the Caiptol Building to the Zoo and never had to take the Metro. Great job to the Embassy West ... we'll be back in about 3-4 years for sure but next time we're bringing family. Great hotel for kids as well.

<Content>Below Average Service Stayed in this hotel during Spring break. I found the front desk staff to be unfriendly and not very attendant. There were three staff members at the desk when we arrived but they seem more interested in talking amongst themselves rather than greeting a new guest. The concierge was also not very knowledgeable or helpful. My telephone was not working and I asked for a replacement but no one ever came to fix it. The maid also did not change the bed sheets on the pull out. I would only recommend this hotel to families with kids that were more concerned with large rooms and free breakfasts.

<Content>Embassy Suites good for families Our family of 4 went during Easter break. I agree with the reviews. The only problems I had were with the pool and the breakfast. The pool was too small and my kids said it was freezing. Usually we spend every vacation at the pool at some point during our day and we didn't because it was crowded and cold. The buffet in the morning was not for me because I am not a morning person and there were crowds and a mess most of the time. If you are an easy going person this might not bother you because it is afterall free!!!

<Content>Great stay at Embassy Suites Excellent location, great room, great breakfast -- we were pleasantly surprised by how nice the rooms were, and enjoyed use of the internet towers in the lobby. It was quite crowded since we were there over spring break, but the hotel dealt cheerfully and efficiently with huge crowds at breakfast -- food was quite decent and the coffee was really good, which is such a rarity at these places. I would recommend it whole heartedly to families.

<Content>Excellent family hotel We recently completed our second annual stay at this hotel, and both experiences were very good. Despite a few crowd related annoyances, the hotel is terrific and in a great location. We stayed in a corner suite which was extremely spacious, well decorated and comfortable. The bedroom was silent and the beds great. The hotel perks are truly remarkable and include a massive breakfast buffet, along with snacks and drinks in the evening, all included in the rate. The only drawback is that the hotel is a victim of it's own success as it seems to be overrun by kids during busy weeks, including an a pool too crowded to enjoy, and screaming kids in the hallways until 9 or 10 at night. Not a big problem, but something business travelers should be aware of. Otherwise, outstanding.

<Content>Perfect for Kids - Just visited Two families of 4 each travelled Friday night to Tuesday night in April. Very clean and nicely decorated rooms. Window in bedroom opens - which I love for fresh air. Three different mirror/sink areas to brush teeth/apply makeup makes it easy to get ready with 4 people in a room.Excellent hotel experience. All rooms open to courtyard and we liked that because if feels safer than long hallways - the older kids (we had two 9 year olds and two 12 year olds) could roam, go to the gift shop, ride the glass elevator, get snacks, etc. Free breakfast was yummy and saved us $$$ every morning for 8 people. Evening cocktail receiption/snacks reception was very nice too. Only drawback would be that the Metro is 4 blocks away so we hardly ever rode it - too far to walk in not-so-nice weather with exhausted kids- but the taxis run on a zone system so most rides to the major sites (the National Mall area, the Smithsonian, etc.) were only $11 or $14 for four of us each way. But even on our most active day it was only about $25 pp/day but we were saving so much money by having one room at the hotel instead of two and by not buying breakfast or drinks later... and taxis are everywhere in D.C. Staff helpful and nice. Remember to tip the ladies that pour the free drinks - they'll appreciate you!We ate at Nicola's (the private restaurant on-site) with the kids. It was very good and the service was excellent but it was pricey so be prepared. Also, if you like a nice glass of wine and the large no-name bottle at the free bar just isn't doing it for you, you can go into Nicola's and they have some nice wines by the glass. We will definitely look for Embassy Suites hotels on future trips.

<Content>Family Friendly But.... We stayed at the Embassy Suites the week after Easter 2007.The place was jammed with other families on Spring Break.There is a free breakfast buffet that comes with the room charge. The food is just average and the staff had a hard time keeping up with demand. There were long lines, empty serving dishes and the clean-up crew could barely keep up with the stacks of dirty dishes littering the tables. (This is not a criticism of the staff--they were obviously working very hard). There is a happy hour from 5:30-7:30p each day with free cocktails for parents and snacks for kids. Many parents seemed to stay out in the atrium enjoying their drinks while their kids swam in the nearby pool. The pool was tiny and crowded and many young kids were unsupervised. The chlorine smell was overwhelming.The staff could not keep up with the demand for towels.In the evening, it seems every family has a different idea of the best time for lights out. On Saturday night, there were two different groups of unsupervised young kids running wildly through the halls after 10pm. Neither the hotel management or the parents seemed very concerned about this behavior. Needless to say, that made it pretty tough for the rest of us to get to sleep!Bottom Line: Think twice about visiting D.C. at Spring Break. The crowds can be overwhelming both at the hotels and at the various sites around town.

<Content>Great for families with children, not so much for business stay Very good location for getting to many sights of DC, room was clean, recently renovated. Did not like having to pay so much for in room internet service, have stayed at DC hotels in the past where it is free. Our bedroom area was quiet, but hallway and living room noisy with constant running  yelling of children. Impossible to get a table at breakfast time, lots and lots of families with young children. Staff was friendly, helpful.

<Content>Easter Holiday We did much research online but with a family of 6 obtaining a single room is difficult. After reading some reviews online and with a knowldege of Embassy Suites we booked for $300 per night plus taxes. Positives: The breakfast buffet has something for everyone including Starbucks coffee. The cocktail hr was actually 2 hrs..much needed after trekking around DC with 4 kids!! The rooms are very spacious and service was excellent. Our toilet broke on day 1 and while we were out for dinner the problem was fixed with no inconvenience to us. Staff is extremely friendly the lobby has many internet kiosks for those who need to quickly check email. Drawback: At check in when the pass was given for parking they failed to mention is wasn't part of the hotel fee, a whopping $25 per night. Also a good 10 minute walk to the Metro..ok in nice weather but with little ones and rain it can be a drag. Nevertheless the hotel while a little dated was still clean and met our expecations. Also while we read the pool was small it is actually fine for 3-10 yr olds We would stay again

<Content>We had a great experience at the Embassy Suites We visited this hotel during spring break, a particularly busy time. Despite the crowds, the hotel staff was courteous, helpful, and efficient. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. The breakfasts were wonderful, and the manager's welcome reception each night was much appreciated. This is a great location, too. The only warning I have for others is that if you are not accustomed to driving in a large city, or don't want to, then use alternate directions to/from the hotel from the ones they give out. They direct everyone right through downtown DC, a harrowing journey for those who are not prepared for such an adventure. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great place for a family vacaton or a business trip Great hotel. Very busy during Easter vacation but the staff did a great job, the room was well appointed, large and quiet. The location near Dupont Circle is about 3 blocks from a metro stop that takes you directly to the sites of DC. I would highly recommend the hotel.

<Content>Great for families I love this hotel. It's beautiful without being snobby. The breakfast buffet and the manager's reception help make it a great value! I really didn't care for was how tiny the pool is. I sat poolside and sipped a cocktail while my daughter and niece swam, and I could not believe how many people just sent their kids down to the pool without accompanying them. After a while it became a screaming madhouse of shrieking kids, and we were happy to leave!I also wish the bathrooms were configured so that someone could use the sink and mirror while someone else was otherwise occupied. There is a sink and mirror outside the bathroom, but having one inside with the toilet and shower ties up the whole room. I would stay here again in a heartbeat, though.
