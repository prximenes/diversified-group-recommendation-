<Content>So-So Hotel, Horrible Bathroom Location: 15 minute walk to most destinations.Breakfast: Decent, European continental style. Loved the Italian cheeses and meats.Room: Huge, but very empty. 2 beds, a dresser and a desk. Traditional in design. No TV.Bathroom: Half-size cement tub that only fits a child. The tub has a seat and a hand-held shower head. Sitting on the seat was very uncomfortable. It was freezing to sit on cement in November. But, you can't stand because the shower head doesn't extend that far. One day when we took a shower in the evening, around 9 pm, they ran out of hot water in the middle of my shower. Grrr...

<Content>A pleasant hotel in Florence The Hotel Orto De Medici is situated a short walk ( 5-10minutes) away from Florence's major attractions.The rooms are spacious and nicely furnished and the bathrooms clean and well appointed.I particularly enjoyed the guest sitting room with its comfortable sofas and various reading material plus access to a computer for checking e-mails etc.The breakfastroom and terrace are pleasant, breakfast itself is adequate but not very exciting and would benefit from a few simple additions like fresh tomatoes, fruit an eggs,( usually there was a bowl of apples on the buffet table).The staff were helpful and ready to smile. My husband and I were joined by two friends who arrived very early in the morning and were able to occupy their room straight away which they very much appreciated.Our room faced the street and subsequently tended to be quite noisy with people congregating outside a nearby bar until the early hours of the morning on Friday and Saturday, Thursday and Sunday were not quiet but acceptable. My friends had a room facing the terrace and had no problems with noise at all, which is something to be considered if you are a light sleeper.All in all a very pleasant find.

<Content>Best Little Hotel in Florence My wife and I enjoyed the Hotel Orto de' Medici very, very much. We rated this hotel as the best out of the three we stayed in while in Italy. The hotel staff were very courtesy and we were well taken care of during our stay. Every need was fully met and the breakfast was wonderful. I would highly recommend this hotel for a Florence stay. Great location and very quiet.

<Content>Not as great as other reviews suggested I was in Florence on business and the hotel was booked for me. Staff were friendly enough, and the room big, but the shower kept pointed to the wall and could not be adjusted, the heat had been set at 80 degrees before I arrived, and I left with both mosquito and bedbug bites. Breakfast just okay, although espresso superb. Convenient location and relatively quiet (by Italian standards), but I probably would not stay there again.

<Content>Excellent Staff but odd shower First of all the good points which outweigh the bad points:-鈥?good looking room鈥?comfy beds鈥?great location鈥?fantastic staff鈥?good terrace bar鈥?OK breakfastsNot so good:鈥?The odd half bath/shower set up.鈥?Wireless only available in the residents lounge - not in guests rooms.Overall a very satisfactory hotel but personally sorting out the bad points would make a lot of difference.

<Content>great hotel! Just returned from a fabulous 6 day visit to Florence, with my daughter, our first time in this beautiful city and it was made even better by the first class service and facilities at the Orto de'Medici Hotel. The staff were very helpful and so pleasant, room was comfortable and very clean, lovely continental breakfast with loads of choice.Can recommend Da Mimmo restaurant just over the road from the hotel, we ate there nearly every night, high quality food at a reasonable price and wonderful service by lovely waiters. We have walked our legs off but have seen some wonderful treasures. Hope to return, maybe with my husband next time!

<Content>Gem of a hotel We just stayed at Hotel Orto De Medici and it was fabulous. We were able to walk to everything in Florence, including the train station. The front staff was excellent and very helpful. The three restaurants they suggested were among the best we ate at during out entire 2 week stay in Italy. We will definitely be using Orto De Medici again and would certainly recommend it for everyone.

<Content>Charming hotel For our first trip to Florence we chose Orto de Medici based on the reviews on this website. We weren't disappointed.The hotel is located slightly north of the main tourist attractions of Florence. However it is only a 5-10 minute walk to the Duomo. Piazza San Marco is just around the corner and there are plenty of buses available from here (numbers 7, 10 and 32 go to the station). There are several restaurants close to the hotel and the manager's recommendations are listed at reception. We visited two of these and both were more than adequate.Our room (22) was very large and clean, if basic in its amenities. The bathroom was also large. It was fine but the bath had no shower screen meaning it was difficult to take a shower without soaking the floor. We did ask to be moved to another room and were told this was possible although we ultimately decided not to bother. The room was at the front of the hotel and therefore suffered from some street noise early in the morning. I'm sure if we'd asked we could have been relocated to the back of the hotel which overlooks the terrace and would have been quieter.Upon arrival at the hotel we were offered a complimentary cocktail on the terrace that evening - a nice touch. The terrace was lovely and the bar is open from 6-8pm each night but drinks cost 6 euro each! Instead we bought supplies from the supermarket around the corner opposite the Accademia and drank these on the terrace each evening. Breakfast was a typical continental selection available from 7.30-9.30. Maybe we were unlucky, but on one morning when we went at 9.20 they seemed reluctant to accept us so we left without any breakfast that morning. The common areas of the hotel were grand and stylish. The internet for guests to use was useful although it's a shame there is no wireless connection available.Staff in general were very helpful and friendly. I would recommend this for anybody's first visit to Florence.,

<Content>Stylish hotel close to centre We stayed for 5 days in Sept 2008. The hotel has been fully refurbished in recent years and is stylishly appointed. It is well located, within easy walking distance of the main attractions (do not try to keep a car in Florence). The room was a reasonable size and clean, but sound insulation can be a bit weak (e.g. plumbing), and the half bath was slightly bizarre. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Loved this special place! Chose this hotel through reviews by others, and was extremely pleased by the location, the staff, and the general atmosphere. This was my first time in Italy, and staying at Orto de Medici felt just like home, and was sunny, bright and utterly charming. Close to San Marco square and busses, but on a quiet charming street. Loved it, loved it, loved it!

<Content>The Orto de' Medici Hotel, Florence This medium-priced Hotel offers a very good price to service ratio. The rooms are very clean and being an old but refurbished building, it has high and well appointed rooms.The hotel offers - as a garni hotel - an excellent breakfast (self-service from two tables). Being not on a thoroughfare, it is quiet at night. Its situation in relation to the main attraction, the Piazza del Duomo, is a seven to ten minute's walk. There are plenty of restaurants in the vicinity, especially just opposite is the restaurant Il Cardellino. At the reception English and French is spoken. The service personnel is very friendly and is supervised by the proprietor himself.The Hopp on / Hopp-off Bus can be taken from the Piazza San Marco, approximately 200 meters from the hotel Orto de' Medici, where also other regular bus lines part for the hinterland.

<Content>very nice The best thing about Orto is its reception. Rachel (?), Francesco, and a third gentleman were excellent, kind and helpful, and informed. My room was large and clean, with a modern bathroom, and a huge window that looked out onto the street. I enjoyed leaning out and watching the street life. The street was noisy, but when I shut the window, it was quiet. The only thing I missed was a kettle to make coffee or tea.The common rooms were very nice, with murals on the walls of the dining room, and on the ceilings of the lounge and meeting room. There was a computer for guest use. The breakfast was good, with cereals, fruits, meats, breads, yogurt, and there was a nice outdoor patio also available for dining.I liked the location, a little to the north of the main part of the city center, but near the Accademia, near buses and stores. It was busy enough at night to not feel you were in an isolated street. There are four restaurants on the block.If you buy a phone card, the hotel won't charge you a thing for using its 800 number to call internationally.

<Author>charm_above_luxury
<Content>get the Firenze feeling many people I've met were slightly dissapointed about Firenze, as the city doesn't have the romantic flair you might expect, althougth it has beauty in abundance, way more then any other city. In most cases it's hidden behind a facade. It's a brilliant place, and i can higly recommend it, but if there's anything that does indeed live up to the expectations of a renaissance place, it's this orto de medici. It's a great location for whoever seeks to visit the city's nucleus. I would recommend a taxi from the staion to the hotel (+/- 11 鈧? unless you don't mind towing your luguage through a less appealing neighbourhood for about 15 minutes.The hotel is charming, well maintained, nice atmosphere, and a helpful and friendly staff (though you might see several different faces at the reception in one day...) The rooms are nicely decorated, there's a good and clean bathroom, and the breakfast is far above Italian average (but still below Brittish and German), with a buffet and served in both a breakfast salon and a little terrace. If there's rumour in the hotel, it's not coming from the street outside, but from other high heeled guests, and from from the old style doors, which look very nice, but can by no means be shut quietly.Over all, a highly recommended place for travellers seeking to visit the art treasures of Firenze, and who don't need marble in every room, but prefer a touch of authenticity and warm, refined, style.

<Content>Superb boutique hotel My companion and I booked this hotel for a 4 night stay in February through Expedia. We were pleased to see so many good reviews on Tripadvisor and indeed the hotel lived up to these good reviews.We had each booked a double room for single occupancy and were delighted to see what fabulous rooms they were. Mine had a lovely little balcony surrounded with boxes of herbs and my friend's room had an enormous bathroom. Both rooms had fabulous views over the rooftops. The room decor was of an excellent standard and the beds very comfortable. The bedding was sheets and blankets rather than a duvet so I was concerned that I might be cold in the night, it being February. However I turned up the thermostat on the wall a little and was plenty warm enough. The bathroom was of an excellent standard and in very good working order. My only criticism was that there was a rather strong smell of bleach, and I wasn't sure if this was coming from the water itself or the drains. We both had extremely dry skin when we returned to the UK so I suspect it was something to do with the water in the hotel.There was a minibar in the room and, although I don't normally like paying minibar prices, I did actually indulge in the Tuscan wine and mineral water because, frankly, the price was so much better than at home in London. Breakfast was a pleasant continental affair and the views over the garden were lovely. Choice was reasonable with cereal, fruit, yoghurts, pastries etc... Perfectly acceptable for a 3 star hotel. We didn't make use of the lounges in the hotel but peeked at them and they were very pleasant. The hotel, however, did not have a licensed bar, which was a shame as we would have liked a nightcap when coming in after dinner in the evening.The location was excellent. We arrived by train and made our way to the hotel on foot as we had wheels on our suitcases. It took a little while, however, as the pavements are narrow and the traffic perilous! You should allow 20 mins because of this. You can get a taxi from the station but I would advise jumping of the train quickly to get into the queue as they were in big demand by the time we ambled out of the station. The hotel is very close to all the attractions yet tucked away in a quiet street which was perfect. It is particularly close to The Accademy and San Marco and only 10 minutes maximum from The Duomo  San Lorenzo. The Uffizi and The Ponte Vecchio are only about 20 mins walk.The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and happy to recommend places to eat, although we were happy to find places by wandering anyway. My top tip for dining would be Coquinaros on Via delle Oche (behind the Duomo). The opening hours are great (open all day as well as evening) and the pear and cheese ravioli was magnificient.All in all, an excellent experience. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Loved this Hotel!!!!!!!!!! Hotel was just oustanding. Located about a five minute walk from the Duomo and Accademia in a very queit area somewhat away from the crowds of the city center. Rooms were very large and clean. The air conditioning worked superbly. In fact it was so cold at night, we had to turn it off. The breakfast area and the terrace was just beautiful. Especially the terrace in the evening for a cocktail. If you have a car, the hotel has valet parking and arranges for someone to bring the car to the front door of the hotel upon reuquest for 5E. All in all, we couldn't have been happier here. Lots of great restuarants and cafe nearby.

<Content>Pleasant stay spoiled by careless staff I have had the pleasure of staying several times at this hotel. It is a lovely, attractive and clean place. The location is handy for the station but not too close. One particular incident spoiled the hotel experience. When returning close to midnight, the hotel gate was locked and noone was at the reception desk to let me in. Despite ringing the hotel bell for 15 minutes no one came to open the gate. Eventually, the receptionist appeared from nowhere to answer the phone at reception and saw me standing outside. I was finally let me in but there was no explanation or apology for the inconvenience. The staff next day explained that the locked gate policy was the result of limited numbers of staff and the receptionist had been preparing the breakfast room for the next morning, This was not a sufficient reason, It is not appropriate to lock guests out and have them stand in a dark side street not knowing whether they will be able to enter the building that night or not. There was a locked gate and a receptionist who had disappeared from reception. Keys should be provided to every guest to open the gate, This incident coloured my experience of the hotel.

<Content>One of our Favorites!! We stayed in the Orto de Medici for 4 nights---and it was FABULOUS! Everything about this hotel was perfect--the location, the room, the breakfast....EVERYTHING! WHen we checked in, we were told we were upgraded and that was a nice surprise after a long train ride! The room was incredible....huge with a brand new bathroom and a terrace that had a fantastic view of Florence and the Duomo. It could not have been better. The breakfast room was nice and relaxing, and you could even sit out on the terrace and enjoy! Everything is within walking distance--the train station, the Accademia, Duomo, Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio..it was terrific. I highly recommend this hotel...you will LOVE it!

<Content>CHARMING LITTLE GEM Great Place! We booked through the hotels website and were pleasantly surprised to find the hotel was all it had been made out to be. The Hotel is centrally located close to all the tourist attractions yet in a quiet environment.We stayed one night in the Superior Room and the standard room. The views of Florence and its environs from the Superior room balcony were great. The rooms were very well appointed and were clean and spacious.The charming breakfast terrace was complimented by a wholesome breakfast consisting of a selection of yoghurts, a variety of cold meats and Cheeses, cereals, and fruits.The staff were very courteous and friendly and ever willing to assist us with our queries and requests. They even booked the Accademia and Uffizi tickets for us saving us the hassle of queing up.I would definitely recommend this hotel. we'll be back when next in Firenze.

<Content>A jewel tucked into Florence. This hotel was a shining jewel in our group tour in Italy. Great attention was paid to detail, and our 2-day stay was very pleasant and comfortable. The staff were pleasant and helpful, the breakfast was a variety of healthy and delicious food, and the location is ideal for those who like to walk many of Florence's historical attractions. I will come back to Italy with my family, and when I come to Florence, this is where I will stay!

<Content>Double thumbs up We recently returned from a short stay at the Hotel Orto De Medici, and we'll definitely return for a second portion in the future.The hotel is conveniently located 10 mins from Duomo and the train station. In fact, it was a doddle seeing all the sights on foot from the hotel.The hotel's interior is classically Italian. The room we stayed in was very spacious, and we were nicely cooled from the scorching heat by quiet and efficient aircon. The en-suite shower room was modern and the linen was clean  fresh. The hotel staff couldn't have been more welcoming or attentive. They were genuinely happy to help with all we needed, and had some excellent restaurant recommendations.

<Content>Lovely and very ideally placed hotel We stayed 4 nights at the Orto De Medici in June and found it to be a lovely hotel in the perfect place - far enough from the main tourist area to benefit from the more locals restaurants and bars but near enough to walk to all the sites within minutes, in fact it is an easy walk in one direction right across the city centre to the Ponte Vecchio within 30 minutes! The staff were very helpful and when we mentioned the air-condtioning wasn't working that well (my husband was more bothered than me as it rained 2 days so wasn't over hot) they tried to fix it and left us a bottle of wine on ice in the room (thankyou very much to the hotel as I notice you do read these reviews). The terrace was beautiful for breakfast and an apperitiff in the evening, including a free Prosecco on the first evening! The room was a nice size with very lovely old furniture and we had a view over the front street - although a little noisy from the bar just down the street we spent the next evening in there enjoying cocktails amongst locals so didn't really mind. We would definately recommend this hotel and should we return to Florence would stay here again.

<Content>Great Choice! My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Orto De Medici for three nights as part of our Italian vacation. We loved everything about this hotel. The staff was so helpful in securing reservations, answering our questions and just being overall friendly in every way. Each day we would ask for directions or suggestions and they were always willing to help.The hotel was just far enough from the Duomo to not feel like you were being mobbed by people, but only took about 10 minutes to walk to the Duomo. It is also just around the corner from a main bus stop and taxi stand. Our room was very spacious and a perfect temperature. It was very warm when we were in Florence, so we cooled the room off with the air conditioner. While it does not run while you are out of your room (you must have your key in for electricity) it would cook off in about 10 minutes when back in the room.We enjoyed breakfast each morning and there was plenty for all tastes. Our first night there we also had a drink on the garden terrace which was very relaxing and a nice added treat. Since we were only there 3 days, we only got to enjoy this one evening, but wished we had again.We will most def. stay at this hotel if we return to Florence!

<Content>Wonderful hotel! Had a really fantastic stay at the Hotel Orto de Medici, lovely relaxed and friendly atmosphere with very attractive original Florentine decor, yet complete with very modern bathroom facilities. Reception staff were wonderful, recommended 2 lovely restuarants which really added to the enjoyment of our stay in Florence. I have already decided to bring my mother back to stay next year - highly recommended!

<Content>What a hidden gem! I booked through Thomsons City Breaks with the help of TA. The hotel ticked all our boxes, small authentic and away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre.Check in was effortless. We were given a map and the hotel clearly marked on it, together with directions to the Accademia, Duomo and markets. Our room was on the 4th Floor, but unfortunately had a view of the fire escape - no problem! The whole city is full of views and you can't see them when you sleep!The room was stuffed with original features, a majolica tiled floor, a very old painted wardrobe and an antique desk. The bed dominated the room. This was the most comfortable hotel bed that we have ever slept in (better than some 5 star hotels we have been to!). There was a well stocked mini bar/fridge, a tv and air con in the room (much needed as it reached 92 degrees while we were there!!) The bathroom was huge! A bidet, bath and shower, together with the usual loo. There was a basket full of hotel branded toiletries. An unusual feature for me (although it may be normal for Italy) was rather than have fluffy hand and face towel, they were linen!The staff always smiled and greeted us, no matter what time of day we saw them.The public areas were beautiful, with many more original features, such as painted ceilings and parquet flooring. The breakfast room has very pretty wall paintings of floral scenes and opened out onto a quiet terrace, where you could have breakfast or a quiet drink in the evening.Breakfast was a cold selection of rolls, bread, croissants and cake, with cheese and cold cuts. There was also fresh juices available together with milk, coffee and tea. 3 types of cereal were served, together with a variety of flavoured yoghurts, fruit salad and fresh fruit. There was so much choice!The hotel is said by come on these boards to be 'out of the way' - it is not! It is 2 minutes to the mercato centrale by walking left out of the hotel and continuing along Via San Gallo and heading straight until you get to San Lorenzo. Take a left and wander through the colourful stalls around San Lorenzo on your way to the market. Alternatively, if you head straight on when you get to San Lorenzo you will shortly get to the Duomo. Nothing is too far in Florence! I managed, even with a broken bone in my foot!For a pre-dinner drink try the 'pub' 2 doors along. They serve food and a drink for 7.50 euros from 7.30 til 9.30. They also do great cocktails for 6 euros. I can personally recommend the Mojitos!Any questions - just ask

<Content>Great Location We spent 4 days in Firenze and the location of this hotel is great. Close enough to the Duomo without all the hustle and bustle of the crowds. On our first day we took the open top bus to get a feel for the city and the attractions. We then walked everywhere and after a long day had a refreshing drink on the terrace at the Hotel - so peaceful. We had some lovely meals and the food was in general very good at the local restaurants. The pub next door called The Pub is a hit with all the locals and we managed to stay there till 3am even though it states 1.30am as closing.!! The coffee bar called Jollys opposite hotel is great place for a coffee and danish whilst planning the day's events. Would definitely stay at this hotel again when we return. Friendly staff and very helpful. A lovely city but make sure you are wearing comforatble shoes.!! ENJOY your experience.!!!

<Content>Excellent location Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights during April. The hotel is in an excellent position being in a quiet location but within easy walking of all tourist sights. The staff were courteous and helpful . The breakfast, served in a delightful room adjacent to the flower filled terrace, was good by Italian standards with plenty of choice. My double room for a single person was very clean and had a large modern bathroom. The only drawback was that being an old palazzo converted into a hotel there was considerable noise from the plumbing. Also, I prefer to sleep with my window open but found a slight smell coming up the stairwell so was obliged to sleep with the window closed. The hotel has air conditioning which would be necessary in the summer. One of the rooms overlooking the terrace would have been more desirable but I imagine would have been more expensive. There are some excellent restaurants in the vicinity. Ristorante da Mimmo, almost opposite the hotel, was first class. Though a little more expensive, I would also recommend Taverna del Bronzino which was within 5 min. walking distance.If you are after a reasonably priced, well-situated hotel in Florence, then I would recommend this one. I shall certainly be returning.

<Content>comfortable, clean, excellent service Super service, good position just out of range of the crowds but close to several top sites. Excellent 'trattorias' close by. We paid extra for the balcony, well worth it and so relaxing after the tourist queues.Close by is the Medici Riccardi chapel, a must even on a short visit. The renovated halls in the Pitti Palace have some top master pieces. And for history enjoy a walk around Sta Croce church. Bacchus in the Bargello is more handsome than the well promoted David [and no queues]

<Content>Great choice Have just returned from a 4 night stay at Hotel Orto De Medici. When trying to select a midrange hotel in Florence that met all our criteria I used Trip Advisor and found hotel Orto De Medici - we weren't disappointed. I booked directly with the hotel via their website and we got 4 nights for the price of 3 as one of their special offers. The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant (especially Barbara), the hotel very clean and the location perfect for all our needs. The free internet access in the lounge room was an unexpected bonus and the breakfast of good continental standard. Although very central it is away from the hustle and bustle of the main tourist attractions which I liked. My room was a pleasant surprise and very large however my traveling companion had a very small double room with a window that opened to a view of a brick wall. The only thing missing that I would have liked was tea making facilities in the room. I would definitely choose to stay at Hotel Orto De Medici again should I be lucky enough to revisit Florence in the future.

<Content>Loved Orto de Medici My sister and I stayed three nights at Orto de Medici. The room was large, comfortable, and extremely clean. The location was ideal, just a short walk from Piazza de San Marco bus stops and a bit longer walk to San Lorenzo market and the Duomo. The staff was wonderfully helpful, and the price through Orbitz was great value for money. Next time I visit Florence, I will book Orto de Medici.

<Content>Charming hotel This was our first trip to Florence and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Orto de Medici. The hotel had been recommended by a family member who had stayed there several years ago. The central location allowed us to walk all over Florence. The morning breakfast was very nice and the staff was friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>OK We stayed here for four nights in 3/08 and the hotel special was stay for 4 nights and pay for 3 - which was a nice savings. The staff was very helpful and the location was ideal and it was a direct walk to all the sights, but just enough away from the hustle and bustle. The sitting areas for the computer/relaxing on the first floor were very nice. The breakfast area also opened onto a nice outside area, but the weather unfortunately prevented enjoying it. On the down side the breakfast was more US continental and didn't include any hot dishes (eggs , ham etc.) and almost no pastries. With the high price of food in Italy and the weak dollar to Euro conversion, the large hotel breakfasts have become a mainstay for us, as we eat a huge breakfast and then just snack until dinner or a late lunch. The room was somewhat aging and our bedspread smelled like a perfumed disinfectant or just perfume - and it was somewhat overpowering. We put the spread out on the balcony overnight so we could sleep. There were also some silverfish- or some small crawlies- in the bathroom at night. In all fairness to the hotel -we DID not notify the desk about any of our complaints which we should have.

<Content>Excellent Orto De Medici My party of 12 friends stayed at the Orto De Medici in March 2008.We found the hotel very quiet but still very close to the centre of Florence. It was easy to find from the railway station, about 15 minutes walk with bags.The hotel was very clean and the rooms were comfortable. We found the staff very helpful with our many queries. The breakfast was excellent. The hotel was very close to some of the major tourist attractions and I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Florence .

<Content>Nice Hotel, Very Thin Walls My wife and I recently spent two nights there in March. The hotel had very nice amenities and the rooms were well kept. The morning breakfast was nice, even if it was only continental. The bathrooms were nice and spacious, the only problem being the lack of an enclosed shower area to prevent water from getting all over the floor.The major con we had with this hotel were the extremely thin walls such that we were able to hear our neighbors at all times.The location was nice, but the immediate area around the hotel seemed a little shady.Overall good hotel, although next time in Florence I would try to find a hotel closer to the historic center and/or in a nicer part of town.

<Content>Highly recommended! The Hotel Orto de Medici was perfect for our weekend break in Florence. The hotel itself is very grand and well maintained for a three star hotel. The rooms were spotless and all the staff that we met were very welcoming and helpful. The hotel is in an ideal location for exploring Florence: five minutes from the Galleria del Accademia and about ten minutes from the Duomo and Uffizi Gallery. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again when we return to Florence.

<Content>Clean, central base in Florence Orto De Medici Hotel is simple, clean, and a very central base for exploring Florence. At 100 USD per night in the off-season, the Orto De Medici was a great value for its location - less than a five minute walk to the Duomo. The bedroom was bit stark and the furnishings, while very clean, had certainly seen better days. The bathroom, which was likewise very clean, had a small standing shower which, no matter how carefully we showered, flooded the entire bathroom! We stayed in the cheapest room available, but if I stayed again I think it would be worth paying a bit extra for a view of something other than the enclosed fire escape! The lobby is also small and unremarkable. However, We figured out on the last day that the public rooms (a lounge and breakfast area) are actually on the first floor and are beautiful - views overlooking Florence, Renaissance-style painted ceilings, and comfy furniture.The staff at the front desk was very polite and prompt with handling requests such as finding a safe place to store my laptop. However, they did not seem to be experts on the area (i.e., weren't very familiar with the train/bus stations and when we asked for a restaurant open late, they sent us to a square two blocks away on which everything was completely shut). If you are looking to spend much time at your hotel or for a hotel with extensive guest services, the Orto De Medici Hotel is probably not a great fit. However, if you are a looking for a clean place to sleep and spend most of your time exploring, you probably can't do much better than the Orto de Medici for the central location and reasonable price.

<Content>Definately recommend Very good value for money. Rooms are clean with elegant decor. Bathrooms have been recently renovated. Very nice breakfast room overlooking a terrace  lovely lounge area with international newspapers, books, tv etc. Location is good - away from noise of traffic  piazzas  yet only a short walk to the action. Local buses also in nearby piazza going in each direction. Hotel staff  management very friendly  willing to accommodate needs/requests eg the single room I booked was literally a single bed in a very small room. Staff were more than happy show me other available rooms  relocate me. My suggestion for single travellers is to pay the small price difference to get a double room, especially if you manage to get a room with the magnificent view over the rooftops of Florence!

<Content>Reminds me of my Grandma's House Not exactly amazing. The communal spaces do not match the rooms (i.e. communal looks super modern vs. your room looking like grandma's). Lots of pastels, old and small television, old looking minibar, creaky wooden floors. My husband complained that the lighting for shaving was put in such a way that it made it extremely hard to shave (it blinded you a bit). HOWEVER, the rooms were very well kept and clean. Extrememely central location (be sure to chart it in a map before you go if you are walking, it is very easy to get lost). Staff was extremely helpful and nice. Would have liked better choices for breakfast or a little more variety (also why wasn't the yogurt, milk and juice not kept on ice?). Other than that it was a great stay.

<Content>Charming Medici Recently stayed at the Medici hotel located in a charming old buildingin the centre of Florence. Stayed in a basic double room which was a little on the small side butwe were not in Florence to sit in a hotel room all day. Breakfast was included in the price and conststed of the usual continental fare, Juice, cereal, bread, rolls, meat and cheese etc Location was great with all sights in walking distance from hotel. Hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful and the hotel decor lovely and charming. The property lacked internet facilites but overall we were happy with our stay and consider the Mediic good value for money.We would definately stay again if we return to Florence.To experience a beautiiful view of Florence and the famed rooftops take a trip to the Michaelangelo Piazza, the view is stunning.

<Content>The Orto de Medici is stunning I was in Florence for a conference and an Italian friend of mine pointed me in the direction of the Orto De Medici. A stroke of luck!The hotel is stunning. My room on the fourth floor had a rooftop view of the city and I could see across to the Duomo  to the mountains. The room and bathroom were tastefully decorated and the bed comfortable.The hotel's restaurant and living room are beautiful and feel very homely. It was too cold to have breakfast in the garden which was a shame-looks stunning. The breakfast was generous.The staff could not have been more friendly  helpful  really added to my enjoyement of the city.I whole-heartedly recommend the Hotel Orto De Medici.

<Content>Ideal hotel This hotel is ideally located in the center of Florence, a reasonable walk from the train station (be sure to get good directions before you begin).The room was clean and, for the money, wonderful. This is not the Four Seasons, but as boutique hotels go, it's great. Breakfast was good, varied and healthful. The staff was very helpful.Try to get a top-floor room for a great view of the roofs of Florence.I'd happily stay here again unless I win the lottery.

<Content>Short walk from the Madding crowds of Firenze The website was accurate in its promises. The service to arrange for private pick-up from the train station  to the airport was excellent as was the arranging for museum tickets. Contact to confirm reservations was propmpt. The rooms are simple, but clean and we slept well for five restful nights. The common room is very comfortable, as is the breakfast area. The patio serves dynomite gin tonics for happy hour. The hotel is a pleasant walk from the main downtown sights in a less touristy and more local scene. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Terrible is the only word!! This hotel has a great location in the centre of Florence within walking distance of shops and attractions. Booked through expedia pictures looked good backed up by good reviews however our experience was different!!!Public areas were nice however our room was small and looked like something from the 1920's! and I don't mean in a nice way - in need of a refurb!! Paintwork on walls was chipped furniture old and I can't even describe the bathroom - awful is the only word!!On one day we left the hotel at 1 in the afternoon to return to the room not having been serviced!!!! We asked at reception for towels as the room had not been serviced and thats what we got - they didn't even take the old ones away!! Breakfast was a good selection continental style however room was very small and too many people squashed into it!!I wouldn't recommend this hotel - there are many to choose from in Florence and they must be better than this!!

<Content>Pleasant memories This is a very good hotel. Definately not a palace, but you get good service, one of the best locations!, clean room for a decent price. The thing that I liked about this hotel was the unforgettable breakfast room with beautiful view and live flowers on the table. On arrival, we were offered a drink, that was a lovely touch. The girl who served us drinks was very nice. In general, the hotel offeres qiet , hassle free atmosphere. I don't know why, but the main thing Iliked about it, was gorgeouse pink flowers on each of the breakfast table. A nice begining of the day to see Florence. I woud come back to this hotel, definatey.

<Content>Fine hotel Fine hotel well located to see the Duomo, Uffizi, San Croce. Many good ristorantes, self-service restaurants nearby. (We tried several and our best meal turned out to be an eggplant parmesan at the self-service on Piazza San Marco). Only two blocks to the Accademia. About a 15-minute walk to the stazione. Remodeled into the present hotel in 2000. Beautiful marble floors, lovely old furnishings. Nice large sitting room with magazines, books in Italian, some in English. Good continental breakfast with the usual cheese, meats, fresh fruit, rolls, pastries, cereals, well-served in large, lovely room. This opens on to a first floor patio overlooking a pretty courtyard for warm weather breakfasts. Elevator was new and modern. Very nice large, 2nd floor room with beautiful, large, old wardrobe with safe, overlooked the courtyard. Room tended to be a little on the cool side, maybe due to the marble floor. Nice modern bathroom with bidet; oddly, had a bath tub with modern hand-held showerhead-hose but did not have a shower curtain. Had to be careful to always point the shower along the wall. Worked alright once we learned to do this. The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful with booking reservations, giving information about opening times and directions. Very friendly and nice. We would definitely recommend the Orto De Medici to anyone.

<Content>Customer satisfaction Recently spent 3 nights at this delightful hotel, the service of the staff at reception was efficient and friendly from the initial enquiry to the final taxi booking.The hotel is situated in a quiet back street within easy walking distance of all the wonders of Florence. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and immaculately clean.Breakfast is served in an elegantly decorated room with access to a garden terrace. The food served at breakfast is adequate but not particularly interesting. However this should not detract from the overall value for money that is offered by this excellent hotel. I would especially like to mention Barbara in reception, the perfect front of house ambassador. Thank you.

<Content>Fabulous Florence, fabulous hotel We have recently returned from a fabulous stay in Florence. We chose the Orto de Medici Hotel after reading the reviews on this website and it more than lived up to expectations. We stayed in a large standard room with a shower, the room was beautifully presented  kept spotlessly clean. Everybody at the hotel went out of their way to make our stay memorable, from the ladies in the breakfast room who made us cappachino every morning to the receptionists who put up with my dire attempts to speak italian. Florence itself is all you could imagine it to be  I would be hear all day if I started to try to describe it! We ate at a different restaurant every evening, all recommended by the people at the hotel, all of which were first class. The location of the hotel was extremely central  I don't think we could have chosen anywhere better. We look forward to returning as soon as possible.

<Content>A room with a view What a great place! Just returned from 4 nights here and delighted with the choice. Central location - only a few minutes walk from the Accademia, but tucked away in a side street so as quiet as it can be in Florence (or any major city for that matter!). Ask for room 45, on the 4th floor (don't panic there is a lift), if you want a room with a balcony and a view over the roof tops to the Duomo and Campanile. Continental breakfast was light but adequate, but hotel too small to serve dinner - not a problem with so many good restaurants to choose from! Go and enjoy!

<Content>Loved the Hotel Orto De Medici Just returned from our trip in Italy, and our stay at the Hotel Orto De Medici was fantastic. We requested a private balcony room and It was wonderful to have such a lovey place to relax after walking all day. The location is great. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Great hotel We loved the Orto de Medici. It is on Via San Gallo, the street is narrow and very florentine and if you follow it towards the centre you arrive at the Duomo within about 7mins. As for the hotel itself, it was really clean and pleasant. Our room was on the second floor and was a really good size. It was spotlessly clean and our bathroom was really clean too. Breakfast was nice with cereal, rolls, spreads, cold meat etc. The breakfast room was lovely. It was a bit noisy at night from outside but pulling the shutters over the windows cut the noise down considerably.We wanted a nice, reasonably priced hotel which was clean and within walking distance to all major sights - the Orto de Medici was just what we were looking for and I would highly recommend it to other travellers.

<Content>Hotel de Rubbish!! Dont stay here if you want to get some sleep and like fresh food! What can I say, thought Concorde was taken out of service, however its engine was in the room next door in the form of a hairdryer! Staff were unfriendly and liked answering the noisy telephone situated directly outside our bedroom door. Forget cards for your room key, we had a small anchor which we had to hand to reception every time we left the building. We visited the terrace for our free welcome drink and were greeted by the hotel manager walking past us without word. Whilst looking for the bar we found a shed located at the end of terrace habited by an elderly lady selling clothing and sitting next to two bottles of spirits, we promptly turned around and forgot the welcome drinks. The breakfast was basic (stale bread, warm yoghurt, melting cheese and cold coffee from a flask) not to mention the flies! Needless to stay, I wont be visiting the Hotel Orto De Medici again!

<Content>Lovely stay!!! I thought this hotel was just great!! I booked it at the last minute after reading the reviews on this site. I was traveling alone and needed to feel safe in my surroundings. The hotel was around the corner from San Marco square and near the Accademia. It was about an 8minute walk from the train station ,and easy with my 22inch roller bag. The pictures on the web site are accurate. My single room felt like a double . The bed was very large and the bathroom was modern. The breakfast spread included various sliced meats,cheeses, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal,croissants,bread,juice and coffee. It was laid out beautifully with china and nice silverware.One of the best features of the hotel was its beautiful serene terrace where I rested in the afternoon on a chaise lounge or couch. The first night you receive a coupon for a free drink there during happy hour 6-8PM. There were drinks and coffee available with some little nibbles like olives, cheese and sliced meat. It was a quiet respite from the crowds of Florence. The hotel staff was helpful making reservations and just chatting with me. I even had a nice conversation with the owner when I suggested he start the happy hour earlier at about 3PM.  I am not sure how the hotel moved down from #23 when I booked it to # 28 about 14 days later after my trip but I would definitely stay here again !!

<Content>Good 3 star hotel in Florence Good 3-star hotel in central Florence, very close to the Accademia and to the Duomo. Lots of restaurants nearby. Room is fairly spacious but basic in decor and clean. Bedroom windows are double-paned, so that noise is not a problem. Bathroom could use a little updating but would speculate that it has been updated within last 10 years. Good American style stand-up shower. The breakfast, which is included in the price of the room, is well above average and in a lovely room which also has a very nice terrace. Friendly front desk.

<Content>great location, great hotel great hotel, very clean. Pleasant staff. Breakfasts aren't much to write home about but that's standard for Italy. make sure you visit the Terrace bar for your free drink and enjoy the little snacks with every bought drink.Restaurant de Mimmo over the road has nice food and friendly staff. bench tables means you get to meeet other tourists. casa del vin santo in town made the best pizzas. For something special try the restaurant Bronzini around the corner from the hotel. Old fashioned service and great food.

<Content>Loved it! This is, without a doubt, the best hotel we stayed in during our European trip. We booked it on the basis of the positive reviews and the hotel exceeded our expectations. The location was great, the staff were extremely accommodating, the room was lovely (large and airconditioned, with a huge bathroom), it had a fridge, and we even had a little balcony. We particularly loved the breakfast - in a gorgeous setting and terrific food. We were even given a complimentary voucher for a free cocktail when we arrived. Given the extremely reasonable price, this hotel represents superb value for money. We would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Loved it My wife and I went to the Orto de Medici for the Florence part of our honeymoon and we both loved it.Our first impression of the hotel was a good one: a very friendly receptionist and a quick check-in. We expected a rather small room which seems to be the norm in Italy, but we were pleasantly surprised: the room was pretty big with a big bed. The bath room was modern and clean.Our next surprise was a card on the bed: a free welcome cocktail from the hotel bar. The hotel bar in summer is on the terrace which is a wonderful place to be: it's not too hot and you can choose whether you want to sit in the sun or in the shade. The drinks are rather expensive, but they are served with peanuts, olives, Italian salami and pecorino cheese and honey so in the end it's definitely worth the money.The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the Duomo through streets with very little traffic and from there you're within walking distance from most monuments.All in all, it was a great place to stay.

<Content>Orto De Medici is wonderful We found the hotel quite easily once we'd got the correct road from the station. Incidentally, the station and immediate surroundings weren't nearly as intimidating as we'd been led to believe. With luggage it seemed a bit further than we'd thought but it was ok. The hotel is magnificent, with a stunning reading/tv room on the first floor. Amazing ceiling and decoration. Off the breakfast room there is a huge terrace, perfect for breakfast  very relaxing in the evenings too for a private aperitif watching the birds or reading a book, writing postcards.Our bedroom was very comfortable with solid wooden furniture, big windows  modern shower room. Fridge with wine, beer  water at reasonable prices, mini safe and a sensible 'green' policy for towels.All the staff were very helpful, courteous and informative, ensuring our stay of three nights was enjoyable and relaxing - important after a long day museum and church visiting. There were four restaurants within a couple of minutes walk from the hotel, three very good - we never got in to the fourth, always some reason why there wasn't a table. Probably their loss rather than ours. Further afield of course there were lots more, but we never wanted to venture too far from what became very quickly 'our area'. All hotels in Florence seemed expensive to us but we picked this one on the internet for medium price and location and we were more than satisfied. If we ever return to Florence we'd certainly hope to stay here again.

<Content>Good Value Just back from a 3 day midweek break in Florence.Based our decison to stay here on previous reviews, and would have to say we werent disappointed.The hotel is ideally located on the outskirts of the hustle of the main attractions and comfortably a pleasant 10-15 minute walk from each, as well as a 10 minute walk from the train station.The bedrooms are generous in size with air conditioning, along with excellent showers and bathroom facilities. Breakfast was typically continental but more than sufficient. There are also a couple of restaurants situated on the same street which were less expensive than the more central eateries with the food and wine of good quality!Overall our stay in Florence was an excellent experience with a 3 day break allowing good time to view the city and all it has to offer.As first time visitors to the city working on a budgetwe were more than satisifed with our choice of hotel.

<Content>The perfect choice! We booked the Hotel Orto De Medici because it looked great on TripAdvisor and had brilliant reviews. It did not disappoint!! We found it to be a friendly hotel, which is much preferable to a large corporate chain. The location of the hotel is excellent, right in the centre and only a short walk from the railway station. The room was very grand, large and spacious. The bathroom was fine too and even had an amusing seal of quality on the toilet when we arrived! Breakfast can be eaten in the lovely gardens where a family of local sparrows will gladly share any bread scraps you may have. The breakfast choice was very good, much better than the average in Italy. Overall, a superb place to stay.

<Content>Great Value If you are looking for luxury then this probably isn't the place for you but for a good value, very clean hotel in a relatively central location this is an excellent choice. The rooms were big and clean and there is a very pleasant terrace to sit out on. The breakfast is a bit basic but passable. You can walk to the Academia in probably less than 10 minutes and the Duomo is only a couple of minutes further on. Also, the staff were very helpful and there is a nice lounge area if you want to use it. We got a great rate on a room and I would recommend this hotel as a good base in Florence.

<Content>Nice, simple, clean and convenient. Booked directly with the hotel's website for a very good 110 EUROS a night, which included a decent breakfast. The room I stayed in was very spacious, if a bit spartan. Still, the bathroom was immaculate, included a deep tub and had marble tiling. One thing that was a bit annoying - no shower curtain so you had to be very timid when showering to avoid splashing water onto the floors. It's a European thing, perhaps, but I didnt' care to mop up the floor after every shower. The towels were fluffy and the bidet was a nice touch. Great air conditioner and nice antique furniture in the room. There was a large wooden wardrobe and a small nightstand with drawers - so if you like lots of drawers, be warned.The innkeeper everyone raves about was indeed very nice - I arranged to have the hotel reserve tickets to the Uffizi (10 min walk from hotel) and the Accademia (which is just a couple blocks from the hotel), which was a god send since it really did cut down my wait to get into the museums considerably. It's worth the few Euros the hotel charges.Breakfasts were served out in the patio, which I loved, since you got to enjoy some peaceful nibblings (and ask for a fresh cappucino from the server when you enter the dining room) and watch the birds flutter around the tables in search for crumbs.Overall, for 110 EUROs/nt, I would definitely return to this hotel. The hotel is outside of the bustle of the Duomo but walkable to every sight. There is an internet place about 1-1/2 blocks away. I even found a great restaurant just a couple blocks away...

<Content>Great location Hotel is very close to the Academia and within walking distance of the shopping markets, museums and train station. Breakfast room is ornate, clean and has an adequate selection of breakfast choices. Room was clean, with the standard very firm bed, plus we had a nice courtyard window view. Highly recommend the Academia Restaurant, very good food and atmosphere.Only disappointment was on the morning of our checkout we had asked for a taxi to be there in a few hours for our transfer but when we came down with our luggage, the front desk said all the taxis were on strike. When we asked why he didn't tell us that earlier that morning he just said he was sorry, we ended up having to run with our luggage to the train station, not fun. We were there several days and other staff personnel were very helpful overall.

<Content>Firenze - Orto dei Medici reviewed This hotel exceeded our expectations. It is in a convenient location, but in a fairly quiet part of the centre of the city, quite near the Academia. The new lift took us up to the fourth floor where our confortable room had a good balcony facing the street. The bathroom was squeaky clean and the room had a luxurious feel. We cannot comment on the Piano Bar - we missed it. Reception were most helpful about getting taxis, etc. Immediately nearby there are some cafes and restaurants. The walk into the centre was pleasant and not far. The main markets - fruit, veg, meat and fish - are quite close by and so is the street leathermarket.

<Content>Big, Grumpy Hotel Welcome to a beautiful and very impersonal hotel. We stayed at this hotel with our 2 kids(8 and 10) and my mother (72), after a wonderful visit in Tuscany at Locanda Viani. Here starts the problem, although the hotel is in a great location and is very beautiful, the staff was very rude and not helpful in the least. The people serving breakfast were annoyed at our existence and couldn't wait until we were done eating. The American Coffee was not drinkable and insulting, Americans are fine with European coffee in Europe.I am torn in writing this review, because the Hotel itself is quite lovely and very clean, but for us the whole experience to traveling is being made to feel welcome and at home. This hotel did neither and we would never suggest to anyone or encourage our travel agent to book anyone there either. Happy Travels.

It was part of the succes of our stay. The staff was very friendly, the breakfast very good and served in beautiful surroundings, the location perfect (just far enough from the centre to be nice and quiet and just close enough to be able to go there on foot) and the rooms very clean and spacious.On top of that there are some good quality restaurants nearby

<Content>A Gem In Florence If you want a small, family-run hotel away from the maddening crowds, then this is the place to be.I personally travel at mostly 5 star hotels because of business. The last time I was in Florence, I stayed at the Excelsior.However, this time I was with my extended family (9 people) some of whom balked at paying $600/night for a room. I was a bit nervous staying at a 3 star hotel. The nervousness was unfounded. As soon as we showed up, we were made to feel at home. My parents had a beautiful terraced room overlooking the roofs of Florence. Other family members had very large rooms overlooking the garden with adjoining rooms so everyone was together. The breakfast was as good as any in a beautiful, sunlit room opening onto the terrace outside.Accademia (David statue) was two blocks away and the hotel suggested great restaurants, especially Accademia (on Piazza San Marco) just a block away. The best thing about this hotel, was the fact that it was just far enough away from the crowds that you didn't have the noise and tourist vendors all over the place. On any morning, I would walk out of the hotel and I felt that I lived in Florence, with just the locals out sweeping their walks and getting their morning papers. That was the way to enjoy Florence. You can always walk to the maddening crowds!

<Content>Good Value I stayed here with 2 girlfriends in 1 room. Everything was perfect except for the bathroom.They put us in a room with a very VERY small shower? tub? it was kind of half of each.... no shower curtain, a tiny tub that's shaped so that you can sit on the other half.It was the first time I'd seen anything in that shape so I can't explain it....Basically, we couldn't take a shower without taking twice the time we usually do because we would get the entire place wet.All of us are Japanese, as in, quite tiny, so it was rather possible for us to take showers (and we're used to sitting in tubs), but I cannot imagine anyone larger than 5ft, 100lbs taking a bath in there.So, my basic advice is to ask for a room with a large bathroom.I'm sure they would of changed us into another room if we said so, but it was just for 1 night.Otherwise, the place was perfect. So perfect, I even have a guilt trip writing about the bathroom.Friendly staff, fluent in English, CLEAN rooms, and GREAT breakfast buffet. My girlfriends and I are meat eaters, so we were so happy to see the salami on the table! and the patio is just gorgeous. Constant hot coffee in the pot being changed frequently by a very nice lady with a great smile.Close to city center but quiet. The place is really affordable too - cost performance was great. Just ask for a large bathroom and you should be fine!

<Content>Fantastic hotel, perfect location! My husband and I stayed at this hotel during our visit to Florence, Italy. It was a great experience-the hotel is beautiful with a nice-sized room and a huge bathroom with a large tub. The continental breakfast was great and the terrace was beautiful-especially in the evening when we'd go and have a glass of wine. The staff was very attentive and helpful, with great recommendations for restaurants.The location was perfect-within walking distance to most of the popular attractions we wanted to see.We would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Florence, and it was so reasonably priced as well.

The staff was friendly and the location was great. We could easily walk to all the important sites. This hotel is a great value too. Of all the places we stayed it was the most reasonable and roomy.

<Content>Hotel Orto dei Medici Stayed at this hotel in late April for 4 nights. Hotel was very clean, comfortable and well located. Breakfast was included. We had a balcony room with views of San Marco and the Duomo. Relaxing on the balcony with a glass of wine was the perfect way to cap a long day of sightseeing. When we booked the room, the hotel was offering 4 nights for the price of 3, which was a very good deal. However, we chose to stay here based on the proximity to our daughter's apartment. We couldn't have been more pleased with the hotel and the service. We'd been traveling for over a week, this was our 3rd hotel in Italy and more than met our expectations. The rooms are decorated very nicely and while not giant, roomy enough for us to spread out our stuff and not feel hemmed in. The hotel also has several common areas - a library and a terrace outside of the breakfast room for guests to enjoy at will. The desk was staffed at all times we came and went and the staff was very helpful and responsive. Located about a mile from the train station and about 10 minutes walk from the Duomo, we enjoyed the Central Market, museums, gardens, the Arno, shopping, etc. all just a short walk from the hotel. There were also plenty of restaurants and little shops for refreshments just outside the door. We hope to return to Florence and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Delightful surprise, cleanest room, and a serious bargain This was my first visit to Florence, and I was on a budget. So after looking around online, the Orto de Medici seemed to be a good, safe option and I booked a single room through a special they offered. I was nervous, because it was a huge bargain and often you get what you pay for, but I'm pretty hardy. But there was no need to worry. This place is a gem. I admit the room and the bed were tiny (but I went there to see the city, not stay in a hotel room), and it was the cleanest hotel room I have ever stayed in - I walked around barefoot, which I have never done in a hotel room before in my life. The bathroom was gorgeous and spotless. The hotel staff was very helpful in every way, with museum reservations, lost luggage from the airline, directions, etc. Breakfast was very ample and I actually felt like they wanted the guests to feel welcome (a new experience for me, actually). OK, the fruit salad was canned, but everything else was great. Location was great. Walking distance to everything, including the train station. It rained the whole time I was there, so I learned buses are convenient too. If I'm ever lucky enough to visit Florence again, I'll stay there for sure.

<Content>Great florence hotel, good location My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in May 2007. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. Our room was nice and rather large. The hotel has a cute terrace where you can enjoy drinks and snacks from 6-8pm. Breakfast was also good, same traditional style breakfast we saw all over Italy. The people at the front desk were all helpful. The location is pretty good...its a good 15min or so walk to the Uffizi. But you are only a 5min walk from the Accademia and the Duomo area.

<Content>Great stay at Orto De Medici My wife and I enjoyed the Hotel Orto De Medici in Florence. It has a great location and we walked everywhere. The room was clean, spacious, and had a balcony with a nice view. The continental breakfast was fresh with multiple choices. The hotel also has an outdoor area to enjoy your breakfast, although we did not use it in the March cold. The staff was responsive and courteous. The price was fair for Florence. Overall, we would recommend staying at this hotel. The only problem that we had was trying to find the hotel in our rented car. The streets are narrow and difficult to follow. Once we arrived, the hotel arranged to have the car garaged.

<Content>Great Location, Beautiful Property, Excellent Staff My family and I recently stayed at Hotel Orto De Medici in Florence in April 2007 for 2 nights. Our room was gorgeous, large and very clean. It overlooked the charming courtyard where you could enjoy breakfast in the a.m. or wine in the evening. We walked to all the major attractions. The staff was kind enough to book a last minute wine tour of Tuscany for us that was fabulous. I highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying here again in the future.

<Content>Delightful, well-located hotel The Orto de Medici is located in a fairly quiet side street near Piazza San Marco and only 15mins walk (with a bag) from the central railway station. It is very convenient for the major sights in Florence. There are plenty of restaurants very nearby.I found the hotel clean and comfortable. It is elegantly decorated and the staff were all very helpful and friendly. The dining room and terrace are delightful and breakfast offered a good continental buffet selection. My single room was comfortable and quiet and the air-conditioning would be a boon in the summer.I was travelling on business on this occassion but I hope to return with my wife to visit Florence. We will certainly aim to stay at the Orto de Medici when we visit.

<Content>Gem of a hotel! We stayed at the Hotel Orto de' Medici from April 25-29, 2007 on the recommendation of some friends. They said it was a clean and quiet hotel in a safe area. Throughout our stay, we can certainly agree with our friends. Our room was clean when we checked in and during our stay, the housekeepers kept up the same standards. We also felt very safe walking back to the hotel after 10:00 p.m. at night. The front desk staff was utmost professional and personable. They assisted with restaurant recommendations and internet points by noting them on a map for our use and was able to get us reservations for the Uffizi and Accademia museums a month before our arrival, bypassing the long lines. This hotel is within walking distance to everything one wants to see in Florence. The continental breakfast was also substantial. There were plenty of items to choose from, like a variety of cereal with milk, sliced meats, rolls, crescents, yogurt, fruit, juice and coffee with steamed milk or hot water for tea and the staff made sure nothing ran out throughout the breakfast hours. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again whenever we return to Florence.

<Content>Very nice and Accomodating hotel and staff The location of the Hotel Orto De Medici is ideal. Just blocks away from churches, museums, shops and the Portevecco. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. While Florence can be bustling with tourists, this street is relatively quiet. Resturants are very close by, some right on the street offering very good food, for those evenings that you are too tired to be adventurous. The staff is extremely helpful, accomadating, and courteous. Their English is very good and their suggestions spot on. Wake up calls were perfect as were requests to have our car brought around, and also taxi pick up. Breakfast was included in our Expedia package.... It is listed as a continential breakfast but offers much more. The cappacino was delicious, and the choices assorted. I would have preferred fresh fruit to the canned fruit cocktail served, but there were fresh apples and oranges. Negatives are minimal, such as no wash cloths in the bath, as is common in Europe, and not a negative to this hotel. A few suggestions would be to add tissues and a clock...Plastic cups were not left daily. I'm sure if we requested additional cups they would have been brought up very quickly. I would recomend this hotel to a friend.

<Content>A great time!! Excellent in all areas! The location was great. The staff was great. The room was great. I took my niece to Italy for her graduation present. We stayed three days in Florence and this hotel was everything I hoped it would be. It was close enough to all the attractions to comfortably walk. I will use this hotel when I return to Florence.

<Content>Lovely Hotel A lovely hotel on a quiet street. We found the staff to be very helpful, professional, and friendly. The hotel is very clean. Breakfast is served each morning in a nice room with an outdoor patio and consisted of a large selection of breakfast foods. Our room was well decorated, quiet, and very clean. It is a great location to many restaurants, musuems, and tourist attractions. A great place to stay!

<Content>Loved the Orto De Medici Our experience at this hotel was A+. The location was safe, quiet, and clean. It was close to everything. The Accademia, San Marco Museum were with in 5 minutes of walking. The hotel staff were very accomodating. They were helpful in making recommendations we even asked them to check train schedules and were most accomodating. The beds were very comfortable, the rooms, spacious and had everything we needed including a blow dryer. Our room even had a balcony. The rooms where meticulous, I walked around in white socks that did not get dirty. Breakfast is something to be experienced. We found it to be the best start everyday. Very generous and well appointed breakfast room overlooking a lovely garden patio. It was a little too cool to eat outside but a great view just the same. They have a lovely staff member who quietly saw to it that everything in the breakfast foom stayed stocked, coffee always piping hot, just really great. I know we read every bit of information we could on the hotel, after all from Arizona it's a long trip. We were not dissapointed in any way. Hope this helps. Ciao.

<Content>Our stay at Hotel Orto De Medici March 26th,2007We went to Firenze to visit our daughter, who is studying abroad. In preperation for our trip, we looked at many hotels online, and chose Hotel Orto De Medici for location, price, and customer comments.One never quite knows what to expect upon arrrival, but we could not have been happier with our selection.The staff was always pleasant and accomadating. The rooms are attractive, spacious, and always clean. Same for the bathrooms, always spotless!The morning breakfast was typical european fare, in a beautiful garden room.This hotel is in a great location for local resturants.Not sure when we will return to Firenze, but we would certainly go back to this hotel!

<Content>A Wonderful Nine Days at the Orto My wife and I stayed at the Orto for nine nights at the end of February. The welcoming was friendly, and the reception staff was knowledgeable, courteous, and most helpful. The hotel's location was perfect--a four-minute walk to the Museo San Marco, 12 minutes to the Duomo. And the breakfast--included in the room rate--was more than adequate.As for the room, I can speak only to Room 40. If you can possibly book Room 40, do so! It's large, sunny, and has a huge terrace, some 8 feet deep, running the entire length of the room, from which you can view the dome of San Lorenzo, the upper facade of the Central Market, and the hills across the Arno. Best of all, the room was heavily discounted in late February, making it a bargain of the first order. Only one word of caution: If you have room in your luggage, pack pillows! Ours were extraordinarily hard and cumbersome. The housekeeping service was impeccable. I would stay again at the Orto in a heartbeat!P.S. Take the list of recommended restaurants at the reception desk with a grain of salt. And no matter what ANYONE says, food at the nearby Accademia Restaurant is at best so-so.

<Content>Extremely friendly/helpful staff here! The Orto De Medici was a wonderful hotel, perfectly located in Florence. The continental breakfast was grand and offered world travelers a diverse selection of foods and drinks.The hotel is superbly clean and beautifully decorated. The front desk staff was the best I've ever encountered. They were compassionate with our lost luggage situation and gladly booked us reservations for the Uffizi gallery.Although the walls are a bit thin in the room and it seemed a bit noisy at night...I would stay at this hotel a thousand times over.Thanks for a fabulous stay.

<Content>Overall a very good hotel Stayed at this hotel for a week mid March 2007. We got there early and the staff couldn't be nicer, letting us sit in their sitting room and giving us complimentary capuccino until our room was ready. The room was large by what I'm used to in Italy with updated showers (although the water pressure could have been better). Our room was pleasant and we had a nice view out of the window. The location was convenient, especially for the Acadameia (spelling?), and just a short walk to the tourist areas. It was still a little cool to eat outside but it looked like there was a nice patio area off the breakfast room. I was annoyed at myself for not relaizing they had cafe at this area in the afternoons - I probably would have gone down there for that. (I finally read the information in the room after it was too late to attend.) How a hotel fills your bill depneds on what you are looking for, and I wanted location and convenience. This all worked with a good price as well. So we were well pleased.

<Content>Great Hotel in Florence 19 March 2007We stayed last week for six nights at the Orto De Medici Hotel in Florence. The hotel has real character and has a lovely sun terrace and residents lounge. The bedroom was spacious and very clean. We enjoyed the continental breakfast and all the staff were pleasant and friendly. Location wise it is in a fairly quiet street in Via San Gallo, about five minutes stroll to the Duomo (Cathedral). The Galleria dell' Accademia is two streets away. I will recommend the hotel to all our friends and family.We had a wonderful holiday in Florence. You can walk to everything and we also enjoyed our trips on the train to Sienna and Pisa.Linda and Alan GriffithsEngland

<Content>Would stay again, but.... Booked our three nights on Expedia, so got one night free. Perhaps that was why we got the room we did? It was quite small, overlooking the inner walls, as opposed to seeing the outside world. The room was comfortable, until nighttime. Very hot, even with the air (not air conditioning) on. Opened the doors the first night, not realizing how many mosquitos there were! My poor husband work up with about 30 bites! Otherwise, it was a lovely stay. The breakfast was pleasant, though the tables were very close together. The terrace wasn't open, and it would have been nice if they had made it more accessible (we went out on it anyway). Our room was clean, just very small. The bed was comfortable - what more do you need really? I was disappointed though that I'd accidently left something in the room. I contacted the hotel about it, and have never heard back from them. I thought they could have at least responed to my email, even if they did not find the item. We would stay here again in spite of these things. Perhaps we would be more proactive though in how we booked or dealt with some of these issues.

The rooms were airy and spotlessly clean, very nice big comfy beds and nice clean bathrooms with all amenities. Continental breakfast was ample with plenty of choice and the front desk staff were very helpful. All in all a very nice short break, would definitely recommend Hotel Orto de Medici.

<Content>Best holiday ever We had stayed at this hotel in 1998 when it was known as the Splendor, and so were very interested to see how it had been renovated. We were most relieved to find that it had retained all the charm and character that we remembered. The 4 nights for the price of 3 offer was very good value. Our room was large, with a bath as we had requested, and the staff were all very helpful and efficient. The situation is perfect, close to alll the main tourist sites and yet in a quiet street. We walked to the hotel in 15 minutes from the SMNovella station when we arrived on the bus from Pisa airport. February seemed to be a wonderful time to visit Florence as there were not too many tourists and so we were able to get into the Uffizi without queueing (half price for couples on St Valentine's Day - a nice gesture!), see the Baptistery with only 10 other people, the Medici-Riccardi chapel with 6 others etc. We walked everywhere, even up to San Miniato - wonderful views. It was warm enough to eat outside at lunchtime. Eating at Il Latini was a lively but good experience and the 'Jolly cafe' on the street corner outside the hotel was amazing for an evening cup of coffee and sambuca... it was as entertaining as watching a soap opera with a constant throughput of people all doing at least three things at once, very Italian! We'll be back...

<Content>Wonderful Hotel in the Heart of Florence Loved this hotel! We stayed there in the winter and were able to get a great deal on a wonderful room. We had a lovely double room on the top floor with a view of the Duomo and Fiesole. It was a lovely, spacious room, with a huge bathroom and comfy bed.The breakfast was really nice for a European breakfast. The breakfast room is nice, and there is a little terrace to eat on in the summer. There was a constantly full supply of coffee, bread, croissants, yogurt, fruit, and many other goodies. The front desk service was amazing. They made reservations for the Uffizi museum, and were always willing to lend a helping hand. They are very knowledgabel about their city, and very willing to help out. Make sure to visit the Accademia restaurant in the Piazza San Marco nearby. It was delicious! One of our favorite restaurants in the whole city. It's only a block from the hotel and three from the Duomo.Avoid Cafe Mimmo, or whatever the restaurant across from the hotel is called. It's jsut ok, nothing good, and not cheap enough to be able to shrug off an ok meal.

<Content>Good...... I spent three nights at the hotel in mid December.Pros:# Room was pretty large for what I expected, althogh coul dhave done with a slightly bigger bed.# Staff are very friendly# Good breakfast (although would have liked some hot food)# Vey good bathroom, very surprised by the sizeCons: # Very small reception# Coming fom London, Florence is quite a small place, the hotel is a little walk away from the majority of the touristy places (having said that its only a 10-15 minute walk)# No restaurant. Although that may be a blessing in disguise.It makes you fo out and find nice places to eat.Overall :Would I stay there again - Yes. The cons noted above are pretty minor

<Content>Lovely! This is a lovely hotel and I would definitely stay here again. It is located in downtown Florence. The hotel staff was wonderful and even discounted our 4th night there. The breakfast was wonderful and they have a great outdoor garden area where you can dine. We were there during the world cup final and the hotel staff turned on the HUGE TV in the lounge and got us all complimentary soda. The rooms were really nice and spacious for European standards. Definitely recommend this hotel!

<Content>Very practical The Orto de Medici is a very practical choice in what feels at times like a pretty tiresome and difficult city to be a tourist. It was a scrupulously clean hotel, staff were helpful and pleasant and it does what it advertises well. Located in a relatively quiet side street (relatively for Florence, which could still pass for pandemonium elsewhere), the hotel's lack of restaurant is compensated by being very close to numerous eateries, and indeed the Duomo 'central area' is just some 10 mins easy walking. Our top floor room wasn't cheap but it was worth the elevation, and after seeing a number of other city hotel locations we realised we made the right choice. The hotel is very close to the university, with it's hundreds of student scooters, but Florence isn't really a pedestrian's city anyway. If you are keen to see the Uffizi et al then I would recommend the hotel, but to be frank I'd rather stay in Siena and simply visit Florence for the day.

<Content>nice building,but run like a factory The hotel is in a lovely old building in a slightly grotty area 10 mins from the duomo (not as quiet at night as advertised). We had the very nice top floor room shown on the website with a big balcony and modern bathroom. Unfortunately,the place is run like a factory - you have the sense that you've paid in advance (as required in the internet offer) so nobody cares. Breakfast featured poor coffee,tinned fruit and tables crammed too close together in what would otherwise have been a pleasant room. With the exception of the charming night porter, the manner in reception varied from the po-faced to downright surly. Any request was clearly a distraction from the far more important things they had to do .Don't bother to ask about the offer of free museum tickets for early bookers , or the infusions bar, both advertised on the website. The response from reception is a sullen stare and you are told it's closed/not available.despite the fact that it's such a nice building ,we will look elsewhere for our next visit..

<Content>Great space We stayed in a quad room on the top floor - had a great view. The room had a king bed and two twins for our kids. It was spacious and decently equiped. The hotel provides a welcome drink in the terrace bar. There is continental breakfast daily. Its about a five minute walk to the main tourist zone and 15 minutes to the Ponte Vechio. Major bus routes are a block away. We thought it much better to be in this area than the crowded tourist zone. We spent five nights. One day we took the train to Pisa and another the bus to Fiesole. Both excursions are worthwhile. Try and book gallery reservations before you leave home, you can do it on line. The hotel will do it for you, but they charge 3 Euros per person, on top of the 3 Euro fee charged for the reservation by the museums.

<Content>Very nice and quite peaceful The Hotel Orto de Medici was the quiet oasis in our visit to hot, crowded Florence. We had previously requested a top floor room with terrace and this was waiting for us when it arrived. Gave a lovely view over the rooftops to the mountains. The room was a little small, but very clean and comfortable. The bathroom had strong water pressure and lots of hot water. The air conditioning doesn't get as cold as a middle aged woman would like, but it worked fine to cool the room down by bedtime.I loved the breakfast room and wine terrace - however, be advised that they serve a European breakfast of breads, meats, yogurt and granola. No eggs or American cereals, so you would have to eat out if that's a necessary. I also loved that the hotel is located a good 10 minute walk from most tourist attractions - we needed the quiet after a busy day. But if you are not up to walking, think this one over. The staff was quite friendly - our only caveat was that they recommended a restaurant that had closed for vacation (as most of Florence does in August) - seems like they should have known, and it cost us a long, hot walk. The hotel reminds me a little bit of the Library in NYC. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again. It

<Content>Lovely place We had a wonderful time in Florence and really enjoyed our stay at Orto De Medici Hotel. The room was clean and the shower was fantastic. The location couldn't be better. We walked to everything from the hotel. The breakfast was superb. We sat out on a lovely terrace every morning and selected from fresh fruit, yogurt, breads, cereal, coffee, tea, and juice. The waitress was happy to prepare espresso for us. We also enjoyed a free champagne-orange juice drink upon our arrival. The staff were friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Not worth the money! I booked the Hotel Orto de Medici after reading about it in Karen Brown's travel book. Upon our arrival, the desk clerk was rude and unhelpful. The bed sheets were stained. The paint in the bathroom was peeling. The air conditioning was inadequate. The location of the hotel--in a residential neighborhood-- proved to be dissatisfactory. Since the hotel is a bed and breakfast, the close-up process at night was loud and disruptive. I was unable to sleep. The breakfast served was not 3-star caliber. The price of 260 euros per night was far too expensive. I left after the first night; I was to have stayed there for four nights. The hotel did offer a special deal: Stay four nights, pay for three. Therefore, the nightly rate equated to 190 euros. Upon my checkout, I requested to pay the 190 euro rate, due to my dissatisfaction with the hotel. I was denied that request. While the checkout clerk processed my request and subsequently denied it, the two owners of the hotel were in the lobby area. They were fully aware of my complaints, yet were unwilling to step in and accommodate my reasonable request to pay the 190 euro rate. Had they done so, I would have been appeased. In my thirty years of world-wide travel, I have only changed hotels two times previously~ once in Paris and once in New York City. The hotel is far too overpriced for the quality and the service. I will be sending a review of this hotel to the publishers of Karen Brown's travel books, as well.

<Content>Skip Florence This was our first trip to Italy as a family and while we loved Venice and Rome we would not go back to Florence. If you are into art  museums then fine. But if you are simply a typical American tourist there is no unique character to the city-just narrow streets with alot of traffic. The Medici hotel was a little out of the way but the rooms were very big  clean. An older building with wooden double doors to the rooms. Nothing real special but similar to our average hiotels here-Sheraton, Comfort type in an old palace setting. The breakfast garden was quaint. Barbara was very helpful, others not so. Skip Florence and stay an extra day in Venice!

<Content>Good stay at the Hotel Orto De Medici I booked this hotel primarily because of all the overwhelmingly positive reviews from TripAdvisor members. It is a beautiful hotel - soaring, lofty ceilings in nice muted colors. The rooms are pretty sparsely furnished, but I think that's part of the charm - the decor is simple. Our room was in the back  overlooked the patio - so it was particularly peaceful. The patio had just opened for summer drinks in the evening, so we missed out on it - but it seemed as if they were trying to create a friendly atmosphere for the hotel guests. The rooms were clean - wooden plank floors, normal hotel amenities, great breakfast spread (for Italy). The reception staff were very friendly, and offered to book tickets to the museums if we needed it. Location was good - 5 minute walk to the heart of the city. My only note to people booking is to ask for a higher floor if you get there - we booked a deluxe room assuming that we would get a view of the Duomo, but we ended up only on the 2nd floor. I could have pushed it but, hey, I was in Italy and it was all in all a very nice, romantic room for our first nights in Italy.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel This hotel was wonderful. Beautiful rooms with excellent service, you felt as though you were staying in an Italian villa. It is located slightly outside the city center, so it was about a 10 minute walk to everything and thus is less touristy. The restaurant across the street, Da Mimmo was wonderful. The only problem I had with this hotel was that the air conditioning is not turned on until May 1 and although it was not hot when we were there, the rooms are very stuffy and you need to open your window. The windows have no screens and there are mosquitoes there. They do have an anti-mosquito plug in, but it didn't really help us. I think there should be at least a fan to circulate the air, as we were uncomfortable.

<Content>Gem! We had a great stay at Orto de Medici! Our room was on the smaller side, but more than adequate for two. We also had booked on Expedia and got our 3rd night free so it was a great deal! The continental breakfast was excellent with a wide range of choices in a very cheery atmosphere. The location was a a little out of the way, but within walking distance to all the sights and fairly close to the train station. The area was also not quite as touristy as many places we walked by. If you stay here (or anywhere in Florence) you MUST eat dinner at Ristorante da Mimmo across the street. My boyfriend and I ate there our first night because it was close and we were tired after a long day. It was the best meal we had our entire trip! In fact, we returned for dinner every night we were in Florence. Also, there is a fun Irish pub a couple blocks north of the restaurant and hotel.

<Content>Excellent Choice We had a quadroom (1 king and 2 double beds) on the top floor and were very pleased with size, cleanliness, and atmosphere of the room (also contained a small safe). Our room faced toward the Accademia (only 1 block from the hotel)and we could also see the Duomo. Breakfast was also very nice and staff friendly and helpful.Hotel is a few blocks outside of the city's tourist center, which we enjoyed (quieter and nice neighborhood). While we walked with our roller suitcases to the hotel from the train station, the Florence sidewalks are very narrow which makes this more of a chore than normal 鈥?consider a taxi if you have heavy bags. We walked to all attractions from the hotel and would stay here again!

<Content>Could not have been better! We have just come back from a week in Florence staying at the Orto De Medici - before booking I checked out the reviews on trip advisor and they were spot on - this is a great hotel, quiet location but within walking distance of everything, room was spacious and clean, staff friendly and great buffet breakfast. There is a great restaurant straight down from the hotel, heading towards the Duomo, past the San Lorenzo market square on then on the left hand side - check out the web site [--]. We ate in here 4 times because it was soooo good, the prices are excellent, service friendly and the food is fantastic, had pizza, salads and pasta and they all scored top marks! Highly recommended! We arrived at the railway station by bus from the airport and our first impression of florence was not great because this area is shabby and not very nice to look at - don't be disheartened if this is the first place you end up because just a few streets away is the real Florence!If you fancy getting away from the queues and the busy town, then I would recommend heading for Fiesole on the number 7 orange bus - this is a small village about 8 km outside Florence with a great Roman and Etruscan archaeological site and a lovely hill walk up Monte Cecero if you are feeling energetic - the views are great and you get a good feel for the Tuscan countryside.Enjoy!!!

<Content>Great Hotel Just returned from this hotel, having spent three nights there. As already mentioned in previous reviews, so near station which was excellent for taking daily trips to Siena and San Gimignano as we did, yet so near the main part of Florence with Cathedral and shops and restaurants. We had a lovely meal on one evening just across from the hotel - truly Italian and very friendly staff. We also had a beautiful meal at the Golden View, with windows overlooking the Arno - just across the Ponte Vecchio and turn to left. Hotel itself was perfect - staff so friendly and helpful and breakfasts with plenty selection. Our room was large and faced the front though we didn't find it noisy at all. Huge bathroom also with a hallway between bedroom and bathroom which housed a large wardrobe and coatstand!! We would return here with no hesitation.

<Content>great hotel - recommend to anyone Just got back from 3 nights at the Orto de Medici and it is a lovely hotel. It really has that traditional tuscan feel about with the period furniture and decor all throughtout together with the frescos in the breakfast room, which makes your stay very special indeed. Our room was a good size, but small compared to others in the hotel I believe. It was very clean, not at all shabby, nice decor and had a TV, mini bar and the most fantasic shower we have ever had. The only downsides where we didn't have a view as we faced the inner light well and the bathroom door was a sliding one that didn't shut tightly, so you could hear everything from both sides. But as we had booked through expedia and got 3 nights for the price of 2 I wasn't complaining. The location of it is fantastic and we tried both italian resturants either side of the hotel and would recommend them if your not in the mood for a walk elsewhere.In summary this is a lovely hotel which would have earned 5 out of 5 had we had a bigger room with a view instead if the 4 I will give it - but I will be staying there next time anyway!!

<Content>Wonderful hotel stay We arrived at the hotel (myself, my husband and my daughter) after a very long airplane ride. We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. The room was very comfortable and fairly large. The beds were very comfortable and we had no trouble sleeping at all. Since it was wintertime, the heat in the room was perfect. We had a very nice view from our terrace. The continental breakfast was very good. The location of the hotel was very convenient and we were able to walk to everything. It was about a 5 minute walk to the Duomo and about a 15 minute walk to the Ponte Vecchio. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Nice Hotel We really enjoyed our 2 nights at the Orto De'Medici. Good location and very friendly staff. Our room was HUGE (triple with a queen and 2 singles) with a nice bathroom. Room furniture was somewhat dated but the hotel's in general was very nice. Good continental breakfast (there was a nice terrace where I believe breakfast is served when weather permits) There is a tiny TV set in the bedroom but they had a rec room with a big plasma TV.

<Content>Great base to explore a lovely city. Terrific location, 5 mins brisk walk from the Duomo and all the other attractions of Firenza. Basically a boutique style hotel, very clean, quite simple and unfussy. Beds were probably the most comfortable I've had in any hotel (admittedly that's not saying much!) and the breakfast was simple continental, a few cold meats, some nice fresh (sweet) croissants and bread rolls cereal and decent coffee. Hard to comment on the service as beyond handing our key in on the way out and collecting it when we returned we didn't have much contact!A wee bit of street noise from the front facing (non-superior) rooms but nothing drastic.There a nice (although not terribly 'authenitic Italian') resturant just 4 doors or so down called Semidivino which has delicious Riboletti good house red and is pretty inexpensive which all just made the Orto de medici's location all the more perfect.We would happily stay again (esp with the 3rd night free deal from expedia!)

<Content>Good clean hotel, I doubt you could do better for the price. I very much enjoyed my stay at the hotel Orto de Medici, despite having a room with no view (avoid room no.3 if given the choice, the window faces another wall). the location is very good its near the accademia (david) and the duomo which is beautiful. and we walked with our luggage to the hotel from the train station it took 10 mins. the staff are friendly and the breakfast is good. Florence is very beautiful. I flew to pisa and almost booked my hotel there, dont do this Florence is much nicer and everything is within walking distance. I travelled to florence direct from the airport by train which took an hour.I would have rated this hotel excellent, had I had a room with a view.

<Content>Very Beautiful Stayed only one night in Jan. 2006. We would have loved to stay longer but we hade 2 travelers the 1st night and 3 the last 2 nights of our time in Florence. No booking site could split the people/days and give us the discounts for 3 nights or longer. Too bad. Our room was beautiful, clean  warm, The bathroom was beyond great w/a big bathtub! The neighborhood had everything we needed. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location, very nice room We stayed in three cities in Italy (Venice, Florence, and Rome) and this was definitely the nicest hotel we stayed at the entire time. The room was larger than I had anticipated and was nicely decorated, clean and even had a balcony with an incredible view of the city!Breakfast was pretty typical - some rolls and sliced meats and cheeses, some cereals, yogurt, fruits and juices. The breakfast area was lovely with a nice outdoor area. The best part about the hotel is definitely its location. It is only about two blocks from Piazza San Marco - a major transportation hub. It's also easy walking distance from the Accademia and the Duomo (definite site seeing musts). The Uffizi and other sites are a little farther, you can walk within 15-20 minutes or take the bus from the Piazza. If you are looking for a nice hotel, with a good value and a great location, this one is for you.

Nice old building with beautiful common rooms and a nice garden for breakfast. Room was clean, nice bathroom. Only drawback was the size of the room (single) - very small for the price.

<Content>Good Hotel, Good location The hotel was extremely clean and presentable. Great location as it is only 10 minutes walk to the very centre of town near the Duomo, yet fairly quiet at night (with the window shut!) and safe. High celings mean that the room is nice and cool, even during the day. The staff were great, from the reception to the cleaners who were all polite. I can't imagine you would need to look anywhere else if you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel that is quite central.

<Content>Terrific. Go! We are a family of 4. We shared a large room - recently redecorated and lovely. Same comment for the bathroom. The balcony/terrace where breakfast is held is wonderful. You'll want to relax there a long time. The location is 5 minutes walk to the Duomo. Less than that for the Galleria Accademia (David). Great location BUT not a hectic/loud. You can't beat it. We were there in Aug and the rooms are well air conditioned. I'd rebook there in a minute.

<Content>Large rooms, excellent location I stayed at this small hotel for a single night while attending a conference. It was well located, an easy walk to just about everything including the train station and Duomo. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The rooms were exceptionally large with beautiful hard wood floors. The bathroom alone was nearly the size of my entire room when I stayed at another hotel in Milano.Breakfast was typical for Italy, perhaps a bit better than most. It was served in a delightful, well lit room unlike many other places.The staff were helpful and multilingual. I was amazed that they would remember the room numbers of everyone in the hotel. I would certainly stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great Little Hotel I loved this little Hotel. The People could not have been more helpful. The evening cocktails on the terrace was a nice beginning to our evening dinner. And dinner at the Accadamea arround the corner is great too. The rooms with balconnies are wonderful. The price is great and close to the station and the walk to Accademia (David) and the walk to the others helped us keep our weight in check. We would stay here agian. thankyou for a lovely stay.

<Content>A super find! Front desk personnel were routinely warm, informative, and very helpful. The room (on the 2nd floor for a single person, inner courtyard) was quite small with no view at all, but spotless, simple and pleasingly decorated, with a comfortable, firm bed. The pillow, one if I recall, was smallish and hard. The room was completely quiet; I slept like a baby. At the time I was visiting, Florence was experiencing crazy high temps (high 90s -103!); it was some relief to be able to crank up my A/C to the max (and lower it later, as needed); perfect! I drank a single bottle of water (already chilled) from the refrigerator/mini-bar and was charged a very reasonable fee for it, which was a nice surprise; most hotels charge an arm and a leg for such items. I also found the room's mini refrigerator helpful in keeping other bottled water I was carrying cold for use the next day. The bathroom was nearly larger than my room, and just as spotless. I, too, was surprised to see that there was just a hand-held shower sprayer and no curtain surrounding the tub, but truthfully, being a small person with aching feet, I didn't mind having to sit down and spray myself (and feet) using some caution and control to keep water in the tub. A delicious and abundant breakfast was offered on the upper outside terrace. It was a quiet space with a view of neighboring tiled roofs that offered a relaxing, warm, inspiring place to begin the day. I would stay again, and have already told others of the wonderful find!

<Content>Great hotel in Florence Recently spent 2 nights with my family of 5 at this hotel. The location was great, within walking distance to everything. The rooms were huge, especially for Europe. The breakfast was great, with a really nice outdoor patio. The staff was extremely helpful, booking us reservations at the Accademia and Uffitzi museums a week before we arrived, with the same 3 euro fee per ticket the reservation service charges (be sure to do this...don't wait in line). On our last day we checked out at noon and had a 7:30 PM train reservation. We left our bags at the hotel to be picked up later. After walking around in the near 100 degree heat all day, we returned to the hotel where they let us relax in their airconditioned lounge and provided bottled water (at no charge) and arranged for a large taxi to the train station. The staff seemed genuinely interested in our comfort and experience.

<Content>Great Bang for the Buck! Though we read mixed reviews, we booked this hotel based on personal recommendations from dear friends who like us travel quite a bit. Hotel Orto De Medici was a good decision. Museum style rooms: clean-comfortable-large and quiet. Bathrooms were small but efficient. Draw the curtains for a real dark sleepy room. Close to 'The David'. Less than 5 minute walk to the Duomo.

<Content>Mixed experience Having heard that getting a hotel in Florence after arriving is the best way to do it, we booked this place for one night only 139 Euro, double room on Expedia. Thank goodness. We didn't hear street noise but it didn't matter, the place was louder than a Miami bingo hall due to our room being above the breakfast room. Stay away from room 26 if you go. The reception was helpful in booking museum tickets. We found another hotel Il Guelfo Bianco which was way more bang for the same buck. Not all bad but proceed with caution.

<Content>A great hotel in Florence Italy I had a triple room with a wonderful balcany, it was very clean  the people couldn't do enough for us. I just wish the breakfest lasted a little longer, there were mornings that I wanted to sleep in a little and had to miss the breakfest. Other then that I give the place an A+..

<Content>Great location, nice hotel I had a lovely stay at this hotel. My room was very attractive and the location couldn't be better. It's close to the Accademia and a wonderful foccaceria too! I had no problems.

<Content>Pleasant stay We stayed here in early August 2004. The location was excellent, within walking distance of the Duomo, San Lorenzo Market, Accademia, but away from the hordes of tourists. The staff was pleasant, not as helpful as in other hotels, but not rude either. The room was fine, somewhat spartan but clean and adequate; the dining space was particularly nice as were the lounges on the first floor. Only caution -- upon arrival we received a coupon for a free drink, which we used. When we checked out, our bill included a charge for the drinks. We protested, and the bill was readjusted.

<Content>Great stay in Sept. We stayed one night in Sept. and had a lovely stay. The room was fairly large and we had a nice balcony overlooking the terrace. Fabulous place to enjoy some wine and cheese. Large bathroom and nice access to Accademia and other locations.

<Content>Orto De Medici is a Great Value! My wife and I arrived on May 9th for a five night stay. The hotel is a terrific choice given that it has a three star designation but has the feel of a higher ranked hotel. The location is excellent as it is an easy ten minute walk directly to San Lorenzo market and from there a few minutes to the Duomo and the Piazza della Signoria. The staff are courteous and knowledgeable about the city and will flawlessly advise on dinner reservations (try the Academia in Piazza San Marco for outstanding food and service at reasonable prices). For this price range the rooms are spacious and very clean and comfortable. We were very impressed with this hotel and enjoyed the fact that it is in a quiet part of Florence... we would definitely go back!

<Content>Nice location! The Orto de Medici was an excellent pick for a stay in Florence. It is very close to the train station and only a few blocks walking distance to all the major sites/attractions and restaurants. The staff was very friendly and helpful and there is a Mail Boxes etc right next door if you are interested in shipping home all your purchases like we did!! The rooms were clean but a downfall was the bathroom which was clean but, like I read in another review, only had a handheld spray unit in a tub rather than an actual shower. Another small quirk was that the pillows were really HARD!!! but overall, it was an excellent stay in an excellent location. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Home away from home I have stayed at the Orto twice in the past two years, most recently two weeks ago. I have found the staff to be delightful and very helpful whether it be suggesting a restaurant, tour or simply making reservations. The hotel is always clean and the rooms very European...usually a smaller, tighter bathroom, but plenty of space to relax in, keeping in mind that one travels to such a place to see the sights, not stay in a hotel all day. Breakfast is typical Italian and one can eat more than enough to get through lunch. Location is great, 4 blocks from San Lorenzo and six from the Duomo making you feel like you aren't trapped in a tourist center and living more like a typical Florentine. Also, right across the street is my favorite restaurant (da Mimmo) and next door is a Mail Boxes Etc. where Orto guests get 10% off all shipping which is nice as there is much to buy and sent home. The only way I would not recommend the Orto is if you have a child that needs a stroller and that is not because of the hotel, but because of the walk to tourist areas on cobblestone streets.

<Content>Disappointed in the Orto de Medici The Orto de Medici is very tired and could use a major facelift. We stayed in a quad room (which we found were hard to come by). The room was very large and clean, but was decorated very spartenly. The bathroom was clean, but old and substandard. There was only a soaking tub and no shower--other than a hand held unit which you had to use sitting down! This hotel compared very unfavorably with a 3 star hotel in which my family and I stayed in Venice, which was much nicer.

<Content>Very bad experience The exact same thing happened to me as it did the the Washington, DC person. Upon arriving, I was told that the room had air conditioning problems and they were sending us to another Ni Hotel that was of the same quaility. However, we were there in March and they don't even have air conditioning at this time of the year. I had the same thought.....they gave my room to a higher paying customer. I had also reconfirmed my room. The hotel they sent us to was not of very good quality. I was furious after all the time I spent on the Internet reading reviews and selecting a place I thought I would like to stay. It ruined my trip and we left Florence ahead of schedule. Don't make reservations at this hotel! You may never actually stay there!!!

<Content>A bad experience We just returned from Florence where we had reservations with the Orto de Medici for the nights of March 23 and 24, 2004. Although we had made our reservations through Expedia, I had reconfirmed the reservation directly with the hotel and received an email back stating that the hotel did indeed have our reservations and looked forward to our arrival.After a long drive from Milan in pouring rain and a very hard drive into Florence, we finally arrived at the hotel around 4 p.m. As we began to unload the car in the pouring rain, a hotel staff member came out and basically told us not to bother as they did not have a room for us. There had been a computer mixup. They had arranged a room for us at a hotel a few blocks away. All we were given was a map and a goodbye, in pouring rain, in downtown Florence. I do not believe there was a computer mixup as the hotel had directly confirmed with me. I personally believe that our room was given to a customer who was charged a higher rate than that we had received through Expedia.Be very careful of the validity of reservations and confirmations from this hotel.
