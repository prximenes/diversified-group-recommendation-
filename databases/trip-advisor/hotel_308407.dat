<Content>Beautiful Garden Bungalows We arrived in Bali on the 8th November and stayed at the Santika for 14 days in room 188 - Garden Bungalow. The room is nice and big - perfect for a longer stay with its own couch, lay back chair, desk, 2 settees and a coffee table still with plenty of room to move and store all your Bali bargains... Like most people have said, the gardens are just gorgeous and its fantastic that you can walk straight onto the beach - thanks to the beach works.The food is quite expensive, for what it is - although room service was lovely every time. The egg bar at breakfast was the saving point for me as there isn't really a big variety to keep a person happy as its a bit repetitive. The Sunset Beachfront Restaurant has a fantastic view, but is a bit over priced. Its a great place to sit back, have a Bintang and watch the setting sun.The sun lounges that face the beach are in the perfect position to get some bargains, a massage or manicure from some of the locals. Rosey, who does manicures and Carmen who does massages were both just lovely ladies! We utilised them both many times during our stay. We also found a fabulous driver called Aan Yudianto who has a little beach store in between the Santika and Bali Dynasty Hotel. If you use these fabulous people tell them Mrs Simone and Mr Brian sent you! Overall, my husband and I loved the Santika. The staff were always willing to help and nothing was too much to ask. Although we didnt see the inside of any of the other rooms, so we can only vouch for room 188!!

<Content>What a nice hotel I recenty stayed at Santika Bali with my parent. The hotel is not too large but have a nice landscape. The whole hotel was quite old but they decor it with balinese modern style so not looked outdated. I really enjoy my stay there because their staffs are very helpfull and nice. This hotel facilities was quite good for a four star hotel and have their own private access to beach. The other plus point of Santika Bali is located in the heart of Kuta, Jalan Kartika Plaza, so everything is on it walking distance.

<Content>Understated Some years back I attended a wedding at the Santika Beach Resort and decided that one day I would return and stay there. This hotel is delightful - it occupies an absolute beachfrount location in Tuban and it the thing I liked most about it is that it has a relaxed and understated feel about it - unlike the hotels that sit either side of it which are done in the Balinese more is more style.Much has already been said about the Santika gardens - they are indeed beautiful and well kept. I stayed in a Premier Room - these are housed in a seperate wing from the main complex - its very quiet. The rooms are furnished simply yet are tasteful - I loved the split level design. There are 2 pools - one in the Premier Wing and a main pool that looks to have been done recently. My only negative comment is that breakfast was just ok. I have stayed at several properties in Bali and all offered a way better breakfast selection. But this in the scheme of things is a minor fault.   My onl

<Content>Dissapointing Stay We stayed in this hotel in november after staying at another hotel. We were quite dissapointed when we got there. We got a semi- okay greeting when we first arrived but it took quite some time for them to get us to our room. The room was in dire need of an upgrade, it was tidy but not the standard of a 4-5 star resort. Dining at the sunset restrant was a big mistake we went there for a carvery buffet and all they had was chicken and beef and an area to make your own salad. It was quite pathetic. The Beautiful beach as they describe it had been dug up by about 3 diggers in an attempt to make a sea wall which we were not informed about before we got there.So underneath the sound of the mexican band we could hear diggers and men working. The beach is pretty much impossible to walk down as you get constantly harrassed be hawkers. Overall this hotel did not meet our expectations.

<Content>Buyer Beware We were welcomed at the airport by the Santika hotel staff which we thought was great as we had not booked transport. I should have known better as we were then told that the hotel had been overbooked and we had to stay elsewhere for 1 night. Of course we were angry and disappointed as they then told us the accommodation was in Sanur no where near the Santika. We were given a free dinner voucher each as compensation and believe me this never compensated losing a day of our precious holiday. 5 of us were travelling together 1 being my disabled 12yr old daughter who has cerbral palsy and this just totally confused her. The villa we stayed in was nice but it was horrible outside the hotel and a complete waste of time as there was no shopping or decent restaurants.After this I thought we would be treated like royalty but ths wasn't the case. We had previously asked for ground floor interconnecting rooms ( I had even emailed the hotel the night before we left to ensure ground floor rooms and was told they would do their utmost )so I could be near my daughter but when we finally arrived at Santika the next day this was not the case. 2nd floor with separate rooms. no interconnecting rooms avaiable until 5 days later. What could we do? To make it worse I knew we were not the only ones this happened to. I spoke to other people who had experienced the same. I know it was school holidays but that is not our fault. We paid more money because it was school holidays.3 nights into the holiday the airconditioner in 1 room refused to work and could not be fixed so at 11pm that night 3 of us had to move to another room until the next day.I wanted to let other travellers know of our trouble. The hotel was nice as was the pool and breakfast but we would never stay there again because of the trouble. Given the chance again I would definitely choose elsewhere. Beware of the Christmas school holidays.Tracey

<Content>Nice clean pools but rooms neglected Stayed at Santika Hotel on my fifth trip to Bali. Was really looking forward to staying in this hotel as had friends travelling with us who had never visited Bali before and after reading nothing but postive reviews for this hotel I was sure I'd picked excellent accommodation.We were 'upgraded' to a premire rooms and whilst these rooms were very big, they were in desperate need of a paint job and a darn good clean. The wooden funtiure was nice but had many chips and the white walls were very grubby. The linen and towels were clean but these too had seen better days. I did manage to glimpse inside a bunglow style room and these were very nice and appeared to have been recently decorated and therefore seemed cleaner.The grounds and the pools were immaculate. The two pools were both good sizes and had plenty of deck chairs surrounding them. The staff were very friendly and always cheerful. We did not eat at the breakfast buffet but did eat at The Sunset Bar on night. The food was nice and the prices were the usual 'hotel-style' price.

<Content>Nice, busy hotel, but, staff are not too friendly We stayed for two night at a premier room. The hotel was packed and mixed with people from different backgrounds. The room was big and clean when we arrived. The swimming pools are quite big and nice. The buffet breakfast was very nice with western and eastern food. But, staff are not too friendly there and room cleaning is not good after one night. Maybe they didn't bother much because we were checking out next day(?). The bathroom wasn't cleaned at all apart from new towels. All the soap stain were still there on the basin area. No new shapoo/bath jel/soap. The clean glasses not replaced.Compare to other hotels that I stayed in Bali, I felt the staff were a bit cold in Santika beach hotel.

<Content>Loved everything We had a fantastic stay. We were in the beach front suites. Ten suites, very private with our own pool.The butler service was great, nothing was too much trouble, the staff went out of their way to be helpful.The rooms were great and serviced well each day.They are still doing work on the beach front but it will be finished at end of September. Once it is finished it should be great for swimming.We had no complaints about the buffet breakfast, there was a good variety and my husband asked for bakedbeans and each morning they had a bowl ready for him.The gardens are beautiful and very peaceful after being out and about during the day.It is in a good location and very handy to everything.hopefully we will be back there again next year.I highly recommend the Santika.Happy travels.

<Content>Quiet, Lush Gardens and a great pool! We have just returned from our yearly visit to Bali. We like to stay at different hotels in the Kuta/Tuban area, as we like the shopping in this area. We stayed at Santika mainly because I had read that it had a new pool and newly decorated rooms. The old Santika was small and the hotel has obviously brought the hotel next door and combined the two. We stayed in the newer part of the hotel where the deluxe,garden bungalows and suites are. The older part of the hotel is the run of the house rooms. Upon arrival the usually welcome drink, etc... The room was very big with heaps of room for the shopping bags and space for a table and chairs. The bathroom also was big and clean. The floor needs to be replaced but overall the room was spacious, clean and stylish. Staff came around twice a day to clean and then to replace towels and provide extra water, nice. The breakfast was not the best we had had before but still it was not the worst. Even though the hotel was to capacity it did not feel overcrowded. The newer pool was lovely, very scencic and relaxing. There was beautiful music always playing and the sun loungers were comfy, enough shade for the non europeans and heaps of sun on one side for the europeans who like to cook themselves a bit too much for Aussie standards. The hotel backs onto the beach which is currently under repair but there is not too many hasslers there and the sunsets are lovely. With the new paths along the beach it was so quick to walk to the other side of Kuta and return to the Hotel. We only ate dinner at Hotel once but throughly enjoyed the food, staff, resturant setting and the cool band they had. We had hoped to stay in one of the Garden bungalows as the price was the same or only a bit more but they were all booked as there are only 8-10, so next time we would definetley book one of these as they looked lovely and no steps to your room, Bliss! Being pregnant sometimes the stairs were trying and due to the full house no ground floor rooms were available.So in summary the hotel was quiet, beautiful, clean, value for money, great location, and YES we actually will return here for our next yearly visit.

<Content>Good value for money but in need of refurb My partner and I stayed at the Santika at the end of our stay. We stayed in a premier room on level 2. It was good value for money. We paid approx $80 a night. We didnt really get to use the pool very often, as it was quite windy during our 5 night stay. The pool Bar was pricey and not open very often. I must say I was suprised at how old the hotel was. It looks like it had a slight refurb but it still needs more attention. The breakfast was great, and the staff superb. I prefer a more central location as we ended up getting caught up i the traffic a lot. It was quicker to walk at sometimes during the day / night but it was that bit too far.I dont think I would stay at this hotel again. I think it would be good for a family holiday more than couples. (We are 28yrs old)I would give this hotel a rating of 3 star

<Content>Fantastic Stay Just back from a 12 night stay at the Santika - it was wonderful! The grounds are stunning and a haven from the hustle and bustle outside. The hotel is also brilliantly situated and there are many bars and restaurants nearby. The staff are exceptional and go out of their way to make you feel welcome - nothing is too much trouble for them. Contrary to an earlier review we found the tour desk to be extremely helpful and booked all of our excursions through them at reasonable prices.The breakfast is varied and we never grew tired of the choice available.I had one massage at the hotel and did not really rate it. We found the spa at Febri's across the road to be far better value and its also worth doing a day spa trip in Ubud.We hardly took a taxi anywhere as everything was within walking distance and besides given the amount of traffic we walked quicker than the taxis' were driving!Despite the hotel being 99% full the hotel never felt crowded and there were plenty of sun loungers available round the pool.The only thing that has stopped me giving me a full 5 stars is the noise at night. We stayed in a premier room and some guests thought it acceptable to run screaming and knocking on the doors in the early hours of the morning. Further some guests also thought it acceptable to have their TV loud at all hours (why come to Bali to wacth TV?!!!). We would defintely stay at the Santika again but would pay the extra price for a bungalow. Lastly, we found quite a few of the other guests to be quite rude, especially to the staff and it would have been nice to have more Europeans rather than 80% Australians.All in all a fantastic holiday apart from the noise some nights!

<Content>Great location but....... My partner and I decided on Santika after reading numerous positive reviews of the same. I can only reiterate other reviews by saying that this is truly a magnificent place to stay. We had a garden bungalow room and the service was fantastic. We stayed seven nights from 30 May 2008.But....Be warned...there are major building works on sea walls in progress about 100 metres off the shore line involving heavy duty excavation equipment and massive boulder construction and the work continues around the clock, dependant on tidal movements. We were woken up several times in the early hours of the morning by this work (the bungalow rooms are very close to the beach). Also the Ramada Hotel (?) next door has a new disco and the music 'thump thump' can be felt through the floor into the wee hours too.......we raised both issues with the management of the hotel and were told that the sea wall works were continuing for 13 months!!!

<Content>The Best!!!! Have just returned from a wonderful 10 days on this beautiful island. After researching on Trip Advisor and feedback from work collegues we decided to stay at the Santika even though other larger hotels were beckoning. Wow im so glad we made this decision. We stayed in a garden bungalow, (have some revealing photos of the outdoor shower but thought better about loading onto page as maybe too revealing) Talk about spoilt with our butler service with afternoon tea on our patio. Nothing was too hard ,all our requests were met, not that we are fussy but each afternoon the request for ice (so we could have our gin and tonics) was delivered in record time. (most important dont you think). I cant speak highly enough of the cleanliness of the hotel and all its facilities. The pool was gloreous (used the main pool) Breakfast was great. Other reviews say was boring but if you go outside the norm and try the asian dishes there was something dif every day. All staff are so friendly and approachable. language no problem if you stay patient!! We want to say a big thankyou to all admin staff as we accidently missed our return flight home and they organised new flights at a discount, also we stayed an extra 2 days for minimal charges. cant wait to get back again, next year same time as weather was perfect and not too many crowds for those frantic days of shopping. bargains galore at Centro!! Sunsets beautiful, beach markets no hassles, loved it!!

<Content>Bliss Since viewing this Hotel some 8 years ago my memories had always be impressive. As we were wanting to celebrate a romatic 20 year wedding anniversary this seemed the perfect location. Quiet, mainly childless and yobbo free. It was all of that and more. Our room, the Deluxe Garden Bungalow was superb and extremely spacious. Its outdoor shower was unique...a bit of a surprise at first but then we loved it. The bed was huge with crisp white sheets and plenty of pillows. Towels replenished twice a day by the most delightful room staff. A nicely furnished sitting/lounge area and verandah. We were located close to the beach and beachfront restaurant which was prime. Although there was earth works going on at the beach once the aircon was on and the door closed it was silent. Sitting on our verandah hearing the band playing in the distance from the restaurant was a bonus. The breakfast was excellant. For the first 5 mornings we dined in the main Wayung Restaurant which serves a buffet breakfast, not realising we could use our voucher for a-la-carte at the beachfront restaurant. Once discovered we moved.........I preferred this breakfast personally, but both were very good. I would certainly return to this hotel and highly recommend it to others. Now if I had to give one tip learnt on this recent visit to Bali is.......that the scales at the Jimbyran Bay Restaurants are out................a lot (!) Buyer beware!! A delightful place none the less to spend an evening.

<Content>Perfect Santika Holiday We discovered this great hotel through tripadvisor.com after previous success on the website selecting the Banthai Resort in Phuket and Kumala Pantai in Bali for earlier holidays. We got as good deal through www.itchyfeet.co.nz for this hotel. The Santika is a class semi-boutique place with only about 170 rooms, and you get it without paying the 5 star prices of the more artiificial and larger Nusa Dua resorts. It's a more traditional hotel with heaps of space, clean spacious rooms, great king size bed in our room, incredibly friendly staff, good pools, and perfect location just south of Kuta.The Discovery Shopping Centre (best in Bali) is just 2 minutes walking distance, the excitment of Kuta is 5 minutes away if you want it, there are markets are just outside the Santika, and fine restaurants all closeby.However you could spend your entire vacation by the pool if you wanted too in peaceful surroundings because the Santika complex has large grounds is is set well back from the road - on the beach.ROOMS - We booked a Deluxe Room (their standard room) and was disappointed we didn't get a room with a balcony, but that was my fault, as I didn't request one when I booked. However it didn't overly matter in the end. The upstairs deluxe rooms DON'T have balcony's, but the downstairs deluxe rooms DO. The Delux rooms are right in the centre of the complex, overlooking the main pool. The Premiere Rooms all have balconies in a seperate wing with its own pool - looked really great, but you are some distance from the beachfront.Closer to the beach, the garden Double Queen (upstairs) would be my pick of all rooms, though because we are just a double will probably try the garden bungalows next time. They are awesome. However be aware there is major waterfront reconstruction is going on from Kuta all the way down towards the airport - including just offshore from the Santika.Very noisy if you have a garden bungalows room. It's mentioned on their web page on asiarooms.com If I was booking right now, I'd go for a deluxe or premier room, as you can't hear a thing day or night from there, and they are cheaper rooms anyway.WORST THING ABOUT THE SANTIKA - they don't close the main pool overnight, and on two nights some younger guests returning home from Kuta bars at 2amish threw themselves in the pool to continue their party right thru to 6am. I've suggested to management that they should just close the pools from 1am to 6am - like other hotels do. That would take care of it. FOOD - Breakfast - quite varied and good value.Other Santika restaurants - didn't try them as we like finding 'cheap eats' outside our hotel at night. Our satays by the pool were average only, but food at any hotel isn't usually a major strength.BEST BALI EATS - Febri's Restaurant (just across the road from the Santika) great simple food with ethnic and Euro selections. we ended up eating there a lot, and noticed many other Santika guests did too. Great value.Believe it or not, the best indo food we had was at the Stadium Cafe/Bar in Kuta. The bami goreng is huge.BEST THINGS TO DO -1. Get a Driver (we used Toya who's based at the Santika Hotel - paid him about A$45 for 6 hours) and take a day trip to Ubud (we did Monkey Forest, Ubud Markets, Sanur on way back) and get driver to take you to Rapuan Cili Restaurant which is locally owned and set in the middle of ricefields. Simply amazing venue - and food is good. Could've stayed there all day - they have a good swimming pool as well. Got some great photos.Address Jl. Raya Mas - Ubud follow sign about 800m from baby statue2. Do the Sunset Dinner thing at Jimbaran Bay. We went to JBS Restaurant - food was good - they paid for a driver to take us there and return. Suspect the food's very similar at all these beach places at the bay, but it was a great experience having a table in the sand on the beach. www.jimbaranseafood.com Great staff and service.3. The scenic cycling tour run by Bali Adventure Tours is well run, and gives you a great taste of the real Bali. It's cycling all downhill. One of the best things you could do . A great day.4. Save time - the Discovery Shopping Centre just down the road from the Santika Hotel is the best place to shop - found the markets aren't as good as Phuket. Can't wait to return to the Santika, and thanks to all for recommending it on this site. Otherwise we wouldn't have found it.

<Content>Santika Beach hotel our second home Santika has been our choice of holiday hotel for the past ten years and we have enjoyed every stay. The management and staff are just wonderful and go out of their way to ensure that their guests enjoy a very relaxing holiday. Nothing is overlooked as far as service goes and the hotel food is of a very high standard.After the long flight from New Zealand it is a wonderful feeling entering the lush tropical garden of the hotel and knowing it is going to be our home for the next four weeks.John  Dolores Auckland New zealand.

<Content>Value for Money Stay I have to add my voice to the chorus of praise for this unpretentious yet totally charming Bali-nese style hotel in the midst of throbbing Kuta. Had come here last weekend for a regional NGO retreat, expecting to be presented with a business-like conference-type hotel. Far from it! This was a haven in the midst of busy Tuban, and once inside its sprawling grounds you'd be hard pressed to think you were actually in a town setting. It had far more charm than the Intercon that I moved to subsequently for my own personal retreat. The staff were helpful and were fast to respond to calls for help from the room (adaptor, TV control, etc). The main grouse was that the aircon in the rooms (the standard range)was not cold, and when told the next day, they kept the aircon on through the day to improve matters! I'm sure this is something they can correct.Also, they do not have a spa to speak of, providing only a massage service. Apart from that, it is truly a value for money hotel for its proximity to shops, sunset view (not as good as Jimbaran), delightful staff and garden retreat setting. The villa section especially has a lovely pool setting and walk path. Overall, Santika Beach Hotel as a homely, warm feel about it which makes one feel extremely comfortable and relaxed, and wanting to return. Its short 15 minute ride to the airport is another plus, allowing you to max your stay in the place.

<Content>Don't Waste Time Looking Santika Is The Only Place To STay WE HAVE STAYED AT THE santika beach hotel for around 10 times we always say in a premiere room the staff are wonderful they have become part of our family...we have tried other hotels in bali but the santika draws us back like a magnet. The pools are magic the cleanliness is superior and the location is the best you can get...we are arriving again on the 8th of march 2008 are counting the days as we cannot wait to get there again...the full breakfast is to die for anf the sunsets at the restaurant with a nice cold bintang is just the best. Would like to try a bungalow next time as I went a viewed one and think they are terrific. Security is excellent..have never had to complain about anything at the Santiks and trust me we are fussy...cant say enougth about this wonderful hotel....reccommend going on the Bali Hai Sunset cruise ...fantastic night out beautiful buffet dinner and great entertainment...enjoy.

<Content>Traditional Bali @ it's best !! Santika is one of the few Hotels left in Bali that still envelopes the traditional Balinese theme. Picturesque gardens, truly interested and helpful, friendly staff. Most staff you meet @ Santika have been there many years. Two i'm aware of have been there since the Hotel opened in the late 1970's.The room servicing is exemplary (no shortcuts in cleanliness) and in 2007 installed a new (larger than before) pool in the Bungalow area.Breakfast buffets are unbelievable - Everything for every taste and nationality.I Love Santika Beach Hotel, that's why 2008 will be my 9th Stay. I can't wait to get back to see my friends (Staff).Jan

<Content>loved this hotel! Just got back yesterday from a 12 night trip at the Santika. My first time staying at this hotel and in this location of Bali. Had a friend recommend this hotel to me and I also had done my trip advisor research. I loved every moment of this hotel. It is an older hotel but it has had certain aspects of it refurbished. It is only about a 3.5 star, but it is really relaxed and fantastic. The room we stayed in was a Premiere pool room and was in the oldest part of the hotel. It was very spacious and had a large balcony overlooking the pool and poolbar. In past holidays usually stay in 5 star hotels but this was a cheap and cheerful gettaway, and I do not think I will stay anywhere else in Bali.Tha gardens are lush and it is situated on the beach and it is a nice beach. The locals dont hassel you too much. The hotel is long and if you want a room closer to the beach you will need to get a suite or bungalow. But any room is just a short stroll to the ocean. Sunsets resturant overlooks the ocean and serves really good food and I found the prices really reasonable. It would be the perfect spot for a romantic dinner or even small wedding gathering.The staff really friendly, always smiling and really made an effort to make everything perfect.The spa, really only does massage, but organises scrubs ect. through another spa, but I went to other spa's in Bali and believe the spa staff at Santika did the best massage and really reasnonable prices (remember we are used to paying for 5 star resort prices). What I liked about the spa it is was open air and in a large thatched hut and you could shut your eyes and relax to the natural sounds of the ocean and birds. It was great listening to nature and feel a slight breeze on you as your tension was being taken away.Breakfast was ok. But to be honast no matter where I have stayed Breakfast in Bali is not really great. The buffet was the same for 12 days with no change and I heard others commenting on this also. It was boring and we only went to breakfast 5 times as we chose to sleep in and grab lunch elsewhere instead.The poolbar had great food and I also found this to be reasonable prices. The staff at the poolbar were fantastic. You could also swim in the pool as late as you liked provided you dont disturb other guests, this I really liked as sometimes you need to get cool before you go to bed after a long day/ night of shopping.The Santika is really not designed for kids, but there was some there, but it does not have kids clubs and activities. The location was great for you to be able to walk to places. 5 min walk to the Discovey shopping mall. 7 mins to kuta square. It had fantastic resturants across from hotel. Thai was great, Italian was the best. For the best mexican in Bali go to CHI CHI's next to the bali sling shot.If you want relaxed for your next holiday but still want to be able to walk to things and feel safe I would really recomend this hotel. As I said before I will not be staying anywhere else! I loved it.

<Content>Do Not Stay Anywhere Else - Santika 10/10 We arrived in Bali after midnight and were exahusted after getting to our hotel. When we arrived the staff said welcome home which was very nice but I brushed it off, I was wrong to do this as Santika made me feel at home. It pains me to write this review as I wish I was back at Hotel Santika. The gardens are so wonderful and the room was very well appointed and very well looked after. We stayed in a presidential suite for 14 nights and the room was very big and beautiful. There was a separate living area and a wonderful big King size bed. The TV was fantastic with so many channels to choose from. The staff were fantastic and always willing to help. There is a little courtyard out the front of the room where many a Bintang was enjoyed. The pool was only 10 m from our room but we were never bothered by any noise from the pool ( and it was the middle of the July School Holidays). You can also pick up a foot massage poolside for less than $5AUD which is amazing.The breakfast is beautiful with indonesian food and western food combined - you have so much to choose from its unbelievable. The location is fantastic as it鈥檚 a quick 5 min walk to the Centro shopping Centre and across the road from a fantastic italian restaurant where you can get Gourmet Pizzas for $3AUD. On the beach side of the hotel there is a beautiful big restaurant where you can watch the planes come into the airport down the beach or watch the magnifecent sunset. When we come back to Bali to get married in 2008, there is no where else I would stay in Bali. Santika is like a home away from home.

<Content>best hotel in tuban Having been to the Santika Hotel many times, once again we were very impressed with all the service and the hotel itself. No other hotel in tuban has the beautiful garden and open space that Santika has. Superbly clean also. Its a hotel that can be full of guests yet you can feel like its your own private holiday. And where else can you sit and watch the sunset either from your beach chair or the beautiful sunset restaurant. Its a unique hotel and luckily they havent tried to change to be like all the others.We actually went into a couple of other hotels (melasti beach bungalows and Mandira beach hotel ) mandira was in legian.The melasti was the most dirty and disgusting hotel and it was cramped and just felt closed in , i wouldnt let my dog let alone my kids stay there. The Mandira was small cramped and the rooms were tiny , the pool was dangerously perched above alot of steps. Then you come back to Santika to the beautiful gardens, clean hotel, huge rooms and great service....why go anywhere elseWe have already made arrangements to go back next year...

<Content>Great Hotel, best in Tuban This was our fourth time at Santika and it is getting better! Lots of friendly staff once again and service is the best! Rooms are always clean and fresh linen and towles are always on hand. Rooms are a great size; take your compass so that you can find your partner in the huge beds! Thanks once again Santika.

<Content>Great Hotel, friendly staff Our agent was instructed not to sell any more rooms at the Santka Beach Resort because of renovation woerk to the sea wall. We were offered alternatives but chose to stick with the Santika.So pleased that we did. The staff are friendly, the location excellent for walking into Kuta and the rooms very good for the price - not opulent luxury but comfortable, large and with a great balcony. The hotel has two pools, one is a recently refurbished infinity pool, both have a kiddies pool.Hotel fronts onto the beach where they are renewing the wall - right the way along and not just at the Santika. Once within the grounds of the hotel you are not aware of the work. Many of us chose loungers near the sea and kept an eye on the sea wall work which was quite interesting.The sunset restaurant is a perfect location rather than a culinary experience. The Kunyot restaurant was memorable on our first visit but gave terrible service on the second - we walked out in trh end and complained to the management.A ten - twenty minute walk from the hotel gives access all he shops and restaurants in Kuta - we ate at Made's Warung twice, Ket u pat in Legian twice, TJ's in Poppies One, Kunyit twice, sunset once and at the nearby Batan Waru which is really good.Hotel breakfast is good but too expensive (110,000 HP) if not included with your room/ Nearby places offer breakfast from 25,000RP (less than 拢2).Rented a car for four days with insurance cover for 拢40 total. Driving is manic but fun. It gets you out into the country and back 150 years.Would not hesitate to book again at the Santika Beach.

<Content>Great place to stay in Bali Stayed 2 nights at Santika Beach Hotel (4 Stars hotel). Clean room, great service, great breakfast, friendly  helpful staff, and within walking distance to major shopping mall  local restaurants. This area is better than Nusa Dua and Kuta. Hotel has a nice big pool but there is no area on the beach that you can swim - rocky shore.Suggestion, pay extra and get the water front cottage. Do remember all hotels in Bali automatically add service charge on your bill. WB

<Content>Higly recommend We had a 7 night stay at the Santika Beach and loved it. We were lucky enough to stay in the Raja Suite, so we had two bedrooms(travelled with my parents and two children), our own private pool and butler service. Higly recommend the Raja suite. It had direct access to the beach. The rooms were lovely and large, clean and comfortable. We mainly had breakfast in our suite, but had breakfast once in the buffet and it was great. This resort was in a perfect location, easy to walk everywhere, including Kuta square. The staff were very friendly, as was our butler. I would definatley stay here again.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel This is a lovely hotel, beautifully designed, the photos on the website really dont do it justice. We stayed in deluxe room facing the pool, very spacious, contempory in design but definately with a balineese accent. The staff simply could not do enough for you and you never had to go searching for their attention. Their sunset restaurant was wonderful, great food and as the name suggest great views of the bali sunsets.We found the hotel to be very peaceful (almost too quiet), which was quite surreal as a 5 minute walk took you in to the madness of Kuta. This is my third visit to bali having stayed in Sanur and Nusa dua and this is the first time I have really experienced any hassle from street vendors, not really a surprise as Kuta is very quiet right now after the bombs, anyway if you just smile and say no they leave you alone.The hotel were very helpful in arranging trips etc , on several occasions we hired a driver and car for the day (approx 拢25-拢30), and it really was a treat, as we saw some places we may never have done otherwise.
