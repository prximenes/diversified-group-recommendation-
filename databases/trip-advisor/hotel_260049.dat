<Content>Basic but clean I went with my wife to this hotel in early january 2009. We only stayed for one night and used the place just simply for somewhere to get our heads down for a few hours. It's location is smack bang in the middle of the red light area with sex clubs and window prostitutes literally on the doorstep.great for those who go simply to indulge in the carnal pleasures of amsterdam!  The hotel is basic with a capital B but it is clean if shabilly decorated. The shower was good and the room was spacious enough. Didn't try the buffet continental breakfast but can't imagine it would be much because there isn't a dining room. This hotel would be ok for the lads on a short stag do but thats about it!! Amsterdam itself and this area in particular is full of shady, seedy and sad characters and the dutch people come across as being unfriendly rip off merchants particularly in the pubs and clubs. I personally would never go back here and I can see why so many who do live here need to be out of there heads on drugs. I saw many a sad sight in the bars and coffee houses where young men and women were totally out of it all day long. Many establishments adopt a no smoking policy even the coffee shops but some of these will allow you to smoke if you are smoking just marijuana although the odd one will allow you to smoke a normal cigarette! Totally ridiculous! There are much better places to go than amsterdam in europe and I for one think the attitude of the people currently involved in catering for the tourists in Amsterdam will eventually be responsible for its demise as a tourist destination!

<Content>the + and - of the hostel We're just back from 4 nights in this hostel, and the experience was overall very positive: great location on the heart of the redlight district (between sex shops, marijuana museum, and video shops) althought being two girls alone we always felt safe. We also appreciated the breakfast, the thematization of the rooms, the lockers in the room (with a 10euros deposit... don't loose the paper!), the computer available in reception with free internet connection, and the cleaness (they change towels everyday, and seem to vacuum the room everyday.. not moping). We had an ensuite (room with bathroom inside) and therefore the private bathroom was clean (i have no idea how are the shared bathrooms). Our room was mixed, and we shared it only with guys, but it didn't make a problem to us. The only bad point i have to comment, is that the morning before our checkin they charge 48euros on my credit card: i had no notification of this when i booked, and no proof (receipt) of it. Staff just told me not to worry, that they didn't charged the money (althought in my credit card account it appears as a charge) that it's just a deposit, and i will have it back in 10 working days... so I checkout before having it back, we'll see. The staff was just ok, but couldnt give me more explanations than that on this matter. Overall the experience was very good, i would recommend it, and go back there.

<Content>ABSOLUTE GREAT place to stay for a small price to pay!! If one's done enough research will know that Heart Of Amsterdam is really a hostel. As a frequent traveler who travels easily 30+ times/year. This is my very first time setting foot in a hostel... ALONE (I am a female). Not expecting much, the place is very neat and tidy, and newly renovated, quite decent for first impression. (For people who did not feel the same, perhaps u went there when it wasn't renovated yet?) Staff were neutral, but always polite and helpful. Walking into the room, VERY clean  neat, a bit dim due to the design, but everything's in place where they should be (after all it IS just a hostel!) The set up of the dorm room was spacious yet cozy, with a couch and flat screen TV. Shower maybe be a bit clogged, but that's not the end of the world. Breakfast is alright, but rooms are cleaned and made EVERYDAY!! For someone who's used to staying at nice hotels, this was really something unexpected. It IS located in the Red Light District, very convenient, and very safe. Fitted for a slightly more mature group, I'd say in the 20s, who'd like to take in the culture, enjoy the life of Amsterdam, just chill, without the crazy kids/teens running around. There's also free internet that you can use anytime. I do HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place for anyone who's looking to stay at a hostel. I regret having to move to another more famous one around the block after just staying 2nights. I would DEFINITELY go back if i visit Amsterdam again!!

<Content>hell on earth I really dont think there is a word to descide how much of a [----]this place is. Everything about the place is a joke: broken windows, dirty smelly rooms, [----] filled toilets and shower area shared between 12 or more people. by all means go for it if you want to stay there but you'll be lucky to come out alive it is that bad believe me!

<Content>Heart of the red light district more like it..... We wanted to saty somewhere central in Amsterdam, and this hotel seemed to fit the bill. It is located centrally on a canal, but when we got there we discovered it was also in the heart of the red light district. It is an old traditional building that has been renovated. his means it has the old steep stairs, which you expect in Amsterdam. You don't expect the entire decor to be in black. Our double room ended up being a triple, which consisted of 3 single beds all with extremely ugly (you guessed it, black) safe type units next tot he bed. Basically it was a dormitory room. Fine for stag weekends, but not for couples. This hotel, similarly to most in Amsterdam does not reflect good value for money. On the plus side, it was very clean and the staff were helpful. They just need to redecorate and make it clear how close they are to the red light district.

<Content>What a dump! Heart of Ams is definitely not for the family or elderly couple or anyone really. It is located in the red light district. Be careful of the drug dealers right on your door step, as well as the crowds of people constantly walking past the hotel which keep you up all night with their swearing and fighting. May be the type of hotel a group of young single guys would appreciate as they wouldnt be in it much anyway.. Everyone else- stay well away!!

<Content>Totally Gross and a rip off This is by far the worst place I have stayed in my entire life, I had to sleep with the lights on and above the covers, Bedbugs and all! I have seen cleaner places in Afghanistan! They charged my card 1 month after I stayed there, and I still am battling with my credit card company to fix it. I have stayed in some bad places but this by far is the worst place yet and should be condemned.

<Content>Tried to Rip Me Off My friend and I read the reviews online before we went to the hostel, but it was the only place open so we had to go there. We made sure to book a hostel with a bathroom in the room. When we arrived, they tried to rip us off and give us one of the cheap rooms in the basement. Do not ever stay in one of those rooms. We refused to stay there also, so they told us we had to stay in a 12 person room, but we had reserved a 6. Finally, they told us we could go into the 6 person room the next night. Be careful if you decide to stay here. Also, there is only one key in the room for every person who is staying there, which is rediculous. If someone accidently takes the key, you might not be able to get in. And, these photos do not look like the actual hostel.

<Content>Worst "Hotel" EVER!! The photos are misleading. DO NOT STAY HERE. Our 3-person hotel room (which was more like a REALLY BAD hostel) was three twin beds with dirty, holey sheets stuffed into a 1or 2 bed room. The safe was broken, there was no privacy for the shower, the windows didn't even operate and there was all kinds of stuff on the walls. The free continental breakfast was absolutely horrible. And located on the edge means noisy drunk people screaming at all hours of the night. As far as location goes, I recommend booking somehting a little more south of this location so you are closer to everything else BUT the red light district.

<Content>An expirience Although its quite a shabby hostel, not the cleanest anyway, its location gives an amazing insight to Amsterdam. Located right on the canal of the central red light district it will certainly open your eyes. Myself and two friends stayed here for a week and although we were nervous of the surroundings at first it was perfectly comfortable and safe by a couple of hours. A reccommendation would definitely be to relax on the steps to the right of the hostel and watch the sights and characters go by.

<Content>Not bad We arrived at the hotel and had a bit of a shock when we discovered it was acutally a hostel!We had booked a quad room, the room itself was small - a bunk-bed and two singles squashed in. We also were suprised to find we were sharing a bathroom with the next door room. Location was very good - smack bang in the red light district.Would stay there again, but only with my mates.

<Content>Beware of being ripped off I stayed at this hostel in April 2006 and was overcharged 59 Euros for a deposit which was never returned to me. I contacted the Hotel numerous time and was always told the money would be refunded in a few weeks but I never received my money. Beware of being ripped of my this hotel.This was booked through hostelworld.com using iplanetexchange.com. I was also not given a chance to post a review on hostelworld.com

<Content>æ‹¢35 per night to share a toilet with 14 other people! We booked this new yesrs holiday on hostelworld.com, who dont seem to be put our review on their site!! We would not ever chose to stay in this hostel again. The facilities were dirty, unclean and completely unappealing. The single unisex toilet was cleaned once a day, which considering it was being used by so many people was beyond a joke - most of the time it was covered in urine, vomit and facaes. The rooms were not clean to start with and certainly weren't during the 5 day stay. We were told that it was too late to get breakfast at 10.10 - 20 minutes before it was due to close. There were inadequate showers, although they were clean, they were dated and two of them faced a door which was usually wide open! I have stayed in hostels all over the world, and this was by far the worst for value for money - there was nothing that justified the price of æ‹¢35 per night. The basement room that we were placed is in dire need of redecorating, the outside doors leak water, paint is peeling everywhere, there are disgusting marks on the wall, the floor needs a wash ... I could go on. If perhaps our group had been placed in a different room, our experience may have been improved, but as it was, the only good thing about 'Heart of Amsterdam' was the location, which couldn't have been better. There is a lot of potential, it is a huge shame that the owners have not realised it.

Then Cancel it and sleep in the bins outside they are cleaner, and i swear im not joking. If your Money is Non Refundable, take a loss i swear you will thank me in the end. Two of us managed to book into another hotel, we were not so lucky due to England playing there everything was booked up! We had to go and buy bugbombs, sleeping bags and matress protecters!We came home one night to find the door wide open, all our stuff rifled through and the duty free missing.Avoid at all costs

<Content>Cheap but not worth the Bedbugs It's cheap. It's definitely in the Heart of Amsterdam. However, the bedbugs will feast on you at night and you will wake up to your own blood in your bed from squished bedbugs. Not to mention the irritating itching and scratching for days afterwards. We went in a huge group. Four of us got bitten by bedbugs and we all had to spend money afterwards seeing the doctors and getting medicines for the bites when we got back to the U.S. ( cheap hotel + doctor visits = expensive in the end). So I wouldn't stay here. It really isn't worth the discomfort. (Imagine being on a sightseeing tour but not really paying attention because you keep scratching and/or looking for a pharmacy) Keep your bags away from the beds as you don't want to take the bugs home with you. By the way, the breakfast is a joke. It's just random stuff that can hardly be called a meal.

<Content>Not recommended! Amsterdam was great, but this hostel/hotel was absolutely horrible. My sister and I had booked it online and when we arrived we found that the rooms looked nothing like the photos. We had booked a private room with bath that turned out to be ridiculously small and depressing, with a tiny closet pushed up against the only window. We were disappointed, but decided that we wouldn't be in our rooms much anyway, so what would it matter? Besides, the price was right and we weren't expecting anything large or fancy (but it would have been nice if the room looked even remotely as advertsised!). Unfortunately we arrived back to our room that night to find the ceiling leaking and dirty water all over the floor. We were moved to a new room (after much insistance on our part) that was larger, but again it looked nothing like the photos online. We really tried to be good sports about it, not wanting our accomodation to ruin our trip. The breaking point came when my sister woke up with red marks all over her body that were diagnosed as bedbug bites, and a few days later (we'd left by this point) the same thing happened to me. I wish I'd seen these reviews earlier! I wasn't bothered by the location - we walked everywhere and found it pretty central - but I was bothered about the place being so decrepit and dirty, and of course a home to bedbugs. Do not stay here. A bit more searching will turn up places in the same price range, with better reviews. Two friends of ours were also in Amsterdam at the same time and stayed in a tiny room that had charm and was clean and central, and only slightly more expensive that what we'd paid. I wish I remembered the name of it but it's nice to know it's there, and with a little luck (more research really) I'll stay there on my next visit.

<Content>not too bad I stayed in this hotel for two nights in May. I did not stay in a dormitory but in a private room. The room itself was clean and satisfactory with a view over-looking the canal below. In addition, I had my own private bathroom facilities and a working television. I have stayed in many budget hotels in Amsterdam and these luxuries are seldom awarded to the weary-eyed traveller. The staff was friendly and accomodating. The only real downside was the noise level because of the location of the hotel. I did not really have a problem with this becasue I am a deep-sleeper, however, I could understand how someone might. When leaving the hotel the staff asks that you leave your key at the desk. This is becasue of all the theieves and scammers who loiter around the red-light district. You need to practice saying, No, thank you, to the many drug dealers if you plan to frequent this area. All in all, the stay was pleasant and worth the money paid. I would highly advise appropriating a private room if you have the extra coin.

<Content>Bed bugs and blood on sheets. Staff were cheery, but that's probably because they're raking in money for doing absolutely nothing. Bed sheets had blood on them and weren't changed. They don't actually clean the rooms, just spray lemon stuff around. Steer well clear of this place unless skin infections appeal to you. Left covered in bites.

<Content>hovel hellhole!!! don't do it!!!!!!!!!No No No No Nooooooo!!! stayed at this excuse for a hotel a few months ago and would never EVER venture there again. i was visiting the city with another female friend and both of us have a sense of adventure but this was extreme!!! we shared a7 bedded dorm which we appreciated would in no way be private, but i didnéº“t expect the utter filthiness of the place. i passed down the small dirty staircase passing the bathroom (this term is used in the most loosest sense!!) to our room. the room was strewn with dogends and spliff butts, and stank to high heaven. that night it rained and i kid you not, the room was waterlogged!! i had to wade through the water to go to bed! i told the staff but they really didnéº“t give a toss or make any effort to mop it up(though, in fairness, there was so much water a mop wouldéº“ve been useless.). so, i get to my bed and theres a body in there, in my sleeping bag!!! poor fella assumed this was his be because all the others had bodies already occupying them or were bare, no sheets at all. i felt awful but piked him out anyway. i stayed here for2 nights, never washed or showered and slept in my clothes for fear of contamination. the communal basement dorms here should be shut down!!!!!!!!! it truely is a disgrace, and no matter how small your budget, donéº“t stay here. save more money or donéº“t bothere going at all until a later date, staying here would ruin it for you. thats a promise.

<Content>If you are close-minded you will hate it For the price, 100euros or less, this is a great hotel. It is in the red light district, which is not as bad as poeple say it is. I have never seen a taxi that would not go there. I have been to A Dam several times, and this is one of the cleaner, friendlier hotels I have stayed in. If you didn't know, there are prostitues and drugs in A Dam, unless you just stay in your hotel, you will see it. This hotel is like being on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, close to the action. If you get robbed, it is probably your own fault, even if you don't admit it. Great for people that are younger, and open-minded.

<Content>Inmates in prisons get better facilities than this hovel On our arrival at 'Camp Delta' our travelling party was thrilled to see the extent of the road renovations being carried out directly in front of our 'Hotel'. Once we had overcome the Kryton factor style sandy assault course and in the apparent safety of our digs we were immediately asked to pay, the reasons for this would become blatantly obvious to us in time. The booking was a ten man room and, as there only turned out to be 8 travelling, we were under the impression that we would get even more room for the ridiculously priced tariff of 700euros. This price was for two nights starting on Friday 10th March. This was advertised through various websites as a discounted rate; 130euros P.P.P.N with 65% discount. Now I am no expert on the rules and regulations of advertising, however I do know that I felt mugged paying the discounted rate. I only wish that i had seen this website a couple of days before travelling.  Due to our early arrival and check in not yet started we were shown to the storage cupboard to place our baggage in. Were were assured that this would be locked and secured. On our arrival back, over 90 minutes when check in was due to start, the room was still not ready and a quick look at the storage cupboard showed that it was insecure. Our patience was beginning to wear a little thin and this was compounded by the apparent lack of interest by staff at the front counter whose concern seemed to have disappeared since we had handed our money over. Finally after a further 20 minutes we were shown our room. The manager tried to put 7 of us in one room and the remaining 1 in another, after a few exchanges he agreed to have another bed put in the main room. On pointing out to the manager that there was an unlocked door which joined another dorm/room to ours his explaination was that it was required to be kept open as the fire doors into the street were located in our room therefore access was needed. However he did reassure us by saying, don't worry, the occupants of the other room know not to come in unless there is a fire. Wonderful, that's ok then! Inside the room there were no storage facilities at all. We were offered storage cupboards outside the room which we originally agreed to take but then retracted it after we inspected them and realised that the doors looked like they had been kicked off on numerous occassions. The staff appeared to realise that maybe the security of it's customer/belongings were not top of their list and agreed that they would look after our passports in their safe. The showering and wash facilties were an absolute disgrace with entry gained at the top of a very steep staircase, through the open air then into a concrete shell. This toilet/shower block was constantly dirty with used cigarette ends, dirt on the floor and even sick in the sink. One of our party members brought this to the attention of the management, however it was still in the same state over 4 hours later. It's is easy to understand how the staff at this dive have trouble keeping it clean when i witnessed one cleaner using the firehose from the reception area to get the shower block gleaming!As well as the pathetic excuse for a breakfast and trying to get to sleep with a 300watt fire escape light directly above my head, my one abiding memory from this absolute hell hole of this so called 'hostel' nevermind 'hotel was waking up during the early hours of sunday morning with the unmistakeable noise of a male urinating in the street on the other side of the fire doors. I looked up from my drunken slumber to see that YES it was infact the icing on the cake for my stay and had breached the gap underneath our fire doors and was winging it's way rapidly down the two remaining stairs and towards my bed.Take Me Home.A thoughrougly unenjoyable stay.Don't book this place. Remember this was 8 lads on a 30th birthday and we thought it was crap!!!

<Content>Be warned!! We cancelled our stay here after reading the reviews on this site and booked another hotel. I am glad we did. When we walked through the Red Light district we saw this hotel. It is right in the middle of the famous district, not on the edge as stated. Although I cannot comment on conditions inside the hotel, I can certainly comment on what we saw from the outside. There is a lot of construction going on right outside the hotel. The pathway has been dug up and there are boards across which you have to walk on to get up the steps to the hotel. Not great when you have to carry your luggage. There were also some dodgy looking characters sitting in the hotel by the window. Would not advise anyone who wanted a decent sleep to stay here. Clubs, bars, ladies in the windows etc, all around this hotel. Be warned!!!

<Content>Definately the Heart!!!!! This hotel is right in the Heart of the red light district. The taxi driver refused to take us there!!!! The room we had was at the top of the 'hotel' the very small window overlooked a brothel. The stairs were rickety very small and very winding. The electrics left a bit to be desired. There were definately some 'characters' walking around the 'hotel'. The bathroom was full of mildew and really did not make you want to go into it. The bed sheets were cleanish, but we left with flea bites. Would definately not recommend this 'hotel' to anyone and certainly not one I will be going anywhere near in future.

<Content>Do NOT stay at this Hostel (not a Hotel at all) Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, well put it this way that it is not what I expected, after reading the review on the website, I thought it was people just moaning, and because i was going Amsterdam to sight see just need somewhere to sleep ! Well I wish I didnt book it, I booked through Expedia, where I payed the full amount, so I could not change or cancel or I would have definitely left early.Arrived at the hotel, took ages to check in, had to walk so many stairs (no lift) with a big suitcase, whilst going up the stairs there was a hoover on the stair case, I nearlly fell down until my mate moved it and helped me with my luggage. Trying to find our room, there were so many things on the stairs and corriders (dirty towels/bed sheets) but we still laughed it off.Walked into the room and felt like crying, it was horrible, so small, little bunk beds, cheap flooring, opened the windows, realised we were next to a dirty cinema and opposite the red light bit. The room smelt of the class C drug.The bed sheets were so dirty, dreded to sleep there at night, however we thought it would be fine. The first night was so horrible, so loud outside, beware of the works being done in the canal, they start at 6 am! And no double glazed windows means you can hear everything ! In the morning I had red spots all over my my legs and arms, before someone wrote about bed bugs and scabbies (I did not believe it), well this is exactly what I have, after going to the pharmacy they confirmed this, I cannot believe it, I know for a fact they did not change the bed sheet for the days we were there.The breakfast in the morning was okay, the staff were okay as well, friendly and always smiling, the breakfast could do abit better, but who can complain when your whole body is itching from the night before. The only thing I can say is do not stay here no matter how cheap, go to a better hotel and pay the little bit more, its well worth it. The only positive thing about the hotel is the location and how close it is to everything !If you are staying here good luck, and take a sleeping bag or something !!

<Content>not for the faint hearted we stayed in this hovel for two nights altho we paid for four (we moved out to a much nicer place only five euros a night more) it is without doubt the most disgusting hotel (I use the term loosely) we have ever experienced it has nothing whatsoever going for it although we came away uninfested there was a definite infestation in the matresses wich were also badly worn almost threadbear i spent many years of my life working as a coal miner so i am used to dirty conditions but to have to walk across an open yard to shower in a cold shed that smells like an open sewer was something else .The breakfast was appalling as well cereals but no milk, baskets of rotting fruit and coffee in plasic vending cups, and some kind of fruit cake no toast just bread .The hut in auf weidersen pet had more going for it than this in a nutshell cold damp dirty smelly be warned .
