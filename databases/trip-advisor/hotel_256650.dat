<Content>OK but look into the details... We stayed in an Executive Terrace Suite for one night and came away pretty disappointed. Our $415 room was quite nice - roomy, clean, comfy bed, some signs of wear but overall pretty good. The problem came when our nice expensive room happened to be directly under the 9th floor function room, and being a Saturday night, there was a 21st or something going on. Needless to say it's hard to have a romantic getaway when the dance version of who let the dogs out etc is blaring through your room for most of the evening. And it's hard to sleep when there's people thumping around the hallways and the music permeating your room until the wee hours of the morning..The staff were friendly but unable to offer a Sunday morning breakfast suggestion other than McDonalds, saying everything else would be closed. (Hint: walk to Circular Quay, plenty of great choices). The restaurant was closed since there was a function on in the 3rd floor dining room as well. All in all we're pretty disappointed at what we got for the amount of money spent. The room was nice and this hotel may be suitable if you're away from the 3rd/9th floor function rooms or staying when there is unlikely to be functions on...

<Content>Fantastic Stayed here just the one night in a the deluxe room. The room was much bigger than I was expecting, very modern and clean. I loved everything about the room and the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and the mini bar was the best I've seen!It cost $30 to have my car in the carpark over night, be aware that the carpark is in the street behind the hotel, we discovered this after driving around for about 10 minutes trying to get to the hotel, just to be told the carpark wasnt there. This was a bit annoying. Also when I wanted to leave the next day I was blocked in by another car (the hotel has very limited parking spaces and more cars than they really should), and apparently the staff had forgotten to collect their keys, so I had to wait while they tracked down the owner (who was in his room luckily for me) who came down with the key so I could get out.Besides the car parking situation everything else about this hotel was brilliant! Although I wouldnt stay here on the weekend if you werent planning a big night yourself, as it was a bit noisy (music still playing at 3am). Didnt bother us though since the location was why we stayed there!!Definitely will stay there again.

<Content>Clean, modern and centrally-located I booked this hotel on wotif.com and really liked it. It was a 2-story loft, in dark, sleek colors. I thought the amenities were good - restaurant / bar, in-room kitchen and lots of toiletries. The only thing I would update are the TVs - they were a bit outdated so the sound quality was poor.

<Content>Black mood about the Blacket First impressions of our smartly decorated albeit dingy room with a view over a multi-storied construction site on the corner of King and Geoge St's in the heart of Sydney's CBD were good but unfortunately didn't last for very long.We stayed in the Blacket over the Queens Birthday weekend and now wished we hadn't.Although the reception staff were lovely and very helpful with details about getting around Sydney they were not forthcoming with information other than about breakfast arrangements.We were given a key and left to our own devices to port our luggage and find our room.The mattress was saggy and in need of replacement,the blankets old and felted, the toilet continued to run after being flushed, the soaps were the size of thumbnails and the shower water was not always hot.The heating system rattled noisily.The television was positioned on a bracket on the wall, in such a stupid position, at a height that my companion nearly managed to knock himself out on three times.The complimentary bottle of wine on arrival had to be ordered at reception (which we didn't do) and there was no free bottled drinking water available for international tourists with sensitive stomaches (or us), in the minibar. We probably could have overlooked some of these shortcomings had we not expected a central Sydney CBD boutique hotel experience of at least a minimum standard. Although we kept our room in the hotel on Saturday night we were out until Sunday morning. We were not impressed with the dried vomit on the carpet in the hallway leading to our room when we returned on Sunday morning but were keen to get some sleep after being out all night and ignored it. On Sunday evening we planned to stay in, have an early night and either eat at the inhouse restaurant ''Level Threeor dial up some room service. It wasn't until Sunday evening we discovered by ringing reception that there was no room service on a Sunday evening and 'Level Threewas closed to guests due to a private function.The private funtion at Level Three on the floor below us went until 4am on Monday morning, not only depriving us of an inhouse dinner but making it impossible to sleep with the loud, thumping disco music that continued until stumps at 4am.The music and loud inebriated voices pumped through our room like a nightmare depriving us of any chance of sleep. The continental breakfast was an abysmal affair in the cold room that only hours earlier had hosted the private function. The bread like cardboard, inedible even toasted. The handle of one of the two toasters available to the guests fell off in my companions hands as he valiantly tried to cobble a breakfast together.We didn't bother trying to order a decent coffee or eggs a la carte, by that stage we were thoroughly over the contempt the Blacket demonstrates for their guests needs.Staying at the Blacket put me in a very black mood indeed. It's an experience that my companion and I will not be repeating in our lifetimes and we hope that we can spare you a similar adventure at this particular central Sydney 'boutique hotel.

<Content>Good Value Booked this hotel as I was attending a meeting at the Westin and I wanted to be close by but not stay there - I wanted a place that was inexpensive, yet spacious, clean, quiet and the Blacket fit the crieria perfectly. For $130/night ( wotif) for their deluxe room. lots of pubs, restaurants, takeway places nearbly- Coles supermarket across the road. The room had a cutlery, plates, which came in useful. Bathroom immaculately clean.

<Content>Great place Myself and my boyfriend stayed at the Blackett over the New Year period in 2005/06. It was tucked away just off George Street and from the outside it didn't really amout to much, but once inside we found the staff to be helpful and the room was large (although like others have said dark coloured decor and minimal) which we found vto be clean and simple, we liked that. The rooms are very quiet, and no noise was heard on New Years Eve after we returned despite the parties going on until late. We enjoyed the breakfast, very efficient staff. We would definately recommend The Blacket if you want to be very central (probably 20 mins walk to circular Quay, loads of buses) but also have the peace and quiet once in your room.

<Content>A good find The hotel was in a great location on the junction of George and King Street in the CBD. It was surrounded by shops and there were plenty of pubs serving good food nearby. Darling Harbour was a short walk away. Circular Quay was slightly further but still within walking distance.My husband and I stayed in a studio room for 5 nights in January 2007. The room was large with minimalist decor and dark walls. I agree with some of the other reviews that the rooms looked a bit tired. The kitchenette was very handy and tea/coffee was free of charge. The room was extremely quiet - we heard absolutely no noise from the busy streets below or from within the hotel. The studio looked down onto the street and across to a building which was being renovated and therefore covered in scaffolding.Continental breakfast consisted of fruit juice, tea, coffee, a selection of cereals, breads, pastries and fresh fruit and only cost æ‹¢3.00 per person. Overall, the location and room suited us fine and we felt it was good value for money. The dark minimalist rooms wouldn't be to everyone's taste though.

<Content>Good location but now looking dated Stayed at the Blacket for 7 nights from the 28.12.06, we were charged a huge supplement for New Year and were annoyed to find the hotel restaurant was closed, the only choice for breakfast was an over priced continental breakfastLeaking ceiling took 4 days to fixLocation is great, room was large but very drab. The hotel was probally cool a few years ago but is now looking old and tired.Staff are helpful but no room service or help with your bags.Overall Ok but if you are loooking for a spacious room in a central location.

<Content>Central location, uncommon decor Great central location in the heart of Sydney, at the intersection of two main streets. I stayed in a back room which avoided the traffic noise at the expense of a view (in fact my window was a greyed-out piece of glass) The room was huge (no kidding) but the grey-black decor got on my nerves somewhat. As others said, the rooms have a 'minimalist' furnishing style, which might please some but not others. Staff was friendly. Overall, fair value for money; but I'd prefer to stay in a different hotel next time with a more natural decor.

<Content>Hip Hotel missing the basic service My husband and I recently stayed at The Blacket hotel on our trip to Australia. The rooms are nice with a kitchenette but, forget regular services! We were mis-directed one night to a dinner (given wrong directions by the front desk), 24 hrs of internet service cost $35 USD and we had to call the Concierge to get a wine opener which eventually showed up. There is a large construction site directly across from the Hotel on George Street so, don't expect good views. The breakfast is overpriced so, you are better to go to one of the local cafes. The hotel is centrally located at the corner of George and King Streets which makes it a 5-7 min. walk to the Quay and the Rocks. Given Sydney hotel prices this isn't the least expensive but it certainly isn't the most expensive either. If you can do without services and want a centrally located hip hotel this is the place. If you are looking for quiet this is not the place to stay.

<Content>Great location, cold environment For location this place cannot be beat- halfway between Circular Quay and the Town Hall on the main downtown drag. Very modern hotel with all the modern accompaniments (sp?). Minimalist furnishings, stark lobby, nthing warm and fuzzy. However, our room was clean and the hotel was easy to use for people like us who appreciate annonimity.

<Content>great location We stayed here twice on our OZ tour.Five days at the beginning and five days at the end.The plus points are the location and the staff who were always helpful and friendly.We had an executive terrace room which we found spacious and comfortable.Yes it is minimilist but how much furniture do you need in a room.Having said that the hotel rooms do seem to be in the process of being upgraded and I would think the hotel should invest in some LCD screens and better audio systems.There were some problems with noise from the parties that were on on the rooftop level of the hotel and this did go on to the early hours of the morning on a couple of occasions.I felt that the hotel should have at least explained that we may be disturbed if there was a party on and they did apologise after the event.Overall though we were happy and would return again.

<Content>Exactly what we were looking for... Wonderful stay at the Blacket Hotel. Reception staff were just fantastic.. just normal down to earth girls. The room was great! We had a two bedroom apartment which was on the corner and looked down George and King Street which gave the room an extra demension. The place was clean and well equipt and had all the things we needed for our girls weekend in Sydney. The bathroom was big and the water pressure was nice and hard which made us all smile! We had a separate toilet which was handy as we were all hogging the mirror(which was huge) to do the hair so it was convienent to have a extra toilet. The only issue i had was there was not enough power points in the bathroom for all our hair dryer and straighteners etc. but thats a girl thing. Also the girls complained that there wasnt enough blankets on their beds and they got cold in the night but their were spares in the cupboard. I expected to be disturbed by some doof-doof from the nightclub next door howevr it was audible from the lift and corridor but not our room.. besides we didnt get in till 6am so it didnt affect us much at all. Anyway i will definately stay at the Blacket again as it was very reasonably priced and in a great spot as the city in every direction was at our doorstep!

<Content>Great Central Location....However more of a serviced apartment than a hotel... Have stayed at the Blacket twice, the second time in one of the Executive Terrace Suites. As per previous comments rooms are sparse and pretty basic however have all that you need. Great location in central Sydney perfect if working in the CBD. Terrace suits, as the name suggests, have a fantastic terrace, with great views of downtown Sydney (no Harbour views) that would probably cater for 30 people comfortably. So if you need to do some entertaining you couldn't go far wrong.That said if you are looking for any support from the staff forget it, pleasant enough however if someone said it was a training ground for the more established Sydney hotels I would believe it. As such if you treat it more like a serviced apartment rather than a hotel you will be less disappointed with the attention to detail and overall level of service.Still if you are looking for a great central location, pleasant rooms, an aversion to chain hotels and are a reasonable independent guest then you could do worse.

<Content>Just ok This hotel has mistaken the concept of minimalism for skimping on the furniture. Service is shoddy, The place needs a bit of a renovation, very tiered. However it is in a good location and does the job.

<Content>Excellent for CBD business or holiday Stay there! - it's excellent value for money if you're looking for somewhere very central. I was attending a meeting in the NRMA tower and it took me less than two minutes (including waiting for the crosswalk) to get there from the front door of the hotel.I paid $130 for the night (April 10, 2006) which I reckon is remarkably low. If you're on a budget and don't want to spend big on eating out, walk two short blocks up the road to the 24 hour Coles supermarket, you'll save a heap on food. Or get a pub meal from the multitude of drinking spots around it. This may not mean much to expense account wielding business travellers but if you want a bit of luxury without going silly on a daily rate, I recommend it. It's very clean, modern and well equipped. I have stayed in the wonderful old Grace hotel, just 40m away, and whilst I like old world charm, it's not worth paying $150 a day more, in my opinion, especially if you're on holiday. That could cover your hire car or cab fares instead.With only 42 rooms, varying from standard to swish suites, it would make sense to book well ahead. I didn't, my travel agent fluked it and I'm glad she did. I will certainly use it again for business and even travelling with the kids - litle legs get very tired after a few hours and you could duck back for a rest and then out again easily. Parking I don't know about but call them. There is a gym nearby apparently too.One unexpected bonus - being a former bank (hence it's central location) it's really very quiet - my room boarded on spooky 'cos it was so hushed so bone up on your conversation skills if travelling with family, there will be few distractions from outside the room.If the cabbie gets lost, tell him / her, Take me to the Grace Hotel or the NRMA Tower and once there, you'll look up and see the relatively discreet signage. Speaking with the front office staff, they commented that many clients were repeat customers and I can see why. Last thing - they have 24 hour reception, but they shut the doors at midnight. Don't bash the doors like I did(it's an ex-bank, they won't hear you!)just press the button next to the door - duh!

<Content>Great location, terrific value Absolutely all we wanted - clean, spacious apartment, centrally located, very good value. Very helpful staff (inc looking after luggage after early AM arrival from UK until check in). Had seen some reviews beforehand mentioning noise from a nightclub - but not a dicky bird in the three nights we stayed. TIP - go to the Rocks Cafe for breakfast (10-15 mins walk but so worth it).

<Content>Great Central Boutique Hotel Stayed for 2 nights back in August. Hotel decor is 'minimalist' in design, but very comfortable.Great 2 bed apartment - comfy beds, clean and spacious bathroom with very good shower, and a handy well equipped kitchenette area. It was particularly good for a family as we were able to be together but had plenty of space and our own rooms.Very well placed in CBD with easy walks to all important tourist attractions (15 - 20 mins to Circular Quay).Staff were friendly and helpful. Noise was not an issue for us, but we were on a lower level with great views of George St.This was a great hotel in an excellent location and for a really good price!!

<Content>Perfect combination of reasonable and chic/modern My wife and I spent 10 nights at the Blacket and I wouldn't have stayed anywhere else. We spent a lot of time searching for a centrally located, modern/chic hotel for a reasonably rate and this is one of the few ones that we found. It only cost about $140 US per night for a great room. This hotel is right in the heart of the CBD and is a 15-20 minute walk to anything of importance in downtown Sydney from the opera to the park to the wharf.Bathrooms are nicely designed and clean. The staff is very friendly. If getting Internet service they are one of the few hotels that allows you to buy Internet access and use it over the entire length of your stay. You dont have to use it all within a specific timeframe.One thing is make sure to check out a couple of room options once you arrive. The first room we checked into was large but really dark and more expensive than the second room we checked into. I would recommend something on the 7th floor.Negatives: The breakfast is not worth having and the dining room while nice looking does not serve good food.

<Content>Fab and easy. Great service, good rooms, cool bar. Easy-peasy relaxed place to stay. Clean place and very comfy huge beds! Very central and close to the harbour areas. Decent breakfast. Didn't have a glorious green view out of window, no bath, but so what, it's the CBD. Very handy for enjoying the Sydney nightlife, Darlinghurst Harbour and heaps of restaurants are nearby - just a short easy walk away. It's not that far to walk to the Sydney Bridge and Opera House either.

<Content>Stylish, central and reasonably priced My husband and I stayed for 3 nights in a standard double room and were positively surprised! The hotel is extremely reasonably priced and very central - within walking distance from most sights. The rooms are huge, decorated in a trendy minimalistic style and our room had an enormous bathroom. The staff were very helpful and welcoming and the room was cleaned to a high standard every day. Apart from the normal minibar our room also had a sink and cutlery, cups, plates ect. which was great for preparing little snacks. There's a Coles supermarket just across the road on George Street which is great if you're on a budget and don't want to eat expensive meals out. As others have mentioned this hotel has its own bar/club which was a little bit loud in the evening, but by no means that loud that you couldn't fall asleep. It didn't bother us and we'll certainly be going back to this gem of a hotel.

<Content>Great hotel, great location My wife and I stayed here for four days in the penthouse apartment. The apartments are very reasonably priced and ours had a huge terrace overlookinng George Street and a spa bath over looking the terrace. (Ask for the eighth floor executive suites)The staff were very accomodating and helpful. Rooms are clean and stylish. The location is very good and away from the very touristy harbour area. One word of warning, if you want early nights don't go for the penthouse apartments as there is a rooftop club on the next floor up, connected to the hotel.We stayed here at the start of our trip for one night and booked it for the final four nights of our trip as we liked it so much.

<Content>Good hotel in a perfect location Stayed here for five nights over the new year. Overall a good hotel in a perfect location for easy walking access to all the attractions in sydney. Loft apartments are well decorated with a spotless bathroom and jacuzzi bath. Previous reviews are way off the mark about the hotel and rooms being tatty.Only minor complaint would be that it took a while for the air con to crank up and the lack of drawers.....hardly show stoppers!

<Content>Loud but Enjoyable We arrived at the Hotel for at 2:30 for a 3pm checkin but couldnt get in until 4. Staff were apologetic and offered us complimentery breakfast which was nice of them. We stayed in loft room which was very spacious, clean and decorated well. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were really nice. Only major complaint is that we could hear the beats from the club downstairs until 3 in the morning. It wasnt very loud but loud enough to be slightly annoying. This would be a good place to stay if you were going clubbing and planned on having a late one. All in all it was an enjoyable stay but for a romantic night in the city there are better places to stay. Check wotif/lastminute etc.. for some good rates.

<Content>The way Hotels Should be Decorated Just Stayed at the Blacket for 3 nights. Very good quality Hotel. It is tucked away and not that well known. I have been to Sydney a few times but had never heard of the Blacket, but once you stay there you will stay again. The rooms are pleasant on the eye and very modern. The standard Deluxe room looks just like the photos posted on the web sites. Good gentle lighting in the rooms/hotel areas Bathroom is also modern and easy on the eye when you look in the mirror!! Very close walking distance to George Street Shopping, Monorail I learnt that you don't neccessarily have to stay at the big well known Hotel chains to enjoy a hotel that has everything you need. Great Value when you book last minute through wotif or other sites.

<Content>tired looking this hotel is more than a little scruffy, for the money there are tidier places to stay. the decor and finishes are on the poorer side of ikea. lots of carpet stains not to mention thread bare fabrics and chipped scuffed paint all over the place, cracked and aging grout tiles in the bathroom. time for a refit mr blacket whomever you are! tacky scratched and peeling stickers inside the elevators. what else can i say exept that this made me too scared to contemplate the in house cuisine?!

<Content>One Terrific Hotel! We stayed at the Blacket Hotel last month for two nights. It is a terrific place! We were given a very large suite, complete with a small kitchenette and a washing machine. As others have stated, the decor is quite handsome and prices are reasonable. I particularly liked that the hotel isn't large and is conveniently located within the downtown CBD.Hope I get to return!

<Content>Fantastic hotel, recommended The hotel is very modern in decor. The staff at reception were friendly and helpful. The hotel room was spacious, spotlessly clean and again very modern. The bathroom was bright and clean with a wicked walk in shower. I would recommend this hotel as an ideal base in which to explore the city. It's a central location for all the attractions. I would definitely stay here again - give it a try yourself if you like the modern and funky style hotel!

<Content>Exceptional service This hotel is the best boutique place I have stayed on my travels thus far. We were originally only going to stay for 3 nights but extended to almost 2 weeks. The rooms are very chic,spacious (photos on site don't do them justice) spotless bathrooms with walk in showers. The location is brilliant, great for city dwellers and not more than 10 minutes walk in either direction for darling harbour and the rocks. The reception were very helpful and pleasant. I was extremely nervous about staying in the city because I didn't know what to expect since it was my first trip to sydney, but once I arrived at the blacket I felt very safe and there was no trouble on king street nor did we hear the rowdiness of the street from our room. I would definately stay here the next time I visit sydney
