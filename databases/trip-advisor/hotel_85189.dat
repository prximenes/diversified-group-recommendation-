<Content>Mixed Review ... Not too good though. OK ... I booked this hotel for a one-night stopover in Miami on the way to St. Maarten. I selected it because it was close to the airport and although there were some negative reviews ... the pictures looked nice enough. This hotel has seen better days. It appears that it was once on a main highway or thoroughfare and was probably built as a motor inn type accomodation. The room was clean enough ... I didn't have issues with that ... and the bed was comfortable enough for a one night stay over. The morning shuttle service to the airport was fine ... but good grief ... even after calling the hotel twice we waited about 45 minutes for the shuttle from the airport and when it finally arrived the driver PACKED it ridiculously full ... to the point that I felt it was unsafe. If the driver had to stop quickly etc. the people standing would have been toppling all over and the driver even packed luggage onto the entrance stairs of the shuttle so if people would have had to exit quickly ... there would have been no way out! It appeared that many of the guests that night had been put up by American Airlines due to flight problems and that's probably why the shuttle was overloaded. When we arrived there were about 35 people trying to check in and only one desk agent. Upon arrival ( about 9:30 pm) the hotel lobby was very nice, we checked into our room and went down to the lounge for a cocktail and hoped to have some dinner or a snack. The young man tending bar did not know how to make hardly a single drink. Mojito, anything that involved mixing was beyond him. Basically you got beer, wine, or something very simple. I could live with that but wasn't thrilled. He was pleasant enough and in his defense we were told he was filling in. He turned out to be the bus-boy at breakfast the next morning so .... We finally got frustrated and went to the raucous seafood eaterie next door and had great drinks and it looked like they had good food but we didn't eat. The next morning we were up early for our shuttle to the airport and went to breakfast at the restaurant. Terrible. It was buffet only and for $10 you could have cereal, juice, toast, and coffee. For an extra $5 you could have fresh fruit, and some hot items, none of which were very good and a couple of which were unidentifiable and basically inedible. It was weird because the waiters were wearing tuxedos and there were nice linens etc. and yet the food was worse than you would find at a local buffet for $7.99 where I live. It seems like this hotel is run by a family ... all of the people that were working at night were also there early in the morning ... and I certainly don't begrudge a hard working family for trying to make a living ... but I think they get most of their business from American Airlines putting people up after flight delays/canellations ... and those travellers don't have a choice so the service reflects that. All in all ... this hotel met my needs ... all I needed was a stopover for a night that was close to the airport. But I would DEFINATELY not book this accomodation as a destination hotel in the Miami area. As a side note ... the pool area looked quite nice but I wasn't in a position to take a swim or anything.

<Content>nasty nasty nasty A nasty hotel and horrible staff. I too was sent there by American Airlines after they cancelled my flight. I knew what type of hotel it was going to be after experiencing the shuttle driver who was extremely rude and drove erratically. The hotel lobby looks ok but the rooms are disgusting. They are very old and obviously has never been refurbished in a long time. Breakfast was horrible, hot food was stone cold.Shame on AA for putting their inconvenienced passengers in a disgraceful hotel like this. DO NOT STAY HERE.

<Content>Their staffs stole things from my luggage!!! I stayed in this hotel after my cruise. First of all, the girl at the front desk gave me a room that was not cleaned yet, the cleaning maid told us to go to some other room instead, so I had to go down and talk to the girl at the front to get the key for this other room... the security door to the belcony wasn't working, the safe was not working in this room... the biggest issue, after I returned home, I found out that I missed two items from my luggage, one is a perfume that I bought from the bath and body shop, and a guess wallet... I got these from a miami mall... I bought other stuffs from the ship (Shiseido products, clinique, lacoste) and they were still in the luggage.. I was just missing the two things that I bought in a local miami mall... we went out the morning before we checked out and when we went out, the maid saw us walked out... I seriously believe someone went into our room and open our luggage and stole!!!! Geez, I can't believe this happened to me, the items are not expensive, but it's hard to believe someone work in the hotel would do stuffs like that... I am going to file a complaint to the manager, I know nothing might change, but still I think I need to inform them that some of their staffs are stealing from customers' luggage... so if you are staying in this hotel.. be aware! Thank God I brought all the money and passport with me all the time...

<Content>A convenient stopover I recently had to make a quick stopover near the Miami Airport and chose this hotel based on the Regency reputation. It was the perfect quick fix for my needs. It had all the amenities I needed including highspeed internet, and great breakfast, good food in the restaurant, a very comfortable and well appointed room, and the staff was very friendly and efficient. I would highly recommend this for business travelers passing thru the Miami area.

<Content>Nasty hotel, nasty staff. American Airlines put us up for the night in this horrible hotel. Wasnt expecting much, since it was free -- but I would have paid to NOT stay at this place. The shuttle from the airport to the hotel was over an hour wait. We saw every other hotel shuttle drive by 3 times, before ours finally arrived. While we were checking in, the staff was rude and not very accommodating. There were no toothbrushes in their vending machines, they wouldnt open the gift store to sell me one, and they directed me to the gas station across the street to buy one-- and it was very late at night.They claim to have non-smoking rooms, yet all of the 3 rooms we tried out reeked of smoke. The person at the front desk was very irritated with us for trying different rooms. We finally gave up and just took the last room-- which had a bed that also smelled of smoke.Room was very dirty and old. After pulling back the old dirty blanket, the bed had brown crumbs in it-- I slept in my street clothes. The bathroom was old, dirty and had a very moldy shower. There was a lot of noise outside all night long. Our 4:30 a.m. requested wake-up call to get the airport for our morning flight was completely ignored, so it was a good thing I couldnt get to sleep.Should AA be putting you up for the night, I would request to not stay in this hotel! AA should be made aware of these reviews and remove this hotel from their partnership.

<Content>We loved our stay at the Airport Regency We stayed 4 nights at this hotel the service was excellent. Breakfast very good.if you like to have a glass of wine free of charge every night you could have one from 6pm to 7pm. Th service in the hotel was excellent. We like the idea that you had free transport to and from airport to hotel every half hour. Staff were very friendly even though it was hard to understand them sometimes. When we were leaving they gave us a plate of fresh fruit .if staying in miami again we would stay a the airport Regency.

<Content>OK stay if your stuck Like so many posts we were directed here via American Airlines after missing our flight.To tell the truth it was ok.The room had obviously been recently upgraged and was clean and tidy.The seafood restaurant next door was fine and the breakfast in the hotel the next day was again ok. At the end of the day it was a cheap overnight stay near a airport!! The $60 or so we paid by UK standards is a give away ,try getting that back home...not a chance. All in all a OK stay. For the posts that state that American Airlines should be ashamed,really given the quality of their flights are you suprised !!

<Content>never again ! same as many people, i was sent there by american airlines with a discount voucher. even with it, it remained very expensive for the kind of hotel : old fashioned, not very clean and the worse was the restaurant that we paid ourselves as american airlines let us down. the food was truly awful and we sent our 2 plates back to the kitchen : the fries were uncooked, the vegetables were still half frozen, the steak was burned and the fish disgusting. the chef cooked us two other meals but it was the same so we gave up and went to bed exhausted without eating. please change the kitchen staff !!!!

<Content>Not great Most of the staff had a poor command of English. I asked for an ice machine and was almost sent down the street to a gas station because they thought I was asking for an automatic teller machine. The Cuban music at the restaurant next door started at 10 PM or so and didn't quit until after midnight. Not good if you want to catch an early flight. On the good side they did allow us to check in early and the room was clean.

<Content>Comfortable I spent two nights here in October 2007 because of a discount voucher from American airlines when my flight was cancelled. I thought the room (308) looked clean and well kept until I saw a mouse scamper across the room. Comfortable beds. Hotel restaurant was expensive for dinner. They added 15% service charge without there being any mention of a forced service charge on the menu. It's a lot cheaper to get a tasty meal at the Latin cafe if you walk about 5 minutes to the right of the hotel and cross the road, and meals to go are also available there. Free computers with internet on 2nd floor (access via stairs from lobby)

<Content>Less than impressed After a cancelled flight in Miami, I chose the Airport Regency because they accepted a dicount voucher from my airline. The hotel is not well-equipped for business travelers - very poor internet access in the lobby and none available in the rooms (though they advertise that there is). Overall the room was pretty shabby - old sheets and curtains. Expensive and not very good breakfast.

<Content>referred by American Airlines due to Cancelled Flight Due to FAA problem with no radio controlled my flight back to Nashville, Tn. was cancelled on 9/25/07. Was referred by American Airlines to stay at the Miami Regency Hotel for one night. Since I have been in the travel industry for approx. twenty years, I knew nothing about this particular property. Upon arrival to the hotel the lobby area was clean and very well kept. My room was #406 and the room was clean but the ottoman had a stain on it. Not for sure what that was about. Also, I did enjoy the hot breakfast buffet at $15.00 per person. Overall, I was glad that I had some where to stay as a crash pad due to cancelled flight because the American Airlines Ticket agent suggested that I spend the night in the Miami Airport.

<Content>Not a very nice hotel American Airlines gave us a discount voucher for this hotel after we missed our connecting flight and had to rebook for the next morning. We spent 40 minutes waiting for the shuttle at the airport. The lobby of the hotel was nice so we thought our room would be okay, but maybe they are putting people with discount vouchers in the worst rooms. The hallway carpet had several stains. The carpet and the chair in the room were also stained and the mattress sagged terribly in the middle. The air conditioning in our room didn't work, though it made a lot of noise. We hardly slept but were too physically exhausted to move rooms. Take note that they automatically add 15% gratuity in the restaurant, though they don't tell you. Arrive early for the shuttle to the airport in the morning! It started to leave early since it was full, then we were told to get off the shuttle since no one could be standing for the trip. This would be fine if they made everyone get off the shuttle who was standing but they let the other man who was standing stay! If the air conditioning had worked, this place probably would have been worth our discounted price of $69+tax, but if you are looking for anything nicer, look elsewhere.

<Content>Shame on American Airlines for using this hotel! Im only giving this 2 stars because the lobby is nice, and the room we originally got was a smoke smelly room..even though it was a non smoking floor, and they did change to a non smelly room. Otherwise, not suggested to stay there. Let me start by saying shame on you American Airlines for using this hotel. We were cancelled on a flight due to weather, and AA put us here with a voucher. I would have gladly spent double the $69 that AA suggested, had I known about this hotel. The room was very outdated. Looks like something from the 70's. The bed was not comfortable, and the sheets were so thin, and rough, i was afraid to sleep on it. My wife and I slept in our clothes, as we werent sure of what else may be on the sheets. The bathroom needed work all around. Caulking was missing and the floor looked dirty. I did see some cigarette burns on the counters, so at one point it was a smoking room. We had to turn on the air conditioning high before we fell asleep to cool the room, as it was so loud, there was no way we could have slept thru it. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel, other than the lobby and bar. Spend the extra $50-60 to stay somewhere else, and if AA offers it, do yourself a favor...ask for a voucher somewhere else.

<Content>Really Run Down Stayed here at airline's expense after a late plane caused me to miss a connection. Not a bargain even free. Lobby is O.K. and staff pleasant, but rooms are really run down. Shower drain so slow bathtub half filled with water during shower. Definitely don't pay to stay here.

<Content>Beds were Nice- Pretty Avg Place Though Hotel was average. The room I had was the standard hotel room. The bedding was nice (it did not have those normal ugly comforters you see in all hotels, this was fluffy and I slept well). Hotel staff wasmediocre, nothing to brag about but atleast everything went favorablewith checkin/checkout. However, I did need a toothbrush for the nightand the hotel does not supply anything like that as curtosity (like razors, etc.). You must buy it at the little store in the lobby whereall the prices are WAY expensive and of cheap quality. A small bottled water in the store cost over $2.00. Continental breakfast wasfine- eggs, yogurt, toast, etc. The 1 shuttle to the airport leaves every 30 mins on the dot!

<Content>Ugh! American Airlines booked me here after a cancellation. I've stayed at some bad hotels in developing or 3rd world countries, and this is still the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Bathroom was dirty enough that I skipped the shower. The bed was uncomfortable, but (hopefully) clean. When I stepped over to the armchair to lay some clothes on it, I stepped into a soaking wet spot on the carpet. No idea what the liquid was-- saw no ceiling leak, and wasn't near the AC.Staff was incredibly rude and at times difficult to communicate with due to language barrier. I arrived at noon, and for the rest of the day the gift shop was never open to allow me to buy a toothbrush.Restaurant in-house was really bad.

<Content>Airlines should be ashamed!! After getting bumped off American Airlines several times in one day, they finally gave us a discount voucher for $69.00 per night to stay at the Airport Regency. The three of us waited, with two other people, over 45 minutes for the Regency's shuttle to pick us up. As we waited we saw shuttles from other hotels go by at least five times. As soon as the the van pulled up it was like a scene from The Night of the Living Dead. People appeared from nowhere to get on the shuttle and were banging on the door to get in. As we drove by different terminals people were rushing the van trying to get on! When we arrived we noticed the lighted sign on the hotel had a few letters unlit which read Airpor engncy otel This was a bad omen!! Like many others we were impressed at the lobby. The staff was dressed impeccably so we thought it may not be so bad. Check in was easy and even though it was 11:00PM the restaurant was still open. They said there was no room service (even though the hotel directory said it was available) so we ordered our meal and brought it to our room. So far so good. Our room looked ok when we first walked in but as we got settled we realized how filthy it was! There was black hair all over the bathroom and the toilet seat was stained yellow. We only had two, rough, thin, towels and one washcloth. Since we didn't pack some of our toiletries on our carry on (stupid me!) we asked if they had any and of course they didn't. The blankets were pilled and had thin areas where you could see through them. As for the bedspread, we didn't even want to touch it! We needed to get up at 5:00 AM to catch the shuttle and called to get a wake up call. We tried for the next hour and no one ever picked up! Yes, there was an alarm clock but since major thunderstorms were going on we were worried about the power going off. In the morning the shuttle filled up quickly so the driver decided to retrieve the bus shuttle instead of using the small the van. He said he's be back in ten minutes and drove off. After 45 minutes he finally came back! We all piled on and people were standing, sitting on laps, standing on the stairs etc. Very unsafe. Oh, and by the way...since the shuttle was so late, we missed our flight! Thanks American Airlines for putting us up in the Airport Regency! It's an experience we'll never forget but wish we could!! We'll be dealing with American Airlines also.

<Content>What a Dump When we arrived at the Airport Regency Hotel the lobby was nice and we were expecting the same with our room. When we got to our room, it was dark and there were stains all over the dark red carpeting. There was black hair all over the bathroom. When I turned on the air conditioner it smelled like wet dog.  We went downstairs to speak with the manager, while waiting at the front desk to be helped, we spoke to other guests in the lobby who were also disappointed with their room and were told that they had paid up to $60 less for their rooms. We requested a new room and asked for a price listing of the rooms. The hotel refused to provide a price list.  The Receptionist and Manager were unfriendly and when we asked questions the Receptionist and Manager spoke between themselves in Spanish before answering. We were told inconsistent information and treated rudly when we asked for a new room.  Our new room was not as dirty as the first but was still very disappointing and there was hair all over the bathroom floor in and in the bathtub. The room was very loud and we could here planes landing and taking off from Miami Int. Airport. We were told that there would be a complimentary breakfast when we booked our room with hotels.com. In the morning the we went downstairs for breakfast and were then told that there was a complimentary breakfast but that our room did not include breakfast. We spoke to the manager again and told him that when we booked we were told that we would be given complimentary breakfast. The manager was unappoligetic and did nothing to help the situation. We left the hotel immediately after this conversation with the manager. I would never stay here again and would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Hotel needs attention We were forced to stay at the Airport Regency Hotel due to a delayed connection flight out of Miami. Our airlines put up up at this hotel for one night. Quite frankly, I was surprised that the airline would even have a contract with this hotel because it really reflicts badly on them. This hotel was very deciving from the lobby. The lobby is furnished very nicely and is quite impressive...untill you open the door to your room. Chipped paint, leaky faucets, dirty windows (inside), badly stained carpet, bathroom tiles missing and just over-all a place that needs to be gutted and renovated. I was almost afraid of sleeping there but I forced myself to do so considering it was free and only for a for one night.If you can find a different hotel, do it.

<Content>Hmm, are talking about the same hotel? After booking two rooms at this hotel, I started reading the reviews and spent some time in panick trying to find an alternative. But the price was so good (198 dollars for 8 persons, two rooms) and the time litlle and since we only was to spend a night I decided finally to live with it. And what a nice suprise! Either I am blind and have lost my smell but I found nothing bad worth mentioning. The staff was nice, the beds were ok, the room was big and the breakfast great, and they even had a free shuttle to the port! i would stay here again and highly recommend it for travellers in need of sleep between airport and cruice.

<Content>No Bargain Here The halls were not vacuumed and smelled like mildew (or?). The sink and tub drains backed up. The leg fell off the chair, the lights were dim and the closet door broke when we first opened it. The room did not come with wash cloths. We requested two and one was delivered promptly to our room. No wash cloths for the second night. The women's toilets in the lobby area were all clogged.

<Content>Where do I begin? The only thing good about this place is the shuttle to the airport and Port of Miami. Though we left a credit card imprint when we checked in, we were required to leave a $20 cash deposit if we wanted to make local phone calls...which you will want to do to order in food from outside the hotel, because you wouldn't want to eat in the restaurant. Just don't call the pizza places on the flyers that greet you daily underneath the room door...they are bogus. When elevators are working, you need a room key to access...or if you are the guy delivering the bogus pizza flyers...just wait until a car comes down and you're scot free! We got a decent group rate...so we weren't expecting much...and they delivered!

<Content>Hotbed Hotel - not for travellers American Airlines put us up here after we missed a connecting flight. What a dump! The halls smelled like vomit, the room wasn't clean, the toilet was stopped up. This is not a single bad instance - we had 6 couples staying there. Not one of them had a good experience. We had to wait for 45 minutes at the airport for the shuttle - watching the Hilton, Comfort Inn, Holiday Inn and 5 other chains pass us 3 times. The driver spoke no English, so our complaints were wasted breath. The restaurant menu was hard to read with all the dried food on it. We opted to go outside the gated facility to eat, instead. We were told the driver would take us or pick us up - later, when calling from a mile away at IHOP, the desk clerk said the driver could not go anywhere but the airport (something even their website refutes). Not the best area to be walking around at midnight. The next morning everybody had to wait outside while the van driver loaded luggage into the van - he wouldn't even open the door of the van. Oh, and the worst thing is that they don't answer the phone - whether you're in a room or calling for transportation - sometimes letting it ring 10-15 minutes, or until you give up in disgust. Like I said - What a Dump! Thanks, AA.

<Content>A Dump, Do Yourself A Favour Avoid At All Costs This hotel doesn't even deserve a one star rating. What a hole. The staff are rude which ads insult to injury. We stayed in this kip on the 30th Dec as we had an early enough flight and had to leave are car hire back and thought it would be convenient, never again would I stay here or advise anyone else to either. Use the Mariott across the road. There is no tea/coffee facilities in the rooms, it doesn't do room service, the key chain on our door was broken, we were in room 521, both lifts were broken when we stayed and had to use the service lift, after been told by a foreign guy who worked there that the stairs were a no go!!!!!!I was trying to contact the reception for an hour and the guy at reception kept picking up the phone and hanging up again, I made a complaint to him and he just shrugged his shoulders and said 'So' There was only two towels in the bathroom, and the room was filty. Music was blarring from some pub nearby until 1.30am, we got sod all sleep. I can safely say its the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and we tried to get another hotel to stay in when we were there, but unfortunately as it was the 30th Dec couldn't get any, we even considered sleeping in the car. Do yourselves a favour and stay somewhere else if at all possible, The Marriott or somewhere else, but don't put yourself through such horrors. You've been warned and you will be treated like dirt.

<Content>Disgusting Don't let the lobby fool you. As mentioned by other guests of this dump, the elevators not working properly is the first warning sign. But wait until you get into your room. Filthy carpet, and I mean filthy, horrible decor, rude staff members. The only reason I stayed was because the Airline paid for it, which is another issue I need to take up with them. If you are from some ghetto slum then you may feel at home here, otherwise, fork out a few more dollars for a clean hotel.

<Content>Ok For A Quick Stopover We rolled into this hotel at the end of a cruise which terminated in Port Miami. We used the hotel as a daybase. Our flight did not leave Miami until 8pm. We arrived at hotel at 10AM and only used it as a dayroom until our flight left.We chose the hotel because of its close proximity to the airport and reasonable cost.The room we had, 424 I believe, was ok. It was clean and the bathroom was clean as well. We had two double beds. Air-conditioning worked. We slept a few hours and then went to the pool, which I thought was pretty nice for that hotel. See pics on Travel Advisor.We called the front desk twice for extra towels due to our time at the pool. Looks like they just issue a few towels per room. Our requests were quickly answered by a knock on the door with a maid handing us more towels. The hotel has a free shuttle to the airport -- which we took advantage of. I think it also offers a shuttle to port, possibly with a charge for more than two persons. Check other reviews on that.The hotel also has a nice lobby and what looks like an expensive restaurant serving South American cuisine which we did not frequent. There is a sub shop across the street that is not bad, but double-check your order. They got ours all botched up. There is also a sit-down restaurant next-door, which we also did not try. The hotel is located on a busy street just a few miles from the airport. The planes do go over the hotel constantly, so if that would bother you, don't stay there.All in all, not a bad place to land for a few hours. It is by no means however, a Ritz-Carlton but ok for a quick stopover while waiting for a cruise or flight.

<Content>Horrible, Dirty and mildew February 16, 2006I have never experienced such filth and improper care for a room as I had in this hotel. Upon arriving I requested a non-smoking room.February 15th I arrived to a very nice looking lobby, however came into a room that had mildew in the walls and the bathrooms have a permanent stain on the tub and floor which looked as an oil stain and down right filth. In plain view cigarette burns through out the room and linens. I was on a very tight schedule and did not have the time to deal with a room change therefore all I did was to leave my luggage and go to my appointments for the day. Upon my return at around 9:00PM I could not stay in such a room all I kept on seeing all around me was the mildew and the dirt imbedded in the carpet, comforter and curtains etc. I called the front desk and requested a room change. This room change was done from room 411 to room 202. To my surprise the room was in a worst condition. This was a handicapped room again it was so late that I had to leave early the following morning I had to stay with no other choice. I asked is there another room cleaner than this. Room 202 has the similar items mildew in the walls and around the grout in addition it has cigarette burns on the comforter and in the carpets as well as the curtains. The handicapped equipment was in plain view not under any cover or in a proper storage area, the hand rail that was in the bathroom was very rusty and filth around the edges clearly not a clean room. Again I asked to be changed to a proper room. I was given room 616 this room looked as if it was not vacuumed with drywall dust all around the edges of the room in the carpet.I had enough and at 8:00PM on February 16, I left your hotel to another hotel that offered clean beds and clean rooms. I did not receive a clean room from all aspect and any standards. In speaking to the front desk personnel they stated that they have had this issue with unclean rooms in a consistent basis and many people complain to them so they are very much aware that this is a very serious situation that is not being adhered to by the ownership.

<Content>Airport Regency Hotel - Miami A friend and I stayed here for one night pre-cruise in January. They had a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel. You have to flag them down to stop for you. Check in was easy. We arrived early afternoon and were given a room even tho check in was not till later in the day. We wanted to relax by the pool, but that was roped off and not available. So we opted to find something to eat. Hotel restaurant was not open so we asked at the desk for some suggestions and they pointed us to a few places. Walked down the street to the Cuban Cafe. Prices were inexpensive, food pretty good. They also had a breakfast menu which was good because when we went to the hotel restaurant for breakfast the next morning, we found it to be very expensive. The room itself was ok. Two comfortable beds, tv - all the basics. The a/c unit was noisy during the night. My friend wanted to soak in the tub after a long day and found no plug - took shower instead. Hotel offered two trips to the cruise pier(complimentary)in the morning. All in all the hotel was ok; price was reasonable, room was clean, but I wouldn't make it my home base if I was staying longer than one or two nights.

<Content>Fine for an overnighter This is a decent hotel that has some age to it. I usually stay in Hampton Inns, Comfort Suites, that range for business so this is a little bigger than i'm used to - 6 floors total. I was definitely unimpressed with breakfast - even at free I'd go somewhere else - but there's a pool and a bar and a little gift shop. The pool is kind of small but goes to 5 or 6 feet, it's quaint. I didn't see anyone at the bar but it was Wed. night. There's a seafood restaraunt within walkind distance, but I didn't eat there. The room itself was standard fare although definitely had age. It looks like the hotel was bought by another company or someone is really putting an effort to turn it around, though, because everything was very clean and well kept.

<Content>Warning *** Avoid this hotel if you are smart Terrible experience, no other way to describe it. Lobby looks OK, but it is a facade fooling the unsuspecting visitor. The rest is extremely dated, dirty and has many facilities that don't work. The bathroom is simply yuk and old. The advertised wireless internet is not free ($15 for 24 hours) something I look for as a business traveler. After I paid, I then found out the service doesn't work and I ended up walking to the hotel next door and sitting in their lobby using their free service which worked flawlessly at high speed.The staff is totally uninterested almost to the point of being rude. The free breakfast only covers coffee and some sad looking pastries. The additional price for a cooked breakfast was only $4.96 but after scrutinizing the bill, that fee turned out to be a gratuity! For staff that huddled together at the desk chatting. I had to plead for coffee and I had to move my dirty plates myself to make room for reading the paper.Even the remote control for the TV didn't work. All in all a hotel that has lost it. I will NEVER stay here again and I advise anyone who has just the basic needs in a hotel to stay away - you will be disappointed.

<Content>Filthist room I've every been in. Room 301 at the Airport Regency in Miami. Thanks to American Airline we missed our flight to connect to Memphis. The airline said they would help us out by getting us a room for the night and then catch a flight the next day. The shuttle was fine, the lobby was beautifull with leather seating. Then when we got to the room, the carpet was so dirty I would not let a dog sleep on it. There was no lock on the bathroom door, the sink faucet had toothpaste spit all over it and the tub had brown rings of filth and not one wash cloth. I tried to reach the main deck about changing rooms and they never answered the phone. I tried three different times and the phone rang at least 15-20 time is try. I have taken pictures and will be sending them to the Florida Health Department.
