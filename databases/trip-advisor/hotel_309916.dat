<Content>Never stay here I walked in to book this hotel and they patently ripped me off. Price wise it was 150 Singapore dollars for 8 hours since I arrived at midnight. The room was DISGUSTING, mouldy, filthy, damp, old, no hot water and airconditioner noise. I had to double the dose of antihistamines and sleep in my clothes the beds were that unhygenic. Yuk yuk yuk..... not even budget. Do not ever stay here

<Content>Very average Other posters have really said it all.No window, poor lighting, small room, dusty walls, old stained carpet in the hall and room, no shower curtain, no room safe.However I am a budget traveler. So it was fairly cheap for Singapore where land is of course expensive, so the room will be small.On the plus side. Location is good. Right next to chinatown which has its own metro station plus tons of places to eat. It is perfectly walkable to the old colonial district if you feel like it.The bed was clean and comfortable and the aircon worked. All in all the hotel just felt its age (old) so just don't expect very much.

<Content>Don't be fooled by this hotel's website The Royal Peacock Hotel promotes itself as a boutique hotel with a three-star rating, but the facilities and cleanliness do not come close to what they claim. Our room was dark and dingy, with peeling, burned ceilings and scuffed carpets. The walls felt like they were paper-thin since we could hear each heavy step, banging doors and loud noise. The bathroom was small, with no space for a tub, having instead a tiny shower area with unfinished tiling. The rooms are in a state of disrepair and are in need of a major renovation. The reception staff are unfriendly and do not offer any voluntary assistance. When we wanted to leave our luggage with the concierge, the guy just gave as a rope and tag and left it to us to squeeze our luggage into this small room at the back of the reception area (filled with other bags). The only redeeming factor was the good condition of the bfast nook and the friendly cook and waitress. Even for the low rate of SG$135 a night, this hotel was totally not worth it.

<Content>Awful, awful Worst couple hundred dollars ever spent on a hotel. The standard room I got was dark (no windows granted but the lighting was not enough to compensate), the shelves were dusty, the bathroom towel rail was falling off and the beddings looked so worn and shabby. Ditto the hallway carpet. Awkward room layout meant the desk was squashed up next to the TV. Aircon worked OK.

<Content>Worst hotel ever The room was AWFUL: no windows, poor lighting, extremely cramped, poor bedding. The door to the bathroom was more of a screen. Bathroom was extremely basic. Do not stay in this hotel under any circumstances.

<Content>Royal Peacock lost it's Feathers We have just returned from a trip to Thailand and Singapore. The Royal Peacock hotel in Singapore was disappointing to say the least. We booked the executive suite as we thought we would treat ourselves for 3 days in Singapore. The most disappointing thing was the price - nearly S$250 per night is absolutely outrageous for the poor quality of this hotel. To begin, there is no-one to take your bags and show you to your room, which I wouldn't mind if staying at a back packers or a budget hotel! We arrived at our room to find a queen bed with grubby pillowcases (clean, but permanently stained) and no blankets in sight - only a sheet and thin bedspread. We soon understood why as the aircon barely worked. We had two windows with wooden shutters, only when I went to open them, found that they opened onto views of large airconditioning fans, which seemed to be working - just not in our room! There was no minibar - only an empty fridge that was barely cold. When we went to bed at night, all we could hear and feel through the bed was the rumbling fans from outside our windows. The carpets were grubby, the room and bathroom smelled - not just the standard 'humid climate musty hotel room smell' either... the shower was barely warm and there was no hot water from the hand basin at all. No hand towels or face washer provided, only 2 threadbare bath towels and a bath mat. I've stayed in back packers better than this hotel for less than half the price. Extremely disappointing and would not stay here again.

<Content>Nothing wrong with the Royal Peacock After reading many negative review on TripAdvisor, I nearly didn't book at the Royal Peacock - but price, timing and location dictated that it was my best choice. Admittedly, the rooms were small - perhaps I wasn't so bothered by this as I'd prepared myself from the multiple reviews that had mentioned this? Or perhaps I wasn't bothered because I wasn't in Singapore to spend hours dancing around in a spacious hotel room? Anyway, they certainly jam everything in, but if you're just there to sleep or regroup, it's not problem. The facilities were fine - comfy bed, tidy bathrooms, operational fridge, air conditioning etc. A little strange how they only provided one cup and glass for a double room though... I found the service to be excellent. Staff were very helpful in letting us store our luggage as well as ensuring our valuables were stored in a safe place, booking us a taxi and helping us with local advice and directions. Oh, and the breakfast was plentiful. Given the great location (easy walk into China town's market areas, shops or to public transport), comfort and price of the place, I thought the Royal Peacock hotel was great value. I would stay there again.

<Content>compare to The Inn At Temple St? This is heaven After much heated argument @The Inn in March, we managed to book this one in Chinatown district on our way back fr Aus. It's convenient-Outram Park MRT is just a stone throw, lots of food and shops till you drop, no more after 11pm'' [--] (pls read our review of The Inn At Temple Street) like what we encountered @The Inn, helpful, friendly and smiling staff, free internet access, (imagine you gotta to pay S$7 @The Inn), great location and good food. Room is small but OK and clean, at least AC is working specially in the hot day like this. Will definitely introduce this hotel to friends. Keep up the good work, peacock!!!

<Content>Was NOT satisfied with room When we arrived after a long tiring bus ride from Kuala Lumpur, there was no valet to bring our luggage in. After 2 trips back and forth from the taxis we finally managed to get all the luggage in with the admin, as well as 3 employees standing around doing nothing and watching us suffer. To make things worst, whilst pulling our luggage to our room, the corridor had 3 steps every 30metres or so, pulling luggage over steps is also quite annoying! The room was not too small but felt very damp for some reason. Our room had a fire exit door which CANNOT be locked. The warning sign on the door stated that the alarm will sound when opened. However, when we tested it, there was no alarm, the only response was our shock horror at the rubbish and rusting staircase just a few steps behind that door. This door affected our stay as it was just 3 girls in a hotel room that has a fire exit which can't be locked? safety issues! The bedsheets and pillows had a musky smell, one of the pillows even had a yellow stain on one of the corners. The bathroom was clean, but the shower head wasn't strong and was the type of shower head attached to a plastic box where you have to turn the knob to the temperature that you wanted. There was also ants all over the bathroom, must be from the rubbish dump of a backyard/fire exit that the hotel has. The bathroom window was also not lockable but they were quite small so it was not really a safety threat, just a peeping tom threat. We got free breakfast, we arrived at 9.45am, the buffet breakfast finishes at 10.30am but most of the food was finished and was not refilled. They also started rushing us by asking if we were done with a section so they can clean up. This was annoying as it made us feel rushed. Checking in and out was fast which is good and the bed was quite comfortable. So as you can tell by this post, me and my friends were extremely unsatisfied and felt very unsafe whilst staying in the hotel room that we received. For the price that we paid (around $230 AUD a night) we expected a much better room. So reconsider and search around for alternative hotels before booking this one because at this room rate, ++ a few dollars you can surely find a more comfortable stay.

<Content>Great Location, Room's OK If you are looking for convenience to the MRT (subway), food and shopping (Chinatown) then this hotel is ideal. There are tons of local eateries to choose from, all within walking distance. Coffee shop across the hotel has excellent coffee at less than $1. The room is not what I would expect for the $100/night. The double has a pretty comfy Queen sleigh bed, but the TV console unit was placed at a very awkard angle so that to reach the other side of the bed, you had better be real skinny! A small desk and chair, and one bedside table, a large armoire with mirrors complete the room furnishings. Bathroom was tiny, sitting on the toilet you will almost bang your knees against the wall. Shower stall was ok, small, water was warm with low pressure. Lighting in the room was minimal: bedside lamps and another over the desk. Definitely not for reading. Plus points is that the entire room was immaculate and spotlessly clean. The room was facing away from the street so it was quiet. Breakfast was tolerably, warm but limited, supply runs out early. Staff was helpful and courteous. I doubt I will return to this hotel as there are better choices that are cheaper.

<Content>Dirty Smelly Rooms It looked so charming on the internet photos but the photos are nothing compared to reality.Don't ever stay in this hotel unless its the last room in Singapore!My room had a window but when you opened it you faced the exhause of the aircon motor.The carpets were dirty  tattered.The hot water did not work.The room smelled terribly.The manager tried to rip me off .I asked him where I could find a money changer,He tried to convience me to change my A$ with him at a 1 to 1 with the S$,when I refused he told me there were no money changers in the area.I found 7 in peoples park 1 street behind for a rate of 1 to $1.28 a difference of 28%!!! For a few dollars more you could do much better!

<Content>China Town Location I got a walk up rate to this Hotel in a rather full house Singapore. I liked the location as there are not that many hotels in China Town at a reasonable cost. The rooms are clean enough but not perfect. Small rooms / reasonable value considering cost of posh hotels in Singapore tend to be growing higher of late. I would stay here again due to cost and location but I would probably ask to inspect the room in advance. This hotel should be considered in the budget range, Other Hotels of similar price or quality tend not to have such a central location.

<Content>Only Stayed 5 Minutes Booked a deluxe triple room here, but when we arrived discovered that means a tiny room with two single beds and another folded trundle bed that had not been assembled. Little wonder why -- there was no place to put it except right up against the bathroom or the entrance door. Wonder how they manage with fire regulations? Also wonder what their normal triple rooms are like, if this was deluxe!We had brought our car, but there was only on-street parking which is very expensive and charged by the half hour.The room had a window, but it smelled of mildew. After five minutes of sitting on the bed, wondering if the peacock-coloured walls were worth it, we decided to try elsewhere. And the front desk staff didn't seem very interested in dissuading us.

<Content>Nothing exceptional, but correct The rooms do not fit the charming design of the lobby, but are quite good value and great location for Singapore. Be aware that the standard rooms are without window. Aside of claustrophobia, it is not always with a pleasant smell. We booked one of them via the hotel website at a discount price. After the first night and some complains (we did require a room with window in our booking), they moved us to a room with window, an upgrade at no extra cost 鈥?very much appreciated. Staff friendly. Room small but there is worse in Sing, clean, with tea/coffee facilities and a slightly cool fridge. Breakfast included, nothing exceptional, but correct.

<Content>not the best but not bad for price We stayed at this hotel for 10 days in Sept 06,As we had looked at the reviews also we were a little bit worried but as we were meeting someone else there we decided to go ahead.Its not the best hotel around but it does the job considering we only wanted somewhere to sleep really.The room wasnt to bad,we had worse when we went to London,and it was kept clean by the staff who where great, the restaurant was brilliant and cheap.

<Content>Good value for cheap hotel Came from Indonesia and going to stay on this hotel for 20 days. (This review I wrote when I has been stay for 10 days.) Before arrive I had read all the review about this hotel, made me quite afraid what experience may I face. Got a room, single bed, windowed, facing to back of the hotel. After a night passed, well, the hotel is not bad at all. Connected to free internet help me alot for my job. The first day I met a receptionist who can speak Indonesia !Got problem with prepaid phone card, (which my friend back home can not sms me) the hotel receptionist was kindly help me to find what the problem.The room itself is clean, with all the facilities and services worth much more than the rate.Located just 5 minutes - relax walking to Outram Park MRT station, which where 2 routes of MRT transfering point.For long stay with minimum budget, I would like to give high recommendation to this hotel.

<Content>Avoid this place Quite run downed place which no character. Lobby and restaurant seem to be styled on the first sight but the rest is ancient.The Rooms are quite small and with no style.We were lucky and got a small window in the room with a lookout to some technical equipment. Noisy air conditioners and dirty carpets limit the joy of staying in the room.Got up early on our last day to catch a early bus but the breakfast did not start in time. The breakfast selection and service was very limited. The bread was mildewed.Reception stuff was unhelpful and rude, no greeting or thank. A request for some ice cubs were answered with the address of the next Seven Eleven.

<Content>Not bad We stayed here for one night as part of a tour, we didnt have a window in our room but were pleased with the cleaniliness of the room and ensuite bathroom. The lobby was very modern and comfortable and the room had a very effective and quiet air conditioner. We are backpacking and would not have booked somewhere like this, it was fairly straightforward accomodation with few frills, looking at the prices for a double room I am not convinced you get good value for money, but Singapore is expensive!Two criticisms, there weren't enough lights in the room which without a window is a must. Also, the shower was slightly broken in that there was no where to attach the shower head so we were forced to shower as though using a hose! I'm sure this could easily have been rectified but our one night stop meant it wasn't worth complaining.

<Content>Going against the tide here but.... I stayed at this hotel for one night recently and quite enjoyed it. Whilst it has flaws (the decor is a little tired and it's in a loud area), I would stay here again if in Singapore. I found the receptionstaff to be friendly, the rooms clean and adequate (yes they are on the small side but I guess I'm more interested in spending time out and about in Singapore rather than lazing around in a room), the breakfast was fine, the rooms had all the amenities needed eg. TV, hair dryer, bottled water, air con, safe. It was located on a great road in a historical area near the MRT. Can't speak for others but my personal experience was a pleasant one.

<Content>Very Friendly Budget Hotel. We (my mum and I )stayed at the Royal Peacock as part of an Intrepid tour and I had read reviews on trip advisor before we left, so I really wasn't looking forward to it. We landed in Singapore very early and so got to the hotel around 8am (check in wasn't until 2pm). We were greeted by a very friendly gentleman at the reception desk who told us he would try his very best to get at least one room for us to share asap. He offered us complimentary breakfast which we thought was very nice. A room was ready within the hour. The rooms are very very small and cramped. The bathroom is small and not flashy but everything worked okay and it was 'fairly' clean. We eventually got another room (we stayed in one room each, with a single bed, TV, window, small desk and robe. Each room had it's own bathroom). My airconditioner wasn't as effective as the one in my mums room. The noise from the street was quite loud at night but take ear-plugs with you and it will be fine. Breakfast was nice. I think if you don't expect too much this hotel is fine for a very short stay. Other rooms in the hotel may be worse than the ones we had but after reading all of the bad reviews I didn't think it was too bad. If I had a choice I would probably stay somewhere better, but as part of a tour it's okay.

<Content>Absolute Hell Hole Having read reviews on tripadvisor I was not looking forward to staying here, but as it was the hotel my tour group was using, I had little choice. Retrospectively, I would have stayed elsewhere and sacrificed the money paid to cover my stay here. I moved rooms once (much to the annoyance of the receptionist) because the first room was extremely noisy from an outdoor air-conditioning unit. The second room had exactly the same problem and I was told that they had no others. I didn't sleep at all the entire night - although the air-conditioning unit was outside, the walls were so thin that they may as well have not been there. Incidentally, these were 'deluxe' rooms on the second floor, not the cheapest rooms. The bathroom was so disgusting and mouldy that I actually went out and bought cleaning products before I felt able to take a shower - and even then I was in and out as fast as possible! This hotel has an extremely professional website which simply does not reflect reality. Especially in clean, comfortable Singapore, where there is an abundance of good hotels at reasonable prices, I cannot see why anyone would want to stay here and would advise people to stay well away. It was the WORST hotel I have ever had the misfortune to stay in.

<Content>Give this one a miss I walked past Royal Peacock 3 years ago and kept the name card because it looked such a funky place in the heart of Chinatown, a really vibrant area. Finally, I got my chance and stayed there. Not again. Passing the great lobby I went into the sad, shabby, 'pre-loved' lift and thought Oh No...I couldnt cope with the miniscule room with no windows making it really claustrophic. There was no coat hangers and no bottled water which I thought was really stingy. A fire alarm went off at 5am for about 20 mins - from then on I just counted down the hours until I escaped....

<Content>Not Recommended I stayed for 4 nights and did not enjoy my stay at all. Admittedly, I'd opted for the cheapest room type (attic, no window) but found the room to be extremely small and noisy due to the bed being right up against the paper-thin corridor wall. This was compounded by other guests running up and down the corridor at all hours with creaking floorboards, slamming doors - all made worse when you're lying in the bed which is butted right up to the wall. Bathroom was also very tiny and barely big enough to move around in.The only positive things to say is the reception and ground floor public areas which has nice rustic charm.Overall, unless you're on a very tight budget, I would steer clear.

<Content>Yuck. Everything we heard about this hotel is true. Looks lovely from the outside and the reception is very well decorated too.Our room was on the 3rd floor and had no window (we expected this anyway). The only lightin came from 2 lamps. 3 other lights did not work and despite us complaining about the fact we could barely see, nothing was done.Bathroom was horrible. As we had travelled through Malaysia we expected the shower on the floor deal, but the shower here wasnt even on a holder and it sprayed out about 5 different directions so everything got wet except us.

<Content>Only thing Royal are the colours The only royal reflected in this hotel are the colours.I had to change my room four times before I found a room with a proper curtain to keep the light out. All the bathrooms smelled of sewage. There was mould on the shower tiles. The hotel is located on a busy, noisy streeet, ESPECIALLY at night. You will not get much sleep here even with earplugs. Their website boasts that this hotel is a jewel and pride. I think they should change the words to a stone's remorse in Chinatown.

<Content>Mixed The decor was simple with beautiful, deep colours and some nice antiques. It had a very 'rustic' feel but unfortunately, the room was too small and the shower was delapidated and although it was cleaned there was still some mildew. The sheets were clean however the decorative pillows at the foot of the bed weren't! I'd left a cookie on the night table for an hour or so, then to my surprise noticed a very long trail of ants!! My friend pointed out that the ants were also in the bathroom! The breakfast buffet was satisfactory and the front desk clerk was friendly and helpful. I wouldn't stay there again, though.

<Content>Needs some major overhaul I booked the hotel before I read TripAdvisor's reviews. What a mistake. The pictures on the website looked good and cosy, however, this is not the case when I booked in. Nice lobby reception area, however, the lift + room was a disaster. We had the superior double room which was more expensive, but later I realise the standard room is around the same, and the only difference is that we have a window. It did not help in any way though, the room we got was near the main road and extremely noisy.Here are the problems with our room:- 2 small holes in the quilt cover- Ceiling of the entrance to the toilet had a leak, which dripped at times to the carpet- Stained carpet- 21鈥?TV with no tuning capabilities and only 3 channels available (Ch 5, 8  CNA)- Windows which belonged to the samsui days are great, but not soundproof enough to muffle the rumbling traffic- Fridge which barely managed to keep my wine chilled- Light switches which are not user friendly- Bad leaking between the shower hose and shower head, which spilled over the tiled floor at a corner, leading to mouldy spots. Black mouldy spots- Faulty shower head. And the water squirts everywhere to wet the wrong places when least needed- Aircon which emits whirring sounds (especially if you鈥檙e a fan of 25 deg C and below)I will not stay there again, unfortunately.

<Content>Do not stay here! The Hotel is located in what was the Red Light Distrcit and certianly does not live up to its name! My room was extremley small, the shower leaked, I could not get towels (and when they did arrive they were frayed and dirty) Lights were not working and I had to replace bulbs my self. Getting taxis to come to the Hotel in peak times is impossible - so get to know the MRT timetable or the bus'es. While the kitchen staff were extre,ely polite and helpful, this could not be said for the rest of the crew! Do not stay here!

<Content>Nightmare at Royal Peacock Hotel Singapore Horrible hotel, no window in the room I booked into for 5 days, the staff was perturbed that I wanted a room with a window! finally got it. Staff needs to be called several times for a wakeup call or before they send you an ironing table. Very rude and ill behaved staff. Absolutely filthy bathrooms with broken telephone shower. Gloomy rooms with no natural lighting at all. The whole place stinks (china town)..DO NOT EVER STAY AT THE ROYAL PEACOCK HOTEL.

<Content>caveat emptor - buyer beware I strongly recommend NOT using the Royal Peacock Hotel.On check-in, we were treated extremely poorly.Although I contacted the management who have admitted that the check-in service we received was poor, they certainly aren't interested in doing anything about it. The requests for service had to be made repeatedly for them to be fulfilled. And we waited long periods of time before repeating our requests. I can only say if you stay here, don't expect great service and 'caveat emptor' - 'buyer beware'!

<Content>Nice Lobby, shame about the room!! Well I've just come back from a stay at this hotel. I stayed in a double room (with my husband) and to say it was a small room is an understatement. The double bed was pushed up against the wall so it meant that my husband had to climb across me if he wanted to get out of bed. Also the lighting is very bad and the room very dark, but not quite dark enough to notice that the room could do with a very good clean, quite dusty and grimy in places!!For an airconditioned room, the air conditioner didn't work very well at all.The bathroom is a whole other story. Whilst it is large enough, there was mould growing on nearly every surface, especially the ceiling. The ceiling also was falling down in places. In fact when I sat on the toilet water from the room above dripped onto me. I can only hope that it wasn't from the toilet above.The hotel staff come across as being bored and uncaring. Some of them even give you wrong information on where you want to go.The only redeeming features of this hotel are the breakfasts and its location.Personally if I were to stay here again I wouldn't waste my money on a double room, instead I would ask for a delux room at the back of the building as the rooms at the front are quite noisy at night.

<Content>OK for a night, but not extended stay Stayed in the attic room one night. These rooms dont have windows. It was supposed to be non-smoking but there it was smokey. It is supposed to be renovated but the carpet had definitely seen better days and looked quite grimey. Paint was also peeling and the furniture is dated. On the plus side, bed was big and very comfortable, there was storage space, and the hotel is quite atmospheric (or dark, depending how you see it). Great location and breakfast was quite good.If I stayed there again, it would have to be in a windowed room.
