<Content>Favorite hotel in Italy This was by far our favorite hotel in Italy. It is a gorgeous hotel right on the Grand Canal and a stone's throw from the Rialto Bridge. I cannot imagine staying anywhere else in Venice. For what you pay (very reasonable), I can't imagine getting a better hotel. Owner/operator Matteo was so gracious and friendly and sincerely interested in us having a good time. I swear I think he would cry if we weren't happy.The room was huge, ornate, and beautiful. The view out of our window was of the Rialto Bridge. The location was ideal. One of the best things about it is the breakfast. After 6 days of Italian breakfasts, we were so happy to be offered eggs and sausage. You can take the guy out of America...This was definitely our favorite hotel in Italy and we can't wait to go back again.

<Content>simply wonderful There are no words to describe the charme of the place and the peerless position of the hotel: the pictures made by other travellers speak by themselves.So, just few words that can resume the heart of this wonderful place: this is the way each Hotel in the world shuold have to be managed. The kindness of the owner Matteo and of all the staff is beyond any expectation. They put their heart, mind and soul in their work...and this is evidenced in every little particular, from the welcome to the breakfast, from the furnitures to the cleaniness, from the answer to any information request to the service... everything is pervaded by the love for the work and the place. And believe me, unfortunately in Venice this is not so common...

<Content>Just Fabulous! Having visited Venice several times in the past, I was amazed to find a hotel of this quality and level of guest service at this price. The owner, Matteo, greeted me upon arrival by name. Our room was not only clean, which is an imperative, but also gorgeous. No lodging in Venice proper is inexpensive, but even compared to the Bauer Il Palazzo (where I stayed on my honeymoon) and the Hotel Danieli, the Al Ponte Antico is just beautiful, in a perfect location, and the level of staff attention and graciousness is simply beyond compare (for a third of the price). Matteo and his staff, particularly Oliver, made us feel like royalty. I highly recommend the Al Ponte Antico.

<Content>Wonderful place Everything about the hotel is excellent - it may not have the facilities of a 5 star hotel but the customer service (Matteo, Oliviero, Rosalba et al) is better than any 5 star hotel we have ever stayed in.Would re-iterate everyone else's comments - if you visit Venice, you must stay here - it makes the trip that little bit more special.Restaurants - Antico Dolo (ask Matteo for directions) was superb, El Corte was also very good for Pizza and prices reasonable.....wasn't impressed at all with Aqua pazza - very expensive, food average at best and service not even close to that delivered by the Antico Dolo staff.Transport - floods prevented us getting the Airport water bus to Rialto, so we took the water bus to St Mark's square instead - took over 1.5hrs, very slow, crowded and would not recommend it. For the journey home, we walked to the Piazzale Roma (bus station) - 20mins and caught the bus to the airport - 鈧? each, lots of space and 20 mins later we were right outside the arrivals hall. Enjoy your visit to Venice, make sure you try the 'local trendy drink' - Spritz but go with Aperol instead of Campari.

<Content>So friendly We followed others' advice and would reinforce all the positive comments. Matteo is a superb host and very knowledgeable about the City and where to eat and where to find the best wines. The location is perfect, far enough away from St Mark's to avoid the worst of the tourists, but easy walking to all main attractions.

<Content>The most incredible hotel experience. If you experience one hotel stay in your lifetime it should be the Al Ponte Antico Hotel. The overall beauty and warmth of the hotel is only surpassed by the wonderful people who make your stay unforgettable. Upon arrival Oliviero welcomed us as if we were family. After showing us around this magnificent property we were made to feel as if we were truly royalty!!! My husband and I were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and upon entering our beautifully decorated hotel room we found a silver tray with champagne. But the best is yet to come. We were fortunate enough to meet Matteo, the owner, who we had heard so much about. He is one of the most charming people you could ever have the privlege of meeting. Matteo, the rest of the hospitality industry should come to Al Ponte Anico for a lesson from you. Breakfast, where do i start... Matteo makes your omelettes to order with fresh eggs from his family's farm. If you prefer crepes there are none better. Rosalba was always there to fulfill any need you may have. Croissants, cereals, juices, yogurts, fruit, coffee, hot chocolate, etc. I could go on and on but the only way to understand is to visit. We dined on a terrace overlooking the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge, what could be better. Venice is beautiful but without Al Ponte Antico we would not have had the same experience. Thank you Matteo, Oliviero and Rosalba for the most unforgettable 30th anniversary one could wish for. Caren and Stan

<Content>Can I say incredible?!?!?!?! The staff was incredible! They knew us by name at check-in, they offered recommendations for dinner and entertainment that were unbelievable. The breakfast each morning was to die for! Fresh homemade omelets, fresh fruit, sausage, bacon and crepes. We were so spoiled I cannot begin to tell you how soon I would like to return!

<Content>Wonderful Place! We stayed at the Hotel Al Ponte Antico for 2 nights at the begininng of October prior to a cruise. We had a junior suite on the first floor. The room was huge with a magnificent view of the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge. In the afternoon we would open the large windows and sit watching the Venetian world go by. Matteo and his staff treat you as if you are family from the instant you arrive. Everyone is on a first name basis and every detail is thought of. The location is convenient to everyplace in Venice. Everything that has been said by other reviewers about breakfast on the terrace being wonderful is absolutely true. We have already booked the same room for our visit to Venice next year! I can't think of a better recommendation than that.

<Content>Perfect to propose! This place is fantastic. I was originally booked into another hotel in Venice but due to flood repairs they called to cancel us and I was very dissapointed. This was a suprise holiday for my then girlfriend, it was her birthday and she had always wanted to go to Italy. So right up to the day it was a suprise where we were going.The hotel was so magical, so much so that before we had even checked our bags in I took her out to the balcony and proposed to her (I had planned on doing it at some stage during our 3 days there but the view from the balcony was perfect!) she said yes and we were married 2 and a half weeks ago.We hope to come back for one of our anniversaries. The staff were lovely and the room - just at the top of the stairs to the right as you walk towards the balcony - was perfect!I can highly reccomend this place and it will always hold a special place in our hearts.

<Content>absolutely fantastic While the hotel does have a fantastic location, beautiful interior, and wonderful style - its greatest assets are Matteo and his staff. They give you the hospitality one would expect was only received by royalty - and they are truly so helpful in everything. As the hotel only has 9 rooms, you will never get lost in the crowd and the small things like Matteo using your first name, and his great drinks and food served on the terrace truly make this place exceptional. This hotel desreves the number 1 spot here.

<Content>Fantastic experience We had 1 night at the Al Ponte Antico, and the only complaint was that it was not long enough.Even though the weather was terrible, it did not spoil our time in Venice.The room we had was huge for Venice (or Europe for that matter).Mattheo  staff were warm  welcoming.The recommedation for dinner was also very good, and we recommended it to some friends as well. The best Sea Bass ever, according to my husband.The coffee at Al Pnte was excellent-it took 3 weeks before I found another decent cup!Location cannot be faulted.Just can't wait to go back!

<Content>Spritzers, Moonlight and Warmth Taking your wife to one of the most romantic destinations in the world may be the norm, taking your mother and your wife is probably not. But, off the three of us went to beautiful Venice. As a surprise we took the motor taxi to the hotel, very James Bond, but my mother both shaken and stirred by the somewhat bumpy trip was very happy to see the hotel, but not so happy about getting from boat to land. Never a fear, with a toot of the horn, we were met not by one but three attendants who all but carried the septuagenarian from the boat. And then there was Matteo, with movie star looks and a perfect smile, he took charge immediately, and the worries of trying to keep everyone happy just drifted away. Do yourself a favour, don't hesitate, stay here. There are so many good things I could say, but in short, it is a gem, it is beautiful, it is ornate and well posh without being stuffy, it is intimate and charming and the care and attention that Matteo, Oliver, Thomas, and all the others paid to us and particularly the attention that Matteo gave to my mother made the trip truly something special. We had memorable evenings spent drinking spritzers in the moonlight looking at the Rialto Bridge with good company provided by the other guests and our evening host Oliver, it was truly magic. Breakfasts were wonderful too, with the speciality eggs any way you want, and views of the comings and goings on the Grand Canal, Venice's main street. So as it must, the end of our trip arrived, back onto the motor taxi but this time the now very relaxed and very happy Grand Dame was quite looking forward to the experience, especially as she was to be waved off by Matteo, who without his knowing had come quite close to being adopted. Thanks to everyone at the hotel and especially Matteo and Oliver for their kindness, warmth and care. We will be back.

<Content>Make you feel like royalty! We cannot rave about this hotel enough, but as gorgeous as the palace, rooms, and views are...it is the staff that really makes it the best hotel in Venice and one of the best in the world! Everyone knows you and calls you by name, and they take genuine pleasure in catering to your every desire and more. We truly felt like royalty! Matteo and Oliver were absolutely fabulous, and they gave us wonderful recommendations for native restaurants and sites. We felt like old friends within minutes of meeting them, and we so enjoyed talking to them. The same family also owns the Locanda Orseolo in Venice, which has equally fabulous service...just slightly more moderate accomodations (and prices), and the location is near St. Mark's vs. on the Grand Canal. If the Al Ponte Antico is full, stay at the Locanda Orseolo! We will not stay anywhere else in Venice and can hardly wait to go back. Of all the cities in Europe we've visited, Venice was our favorite...and this was largely due to the experience of our wonderful hosts/hostesses at our hotel!

<Content>Your second home I stayed in Al Ponte Antico from 20.08.08 to 24.08.08. I can easily say it was a wonderful experience. I always try hard finding good accomodation and my priority is 'a special atmosphere' if not too overpriced. Thanks to many reviews of this site and my own research, Al Ponte Antico was probably the best possible choice. Hotel's website give a good idea of what can be expected: Smallauthentique hotel which you fall in love at first sight. As for the price, not too much for Venetian accomodation standards around Grand Canal. After my wonderful experince in Prague (Alchymist Grand Hotel and Spa), I was afraid of being disappointed in Venice and Al Ponte Antico. Thanks god, it was far from being the case: Both the city and the hotel fullfilled all my expectations.As those who already visited know, Venice is a very interesting city from the moment you land. You have to reach your hotel via sea route. It took around 30-40 minutes with a not-too-crowded seabus of Alilaguna Lines (which you can immediately buy tickets for 12鈧?at the airport). A faster option is watertaxi which I find too expensive (100鈧?. You land on Rialto stop, 5 minutes walk to Al Ponte Antico. When arriving, pay attention and spot the hotel, as when you land it's extremely easy to get lost in Venice, you'll find it difficult to find the place. Al Ponte Antico is at the end of a small street. Greeting at Al Ponte Antico was very nice and warm, which I liked much. Whether Armando, Oliviero, Tommaso or David are in the reception doesn't change things much as all of them are kind, friendly and warm-hearted. They do everything for you to feel at home and they succeed. Specially Oliviero (bornraisen in Venice, as he says) helped me and my girlfriend about the city and interesting places everytime we saw him. And when talking about people in Al Ponte Antico, how can one forget Matteo, the owner of this magnificient place? Probably the most kind, hard working and down to earth hotel-running-guy I ever met. He always ask about your plans for the day, make small recommendations, try to help you about the city and at the evening and finally not forgetting what you told him, asks you about your view on places you were. Not to even mention omelettes he makes himself, with eggs from his grandmothers village...After so much praise for the staff, the reader probably wonder about the room. The room I stayed was a small one, not having a view of Grand Canal but it was very nicely decorated, just like a bedroom in a private mansion. The bathroom is as big as the room itself, with very nice hydro-massage present.And finally the main 'trick' of Al Ponte Antico, the terrace in which you can have your breakfast. It have probaby the best of views for the Grand Canal. A very delicious open-buffet breakfast (thanks to Rosalba for excellent service and fantastic coffee) accompanied with Matteo's yummy omelettes and the dreamy view of the canal is worth every penny you spend even without further beauties of Venice! Shame there isn't dinner at the hotel but you can enjoy the terrace every hour of the daynight. It's a place you will like to spend time in.To sum up, if you look for hotels with high-end facilities, look elsewhere. But if you seek warm approach, family like treatment, special atmosphere, exclusiveoriginal accomodation and a small exclusive place like those in tales, books and films, Al Ponte Antico is the place. When your holiday ends, you won't only have unforgettable memories, but also new friends!

<Content>Excellent hotel We recently returned from a 2 week vacation in Italy. We spent 3 nights in Venice and stayed at the Al Ponte Antico Hotel. This hotel had received good reviews in the forums and I would like to provide another.We liked the location of this hotel and thought it optimal for staying in Venice. The hotel is on the Grand Canal near the Rialto Bridge. I had read some forums recommending staying off the Grand Canal due to noise. However, I think the positive aspects of staying on the Grand Canal outweigh any negative. Our room had windows opening onto the canal and there was some noise from the water traffic, but this is nothing like that of a motor highway. The room was insulated enough from noise at night and we were willing to put up with a little noise to be able to look out onto the Grand Canal whenever we wanted. Being on the Grand Canal also allows for direct transfers to and from the hotel by water taxi and eliminates lugging bags through the streets. The Hotel has a great view of the Rialto Bridge, but is a far enough walk away from the bridge, which is one of the more crowded areas in Venice. The central location allows easy access to all parts of the city either on foot or waterway.Our room was large and comfortable for 2 adults and 2 teenagers. The bathroom was small but nice. The room was air conditioned which was a blessing as it was hot and humid for much of the time we were in Venice.The best thing about this Hotel is the service. The owner Matteo is extremely helpful and friendly. He has trained all of the staff to be the same way. All of the staff speak English if that is a concern.We would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again if (or should I say when) we return to Venice.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Magical View Can't stop talking about our two night stay 19 Aug to 21 Aug in Venice. Matteo the hotel owner and all his staff were so welcoming and friendly, always available to give us directions and telling us where to eat. Our room was beautiful with a view to die for, and the terrace with the view of the Rialto Bridge, just watching the world go by whilst having breakfast was an experience not to be missed. After a day of sightseeing and walking it was perfect just to come back to the hotel and sit on the terrace. Would highly recommend this hotel as it has everything on a wish list.

<Content>Absolutely Amazing!.............. Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said before about this beautifull little gem of a hotel. My husband and I stayed there for three nights 16 - 19th August 2008, having read all the reviews I was hoping they were all going to be right, they were, - I don't think there are words to describe how wonderfull this hotel and of course 'Matteo' is. He is so passionate about the hotel (No Wonder!) and the city of Venice it is unbelievable. He wants you to truly enjoy and get the most out of your stay, both he and Oliver guided us constantly on the little map they gave us, as to where to go, the best times of day to visit places, and places to eat, even booking us into a restaurant on our first night, which was lovely (San Marco).Our room was beautifull, overlooking the Grand Canal, and just a few steps from the wonderfull terrace, where we spent many hours enjoying our 'Spritz' (delicious) and enjoying the fabulous view, all the people going by on the water buses look up at you , looking like they wish they were sat up there with you! We ended all our evenings on the terrace, where candles are lit all around, making it so romantic and special, to be honest we used to get back there at night and wonder why we ever went out in the first place!! It has to be the best spot in Venice. Matteo's omlettes are delicious, again served out on the terrace in the morning, he is always there to greet you and get you whatever you want. We have never known hospitality like it. The hotel is also ideally located, right in the centre, only 5 mins to St Mark's Square but just nicely out of the main crowds, to be honest everywhere is walkable in Venice, it is a pleasure to just wander down little alleyways, which bring you out at another lovely square with bars/restaurants etc, but the biggest pleasure was always having this wonderfull hotel to return to.No matter what people say on Trip Advisor, no words can do Matteo and his hotel justice - you will have to go and see for yourself and I envy you if you are going!! We certainly hope to return in the not to distant future. Thank you Matteo and staff for giving my husband and I the most memorable weekend ever.

<Content>Thumbs up I stayed with my husband in Al Ponte Antico for two nights and just from the day we arrived we recieved a warm welcome from the staff and especially Matteo who was just wonderful in every sense. No matter how hard i tried to explain how friendly he was i will not do him justice. We just felt at home and he made sure we are being taking care of by all the staff. For breakfast one can not ask for more...Matteo who made delicious crepes and omelette in addition to the wide variety of food to choose from,which you can all enjoy having in the beautiful terrace. The hotel had an excellect view and the room was really spacious and clean. All of which made our stay in Venice really worthwhile.

<Content>The perfect start to a wonderful vacation! We stayed at the Al Ponte Antico for 2 nights prior to a cruise. I booked this hotel a year in advance and the anticipation of staying there exceeded my expectations which were high to begin with. The deservingly proud owner, Matteo, greeted us warmly by name and showed us our room which was a suite on the first floor. Our room was a little above water level and I felt that I had a front seat view for all the wonders of Venice. Gondolas drifted by right in front of us and other boat traffic went about their everyday business. I liked the location very much. I felt it had more of a neighborhood feel then the area around St. Mark's. The newly renovated breakfast room was gorgeous with an enormous shiny brass espresso, cappuccino machine which made the best coffees. The buffet breakfast with the chocolate banana crepes was a great way to start the day. Drinking my new favorite drink, the spritz, on the terrace and watching the boat traffic was a relaxing way to end our days. Everyone who worked at the Al Ponte Antico went over and beyond trying to please us. They were a happy bunch of people who always had a smile on their faces. I hope the Al Ponte Antico gets kicked up to the #1 spot on tripadvisor. It deserves to be there and more.

<Content>Cant wait to go back again - What can I say that has not been said before, after meeting Matteo in 2007 and having drinks on the terrace (we were staying at their sister hotel) we knew we had to come back and stay with Matteo. Arriving in a water taxi we unloaded our bags and Matteo was there to great us like the old friends we felt we were. We had a wonderful suite (apparently the best in the house) with a very large bedroom, separate lounge/desk area and with two huge windows that opened out onto the water of the Grand Canal. Whilst the bathroom was small, it was very modern and sufficient and the additional space in the suite more than compensated for it. The rooms were clean and the staff were all wonderful, the breakfasts delicious, with the eggs coming from Matteo's grandmothers farm and sitting on the balcony having breakfast in the mornings looking out on the the Grand Canal or drinks in the evening before going for dinner and then back for a nightcap, this was one of the highlights of Venice for us. Our third trip to Venice and staying with Matteo was like staying with a very good friend, but with five star service. A smaller hotel where the guests mingled with each other in the evening on the terrace (if you wished to do so) and there is no other place that we would consider staying in Venice in fact any time we are in Europe it would be a must stop. Cannot recommend this hotel or their sister one enough. Its worth a trip to Venice to stay with these wonderful people in their wonderful home.

<Content>Wonderful! My husband and I spent one night here on our honeymoon in July. We were absolutely impressed, the hotel lived up to all of the great reviews on trip advisor!!We arrived early the day of check-in (8 AMish)- although the room was not yet ready for us, the staff held on to our bags and Matteo, the owner, was gracious enough to offer us breakfast! We loved the terrace and the views of the canal were a great way to start off our stay in Venice. The staff was incredibly gracious and made us feel completely at home right away!!!! The room was spotless and beautifully decorated. We were surprised at the size of the room, definitly the largest one we encountered on our 12 day trip to Europe.My only complaint is we only spent one night at Al Ponte Antico! I cannot say enough good things about the hotel and the owner, Matteo.

<Content>A privileged location with marvellous hospitality I booked this hotel having studied all of the trip advisor reviews and it鈥檚 true, it is a fantastic hotel. Everything exceeded our expectations. We arrived by water taxi (95 Euros) from the airport late in the evening and were greeted by name. Our room, 103, an inside room facing the beautiful bar was lovely. I had worried that we didn鈥檛 have a view, but needlessly so. It was perfect, air conditioning was very effective and the bathroom was lovely.We were warmly greeted the following morning as we stepped out into the luxurious bar/dining area by Matteo, the incredible owner, who speaks to everyone in their own language 鈥?amazing. He guided us to a table on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal, with the Rialto Bridge as a beautiful back drop. We felt welcomed and very special. It was our 25th wedding anniversary and it was just wonderful to absorb the sights and sounds of the Grand Canal, so many varied boats. We were served excellent coffee, availed ourselves of the wonderful buffet. Then, Matteo took our order for omelettes 鈥?or whatever you wished and they were perfect 鈥?he personally cooked them to order. Matteo then took the time to find out our plans and to assist with suggestions, so friendly, so reassuring, so knowledgeable 鈥?just great. He recommended and booked a table at L鈥橭steria di Santa Marina for our special anniversary meal (excellent with wonderful friendly service).The hotel is very well located, as it鈥檚 easy to cross the Grand Canal. After sightseeing we happily returned to the peacefulness of the hotel in the afternoon. After a wonderful meal we sat on the terrace and drank a special bottle of champagne, gazing out at the Rialto Bridge and water 鈥?special memories to keep forever. Matteo assisted with planning our trip to Burano 鈥?nothing was too much trouble. Venice is hot and busy in July but this really is an oasis of calm which is wonderful to return to. The terrace is fantastic, watching all types of boats go by from tourists to delivery boats. Indeed, people crammed onto the waterbuses, gazed up longingly at the terrace as we sipped spritz, champagne, whatever. They knew they鈥檇 rather have been relaxing where we were! We checked out at 12 but the hotel was pleased to keep our bags and to arrange a water taxi for when we left in the evening. On our return we were warmly welcomed onto the terrace where we enjoyed a spritz before our journey home. It was no problem to them at all 鈥?they made us feel very welcome, more like friends than paying guestsIn conclusion, wonderful service (such friendly helpful people), sumptuously decorated rooms, fantastic breakfasts, excellent atmosphere and location. Such a wonderful experience 鈥?it would be very hard to stay anywhere else in Venice after receiving such treatment.

<Content>The Al Ponte Antico is a very special hotel Having booked this hotel based on the reviews on Trip Advisor I was confident the hotel would be what we were looking for. The many great reviews still do not do this hotel justice. The hotel is beautiful and charming, location is fantastic and the service is absolutely impeccable. Having stayed in many hotels in Europe I have never experienced service and hospitality as that at the Al Ponte Antico. I could not recommend this hotel enough, with only nine rooms you are looked upon as individuals, not room numbers. The staff are so friendly, I guarantee you will not get a hotel experience like this anywhere. Don't stay anywhere else, this hotel is simply The Best.

<Content>just perfect After disembarking a 12 night Mediteranean cruise, we had one extra night in Venice before returning home. We wanted it to be special. And it certainly was. The Al Ponte Antico is a beautiful hotel. The location is great. The views of the canal and Rialto bridge are wonderful. But the most outstanding feature to this hotel is the owner, Matteo. His love for the hotel and the city is contagious. We would epecially like to acknowledge Armando for assisting with booking and arrival. And Oliver that shared helpful history and information about the city making our short time well spent. If you are looking for a truly magical place to stay in Venice, this is it!BPKansas City, MO

<Content>Best hotel experience ever - look no further! We stayed at the Hotel Al Ponte Antico for two nights, and I did a ton of research prior to booking a hotel in Venice for our first trip to this amazing city. I read through all of the tripadvisor reviews, and read all of them for this particular establishment. As I browsed through each review, I thought to myself 'how can a hotel possibly have THIS many favorable reviews!. Well, as we checked into the Hotel Al Ponte Antico, this question was clearly answered. This was by far the most wonderful hotel experience we have ever had, and I actually felt a touch of sadness when we had to check out. Matteo and his staff are amazing people, and their hospitality are absolutely incredible. As far as the actual hotel, it is a palace - literally! We had a huge room without a view, but it was wonderful. The terrace of course is a delight, as were Matteo's omelets in the morning. It truely is a breathtaking hotel, and it puts a smile on my face thinking back to our (too) short stay there just one week ago. Believe the reviews - the hotel and staff are spectacular!!!!

<Content>Absolutely the best experience We were treated like royalty. Being greeted by name as our water taxi pulled up to the private dock was just a taste of the wonderful hospitality of Matteo and his staff. The rooms are fabulous, the location can't be beat, the breakfast is marvelous, but what made our stay truly remarkable was the attention we received from everyone at the hotel. We can't wait to return to the hotel. We were in Europe for 17 days and only stayed here for 1 night, but it was a highlight of our vacation. We were 7 people from teenagers to a grandparent and each of us was made to feel special.

<Content>Absolutely Fabulous! Unbelievable service and location! They were marvelous in all areas of their establishment! We were greeted by the owner and given a short tour with details of the restoration of the property. It was absolutely beautiful! Our very large suite had a king and a also a queen sleeper in a separated sitting area. Our three windows opened directly onto the canal at the Rialto Bridge - gondolas came gliding by regularly as did the vaporettis. The windows were new and bocked all sounds when closed! The location was premier fr walking everywhere, which is the way to see Venice. Breakfast was wonderful - omelets, meats, etc. - and was included! We can't wait to stay again!

<Content>Can't imagine staying anywhere else! My wife and I were staying in a non-tourist town outside of Venice for a week (I was there for work), and we were not having a good time. The people in the town and the hotel in which we were staying were not very friendly, and we felt very uncomfortable and uneasy. Once my work was done, we stayed at the Al Ponte Antico for 3 days, and it completely changed everything. Everyone is so helpful, and Matteo and Oliver gave us great advice as to where to eat and when to go to the sights we wanted to see. We will never forget sitting on the terrace in the afternoon, having a drink, and talking with Matteo about life in Venice. When we were looking for a hotel before we took our trip, I thought that this place was a little expensive. However, every review I read talked about how great it is, and after staying there I couldn't agree more. We will definitely return to Venice, and we could not imagine staying at any other hotel.

<Content>Fantastico! My husband and I stayed at Al Ponte Antico with our two children (13 and 9) for 4 nights. We can second all the positive comments made in earlier reviews regarding the excellent staff (esp. Rosalba, Oliviero, and, of course, Matteo), great location, plentiful breakfasts, and the stellar view from the terrace. Matteo's spritzes were so good that we tracked down a local source for one of the ingredients the day after we returned home! Now we can enjoy spritzes at home, but unfortunately without the Grand Canal and Rialto Bridge in our sights. Our room (Al Ponte Sospiro) was great, although perhaps a little tight with the sofa bed opened up. The one negative was the aforementioned elevated tub which meant crouching under the shower head. In terms of noise, we found it very quiet at all times of day.While many honeymooners stay at Al Ponte Antico, we can say that our children felt very welcome there and the staff took excellent care of them.When we go back to Venice, we will definitely stay at Al Ponte Antico again.

<Content>Fabulous! It's hard to think of anything to add since all the other glowing reviews say it all. I can only say that yes, they are all true and yes, it really is that good! The location is fantastic and that terrace on the grand canal a real gem. People going by on the vaporetti were looking at us and pointing as it really is unique to have a terrace on the canal and right by the rialto bridge as well. It is the most fantasic spot in Venice to have breakfast, a coffee, an aperitif or nightcap. The bulding is renovated beautifully in traditional Venetian style with gorgeous fabrics, glass and frescoes. The staff are great. - more like staying with friends than hotel staff. It was fantastic to arrive by private water taxi as it drops you off right in the hotel - expensive but worth it for the experience (the alternative being to walk from the vaporetto stop with your luggage up and down bridges and through the crowds). I absolutely loved this hotel and would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Perfection There have been so many superlative reviews about this hotel, this is yet another. Although our already brief stay in Venice was cut short by an emergency at home we could not have asked for a more supportive and caring staff who helped us re-arrange our return. This exquisite hotel is perfectly situated, has been beautifully renovated and above all has the most wonderful atmosphere. Matteo is the perfect host, kind and informative and his staff reflect his high standards. Prosecco on the terrace in the evening light,watching life in Venice ... wonderful.

<Content>Probably the most amazing weekend break of my life I took my wife for her 30th birthday to the Al Ponte Antico and have to say that our stay there made it possibly the best weekend's holiday either of us have ever had. I was initially a Venice sceptic but the magic of the place, and in particular this hotel, made it truly phenomenal.The location is perfect. Overlooking the canal and the Rialto bridge, just 15 minutes walk from St Marks, right on the main shopping streetsbut quiet and relaxed as well.The staff are the most attentive and friendly you could wish for. Nothing was too much trouble. Prosecco in the room (free) when we arrived for Kate's birthday (I didn't ask for this), help and tips, amazing breakfast and service, drinks until whatever time on the terrace and then a glass of wine (again free) whilst we waited for the water taxi to take us back to the airport. And that view. Simply amazing. You can spend hours with a book, a beer or coffee and that view, Nothiing else. If you want to be in the best location, in the frienliest hotel, with the best service - this is the hotel for you.

<Content>Perfect Start to Honeymoon My bride and I started off the Italian leg of our honeymoon at Matteo's hotel. Perfect location yards away from the Rialto Bridge. It's also probably the only hotel with a veranda on the Grand Canal. Sitting there watching the traffic go by with a glass of white wine was perfect. The room was fantastic: Matteo's attention to detail and design were evident in the textiles, chandeliers, glassware, etc. The staff was A+ as well. Matteo had excellent recommendations for dining as well as helpful advice on best times to visit Venice's busy tourist sites. Although our USD took a beating, this hotel was worth every penny. Our highest recommendation for this hotel. Thanks Matteo for an incredible start to our honeymoon!J and J Burke

<Content>Superb! My husband and I just spent four wonderful nights (and mornings and afternoons) at Matteo's beautiful new small elegant hotel on the Grand Canal. His great hospitality creates a house party atmosphere where guests are treated, and treat each other, like old friends. The wonderful terrace, for breakfast and evening spritzers and whatever else you'd like, provides the remarkable setting. Although near the Rialto bridge, serenity reigns. Al Ponte Antico is a magical place and we will return again and again.

<Content>the fabulous al ponte Antico Venice Hotel al Ponte Antico Trip advisor website london uk my friend and i have just returned from Venice. we stayed in this wonderful hotel right on the grand canal yards from the Rialto Bridge.the setting is awesome all the life of venice passes by as you sit on the lovely terrace watching the world go by.Matteo who is the proud owner of this gem of a hotel is one of the nicest and most helpful people you could ever hope to meet. i mentioned Matteo first obviously as because this is his hotel he must take the credit for his wonderful staff all of them going out of their way to make sure your stay in the hotel is enjoyable. but i must mention them by name Oliver the youngest was so helful to us drawing lines andcircling all the places we wanted to see such a help when you have no idea where you are or in which direction to go he is absolutely lovely young manArmand who during the months before our trip answered all of our queries and sent christmas and easter wishes from all the family and staff of the hotel.i have lived and travelled to a lot of places all over the world and i would unreservedly state that for service that one would perhaps get from close friends and family and attention to detail ensuring a wonderful happy time in Venice this hotel is the best i have ever stayed in and all of the staff are friendly helpful and add to the enjoyment of your holiday we always looked forward to going back to this oasis of peace and quiet in this very busy CIty to sit on the terrace about five in the afternoon with one of Maatteos wonderful spritzers or as my friend preferred a gin and tonic the size of which i for one have never seen before!!!was the perfect wind down from a hectic day and gave us our second wind to go to the San Marco square sit at a table outside of Florians and listen to the lovely music played by a live quartet or quintet play anything from Strauss to Beethoven.This hotel is a must for anyone who values quality and service. we will definitely go back to this hotel and know we will be welcomed as friends rather than guests.

<Content>Simply superb! Booked a 2 night stay at The Al Ponte Antico based entirely on reading previous reviews and I have to say, the customer service and attention to detail at this hotel are second to none. As mentioned in other reviews, Matteo (the owner) greets you on arrival at the hotel by your first name, and along with all the other members of staff, he is always available to help with reccomendations for places to visit / restaurants etc.The terrace which overlooks the Grand Canal  Rialto bridge is wonderful, as are the breaksfasts which are served there every morning. The omlettes in particular are great.The bedroom was larger than I expected, and the large bathroom with jacuzzi bath was another bonus.Venice is a beautiful city and it would be difficult not to have great time there, but I definitely feel that choosing this particular hotel enhanced my trip considerably, so a big thanks to Matteo and all his staff.Franco.

<Content>Charming and Exciting This hotel really gets you in the Venice mood with its friendliness and location in the heart of the action. We were two people in an inner room (no view). It was quite large, and included a king and a comfortable fold out sleeper couch, both comfortable. The bathroom is huge with the jacuzzi tub that is so relaxing. Two terrycloth robes were available for use. The common space is elegant and the adjacent terrace for eatting and drinks is spectacular. One can spend all morning, evening or all day soaking in the brillant view of the Rialto bridge and watercraft of every sort floating by. With drink in hand, you definitely feel privledged looking at the world floating by. The breakfast is outstanding with pasteries, fruit, fresh and hot veggies, and Matteo's fresh omlettes made to order. There is unlimited service of fresh cappacinos or lattes too. The staff is incredibly friendly and just puts a smile on your face, with everyone knowing who you are by name. It is an elegant and fun place to stay. Visitors interact on the terrace and learn about eachother and fun things to do and where to eat in Venice.

<Content>Lucky so and so I鈥檓 looking for a room for the Heineken jammin festival Police concert, June 22 2008 I love the Police. The mix of Sting鈥檚 grooves, Copeland鈥檚 hi-hat spicy playing and Summers鈥?harmonics mistress make me crazy. But the tour date in Venice is also the chance to come back to meet Matteo and all the staff of this little hotel with a strategic location. We stayed here in April 2007, during the start up of Peruch management. We're so lucky.In this context we discovered how deep a man can love his job. Matteo knows Venice inside out an is a gold mine of advices: you can ask him everything about corners to visit, typical shops, caf茅s, bakeries, markets, restaurants, etc. They all are so kind and can made your holydays deeply special. The balcony with its wonderful view on Grand Canal and Rialto Bridge is unforgettable. From this point of view you can spent hours feeling the pulsating daytime life of Venice (the market is on the opposite side of the Canal) and the peacefulness of a romantic moonlight evening. We agree it鈥檚 the best choice for lovers on honeymoon.  Giuseppe e Maria Antonietta  Rome

<Content>Fell in love with Venice ! We just returned from our trip to Venice to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary ! We selected Al Ponte Antico Hotel in Venice based on the ratings from trip Advisor. It was a wonderful boutique hotel ! The location is magnificent, the balcony looks into the Grand canal and has a wonderful view of the Rialto bridge. It used to be an old Venetian Palace and was painstakingly redone by the current owner Mattheo. Mattheo's family have been hoteliers for a long time and he is so passionate about making sure his guests have the best time. There are only 9 rooms and Mattheo and his crew will make you feel like you are the only guest at his wonderful palace. He makes the most delicious omelettes and crepes for you in the morning and don't miss the caffe from his handcrafted coffee machine ! Mattheo knows Venice inside out and gave us good tips - go early to St Mark's square before the day trippers arrive, don't miss the fish market, take the boat to the colourful village of Burano and have luch by the canal at Trattoria al Gatto Nero da Ruggero ( pasta with spider crab was delicious and grilled fresh sardines) . We had really some of the best meals in Venice, enjoy a nice lunch at Alla Maddonna, dinner at Dolo ( try the spicy squid on polenta), dinner at Osteria Boccadero near the Miracle Church ( go with the chef Luciano's recommendations, you won;t go wrong !)Al Ponte Antico has their own private dock, so best Venetian way to get to the hotel is to take a water taxi right up to the dock of the Hotel. Enjoy Venice !

<Content>Superb stay at this outstanding hotel My husband and I were very fortunate to have found this hotel through trip advisor (thank you!) Every review you will read about this hotel does not do it justice. It honestly is a remarkable little hotel which feels more like an inn with an outstanding staff. We stayed for only 3 nights and it felt like we were not patrons of a hotel, but family. Alex (a very friendly staff member) greeted us upon arrival with a huge smile and knew our names like we were long lost siblings. And once we got over the shock of that we were greeted again and again by each staff member. Now how many hotels have you gone to that you know each and every staff member by their names and they know yours? And I'm not even good with remembering names! Matteo, the proprietor, is a charming gentleman. He is welcoming, and sincere, and he stops at no expense to make your stay the best it could possibly be. He is very knowledgeable about Venice and it's history and where to go and what to do. He even ran (yes ran) to a restuarant to make a reservation for us because they were not answering their phones and he wanted us to have the experience of dinning there. Every suggestion he made was bang on and I can without a doubt say that if it were not for Matteo and his staff our visit to Venice would not have been nearly as wonderful as it was. It is obvious that Matteo and all of his staff truly love what they do.The hotel itself is enchanting and very well appointed. Its decor is beautiful and quite luxurious. The terrace overlooks the Rialto bridge. You must realize how rare a terrace with this view is. The terrace is where you can have breakfast or a mid-day cocktail, or a pre-post-any-time cocktail which Matteo prepares himself. We have been lucky enough to have travelled to many beautiful locations and have stayed in many fine hotels and this hotel is truly a gem and one of our very favorites! Bravo Matteo!

<Content>Exceptionally run boutique hotel on Grand Canal near Rialto As reported, Matteo does do a superb job running this wonderfully decored boutique hotel right near the Rialto Bridge. Pros: Matteo, housekeeping and the night staff addressed my wife and me by name EVERY time they saw us. Matteo, being a man of effusive mien, never lets an opportunity for lengthy discussions on the wonders of Venetian life pass him by, is happy to supply recommendations for any activity and seems to have the water bus timetable memorized. Our room (non-suite, non-canal view, 280 Euro/night in late March 2008) was spotless and large for Venice, with vaulted ceilings and full-sized king bed. Our bathroom was also large, with a shower over a jet-fitted tub. Arriving by water taxi directly to the hotel's private dock on the Grand Canal is a great convenience and sets the mood, as does the porter running out to grab our bags whilst introducing himself (and somehow already knowing our names). The hotel's common area, the hall, where breakfast  drinks (full bar) are served (and which leads to the outdoor terrace useful outside of winter) is beautiful. Matteo's Venetian spritzers are in fact good. One evening we went to the Gritti Palace for cocktails and tried their spritzer. On top of the Gritti seeming run-down and frankly a bit depressing, the drink wasn't nearly as piquant, voluminous, or inexpensive. It really made us think that we were getting a much better experience (way beyond the spritzer) at Ponte Antico and for almost a third the room rate (and half the cocktail rate).Cons: Matteo NEVER lets an opportunity for lengthy discussions on the wonders of Venetian life pass him by. Its charming, but sometimes we just want our room key or the tiniest bit of anonymity in our movements and activities. One annoying quirk, because our tub was raised a foot or two off the floor and the bathroom had low ceilings, at just 6'0 I had to hunch considerably to stand in the shower and had to fully squat to get my hair wet. If I were any taller or had a bad back I would have needed to switch rooms. Just when you start thinking that you're staying in a five star hotel for a three star price, the motel-style shrink wrapped complimentary bathroom toiletries and small tube TV remind you that you aren't (but those are, in my opinion, trades I'm happy to make for the reasonable room rate). AC was entirely non-functional, but we didn't complain or investigate further as our window kept the room temperature manageable; maybe it's only activated in warmer months. The hotel is very quiet, and our room was just off the common hall, so we could hear conversations outside (and vice versa). It would have been nice to have had the option for audio privacy with some AC or fan created white noise.On balance, given the excellent location, enthusiastic management, room condition, decor  ambiance, and fair room rate, I would absolutely return and will recommend the Ponte Antico to friends and family without hesitation. Bravissimo, Matteo.

<Content>The Highlight of Venice!!!!!! My wife and I were on our honeymoon and spent 3 weeks touring Italy. Matteo and this hotel are still the subject of many of our stories. And we stayed in many 4-5 star hotels. This place has it all. Service, location, spacious rooms with a view and gourmet breakfast on the terrace every morning and wine in the evening on the Grand Canal!!! Unbelievable! And, Matteo is the keystone. He is so passionate about his work. It is his life. Without a doubt when we return to Venice, this is the only place for us to stay.

<Content>A very warm welcome and a wonderful hotel My wife and I had the pleasure of staying in this wonderful hotel in February 2008. It enjoys a fantastic central location, is extremely comfortable and furnished and decorated in an appropriately opulent manner. The welcome was amongst the most warm and friendly that I have experienced in any hotel and the justifiably proud owner could not have been more helpful.

<Content>Great service, room and location. Stayed here for 4 nights in Feb. The location, beside the Rialto bridge is superb - everything within easy walking distance. Our room (No. 102) was lovely - high-ceilinged and spacious with chandelier, comfortable couch and armchairs and two beautiful, tall windows that opened onto an unobstructed view of the Grand Canal. The bathroom was small but perfectly adequate. The hotel has free wireless internet access in all the rooms and the service is, as other reviewers have said, truly special . Matteo and his staff were unfailingly convivial, generous, courteous and thoughtful and made us feel as if nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was delicious - unlimited coffee, a buffet of all kinds of everything, eggs or crepes cooked to order if front of you. Overall, a great place.

<Content>Perfect Break Perfect place to stay. Venice was beautiful at this time of year and we were especially lucky with the weather - brilliant sunshine every day!Matteo  his team were the usual excellent hosts and after our 4 night stay I felt we had completely unwound and relaxed.We stayed in one of the suites with an amazing view of the canal and it was definitely worth paying that little bit more.The only bad point - we had to leave!

<Content>Absolutely the highlight of our summer vacation!! We were fortunate to stay at this property both prior to and after a summer 2007 7-day cruise, and even now, several months later, our entire family counts our stay with Matteo and his staff as a highlight of our entire vacation. It is a small 9-room hotel located directly on the Grand Canal just a few meters from the Rialto Bridge. Although it was still in the process of renovation at the time of our stay (Matteo had just taken over the property a few months earlier...) we loved it. Getting around Venice is incredibly easy from this location.Our stay included not only a junior suite (directly on the Grand Canal), but also a triple room, as we were traveling with 3 adult children. The hotel easily accommodated us, and similar to the experience of many other writers on this forum, Matteo personally greeted us by name upon our arrival by private water taxi at the hotel's dock. He and his staff made numerous valuable dining, touring and shopping reccomendations during our stay. We were treated like favorite family members the entire time. Even when one of our children was taken ill, Matteo graciously moved him to a quiet third room. Perhaps my favorite memory was the look of total awe of each of my family members as they first entered the junior suite. We could easily have passed a glass of wine to a passing gondoleer; the room was that perfect!Ahhh, the wonderful terrace and those famous omelets need no further accolades! .Thanks, Matteo! We hope to see you soon.

<Content>Location and staff is really great, but very cold Location is the best in Venice and I mean it. It's 50 meters from Rialto and if you'll select Junior Suite number 1, you'll have the best room with great view to canal.Staff is very welcoming, everyone knows your first name and they are really helpful - you'll get answer to each of your questions, including e.g. history of the hotel.Room (Junior #1) is very spacious, bed is OK, but -- it's so cold! We setuped temperature to 30 degrees, but there was around 18 degrees or maybe less (January)! It's probably because of the water in the canal, but it could be improved for 550 Euros/night, including better bathroom is a must. The rooms are exactly the same as on their web pages, so you can check it there. There is also really great breakfast room.Free (fast) wifi internet is bonus and overall it's really nice and unique place.

<Content>Family run, Prime Service - They really get it. This family run business really makes you feel at home in the heart of Venice! They understand hospitality, and offer a special experience that can't be duplicated anywhere else. We had a beautiful room with canal view (although the breakfast lounge was outside our window, so privacy was not the best). Ask them anything, and they will help you get what you want! Definitely recommended!

<Content>Al Ponte Antico Hotel a special place to stay in Venice I visited Hotel Al Ponte Antico in July 2007 with my husband and family. We arrived to a warm welcome, comfortable well appointed roomsand a level of service seldomly seen in large hotels. They gave us great advice on where to eat, organising bookings on our behalf.This family run Hotel and their staff truly understand the needs of travellers and go the extra distance to give you a great experience. Highly recommended for families.Angela from Melbourne Australia

<Content>Belongs on any "Best of the Best" List Like most others who have stayed here, we cannot say enough positive things about this hotel. Matteo, the owner, and the rest of the staff make sure that every detail of your stay is taken care of, from airport-hotel transfers to restaurant recommendations and sight-seeing and shopping tips. The hotel itself is lovely; we were in one of the supposedly smaller (classic) rooms, which was still quite large and beautifully decorated with king-size bed and an immaculate, fully appointed bathroom (hair-dryer, towel warmer, toiletries, etc.). Breakfast is wonderful, with custom-made omelets or crespelle as well as a buffet including fresh fruit, vegetables, breads, yogurt and cereals. Although the hotel does not at this point have a public bar or full kitchen, the staff is always happy to pour a glass of wine or to brew a latte for you to enjoy on the patio [shared by all guests] in the afternoon or evening, and the view of the Grand Canal is incredible. All of the staff speak impeccable English and know the city intimately, and their enthusiasm for Venice is contagious. A note to anyone who is not familiar with the hotel rating system for Venice: I was somewhat hesitant to stay in a supposedly three star hotel when I first booked at Al Ponte Antico. However, this is merely a three-star hotel ONLY because it does not have the kitchen and other public facilities that are a prerequisite for higher ratings in Venice. It easily equals (and in the important ways far surpasses) four and five star hotels I have stayed in in other cities.

<Content>Special!! We celebrated a special anniversary , and wanted a suitable hotel and destination.As a serial user of TripAdvisor, I tried to book the top rated bb in Venice, a method that has yet to fail to date, only to find it full.They informed me that Matteo was to open his Hotel the following week, on April 10th.We took a chance.................. and we are so pleased we did!We have stayed in many Hotels with better rooms and facilities, but, none were overlooking Rialto Bridge on the Gran Canal, and none had service to match that of Matteo and his team. We had a terrific time!We did feel a tad guilty though..... we withdrew to the balcony most afternoons, to drink champagne and watch the ever changing tapestry of life on the canal , just like a Caneleto.So, in a nutshell, you can believe all these stunning reviews.But don't tell anyone else, we will never be able to get a room again!

<Content>Best. Hotel. Ever. This hotel shouldn't only be top rated in Venice, it should be top rated in the world.Many of the reviews have already covered the personal service you receive from Matteo and his staff at the Al Ponte Antico. It is all true and then some.The hotel has a great ambience, and with a fabulous view across the Grand Canal, of the Rialto Bridge, where you can enjoy fabulous cocktails and drinks on the terrace.Breakfasts were the best I have ever had from a hotel, with Matteo himself preparing fresh eggs, exactly to your taste to order, cooked in front of you. I personally would recommend his omelette.Also, Matteo took care of all our restaurant reservations, after discussing what type of cuisine we were looking for. We enjoyed Venetian cuisine, which was centered around the local seafood.When we revisit Venice, we won't even bother looking for anything else, as this is the place to stay. Matteo is undergoing major renovations, which will make the hotel feel even more grand, in January 2008.

The help and advice we received from Matteo, Oliviero and all the staff was second to none. All the restaurant recommendations were excellent ; the advice on where to walk etc was brilliant. We were very grateful to be right in the centre but in such a calm oasis. They made us feel so welcome instantly - we can not wait to go back.

<Content>Intimate and charming hotel in enviable location There is no doubt that the staff at this intimate, unique and charming hotel on the Grand Canal offer a service that is second to none. Personally, as a shy and self-conscious English woman, I found Matteo's personal attention over effusive and uncomfortable but I realise that the issue is entirely mine and that Matteo's enthusiasm for attending to the needs of his guests and his passion for his city is both sincere and inspirational. His staff are equally helpful and friendly and welcomed us with genuine attentiveness. The location of the Al Ponte Antico is perfect and the views of the Rialto Bridge from the terrace are unforgettable. Do not miss the opportunity to linger over a glass of wine and watch the sun set over the Grand Canal. Our room with views of the Grand Canal was beautiful, spacious and clean. Within seconds of stepping out of the hotel you are absorbed into the maze of enchanting alleys and streets and within very easy reach of St Marks Square.I thoroughly recommend this exquisite hotel and wish you a memorable stay.

<Content>Outstanding! We have just returned from Italy and the jewel of the trip was our stay in Venice. Matteo and his staff are truly unique and only add to the beauty of this hotel. I would highly recommend the Jr Suite with windows that open onto to the grand canal. It is mesmerizing to watch Venice go by literally out side your window. Breakfasts on the terrace are amazing. It is hard to believe that Matteo cooks personally for all guests. Venice is loaded with tourists and it was so enjoyable to return to our very private suite on the canal each day. This hotel is going to be difficult to book as word gets out. Matteo has only had the property since April and has plans for renovation. So reserve well in advance!

<Content>Superb, beautiful setting We have just returned from a wonderful experience at the Al Ponte Antico, our first trip to Venice. It was a special trip so we studied numerous hotels and chose this for location and great reviews. Still you never can tell until you arrive but this was everything and more we had hoped for. We felt very lucky to be stopping in a beautiful suite with french windows opening on to the Grand Canal , watching Venetian life pass by. The staff were unbelievable led by Matteo and his personal touch, nothing was too much trouble. He spent lots of time making all feel welcome and he is rightfully proud of the breakfasts he cooks each day , particularly his family's eggs. There are undoubtedly larger and more famous hotels to stay in but we would definitely have this as our first choice again. I do fear now that vacancies will be hard to come by but it is only fair people get to know about this special place.

<Content>What A Wonderful Experience Matteo, the owner and his staff have prefected the art of hotel management. They knew and remembered our names and were available every moment to help in our visit to their great city of Venice. They made dinner reservations for us and recommended several places. They provided maps to help us navigate the streets and get from place to place. The breakfasts were to die for, (Italian breakfasts are not like the USA) but Matteo made them individually for us from scratch. The hotel was beautiful with the best location in Venice. I will go back here every time I visit.

<Content>The Way Venice Should Be Experienced..... We stayed at the Al Ponte Antico Hotel for 2 nights in July 2007. The location of the hotel cannot be beat - they have a lovely patio that sits directly above the Grand Canal. It is the perfect place to enjoy breakfast or a drink. The rooms were comfortable, clean and modern. The true draw to this hotel, however, is the owner and his staff. Matteo loves the city of Venice and wants all of his guests to enjoy the city as much as he does. The staff were always ready to assist with a dinner reservation, directions or even an umbrella. Matteo personally cooked our breakfast and made sure he was present for our arrival and departure. This hotel is all about the people and experiencing Venice the way it should be with the help of locals who love the city!!!!Dave  Kim (Denver, Colorado)

<Content>Best Hotel We Ever Stayed At!!!! We took a water taxi directly from the airport to the hotel dock (90-100E), well worth the price for convenience if you are not travelling lightly.We were warmly greeted by Mateo, the hotel, who propmtly took our bags inside for us.Our stay at Al Ponte Antico was simply fantastic! Mateo and all his staff knew us by first name. In the morning we would wander out onto an amazing balcony overlooking the Grand Canal, and the Rialto bridge. We were served a lovely breakfast, with outstanding coffee (doppio espresso my recommendation), and eggs done anyway fresh from Mateo Aunt's farm.In the afternoon, we would enjoy a glass of wine on the same balcony before heading out to explore options for supper. Mateo was always ready to help with suggestions, or arrange tours on our behalf, etc..The only problem with staying at this hotel is that everywhere else we stayed in Parma and Bologna for the rest of our trip seemed a bit dull!!!This hotel is amazing, mainly due it's owner Mateo, who has a true passion for what he does.

<Content>The best place in Venice After reading so many reviews about this hotel, we decided to book 2 nights here. We already had a hotel in Mestre through Priceline.com that we couldn't cancel. However, even with the extra expense, we were very happy with our change of hotels.  Matteo is the hotel! He made us great breakfasts, coffee drinks, and guided us to restaurants in Venice. Our room (#1 )was behind the balcony. It was beautifully decorated with high ceilings, fabric walls and a large chandelier. We paid 90e for our water taxi to the hotel (that seemed to be the going rate) from the airport. It cost 80e to our cruise ship at the pier by water taxi. It was very easy going by water taxi with all our luggage. It was worth it....We enjoyed our afternoons out on the balcony meeting other guests and talking with Matteo. The staff and Matteo were always available, friendly and very helpful during our stay. We will recommend this as the best hotel to stay. However, we know that it will probably be hard to ever get a room there again since the word is out!

<Content>Fabulous Stay at a Perfect Hotel My husband and I recently stayed 3 nights at this great bed and breakfast. We were thrilled with this hidden gem. The terrace was fabulous, breakfast was amazing, the location is fantastic, however, the BEST thing about this hotel is the wonderful cast of characters that you will meet. Mateo and Oliver were terrific! They truly made our stay in Venice MAGICAL ~ Thanks!

<Content>Loved the hotel... but don't love the refund lag Had I written this review immediately after our stay the hotel would have received my highest review. We stayed at Al Ponte Antico as part of our honeymoon in Italy. We had a large room on the first floor that looked out onto the Grand Canal. The room was very spacious, nicely decorated, and well kept. It wasn't the furnishings or the stunning location right across from the Rialto bridge that really sold the hotel, it was the staff. The staff were very accomodating and recommended only wonderful restaurants for us to visit off the beaten tourist track. Matteo, the owner makes delightful crapes and omlettes in the morning that you can eat overlooking the beautiful canal.We loved our stay, however we have had a terrible time resolving a billing issue with this hotel. When we checked out, the hotel mistakenly charged us 240 euros over our internet booked rate. We caught the error on the train ride out of Venice and immediately called and spoke with Matteo who assured us that they would refund the difference. After multiple phone calls, e-mails, and now 1 1/2 months into a charge dispute with American Express, I still haven't received my 240 euros back. This I find unacceptable which is why I warn you to be very careful when paying your bill.

<Content>Great stay at Ponte Antico Just returned from a 4 night stay at Al Ponte Antico. We could not have chosen a better hotel...location and service. Matteo, Oliver and the rest of the staff are gratious, warm and accommodating. You never once felt rushed or bothered by asking questions about the area - restaurants, museums, travel etc. Everyone is willing to please you and help make your stay not just at Ponte Antico memorable but in Venice as well. Thanks Matteo, Oliver and everyone else for adding another alluring reason to return to Italy! Bene grazie! Nick and Blythe..

<Content>What a find We have just returned from 5 days staying at this wonderful hotel. The personal service provided by Matteo (the Owner) and his team was second to none. They made dinner reservations for us and ensured we were able to obtain tickets to the Ennio Morricone concert in St Marks Square.The hotel itself is small and exquisite we stayed in Room number 8 which had the most fantastic view over the Grand Canal, the furnishings and decor totally fitting for the room, the bathroom was compact however the hydro massage shower was great.Matteo the owner personally cooks breakfast to order each morning and the eggs are from his grandmother's farm, his pancakes were incredible.Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and we will certainly return and occupy the same room if possible

<Content>hated this hotel We stayed in one of the most darkest blue room ever. Only stayed one night checked out the next day at extra cost to ourselves, we were suppose to stay for 4. We Checked in at Llassidi Palace 3nights,(our other choice) and that made our 25th wedding celebration a memorable one for the right reasons. I am gobsmacked this hotel has this rating as there are so many more far better hotels than this. Try Metropole Hotel, that hotel should have this rating. We have stayed there twice,since and will be going again. They offer good rates and is so close to St Marks Square.Just remember not everyone writes review, so the ratings are not 100% accurate.If you use this hotel, I do really believe you will be disappointed for the money you'll pay.Try other hotels before this one.

<Content>A wonderful welcome awaits you at this marvellous hotel You can be assured of a very warm welcome at this lovely hotel and the best service from Matteo and his staff. The hotel is very centrally located and only a stones throw from the Rialto bridge. You can watch the world go by on the Grand Canal from the hotel terrace.From the hotel you can easily walk around the city and enjoy the sights of Venice.The service is fantastic and Matteo is on hand with lots of local knowledge if you need any advice. He will tell you about the best place to pick up a gondolas or recommend or book a restaurant for you if you wish.The hotel is exceptionally clean and smart and the home cooked breakfasts are very special.You can arrive at this hotel in style as the water taxi lands at the hotels own landing station. It is a great experience to pick up a water taxi at the airport and travel up the grand canal to the hotel. I think we paid 80 euros for that.

<Content>Magical Venetian Palace Wow! We arrived by Water Taxi and no sooner had we pulled up to the Hotel when we were greeted by Matteo. He knew who we were and was expecting us. Things just got better from there. We were introduced to the staff and then went out to look out on the Grand Canal. The Rialto Bridge is right there. We had the opportunity to stay in 2 rooms. Each room has a theme. The first room was large; it has 18 foot ceilings, a large bathroom. It was clean; the decor was meticulous in its planning. On the second night we moved to one of the rooms overlooking the Canal. Again another large room that had windows that went almost from the floor to the ceiling (again 18 foot ceilings.) The staff is very attentive, very friendly and helpful. Over all the Hotel is very clean, beautiful, romantic and quintessentially Venetian. The breakfast was a lot more that the usual continental breakfasts that you typically get. In fact Matteo will prepare your eggs the way you want them (with eggs from his grandmothers). He will also cook you, the Italian version of a Crepe. Fantastic. I have to say that this is not just a Hotel it is the person and that person is Matteo. His is the Hotel and the Hotel is him. He lives it and pays attention to every little detail; it's all about professional service and a warm feeling. All his recommendations for around town were great, his knowledge of history and genuine love of the city is embodied in this place. Book it now, because in a year you probably won't be able to get into this place due to the long wait list. Thank you Matteo and we will see you soon.

<Content>It Is The Destination. Upon arrival my husband, 16 year old son, and myself were graciously greeted by Mateo as if he had been eagerly awaiting our arrival.. During our 4 night, 5 day stay (we arrived early and stayed till 5pm), their attentiveness never faltered, and the entire staff was gracious and helpful. Our friends were staying elsewhere which they regretted after seeing our hotel. They were shown the kindest hospitality while visiting us, and were invited to have drinks with us on the most beautiful veranda in the world.The location on the Grand Canal is perfect, just placed on the curve of the canal with a view of the Rialto on one side and looking down the canal on the other. Each day we looked forward to relaxing and drinking Mateo's wonderful spritzes. Their flexibility was incredible, and even when we were very late, Mateo would always offer to make us a drink, whatever we fancied.We couldn't wait to get to the veranda for breakfast and tried to make it last as long as possible. Mateo always took our orders along with a beautiful fresh buffet. Cappuccino, hot chocolate, crepes, omelets, fresh fruit, cereals, meats, cheese, and pastries. The Rialto, streets, and markets were crowded, but at Al Ponte Antico the veranda was very quiet and private, and we will remember it as the most gorgeous and comfortable spot in the world.We were in a downstairs room facing the canal with a spectacular view. In the evenings I would sit in the window admiring the romantic view of gondolas passing by in the moon light. At bedtime (2am) I would close the wooden shutters, and find our room very quiet and dark until we woke up around 10am. I loved opening the shutters to the noise and action of the day. The bathroom was mostly marble with a nice shower and the room extremely large by European standards, both very clean.There is a romantic little dock outside this room, which is private unless the only accessible door is rarely unlocked for people who are arriving or departing by boat taxi.. We loved departing on a boat taxi, although it was quite an expense. Make sure to ask the cost. The Vaporeto stop is quite close, and an adequate alternative, just a bit clumsy with the suitcases.The little (or large) extras included complimentary laundry, Mateo's spritzes (and for our 3 friends), fabulous recommendations and reservations for lunch, dinner, shopping, and tours. They didn't miss a beat.. Everyone was interested and helpful on a daily basis.Mateo's family took possession of this hotel just last spring, and they have made many changes already, with more improvements planned for this fall. Al Ponte Antico Hotel has become our favorite hotel, and we are looking forward to our next stay.It is the destination.. It is wonderful...Bravo

<Content>Absolutely Fabulous!!! This is the most amazing hotel! It is RIGHT on the Grand Canal, with amazing views of the Rialo Bridge and the Canal in the other direction. It has a gorgeous breakfast terrace - we spent all our afternoons out there just enjoying the sunshine and the activity, it's just wonderful!And the staff!!! Matteo is just wonderful, and his staff will do anything to ensure that you have the best time in Venice. We were given great advice for restaurants, activities and places to visit, and all recommendations were well deserved. Matteo's omlettes are wonderful too - no boring breakfasts here, only a delicious, relaxed and filling start to the day.The room was lovely and big, with a great bathroom, heaps of room to stretch and relax. We loved our stay at Al Poonte Antico Hotel, and would absolutely recommend it to everyone going to Venice!

<Content>The Best Small Hotel in the World! We have just returned from a wonderful stay at this hotel. We loved it so much we extended our planned 2 nights to 5 nights. Here's what we loved:Fabulous, friendly, attentive service from Matteo and his staff.The hotel's unique position right on the Grand Canal - not set back several yards with a noisy terrace restaurant underneath as is the case with other Canal-side hotels. A previous reviewer wasn't impressed by the Grand Canal - I fail to see how although I accept everyone's taste is different. I loved watching Venice on its way to work in the morning - and on its way home of an evening when we'd get a wave from passing commuters as we raised a glass to them. it's a real living breathing city and if you want the sanitised version there's always The Venetian in Vegas!!The location generally - everything you want to see is a gentle few minutes stroll and in the case of St Mark's Square you will pass fabulous shops and gorgeous views round every corner so you will barely notice the walk. The Accademmia (art gallery) is a bit further - probably 20 minutes stroll which can be a bit much in the searing summer heat but take the vaporetto practically door to door.Breakfast on the beautiful terrace with freshly cooked pancakes  omelettes, and then evening cocktails on the terrace - the drinks tasted so much better here than anywhere else in Venice!Room 102 with its amazing view of the Canal, fabulously efficent air conditioning (necessary in the 90 degree July heat) and elegant furnishings. (We had to move to Room 105 for last 2 nights - no view but still a very nice big room (European standards) but air con not quite as glacial as I like!)Matteo's brilliant daily advice to ensure we saw the best of Venice - not just the usual tourist haunts - we also loved his restaurant recommendations particularly Trattoria Marco Polo.Here's a few things to be aware of:The few negative reviews on TripAdvisor pre-date Matteo's ownership.Probably only 4 of the 9 rooms have canal views - otherwise you will look onto a fairly dark courtyard or alley however you have the fabulous terrace at your disposal and how much time will you spend looking out of the window? Room 107 has its own charming little shady courtyard. Room 103 is a bit on the small side if you're a couple travelling with fair amount of luggage.It's worth forking out for the water taxi right to hotel's own launch - otherwise the vaporetto (numbers 1 or 82) lets you off the other side of Rialto bridge - only a few minutes away but it'll feel longer with luggage as you'll have a few sets of steps to negotiate plus the crowds of course and then you can easily miss the hotel's very unprepossessing street entrance from a rather dark alley.Everyone we met during our 5 night stay loved the hotel and I feel sure you will too.

<Content>Perfect place The Hotel is well situated next to the Rialto with a terrace to chill out in the evening or the place to have breakfast on the Gran Canale. Our suite was spacious and well equipped. The manager is really hepful, friendly and makes the whole experience complete. When I'll return to Venice, I know where to stay.

<Content>A very special hotel!!! It is so wonderful to see this property deservedly rise up the ranks on Tripadvisor....when we booked in late May I believe it was ranked at no. 80 right when the owners of Locanda Orseolo took over. Needless to say we LOVED our stay at Al Ponte Antico. The location, views and terrace were a treat, however the reviews are absolutely true about the management.....Matteo and his staff are 'A Number One' when it comes to caring customer service. They make it a point to remember your face, your name, your daily itinerary always accompanied by a warm welcoming smile. Matteo's level of personal care is very, very special and spoils you to the degree that no other hotel (irregardless of rating or no. of stars) will come close to matching it. It is simply priceless.We loved our two week stay in Italy and Al Ponte Antico will always have a special place in our hearts. The best hotel we have ever stayed....highly, highly recommended!!!

<Content>Ahhhh..... Venice! Matteo and his staff at the Al Ponte Antico are what made this such a special place to stay. Yes, the location is fantastic. Yes, the hotel was very very nice. Yes, the view from the breakfast terrace has to be seen to be believed. And yes, Venice can have that effect on you. But it was the service and the people that made our stay all the more special. Matteo made dinner reservations for us each night at places he suggested and they were always spot on. Drinks and a friendly chat on the terrace of an evening before heading out for the night were always a highlight of our day. And the fact that the staff made you feel like friends staying for the evening at their home rather than merely a guest in their hotel made us very sad to leave. We can't wait to come back!

<Content>The Finest Hotel I've Stayed In My girlfriend and I have been lucky enough to stay in many hotels around the world at our comparatively young age and this is the finest hotel by far. No five star hotel can supply the experience that Al Ponte Antico and its staff do. Rooms were spacious and beautifully appointed with antique furniture, try the junior suite overlooking the grand canal for soemthing extra special. Breakfast was the finest I've had with Matteo on hand to cook omelettes or pancakes filled with anything and everything.The service was brilliant. Matteo was full of suggestions and we felt leaving that we genuinely made friends with our hosts. We will be back next year when hopefully the rock concert won't be called off! Thanks to Matteo and all the staff,Paul  Eibhlin.

<Content>Magnifico... Have just returned from a 3 night stay here and would readily recommend the hotel to everyone. It is ideally located on the Grand Canal with fantastic views from the terrace, day and night (and your room if you're lucky to get the same one as we did). Hotel transfers are usually tedious but if you travel by water taxi from the airport, the transfer to this hotel's private dock is a part of the Venetian experience not to be missed. Despite the central location, our room was spacious and quiet. Matteo is a refined and charming host whose command of English will, no doubt, put many of his future English-speaking visitors to shame! Ben fatto and grazie to the whole team; I could have stayed for a month.

<Content>A true spirit of Hospitality! What a wonderful experience we had at this hotel! I had read several reviews prior to booking this hotel and they were true! Matteo and all his staff are what make this hotel such a gem! We arrived on May 15th, and were greeted by name and with a warm welcome by the owner himself. In an age where customer service has truly gone out the window, this hotel is an example of the best customer service we have ever received. Matteo was very helpful and informative. He makes you feel like you are the most important client he has ever had. Truly! :o} The hotel is beautiful as well. We had the jr. suite with a view of the Rialto Bridge (wonderful!). In the afternoons, we would come back to the hotel and have some delicious cappucinos on the Terrace overlooking the canal. We recommend this hotel very highly. They truly make you feel like you are family and go the extra mile for anything you have need of! I can't wait to be back!

<Content>A Gem of a Hotel Veneto, Italy: No longer a hidden gem. Absolutely MagnificentDate: May 2007Reviewer: Trip Advisor Member, Greenbrae, CaliforniaMatteo and Barbara, owners and their staff made us feel like family. Located 300 yards from the Rialto Bridge, which can be seen in full, directly on the Grand Canal with their own private boat dock and patio for breakfast and cocktails, this is the best location in all of Venice. Easily reached by water taxie or Vaporetto from Train station or Airport and return. Rooms are spacious, high ceilings, we had a king bed, bathrooms are large and modern. Breakfast can be a cold cerel, fruit, coffee, espresso, latte, juices, sweets, and eggs made to order or crepes.Sitting on the patio after a full day of sight-seeing sipping a cocktail and watching boats on the Grand Canal or people on the Rialto is very relaxing. Matteo is helpful is recommending Trattorias or restaurants for dinner. This is a 3 star now, but don't wait any longer, improvements are in the works, and a 4th star is more than likely in the future.The location is fabulous, walk outside the front door and your shopping, eating and exploring begin. Near St.Marks Square, Guggenheim Museum, Ghetto, Symphony, Vaporetto stops to everywhere, Al Ponte Antico is the Place to stay in Venice. Thank you Matteo. Paolo  Sylvia

<Content>Fantastic Hotel - We will be back Arrived back last night from our 3 night stay at the above hotel. My husband didn't want me to review the hotel as he didn't want everyone else knowing how good it is!!!It has just been taken over by the Peruch family and is run by Matteo with help from Armando, Tomaso, Bruno and Rosalba, and probably others but whose names I didn't get, apologies if I have missed anyone out.We arrived very late on Thursday but had wonderful greeting from Tomaso who helped us to our room, we booked a junior suite with a view of the Grand Canal, and I have to say it is one of the nicest rooms we have ever stayed in, and we travel a lot.My husband had a business meeting the next day but Matteo promised to look after myself and our 10 year old son Sam, he started off by cooking me an omelette for breakfast and Sam pancakes, but breakfast also consists of fruit, croissants, cheese, ham, salami, yoghurt, cereal. Nothing was too much trouble.After a day wondering round San Marco and the Rialto and whilst waiting for my husband to return, myself and my son sat on the Terrace watching the world go by, it was a wonderful experience.Matteo kindly arranged a reservation for us at a restaurant which was fantastic, food and wine perfect, in a perfect square.We had a brilliant l stay and there are many superlatives I could say about the hotel, but they would not explain what a good ttime we had. Matteo is a wonderful host, a great help with advise on gondola rides, restaurants and any others things we pestered him about, even to the knack of knowing when myself and Sam were lost in Venice, finding us and directing us back to the hotel!!I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would go back in a heartbeat. In fact we normally go to the US for a week in Feb, but I think we may be going somewhere else this year!Many thanks Matteo and to all your team for a wonderful stay, you really introduced us to Venice for which we are all very grateful.Lesley, Wes and Sam
