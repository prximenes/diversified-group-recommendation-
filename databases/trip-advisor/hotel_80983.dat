<Content>The Drisco is a gem in a neighborhood of gems Selected for its residential neighborhood, historic qualities and small size, the Hotel Drisco did not disappoint. The hotel has a club-like atmosphere with very friendly and professional staff. Each member of this staff was always ready to do whatever they could to make our stay more comfortable and enjoyable, from front desk personnel to the housekeeping staff. However, and this is very important to us, they were never intrusive, a quality we sometimes find unappealing at a bed and breakfast. Guests should know that the hotel has added the service of hot panini sandwiches, available on a 24-hour basis, which demonstrates the concern the hotel has that nothing contributing to guest convenience has been overlooked.After our first experience over Christmas at this hotel, we have already booked in for the same time next year. The two-room suite with beautiful Bay view is a perfect place to enjoy a home-like holiday.

<Content>There's no better place to stay We spent 2 nights at the Drisco in late October, and I have to say I had the best time ever in San Francisco, despite the terrible weather that time of the year. We arrived late in the evening, and were still greeted by the helpful, extremely friendly doorman who gave some good advise on where to park our vehicle and spend some good amount of time showing us the hotel.Our room was decently sized, certainly not huge, but that's not what you'd expect in SF anyways, and beautifully decorated. The bed was comfy and the TV/DVD combo just awesome. Not to mention every little corner in our room was perfectly clean and in top notch condition.We enjoyed the breakfeast but did not attend any of the wine receptions as we never made it back to the hotel in time. However, there are always some cookies, free coffee and tee available in the cosy, living room-style lounge room next to the reception, along with a selection of daily newspapers.And it's also about the location, too - away from the tourist crowd of Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square, yet in walking distance of many of the downtown dining, cultural and shopping attractions. Situated on top of Pacific Heights, you'll have a hard time finding a more up-scale neighborhood. You'll find a number of good restaurants right next door on Fillmore.Bottom line, I visit the bay area quite frequently on both business and leisure, and this was the best find ever on trip advisor. Won't stay anywhere else when going to downtown SF.

<Content>delightful home away from home What an outstanding hotel in every way! The rooms are so beautiful, clean and comfortable, I would say they are beyond compare. The staff is thoughtful in a way that they anticipate your needs before you even think of what they are. Michael is exquisitely kind and helpful, without us even asking. That is the kind of service that pervades the hotel. Michael's associate, Eduardo, at the front desk, provided us a gorgeous upgraded room. We were stunned when we entered the suite, because Eduardo gave us the upgrade without taking credit for it. It was only when we went downstairs to thank him that it was mentioned. This gracious behavior is a trait of every employee in the hotel. The afternoon wine service was so relaxing and delicious and Julio was wonderful. Another staff member, Eduardo, fixed our internet access! I could go on and on, but most of all, the natural, unspoken kindness that is an obvious philosophy of the hotel is simply an example to all of us. I hope we have an opportunity to stay at this jewel again soon.

<Content>Wonderful place to stay! We absolutely loved our stay at the Hotel Drisco. Many years ago, I lived on Union Street down the steep hill from the hotel) and wanted to spend some time in my old neighborhood. We selected the Drisco because of its location and its excellent reviews. We were not disappointed.The staff was warm and accommodating, even calling us in advance to see if there was anything that they could do to make our stay more enjoyable. I had mentioned that this was a sentimental journey, and we were upgraded to a charming one-bedroom suite. We thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon wine and cheese and conversation with another guest. Dinner recommendations were excellent.The only downside of the hotel is that it is not convenient to Bart, however the Pacific Heights neighborhood more than makes up for this. We were able to get around using public transportation. Buses run regularly, and there were bus lines a few blocks away.

<Content>Super Star Drisco Dumfries, ScotlandOur week's stay at the Hotel Drisco at the end of October 2008 surpassed all our expectations! We were going on holiday with our son, his wife, and three wee ones, aged 5,3, and 10 months and had been delegated the task of finding a hotel suited to all our needs, a tall order! After reading Tripadvisor's rating of the hotel as No 1 in San Francisco we made a phone call, spoke to Marti on Reception, had a 2 bedroom suite recommended, followed this up with a booking which proved to be one of our best decisions ever! We adults and the children were treated with the utmost kindness. Nothing was a bother to all the staff. The standard of accommodation is excellent, but there is also a genuine warmth of welcome and a desire to ensure guests every comfort, Our son, his wife, and family are relocating in Summer 2009 to San Francisco from Edinburgh,Scotland, for two years, and it was very important that this first visit should make a favourable impression of the city. Hotel Drisco certainly was the perfect home from home for us all, particularly our 3year old grandson who, during our stay, started to call the hotel my other house! We found the stylish and most comfortable 2bedroom suite ideal for a family, as the adults had a delightful sitting room to relax in after busy days visiting schools, checking out areas to live, sightseeing, etc. The children could be peacefully sleeping in the bedrooms, necessary after transatlantic flights and a time change! Beds were superbly comfortable too!The excellent complimentary breakfasts and evening wine and cheese, and 24 coffee/tea/iced water in the elegant lounge were a bonus to our comforts. Other guests were very friendly too, contributing to the warm ambiance created by the Manager and all his first class staff.The situation is stunning with a view down to the Bay. It is a safe residential area with beautiful Pacific Heights houses to admire as you stroll in the California sunshine! Some very good restaurants within walking distance too-perhaps take a cab back for the steep hills!We hope to return to the Hotel Drisco again and again, and fully endorse its well deserved No 1 rating.

<Content>Great hotel! We loved this hotel. Although the location was not central the ambience, the helpful staff and the warm welcome made up for this. There was a city cab available every morning free of charge to take us downtown and a taxi back to the hotel was very reasonable (about $10). The room were spotless and the complimentary cheese and wine in the early evening was a lovely touch. This was altogether a hotel well worth a visit and when we go back to San Francisco we will certainly use it again.

<Content>Great Neighborhood Hotel This is a repeat visit for us. Staff is exceptional, from front desk to maid service. Better location than staying in congested area with all the street people and noise. Breakfast and evening reception made it feel like we were in someone's home. Every guest we talked with felt like the Hotel Drisco was a real find. Rooms were extremely comfortable and quiet. We are coming back. E  e.

<Content>Amazing as Always The Drisco and their staff never disappoint us. This is the only hotel we stay in when we visit our old home town. After having to cancel two previous stays due to illness we were so excited to return to our home away from home. The staff was so amazing. Marti greeted us as if we were family. We really appreciate everything she did to make our stay even more special than we could have expected. The entire staff and the general manager went the distance for us. The breakfast is perfect as is the afternoon wine and cheese. What a wonderful and elegant touch. We will return as soon as we can.

<Content>As good as expected I am often nervous when there are a few bad reviews, but I can only say our stay at the Drisco was fantastic. We were allocated a large, comfortable room on the top floor (409). It had no view, but we weren't there to look out the window anyway.We were not troubled by noise, although I would guess the rooms on the ground floor or nearer the lift may be noisier. It is a simple thing to request a higher room when making your booking.The bed was very comfortable, there is an in room safe, lots of hanging space, and a large bathroom. Tea and coffee is always available downstairs, as well as apples. Complementary water is provided the first night, but not thereafter.Housekeeping was efficient and very neat, we never had to request the room to be made up (which I have had to do in more expensive hotels), despite sometimes not vacating the room until after 2pm - the staff seemed to keep track of when we were there, and worked efficiently around us. There is a large DVD selection available at reception which we made use of, but otherwise we just used reception staff for taxi bookings really as we are fairly self sufficient. I was impressed to see how the staff dealt with all the trick or treaters that turned up on Halloween night - all charm and patience which was admirable.Wireless internet in the rooms was quick and easy to utilise. The breakfast was well laid out, and definitely what I like to eat - fresh bread, bagels, pastries, 4 types of cereal, oatmeal, cheese, cold meats, hot beverages. There were also condiments available eg mustard and mayonnaise which was a nice touch. Service was quick and efficient, tables were cleared quickly (necessary on weekends when there can be a short wait for a table), but there was never a sense of being rushed.The evening wine service was a highlight, entirely due to the utterly charming wine waiter/concierge, Julio. Julio was the friendliest most helpful person we spoke with, and his recommendations for dinner and activities were all absolutely reliable. We took a ferry to Sausalito from the Ferry Building and the number 10 bus back all at his suggestion, and it was a great day out (much better than the tours from Fisherman's Wharf as well as more reasonable). Julio was also interested in places we ate at that he had not heard of, and made note of them for future guests. He really made our stay extra special.

<Content>Hit or Miss The hotel itself is beautiful with lovely grounds and fixtures. Old style but very warm and inviting. The hotel staff were friendly, however we stayed two nights and asked 4 times for a busted light to be fixed. We left with the light still not working.Service to the rooms and in reception was good.Its totally mind blowing.

<Content>A Gem Just got around to checking this site and was surprised to read acouple of the recent uncomplimentary reviews.  Our experience in late September on our first stay at the Drisco was beyond expectations. We felt the staff's warmth and friendliness from the moment we booked our reservation directly with the front desk, and later with a courtesy call to confirm our reservation 48 hours before our arrival. It must have been then that I mentioned surprise to find them full on the weekend of my birthday (in Oct.) because how else could we have been struck speechless to find ourselves in a beautiful, sunny, view room, with a split of chilled champagne and a BD card to welcome our arrival! It only got better, with the attentive, friendly service we enjoyed throughout our stay, especially from the doorman, Bob, who had also been the person who showed us to our room on arrival.  We feel fortunate to live in the wine country and to have found a new home away from home for those three or four times a year when we spend a night in the city.  Previously we have enjoyed our stays at other JV hotels in SF as well as the Aqua and Mill Valley Inn in Mill Valley, but none has felt as inviting in all aspects as this little gem tucked away in this most beautiful, quiet location in SF.

<Content>Still in Love with the Drisco My husband and I had previously stayed at the Hotel Drisco. As a result, when we were considering where to stay during our daughter's wedding weekend, which took place at the Presidio, the Drisco was our first choice. This little jewel of a hotel is reminiscent of some of the finest family run inns found in Europe, filled with lovely furnishings and designed in the style of the early 20th century. That in itself lends it a certain romanticism that is only enhanced by the meticulously groomed homes that surround it in its Pacific Heights residential neighborhood. The staff, Elizabeth and Bob, in particular, as well as the breakfast staff, literally waited on us hand and foot. For goodness sakes, it was as if we had a private staff all our own. The suite in which our daughter stayed the night before her wedding was spacious and beautiful, with more than enough room to accommodate visitors and to provide a lovely backdrop for the photographer the day of the wedding. Frequent inquiries were made of us by the hotel staff to be certain we had everything we required during our stay. Our room was also very comfortable, and by the time we were preparing to leave, we wished we had booked a few more nights, as we had settled in and felt quite at home. Breakfast, too, was more than satisfying, and the staff was quick to offer guests a latte if they desire. Wonderful authentic croissants were hard to resist, as well. Enough cannot be said to recommend the Hotel Drisco to those who seek a place to stay in San Francisco that is refined, elegant and welcoming. We plan on returning, again and again.

<Content>Disappointing Since it was this website and all of the Hotel Drisco's rave reviews which led me to book a long weekend here, I felt it was appropriate to write a review of my own. I have to say that I was disappointed and had a less than restful stay.On the positive side, the hotel staff was very friendly. The price was reasonable when compared with big downtown hotels. And although the neighborhood is a bit out of the way, it was nice to be in a non-touristy section of town. The biggest issue I encountered was noise. Every morning, I was woken up by early-rising neighbors before 6:00 am. If I managed to get back to sleep, I heard the housekeeping staff which started as early as 8:00 am and this included vacuuming rooms with the doors wide open. Also, there is virtually no insulation between rooms so if you have neighbors who like to watch television, be prepared to hear every word.I mentioned the noise problem to the front desk and asked if perhaps there was a quieter room. They informed me that I was in a quiet corner. I think they were right, comparatively speaking. Many of the hotel rooms are located in less than desirable sections of the hotel, e.g., just off the sitting room on the main floor, on the lower level near the breakfast room or directly across from the elevator. Clearly there are many people who have had enjoyable stays at this hotel. They may have stayed in better sections of the hotel or during a less busy time.

<Content>Great neighborhood hotel I absolutely loved the area where this hotel is located. We could walk everywhere. We aren't concerned with lots of hotel amenities so this worked for us. The staff were all very friendly and accomodating. The hotel does not have AC or ceiling fans so I don't know if I would stay here in the summer. I also would not stay here with children. The styling of the hotel is clean and quaint, but it is not modern.

<Content>Bad Service in parts Booked this hotel for my anniversary. Was allocated a disabled room on the ground floor, right next to the public lounge, which was most inappropriate. When I raised this with the front desk manager I was told there were no available other rooms for us to move to despite us being the very first people to check in that day, we even had to wait till a room was free.The front desk seemed only concerned with upselling us to the suite and were completely unhelpful in any other way. My wife in tears I returned to the front desk and met with the same uncooperative attitude. Eventually I agreed to pay a discount for the upgrade.The whole experience was unpleasant and much more difficult then it needed to be. I had just come from another brand new hotel in downtown San Francisco where they couldn't do enough for you. Disco felt like a big come down. Would only recommend if you must stay in Pacific Heights. Otherwise avoid this tired hotel and it's bad customer service.

<Author>FloridaWiltonManors
<Content>No to Drisco OK, I read the reviews here -- all glowing and smiles. Thought to myself, can it really be that good? After all, my beautiful wife and I were heading out to SF for our honeymoon and although I don't like the over-the-top hotel chains, I was looking for something nice. After experiencing a NASCAR type trip from the van driver thru the streets of SF, we made it and were greated warmly by Elizabeth the front desk associate. Bob (or was it Bill?) the bellman helped us with our overpacked luggage. Since we traveled most of the day to get there (we're East coast, not West), we wanted a quick bite before turning in for the night.. Bob (or is it Bill?) recommended a few places on Fillmore which more than met our needs.The next morning, we had breakfast downstairs in the dining room. A young man (name escapes me but he had a beard that needed a little help -- maybe a few more years might help) was there to assist the guests with more coffee, cleaning plates awayand generally being helpful but not intrusive.Each evening, the hotel has a wine social for an hour. It's a nice way to end the day I thought. Strange, but few guests took advantage of this social. Maybe our east coast hours made it feel later than it was? Anyway, it was a great way to end the day. And the older gentleman who was there was more than helpful -- he was entertaining as well. I never did catch his name, but ask him about his 7 week tour of America last year or his reasons for moving to the US ( he's from Central America and came here when he was 25). My wife thought he was adorable.Checking out 5 days later, both Nancy and Thahn assisted with a cordial process. So, where does the NO to Drisco come in? Simple, would I stay anywhere else if rooms are available at Drisco -- NO. Could hotel management improve customer service -- NO. Was Drisco an over-the-top hotel chain -- NO, it was truly a great experience in a wonderful neighborhood with a dedicated staff that cares about your stay. I strongly recommend the Drisco and look forward to another visit to this beautiful city where I will be staying at the Drisco.Thanks Drisco, see you in a year or two.

<Content>Unworthy policy for such a hotel!! After several emails I booked a suite at the Disco for a family of 3 adults. I had specifically asked about the pull out sofa and whether it was comfortable for an adult.On arrival, the mattress of the sofabed was a shame, It appeared to be worn out,extremely thin and uncomfortable with some iron bar sticking in your back. After having asked if something could be done about it, we got an extra blanket(lol) to cover the mattress , plus a phonecall from the front desk that we were to pay an extra 25 dollars per night for the 3rd person, because they didn't know we would be with 3!!!!!!!!!. I had the email with their confirmation of price +fact that we were a party of 3. I felt really bad.The next day Elizabeth Carr waived the 1st night, but because we got a roll-up bed ( which ruined the sittingroom)we still had to pay for 2 nights the extra 25 dollars p.n.A true 1st class hotel would have apologized for the quality of the sofabed, the fact that 1 of us had a bad 1st night and would quietly have taken care of it. I really felt let down.The room itself was spacious and nice, but the fact that it has no AC means, also in this neighbourhood, that in September you have to sleep with an open window for air and will be constantly waking up because of the noise from the street.By the way if you want to check your email it will cost you money ! Any small BB in Europe provides this service free of charge!Conclusion, the Drisco is an elegant place, but being 1 on Tripadvisor for some time has maybe made them a bit arrogant..

<Content>Lovely Small Hotel If you are looking for a hotel that is quiet and charming in an upscale neighborhood, the Hotel Drisco is it. The staff (especially Thanh) went out of their way to make my visit pleasant. Unfortunately I missed missed the evening wine reception, but the breakfast was great, along with the dining room and it's staff. The lobby living room is a nice place to sit and read with a cup of tea,coffee or an apple, which they have available at all times, along with a selection of newspapers. The hotel is not convenient to mass transportation, but the desk called a taxie for me when I needed one and it was there in just a few minutes. A nice walk will take you past fine Pacific Heights homes to shops and restaurants. I look forward to staying there again!

<Content>Hotel Drisco, First Time Visit-10-13 Oct08 Long Weekend visit to SF. A bit off the main path, the Drisco is located in very nice section of town with wonderful views.Cabs are plentiful. Say 15 min walk to Fillmore area. Parking easy on weekends but see how it could get problematic during weekdays Spacious Room was delightful with wonderful bed and beddings. HDTV a pleasant surprise. No air conditioning but was not a problem due to local climateBreakfast very nice with plenty of fresh fruit. Don't expect eggs and bacon, a very nice continental buffet Nightly wine reception was wonderful way to wind down, Staff and Service Impeccable. Will Stay again on next visit.

<Content>Wonderful! Hotel Drisco was wonderful! My boyfriend and I stayed there for 3 nights in late August, and had a great time. The location is great! You do not feel like a total tourist. Sure it is a smaller, more intimate hotel, but you feel very special staying here. Everyone at Drisco was incredibly nice and helpful; they offer excellent and sincere service.Take advantage of wine/cheese hour; it is delicious and Julio is the best host! Thanks Hotel Drisco for a fabulous stay and we will definitely return.

<Content>A second home to us When we visit San Francisco we always stay at Hotel Drisco. Unless of course it is fully booked. It is in prime real estate area that is surrounded by houses. So it is off of the beaten path. The hotel staff are great and gracious, the rooms large and well appointed. Their is a breakfast included with the price of the room that is in a quiet , lovely room. The food offered is wonderful and fresh and healthy, with the right choices. We walk or cab to all of the places that we want to go to see so it is very well situated in the city. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. We have been going there for about 12 years and have never been disappointed. Often they upgrade our room for the cost of the old room. And you can't beat that. It is the best, sort of a home away from home for us.

<Content>given Drisco's top rating I feel it's okay to be a little nit-picking on a few p My husband and I stayed at Hotel Drisco last month -Sept 08- our first visit to San Francisco. We selected the hotel largely because of its top Tripadvisor rating and excellent reviews. On the whole we were not disappointed - I would be happy to stay there again - the rooms are good, the neighbourhood very up market (a 10 minute brisk walk to shops restaurants etc.) and the hotel staff extremely pleasant and helpful. However given Drisco's current top rating on tripadvisor, which influences decisions, I feel it's okay to be a little nit-picking on a few points:Breakfast - rather disappointing - almost no fresh fruit (apart from a boring bowl of apples, bananas and oranges) Overall ambiance - the decor throughout the hotel is restrained and tasteful, and generally for an old building, it is well maintained. However it is all rather bland and hotel-like, and creates an atmosphere that is impersonal and stiff. The primness of the breakfast room for example, where very, very subdued generic orchestral music accompanies breakfast, drove the couple at the table next to ours to hold their conversation in whispers!So while Hotel Drisco serves what is probably its target market - middle-class, middle-age middle-everything - very well, it is definitely not the place for non-conformity - though in my opinion that is just what it lacks.

<Content>Great Hotel-but no A/C This hotel was absolutely lovely. The hotel staff were extremely accomodating and helpful. The continental breakfast was more than we expected--croissants, bagels, cereal, fresh fruit, dried fruit, yogart, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, juice, coffee, tea, etc. The nightly wine tasting was also exceptional with appetizers and a choice of wines. However, we were not aware that the hotel does not have A/C prior to booking the trip. It was okay since we were there when the weather was mild--however, I dont know I would necessarily stay there during the summer--especially if you are sensitve to heat.

<Content>Number one? You bet Reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, we contacted the Drisco and booked a triple room for my husband, my elderly mother and myself. Although we were kindly warned by the staff that the room was too small to comfortably accomdate three people, we were pleasantly surprised. The room was spacious, with the most comfortable beds we had ever tried, a huge bathroom, and all the possible amenities. The staff is extremely gracious and ready to help with suggestions for places to go shopping or dining, the best transportation options, and even doing the booking on your behalf. There is nothing they do not go out of their way williningly to do for their guests. I have to single out Bob, with his warm friendly attitude, big smile and exhaustive knowledge of the neighborhood and extreme kindness to my elderly mother; the well read Julio and the extremely cooperative Tan. The hotel is in a lovely picturesque neighborhood with several options for dining and shopping - even just walking up and down the streets - although steep - is a pure joy. The hotel provides a filling breakfast with plenty of options that keep you satisfied easily through lunch and also offers a wine and cheese hour by which you can easily skip lunch simply have only dinner. Coffee is available 24/7; even at 3 in the morning, you can count on freshly brewed coffee in the lobby.If you are going to Frisco, there is no other place to stay. Don't look beyond the Drisco!

<Content>Adored the Drisco Be certain to check your confirmation. When I received our confirmation, the hotel had only booked one of the two nights, then had sold out the second night and we were put on a waiting list to eventually get it all straightened out. Thank goodness because this hotel is a treat! The location is at the very top of the hills in Pacific Heights. It is a CLIMB up and down to wherever you go on foot, although we considered this a plus. The rooms are as lovely as the photos depict, although our sink was cracked in half and there are stains on the sofa and chair in sitting room. We had room 304A, which had views of the ocean, city, and neighborhood...perfect. Breakfast is more European style and plentiful. The wine and cheese hour is a highlight and we met so many other interesting guests. The service is attentive and helpful. I would think this may not be a choice for those who want to be in the thick of the tourist attractions, which is another good reason to chose this hotel. Rather, an elegant, quiet retreat. For runners, go down Broderick to the Marine front, turn right and run through Fisherman's Wharf to Bay Bridge in the early morning, or turn left and run to and across the Golden Gate Bridge. Cafe Maritime was close by and very good seafood.

<Content>Perfect Stay We, my Husband and I, stayed here from 3 to 9th September as the first stop before travelling down the PCH. We chose this hotel after reading reviews on TA and were not disappointed in any way. This was our first visit to SF and whilst the hotel may not be convenient for downtown sightseeing/shopping it is well placed for other places of interest. Also, as has been mentioned many times before, the neighbourhood in which it is located is beautiful and fun to explore (be sure to go to the bottom of Lyon Steps where you may be lucky enough, as we were, to meet a friendly native who knows much of the area and is keen to share his knowledge!). There is a towncar service to reach the downtown area so this shouldn't be too much of a problem.Check-in was efficient (Marti was so friendly) and we were made to feel at home immediately. On reaching our room, assisted by the charming Thanh (apologies if the spelling is incorrect) we discovered a bottle of champagne on ice and a lovely card congratulating us as this trip was in celebration of our 30th Wedding Anniversary - we were thrilled after a long flight and the Schramsberg was very welcome. The room was beautiful and spacious (not a suite) tastefully decorated and furnished - not at all what we would usually have chosen (modern and minimal!) and so we were surprised (pleasantly) how much we liked it. We were also delighted to have a great view from our window - not of the bay but facing in the opposite direction but still a great view and just what we had hoped for.The breakfast selection was great - same each day, fresh and nicely presented. I would only have two reservations - the toaster took an age to toast and the music, lovely thought it was (classical) was a little loud first thing in the morning. The evening wine reception was good too with nibbles and candles on the tables and a plate of snacks bought to the table by a gentleman whose name I'm afraid I don't know - he also topped up our glasses if required.Other touches like the turn-down each evening and the fresh iced water and cookies bought to the room were also welcome on our return after a hard days hill climbing!. All staff we encountered were courteous and friendly.I would love to visit here again in the future and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Hidden gem in the Heights Hotel Drisco is far enough from town to unwind after hiking the hills of San Fran but close enough to grab a cab into town which Bob the Bellman was excellent at providing! The rooms are clean and spacious with great views from the 4th floor. Breakfast was disappointing and a little more investment in great produce needed. The free cheese and wine reception in the evening is a great idea as the hotel does not have a bar and the snacks provided were lovely. We would really recommend the Drisco for its friendly staff, lovely rooms and great location in the prettiest part of town.

<Content>Could all those positive reviews be right??? You bet... We had read all the lovely reviews of this hotel and couldn't wait to stay at Hotel Drisco. After a few days in wine country, we were exhausted and got to the hotel around 6. We checked in and immediately offered warm towels. So fancy! Now this is a boutique hotel and it is in an old building. But it is so charming and nice. When you walk into the room and see the beautiful white linens on the bed and everything is clean you know you are staying at a really nice place. Michael the concierge at night was very helpful in helping us figure out where to go that night and gave us maps and called us a cab! We stayed there 2 nights and had breakfast both mornings, such a nice spread of pastrys, cereals, fruit, juice, hard boiled eggs, cheese and ham, it was fabulous! The first morning we were going to meet downtown for a tour of SF and we had a cab called. It didn't come after about 25 minutes and we were starting to cut it close to get on the bus. The concierge (I forgot her name...) talked to the driver of the towncar and without hesitation he drove us down to the pier to our tour for the same price as a cab. It was a lifesaver..we would have missed our tour!! Everyone goes out of their way to make you feel really important and welcomed. And the neighborhood. Absolutely amazing. Some of the nicest homes are in their district and although hilly, we walked around and admired these old Victorian mansions. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Fantastic boutique hotel Fantaastic boutique hotel located close to the Persido and a short distance from downtown SF and the Fisherman's Warf. Quite hotel with a very professional staff that was very anxious to please. Rooms, although small, were extremely comfortable and up to date furnishings wise. Room views were not spectacular however if you choose a room with a view you can have a beautiful view of Alcatraz Island and the Golden Gate Bridge. One great thing about the hotel is that our party of 7 arrived at different times ranging from 10:00 am till 2:00 pm we all had rooms ready for occupancy. What a great experience considering most times you have to store your luggage and hang around until a room is ready. This site served our purposes very well and a short distance to very excellent restaurants. This hotel gets a 5 star in my book.

<Content>Like coming home to a retreat Our family just completed our second stay at the Hotel Drisco and it was every bit as wonderful as we remembered it from a year ago. At the end of a long day in the city, I felt as if I was coming home to a luxurious yet relaxed retreat. The rooms are spacious, beautifully decorated and appointed, clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful, often times giving us directions, calling a taxi for us, or recommending restaurants. And the complimentary breakfast is not only fresh and healthy, it is presented in a very relaxing setting. I plan to return to the Hotel Drisco whenever I'm in San Francisco and wouldn't hesitate recommending it as a place for others to stay.

<Content>Why so highly rated?? After reading all the stellar reviews, my wife and I were thrilled we found a room at the Drisco on short notice for a couple of nights in August. We were on vacation in the bay area looking for a nice place to stay in San Fran before we headed to Sonoma for a few days.We've stayed in several very good SF hotels in the past, and based on the high tripadvisor rating I guess we were expecting a lot, but this hotel was a BIG dissapointment. It was OK at best.Very helpful doorman (not so much for the snooty front desk guy... seemed like new part-time staff). Rooms a bit cramped and LOTS of noise from creaking pipes, floorboards, and adjacent rooms. Also very cold since our in room radiator didn't seem to work despite someone coming to fix it... had to call for an extra electric heater. Mind you we had a discounted rate and probably got a poor room as a result(??). Breakfast was included and although we had trouble finding a seat, the meal was very good.Bottom line is that this is an older property in a very residential neighborhood without a lot of amenities. Decent lodging for the price, but my wife and I can't comprehend why it ranks so highly. We're a bit baffled.We didn't stay here the next weekend on our way home and we will not stay here when we return to SF in the spring. Again, not a bad hotel, but it simply doesn't seem to fit a top pick for SF, a city with so many fabulous hotels. We're thinking maybe top 100 would be more accurate. I can't emphasize enough how confused we are by the high ratings this property receives.

<Content>It's a wonderful world I have family living in the Presidio, and they booked our room at the Drisco, one of two Joie de Vivre hotels in the area where we stayed. Both were very nice, but the Drisco was like a large, comfortable, well maintained home. The setting is residential, and gorgeous, and the ambiance was just wonderful. I will look for reasons to return and stay here again.

<Content>Loved the Drisco We just returned from a four night stay at this lovely boutique hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed staying in the Pacific Heights area, amongst mansions and away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Street parking was readily available - much better than paying the astronomical parking rates at the downtown hotels.The staff was very friendly, helpful, and responsive to all of our requests.Our family had three rooms - two of the rooms were on the lower level and worked well for our adult children and their toddlers. Their rooms were quite large. Our only caveat is to avoid Room 109. We were given that room, which was very large, but it turned out to be too noisy for us since it was off of the main hall, very close to reception, and we were kept awake by conversations of lots of people returning to the hotel in the late late evening. The following morning, we requested a change of room to a quieter location. This request was accommodated quickly and pleasantly. Our luggage was moved to the new room for us. We loved the second room, even though it was smaller than our original room. The beds were very comfortable, and the rooms nicely laid out - with lots of mirrors and good lighting. The expanded continental breakfast was excellent. It included oatmeal, cold cuts, cheeses, pastries, breads, and fresh orange juice. The coffee was excellent.In the evening, wine was available in the dining room. We were only able to take advantage of this on one evening, but we found that the wines served were very good.We highly recommend this boutique hotel, and will stay here again the next time that we decide to stay in San Francisco.

<Content>Elegance with quality service in a wonderful locale We recently enjoyed 3 nights in a suite at Hotel Drisco in San Francisco. A wonderful all round experience with a quiet boutique hotel with traditional friendly services and quality rooms and amenities. Located in Pacific Heights an exclusive upmarket quiet inner suburban locale with all facilities as required and first class self service buffet breakfast..We found the staff courteous friendly and prepared to go the extra mile to assist. The ability to ride their town car limo service into the CBD each morning was a real plus.We were initially concerned as to no undercover parking, but there was plenty of readily available street parking and the staff moved the car as needed during the day. Access to the city was very easy and taxi fare cost $10.00 approx. to downtown.We travel widely in USA and Europe staying at a mix of 5 star hotels and suites. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Drisco and will return on future visits and are pleased to provide this summary and recommendation.It is not the marble and glitz of some of the major chains but it is high quality personal service in a boutique hotel in an enjoyable location slightly out of the central business district.

<Content>The BEST boutique hotel ever! Just returned from the most wonderful week vacation in SF, where we stayed at this hotel. Where to start--first, this is a first-rate small boutique hotel, located in the most beautiful and safe section of SF-Pacific Heights. We walked everywhere--and if walking up and down hills is too difficult, the Muni bus system is fantastic, inexpensive, and easily accessible. NO NEED for cabs ever, unless you have difficulty walking downhill to bus. If so, one can be gotten very easily by hotel---and I recommend you book their town car to  from airport. It is a flat rate and a 30 minute drive. Our room was beautifully appointed, w/the most delicious smelling lotions, etc. Every employee was exceptionally polite and attentive w/o being pretentious. Bob, the Doorman, guided us to the most exquisuite mansions in our area, and greeted us upon our daily returns--very impressed with our lengthy walks throughout SF. The Concierges took care of all our needs and offered recommendations, including personalized guides as desired. Julio, the evening wine and cheese server, was most wonderul. He always suggested the excellent dinner spots, refilled our glasses, offered hot appetizers, and on our last day, served some of the most delicious mango cheddar cheese imagined--with a great story behind it. Romeo served our morning cappacino's just the way I liked it--skim milk in a tall cup and refilled it with most graciously after my husband spilled it! The morning buffet is delicious. Once, when we needed some attention to a bathroom appliance, w/i seconds, someone appeared and was fully gracious and accommodating. The housekeeping staff served fresh ice cubes and cookies each evening. Do we ever miss this place--and San Francisco!! Trust me when I say this is THE place--and I am a difficult person to please hotel-wise. Also, we recommend the Slanted Door Vietnamese restaurant in the Ferry Building. Go early--hungry--you will be glad you did! We also adored Ploof, in the Beldin Alley in the Financial District--very Parisian with fabulous mussels. Lupa in the Noe Valley and A16 on Chestnut were wonderful Italian restaurants. Nothing was too expensive. Plus there are literally hundreds of tiny gems around the city to eat at--and we did our share. Loved Union, Sacramento, and Upper Fillmore for shopping. The upper Fillmore was our favorite nightspot as well--a very happening place and we enjoyed an inexpensive drink at Grove many an evening. Reminds us of our favorite SoHo neighborhood lounge. Walk over Russian Hill-soooo gorgeous--walk Macaundry Alley between Union and Green on Jones--indescribable. Of course there is Golden Gate, the Embarcadero, the Mission, SOMA, Fisherman's Wharf, etc. Warning--you absolutely NEED advance tix to Alcatraz! Take a ferry to Sausalito! Okay, I am done--I will be back, and yes, we will 100% stay at the Hotel Drisco!

<Content>Just OK My husband and I just returned from a quick overnight at the Hotel Drisco and were pretty disappointed. The raves the hotel received led us to believe we were in for a treat. Here's our recap:On the plus side: there was avery friendly bellman, it's a quiet neighborhood in a central location, there were comfy beds and a nice continental breakfast.But be warned this is a much older, conservative crowd (im in my 20s and my husband is in his 30s) We were in the basement and the noise didn't stop all day, plus the mornings were a drag with everyone coming down for breakfast. Also, our room was TINY. I believe we were in a deluxe queen and it was really small. Maybe you have a better time at this hotel if you are a business traveler or an older couple with a really great suite. But we were pretty disappointed.

<Content>Perfect Stay at the Drisco We stayed at the Hotel Drisco for 4 nights in late June 2008 as part of a 2 week tour of New York, San Francisco  Vegas. It was without doubt one of the finest hotels we've ever stayed at - it is located in a beautiful neighbourhood surrounded by amazing houses that would put Beverley Hills to shame !The hotel itself is a boutique style and this works wonderfully in it's favour - far too many chain hotels treat you as a number. At the Drisco the personal touch offered by the staff made us feel at home from the moment we walked through the door.A special mention must go to Bob, the concierge and general San Francisco expert, who greeted us like long lost friends and gave us a guided tour of the amenities of the hotel when we arrived. He was excellent in recommending restaurants, and also suggested suitable walks of the local area to ensure we got the very best out of our stay.The rooms were very nice and were very luxuriously furnished (we wanted to bring the extremely comfortable bed back to the UK with us!!)Location wise you are about a 10 minute walk from Fillmore street where there are lots of nice places to eat and drink as well as some unusual but interesting shops. A little bit further along is the California street cable car stop where you can easily get around the city (it's also cool hanging onto the side of the cable cars and surfing the streets of San Francisco !!)Back to the hotel.... There is a lovely sitting room where complimentary fresh tea and coffee is available throughout the day and night and offers a nice informal environment in which to chat to some of your fellow guests (hello to the Floridatravellers!)The hotel also offers a complimentary wine reception each evening - although sadly, we didn't get the opportunity to sample this as we were so busy out exploring the sights of San Francisco!!In summary a great hotel, in a lovely location with staff that will really go the extra mile to make everything perfect !! We will definitely be returning.

<Content>Hotel Drisco is "World Class" It doesn't get better than this! The Hotel Drisco is located in Pacific Heights with views that are breath-taking. My three children were with me (ages 28, 26  12)  they agreed that the Hotel Drisco is the nicest hotel they've stayed in worldwide. The staff is at your beckon call! We will return to only the Hotel Drisco whenever we are in San Francisco.

<Content>The Best Accommodation  From the initial phonecall to the final farewell, my every experience with this property and the staff was exceptional. Elegantly and tastefully decorated, without being over the top, the rooms were very comfortable. There were many thoughtful extras - bathrobes and slippers, daily newspaper, jug of iced water, bed turned down daily - all complimentary. The communal sitting room was a very pleasant and relaxing place to spend time - with newspapers, water, tea and coffee supplied, again complimentary. Hotel Drisco is located in a lovely area, with easy access to downtown San Francisco.Breakfast choices were varied, and the food was delicious.The service was discreet and unobtrusive. Staff were thoughtful, considerate, and exemplary in their service and knowledge. It was a personal, friendly, warm, environment, where one felt genuinely welcomed and cared for. In fact, whilst the Hotel Drisco building and location cannot be faulted, it is the staff that distinguishes this lovely property from others (and I'd particularly like to acknowledge Bob and Marti). I wouldn't choose anywhere else, ever, to stay in San Francisco.

<Content>Great Hotel We recently visited the US for our honeymoon and stayed at the Hotel Drisco and I really can't fault this hotel in any way. The staff were lovely, helpful and friendly. The room was fantastic and they even put a complimentary bottle of wine in our room as a gift for our honeymoon (nice touch). We had an extra night in San Fransico at the end of our trip so rebooked at this hotel. The second room was again lovely, however the walls were a little thin, but to be honest it didn't bother us at all and I can't speak highly enough about this hotel. Every morning there was a complimentary basic breakfast (which was everything we wanted, cereal, pastries, coffee, tea, juice, toast etc) in the sitting room and in the evenings they had complimentary wine and cheese, and it was good! The Hotel itself is situated in Pacific Heights which in my opinion is nicest area of San Fransico but it is a $5-$10 taxi ride from Fishermans Wharf etc - however the hotel is in walking distance of some awesome resteraunts  the area is very safe and and is really a tourist attraction itself. The Hotel will also organise for Resteraunt delivery if you require it. On the last day, they arranged for late check out because we didn't have to go to the airport until later, they also arranged a town car to pick us up and whilst we were waiting for the town car we sat in the waiting area.... Which was fully equiped with biscuits, newpapers, tea, coffee and some really comfortable chairs. To sum up - Thank you for being so wonderful, I can not reccommend this hotel enough  to be honest if it is available your crazy if you don't book it. Out of all the hotels in America it was our favourite.

<Content>A wonderful experience! A friend recommended the Hotel Drisco to us during our stay in San Francisco. We could not have been happier with our accommodations. From the moment we checked in to our departure four days later, we were impressed with the service. From the suggestions of local restaurants to directions to various sights, the staff was extremely helpful. Bob at the front desk went above and beyond in making sure our stay was enjoyable. Not only was the location of the hotel wonderful, but all the extra amenities added to the pleasure of our stay. The Hotel Drisco is a place we would highly recommend to our family and friends, and we will definitely be returning soon. Dennis and Trish Rodrigues, Cooper City, Florida

<Content>What a Nice Hotel! Over from the the UK for a wedding. Large room with lovely view over the city. Away from the racket of downtown but within easy bus or taxi range. Local shops and restaurants about 15 mins walk away. Staff extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Had a great time.

<Content>Wonderful hotel with superb service and fabulous location This is a wonderful place to stay in San Francisco. Pacific Heights is a beautiful area, very safe and it's an experience just to walk around and see the amazing homes.It is a fair distance from the main tourist sights but we loved walking around, even with the steep hills! We were very glad not to be staying in downtown and to retire to our lovely neighbourhood.From the moment we arrived, the staff could not do enough. Our room was prepared early. We were very happy to be upgraded to a suite as it was our honeymoon and on our first night the bed had been decorated with petals - a nice touch.There are plenty of parking spaces around. There are signs saying it is three hour parking but the staff were more than happy to take our keys and move the car if needs be.The breakfast is perfectly adequate. The room we stayed in was tasteful and classic in its design as was the rest of the hotel that we saw. Hard to find any fault with this hotel.

<Content>Hidden Gem in Pacific Heights!! We just returned from a 4 day visit in San Francisco, for our anniversary and enjoyed our stay at Hotel Drisco immensely!! It's a small but charming hotel in posh Pacific Heights, that's elegant, quiet, comfortable and reasonable. We chose HD based on TripAdvisor  Frommer guide reviews, booked directly with the hotel, got 4-star amenities: robes, slippers, LAVISH products, friendly, professional staff  conciege, daily paper, turndown service, daily breakfast  evening wine reception. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but they have limited room service(delicious paninni sandwiches) and an Order In service with decent selection, prices for the one night we stayed in. Local dining, shopping and buses are just walking distance away. And if we needed take a cab, a quick call to front desk and we had one within 5-10min! The hotel has a town car service, which provides transportation to  from the airport (fee added) AND complimentary daily service to downtown from 7:30-9:30am, M-F. Otherwise, parking is hard to find. (Not a problem, as we did not drive!) Beds are very comfy, decor is elegant, understated vintage. We had corner room, 406B, deluxe king and slept well every night, it was so quiet! The hotel provides several handy guides for walking tours, shopping, dining tips, which we used and staff's recommendations for local eateres: Ella's, Crepevine, Osteria Forno were excellent. We will definitely stay at Hotel Drisco again and highly recommend it for anyone seeking a tasteful, friendly, reasonable change of pace from typical chain hotels in San Francisco!

<Content>Beyond our Expectations-Hotel Drisco My wife and I have lived in California for forty years and have stayed in many different Hotels in San Francisco during that time. We wanted a special place in San Francisco to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary . We found it at Hotel Drisco, a smaller hotel located in the beautiful Pacific Heights section of San Francisco. Do not let small fool you. This is a Hotel run , at all levels, by people who care about your stay with them. The Hotel has a very comforting and welcoming sense of elegance and sophistication. All the employees were hospitable, warm, friendly, and helpful with restaurant recommendations, restaurant reservations, parking, directions, luggage, and room accomodations .HOTEL DRISCO will be our home away from home when in San Fransisco. Can't wait!

<Content>Wonderful! This one is not to be missed! Everything about this hotel is wonderful. The decor, the bedding, the staff, all amazing.It's in one of the nicest neighborhoods in SFO, and is just a ten minute bus ride from everything. I know, I don't usually ride buses either, but in SFO they're great.The restaurant recommendations were perfect, and within walking distance of the hotel.If you're going to be in SFO, you owe it to yourself to try the Drisco.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Drisco I recently stayed at the hotel for 3 nights arriving after a 13 hour flight from Australia.I found the service to be top notch at this hotel with lovely friendly staff. Marti and Bobby and Elizabeth are a credit to the hotel. I liked the room and loved the posh Pacific Heights area. As a single woman travelling alone this is a very safe great area handy [by car or short cab] to Marina restaurants, the restaurants and cafes of Union Street and the restaurants on Fillmore Street. The one thing I have to mention is that you really need a car if you are staying at this hotel [or be prepared to catch cabs] as there are no shops or restaurants within an easy walk and the hotel is in a very hilly area. However parking is easy and plentiful on the street so it is no problem hiring a car and parking near the hotel. I just hired a car and was perfectly happy at the Drisco.I am a light sleeper and was able to sleep easily in this hotel. From time to time I would be conscious of a slight noise but it did not affect my sleep. Also I had no problem whatsoever with the water temperature in the shower - it was great. I had always intended to move to a hotel in the San Francisco CBD after 3 nights here as I had things to do in the city. I really enjoyed the Drisco and would recommend it to my friends with the proviso that they hire a car to get around which, to be honest, you should be doing in San Francisco anyway to really see everything e.g. Parks, driving across Golden Gate Bridge etc.

<Content>Fabulous European Style Hotel in San Francisco European visitors, or US travelers who have been to Europe will feel right at home in San Francisco's Hotel Drisco; this hotel has a real European feel to it, from the delightfully vintage hardwood floors in the lobby, to the bountiful (and included) breakfast buffet. My partner and I booked two nights at the Drisco for a quick break over the Memorial Day weekend, and completely enjoyed our stay. The room was small (again, think hotels in Paris or London) but well appointed and the bathroom was pretty and clean with some additional amenities that I wish every hotel would offer, such as a toothbrush and toothpaste for purchase if you forgot yours, and some bath salts and shaving kits. The staff from bell hop to front desk was unfailingly nice and polite which made staying here a real pleasure; additionally the hotel adds some choice extras such as a complimentary wine and cheese reception from 5-7PM, which was very pleasant. They also have a very small gym which though small, has well maintained machines. The only reason I could suggest for passing on this hotel would be if you had never visited San Francisco before and had a very limited amount of time there (for example 24-48 hours) and that is only because of the location, which is not close to any major tourist attractions (Fisherman's Wharf for example) though it is somewhat close to the Palace of Fine Arts. My partner and I found plenty to do close by and were able to take a quick cab ride to Golden Gate Park for a trip to the De Young Museum. Other then that, this is just a wonderful hotel all around.

<Content>Bring on the heat wave - Hotel Drisco does not disappoint! The last 3 nights of our anniversary trip were spent at the delightful Hotel Drisco. The neighborhood of Pacific Heights is lovely  I cannot say enough about the wonderful, accomodating staff at this hotel.  Everyone was friendly, while remaining very professional. Some of the people who really went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable were: Elizabeth, at the front desk, who provided great dining recommendations, a complimentary brochure for a self-tour of Pacific Heights  many other helps to us, the concierge, Marti who is one of the most gracious people I've ever encountered working in the industry  who gave us some great suggestions (we loved Fillmore St, Marti  the great shops  restaurants!),  two bellmen, the day person, who was a very industrious, ever-present man whose name escapes me (he is an Asian man, smaller in stature)  who seemed to anticipate our every need both with luggage  parking. Also, Bobby, the evening person, who was a beam of sunshine whenever we saw him  so helpful. The housekeeping staff should be commended for their excellent attention to detail  thank you especially to whoever made up our room for our arrival. It was so welcoming! There was the bottle of sparkling wine on ice (which was rather melted due to our very late arrival!), a bucket of ice (again which had melted, however, it was very thoughtful  was promptly refilled when we checked in by the gentleman helping us with our luggage), the robes laid out on the bed  slippers on the floor, the welcome card.  a dish of fresh fruit which was refreshed daily. What a great introduction!The staff that attended the dining room for breakfast  the wine/cheese hour are equally to be commended; we'd especially like to recognize the man who worked the evenings we were there who really went out of his way to provide for us. Even though we'd arrive a bit close to 7 pm, he always made certain we had what we needed  we never felt rushed. Also the breakfast selections we thought excellent contrary to a previous post - there were hot  cold cereals, all types of breads including french bread, yogurt, cottage cheese, hard cooked eggs, yummy ham, turkey, two types of cheese (I enjoy this type of European fare for breakfast), an assortment of fresh fruit, juices, milk, coffee, pastries, etc. - more than adequate!We stayed in a 2 room suite which was spacious, with great city views  loved being able to open the windows; street noise was minimal to non-existant! A fan was provided upon request  we had great air circulation  it seriously did not feel that it was as hot as it was (100 degrees on 5/15!). Nighttime it cooled off considerably; we actually felt a bit chilly when we walked to dinner that night ~ 8:30 pm with the breeze. Thank you, Elizabeth for the dining recommendations - we really enjoyed both Osteria  Cafe Maritime.Ok, now just a brief note about what detracted from our stay a bit. When I made our reservation back in December 2007, I had specifically requested an upper level room in a quiet area because I am a very light sleeper. I know that they did try to fulfill the quiet area request  that our arrival was late (we did call ahead to let them know), but we were placed in a suite on the second floor (the hotel is 4 floors). I asked the desk person when we checked in (I think it was ~ 10:30 pm) if we could be on a higher level  he was rather dismissive  curt, stating that there were no other rooms available  the hotel was full. I was perturbed, because with our two other accomodations for this trip, we were assigned to a specific room ahead of time so I was assured that there was no one above us. Before 6 am the next morning, the noise started above us (we'd gone to sleep after midnight)  I later learned that the people had checked out that day. I realize that they needed to get ready to leave, but I could not go back to sleep as noise continued for a couple of hours. Elizabeth kindly had us moved to the room above us later that day (third floor), but there was still nothing available on the fourth floor. After going to sleep that night about midnight, I was awoken during the night for about 30 minutes to an hour with what sounded like people moving furniture around above us; when it stopped, I was able to go back to sleep with no further incidents. I guess my point is - an earlier review had stated that they were assigned to room 406 A (a suite). Knowing my requests from 5 months prior, it seemed to me that we should have been assigned to a similar higher level room. Although the hotel was a favorite for me on this trip, sleeping was the most difficult for me here. Also, we did have to call to the front desk as there was someone (staff or guest) smoking in the courtyard  the smell of cigarette smoke wafted up through our windows into our room. After speaking with Bob or Bobby, the problem was resolved.My husband wished there was a fan in the bathroom to combat moisture  I wished for softer toilet paper (ok, so I'm a fan of Charmin!), but other than that  the aforementioned overhead noise, we were very happy here  would gladly stay here again  recommend this hotel to our family  friends!

<Content>Drisco has unbeatable service I found almost everything about the Hotel Drisco excellent. It will become my hotel-of-choice in San Francisco. (I usually stay at the Mandarin Oriental.) I was wary about the lack of parking but had no trouble finding a spot on the street whenever I needed it. I'm writing this review (my first ever) to let people know about the wonderful service I received: When I got home, I realized I had forgotten my travel alarm clock on the bedside table. I immediately called, the clock was located, and two days later it arrived by priority mail. Little things and big things---the Hotel Drisco has it all.

<Content>as described The hotel is as described on this site. I got a less expensive room at a good rate so the room size and location reflected that. I don't think it's the best hotel in San Francisco, but it did meet my needs for location and price. My daughter and I noticed there were several mother/daughters at breakfast so it is a comfortable hotel for women traveling alone. My only complaint would be that I forgot to print directions and when I called the hotel for directions the person answering the phone couldn't help me because the route from Los Angeles wasn't familiar to her. Most hotels have printed directions from various routes for the people answering the phone to read aloud to drivers.

<Content>Charming and Peaceful SF Retreat Stayed here last weekend for my husband's birthday. I was eager to check this place out given the very high ratings on TripAdvisor. Overall, Hotel Drisco did not disappoint. It has old world elegance minus the stuffiness found in some old world hotels. The staff was extremely accomodating and pleasant without seeming overbearing. The location is lovely...on a very quiet, upscale street in Pacific Heights. Our bed was very comfy, sheets soft. Like other previous reviewers, we were stunned at the fact that we were not once awoken by street noise. Honestly, it felt as if we were staying at a hotel in the countryside rather than in the middle of SF. It was that quiet!While this was a lovely hotel...I wouldn't rank it as one of the top places I've ever stayed. * I tend to prefer more modern decor and a slightly more casual environment. * I also like to know if I happen to be hungry after hours, I can get food delivered to my room instead of prowling the streets looking for a late-night takeout joint. * Our morning shower was unfortunately tepid which does tend to put a negative spin on the day (at least for me). * And I can't say I was that blown away by the continental breakfast--yes, it was good but I personally didn't find it to be anything out of the ordinary (aside from the delicious fresh squeezed OJ).That said, I most certainly would stay here again and we will be recommending this hotel to my in-laws who travel out twice a year from Ireland to visit. I imagine this hotel would most appeal to Europeans and older folks...or anyone craving a peaceful haven in the middle of a very busy city.

<Content>Wonderful hotel My husband and I just returned from a stay at the Hotel Drisco in San Francisco. We absolutely loved this hotel! We made our reservation months in advance and were thrilled to receive such amazing service and attention even prior to our arrival. Elizabeth at the front desk generously answered many e-mails with wonderful advice as to car rental, restaurants, and area attractions. Bob gracefully handled the front door greeting duties, welcoming us by name when we arrived. Our room was perfect. Room 406A! It was a two-room suite that had to be about 800 sq. feet. With the high ceilings, plentiful windows on two sides of the room, two flat screen TV鈥檚 (one in the living room and one in the bedroom), very comfortable bed, and full amenities, we were most content. This particular room is reached by entering through a door into a private hallway. It was a very quiet room, something that is very important to us when we travel. In fact, we never heard another guest while in our lovely room. The furniture and draperies are simple and nice (not luxurious, but quite cheery and pleasant) and the rooms were immaculately clean. We thought the bathroom was beautiful. For a property as old as this one is, it was impeccably maintained. We enjoyed the little touches such as robes and slippers set out at turndown service along with cookies, bottled water, and the next day鈥檚 weather report. We also liked the 24-hour coffee and tea available in the hotel鈥檚 sitting room as we were able to take coffee to go when we set out to explore each day. It was a little warm our first night, though with the windows open and the fan the hotel provided, we had a most comfortable first night鈥檚 rest.As room 406A is on the back left side of the property (which sat upon a very steep hill-it is San Francisco, after all), it felt like we were much higher up from ground level, providing unobstructed views of the city. If we peered out the living room windows and looked to the left, we could see the San Francisco Bay. We loved the spaciousness, peacefulness, and privacy this room provided. And the walks around the neighborhood (the expensive Pacific Heights neighborhood) were spectacular. In a simple mile-loop (the hotel provides a map), one can walk past mansions worth tens of millions of dollars. So not only can one gaze upon the beautiful San Francisco Bay on this stroll, but you can gape at the beauty of neighborhood dwellings. The Presidio park is also a block from the hotel, providing easy access to walks in the forest. We loved being able to park within a block of the hotel for free and access our vehicle whenever we wished. We also enjoyed the peaceful of this property versus staying within the craziness and congestion of San Francisco proper. Visits to most San Francisco sights were only a 10-minute drive. We would imagine some of the rooms whose windows looked out over the front entrance of the hotel might be exposed to the conversational noise of passing pedestrians or lingering hotel guests, but I suspect it is not a significant problem as it really is a quiet neighborhood with little street traffic. Breakfast is free every morning in the sunny and bright dining room with several copies of The San Francisco Chronicle, NY Times, and Wall Street Journal available to read. Breakfast is buffet-style with croissants, scones, cereal, toast, bagels, oatmeal, and fruit. Breakfast can also be delivered in your room at no extra charge. The service at breakfast as in the rest of the hotel was perfection. The staff was kinder than that at The Four Seasons properties at which we usually stay when we travel. When we visit San Francisco again, we will definitely stay here again for the personal attention of the staff, the privacy, the cleanliness of the property, the peace and quiet, and well, the 鈥渂ang for the buck.鈥?It was a positively fantastic value considering the level of service and lovely accommodations we received. We enjoy perfection when we travel and we found it here.

<Content>Service Plus! My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Drisco Apr 18 - 21, 2008. Before booking over the phone, we reviewed local hotels extensively. Priorities to us were value, tranquility, and personalized service. The hotel excelled in all. From the moment we arrived, hospitality plus was extended. We were able to check in early, and were given advice where to eat in the neighbourhood. Marti, concierge extraordinaire, suggested that we shop in the Union Street area after lunch. We did, had an extraordinary time with retailers who went the extra mile, and fell in love with Pacific Heights.While our room did not have an ocean or street view, we had two large sets of windows, one of which opened onto an inner courtyard filled with tropical plants. Our room was very quiet and large with a sitting area. Our suite was conveniently located down the hall from the dining room. We visited it two times daily for the wine tasting and incredible breakfasts. Julio and Omar, serving staff, went out of their ways to welcome us and make us feel like family. For example, after our a.m. arrival, Omar stopped me in the hall to ask if I would like some pastries with my coffee which I had been invited to take from the salon area on the main floor. Now that's service!Marti, the Concierge who took our phone reservation, remembered that our trip was in honour of my husband's birthday. After returning to our suite the first day, we found a 1/2 bottle of sparkling California wine chilling in a cooler of ice and a gracious note wishing my husband many happy returns from the Staff. How is that for attention to detail!The front office staff always had the time and interest to listen to our escapades when we returned from our daily explorations of SFO on foot. There was nothing they couldn't do for us. For example, when we came back on our last day and recounted our adventures to Bob the Bellhop/front desk staff yet mentioned we had not seen the Haight area, he quickly consulted the Internet and advised us which bus we could hop on a block away for the Haight.If you are interested in an upscale European-style pension, this is the place for you. With 100 years of history to the building, expect some idiosyncracies like steam boilers banging when the heat comes on at night or in the morning. I think my innards would be screaming a bit too at that age!

<Content>Wonderful Pacific Heights Gem We stayed at the Hotel Drisco (sadly, only for one night)... for our friends' wedding.. We easily found a parking spot outside when we arrived (before check-in time)... which is so rare in San Francisco... were greeted with hot towels, and quickly shown to our room. The room was beautiful, with a small separate sitting area. Light filled the space and bounced off the crisp white linens as we entered the bedroom . We only had a few minutes to spend in the room before heading off to the wedding, but when we returned, the bed had been turned down, and light jazz was playing softly from the bedside alarm clock radio. There were also a couple of cookies and a little card on the tv table, indicating the weather for the next day so that we could be prepared (it was unseasonably warm, but beautiful)... which I thought was a nice touch. The bathroom was small, but efficient, and the rug was super plush. There was also a bathroom amenity basket filled with many thoughtful items for sale, which can be a life saver for some guests, I'm sure! The actual bathroom amenities were wonderful, as well- it's nice to get something other than Gilchrist  Soames for a change! The only ding I have to give this property is one that many people already know and accept about staying in older, boutique hotels- you can hear EVERYTHING that's going on in your neighbors room- above and to the side-... In the evening luckily, we were so tired, we only noticed it right before nodding off to sleep, but in the morning, were awakened in the morning by a previously set alarm clock (5:45am) , and the guests next door to us using a hair dryer. We did partake in the complimentary breakfast, but opted to dine in our room, since we had the sitting area- it was great. The food was simple, but hit the spot. The dining room area was spacious, and filled with light, people were quietly reading the newspaper or having their morning coffee- it was very mellow.  I can't say enough about this neighborhood, it's so nice to stay in San Francisco, and not have to deal with the crowds, haggling for a cab, or waiting for a valet to bring your car- we checked out, leisurely walked to our car, and agreed that we'd return very soon!

<Content>Quiet and Comfy B  I will definitely return for a variety of good reasons - location, quiet, it's comfortable, and has amazing linens. Honestly, I felt this hotel met my needs better than the glitzy hotels downtown. A few things I'd say - I did not receive the phone call everyone mentions. Also, as a loyalty club member, I was supposed to receive a half bottle of wine. I asked about it, but it never appeared and I got the sense that I had been inappropriate by asking for it. The breakfast was very nice indeed with a friendly young man in charge. The wine was a nice quality but when I was there, they served only one kind of cheese and one kind of cracker and a small bowl of mixed olives - nice, but not special - the man that evening didn't offer a smile or welcome. I felt the staff was pleasant but didn't experience anything remarkable. Arequest for a wakeup call was met warmly. However, I stood at the front desk for more than 5 minutes very early in the morning while the gentleman on duty had a chit chat with a woman on the phone (didn't sound like hotel business) and gave up - I had wanted to know where coffee could be found. Otherwise, I didn't ask for much and perhaps if I had, I could report more strongly on their customer service. In the room, it would be great to have a tv channel guide as well as prices for the items in the honor bar. I paid $369/night, so I can't call it a bargain but it was reasonable. All in all, I look forward to returning and perhaps I will move to a 5. Definitely worth staying so please don't misread my comments as something that should dissuade a stay. As I said, I'll go back.

<Content>Absolutely Loved Hotel Drisco! We had a lovely stay at the Hotel Drisco and felt at home the minute my husband and two children (14 and 12 years old) walked in the front door . We were offered hot towels to refresh ourselves after our long drive. The front desk staff was very nice, especially Marti, who gave us many ideas. Our suite was sun drenched and spotless and very nicely decorated. We were all thrilled. We couldn't have asked for a better breakfast! I loved the location in the very beautiful neighborhood and there were wonderful places to eat within walking distance. We are looking forward to returning to Hotel Drisco!

<Content>A great hotel My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Drisco on the first part of our honeymoon and we found the hotel excellent. The room felt modern and was made up to a very high standard. The hotel is set in a very quiet (and obviously very expensive) part of San Francisco and it is quick, easy and cheap to get into the centre of the city using the numerous public Muni buses that depart from a couple of blocks away.The little extras are what set the hotel apart. Every morning we had a complimentary paper hanging from our door. There was free DSL internet access in every room. The breakfasts were delicious with freshly pressed orange juice. The complimentary wine and cheese between 5pm and 7pm every evening was excellent and gave us the opportunity to question the hosts about what we should be doing and seeing.We really enjoyed our time is Hotel Drisco, thanks

<Content>Lovely Hotel Set in the beautiful Pacific Heights area, this hotel is quiet, clean, lovely, and the customer service is over the top. Hot towels on arrival, doormen that will help with ANYTHING, dinner reservations, you name it. Our room had a flat screen TV and free wireless Internet. The bedding and towels were luscious and the bathroom was large. Breakfast is cold but they do have boiled eggs and oatmeal, and it's complimentary. I thought the price was very fair for the location, service, and additions, like breakfast and Internet. Parking is on the street but its not bad. I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>First rate My wife and I are currently staying at the Drisco and thoroughly enjoying it. The hotel is early 1900s elegant, and is located in one of the poshest areas in SF high up in the desirable hill section. The mansion built by the Folgers of coffee fame is next store. President Hoover's home is a block or so away. There is a bit of a BB feel to the hotel, with an attentive staff, a wine gathering in the early evening, and a very good continental breakfast (European style: meats, cheeses, fresh and dried fruits, cereal, yogurt, fresh squeezed orange juice, rolls, etc.). Assorted celebrities ranging from President Eisenhower to Ashley Judd have stayed here. The location is a bit far from downtown (10 to 15 minutes by taxi), but the hotel has a free car service downtown each morning. Moreover, the residential local makes for a quiet and relaxed feeling. We even slept with our windows open last night. The view from those windows is the skyline of downtown SF. There is no dedicated parking, but parking nearby on the street has not proven to be an issue so far. There is also no restaurant or bar, so apart from the breakfast, the only food available on site are grilled sandwiches. The room is reasonably sized and very nicely appointed. There is no A/C, but that is seldom an issue in SF. The heat also cannot be controlled (other than on/off in individual rooms), and it did seem a bit warm (solved by opening the window). Everything is exceptionally clean. If what you want is a glitzy edifice and lobby downtown in the middle of everything with every service possible available 24/7, then the Drisco might not be for you. But for a quiet and accommodating island in a busy metropolis, the Drisco can't be beat, and, especially for a several day stay, it is way less expensive than its glitzy, impersonal competitors.

<Content>Real San Francisco Experience This was our second visit to San Francisco within a year having enjoyed it so much first time around. Rather than the conventional chain hotels we decided to try something a little different and the Hotel Drisco couldn't have been better. Located away from the City Centre but in a lovely neighbourhood , Pacific Heights, you couldn't get more San Francisco. Yes it is a little hilly but that really is part of the charm of it all. It is only two blocks from a bus service downtown which is a fun ride in itself. Lovely room, warm welcomes all round and very nice extra little touches. A very good free breakfast and free glass of wine early evening served by Julio who was most charming. Normally we like to change things every time but next visit we will go back to the Hotel Drisco.

<Content>Superb Experience! I arrived midday during a business trip and needed to get some work done and found myself in a beautiful room with all the amenities to make my office time great. Sunny, spacious, and supremely comfortable. Fantastic, gracious staff...very personal...almost felt like I was staying in a private inn or BB. Wonderful neighborhood. This hotel entirely changed my view (literally and figuratively) of SF, as I'd only stayed in downtown hotels on past visits.I'd recommend to colleagues, family or friends (and already have!). I will definitely visit again when returning to SF.

<Content>The Hotel Drisco..An Elegant Experience If incredible service and the elegance of a beautifully restored older hotel are important to you in your travels you will never find a better place than the Hotel Drisco. The rooms are comfortably furnished...the area is quiet for those of us who don't want to hear traffic noise and the breakfast was a nice plus...the rates are reasonable...but most importantly the staff is at your beck and call from the moment that you walk thru the front door...from the doorman to the front desk I have never stayed anywhere where the service was so above and beyond expectations. Whether you need a manicure appointment or a dinner reservation you don't even have to think about it...the front desk staff takes care of your requests. We also like the pre-visit call to see if we have any special needs during our stay. It's the little touches that make the Drisco such an elegant experience.

<Content>Wonderful experience My husband and I have stayed at various hotels and BB's on our frequent trips to San Francisco. We found the Drisco last spring on a walking tour of Pacific Heights and the Tripadvisor reviews encouraged us to stay there. From Marti's helpfulness with our reservation to her phone call before we left home to the hot towel and water bottle given us at check-in ( both welcome after a long flight) we knew we had made the right choice. Elizabeth is a gem, helping us with directions and restaurant suggestions and giving us ideas of things to do.The room was immaculate and the bed was very comfortable. Our room had been newly renovated so everything felt and looked very fresh and clean. Breakfast is quite good featuring hot and cold cereal, bagels, pastries, meats and cheese and delicious orange juice.Others have mentioned the noisy pipes. They are only noisy when the heat goes on, which, when we stayed, was usually after 7 or 7:30 am. However there is another caveat- even though the hotel is in a quiet neighborhood the garbage trucks and recycling pickup can still be noisy. The trucks did not come too early and I am sure there are interior rooms where the sound is more muffled. We loved the location of our room and would choose it again regardless of street noise.The hotel is not far from both Fillmore and Union Streets each of which has trendy boutiques and restaurants. We also enjoyed free walking tours given by City Guides. If you are an ice cream fan don't miss Mitchell's near Hayes Valley and Naia in the Castro.We are looking forward to our next stay at the Drisco!

<Content>Wonderful Experience! Fantastic stay! Great, helpful staff . . very knowledgeable about the city. Wonderful continental breakfast in the morning. Beautiful rooms with exquisite toiletries. One funny story is that I made a comment on a feedback card on a suggestion for the bathroom and the general manager wrote me a personal letter back addressing my comment. That is just great in a day in age where service seems to have disappeared. Highly recommended for a quite stay in San Fran.

<Content>Enjoyed my stay here, very welcoming A terrific independent hotel, recommended to me by a friend. Much personal attention from charming and very helpful staff. Very welcoming. Others have commented below positively about the location, and I agree with them. I only have one very trivial gripe: the lighting for reading in the bedroom could have been better; not a big deal really. Highly recommended.

<Content>Absolutely Lovely Hotel DriscoWe've been flirting with the idea of booking a luxury hotel via Luxury Link (where there are auctions and such and so you can nab a good deal on upscale accommodations) and our first try was a three night package, in a suite, at the Hotel Drisco in San Francisco. After I checked out the deal -- about $700 for three nights, with some minor extras -- I sussed out the hotel on TripAdvisor and at the time it was the top-rated hotel in San Francisco! Not bad. It had descended to no. 4 by the time we booked (still not bad) and so we committed. Loved it. The Drisco, as a cab driver who picked us up there commented, is the incognito hotel. If you want a Union Square location in the middle of everything, this isn't the place for you. But if you want to be in the heart of one of the most glamorous, beautiful neighborhoods in any city in the U.S., a relatively convenient walk from key city amenities like restaurants and shops, it's a great place. It felt very European. Cozy. Great service that starts with a call to your home a few days before arrival. Do you want to use our car service from the airport? For a $15 difference between hiring an ordinary taxi and using a dedicated car, we bit and it was worth it. When the driver pulled up in front of the hotel, on a peak crest of the hills overlooking the Bay, I thought it was a private club. It felt like that the whole time. Scrupulously well-maintained (and in fact they were upgrading rooms and suites while we were there with new carpets, flat screens and DVDs to replace existing electronics). Great bathrooms with deep soaking tubs. Nice amenities. With a quiet and lofty presence above San Francisco (our suite, living room with television, couch, cozy by-the-window chairs, and our bedroom, with a working desk, free Internet, another television, great bed, bathrobes and slippers) had great city views. The whole feeling was of a first rate hotel for those who like feeling comfortable, and even pampered, without pretension. At cocktail hour there was a wine and savories set-up, quite cozy (and we even brought in a local friend and no one batted an eye, only wished I remembered the name of the white wine because it was crisp and delicious). Breakfast was European in nature -- cold cuts, yogurt, oatmeal, made-to-order coffees, croissants. Included in, I believe, all room rates (though check on it). Adored the neighborhood -- with its multi-million dollar mansions, gorgeous greenery (even in February). Service at the desk was consistently excellent. I asked for taxis, for the exact color of the paint in the breakfast room (a very nice yellow, we're buying a new-old house and I love yellow), even asking for a promised-in-our-deal bottle of sparkling wine, which hadn't been delivered, was met with a gracious apology and fixed immediately. Would return to the Drisco, part of the Joie d'Vivre chain (and my first experience with this boutique hotel group) without qualification. The only qualification I will offer is that good news, bad news bit about the location. The neighborhood is gorgeous. But it's a good five to seven blocks (easy) from anything commercial. If you walk over to Fillmore Street, to Pacific Heights and Cow Hollow shops and restaurants, wear comfy shoes cause you're going to experience the hills that made San Fran so famous. Even more challenging: the Marina District below. It's in interesting mountain slog (up and down) to Lombard Street and points below, like Chestnut Street's restaurants and shops (I used to live in the Marina so I was more inclined to head downward this way). FYI, we had a great time at Curbside Two (again, a steep slog down toward Presidio), a fantastic small, provincial French bistro -- the weather was so crystal clear blue and warm weather crisp that I had my burger and fries (awesome) and glass of Syrah at a picnic table outside. It was a favorite off-beat place when I lived there and it was great to see it was the same. We had dinner at A16 on Chestnut Street in the Marina, which is currently a hot place; I was underwhelmed by this Italian bistro. We had a surprisingly romantic lunch at Emporio Rulli Gran Caffe, which reminded me more of the old fashioned kind of department store restaurants (in ambience, a bit鈥ld fashioned). But the food was excellent and so was the wine. A big surprise on the strip. Didn鈥檛' get to Bistro Aix (it was closed on the nights we were there) but wished we had; the menu looked lovely. Next trip. Will just make sure I get a real series of workouts in steep, hill-climbing scenarios.And by the way: though we did have the pleasure of wandering the bay front around the Marina, we never did make it into the heart of San Francisco. Frankly, I felt like I'd found a heart where we were鈥?

<Content>Location, Location, Location My wife and I spent a few days here while shopping for real estate. Our room had an interesting view, was a nice size, and was clean and fresh. The staff helpful. We loved the architectural details, scale, neighborhood, and nearby shops. We used public transportation this trip and found this a convenient location since there is a bus stop nearby. Mostly we walked around the immediate area. We are planning to move into this neighborhood and we are happy that there is a decent hotel for family and friends to use when they visit us. Two thumbs up from your new neighbors.

<Content>Other Reviewers Were Right! I always check Tripadvisor before staying in a new hotel, but lately have been booking my hotels BASED on Tripadvisor reviews. That is how we came to stay at the Hotel Drisco this past weekend. We didn't want to stay in Union Square and I love the location of the hotel in super quiet (some might say out of the way) Pacific Heights. I also prefer independent hotels, rather than large chains. Things I really love about Hotel Drisco:I loved that the concierge emailed us in advance of our stay to offer their services. I love the coffee and tea service set out in the parlor. My husband loved the cookies.I love the compact fluorescent bulbs. Yay conservation!I love that the staff bent over backwards to find us a Chinese restaurant that would deliver.I love that they will create customized guides for guests. We did not use this feature as my husband grew up in SF, but I was tempted to anyway!Our room was well appointed.The only thing that I was so-so on was that we had a basement room. It would definitely be preferable to have a room on the upper floors (light/view, etc). This could have been because we had only booked 2 weeks prior, or it might have been that we were traveling with our baby. The room felt a little remote.Oh and it wasn't a big deal for us, but the cable reception was terrible. We received just a couple of channels. It was probably something specific to our TV and wasn't even worth a call to the desk.I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to my friends.

<Content>a 7 out of 10 rating My wife and I stayed at Drisco recently. Neat room, but a bit small. Because it is an old hotel, the floor squeaks. The heater is from 1930s, and we have to ask the front desk to turn the switch off because it is too hot in the room. There is no way to control the temperature in the room. If we open the windows, then we hear noises from outside. Parking on the sloop is quite a challenge! Sometimes it may be difficult to find a parking space. I have traveled to some 40 countries, and my expectation of a hotel may be a bit higher than others, and so I will give the hotel a 7 out of 10.

<Content>Hotel Drisco is a +10!!!! The European Charm of this hotel cannot be explained in words. The charming parlor, rooms, and gathering room plus location, views, service, maintenance and amenities are phenominal. Don't need a restaurant as there are so many charming ones within walking distance. And talk of service - the bellhop from the hotel went to the liquor store for us to grab a bottle of vodka as we were running short on time to get to our party. How about that for service!!!!

<Content>charming but lonely I can understand all the rave revues, since I succumb to the same charm. Bur those choosing Drisco for the first time need to know more than that its ambience, service, maintenance, and amenities are especially good, and that your fellow guests are interesting and amiable for the most part over a glass of wine.But there is no restaurant, and nothing commercial within walking distance, and so entertaining becomes complex, and even a drug store or lunch requires two taxi rides.The space heaters work well, but be sure to get one. The staff, particularly Bob, was thoughtful and helpful. He found me a telephone recharger left behind by someone else.I liked the Drisco a lot, and may well stay there again, but I would plan meals and activities differently.

<Content>An Unique Experience There really is no other place like the Hotel Drisco in my experience. Where else can you wile away the morning reading the variety of newspapers offered in the sunny parlor; have a very lovely European style breakfast that comes free with your room; and enjoy a gratis wine reception every evening with cheese and canapes? The staff is very accommodating and the rooms beautifully appointed. Well-stocked mini-bar and a lovely selection of fruit is provided. It's also nice to open the window and enjoy the lovely view (ask for a city view room) and fresh air. Far nicer than the usual over-cooled stale air you get in the typical high-rise hotel. The location is quite convenient to the Presidio, which offers all kinds of hiking options. The hotel neighborhood itself is just a lovely place to walk around, and offers many good restaurants nearby. This hotel is truly like a home away from home, and I'll look forward to my next opportunity to go back and visit.

<Content>A unique pleasure We have stayed at the Hotel Drisco the last three times we have traveled to San Francisco. We like to make long weekends in the city and there are many features that other hotels just can't offer. The location, in Pacific Heights, is incredible. The neighboring 2-3 blocks consist of the most elegant homes in the city. Really, they are mansions with values of $10 plus with incredible views. The Drisco is also within walking distance to eating and shopping on Union Street and Filmore Street. If you want more than the big department stores downtown, this is a great place to stay. The Hotel is very quiet, very comfortable, and the breakfast and evening wine/snacks is very well done. While you can't realistically walk to Union Square or the Wharf, it is only a $10-$12 cab ride to almost anywhere in the city. The bus system is also very efficient and a great way to see new areas of the city.

<Content>Don't even bother to look at other hotels... Found this hotel by reading trip advisor ratings and comments and thank you thank you thank you to everyone that gave this place a 5. I totally agree- it is completely lovely...very warm, inviting, friendly, beautiful, immaculate and delicious continental (plus) breakfast and very nice evening wine and cheese. The only minor potential problem was the parking...it was in the back of my mind at certain times...but the door man seemed to know just when the meter maid was coming!Cannot wait to return and would not imagine staying elsewhere.

<Content>My favorite San Francisco hotel My husband and I recently stayed at the Hotel Drisco for the third year in a row. As usual, it was perfect. Marti can't be nicer and worked hard to get us into Quince for our wedding anniversary. We love the location in Pacific Heights. We love to walk down to the Palace of the Fine Arts for exercise in the morning and then come back and have the fabulous breakfast at the hotel. My only regret is that we don't stay longer, but we are always on our way up to the Wine Country. I am so happy that we found this hotel and I recommend it to everyone. Hopefully, I'll still be able to get a reservation.

<Content>Great staff but needs work! We had chosen a suite since we were celebrating our 25th anniversary  they provided us with champagne in a bucket of ice with a little card, which was very thoughtful. The staff were pleasant  generally helpful.My gripe, though, is that in comparison to hotels we've stayed in, it didn't measure up. Other hotels for the same price or less, including the Biltmore Millenium, Hotel del Coronado  the Grande Colonial provided us with daily bottled water  better quality toiletries  quieter rooms. Continental breakfast included oatmeal, cold cereals, toast, cold hard boiled eggs (which had to be peeled), croissants, coffee, tea  juice. They did provide fresh fruit in the rooms, which is a nice touch. The hotel, in general, needs updating. The curtains are stained  the carpets are starting to wear. The walls are paper thin  we could hear conversations from the other bathrooms  bedrooms including the gentleman snoring on the other side of our bed! It has the original windows, which is fine, it's a historic building ,but there is no way to block some of the outside noise. They had shades, which were rather cumbersome to put up  down. Heavy insulated curtains would block out some of the street noise  keep the rooms warmer. We generally, prefer older buildings but after this stay, we're rethinking that idea!

<Content>Great Weekend Stay I proposed to my now-fianc茅e over Labor Day Weekend in SF. I wouldn't change anything that we did, including selecting Hotel Drisco for accommodation. The service was great, provided by its attentive and personal staff. The 100-plus year-old building offered historic charm to complete a perfectly romantic weekend.

<Content>A home away from home I just wanted to drop you a short note expressing how pleased we were to have stayed at the Drisco Hotel while visiting my daughter in SF. I wanted to tell you how impressed we were with the warm and personal service that we received from all your all employees. We come to SF several times a year and plan on coming again in February again and of course will make reservations in advance. I also have recommended the hotel to several friends who also have children living in SF.We could not be more pleased with your hotel and look forward to our next stay. It has become our home away from home.

<Content>Very relaxing stay I booked Hotel Drisco after reading the reviews on this site and was very pleased with it so thank you to all previous reviewers! Rooms are spacious, very comfortable and quiet. with lovely scented bathroom products from Lather. Wine hour is also a good way to relax! The hotel is in a very smart part of town but not very near the centre of the action. In other words, you need to be prepared to jump in a cab or catch a bus if you want to go anywhere.

<Content>Cozy, inviting and relaxing I booked this hotel based solely on the reviews found on TripAdvisor.com and was glad I did. One previous reviewer aptly describes the Hotel Drisco as a home with elegance and upscale amenities. You do indeed feel like you've come to stay in a very cozy and relaxing home. Only it's better than home because you have this wonderful staff to take care of you. Our favorite was Julio, the gentleman who served our wine during the afternoon wine reception. He very genuinely goes out of his way to accommodate your request. On our first night, my husband and I asked him for a restaurant recommendation. He recommended 2 of his favorites by providing menus, reviews and directions (we chose Cafe Maritime). On the second night of our stay, we decided to stay in. We had walked all the way to Fisherman's Wharf, the Ferry Building and back and we were too exhausted and achy to do much more than enjoy a glass or two of wine and climb into our very comfy bed. Julio made up a bowl of fruit for us to enjoy as an evening snack. Honestly, no hotel employee has ever made that effort with us before. We hope that hotel management appreciates what a gem of an employee they have! I've noticed a few reviews where mention is made of the hotel's out of the way location as if this is a con instead of a pro. To each his own. We visit San Francisco for a long weekend every year and we WALK everywhere. How else do you truly get to experience such an abundance of wonderful, diverse neighborhoods? This trip we enjoyed two of these: peaceful, stately Pacific Heights with its magnificent views and beautiful homes to drool over and Cow Hollow (Union Street) with its many bars, restaurants and boutiques. Some of the other amenities we enjoyed: free bottled water in the room, the delicious cookies offered at nightly turn-down service, a customized tourist package, coffee and tea service offered off the reception area and the additional amenities offered for purchase in the room. I would suggest the wine reception hour be lengthened to allow travelers time to check in and still have time to enjoy this wonderful amenity without feeling rushed.We will be back for another relaxing and comforting stay! A couple of tourist tips: -Pier 23 Cafe is a great place for breakfast or lunch on the water. -the Ferry Building is awfully-crowded on a late Saturday morning. NOT enjoyable!!

<Content>"Outstanding" We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary at the Hotel Drisco in the wonderful neighborhood of Pacific Heights.Decided to be away from the downtown area as needed a quiet place in which to open the windows at night. It was so quiet and the bed extremely comfortable. No need to hang the do not disturb sign on your door.This hotel provides such wonderful service!! Elizabeth was quick to email me back when I asked if we should rent a vehicle? We rented one and the parking was never a problem as she stated....plus no parking fee's!!!. Victor checked us in upon arrival and if we needed something he stopped what he was doing and fulfilled our needs. Julio took care of us at the wine reception and breakfast....what a first class gentlemen! From the minute the doorman greets you with his welcoming smile....you'll know....this truly is your home away from home!WOW....Outstanding!!

<Content>Excellent Hotel I was in San Francisco for a wedding and the Hotel Drisco was recommended by the bride and groom. Though our stay was short and sweet (Friday to Sunday), we could not have been more comfortable at the Drisco. The front desk accomodated for everything. The hotel location puts so many great restaurants within walking distance. Our room was on the first floor but it was still a great room. From check it to check out, our stay at the Drisco was perfect.

<Content>The thrill of discovering a hidden gem After carefully reading most of the reviews on the Hotel Drisco, I felt confident that I had made the right choice in choosing this off the beaten track and small hotel. I wasn't disappointed! Having stayed in the large, impersonal and crowded hotels along the waterfront and on Van Ness, I wanted to be away from the tourists and the most popular tourist areas. I looked forward to walking, and over the 3 1/2 days that we were in San Francisco my husband and I walked about 65 km (40 mi.). Buses are available to take you wherever you want to go (or back towards the Hotel) if you are too tired to walk back. Being on the crest of a hill, leaving the Hotel is the easy part - it is the return trip that can be challenging, and I am always amazed at just how steep the hills can be. You will certainly burn off a good portion of your Ghirardelli chocolate on the way back to the Hotel, especially if you climb the almost 300 steps on Lyon Street back up to Broadway!!I wanted to commend Julio who presides over the evening wine aperitifs who made us feel like family and gave us some great advice on local restaurants and sights to see. I also highly recommend the Town car airport pick-up and drop-off - more expensive than the airport shuttle but worth every penny in comfort, convenience and conversation with Roberto. Our room in the Hotel was small but comfortable. We were on the fourth floor at the end of a private hallway, and had views of both the harbour and the city. Street noise does carry at night but we found this varied, with some nights being very quiet and other nights being much noisier. We did have to open the windows as the room did become stuffy after an hour or two. I understand that some renovations will be occuring shortly. Some of the furniture in our room was showing wear and tear. The bed was very comfortable (and I have a bad back, so I was grateful for this) and the towels and housecoats are some of the nicest I have had in a hotel. The continental breakfast is very good but could have used some variety from day to day - perhaps a variety of pastries (but don't change those blueberry scones!) or a fruit salad with those wonderful California melons. Bottom line is if you enjoy unique and charming surroundings in a small, out-of-the-way hotel with personal service, the thrill of exploring an historic city on foot, and discovering hidden gems of restaurants and shops, then this is the Hotel and area for you.

<Content>Did not want to leave Pick the hotel b/c of the location and could not be happier. The neighborhood is beautiful and quite. It is very nice and clean hotel and the staff is OUTSTANDING. The breakfast in the morning was wonderful, it is not your standard continental breakfast. The wine happy hour in the evening is very nice, they put out different games you can play or just sit and enjoy your wine. We stayed there 4-nights and then were leaving for the wine country...hated to leave the hotel. This is the only place I will stay in SF!

<Content>Nice stay We stayed at a City View Suite and it was comfortable, clean and quiet. The staff is helpful and bed was fantastic. My complaint is about breakfast; though orange juice was nice, during six days we stayed there, everyday we had the same food. It would have been good to have more variety to choose. But that's not very important, so I will come back to Drisco Hotel in my next visit to San Francisco.

<Content>Very nice but specify room choice First trip to San Fran for my wife and I and a friend who lives in Pacific Heights recommended we stay at the Drisco. Our flight was very delayed and we did not get from Oakland to San Fran until midnight. We called the front desk and the night accountant/assistant was OUTSTANDING with his directions and help. We were totally lost and he was very patient and went out of his way looking up various maps for getting us to the hotel. We had not eaten dinner so we asked for a late night grill and he recommended Liverpool Lil's which was only a few blocks down the street. Grill was open at midnight and they served terrific food. Very cool, Irish pub. For those who would like a quick stop for a pint and lunch/dinner, you can't go wrong with Liverpool Lil's and it's close to the hotel. We checked in and were booked in one of the rooms on the first floor literally behind the check-in desk. Window was open to Pacific avenueand although the room was very nice, be sure to ask for an upper level room or something towards the back of the hotel. We heard EVERY noise on the street, including the conversations at the check-in desk when someone arrived late for check-in. Several people staying at the hotel arrived at 3am in the morning and proceeded to stand out in front right next to our windows smoking cigarrettes and talking loudly. The next morning when we got up and opened the windows for the cool fresh air, the smokers lingering outside would fill the room with the smoke/smell. The room was clean (albeit a little outdated with old carpet) but comfortable. Front desk help was first class and made up for the bad room location. My wife and I both agreed we would stay here again but only if we could get a different room.

<Content>Charming and quiet If you want to stay outside of the bustle of Union Square, the Hotel Drisco is the best choice. The neighborhood it's in (Pacific Heights) is one of the nicest in the city, residential with plenty of shops/restaurants on Fillmore. You get much better views of the city here than in the Nob Hill/Union Square area. If you're getting around by bus, it takes a while to get downtown, but if you're driving, street parking is not a problem. Respect the time limits, though. If you're over three hours in one spot, you'll likely get a ticket (we did). The hotel itself is charming, with high quality furnishings and amenities in the rooms (even if not quite up to the level of the Ritz), and a friendly staff. Breakfast is fantastic. I could not recommend the hotel more highly. A great value for the quality of the hotel.

<Content>The Drisco is 'tops' at the top of Pacific Heights We once lived in San Francisco for several years and now visit San Francisco often, usually staying close to Union Square (Andrews Hotel or Petite Auberge) or Fisherman's Wharf (Tuscan Inn). This 3 night trip we decided to learn a new neighborhood and sought out the Drisco because it was in Pacific Heights and part of the same small hotel group as the Petite Auberge. It is located in on of the grandest modern residential streets in the city, and literally at the top of a very steep hill near the Presidio's east side. Though I was a bit worried that we would be too far away from things, our wonderful experience made up for any inconvenience of the location. There is a good bus line only 1 block away (down the hill) -we walked or used the bus to go places (especially the Fillmore Street shopping/restaurant area) - then usually got a cab back to the hotel -especially at night (as from the theatre) when we were tired. If climbing hills isn't on your agenda, a car or cab is a necessity. As others have noted, the front desk staff was FABULOUS - even loaning us a copy of a book detailing interesting walking tours in SF. Our King room was on the 2nd floor overlooking the street, but off in the far distance we could see the city,the Oakland bridge, and a bit of the Bay. We happened to be looking out our window the night Barry Bonds broke the home run record and saw the baseball stadium fireworks celebrating the event - magical. Our room was on a separate short hallway with another (corner) room- if you wanted 2 rooms as a suite, I think (?) the hallway door to the main hallway could be locked. As the room windows faced southeast, our room was really sunny most of the day - VERY bright and cheerful (a white bedspread helped too). There were drawers for clothes under the TV and a HUGE closet (for a hotel that is).Some of the other reviews said the rooms needed renovation, but we thought ours was lovely. Though the usual snacks and drinks were for sale in the room, there was a complimentary bottle of water- nice. The extra special toiletries for sale were a bit pricey, but tempting (like fizzy balls for the bathtub). The room decoration was traditionally elegant, tending towards the restrained rather than fussy, with the bathroom reminding me of Restoration Hardware/Pottery Barn style. A newspaper is hung on your doorknob mornings in a trim canvas bag - a surprising little touch that indicates the management is really trying to make a stay pleasing. As the hotel is on a steep hill, the breakfast room (more like an elegant dining/living room) is in the basement but has large windows with view to the street...and a seating area in addition to tables for those who just want a coffee and to read the paper. The breakfast (included in room rate) had cereals/fruits/deli meats/ breads/drinks - very ample for a good start to the day. The only disappointment was that the wine  cheese in the late afternoon was in a smallish reception/living room and sparsely attended during our stay. In the Petite Auberge, the same event always had tons of people to visit with - exchange travel  tourist hints, etc. Perhaps our experience happened because we perceived fellow guests at the Drisco included families with children (8 yrs or so up- no little children) and under 35's, not the baby boomers / retirees more common at the Petite Auberge....But I wouldn't mark the hotel down for that as it might just have been the mix of guests during our stay. We booked on the Joie de Vivre group website and got a good discount for staying 3 nights. The photos from other guests give a good representation of the hotel's atmosphere. Even thought the Drisco is removed from the main tourist areas, there are many walks to take (Union Street, the Presidio, the Lyon steps, historic Pacific Heights, and close to the Exploratorium and Marina/ Ft. Mason/Greens Restaurant). It is soooooo relaxing/quiet because of the residential location - we felt a part of the neighborhood and loved not seeing tons of tourists. This hotel is popular, so one needs to plan ahead to book if you want specific rooms or dates. We can't wait to return!!

<Content>We would stay again My husband and I stayed for only one night at the Drisco Hotel and were please with the service and the room. The hotel is a quiet little gem hidden in a residential neighborhood. Here are some details that we found during our stay:1. We had a suite on the second floor of the hotel overlooking the road. I was a bit nervous that we would be bothered by street sounds but we were not (I am a light sleeper).2. The room was tastefully decorated and it appeared that our room had been updated recently as there were not many signs of wear.3. The walls (or at least ours) were very thin. We could hear our neighbor snoring during the night which was more problematic than overlooking the street.4. Parking: The hotel does not have parking but there is plenty of on street parking, however READ parking signs, they do street cleaning I think like twice a week and if you park on the wrong side you will end up with a ticket. 5. Breakfast: we were not aware that breakfast was included. I ordered a small pot of coffee and toast to our room and when we checked-out they said breakfast was included. It still seems a bit strange to me but it is worth asking about.6. If you are looking for a hotel that is close to the tourist area this may not be the best choice. We did not mind taking a taxi to where we needed to go and liked being in a quiet neighborhood.We would stay at the Dricso Hotel again.

<Content>Extremely helpful staff and a lovely hotel We stayed here for one night on arrival to San Francisco from the UK. We arrived very tired only to find our reservation had not been received by them (error with the booking operator, not the hotel's fault). The guy at the front desk (I think he was called Bobby) was incredibly helpful- he was on the phone for ages being transferred to several departments to sort it out for us. Thankfully he got our confirmation faxed through to him and by sheer luck still had one room left. I am so glad he did- the rooms were lovely. My only regret is that we weren't staying longer. Lovely staff and beautiful hotel in a very safe area. There didn't seem to be many ammenities around but that didn't worry us.

<Content>A Little Gem For all of you wanting honest reviews, you have come to the right place, and as I come from England, where we specialise in moaning, you can be fairly sure that if we say its good, it truly is!This was our first trip to SF, and I agonised over hotels for some time, particularly weighing up a central location against one further out. In choosing The Drisco, I have no doubt that we made absolutely the right choice (given that we Brits are also mean, and thus will never spend more than we have to. In other words, its good value, as I do not have the requisite funds to lounge at The Mark Hopkins).While you could criticise The Drisco for being a little way out of the centre, the upside is that it is quiet (give or take the odd dustbin lorry, sorry, garbage truck at 8.00am), and you are in a very attractive (and achingly affluent) neighbourhood. In any event, a taxi ride is simple to arrange (thanks to the very helpful staff at The Drisco, sometimes up to 3 times a day) and the cost is very modest. You also then get to meet some of the miriad of interesting characters that SF has to offer, as the taxi drivers are a mirror of this cosmopolitan city, many amusing and charming, the odd one rude or mad, but always different.In summary for The Drisco - Excellent, friendly and helpful staff, comfortable and clean rooms with neat little touches of detail, modestly stylish decor that struck the right balance between neutrality and warmth, very good breakfast, emminently useable fitness room, and a place that you looked forward to coming back to. My gripe is purely the quality of the television programmes, but then thats hardly the fault of the Hotel. Oh, and more of their delectable free cookies would have been nice, but then thats simply me being greedy.And there are places within walking distance, providing you dont mind a bit of an uphill hike back to the Hotel. This includes a number of good restarants, but none better than Elizas at California Street - Authentic chinese, possibly the best I have ever tasted, and at ridiculously reasonable (or frankly low for us bearing in mind the pound's supremacy over the dollar at present) prices.Big thumbs up for The Drisco, and indeed for San Francisco. We loved our weeks stay, and will be back at some point in the future.

<Content>Charming Hotel Drisco We only had one night in San Francisco. Didn't want to stay in a chain hotel. Found Hotel Drisco on the Internet and called to book. This is an excellent older hotel. Very comfortable. We got a good night's sleep. The staff is exceedingly friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excellent. We'll be back.

<Content>A lovely surprise What a surprise. We were going to San Francisco for New Years Eve and booked this about a week before. The hotel is lovely. The rooms are beautiful and immaculate. The hallways are a little rundown, but nothing to be concerned about ,and the elevators are small. Other than that it was a great experience. There is a lovely breakfast in the the morning and wine and cheese in the evening in the parlor. All delicious. The rooms are bright with beautiful views of historic residential San Francisco. There isn't a lot in walking distance and there isn't room service, but a nice snack mini bar. Why would you eat in your hotel in San Francisco anyway? Great value for the price. I would definitely say it's a stay!

<Content>It is great and yet it is not... In of itself, the hotel is elegant, homey and charming. The desk clerks work very hard to please in their dual role of clerk and concierge. They seemed overburdened but do not complain at all.Everyone smiles at you and the hotel is very service-oriented. I thought the prices were reasonable and the rooms comfortable and attractive. We had a 2 - room suite with an elegant bathroom. Nice view from one room also. The brunch is excellent and they provide good newspapers.The problems are that the hotel can't exist in a vacuum. Therefore if you walk outside you are in an affluent residential neighborhood with great architecture, but there is NOTHING THERE. There are some free fruit in the room but there is very limited room service(heated panini at $8.50 per). The closest store, restaurant, cafe or drug store is 12 blocks away. The taxi drivers themselves told me they won't go up there unless dropping off a fare so you need to leave a good amount of time to find a taxi also. It is virtually near nothing. So you have to weigh the charms of the hotel itself versus thelack of civilization.

<Content>Terrific A truly superb hotel. As visitors from Australia, we were looking for something a little different in this wonderful city - and got it. It is small enough to allow for the personal touch and is imbued with a comfortable grace and elegance which you do not find in the normal large and modern hotels. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. It is located in the magnificant Pacific Heights area - we thoroughly enjoyed walking around the surrounding streets, by day and night, enjoying the views and the houses. It is a comfortable walk to Fillmore and Union Streets where there are plenty of great shops and restaurants. We also had a memorable dinner at the nearby Garibaldi's restaurant. It is too far to walk to the Downtown and Fisherman's Wharf areas- but taxis are plentiful and the fare to and from the hotel is reasonable. We will definitely be coming back.

<Content>Best Hotel in SF!! I lived in Sausalito for 11 years before moving to San Diego over 7 years ago, and so have stayed in many in the Bay Area for our frequent return visits. I've also traveled extensively for pleasure and for work and, I have to say, this was one of our most pleasant hotel experiences ever! The staff was outstanding, the room was lovely, the location was premier (we love to walk and explore the neighborhoods and this is perfect for that), and the breakfast was outstanding. There were so many little extras that you don't often see anymore, like complimentary wine and cheese in very pleasant front room each evening, chocolates and turn down service, a little stuffed dolphin in the crib they provided for our 14 month old son, beautiful bath products (some for purchase, others complimentary), great restaurant recommendations and directions, walking distance to wonderful restaurants and shopping, complimentary use of the gym in the beautiful Presidio park, and on and on. We were so happy, too, because the staff was so warm and wonderful with our little toddler, and greeted him with delight (as he did them) each time we returned to the lobby. Some hotels are stuffy and don't really like having children around, but that was clearly not the case at the El Drisco. We'd only planned to stay one night, but booked an extra night after having such a wonderful experience the first night. We haven't stopped talking about it since we arrived home a week ago. I have to say, though, that I am somewhat reluctant to spread the word and write a glowing review, because I'd like to keep this as our own little secret getaway. In fact, I've never written a review about any hotel, but this one is such a find that I had to share my thoughts. I hope you enjoy the El Drisco as much as we did! We will certainly be back!!

<Content>Just Excellent In town conducting difficult family business. Wanted and got a soothing place to stay while in the city. Slept with window open due to warm evening, got the best nights sleep of my life in any hotel! Quiet area and the staff is top notch. Zero fooling around, all dress well and behave appropriately. Much appreciated. Parking was fine in the area too, which helped a lot. Breakfast was great. You'll like this place. It only takes a few bucks more to do it right and the Drisco was a good value.

<Content>Best Ever! My expectations were high, but the Drisco met and exceeded them, which is a rare occurrence for me in my world travels. From the moment we walked in it felt like a private club, a home away from home. We had a corner suite with views from the tip of the Golden Gate Bridge all the way to the Bay Bridge. Extraordinary. The staff was excellent, courteous and very professional. Breakfast was terrific and afternoon wine service enabled us to meet some of the interesting guests. A home run!

<Content>The Hotel Drisco is the Best!~ I found this hotel on trip advisor and booked 2 suites for my parents and their friends that were going to be traveling to SF. I also booked at the Four Seasons, because the people they were traveling with are a bit hard to please when it comes to accommodations and the Drisco does not have valet parking, which I thought may be a problem. They decided on staying at the Drisco and were so pleased they did. I booked 2 City View Suites and they were amazing! Great views and huge rooms. The reception desk assured me parking would not be hard for them to find (they are not City drivers by any means) and it wasn't! They found a spot right outside the hotel! They staff was fabulous and what a good deal. I think the suites were 279 a night! Highly recommended!

<Content>We felt pampered My husband and I went to Hotel Drisco (which we had never heard of before) as a gift. What a wonderful gift it was for us! We've never gone to a hotel where there was someone to open the front door for us or where the front desk hands you a plate with warm wet wash cloths to wipe your face and hands after your long trip to get there. Nice touch! The room was lovely (A King Suite-Wong Room). It had fresh whole fruit in a basket ready to eat, robes and slippers for each person and some special treats for use in the bathroom. The bed was soooo comfortable and we are a bit picky when it comes to hotel beds. The continental breakfast was just delicious and there was a great variety of foods and beverages to choose from that morning. I'm so glad we were able to go, and we are looking forward to coming back when our anniversary rolls around.

<Content>My new favorite place to stay This hotel is wonderful. The staff is friendly and ready to answer any question one may have about just about anything there is to know about San Francisco. The continental breakfast seems a little more than continental and the location is great to get away from everything else. The Fillmore district is walking distance. Fisherman's wharf is minutes away. If you did not know any better, you would not know this was a hotel. This is my home away from home (At least until I purchase a home in SF).

<Content>I love the Drisco! I am very picky. I researched for hours before choosing the Drisco. The Hotel Drisco met all my needs. The hotel was charming and architecturally pleasing, the bathroom and deluxe king room very clean and comfortable, the water hot, the window on the courtyard opened to let in sweet air, the area provided easy parking unlike the Marina where I used to stay and gather tickets, quiet residential surroundings, and central to all activities I enjoyed like the byobw on Lombard, (see youtube for a laugh) a hike up Stow Lake, Chestnut street bbq, and cooking Easter dinner near the Haight for family. Wine and cheese at night and a hearty delicious breakfast in the morning and meeting couples from Oklahoma and South Carolina with whom to share stories were pluses. The staff was nowhere to be seen but always there to keep everything perfect. How do they do that!? And the best thing of all was a knock on my door to find a chocolate bunny waiting for me. I love the Drisco and it met all my expectations and more. I will always stay at the Drisco! Thanks to you all who recommended it!

<Content>Fantastic place to stay while in SFrancisco We spent the night in San Francisco to celebrate my husband's birthday. I had contacted the hotel asking them if I could come by earlier to drop off some champagne and other treats to be placed in the room with a card. When they found out it was my husband's birhtday they told me I did not need to bring any champagne, because that would be on the house. I dropped the other items in the afternoon and went to a meeting I had in San Francisco. Upon my return, everything was already in the room, in nice platters with special folded napkins and even flowers as an arrangement. Very impressive. They also wrote him a card!Everyone on the staff was delightful and extremely friendly. The breakfast was superb and made me start my day just right. The hotel is very clean, well appointed and the rooms are quite large. It feels like you are a special guest in someone's beautiful mansion. If you like walking, the neighboorhood where they are located has gorgeous houses and phenomenal views awaiting to be discovered.

<Content>A cultured hotel The hotel is in a select residential area and attracts an interesting and cosmopolitan range of guests. It is unhurried and professional with an excellent front desk. The 5pm wine interlude gives the chance to meet other guests and to see the world from other people's point of view. Continental breakfast with a good range. A cab ride to most places and good legs required if you wish to walk to local facilites. Try 'Rose's Cafe' or 'Home' on Union Street for light snacks or local restaurant Garibaldi.

<Content>where you aren't a small plastic card with a number on it I felt like a guest at Hotel Drisco--not a customer. I made my reservation on the phone directly with a staff member who, in the course of our conversation, asked me how I learned about the hotel. I explained that my husband and I had eaten there in 1990 when it was called the El Drisco and still had a restaurant, and that the meal had been our first date. And I explained that our return was an anniversary of that event. She seemed quite pleased with my story, and we had a pleasant exchange all around, and it was one of those rare times I was glad I had called instead of making a reservation online. When we arrived we learned we had been upgraded to a suite, and when we opened the door to that suite we found a chilled split of champagne and a lovely chocolate heart waiting for us. Of course none of this thoughtfulness would compensate if the room was unsatisfactory or the hotel a disappointment, but I found it all precisely to my liking. There are photographs of San Francisco from the 1890s on the wall of the hallway, perfectly appropriate for this old, well-preserved building. And the furnishings are tastefully age-appropriate as well--without being fussy or fusty. The bed, thankfully, was modern: firm. The bathroom amenities? Aveda. And there's a neat little bathroom mini-bar with tea bags and fizzers for the bath tub and other such items. But most of all, aside from the occasional creak and water-through-the-pipes whoosh, which I associate with the life of an older building, Hotel Drisco is deeply, soothingly quiet. Like from-another-century quiet. It's the perfect respite from a day of heavy sight-seeing or relative handling. Or, as it was for my husband on that anniversary, and will be for me next week, a perfect rest stop before minor surgery the next day.

<Content>If you need to ask... Hotel Drisco is in the midst of haute Pacific Heights, a beautiful neighborhood of incredibly expensive homes with drop-dead views over the city and the Golden Gate Bridge. Unfortunately, unless you happen to be a mountain goat, there is absolutely nothing within reasonable walking distance that would interest a visitor; not even a drug store or decent wine shop. Only two bus lines come nearby, and a car in San Francisco is almost as useless as one in Manhattan. So, abundant cab fare is a must.The hotel is very European, with generously-sized rooms, just functional bathrooms, and a lovely breakfast buffet(included). There is great light, especially on the fourth floor, where we stayed in a two bedroom suite. Service is limited to the three or four very willing employees, so don't expect big hotel amenities, and you won't be disappoited. If you're tired of the Union Square bustle and can't stand the large, corporate hotels designed for the business traveler, you might find Hotel Drisco a wonderful retreat.

<Content>The Hotel Drisco was delightful Spent three nights wife my wife at the Hotel Drisco in late February. Lovely old hotel with gorgeous suite room. Quite impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the entire staff. Continental breakfast was first rate. Pacific Heights is a remarkable neighborhood - architecture is stunning. The hotel's arrangement allowing guests to us the Presdio YMCA is really nice - great facility within a nice 20 minute walk of the hotel. Catching a taxi for dinner required a few extra minutes though the staff is happy to make arrangements. Would gladly return and highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Very nice Inn - Location could be better Quite lovely BB Style hotel. We booked a room and got a corner suite with separate living room. Bed was very comfortable, service was excellent, complementary internet service was the fastest we've experienced. Unfortunately, the weather was not very good (not the hotel's fault), the hotel has no restaurant or bar, and there were no restaurants, bars or shops within easy walking distance. If you don't mind taking a cab or driving (free on-street parking was easy to find within steps of the door - there was a three-hour daytime parking limit but the bellman offered to move our car for us if we left him the keys) it is a quite comfortable and elegant - if a little pricey - place to stay in the city.

<Content>Simply Wonderful I just returned from a 3 night stay with my husband and my parents. There are only great things to say about this hotel. The rooms were charming, clean and very comfortable. The common spaces invited you to relax while reading the morning paper or over mid-afternoon tea. The staff was welcoming and very helpful. I can't say enough about the location. It is the perfect spot for seeing some of the the most breathtaking views of the city. Being so close to Union and Fillmore Streets made it easy to find a variety of great restaurants nearby. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fabulous Stay! Hotel Drisco was all that we expected and more. We had been told of its ambience and charm - and it certainly had both of those. We were meeting friends for the weekend and exploring San Francisco for the first time.The staff was extremely helpful with directions and recommendations for restaurants. The evening wine and cheese were an elegant touch. Our friend enjoyed the nightly cookies that were part of the turn down service. And the freshly squeezed orange juice with the morning breakfast was as good as we have here in Florida. Thanks to Hotel Drisco, our stay in San Francisco was memorable.

<Content>Great place for wedding families to stay My wife and I used Hotel Drisco three years ago for our families during our wedding weekend. Everybody loved the smaller, more intimate setting and, of course, the location at the top of Pacific Heights. Walk one block to Broadway and you can see the entire Bay... Golden Gate, Marin headlands, Treasure Island, and Alcatraz. We have since moved from the Bay Area but usually stay at Hotel Drisco when we visit.

<Content>Excellent!!!!!! Brilliant hotel with staff to match. This is a great location and close to all you want to see in SF. The only issue is the parking but this appears to be a SF thing. The room was excellent and the front desk very helpful and knowledgeable - try the restaurants they advise it's worth it. The 4 nights we were there were the best out of a 3wk tour of California which included 3 nights in the Venitian in LV. The hotel has a drinks reception 5.30-6.30 which was great to meet fellow guests informally. A great place to relax and unwind with 5 star service to match.

I was in town working for 10 days, with 7 colleagues who stayed there too, and welcomed the extra-comfy beds and quiet location after long, 14-plus-hour days.

<Content>Charming, welcoming, spotless luxury This was my third visit to the Drisco, and my third room/minisuite. This time I had a courtyard view, but did not find the room dark at all, as suggested by reviews below. As always, the bedding was luxe and comfy, as were all the added touches--fresh fruit in the room, slippers in the armoire. It is true that the Drisco is located in a (very ritzy) residential neighborhood--which makes for quiet nights, a real plus--so you do need to ask the staff at the desk to ring for a taxi, which they cheerfully do. Just be sure to give some advance notice. One of my favorite things about the Drisco is its tiny, hidden workout room--one treadmill, one stairstepper, one sta. bike, some weights and that's it. Another favorite is that you can arrange in advance to be picked up in a town car at the airport for only a very few dollars more than what a van service would cost--worth it, worth it, worth it! The staff here are to a person outstanding including and especially the driver of said town car. This really is a fine hotel.

<Content>Perfect honeymoon hotel We stayed here as our first stop on honeymoon in June and it was a real treat! The area of Pacific Heights is just beautiful and the hotel itself was peaceful, refined and atmospheric. If you want a quiet, intimate setting, a real feeling of old-style glamour then this is the place to stay. Breakfasts were perfect and we really appreciated the glass of wine in the lounge after a busy day in the city. Warning - its quite a walk into the main areas of the city and mostly uphill on the way back, but for get away from it all honeymoon bliss it was perfect!

<Content>Near-perfect stay We just returned from a wonderful four-night stay at the Drisco in Pacific Heights. Having previously lived in SF for years, we'd never checked into a local hotel before (but had seen plenty through work and friends). The Drisco was a rate treat -- an affordable property with superior service.PROS:-The views! Be sure to ask for a room with a city or bay view (one person in our group had a courtyard view, and therfore, a dimly lit room). Our city view was, in a word, spectacular: all of Lower Pac Heights, the Haight, downtown... all the way to Twin Peaks.-The rooms and bathrooms were spacious and spotless. Our bathroom had a wall-to-wall window and glassed-in tub/shower so you can catch the view from your bath. -The service was excellent. Turn-down at night comes with fresh cookies and a pitcher of ice. The front desk went out of their way for us, even after we had checked out.-Complementary wine and cheese happy hour every evening.-The free continental breakfast (cereal, oatmeal, croissants, fruit).-The price: a fraction of what other luxury hotels in town charge.CONS-Every morning at 5:45 a.m. on the dot, the strong smell of coffee permeated our room. It literally smelt like someone was brewing a pot right next to our pillows (several other guests shared similar experiences). Obviously, this isn't a problem for those who love coffee -- or get up at 5:45 -- but as we don't, it was unpleasant and hard to fall back asleep-Location. Though the Drisco is in arguably the most beautiful neighborhood in the city, it's very difficult to catch a cab. We ended up waiting at least 25 to 35 minutes, sometimes longer, each time we went anywhere. This is not the hotel's fault, but keep in mind you'll either have to plan/call way ahead or rent a car. All in all, a great stay. Our friends were at the Ritz in Nob Hill and we couldn't really see a difference btwn the two places ... other than a few hundred dollars and the Drisco's less stuffy ambiance.

<Content>The Best After glowing reviews I decided to splurge on the last 2 nights of an 8 day trip up the California coast with my sister and mother. It was well worth it. We had a 4th floor two bedroom corner suite with amazing 180 degree views. It was hard to make ourselves leave to see the sights. The mostly residential upscale neighborhood made us feel very safe but it wasn't within walking distance (for us) to restaurants or the cable car line. We had a car with GPS so didn't find driving to our destinations a problem at all.An excellent continental breakfast and wine/cheese in the afternoon. The front desk was very helpful with restaurant suggestions and reservations. The only negative was that the beds were very uncomfortable given the quality of the hotel and the price.

<Content>A real home from home We stayed in a great downtown hotel on our only visit to San Francisco 10 years ago but had enjoyed a walk through the Paciifc Heights neighbourhood and decided to search there for hotels for this trip. The Drisco best suited our requirements and we weren't disappointed. Very comfortable and friendly with good breakfast. Real coffee, including decaf, and a large variety of tea bags/hot water always available in cozy lounge with portable cups/lids also available if you want to take to your room. We also enjoyed the early evening wine/canapes but, unfortunately, could not always make it back in time as we had lots to pack in to each day. We had a deluxe room which was spacious and well appointed, as was the bathroom. We did originally request a city view (if possible) but got a courtyard view which was fine as we were on the top floor so it was quite light and we weren't planning to spend any time in there anyway (we didn't bother to enquire whether it could be changed). The hotel also provided some very useful information sheets on sightseeing, activities etc.We had no problems staying away from the main activity. We obtained a 3-day Muni pass and found the area well served by buses, either one or two blocks away and it was nice to retire to the peace and quite of such a lovely neighbourhood at the end of the day. We also found nice restaraunts and bars locally and enjoyed strolling past the elegant houses. The Drisco/Pacific Heights was a real home from home, albeit rather more elegant than our own home and neighbourhood!

<Content>Quiet and restful upscale hotel removed from city noise We stayed here for four days in a suite. The suite was great---very large and bed was comfortable but the furniture did show a little wear. Had great views though Pacific Heights. We requested a higher floor and a corner suite and got it. Since we were on the 3rd floor of a four story hotel and this is an older bldg, we did hear the people walking around above us but it was not disturbing---muffled. Breakfast was fine, nothing special. Bellman was great and told us where to park. We never had any trouble finding free parking and as others have noted, the bellman will move your car if you leave it there during the day. The front desk was good with restaurant recommendations. No real complaints except to say that the bath products nex to the tub are not free. We used most of them and then discovered a pricelist for each item had fallen behind the table. Our fault. We had no interest staying anywhere near Union Square, too noisy and crowded. This was a great alternative as taxis are just a phone call away.

<Content>Wonderful family reunion I just had to write after seeing a negative review about, of all things, Pajamas!!?? When my son married in San Francisco several years ago we all stayed there and had a blast. Our room was lovely, the service was exceptional, and my daughter-in-law had her bridesmaids' luncheon there on the day of the wedding, which was delicious and well-served. This hotel is a little bit more expensive than what we usually need, but I would not hesitate to stay there again if the situation called for it. Pisces143

<Content>Like Sleeping in Grandma's Attic Nice hotel in Pacific Heights, but my room had two single beds and was the size of a postage stamp. Not sure why they don't just use one double bed instead, but it felt like I was sleeping in my grandmother's attic. I'm a small woman, but the single bed situation in a nice hotel does not cut it. I didn't sleep very well as a result. The bathroom, on the other hand, was big and the neighborhood, right by the Presidio, is gorgeous.

<Content>"Mmmmmore!" This month I stayed with my partner for two weeks at the Drisco. I have to say, we had a wonderful time: a room with great views overlooking the city where not only Tony Bennett left his heart, service with a smile (a special thank you to Marti and Victor!), breakfasts to die for, the grandeur of the old hotel building and the Pacific Heights quarter in general, addictive daily work outs at the little Drisco gym, the vicinity of the up market shops and boutiques at Fillmore and Union Street (busses #3 and #24 Jackson/Divisadero, connecting bus #22 Fillmore/Jackson): dear Drisco staff, we will certainly return. Warmest greetings!MvB, The Hague

<Content>nice hotel, but bad(amateur) service overall, nice hotel, but bad service.as soon as i arrived, i climbed up the stairs(parlour) to the check in desk and asked for help with my luggage. we had 7 large pieces of luggage. nobody showed up to the street curb and my husband and I unloaded everything from the taxi and carried it up the stairs all by ourselves!!! this was entirely unacceptable but the person at the desk(a young guy) simply somewhat apologized saying he couldn't find anyone. !!??!i decided to forget about this one time bad experience as i guess these mishaps could happen anywhere?the next day i approached the desk to ask a simple question. i was behind a guy who was taking his time to occupy 2 people at the desk(different people from the first day of check in). i patiently waited. the 2 people who were working behind the desk did not aknowledge me once and had me keep on waiting. furthermore, when another customer randomly cut in line and simply approached the desk to ask his question, the woman(older curly hair) behind the counter started helping the other person when she clearly saw me standing in line for at least 5 minutes. WTF!!??this hotel exudes class from the outside, but has none in the inside. the employees are amateurs.

<Content>Lovely hotel off the beaten path My husband and I booked a four night stay in a large King suite at the Drisco. On arriving in SF and realizing that we were a $10 cab ride from the tourist attractions, we were at first disappointed. But the Hotel Drisco's location in Pacific Heights is so lovely and quiet that we quite fell in love with it. Pacific Ave is an elegant street of private homes overlooking the bay. Just gorgeous. The room was huge, clean and attractive; the bathroom was modern and clean. Breakfasts (included) were delicious. The front desk was friendly and even helped me book a side trip to Yosemite one day ahead, when another tour company cancelled at the last minute. I would definitely go back and recommend the Hotel Drisco to anyone (knowing you cannot walk to the cable cars or Fisherman's Wharf).

<Content>Could not wait to stay here....Was really let down I searched high and low for just the perfect hotel for our ONE and ONLY Night in San Francisco. We had traveled to San Francisco all the way from Virginia, and I was so looking forward to Staying at the Drisco. Whe we walked in, it was just like I had imagined, lovely, just like the pictures. I could not wait to get checked in and see the beautifully decorated early 1900's king size room, that hopefully had a city view like I had requested. Upon checking in I was told that they had given our room away to a guest that had wanted to stay another night. There was only one room left, but they would give it to us complimentry. They showed us the room, it was down a hall across from the front desk, it was very, very small, had a view of a window of another room, AND we did not have a bathroom in the room. We would use a bathroom down the hall. The bathroom was just for our own use, but it WAS DOWN THE HALL!!! I was sooo disappointed. It was later in the day, and we had been seeing the cites all day, we were tired and just were looking forward to relaxing and enjoying a beautiful room. I was speechless, as I was just so disappointed in our accomidations.  The service was very nice, the breakfast very nice too, but I just could not get over my disappointment of the room, the view that did not exist, and the bathroom being down the hall. It just was very disappointing for our ONE and Only night in SF. I could of stayed anywhere in San francisco, but I chose the Drisco because of the reviews, location, and quaintness of the rooms that I had read about. I just feel like the Hotel should of offered us a room somewhere else in SF, (and there are many) in another one of the hotels the Joie de Vivre Hospitality boutique hotel's, that company own.

<Content>hard to find fault with this hotel Our stay in the Drisco was a pleasurable experience. Everyone was welcoming and friendly.I was impressed that a member of staff made an effort to find me when I recieved an incoming phone call and I was not in my room.Praise has to be given to the staff who gave a high cleaning standard in our extremely comfortable accomadation.We had a suite and our son a room. We agreed it was the same standard throughout.The continental breakfast was very good and a wine aperitif in the evening was appreciated.Credit has to be given on all members of staff for making it such an enjoyable 3 nights stay.I would definately use this hotel again.

<Content>Nicest staff on earth!! My wife, daughter and I stayed at the Hotel Drisco last week. We had never been to San Fancisco. Being from Indiana we wanted to take our daughter somewhere we had never been, before she went off to college in a few weeks. San Francisco was the right chose and the Hotel Drisco was the perfect place to stay. The staff is the friendlies we have ever had. They gave us great advise on the sights, booked our reservations for dinner every night and even help with moving our car when the streets had to be cleaned. After the first day I was always addressed by my name. I don't know how they remembered, but they did. Pacific Heights is a great area of town and we always felt safe in the neighborhood. I would highly recommend this hotel for any occasion. Families, Business travel or a romantic getaway.

<Content>My personal pied a terre in SF My experience at Drisco started 3 years ago and since then every year I go back I feel at home, located in a beautiful residential area, gves the proper surrounds to relax after a sightseeing day or working day, It麓s style and touch of class make it special , The attention of all the team make me feel a queen and the privacy gave me the space to feel on my own but pampered, its one of the jewels I expect to find when I travel and that make me come back to the same place like a small part of home at Drisco... I am always looking to go back and enjoy the wondeful attention I get there and warmth,,,, that make me feel so good 1!!!!!,, Evangeline..

<Content>Bring your earplugs... Loved eveything about the place except that there were no earplugs supplied for those of us staying on the lower floor. SF Marathon was the next morning and we heard the couple above us preparing to go and watch it at 4:45 am-complete with toilet use, talking, dressing, shoe droppings, walking around and finally leaving the room. Would definitely stay there again but will bring earplugs...

<Content>Favorite place in San Francisco We stayed at the Hotel Drisco in celebration of our daughter's law school graduation. Having visited San Francisco numerous times over the last thirty years, we have finally found a home away from home. Located in a quiet, safe neighborhood perfect for strolls and views of the bay, the Hotel Drisco has an extremely friendly, helpful staff and a European atmosphere. We stayed with our adult son in an airy two-room suite much larger than most. We were not prepared for the cool weather and requested heat for the room. In no time, a portable heater was delivered which took care of the problem beautifully. We recommend the Hotel Drisco without reservation.

<Content>Thank you Trip Advisor When I booked my holiday, the Drisco was your top rated San Francisco hotel. I am sad to see it has fallen to 6th position since. It deserves to be back at the top. We had an awful 24 hour flight thanks to American Airlines and its bungled booking system. We were so relieved that we had booked the Drisco. Their driver was wonderful and sorted out all our arrangements with regard to delays while we hung around in Dallas and Chicago. He picked us up from the airport at 12 midnight when we were past caring if we arrived in San Francisco or not. And then when we arrived at our destination, we had the most beautiful room which was ready and waiting with sheets turned back ready for us to fall into a deep sleep. I am so glad we chose such a wonderful hotel. It was like home from home and the attention to detail and helpfullness of the staff (particularly Roberto the driver) were very much appreciated. I have mentioned this hotel to all of my friends who live in California, but most of them already know the Hotel and hold it in high regard. What more can I say ??

<Content>Superb stay at the Drisco A spur of the moment idea to celebrate our 39th Wedding Anniversary in San Franciscoyielded one of our favorites hotels, ever--The Drisco.We had tickets for a concert on a Saturday afternoon and thought it might be fun to spendthe night in a lux hotel to add to our celebration. A search on TripAdvisor brought myattention to the Drisco. Since we live just across the bay, we didn't need to be in adowntown location. We preferred charm and personality over a corporate-type hotel.The Drisco had a vacancy for us and I just happened to mention it was our Anniversarywhile speaking to the lovely man on the phone to make our reservation.We quickly packed a bag and made the 1/2 drive across the Golden Gate Bridge ona gorgeous, sunny day to the Pacific Heights area of The City.Knowing The City quite well, we knew we couldn't go wrong in Pacific Heights.We were welcomed to the Hotel like old friends and were given an upgrade (becauseit was our Anniversary) to a gorgeous suite. What a delight!! It was a corner room witha lovely vista out over rooftops across The City with soft, tasteful furnishings and anexquisite bathroom. We were so happy that we decided to spend another night!!And, to top it all off, they brought us champagne and chocolates!!We had a very nice continental breakfast (included) the next morning, coffee and teawere available 24 hours a day in the beautiful sitting room, and they also servedafternoon wine and cookies.We loved every minute of our beautiful weekend celebration. We walked and walkedand walked because in San Francisco there are so many beautiful places with beautifulvistas...The Marina Green to Fort Point...Union Street...Chestnut Street...Pacific Heights...The Presidio...plus so many others.On our second night, the fog rolled in to make the romantic feel complete.Thank You, Hotel Drisco staff, for a wonderful weekend.You will be our home away from home in the City from now on.P.S. Don't change a thing...everything is perfect!!

<Content>An A+!! My wife and I just returned from our trip to Wine Country and San Francisco. We stayed at the Hotel Drisco the first night we got into San Francisco and then for 2 nights after coming back from Sonoma and Napa. We can't say enough good things about the staff (who were extremely helpfull, knowledgable and friendly), the hotel (clean, classy and great location) or the area the hotel is in (quiet, beautifull views and safe area). We will stay there again the next time we go back to San Francisco, without hesitation!-Brad S.

<Content>Can't wait to return! We spent 3 wonderful nights at this hotel and could not fault it. It is a beautiful hotel in a wonderful part of town. This hotel is in a residential area in the Pacific heights area so its location may not appeal to everyone but we loved it.We were travelling with a 2 year old and this is the first hotel where we have ordered a crib to have it waiting for us nicely made up in the room. The rooms was elegantly furnished, spacious and the bathroom was beautiful. We did not experience any noise from neighbouring rooms.The front desk staff were very welcoming and helpful and we could not have asked for more. They were more than happy to provide information on walking tours and other San Francisco information.The complimentary buffet breakfast was tasty and we also managed to enjoy the wine reception on two of the evenings.We could not fault this hotel and would recomend it to anyone who is looking for a classy boutique hotel in a prestigious part of San Francisco.

<Content>Nice, but you can hear the other guests My husband and I booked a King suite at the Hotel Drisco for our wedding night after hearing wonderful things about the hotel from our photographer. The interior was lovely (perfect for taking getting ready shots for the wedding). Everything was clean and fresh looking and staff was pleasant. My parents were a bit dissapointed that after ordering a bottle of champagne to be delivered to the room after the wedding, the staff delivered the champagne too early. When my husband and I arrived to our room there was champagne in a bucket with water (no ice as it had all melted). I have to say, I was a bit dissapointed as well because the staff knew that it was our wedding night and I felt should have gone above and beyond to make sure things were nice for that very reason. For example, when my husband and I were out of town celebrating our engagement (at a different hotel) the person at the front desk sent a complimentary bottle of champage up to our room to congratulate us. The Hotel Drisco staff did not make any attempts to help us celebrate our wedding day or make it an extra special stay. After a long night of partying at our wedding we were ready to sleep in and order breakfast in bed. No such luck! The second the person above us woke up, we could hear them walk to the bathroom, flush the toilet, run the sink, etc. We were up at 6am after getting to bed at 2am--not the bliss I had in mind for my first day as a married woman : ) You really can hear the other hotel guests (and we had a corner room so I guess it was not as bad as it could have been.)

<Content>Our Home Away From Home The Hotel Drisco is our home away from home, that is...when we deeply wish to be nurtured and pampered. In addition to its physical beauty and elegance, on an emotional/spiritual level, every employee and management goes the extra mile to sense and then provide gifts from their hearts. We have been fortunate to stay in highly rated hotels around the world. The Hotel Drisco warms our hearts like none other, and when healing and romance is what we need, we are there. Furthermore, when my husband had hip surgery last year at UCSF, I was soothed and comforted by the quiet Pacific Heights setting, delicious bed and bath linens, and best of all...genuine caring individuals at Hotel Drisco, whose compassion and sensitivity quieted my anxiety and nurtured my soul. We will continue to return to the Hotel Drisco. When we depart we feel tranquil, fulfilled, and inspired to be better human beings in the world.

<Content>{ar Excellence! My business includes a fair amount of travel, and San Francisco, of course, rates high on the list of cities I call on. I am in San Francisco several times a year and the city is more inviting to me because I can stay at the Hotel Drisco.The Drisco is what I feel a real boutique hotel should be. Its located in an elegant residential neighborhood away from downtown, but not too far to be incovenient. Located in Pacific Heights overlooking the Bay it offers wonderful views and quiet streets, with some very charming shops and varied restaurants within walking distance.The decor is elegant and welcoming, really designed for comfort, and suggests a fine country inn. The staff are exceptionally well trained offering service equal to any of the most prestigious hotels I've ever visited,- comparable to the Four Season, the Ritz Carltons, here and abroad. Talking to other guests occasionally I find we are all enthusiasts and for the same reasons.The service leaves nothing to be desired, and everyone offers the same professional service with courtesy and a smile at all times.I really look forward to the few days I have at the Drisco. It lives up to the reputation San Francisco enjoys as a world class city. I feel its a world class hotel.

<Content>Terrible We booked this hotel based on reviews here but were very disappointed. This is not a hotel but really a guest house, B+B style place. If you like to feel looked after and comfortable then this is not the place for you. It is an old house so everything creaks, this may appear charming but at 4am in the monring if anyone moves it will be heard and wake you up. also the hotel has no air conditioning. Alot of houses in San Fran don't have air conditioning due to the cool weather but most hotels do. Even average hotels here in the UK will have air conditioning and its colder here than San Fran. So if you want some air you have to open the window which ensures you will be woken by the street noise, cars etc. The rooms are very small so they do get stuffy easily so you have to open the window.The location is also not great. Pacific Heights is a very nice suburb but it is not within walking distance to Union Sq or Fishermans wharf so you have to taxi everywhere. There is no taxi stop nearby so you have to ask the front desk to ring you a taxi every time you want to go somewhere. For a B+B guesthouse it would be of a good standard and the breakfast is very impressive in a lovely room, but it has hotel prices so is totally not worth it. We didn't see it until too late but the Lonely Planet calls it a drastically overpriced option.All the positive reviews here are from people who stayed in suites not a standard room.

<Content>Two Thumbs Up I HATE to write this review because I don't want this hotel to be overwhelmed with reservations. It is THE BEST VALUE in San Francisco, a VERY expensive city for hotels.Reservations: easy and efficient thru their website. They confirmed the reservation in record time.Check-in: fast efficient and accurate.Room: Large two room suite, with nice furniture, excellent lighting, and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was large and well appointed, with excellent towels and bath products.Amenities: Excellent breakfast included every morning, and wine in the late afternoon...a fantastic touch. You can get a pass for the Presidio YMCA for an excellent workout nearby.Other highlights: FREE IN-ROOM HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS. Abundant free on-street parking. An extremely quiet hotel location without any outside traffic noise. The neighborhood and the views are spectacular. Shopping and restaurants are nearby on Fillmore Street and Union Street.

<Content>Excellent hotel in an off the path location My girlfriend and I recently had a very pleasant two night stay at the Hotel Drisco. It's a cute and quiet hotel with hospitable service. The hotel is located in the Pacific Heights section of San Francisco, which is a beautiful neighborhood, but an out of the way location for most site seers. We'd stayed two nights at the Arognaut Hotel prior to the Hotel Drisco and we both liked its location much better. The Hotel Drisco is a fine hotel and I recommend it for the traveler who doesn't mind copious amounts of walking or taking a taxi. The room was extremely clean, the breakfast was good, and it was nice to change hotel locations to see other parts of San Francisco.A jog through the nearby Presidio Park makes for an excellent early morning run.Parking around the area is not as bad as I had read. Perhaps that is because we are used to the NYC parking problems and this was not even close.

<Content>Very Nice! Great staff! Bargain! What a nice, clean, well decorated hotel. The Hotel is off beaten path a little but is in a wonderful part of town. You are still very close to everything. Quick cab ride. We stayed in a suite which was very nice. Great views. The breakfast was very nice plenty to eat and great choices. The staff is great. We had no problems. Thanks,

<Content>Extremely Disappointed with El Drisco We chose El Drisco in San Francisco for it's reputation for service within a boutique hotel. However, after a 5 day visit we would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone to stay in. As a result of staff losing some of our posessions whilst there, we have never experienced such poor customer service from a supposed service-oriented hotel. Not only did the staff repeatedly ignore requests to help but nearly one month later neither we nor our insurance company have been able to even get a response from senior management. We visited the hotel to celebrate our anniversary. Whilst the loss of the property is in itself very unprofessional, it is the rudeness of the hotel to not even register our loss or complaint that has caused us to be so critical of this hotel. It is a great shame that the hotel has let itself down in this way. We had genuinely expected higher service.

<Content>Classy Hotel! We stayed in one of the suites in this hotel and were really impressed, it's not quite a 5 star hotel and there are little things that give that away (slight staining on the sofa for example) but it is a really classy place in a great location (albeit a long way from downtown San Francisco and the tourist traps of Fishermans Wharf) The continental breakfast is to be recommended with freshly squeezed orange juice.

<Content>Intimate, boutique,wonderful amenities I lived in San Franciso several years ago and have had the opportunity to stay in and visit a lot of the local hotels over the years. My family and I just stayed at the Drisco over the weekend of March 23, 2006. From the time of our arrival, the service was prompt and helpful. The check-in was courteous and efficient. The room was the two-bedroom and two-bath sutie. Large, spacious and comfortable. The living area and main bedroom had huge, gorgeous views overlooking the rooftops of the nearby Paciifc Heights mansions and the cityscape beyond. The sheets, bath linens and robes were wonderful and the bathrooms more than adequate. We had a generous sized fruit basket in our oom upon arrival, too.The Drisco is very close to the Pacific Heights, Union St. and Marina shopping districts but in a residential neighborhood...this means that the area right around the hotel is QUIET. If you are looking for nightlife within walking distance or close to Union Square, this is not the place to stay.

<Content>Echo - nice but no sleep Stayed at the Hotel Drisco on the advice from this board for two nights last week. The hotel is like a mini-Ritz Carlton in many ways - nice decor, nice amenities (Aveda products, comp water, good honor bar). Service was great - very nice and helpful. They paid for the cab in the AM when the car service was late and moved our rental car for us during the day (there is a 3hour limit for street parking).We picked the hotel for the relatively good value for the money and because it was said to be quiet.Location: Pacific Heights is beautiful and very near the Palace of Fine Arts, Presidio, Marina, etc. We had picked the hotel hoping to spend time in this part of the city and hoping for good weather. We got rain and ended up spending most of the time in Union Square/Fisherman's Wharf area which is not so convenient. Cabs are necessary or driving to get to these places.Complaints: Robes and towels were very scratchy. Radiator heat is VERY loud. I always wear earplugs when sleeping but my partner was awoken at 4:30AM both mornings by a terrible banging in the pipes. The location of the hotel is quiet - the hotel is not. The exercise room is closed - they did offer a free pass to the YMCA but we didn't use it.The hotel is nice, and a good value for the money, but we'd stay elsewhere next time bc of the noise. If it is going to be loud, we would rather be more centrally located.

<Content>Nice but no sleep My experience is based on a short stay during mid-week for a business trip.First of all the Pacific Heights area is really residential, quiet and old world elegant. There are many absolutely gorgeous homes in the surrounding area. One can see the water views standing on the street corner outside. With that said, if you are the typical tourist, it's really not that close to any touristy spots. I would venture to guess that Union Square is a good 25 minutes walk (up and down steep hills, btw), as is Fisherman's Pier. It's not convenient to any of the trolley stops either. There's a complimentary car service to Union Square in the morning, but the rest of the time you have to find your own transportation.The decoration of the room is tasteful and elegant. Very comfortable bed but very stiff robe and slippers for some reason (need fabric softener!). Secondly, I don't know if it's the location of my room, but starting from 6AM I can hear my neighbor walking in his room, getting ready in the morning. The floor board creaks mercilessly and sounded like a herd of elephants stampeding. Needless to say I got no sleep from that point on. Third, there is no central A/C or heat. A/C may not be a problem since S.F. doesn't get that hot in the summer, but the kicker is that when the radiator turned on at 7AM in the morning it gave out such loud pinging noises that I thought someone was doing remodeling work next door.The breakfast, although touted as gourmet, was nothing to write home about. It's the basic starch, plus boiled eggs, although set in a very elegant dining area.The service was outstanding. The receptionist was very helpful and friendly without being intrusive. I was impressed when they called and paid for a taxi cab ride when the complimentary ride was running late. I think in sum this is a great place if you want efficient and friendly service, great for a romantic weekend getaway but I would advise bringing your own car to get around town and a set of earplugs to handle the noise problems (due to the old building's infrastructure).

<Content>Extraordinary service at Hotel Drisco! I had been looking at small, upscale boutique hotels located in a quiet section of San Francisco. I had read some of the previous reviews and decided to try Hotel Drisco. It is worthy of all of the excellent reviews. The staff was more than helpful in every way. As I am a female traveling alone, I am very conscious of safety and security. The area is very safe and I felt secure at all times. The staff greeted me by name and always asked how I was doing. The amenities were also first rate. But the most impressive aspect of the hotel was the personalized service. All requests were met with a smile and without question from making restaurant reservations to small room repairs. One of the faucets in the bathroom was not functioning properly and I informed the front desk. I expected to have a washer replaced, but instead received a completely new faucet set. The breakfast that is provided was quite enough to satisfy my needs and very tasty. The only thing that people should be aware of is the only parking is on the street and is restricted during the day. I had no problem finding a space in the evening though. The Hotel Drisco was a great place and a great alternative to the large, somewhat impersonal hotels and I would stay there again without hesitation.

<Content>Outstanding Hotel! The Drisco Hotel was one of the highlights of our stay in San Francisco, despite a cold and rainy weekend. Our room was tastefully decorated, spotless, and comfortable. The breakfasts were delicious. The views from the hotel are breathtaking, and the location is excellent: walking distance to Presidio Park and to numerous fine restaurants and easy bus access to most points in the city. But what really makes this hotel so outstanding is the attitude of the staff. Everyone, from the front desk staff to the chamber maids, was cheerful, helpful, hospitable, and really gave new meaning to customer service. Most hotels refer to their customers as guests, but this hotel really treated us that way. We hope to return, and will recommend it to all our friends and family.

<Content>Excellent We stayed for 3 nights from 2-5 March inclusive. All the staff without exception were very hospitable, courtious and helpful. We had a suite and again this was a very good size, attractive and well maintained. The breakfast in the morning was very good and there was always plenty of everything. We would definitely stay again and would recommend it highly to anyone wanting to stay in a quieter but still close to everything environment.

<Content>Great boutique hotel The Drisco is the perfect boutique hotel located away from the major tourist thoroughfares, yet close to many great locations. The neighborhood is great and public transportation is close, so getting around was never a problem. The room was clean, comfortable, and had a great view of the city from the top of the hill. Our favorite thing about the Drisco was the friendly service, especially from Marti the concierge. The whole staff was very helpful and attentive to all our questions and requests.We also found the topical Joie de Vivre information sheets very helpful. We definitely recommend this hotel!

<Content>All our needs were met at the Drisco! We stayed at the Drisco for business in San Francisco. There was a large group of us and we had meetings scheduled in the hotel for several days. Gerard and his staff were most helpful and gracious. Every request was quickly taken care of, and all of the staff were warm, and professional. The loccation can't be beat - We all enjoyed the Pacific Heights neighborhood in our off hours and found it easy to get to ther parts of the city. I would stay at the Drisco again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Wonderful boutique hotel I chose the Hotel Drisco because I had often admired it while walking around the city in years past, and I hoped it would be the perfect base for my homecoming. I thought the hotel itself beautiful and charming, the breakfast buffet bountiful, and the evening wine hour a lovely touch. I also appreciated the Aveda toiletries, the CD player, excellent lighting in the bathroom, and the 24-hour coffee  tea in the parlor.  The hotel exceeded my expectations in all ways, but I was especially charmed by the warm welcome I received from the moment of my arrival. Every staff member I encountered was professional and gracious, and they helped to make my visit both memorable and wonderful. This hotel is perfect for those seeking a romantic getaway or a quiet home base from which to explore some of the areas of the city few tourists see.

<Content>Elegant Charm in San Francisco My husband and I actually live in San Francisco, but spent a few weekends a year at the Hotel Drisco.With it's outstanding upscale neighborhood location (Pacific Heights), it's the perfect spot for a relaxing getaway. And within walking distance to many locations including a fantastic view of the bay.The rooms are comfortable and chic, the bathrooms are luxurious marble. The complimentary breafast is a tranquil way to start your morning. Service is outstanding and the Hotel's Manager is thoughtful, professional, responsive and above all, charming.Needless to say - we'll be back again and again.

<Content>Exceptional boutique hotel with minor issues My fiance and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights over the x-mas holiday. Firts of all, the location is beautiful, nestled in the middle of Pacific Heights, which is essentially several square blocks of mostly older mini-mansions. Parking was never a problem right on the street alongside the hotel. At check-in, we were told we were upgraded to a junior suite at no additional charge, and we didn't even request one. The hotel is very antique-looking and charming, with creaky wooden floor planks and all. The free breakfast buffet was very good (fruits, cereals, toast, muffins and fresh squeezed o.j.) and the staff was great. We were treated to nightly turn-down service and the staff went out of their way to make our stay comfortable (bringing us a space heater when it got a little cold and calling taxis for us whenever needed). My only complaints are that there was some renovation going on during our stay and it was quite loud, but it was quiet at night and we were out all day sightseeing so it wasn't a huge factor. Also, our upgraded suite was on the dining room level, which is essentially underground, so we had absolutely no view. Other than that, it was very comfortable and a decent value for San Francisco.

<Content>Finest Hotel In San Francisco-An absolute gem My family and friends stayed at the Drisco for 3-4 days in November, attending a family event. We used 7 single rooms and a suite. All of our friends were raving about our selection of our headquarters hotel The rooms were elegant, the service first class, the amenities outstanding, the breakfast more than we could eat and the manager, front desk and housekeeping staff were extremely helpful and accommodating, meeting all our requests. I would recommend the Drisco without any hesitation. For my money, the top hotel in San Francisco in a great, quiet neighborhood.

<Content>The most wonderful place! My husband and I spent four nights at the Drisco the first week of October.What a wonderful hotel! Everything was just beautiful. We had a suite with a king size bed, a large bathroom, and the most stunning views from the many windows.The most delightful thing was to come in the evening and not to have lift a finger. The bed is already turned down, the shades pulled, and delicious cookies await you. Ice is left in a bucket, so you don't even have to get it yourself. The hotel is spotless, and parking is plentiful is this residential neighbourhood. The breakfast buffet is very generous and the display of food very elegant. We wanted to stay an extra night, even at the cost of paying a penalty to change our airline tickets, but to our regret the hotel was full.Thank you El Drisco for wonderful memories!

<Content>Quiet location! At the last minute before we left for our trip to San Francisco, I changed our hotel from downtown to the Hotel Drisco. We really liked the location of the hotel. It was so much quieter and felt safer than downtown. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms are smallish but clean and feel posh. There are restaurants and bars on Fillmore street within walking distance and downtown is only a few minutes away by cab or car. I would reccommend this hotel. Very nice.

<Content>A Gem! in already a wonderful city If you are looking for a quiet  lovely hidaway from the hustle  bustle usually found in a big city, this is your hotel. Beautifully appointed rooms with fabulous admenities. Quiet nieghborhood within walking distance to quaint little shops and delicous restaurants nearby. My fiance' and I loved it so much we are spending our first honeymoon night there. The front desk staff was brillantly helpful. And because of their recommendation we found the prefect location to host our wedding reception dinner.Rooms are uniquely restored in up holding the old fashion glamour known of its time.

<Content>Loved the Drisco! Our stay at the Hotel Drisco was one of the highlights of our recent trip to San Francisco. Our room was very comfortable, spacious and beautifully decorated. We loved the delicious buffet breakfast in the sunny dining room every morning. The staff were very helpful and attentive. Most importantly, because the Drisco is in a residential neighbourhood, it's very quiet at night which we really appreciated. We hope to visit SF again soon and would definitely stay at the Hotel Drisco.

We were treated wonderfully at this small, charming hotel in a great, walkable neighborhood. The staff excels at making one feel at home and well-cared for (even with a bouncy child). They deserve all the praise they get and a repeat clientele.

<Content>Great find in the Pacific Heights We were encouraged by friends who live in SF to try the Hotel Drisco and we were not disappointed. My husband and I have been coming to SF for 27 years and we have stayed in many premier properties but this was our first time in the Pacific Heights area. If you want to be near downtown and Union Square, this is not the place for you although the Drisco offers free morning shuttles to downtown. We loved the ambience, the view, the size of the room, the personal attention and the quietness of this charming jewel of a hotel in a beautiful residential setting. The service is friendly and attentive in this small luxury hotel without being presumptuous. We will definitely go back!

<Content>we left our hearts at The Drisco! I had high hopes for our trip to San Francisco and staying at the Drisco ensured a wonderful trip. From my first contact with the staff to make our reservation, everything went incredibly smoothly. The staff is exceptional, always willing to go the extra step. They are professional yet friendly and if they can't answer a question immediately they will find the answer quickly. The actual number of staff is also impressive. The hotel is located in a magnificent area in SF and while it is not in the center of all the action, the view from the hills of Pacific Heights is far more exciting. The hills are rigorous but we also had a car and we had no trouble parking. You do have to move the car every three hours but the staff offered to do it for us if we weren't around! We had no trouble getting a cab as the hotel called them for us and they were there within 10 minutes. You are also near the Fillmore Street and Chestnut Street shopping areas which are a lot of fun. Our family stayed in a lovely two bedroom city view suite, which gave us ample room and stunning views. The bathrooms are large and well appointed. The continental breakfast and wine and cheese hour included for all guests makes the Drisco even more special and affordable. The dining room and sitting rooms are quite comfortable and inviting. We stayed a week and were extremely happy and would not even think of staying anyplace else when we return to SF.

<Content>Wow! Stayed here with my wife and kids for 4 days before going down the southern coast. The hotel and location was magnificent and hands down the best in SF. However, it is not for everyone, especially those not fond of walking up and down hills. We returned only a few days later because we enjoyed it so much. The Pacific Heights neighborhood can't be beat, nor can the mansions which are stunning.The hotel and its staff are graceful and terrific. The rooms are very nice, especially the suites which is where we stayed in. I saw further down in the reviews that people complained of no a/c in the rooms. Hello...you don't need a/c is SF.

<Content>Its Not For Everyone But This Is Where I Want To Spend My Last Waking Days!! Its off the beaten path. There are no bells and whistles. You have to walk up and down an Everest-ian hill every time you want to eat. Good luck getting a cab (but if you walk a few blocks you can catch a bus downtown...) Despite some quirks this is my favorite hotel in the United States. Its all about location, baby, and you cant do much better than this. All around you are $10 million houses and there's no better place to play pretend-you-are-a-rich San Franciscan than here. If you get the right room (always book a suite) the views are heavenly and the room sizes are very acceptable. I love nothing more than coming here with my wife on a cold, rainy weekend and spending the majority of our time in the room. The staff have all been here forever and while understated they are helpful and extremely competent. They serve a nice breakfast in their basement with fresh juice and decent pastries. If you want something garish, stay at the Mandarin. If you want the quinessential San Francisco experience, stay at the Drisco.

<Content>view of the City My wife and I flew to San Francisco and wanted a Hotel removed from the hectic pace of the city while still being close to all the great places to see in San Francisco. We checked into the Hotel Drisco and received a warm greeting from the Staff. We were given a beautiful room overlooking the City of S.F. with a view that was spectacular in the evening when all the lights of the City were lit. The room was first class and the staff was very efficient and courteous. We would highly reccommend the Hotel Drisco to anyone wishing to have a relaxed and pleasant stay and a feeling of being wanted. The excellent buffet breakfast and the wine tasting hour in the late afternoon are just some of the many plusses you receive when you stay at this very elegant small hotel. My wife and I look forward to staying here on our next trip to San Francisco.

<Content>Can't say enough good things... What a treat! We came to San Francisco on our way to Carmel for our honeymoon. We were there for one night. This place is top notch. It is considered 3.5 stars but we felt like we were at a 5 star hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful, like we were family. They upgraded us to a suite and it was over the top. The bellman was experienced, graceful and very accommodating. The rooms were clean, beautifully decorated with every attention to detail. Any request we had was met promptly and with class. We stayed at a 5 Star in Carmel Valley and after the El Drisco, we were so spoiled! It didn't hold a candle to El Drisco.Excellent location away from the chaotic city down the hill. If you like walking, the neighborhood has the most beautiful homes. Caution..lots of steep grade hills so don't attempt if you aren't in decent shape. We will stay here again.

<Content>Our Secret Hideaway El Drisco is one of the best kept secrets in San Francisco! My wife and I enjoyed a Pacific Suite. The room is as luxurious as the pictures indicate. Breakfast is a special treat in a confortable dining room. Wine in the parlor before dinner.We had a brief two days to see San Francisco. The staff was especially helpful. Marti, the Concierge, looked after our car for a day and made numerous arrangements for dinners and a play. Taxi's were promptly arranged when needed.In the AM, we took a walking tour with a Golden Gate Greeter that was especially helpful in getting to know the area and its transportation. The facility itself is very charming with sqeaky floors! It was built early 1900's. Located in a very quiet upscale neighborhood at the top of the city!

<Content>Family stay at the Drisco My wife and I and our two small girls stayed for three nights at the Drisco. We had a large room with sitting area which turned into a family room very easily. The decorations in the room were lovely and we had a pleasant view from the window (although you can only see the tip of golden gate bridge because new buildings obscure the view). The childrens bed was a pull down sofa and seemd a little uncomfortable but they didnt seem to notice. The main bed was excelent. Breakfast was delightful: a host of delicious itmes served buffet style with an eye for healthy eating. The position of the Drisco is ideal for anyone interested in being out of the hustle and bustle of the city, but within easy reach of all attractions. We hired bikes down the hill and cycled over the golden gate which was great. There are some nice restaurants a few blocks walk away and its a short taxi ride or bus ride into downtown or fishermans wharf.The staff were all very friendly and the early evening free wine and biscuits is a nice touch.The hotel has the feel of a small friendly country hotel with enough luxury to make you feel special without feeling opulent. All this however comes at a price. We paid $600 for three nights. If you can afford it its a treat worth having. if your on a budget go elsewhere.

<Content>Refuge from the city My wife and I stayed here for a week on our honeymoon. After navigating the complicated streets of downtown San Francisco (ie: Market Street), we arrived at the hotel ready for a break from the day of travel. Check in was simple and the staff was courteous and helpful. Although they don't have room service for meals and there isn't a restaurant around for blocks for a quick meal, the front desk offered menus to places who would deliver within an hour. The restaurant we ordered from wasn't magnificent by any means, but it beat trying to find a restaurant after only 1 hour in the city for the first time. Honestly, I was ready to leave San Francisco and we had only been there for 1-2 hours!!! Luckily, after winding down in a very quiet room with a city view, windows open with a cool breeze, and an extremely comfortable bed with enough covers to keep you warm through a blizzard, the next morning was a new day! Maps are essential if you have never been to S.F. We had a rental car and although parking was terrible in the city, at the hotel, parking was a breeze! Only a few steps away from the hotel and never had to pay. (Best parking is on Broderick St. towards Broadway or Jackson). Even if you plan to leave the hotel and use the MUNI system during the day, the hotel staff will move your car for you every 2-hours to avoid a ticket. This was nice! Check out CITYPASS for great deals in San Francisco.For the best rate after getting on-line quotes, I called the hotel to see if they could do better. Their rate was cheaper than any online site and I didn't have to mention a quoted price. Since we don't drink and there was complimentary champagne for our honeymoon, the staff substituted another drink in its place which was really nice. The buffet breakfast was a blessing each morning from 7AM to 10AM. Ice and cookies are served to the room each day around 5:30PM which my wife and I looked forward to when we got back each day from the city. Several changes/improvements we would recommend.... 1. Offer heat in the bedroom, even during the summer. It can get cold, even with the windows shut. (They do offer to turn it on for you, but we didn't see the need or trouble for them to do so just to get warm). 2. A more consistent staff meaning same faces, same place. What I mean by this is the front desk seemed to have a different person working it every time we passed throughout the week. This in no way hindered service and all were nice, but it's good to be consistent. 3. And lastly, more water pressure in the tub/shower. It was enough to get by, but we like a little more pressure.Located in a very quiet neighborhood, easy parking, great views, and a charm found only in select places, we recommend Hotel Drisco to others and plan on staying here for future visits.

<Content>Great boutique hotel We stayed at the Drisco for 4 nights at the end of May, it was a stop over from our honeymoon in Hawaii back home to England. Overall the hotel was great.The hotel is in a lovely area of San Francisco - Pacific Heights and after spending a few days exploring San Francisco we realised that it was the only location for us. Its very quiet and a nice escape from the hussle and bustle of the city. We had a deluxe room with a city view which was great, big bathroom, very clean immaculate bedroom. Now I understand from what they said that there are only a few of these deluxe rooms with the city views, the other deluxe ones don't have such great views. So if you book a deluxe room ask for one of these.The hotel is on top of the hill so we either caught a cab or sometimes walked up...which certainly kept us fit!! The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to Fremont street which was great in the evenings when looking for a restaurant. The concierge service was great and very helpful and arranged a chaffeur driven car for half a day to take us to Muir woods (wow!!) and Sausilito - all for $55 an hour! . We also liked the complimentary drink for all the guests between 5 and 7..it was nice to meet and chat to the other guests.The things that could be improved upon were that the hotel served no food except a buffet at breakfast, upon our arrival being asked to call from our room for a takeway and not use the reception phone (although we could eat it in the dining room) which we found a little crazy and the shower was quite weak. Overall if we go to San Francisco again we would stay at the Drisco

<Content>If you want to stay here, get a suite! I just wanted to add my two cents. My wife and I purchased three nights at the Drisco from one of the luxury deal Web sites and stayed there in late October-early November of 2004. We had a suite with an unobstructed view looking southward -- nothing particularly spectacular, but still quite nice in that it gave the room a very airy feel. And the room itself was drop-dead gorgeous, just like the photos they publish on the Web site. It was very clean (and the hotel cleaning staff were very nice too), and we felt quite taken care of there. The breakfast was wonderful, probably the epitome of continental breakfast -- everything was fresh, and the atmosphere was first-rate. The front desk staff was a little hit or miss -- sometimes imperious, other times very accommodating -- but that was a minor quibble. It was so nice to be away from the downtown noise; the early morning hours there were downright serene. As another reviewer mentioned, parking is hard to find, but it's not impossible.One thing I'm picking up from all the other reviews -- if you're going to stay here, you probably need to get a suite. There are a few horror stories among the reviews, and it seems like all these bad stories come from those who didn't have a suite.If we can afford it or find another deal, we'll definitely be staying at the Drisco the next time we go to San Francisco. The hotel itself was one of the high points of our trip.

<Content>Beautiful Experience The location of this hotel and the warm friendly service are a perfect match. High atop Pacific Heights, a beautiful neighborhood. Do not be phased by the hilltop location. Once you're there it's a charming walk to Palace of Fine Arts, Marina, Presidio, Union Street or Fillmore Street shops and restaurants. Why stay in a touristy location like Union Square, when you can be part of the city in a safe and quiet locale? Hotel service was superb. Breakfasts healthy and delicious! Was not disappointed in the Deluxe Room given for the $175/night, 3-night special package--very nice room, exceptional for the price. Parking on the weekends absolutely no problem near the hotel if you can walk one steep block. Since everything is in a downhill direction from the hotel, really enjoyed the cheap and frequent Muni ride home at the end of an active day (also one uphill block to walk home to hotel).

<Content>Did I Miss Something? We spent 4 nights at the Drisco in early March, which was 3 nights too many for us. I'll try to keep my comments brief. We had stayed at a terrific boutique downtown hotel (the same chain) the previous 4 nights and really looked forward to a change of atmosphere in a residential neighborhood - and boy did we get one. The room was booked directly through the hotel website. We were given a hot, dark room on the 3rd floor overlooking an interior courtyard - the spectacular Pacific Heights views we anticipated were nonexistent unless we hung out in the hallway or on the roof. Through the window, we were in earshot of every noise from other hotel rooms and the adjacent apartment building - frankly, I prefer street noise to flushing toilets, baby crying, coughing, sneezing, and various other bodily functions. We had no fan and no AC, and the room was ridiculously hot even though it was 55-65 degrees outside every day. The bed was like a rock. Yes, the room was pretty and the bathroom was large, but who wanted to spend any time in a hot, dark, loud room? Strangely, every other room on our floor had a theme name posted on the door - ours didn't - and I don't think they would take my suggestion for a name. Front desk hotel staff were aloof. They promptly reminded us that the rewards program we signed up for on the chain's website does not include this hotel; I guess I should have read the fine print. The continental breakfast they serve is on par with any other chain, nothing spectacular, and we felt rushed by the busboys. The business center, while comprehensive, charges you $4 for every 20 minutes of computer time and $0.20 per page to print. I felt nickel-and-dimed, especially since the downtown hotel we had just checked out of included these services at no charge.Pacific Heights has lovely homes and unparalleled city views, but be forewarned: parking is nonexistent on weekdays (resident permits only). Restaurants and shopping on Fillmore and Union Streets are not far to walk to as the crow flies, especailly since they are downhill. However, the return trip is a strenuous, extremely steep climb up a 300' hill. Bus routes are at the bottom of the hill, so be prepared to seriously exert yourself every day. None of this is the Drisco's fault - but it would be nice if they offered some sort of shuttle service. Speaking of shuttles - if you book any bus tours from the Fisherman's Wharf area, they will not pick you up or return you to the Drisco since the hotel is far from the downtown area and situated on the hill. Bottom line: bring money for taxis.Perhaps the Drisco would be OK for a one night stay to see the Pacific Heights neighborhood, but next time I will remain downtown.

<Content>Slightly Disappointed in Hotel Drisco We just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Drisco. The hotel is very nice and is in a nice neighborhood. Parking is not difficult to find, but be aware that there is only a 3 hour limit on parking anywhere near the hotel without a permit which the hotel does not provide. The bellhop was nice enough to move our car for us when we were gone all day. Initially we got our room for $195 from hotels, when we arrived we were dissappointed to find out that this is for the very least desirable room on the basement floor of the hotel. The room was tiny and it was very hot that day and this hotel does not have air conditioning. Be aware that these rooms look absolutely nothing like the ones in the brochure or the website. We did upgrade to a suite which was very nice and comparable to the pictures on the website. But we did have to pay an additional $70 (they tried to charge us an additional $139/night). The service was very good and the bellhop and maids were very nice. There was one particular person at the front desk who was very stuffy and not welcoming to us. The breakfast was very average. Probably would not stay here again but the suite was very nice.

<Content>A great bargain in a different part of the city Recently stayed at the Hotel Drisco and overall enjoyed our experience. The city view suite was lovely and the hotel has many lovely amenities ie. Frette robes/bed linens, cookies with turndown, high end bath products. The windows actually open and the staff were very helpful. Staying in Pacific Heights offered us a very different experience of San Francisco, allowing visits to Union St., The Presidio, Golden Gate Park as well as just walking around the beautiful houses in Pacific Heights. This is not a place for the physically disabled, as walking is essential and often difficult. Although we did not have a car, if you are unable or unwilling to walk, this hotel would not be a good fit. However, it allowed us to eat very well, get some great exercise, see part of the city we wouldn't have seen and never gain an ounce. The breakfast consisted of cereals, scones, croissants, hard boiled eggs. The things which could be improved upon are pretty picky, but would include better soundproofing on the hall doors, new carpets, more consistent housekeeping. This is not Campton Place, but still a lovely hotel in an equally lovely part of town.

<Content>Amazing hotel, amazing value, easy parking What an amazing hotel and what an amazing value! For less than what you'd pay for a room at the boring hotels around Union Square, we had a luxurious suite with views of the Golden Gate, Coit Tower, and Alcatraz. The service was superb and the breakfasts were fabulous. We had been worried, when we booked, about finding parking on the street. Don't worry! There's no problem finding parking. We never had to park more than a block away. You will be very happy if you stay at the Drisco. I promise you. It looks as if this sentiment is unanimous.

<Content>Adorable Boutique Hotel We loved Hotel Drisco. It is a boutique hotel in a gorgeous area of San Francisco. We stayed in a Deluxe King room. The continental breakfast was great. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you're visiting San Francisco. We celebrated our 1st year anniversary there. We wouldn't have changed a thing :o) You will totally enjoy your stay.

<Content>A fabulous jewel A fabulous boutique hotel in a neighborhood with spectacular views of the city....we came for my 50th birthday and were upgraded to a city suite that was more memorable and charming than that of my honeymoon. We actually cancelled another reservation on our way back from Monterey Peninsula to stay here again.

<Content>Drisco is Wonderful! The Hotel Drisco is very attractive, comfortable, spacious and includes LOADS of amenities for free. Breakfast, wine and hors d'oeuvres, high speed internet in the room, all included. The rooms are very reasonably priced and the staff is well informed and friendly. For a stay in the Pacific Heights area, this may be the best. I happen to prefer this location to downtown.
