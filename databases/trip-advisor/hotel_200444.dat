<Content>decent hotel, not too central but handy for Schoenefeld airport We stayed in Park Hotel Blub in Berlin over Easter last year and found it clean and calm. Overall a good mid-range hotel.The hotel was only 5 min walk from the underground, although something more central would have made the evening/night journey back to the hotel a bit easier.

<Content>Not Bad Not a bad hotel for the price. The rooms are clean and modern. The furnishings are a little sparse but not bad. The biggest downside to this hotel is the location. It is located near a U Bahn stop but in bad weather dragging luggage all of a sudden it does not seem so close.Once you reach the U it is about a 30 minute ride to get in town. For the same price or slighly more it is possible you can find the same caliber lodging closer in. If you need somewhere to stay in that area of Berlin I would recommend it.

<Content>One of the best hotels we've stayed in We stayed at Blub for 5 days. It is somewhat off the beaten track in regards to being at the centre of Berlin but it was easily reached by taxi from the airport. We found no problems using public transport and if anything enjoyed ourselves more as we actually saw lots more of Berlin then if everything was on our doorstep. Public transport was amazingly efficient and very reasonably priced and easy to use. The hotel room was pristine and surpassed our expectations, we had only paid about 拢30 per night! It was so good that we kept thinking they were going to say that we'd underpaid and try and charge us more, but they didn't - I would highly recommend having a look online for cheap rooms like we did, we saved about 拢60 a night. The food was amazing, little bit pricey as it was a la carte but worth it if you want a treat. The staff were all very helpful and always asked about our day. the bar area and restaurant were always spotless.I would recommend this hotel for anyone who is interested in the historical and cultural aspects of Berlin as it was far enough away from the city centre to be cheap but near enough to Grenzalle underground to be accessible to pretty much eveything. One last thing when in Berlin you MUST try Berliner Weissbier mit Schuss, it's pale wheat beer with a shot of either raspberry or something green that the barlady didn't know the english for! It is absolutely amazing, not a big beer fan but have been scouring shops for it in england, nothing comes close.

<Content>Good place to stay if attending conference / exhibition at Estrel Hotel At 75 euro per night including a very good breakfast the Park Hotel Blub is a good option for anyone attending a conference or exhibition at the Estrel Hotel  Convention centre, where accomodation is more than twice as much. The hotel itself is clean, rooms are good size although not all have air con. Breakfast very good. There's a bus stop right outside which is only 5 stops away from the Estrel with only a short walk at the other end, costs only 1 euro 30. It's also very close to Schoenefeld airport, only 10 / 15mins away, about 20 euro in taxi.

<Content>Excellent value, convenient location I stayed at this hotel after 2 nights at Residence Chatillon in Paris, which was a typical Parisian dump disguised as a hotel. So my positive view about Park Hotel Blub Berlin may have been enhanced by an immediate past negative experience.The hotel is on a bus route directly to and from Berlin Schoenefeld (if I recall correctly, it is route 171). The U Bahn station is about 5 minutes walk away. If you are going to catch a train anywhere, it is very convenient.The staff at the hotel were friendly and efficient. The hotel reception was not fancy, but functional and simple. The room was clean. The bathroom was very nice and clean also. There aren't too many restaurants around the area, but there are a few small places for food. The area around the hotel is not the best part of Berlin. It looks a bit run down, but it did not appear to be unsafe.WiFi access is not free. It costs EUR 15 per day. The connection speed was quite good.

<Content>Not the best, keep looking and you'll find better The hotel is located about a seven minute walk from the Grenzalee stop on the U-Bahn. It's in a not-so-great area of town that looks seedy and there are few other businesses around for visitors. You are several stops from the city center.The rooms are nice, clean enough and the beds are okay. The staff were okay. Many were helpful when asking where to go for dinner/shopping/etc. The manager of the hotel was rude. They messed up our reservation; it was made for three people and they made it for two. The hotel said breakfast was included and then told us when we got there that it was 12 Euros per person. It is not worth 12 Euros! They barely clear the tables there so we had problems even finding an unsoiled table to sit at for breakfast. What we can't understand is that we have about a dozen or more rooms at this silly hotel and half INCLUDE breakfast and the other half do not.... All without explanation. These rooms are all the same. My work paid for this room aside from a day I extended. If it were my dime I would not stay here again. Stay somewhere with a better breakfast and a nicer manager.

<Content>Good hotel, shame about the location We liked this hotel and I would stay there again...if it was closer to the centre. The room was big, beds were comfortable, bathroom was modern and clean. Good business hotel, especially for the price. It had a carpark, so I would possibly stay there if using Berlin as a base for exploring that area of Germany.However, the location is too far out of the centre of Berlin. It is only a 5min walk to the underground station and a few stops to the centre (20mins), but it took us an hour to reach particular locations within the city. Berlin is a big city and it can take a while (despite excellent and efficient public transport) to reach places in the east and west without having the extra 20 minute journey into the city.

<Content>Quite nice for the price but slighly off the path I went to Berlin with my wife and some friends in Aug 2007 and stayed for 4 nights. To start with, this hotel is quite close to the Schonefeld airport - There is a direct bus to the hotel or we can take a train and then a bus. For anyone coming into Berlin by train this hotel is quite a distance from the main station (around 1.5 hours).The hotel is a good 7-10 mins walk from the underground metro station but its on the main road and it seemed a decent enough place so we were not worried to come in late at night. There are good cafes near the underground station which was convenient for breakfast. We arrived quite early in the morning but we were offered the room immediately even though the check in time was around 12. The staff were quite friendly and ready to answer any questions (in english). Our room was very very nice for the price we paid - with AC/Minibar/TV/big bath. But note that our friends who booked after us had a room with no Air conditioning and it was quite uncomfortable for them. I think the newer blocks have A/C and they allot this first so booking early might ensure this.Overall our experience was quite good... but do ensure you get a room with A/C during summer.

<Content>Good budget hotel - but check a/c or room location if light sleeper! My wife and I are on a 4 month flash packing trip around Europe and the Americas and we were looking for good budget accomodationModern hotel is a 5min walk from U-bahn station (Grenzalle, U7) and an awesome location for Schonefeld or Templehof Airports. It is about 20 - 30 mins to central berlin locations with 1 / 2 changes (usually very easy).Room was big (with very comfortable beds), staff friendly, spoke great english, wi-fi available in lounge (was free although ads in hotel suggested it had to be paid for). Also a central safe with own key.Only downside was the lack of a/c, which meant had to sleep with windows open onto a reasonably busy main road (fine for us as we are heavy sleepers).But at 拢26 per night through expedia, we can't really complain!Note, hotel breakfast is expensive, just pop up the road to the italian! Also restaurants nearby, inlcuding the greek all fine if you don't facny / need a trip to central Berlin

<Content>Excellent Value for Money I stayed here for 3 nights - July 26, 27 and 28. I was given an apartment room. It was located in the building next to the hotel. The room was BIG and clean with a nice bathroom and balcony. The room also had a small kitchen area. The breakfast was excellent. However the room did not have any ariconditioning....it was however not a problem as the weather was very pleasant during my stay. The wireless broadband connectivity was very weak in the room. You have to be seated in the lobby if you want the connectivity to be good.

<Content>Recommend to All Me and my boyfriend had an amazing stay at this hotel, it was a few minute walk from the grenzallie U-bahn, there is also two shops right beside the hotel that sell food and drink, plus a few restarants along the same road. the rooms where spotless and where cleaned everyday, the fact there was no air conditioning was not a problem when we stayed in june, we spent most of our day sightseeing. I read a few bad reviews on trip advisor about this hotel but this hotel was nothing like it was described. It was excellent. It was a great place to stay for our 7 day stay in berlin, it was only a 10 minute train journey from all the major sites. the U-bahn is so easy to use, you will have no problem getting about.Berlin is an amazing city and this is a great place to stay A++++

<Content>Excellent value I stayed with my girlfriend here for four nights in May. We had flown into Schonefeld, so this hotel was easily accessible by bus or the S/U-Bahn, even late at night. Our room was two single beds next to one another, with a bath and shower ensuite. The room was immaculately clean and was quite spacious. All the hotel staff we spoke to spoke English, and were very helpful. Breakfast was 12 Euro per person if its not included, we didn't have breakfast here and we didn't see the size of the portions, however there is a small cafe opposite Grenzallee U-Bahn station (the nearest station) that sells a huge continental type breakfast for 4 Euro. This is ideal as you'd be going that way if you're going anywhere by U/S-Bahn. As an aside there is a restaurant between the hotel and Grenzallee station, which has a large pizza/steaks etc sign outside (you couldn't miss it), which does food amazingly cheap (ie. 1.5 Euro for soup starter, 4 Euro for a pasta main course). The food was great here, mind out for the 3.50 Euro coke there though.In summary, the hotel was excellent, the location was good (although on a map it looks way out of the city centre it is a five minute walk to Grenzallee U-bahn station which connects you with the city centre), but the best bit was the price. It only cost us 拢120 in total, which for the standard of hotel I thought was amazing. I would definately stay here if I went back to Berlin.

<Content>Excellent value, too far from Berlin City This hotel is excellent apart from the distance from Berlin. I booked a standard single room for 拢27 per night through Expedia. This included breakfast which was of excellent quality with a wide variety of food to choose from.The room itself was a fair size and was clean and modern, with a nice sized television.Wi-fi in the lobby is free of charge - a big big bonus for me as too often I get ripped off with high fees.The only snag with the Blub it is its distance from Berlin Centre. It took us at least 25 minutes on the underground and involves two to three changes, depending on where in Berlin you need to be. But, on the whole, taking in to account price and quality, if you don't mind the distance to Berlin or prefer to stay in the suburbs, I couldn't complain.

<Content>Okay, but some problems Room okay, but when it says a standard double room, it means two single beds pushed together with separate duvets! Not what you expect when you pay for something that says Standard double room!Would not recommend this hotel for the reasons below:We had an item stolen from our hotel room. When we complained to staff about this, it was not taken seriously. We then couldn't let the maid in to do any further cleaning during our stay. Generally felt unconfortable with situation, and our feelings not taken into account seriously enough by manager of hotel (a couple of staff were quite nice and friendly there though). Other receptionists were not very cheerful or friendly either.Hotel literally in the middle of nowhere - it was at least 20 minutes walk to nearest station, in an isolated and dark area at night - hardly any shops or restaurants nearby!Would not recommend this hotel as found it unacceptable and not very good at customer serivce.

<Content>Good value for money We chose this hotel mainly for the location, driving from the East towards Berlin you can get here direct from the highway and then you are just 5 minutes walk from the nearest metro. Hotel is very modern, rooms basic but clean and tidy, reception was very helpful. Great choice of hot and cold food for breakfast even when we turned up at 10.30 one morning. Would recommend it, especially to Budget travellers, we paid only 75 euros a night.

<Content>Not centrally located but an excellent price. This hotel is about four blocks from the metro. The rooms are small but clean. And the price was $40 euros a night. Definitly no more than two people per room. Parking was $6 euros a day, and breakfast was $7 euros with a coupon. The rooms do not have airconditioning so I wouldn't recommend staying here in the middle of summer. The bathrooms are a fairly good size but the showers are small, which is weird since there was definitely room to make a larger shower. This hotel is closer to Schonefield and Templehof Airports. The autobahn is about five blocks from this hotel.

<Content>Nice, but with some issues Initially, we were excited to stay in a 4* hotel, but when we arrived we quickly found out there was NO air conditioning in this hotel. The rooms were very nice and spacious, but sweltering in the middle of July. Our room was on the ground floor and when we opened the curtains we were literally 3 feet away from the atrium restaurant. Basically we could hear people's conversations while they were eating breakfast and we couldn't shut the windows because it was so hot. There was VERY little air flow and the fact that anyone could peek in at anytime from the restaurant was very disturbing. This hotel is no where near city center but is about a 5 minute walk to the nearest tube stop. The staff is very friendly, speaks great English and is willing to help. We were glad to pay the rate we did, but I think we could've found better accomodation elsewhere.

<Content>Excellent hotel for the money Hotel blub is clean, modern looking and nicely appointed on the inside and out. Rooms were huge, with very comfortable beds which had duvets. Two windows in the room, nice shower, nice drapes. Location is a little out from the centre of the city, but its about a 3 minute walk to the Grenzallee U-Bahn station, and takes about 10 minutes to get to Alexanderplatz by U-Bahn. Paid about 40 euros a night with taxes included booked on Expedia, and was one of the better hotels I've stayed in. I would say it is a 3.5 star hotel compared to others I've seen. Ideal hotel for those visiting Berlin who don't have to be very close to the main sights, and especially those on a budget, as I believe this hotel worked out to be cheaper than staying in a hostel. The only gripe I had was that some of the receptionists seemed slightly surly but then again so are most Berliners. What an excellent deal on a great hotel. Would recommend to anyone.

<Content>Good Hotel This hotel was a good find, for the price we paid, you couldn't really ask for more! The room was a bit basic, but it was probably becasue we opted for standard rather than the more expensive option as we were on a budget. The room was very clean and the beds very comfortable.The hotel is not in central Berlin , but Grenzallee U-Bahn, and a bus stop are about a 5-10 walk away and goes to many of the busier areas.We didn't get to try the pool complex near by as they were renovating it...you can try the sauna though, but be aware that it is mixed and naked!?!I would stay here again as I am not too fussy about being in the centre, the public transport is so cheap that it was no hassle at all! If you want to stay in central Berlin, this probably is not the right hotel for you, but of you want somewhere that is cheap and cheerful and a very nice hotel then I would definately recommend it!

<Content>Excellent value The primary reason we picked this hotel was for the price, and it was very good value indeed for the money.The hotel is situated 5 mins walk from the Grenzallee U-Bahn stop, which gives easy access to central Berlin.The hotel room was basic, but spotlessly clean. The beds were comfy and we were not kept awake by noise. The staff on reception were very polite and friendly (and spoke English, thankfully!)There's no denying that the hotel is not in a central area, or even a very busy area - but if price is the overriding concern and you intend to make full use of the U-Bahn then you will not go far wrong here.

<Content>Excellent value for money! We stayed at this hotel in August and were also put in the apartment block across from the hotel. The room was enormous for a hotel, the beds were wonderfully comfortable, and the bathroom was very clean (and everything was white!). Unfortunately, the breakfast was not included and we had to pay 6 Euros a day for parking. Although another user claimed that you need a car to get around Berlin if you stay at this hotel, I disagree. The Grenzallee U-Bahn stop was only a five minute walk from the hotel, and this went directly into the city. The U-Bahn runs frequently through this stop. I will definetly stay here again if I return to Berlin!
