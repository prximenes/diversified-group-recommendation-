<Content>Noisy Hotel  We stayed at the Embassy Suites on the before and after leg of a 7 day cruise.... 2 different rooms. The views from our rooms were horrible and the hotel is a few blocks from the beach. The 8 story echoing atrium is not at all condusive to the live loud playing bands they host every Fri  Sat night. Don't stay here if you want to sleep before 12 AM because the sounds reverberate throughout the entire property. I called to complain but the night desk manager didn't seem to care that I paid over $300/nt (incl taxes). They were more sympathic to the 5 people listening to the band. Even worse, each night my wife and I scratched from what I believe were bed bugs. Yet, we didn't itch at all during our 7 day cruise. The room had an odd stench that is consistent with that of bed bug infestation. The free morning breakfasts and afternoon happy hour was nice but not at the expense of basic accommodations.

<Content>PreCruise Hotel - Good, not great Stayed one night at the Embassy Suites (Carolina) near the San Juan international airport prior to leaving on the Carnival Victory and a southern caribbean cruise.Traveling from California, we had to leave at 6am Pacific time and not arrive in PR via Dallas until 10pm PR time. By the time we got to the Embassy Suites, all the restaurants were closed despite the website indicating that the Outback steakhouse would be open until 2am. The manager said that only the bar was ever open that late. When I informed him of the error in the hotel's website, he seemed to care less. I would hope they would correct this information because on the cab ride to the hotel, the cabbie offered to pull into a fast food place and get my family food (two very young, starving kids plus 4 exhausted adults). Instead, I opted to trust the hotel website and it was wrong.Secondly, we arrived to a virtual Calypso concert in the hotel lobby - so loud it was hard to hear the clerk at the check in desk. Apparently at least one wedding and one 50 year wedding anniversary were being celebrated. It was mid-night. No one could tell me when the party would end. We were tired and hungry and it didnt seem that rest nor food was going to come anytime soon. This is not what I signed up for.Had to take a cab 6 blocks to a very busy Chilis for dinner. They took an hour to make 5 sandwiches. Got back to the hotel at 130am with music still blaring. still no clue when the party would end. The room was able to void out most of the noise and my 1 year old was able to fall asleep with ease. Room was typical Embassy Suites - clean and comfortable. Breakfast bar was extremely busy and hard to find a table. Buffet line for made to order breakfast was a joke so I opted for precooked eggs, bacon, etc which was just fine and very fresh. otehr choices included tropical fruits, oatmeal, cereals, breads, coffee, milk, juices as you would expect.No newspaper delivered to our room and no Hilton Honors amenities (as an honors gold member, I typically get a free snack and bottled water on check in waiting in my room). I am used to this from all other Hilton brand hotel stays - but not a deal killer by any means.There is a small casino at this hotel with slot machines and a fwe table games.Check out is at noon and this was a very very busy time for the lobby. If you can check out earlier, you will miss the busy period. Check out seemed to maximize around 11am to 1130am.One phone and one remote control in our room was broken. We reported these to front desk but no fix ever came.Overall it was a cozy night, but a bit loud and searching for food options was not fun (pizza delivery ended at midnight). The rooms were fine as was the buffet (althought busy). I'd probably stay here again if just staying one night because of value and proximity to airport - but if you are looking for a long stay in San Juan, I would opt for something closer to the beach or closer to old town. We were advised not to walk the 6 blocks at night to the Chilis restaurant by hotel employees.The description of the beach being 1.5 blocks - hmmm, those are some long blocks.If you want optimum proximity to the cruise terminal, there is a Sheraton in old town right across the street from the terminal. The Embassy Suites is about a 30 min cab ride to the cruise terminal - and costs around $30. Cab from airpor to the hotel was $25 but we suspect we overpaid even though the cab fairs are predetermined by some cab authority at the airport. I bet we had some surpluss added just because we were picked up at the aiport. This fare was based on # of people. The fare to the cruise terminal seemed to be based on distance traveled. Whatever. I was confused. I didnt particularly like Puerto Rico anyway.I'll leave a review on the Carnival Victory elsewhere. If I fail to mention it there, the cruise terminal is horrible and mismanaged. The aiport in SJ is also very undersized and not very well run.

<Content>A Nice Place for Families or Business We stayed at the Hampton Inn pre-cruise so decided to try the Embassy Suites post-cruise. This Embassy Suites is located very near Isla Verde Avenue which has many places to eat, drink and gamble. The hotel also is very near the airport (5-10 minutes max). Cab from the hotel to the airport (4 people, 5 bags) was $18.00. Cab from the Royal Caribbean pier to the Embassy for the same person/bag configuration was around $25. The hotel had flawless checkin and allowed us in earlier than the posted 4 PM checkin. The courtyard area was great. The casino is smaller but had lots of people playing. Live music was in the casino later at night. The pool was very pretty and had a nice hottub area as well but we did not have time to use it.We used laundry onsite which was adequate. The health club is fairly small for a business hotel but had a couple of each of the most popular machines.The rooms have an older decor but were clean and well maintained. It seems that the bathroom in ours was newer except for the floor tile. Again, still very nice and clean.The beds are not yet converted to the Embassy Suites style in the states as they still have bedspreads. I much prefer beds with duvet covers that get washed every stay vs bedspreads.The free business center was great as well as the wireless internet available throughout the hotel. It was nice to get back in touch with people after being on the cruise.Noting that San Juan is a very expensive place, the manager's reception with snacks and drinks held even on the Sunday night we were there was a nice freebie. The cooked to order omelets and other hot breakfast items were all very good and add to the value of this hotel. The breakfast / reception area is large at this Embassy allowing ample seating for many guests. Given the choice for our next stay, we'd choose this over the Hampton Inn even though it is slightly more expensive.

<Content>Quite acceptable, not exceptional I found this Embassy Suites hotel to be adequate and sufficient enough to merit a neutral / average rating. I'm actually having difficulty writing this review because nothing really stood out as exceptional nor negative. I looked down on the pool and thought it looked like a really nice place to spend the weekend. Unfortunately, I was in San Juan for work.

<Content>OK for an airport hotel The Sunday breakfast was not cooked to order and the eggs,waffles and potatoes were cold. The carpet base molding in my room was falling off, there was mold at the floor on the bathroom tile. The staff were fine, very helpful.

<Content>We loved Embassy Suites for the amazing value and great staff. The last review really went into great detail about the hotel and what ES has to offer :) I won't have to write the huge review I thought I would have to :)We had amazing service from the entire staff right from the moment we checked in at 11AM and Ilene the desk manager had our suite ready for us :) We did eat twice at Outback steakhouse and the first night ordered the happy hour two for one margaritas and was told it was already 7PM on their computer...we looked at my watch (6:49) and the waiter's watch(6:48!) and asked him to go and change the time of their computer. He came back and sweated abit, (turns out his manager was trying to make us pay full price) and then went and honoured the happy hour prices. It was now 6:55, he apologized a few times and seemed relieved that we were not upset...I wondered if this happened often?? We enjoyed our two meals there the first night the steaks and ribs were very good. Second time we arrived at 6 after a tiring day at the rainforest and the hamburgers and chicken burgers (and the happy hour margs LOL) were incredible :) The walk down to the Isla Verde BLVD is a quick maybe 3-5 min walk, I had thought (mistakenly) that we would have to walk two city blocks and cross a extremely busy almost freeway to get to the beach but this was not the case at all. We walked down the little side street to the crosswalk by the burger king strip mall and there was the most lovely beach WOW :)Speaking of the Burger King/Ponderosa strip mall there is a lovely Puerto Rician restaurant in there named Mi Casta)wrng name sorry but you will see it) We ate there once and it was great and very cheap and always busy :)We were delighted with the largness of our king bed one bedroom suite. Housekeeping always left the room spotless and changed our sheets the third day in. Buffet servers were always there to clear away plates and the servers at the Manager's reception were a delight. We made sure to tip housekeepers, breakfast staff and bartenders at the reception and our drinks were there within seconds of us standing in line. I truly can not say enough good things about this hotel and it's great value and staff!!Yea the furniture is a little dated but who cares?? We were not paying Westin, Intercontinental or Ritz -Carlton prices for this hotel. We paid $143.00 plus taxes and the resort fee , we had a car but did not do the valet parking and they actually waived our parking I think because I am a HH member. Nice touch.I travel alot for work and stay at some very nice hotels and resorts and must say this ES, along with all of her staff, really is at the top of the pack because of the great stay we just had there :)

<Content>Good, Not Great My husband and I stayed at this Embassy Oct. 22-28. We received a AAA rate of $152.99 plus tax, plus the hotels resort tax of 12% made the room around $180. Also, self parking in the parking garage was $14 a day. The hotel is located within a mile of the airport, but we were never bothered by plane noise. He was there on business, and I was there for pleasure. The resort tax allows you to make free local calls and use the wifi from your suite. Note: the wifi was sometimes weak on the 7th floor and not powerful enough to use in the bedroom part of the suite. Our room was clean, but the carpet needs to be replaced, and the furniture in the bedroom was nicked. A paint job was also needed in our suite. The king bed in our suite was comfortable, except for stiff pillows. The rate includes breakfast which includes made to order omelets or eggs (tip is not accepted like Embassy's in America); bad pancakes; so-so french toast; fruit; cereal; toast/bagels; juices; coffee; yogurts. Also included is the Manager's Reception Happy Hour from 5:30-7:30 nightly. You can get two drinks (or a double) per person at a time, but there is no limit to how many times you go back. There's one beer on tap, wines, and mid level alcohol. We tipped a dollar at each trip. Some people don't tip at all. Popcorn, a mix of chips, and pop were available as well. Service from the staff was not consistent. Some of the younger employees were not as helpful as the more mature ones. The pool is clean, huge and lovely. There's a pool bar, but it was never open. After numerous people asked for drink and food service, a staffer came out and took orders. Drinks were delivered promptly, but the food took over an hour. Except for a few smoking suites, this is a non-smoking hotel, as most establishments in Puerto Rico.. even the casinos. But, you can smoke outside at the pool, or out front of the hotel. There are ash trays and benches set up in the front, but no ashtrays by the pool. Most people just put their cigarettes out on the ground. Towels are available for free at the pool, and you can also take them to the beach which is a good 2 blocks away. We didn't make it to the beach but heard it was very nice. There's a self laundry room on the main level which requires $1.75 to wash and $1.50 for a 30 minute dry. The front desk will exchange bills for quarters and sell you a small ziploc bag full of powder detergent for $2.14.Note: There is a gift shop, but it's under renovation at this point.We ordered room service 4 times and the food was pretty good. Sometimes not as hot as we'd like, but we'd use the microwave in our suite to warm the food. If you like burgers, order them well-done, or they'll come out pretty rare. I recommend the french onion soup. Pizza Hut and Domino's delivers to the hotel, but you have to go to the lobby to retrieve it. We didn't order from Pizza Hut, but Domino's pizza was good and reasonable. Inside the hotel is an Outback Steakhouse. It's as good as any I've been to, but more expensive. It's open for dinner only Sunday - Friday, and opens for lunch on Saturdays. We ate lunch at Lupi's (near by) which was expensive and just so-so. Be careful ordering pop, no free refills. There are two ATMS in the hotel. There was no fee involved except for what your bank charges. You can also cash a check up to $100 a day at the front desk. Be prepared for your check being denied by the security check company they use. One of our checks was approved, the other denied. The casino is on the small side. Lots of slots including penny slots. Two blackjack tables, a 3 card poker table, and 2 roulette tables in which one was always very busy, and rarely did they open the 2nd even if there were people standing around wanting to play. I think the casino opens at 11 am and closes at 4 am. There was entertainment in the bar/casino area Fri-Sun nights. Good, but most songs were popular hits only in PR. Taxi's are always available but pricey, and you can pay for valet parking for $20 day. There's a free business office to use the internet (2 computers) and free use of the printer. There's a grocery store and other shops a block away. Ponderosa is also close by. There's also plenty of hotels in the area within walking distance that have casinos. The Intercontinental has beautiful grounds, a good casino and a Japanese steakhouse that we heard was very good. All in all, I'd give this hotel 3 stars. Feel free to contact me with any questions.

<Content>Great Stay; Near the Airport I was in San Juan on business. The room was clean and comfortable. The toilet backed up on my second day there, but I reported it on my way out in the morning, and it was repaired before I returned in the evening. Parking is expensive ($14/day), but it's a covered parking deck, which is nice considering the heat. There's a very good complimentary hot breakfast every morning, including an omellete bar, as well as a manager's reception every night where guests get two complementary drinks. The drive to the airport is less than five minutes, but I didn't hear any overhead air traffic while I was inside the hotel.This was my second stay at the Embassy Suites San Juan, and it will be my first choice the next time I find myself in Puerto Rico.

<Content>great hotel- best part of PR and saved the trip The Embassy suites hotel saved our vacation. The hotel was beautiful and the pool was warm and comfortable as well as huge.We were on the 5th floor and it was quiet and comfortable. Service good, food good and breakfast was the best.The beach is only two blocks (about 3 mins) walk away from the hotel.We stayed and dined at the hotel because the local restaurants were so unfriendly towards tourists especially towards african americans and dominicans. we refused to support this and stayed away. We couldn't believe how rude local island puerto ricans were when they are so nice here at in NY.If it were'nt for the nice, friendly staff at the hotel, we would have ended the trip early and flew to DR or Jamaica.

<Content>Perfect in every way! We came to Puerto Rico for a friend's wedding. The bride had chosen this hotel for all the guests from the states to stay in. Very smart bride! This hotel was convenient to the airport and lovely Isla Verde beach. Lots of restaurants  a grocery store nearby. The hotel itself has a nice parking garage for your rental car. The desk staff, bar tenders  gift shop girls speak english.The free breakfast is outstanding! The pool is way above average! We never encountered any problems of any kind and would recommend this hotel to any body, especially first-time Puerto Rico visitors.

<Content>Nice hotel but has many downfalls Two most important things in a hotel is location and cleanliness. This hotel was clean and the room was nice. Location was not so great. I would not recommend staying in Isle Verde. Unless you are into gambling, there is very little to do in the area. Isle Verde beach was okay but if you want a tropical experience, go to islands from Farjado. The pool is beautiful and large but the beach is a 20 minute walk.This hotel was extremely unorganized. If you want to take advantage of happy hour and free breakfast, expect to wait in a long line. If the bar is supposed to open at 11, expect to wait until noon. Even ordering a simple sandwich, took over an hour.It was also quite loud in the room due to the casino (open until 4am) but might not be a problem if you are on a higher floor. The worst part was the uncomfortable bed which was hard as a rock.

<Author>everfair
<Content>Spotty service (Disclaimer: I previously wrote a pretty scathing review just after our honeymoon, but thought that wasn鈥檛 fair as I was still in the heat of emotion, so I have let time mellow me out鈥?We booked this hotel for our honeymoon. My husband and I are not really the pampered sort鈥e usually are able to go along and have a great time, despite slightly negative reviews (i.e. budget hotels in Italy). However, possibly the negative reviews regarding this hotel should be heeded. Thinking that this is a Hilton-owned, we figured we couldn鈥檛 be too bad off. We even booked our stay and the accompanying flight off of Hilton.com鈥檚 vacation package leg. But once we got to the hotel, they seemed to have cancelled our reservation because they rudely told me that we were a 鈥渘o-show鈥?(we had a late flight and it ended up being slightly delayed). First off, it showed that we already prepaid for our stay so it shouldn鈥檛 have mattered when we showed up. Anyhow, we were dead tired and we just needed to crash first, so we needed the room. Since they had cancelled us before finally getting a manager to reinstate us, all they had available were smoking rooms. Fatigue set in and we couldn鈥檛 argue, so we took it, but we told them that we needed to switch rooms after others checked out. They said it wasn鈥檛 a problem, which they kept to their word, and later that afternoon before we left, we stopped by the front desk to change keys and they moved our luggage into the new room for us. When we came back, they left a fruit plate and a bottle of red wine along with a note apologizing for our inconvenience, which was nice. The lay out of the suite in general was nice, with a living area with a pull out sleeper couch, dining table, mini fridge and microwave, bar sink. The bedroom was a good size for walking around in without bumping into furniture. Bathrooms were standard. I liked the curved shower curtain rod that prevented the shower curtain from sticking to me as I showered. Amenities we used at the hotel:Breakfast: the signature Embassy Suites cooked to order breakfast was fantastic鈥melets, pancakes, French toast. Most of the time though, there were so many people, so a few of the days we just opted to eat the items from the self-service bar (scrambled eggs, sausage, corned beef hash) and fruit (pineapple, melon, cantaloupe, bananas, apples). They also had sweet corn grits (wonderful) or oatmeal (not so great), as well as single serve yogurts. Outback Steakhouse: really good鈥tandard restaurant, but convenient when we had a long day and didn鈥檛 want to go back out for dinner. The churrasco (skirt steak) was really good. Our server was fantastic as well.Manager鈥檚 cocktail hour: one free alcoholic drink per person. The line was really long as well, but my husband pre-tipped the bartender and our drinks came out strong. Also had popcorn, chips, and other snack food.Parking: Self parking that was $12-14Casino: although small, it provided us with a few late nights鈥?worth of entertainment. They have a few tables each of poker, blackjack, and roulette. They have penny, nickel, and quarter slots. My husband and I found a video slot machine that we enjoyed when we were in Vegas so we were excited about that. The servers brought alcohol around as long as you tip (make sure you tip each time a dollar or so or they seem to disappear). They also have soup and grilled ham and cheese sandwiches in the late evenings so be sure to ask for those (and tip!)Pool: we sat by the pool but never went in. We weren鈥檛 impressed (probably because the beach is only a few blocks away!). Lots of kids and teenagers running around. They had a masseuse cabana available for massages poolside which I鈥檓 disappointed that I didn鈥檛 get a chance to try. Casino bar: the afternoon that we hung out by the pool, we decided to order food, but were told we had to re-enter the hotel to order at the casino bar as take out to bring out. The woman who took our order at the bar was very rude, basically ignoring us when we first got there. She could鈥檝e written down our order but instead, she forgot it and had to yell for us to repeat it once she got to the register. Then after waiting twenty minutes for two sandwiches, we found out she put the order in wrong. When she finally got our sandwiches, she placed it on the counter and didn鈥檛 tell us that it was ours. Ugh. By the time we ate our sandwiches which were grilled, they were lukewarm. We were extremely disappointed. She really ruined our afternoon. We ended up calling the general manager (the number on the comment card in the room) and got through and voiced our disappointment. I didn鈥檛 want to do it all trip, but I finally pulled the honeymoon card and told him that I had thought that after having my wedding at a fabulous Hilton and enjoying fantastic service, I should be able to expect having Hilton hospitality on my honeymoon as well. The general manager was very apologetic and stated to us that he will consider possibly retraining some of his staff. He asked if there was anything he could comp us on, but we told him that we just sincerely wanted to voice our opinion. (On the last night he sent us a bottle of champagne anyways, but said that it was a honeymoon gift.) I鈥檇 like to add though, that it the general manager did make us feel like he cared about how our stay was going, which meant a lot to us. So our general conclusion with this Embassy Suites? I suppose that for a couple nights鈥?stay (like a quick long weekend) it would be ok, but probably not for a special occasion. Now that we are recalling our memories, it鈥檚 not as painful, but during what should鈥檝e been a great time, it was a bit of an inconvenience. I鈥檇 like to add that as a general comment with regard to San Juan鈥檚 tourist areas, for some reason, the hospitality isn鈥檛 really up to par with other destinations. (which disappointed my Puerto Rican husband immensely) Unfortunately, at a few of the places that we went to, we got treated worse than our neighborhood Applebee鈥檚.

<Content>great hotel Our family of 5 just returned and while we were disappointed in Puerto Rico overall due to safety concerns and unfriendly locals, Embassy Suites made our stay very pleasant and positive. We appreciated the great housekeeping and clean suite/hotel, the friendly and helpful employees, and the breakfast was excellent with so many choices, as well as the complimentary evening drinks. The kids even enjoyed that family time playing cards and snacking after a day of exploring the island or going to the beaches. The location is close to airport and local stores,but the walk to the beach is really 2 blocks. We felt it was a good value though and would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Nice Place for the Family We just returned from a four-night stay at the Embassy Suites - San Juan.The good: friendly and helpful staff, free cook-to-order breakfast, a nightly manager's reception featuring free cocktails, nice pool area and a small but fun casino.Located within the hotel is the Outback Restaurant. If travelling with teen-agers, the Outback provided a good, familiar option for dining.The not-so-good: furniture in room was dated. Because I was travelling with my three teen-agers, we needed to use the sofa bed for sleeping. NOT GOOD. Very old and uncomfortable...for sitting and sleeping.The actual beds in the one-bedroom suite, were comfy.We did have one issue with an exposed wire in the bathroom due to a broken switch-plate. My son received a shock. I called guest services to ask for a replacement. I was told someone was on their way, but never came. I stopped asking.Other than that, it is a pleasant hotel. Location is OK. A short walk to the ocean (about two blocks) and to Isla Verde Ave.

<Content>Generally nice hotel The Good: the Embassy Suites Isla Verde is just like a thousand other Embassy Suites hotels. That is to say, with a nice center atrium, good breakfast, etc. It also has a small casino (if you're interested in that sort of thing, which I am not). The pool area is rather large, with a nice waterfall for the kids to play in. People complain about airplane noise because the hotel is right next to the airport, but honestly the only time I ever heard planes was sitting at the pool. Inside the hotel, you'd never know they were there.It is also an easy walk to the beach, where you can rent 2 chairs and an umbrella for $18. The attendants were reasonably courteous (it helps to speak Spanish though) and asked when we left if we were coming back. Another good feature about the location is that it is easily accessible to both Old San Juan and the eastern beach areas such as Fajardo. You must do the Fajardo bio bay tour - see my review of Laguna Grande - and it's about 1:15 drive. If you stayed in Old San Juan, it would be considerably longer, especially with traffic. The Carolina/Isla Verde area is nicely situated in the middle.One of the closest restaurants, which I cannot recommend highly enough, is the tiny Mi Casita that's right on the way to the beach. They have wonderful food, and excellent prices. It's very small but pleasant. The waiters speak English but with the busboys etc. it helps to be able to speak to them in Spanish. Order the mofongo: my wife had chicken and I had fried pork. The fried pork was rather dry, but between the sauce that comes with the mofongo and a good local Medalla beer, it is fine. The Metropol is another nearby restaurant with good local food, although we did not go there.The Bad: Not really bad, but the hotel does not really have much in the way of local feel. You could be at any other Embassy Suites hotel, and it would be just about the same. I think some of the smaller hotels in the area have much more of a Caribbean feel to them. We were only there for two days pre-cruise, but if you are there longer you may want more of a local experience at another hotel. Also, although the rooms were nice, for the high price I expected them to be a bit cleaner than they were. This seems to be an endemic problem with hotels in the area, however: and my guess is that the Embassy Suites is about as clean as you're going to get. My wife is a clean freak and she was happy with it.Bottom line, a nice hotel, good location.

<Content>Could have been better..... We went to Puerto Rico for a Family Vacation/Honeymoon. Let me start by saying the hotel was nice and the pool was huge. One morning the pool opened 4 hours late because they had to clean it. Once we got to get in lots of floating plants and sand on the steps I don't know what they cleaned. A couple days in to the stay there was a Prom. No big deal ....so I thought. Most proms the kids stay the night then go home....oh not here they stayed for 3 days and ran the hotel the entire time. They didn't care who else was there they did what they wanted and the hotel could care less. At one point they wouldn't even let us off the elevator. The staff was nice but useless. They let the kids bud in line during happy hour and breakfast.....and not just 1-2 people would try and cut in line 5-6 would come running up. We had to say no and stop them ourself even though the staff was standing right next to them. The stay would have been much better without all the teenagers.BTW, beware of the amount they hold on your cc'd when you check in. The held $1600.00 on our card for incidentals.....now come on!!! What the do they think 2 adults and 2 kids we're going to do for $1600.00!?!? We were on a budget and needed that money for other things.

<Content>San Juan BOMBS!! I was worried when reading the reviews which is usually the case when I read reviews at Trip Advisory. People write to complain about this or that, because they were not happy. I just spent a week here with a group of friends, we had three rooms, and we all had a good time. The breakfast bar was fine, and the happy hour (find the cute bartender and ask for San Juan Bombs!). The casino was small, but the tables always had seats, with 5 dollar limits. Drink service was strange ask the pit boss for drink tickets, and you will have no problem. The room was fine, the bed was comfortable, the pool was nice (couple service problems during the stay but nothing to ruin the trip), the beach was close, and the staff was friendly. I would stay here again without a second thought.

<Content>Loved the first 3 days, the last 3 were a nightmare! We booked 2 rooms as our daughter and her family were traveling with us on June 24th after our daughter's wedding. The first three days were great, not crowded, the staff is pleasant and we liked our location. On Thursday over 100 kids from Puerto Rico descinded on the hotel for the beginning of a three day stay to celebrate their Senior Prom. The kids who were between 16-18 had the rule of the place. At the happy hour they would place one kid in line with a valid ID and then he would motion for 10 of his friends to join him when he got to the front. When other people objected, the poor girl who was at the line checking ID's tried to do something, but she seemed uncomfortable confronting the kids. They would press all the buttons in the elevator regardless of the floor and you then stopped on every floor. For two nights in a row, the room next to ours played loud music, partied and argued until past 4 am. We had young kids with us and didn't get much sleep. I called and went down to the front desk a couple of times, but not much changed. When I said something at checkout and the manager on duty said these kids have been hard on us too. For the inconvience, they waived our parking fee. We love the Embassy Suites, and I'm sure this doesn't occur on a regular basis, but security didn't seem to do anything to address the problem, the manager seemed more concened about how this was affecting the staff rather than the guests and the last few days of our family vacation left us sleepless and with a bad impression. My advice for travelers going to Embassy Suites is to ask if they are having a prom. The manager did say that this was a tough group of kids and not like the norm.

<Content>Will never forget this place, the best! This place was just the best! I won't forget the breakfast they had, they had Spanish oatmeal, Spanish corn meal, Spanish maizena and all sorts of other delicious stuff in their buffet. They even had a chef cook up omelets any style you wanted them in.Parking was not an issue at all. The pool was perfect, with a private jacuzzi as well. The pool has a beautiful waterfall that you just want to sit under all day.There's also the funniest and funnest bingo event every night. You have to try it once.Free drinks between 5-7pm every night as well. All you can drink, we would take our drinks to the jacuzzi and just come back for more and more.The rooms were great, two tv's, comfy, comfy bed, cleaning people were great. Even folded some clothes I left hanging around.I actually recently stayed at the Gran Melia in Rio Grande, big mistake, you dont get a quarter of the stuff you get at Embassy, and the Embassy is a quarter of the price. Will stay at Embassy from here on end.The hotel was also near so much night life, walking distance to starbucks, a must have for me. Walgreens is nearby if you need anything urgently at night since its open 24hrs. Again, a 4 minute walk.It gets 6 stars from me.

<Content>everything ship shape After reading so many horror stories on other San Juan hotels, I booked the Embassy Suites for the first few nights with the plan to check out some other (cheaper, closer to town) places after I landed. This Embassy Suites is right near the airport. I did not hear airplane noise. Everything here worked perfectly and was clean and ready for me. The hotel is beautiful and well maintained. There was horrific noise in the 8-story atrium most nights, either from the local band at the bar or the large banquet parties booked every night. BUT...the living room of the suite acted as a buffer, and when I went into the bedroom with the door shut, I couldn't hear a thing. The internet access was free, but when I logged on the first time it said I would be charged $10 per day. (I was not charged, just confused.)This neighborhood is listed as Carolina, but the locals call it Isla Verde after the great beach that is 2 blocks away. There is a bus (A5) that runs all the way down the coast into Old San Juan for 75 cents, but the service is slow and erratic. It goes through 2 housing projects, which might scare some people, but I felt safe. If you are not going to take the bus, taxis are expensive. Most people say you should rent a car in San Juan, but the drivers don't follow right-of-way rules, and I'm glad I did not. Parking in all of San Juan and Isla Verde is a nightmare, and the valet at the hotel was $20. If you just want to relax and go to the beach/pool every day, this place would be great. The management pays attention to details here, so you can relax. It's far from cultural attractions and real local neighborhoods.

<Content>Great hotel, Great location. Perfect My wife and I stayed here for part of our honeymoon. The rooms are large, clean and perfect for relaxing. The cooked to order breakfast was always good and the free 2 hour happy hour was very nice as well. The hotel is clean and in a great location. Less then a 3 min walk to a perfect beach. The hotel pool is fantastic and the staff go out of their way to help you out. You are also close to Old town San Juan, about 10 min by taxi. Also close by there is a Ritz, El San Juan hotel and and intercontinental. All three are great if you want to get dressed up and go for a great meal, diner and dancing, all with great casinos. This hotel is great value for money. I would not stay anywhere else.

<Content>Great San Juan Hotel Me and wife stayed here 5 days 4 nights June 5th - June 9th. The hotel is a short 2 block walk to the beach, and close to lots of restaraunts and nightlife. The free breakfast in the morning is great - the happy hr is ok (drinks are really weak - which is what what you would expect when it's free). Only other complaint I had was the casino, as other guest have said, it was small - and the beverage service was slow...but overall, this place is a good place to stay.

<Content>They thought of everything My two friends and I(50 something) chose this hotel for a girlfriend getaway and it was perfect for our needs.We arrived on Friday night and getting a taxi from the airport was very easy and quick.My one and only complaint is the room we reserved and reconfirmed the day before was not available. We reserved a room with two doubles, but they said the only thing available for that night was one king. They had a big party in the lobby and the only way they could accomodate them was to give them our room for the night. One of my friends planned on sleeping on the sofa anyway, so we agreed .They did comp the extra person fee as our original reservation was for two and later turned out to be three. We thought that was fair.The next day around 2 they moved all our stuff, we didn't have to wait around, and just stopped at the desk to exchange keys.The staff were all friendly and at least twice a day someone would ask if everything was ok with our room.One day we forgot the do not disturb sign on the door all day and there was a message under the door saying what time the maid was there and if we needed anything like clean towels, don't hesitate to call. I really like the layout of these suites. There's quite a space between bedroom and living room and a tv in both rooms, so especially travelling with friends who might be on different clocks, you don't have to tip toe around for fear of waking someone up. There's a frig,microwave,coffeemaker,coffee ,tea and I brought some paper plates and plastic cutlery that really came in handy with leftovers.There's a large grocery store around the corner, so we kept the ice bucket full and had a lot of drinks and snacks in our own little place. A standard room wouldn't have been nearly so comfortable.The beds were very comfortable and the powerful shower was heaven, expecially after a day of walking around in that heat. I read a review saying the pool was cold,well,not anymore. We thought it was perfect. By July, it'll probably be too warm. This Puerto Rican sun is hot,hot,hot! There always is a breeze tho, so it doesn't seem as hot as other places I've been in May.We thought the breakfast in the morning was a huge savings and very good. The first day I skipped the omelettes and just had scrambled eggs, but don't do that. You pick all your own ingredients and put it in a bowl, then wait about 2 minutes and yumm. There's also bacon, sausage, potatoes, fruit, pastries and more I've forgotten. Really a nice way to start the day.The manager's reception at night was nice, but not worth a trip back to the hotel if you're doing something else. They serve only Medalla beer, their mixed drinks are quite weak, and surprisingly enough I liked the wine the best. The chardonnay was actually quite good.Another convenience here was free internet in the lobby(3screens). There were quite a few businessmen when we were there, so I only had a little wait a couple times. I imagine when there's more kids in the summer, that might be a different story. I think there's also free service in rooms, but I didn't check into that.The biggest complaint I've read about this hotel is that it's not on the beach. I guess if you want to spend all day on the beach, that would be a consideration. We only spent an hour or two each day so the block and a half walk was no inconvenience to us.After a long tiring day that pool was so nice and never a problem finding a chair at anytime.Again, that might change in the summer. The area around the hotel has lots of restaurants from American chains to cheap authentic to posh and upscale and you can walk to all of them,Im not a fan of chain restaurants, but the Outback in the hotel was actually quite good. It's about $20.00 for a cab to OSJ and the rain forest is about 45 minutes away and a definite must see.When you add it all up, this is a great location and a great value. We would definitely return.

<Content>Embassy Suites, Isla Verde The Embassy Suites is a very comfortable hotel. The breakfast is great in the morning. The staff was friendly. The hotel was beautiful and clean. The pool was freezing. It was hard to even put a toe in. This hotel is within walking distance to the beach, casinos, restaurants (coco bongo is cheap and good) and wal greens.

<Content>Great Hotel! For A Great Price! April10-14 The Embassy Suites in San Juan was by far the BEST decision we made on this trip. You get more then what you pay for, the price was great since it included a delicious Cook to order breakfast every morning  a Happy Hour everyday from 5:30-7:30 all you can drink plus free snacks. The bartenders were great!  Friendly. Those are just a few things that saved us a whole lot $$. The rooms were Spacious  clean! a nice wet bar, a separate living area and great staff! The pool was just beautiful! And relaxing. The casino was a bit small but comfortable and every night they raffle gifts  prizes. I won a $50 raffling prize! This hotel was only a block 1/2 from the beach and just steps away to all restaurants, Hotels  Night Life. The front desk was very helpful with directions etc. The gym room came in handy, and so did the laundry room. There was an Outback Steakhouse in the Hotel the food was great and the prices were reasonable. A small convenience store was great for snacks, cigarettes,  last minute things. The Lobby was just beautifully decorated with Palm trees and ponds, it was just so! Worth it.. We stayed for 4 days but wished we were there longer! Now where are you going to find a great deal like this??? At the Embassy Suites!!There was a small restaurant Mi Casita just in the plaza 1blk away with Great! Spanish food for a great price. Also there was an Edith's Cafe right across from the Hampton Inn Suites on Isla Verde Ave with Delicious food and reasonable prices. Lupis, was a nice place to hear music  have a couple drinks good food as well. I would recommend this hotel to all my friends  family!

<Content>Nice Stay. Hotel overall is nice. The furnishings in the room need replaced. When you sat on the sofa you were practically sitting on the floor. The rooms were much smaller than other embassy suites I have stayed in. Pool area was very nice. Food was good. Bell staff was more helpful than anyone. Really the only problem I had was at the breakfast area when I was asking the girl where stuff was she was rude and walked off. Everyone else was nice,

<Content>Loved it! We just returned from 7 nights at the Embassy in Puerto Rico. What a great time we had! Breakfast provided each day along with an incredible happy hour reception - in which we were very well taken care of by the bartenders! It was a nice way to not spend a lot of money before going out by starting there first. The staff is nice, rooms are immaculate and comfortable. The pool was great and relaxing in the morning but upbeat in the afternoon. The beach and nightlife is just a few blocks away. Bravo to Lupis and Drums - two of our favorite places. The driving down there appeared to be a bit frightening when crossing the street - I don't think I would rent a car. Cab ride to Old San Juan is 19 bucks and worth it. It is beautiful. Check out the little Doug's pub on the corner and the other Lupis. People were very nice and friendly and we definitely will be returning.

<Content>Great Value Just came back from Puerto Rico and thought I would share our experience. If you are looking for a good value, the Embassy Suites is it. This hotel is moderately sized and moderately priced and was a great value.It is located near the airport which was convenient, there was a little noise from the airport but minimal. I had a hard time deciding on this hotel vs. others that were on the beach, I'm glad I picked the Embassy Suites. The beach is about two blocks away, the ES lets you use their towels. You can also rent chiars to lay on (about $4 bucks a piece) You are on the beach with local folks and those who paid to stay on the beach, so overall, for us, we felt we got the better deal.There was free breakfast every morning (omelets, pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.) and the manager's reception for drinks every night from 5:30-7:30. You get about 3 drinks during that time and snacks if you so choose. I expected the manager's reception to be a mad house, but it was very organized. If you go, go after 6. Folks begin to line up at 5:30, if you wait a little while you will have lttle to no wait.Customer service was excellent. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Often times we were thanked for staying there. We ordered towels and they came within 10 minutes. Ten minutes later we received a call ensuring that we received the towels. It was great.We booked this hotel for $199 p/n. I'm glad that we did, by the time the additional fees are charged (it is cited on ES website) we paid $239 p/n. When researching hotels, I noticed that all of them charge these extra fees, so be sure to consider those additional fees when booking.I visited Old San Juan one day, it would have been $40 r/t in a cab, but instead I walked across the way to the Holiday Inn. They had a Dollar Rent A Car. Without taxes and insurance it was about $25 p/d, however I did have to pay for Parking in Old San Juan, so if you do rent a car, make it worth your time to have one.Overall Puerto Rico was great, it's well traveled in Isla Verde, but the city is beautiful.

<Content>Best of a bad situation My husband and I stayed here for two nights under not the best circumstances. We had to leave our cruise ship before it sailed due to a personal emergency. However, we had a pleasant stay until we could get a flight home. The included breakfast and cocktail social included in the price of the room was a definite plus. The atrium surroundings were lovely. Our suite had a separate bedroom and living room with tv's in both. The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows and linens. The rooms were very clean and included refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker. An Outback Steakhouse was conveniently located in the atrium lobby which was open for dinner until late in the evening for late arrivals. The pool area was very nice and it was an easy two block walk to the beach. The hotel has its own small casino which was closed due to renovation while we were there. There is a business center in the lobby with computers available, free internet access and free printing. This hotel is very close to the airport, but we were not bothered by the sound of planes overhead. It would be a pleasant place to stay for a night before or after a cruise.

<Content>Pleasant Surprise We stayed at the Embassy Suites February 21st-February 25th 2008. Travelers consisted of three couples ranging from ages 28-38. I read many reviews as I do every time I travel, some good some not so good. I must say that we were pleasantly surprised. I realize that it may bother some people that it is so close to the airport, but it really did not affect us. We never lost any sleep over that or the music in the atrium. The 2 room suite was decent and very spacious. The buffet breakfast ( which is included) was also very good. We especially liked the fact that they make cooked to order eggs/omelettes. The 2 hour nightly manager's free happy hour was also a nice bonus considering the fact that you are staying at a hotel so they overprice the cocktails. It is a good idea to go to the supermarket and pick up your own beverages. You will save considerably. I am used to all-inclusive so it was tough for me to see that they were charging $5.00 for a beer. I am by no means cheap, just pratical. Also, I read reviews that stated the beach was about a ten minute walk??? The walk is about 5 minutes, possibly under. We went to the beach several times after laying by the pool which was extremely cold. The pool was our only disappointment. It was nice to look at and that's about it. I spent most of my time in the hot tub. There are many places to eat outside the hotel. If you like to walk you will find pleanty on the way. Fortunately, I traveled with people who know the island so we were able to hop in the car and go to different locations which is a huge plus. Also, the casino which is open until 4 A.M. is pretty small, but we did not have a problem with that. I believe we make our own vacations what they are ie. fun, romantic,quiet etc. It is a great hotel for the value. We would certainly stay there again in the future. As a matter of fact, we just booked a trip for April at another Embassy Suites in a different part of PR.

<Content>Convenient pre-cruise stay We stayed here three nights precruise. Great location 鈥?close to the airport and close enough to the port. I always try to stay at Embassy Suites for short stays as I think they are pretty consistent in quality and I like the two room idea for quietness and space. In this particular case, since my husband is a smoker, I gave in and stayed in a smoking room. Be warned that the smoking rooms have no ventilation, no fan, no way of opening a window so they are pretty gross. My husband even said it was pretty bad. I really liked having an Outback as the onsite restaurant. The food was prepared just as in the States complete with steamed veggies 鈥?something hard to find in the islands. Just a block and a half away is the main street with Burger King, Walgreens, and other fast food type restaurants. A block and a half away is the beach. We weren鈥檛 there for the beach and just walked over to check it out. To me, it certainly wasn鈥檛 the beautiful Caribbean beach you might expect. The block between the main street and the beach was just full of trash 鈥?disgusting actually.The free breakfast was just passable. The omelets were edible 鈥?that鈥檚 about all I can say about them. We didn鈥檛 partake in the free happy hour but each day saw pretty long lines of people waiting for their free drinks. We didn鈥檛 use the pool but it looked nice but small.I would stay here again for a short stay but would never select this place as a land based vacation resort. By the way, we hired a private driver for two days through Countryside Tours. This was worth every penny. We got to see so much of the real Puerto Rico plus the tourist sites of Arecibo, Ponce, and El Yunque. The Fajardo area has beautiful beaches and resorts and I would look into that area if I were to return to Puerto Rico for a land vacation.

<Content>Family friendly Our stay was ok. At check in the staff was not as friendly as we expected. The made to order breakfast was good and also included in price. Our room was clean although there was a great big stain in the carpet under the dinette table (looked like coffee) we found some Skiddles Candies stuck to one of the bed sheets. We complained and Our resort fee was waved. The pool area was noisy the hotel is a few yards away from one of the airport runways. Overall not a bad experience. Don't know about staying here again.

<Content>Great Hotel Near the Airport As many reviewers have written, this is a nice hotel near the airport. The pool is great for kids and the beach is a short walk from the hotel. The small casino was not crowded during the week and the breakfast buffet was above average.Like most Embassy Suites, the rooms were clean and the staff was attentive.Overall, a great place to stay for a day or two before leaving Puerto Rico.On a side note, I've read some reviews about the expensive taxis to Old San Juan and recommending renting a car. This is a fine idea if you are going to tour part of the island, but if you are planning on only going to Old San Juan you can take the bus for $0.75 each way. It takes 45 minutes, but it is a straight shot.

<Content>Nice stay at the Embassy Suites We just came home from a long weekend to Puerto Rico. We picked the Embassy Suites because of the short distance from the airport. The hotel was clean and neat and the extra room in the suite was great! The beach is a 2 minute walk from the hotel which we didn't mind at all. We stayed all day - the water was beautiful. The hotel is also walking distance from nice restaurants so we didn't feel like we needed a car during our short stay.

<Content>Handy, Clean and Nice Big Rooms The hotel is literally right beside the airport landing strip and beside the freeway, yet you can't hear these noises from your room. The casino is located in the atrium and the noise from the live music filtered up to the rooms, but the great thing about the Embassy Suites is that you can close the door to your separate bedroom and you can't hear a thing. I thought it was neat to sit at the very spacious and well conceived pool and literally watch the planes coming down. The pool's waterfall, for the most part filters out the plane noise. There were enough chaise lounges for everyone who came to the pool (and it was full) and you can get a massage and other spa services poolside.The food at the Outback located in the hotel was terrific and the service that we received from the Embassy staff was great, especially the day manager, Bo. Overall, great location with clean rooms, good service, good food , conveniently located by the airport and other good restaurants, blocks away from the beach and for sightseeing into Old San Juan. I understand the taxi fares from this area to be a little high to go to Old San Juan and would recommend renting a car for the $40 a day which would also allow you access to the Rain Forest and the Caves. Parking rates at the Embassy are $14 and $20 for self and valet parking, respectively.

<Content>Great location if you want near the airport. This was our last night in Puerto Rico and our third hotel. We wanted a clean, reliable place next to the airport and it was all three. If fact we ended up having fun too! Happy hour was great, the atrium great and we loved that The Outback was right there. It was ironic, The Outback is a steak place, but I remembered they usually have broccoli and it's usually not overcooked and I was right. What is so big about broccoli? I was craving vegetables!! For some reason it's hard to get any green veggies in Puerto Rico. the Embassy Suites is a great place for the location to the airport. Our room was clean, large, had great amentities and the bathroom was great too. I would stay again.

<Content>Embassy Suites a good stay. We were traveling with an 8 year old, a 10 year old and two 22 year olds so for us the choice of Embassy suites was due to that you could fit 6 people in a suite with two double beds and a pull out couch. Very pricey - paid 209 one night, 259 another night and 309 for the weekend night. Weird but long story. Even at the 200 + per night stay it was worth it to not have to pay for two seperate rooms and everyone ate breakfast free. The free cocktail 2 hours was also enjoyed by all, as they also had sodas, virgin drinks and popcorn for the kids. The kids loved the pool. It was an easy walk to the beach. Rooms were clean. Lobby was clean and well taken care of. Eating in San Juan with little ones is difficult if you are trying to get a bit of the local flavor. We are not fans of eating at fast food joints, there are PLENTY of these if that is your thing. We did find a good place that served local dishes withing walking distance. Mi Casita. The kids all found something they liked. Don't go to any restraunt in Puerto Rico hungry as the food takes a while and in the case of Mi Casita - take a sweater. Old San Juan is a short drive from the Embassy Suites but you can rent a car from car rentals near by or take a taxi. Expensive Vallet service, plus extra 14 dollars a day to park. We also went to El Yunque on our own instead of a tour. Very easy to do. Great snack bar in the main information area - kid friendly food. The hotel is VERY close to the airport. A 15 dollar taxi ride for 6 people and 8 pieces of luggage. The front desk was very helpful in getting toothbrushes ect to the room. Had our lost luggage waiting for us when we woke up in the morning. Very nice people. Pricey for us but worth it.

<Content>Typical Embassy Suites, but with bad staff We stayed here one night pre-cruise. Picked this hotel based on it's proximity to the airport (late arriving flight). We walked into the lobby at 10pm on a Friday night to be greeted by echoing, loud drums (I think it was supposed to be a band) from some kind of 'event' that had been going on. As we were checking in, I asked the non-interested clerk behind the desk how long the music would be going on, she shrugged and said 'they were almost done'...which translated to another few hours (i guess i should've asked for a clarification of island time). I explained that our luggage had been lost by American Airlines and they said we should inform the hotel so they would be on-hand to receive it, and instead of any sympathy or offer of toiletries, she again shrugged and said 'someone's always here'. We went to the bar in the lobby for a drink, and received the first one from a helpful waitress, but my husband had to go to the bar to get his second drink because the other waitress was too busy standing 2 feet from us talking to another person at the bar. I gave up on getting a second one after she walked by our table and ignored us and my empty glass the 3rd time (and I'm a VERY patient person). Casino was incredibly small and looked like part of it was under renovation. Suite and breakfast were usual for Embassy Suites...lots of room in the room and hit-or-miss food at the buffett (it was really busy and they had trouble replenishing the food to keep up). My husband bought toiletries in the hotel gift shop and was overcharged by $30 ($85 vs. $55 that it should have been), which he didn't realize until we were back home--seems the clerk there was operating on less sleep than we were.To be fair, the pool area looked nice and the bellstaff were very understanding and helpful. The other person behind the counter was very nice and promptly had toiletries sent to our room when I requested it.We are both easy going and very polite people and didn't expect 5-star treatment from this hotel, just common courtesy and respect (especially when paying hotel prices for drinks). We stayed at the Marriott Stellaris after the cruise and had a much better experience.

<Content>Double Check the Fine Print We have stayed at this hotel before because it is very close to the San Juan airport and we were only going to be there for under 10 hours. I booked a Net Direct Rate through the hotel site because it had the lowest rate. The rate was $260.39 USD, plus $28.64 for 11% hotel tax. The total rate charged immediately was $289.03. We checked in late in the evening and the desk clerk said everything was paid in full, but wanted to run my credit card through in case we had any incidental charges for the restaurant, etc. I asked him if the room was paid for in advance and he said yes, I did not owe anything. We checked out at 6 AM to rush to the airport, and were presented with an additional fee of 9% of the total. Of course, we paid it, it was under $30, but I think they should mention it on their website. I would have booked the hotel through someone else to avoid the fee. We book all of our trips online and we have never had a prepaid hotel add charges at checkout. The location for the airport is great. The decor is modern. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom smelled musty. It is OK for an overnight stay, but I would not want to stay there for a vacation. The lobby is very loud and all of the rooms open to the lobby. The staff is pleasant. No frills. It is not really convenient to walk to any restaurants other than the ones in the lobby. I think the price was very high for a basic hotel. I also will not book directly through Embassy Suites site again.

<Content>Embassy Isla Verde We stayed at the Embassy suites in Isla Verde, Very nice hotel. We chose this hotel for the convenient breakfast buffet that is included with your stay. No problems with the hotel, staff is great, free internet in the lobby, great food. We didn't like the location, we had to walk about 2 blocks to get to the nearest public beach and it was not the nicest. I noticed the resorts near by had great private clean beaches. If you are not going for the beach close to the hotel then this hotel is GREAT. If you are looking for a hotel with beach do not stay here. This hotel was also about 20 minutes away from Viejo San Juan.

<Content>No complaints, nice pool, but nothing that stands out as great My boyfriend and I stayed at the Embassy Suites for five nights in early December. We chose the Embassy Suites based on a combination of Trip Advisor reviews, the price, the location and the pool and hot tub. Overall, I can't say that we were unhappy with our stay, but we probably would stay somewhere else if we visited Puerto Rico again. We booked through the Hilton website and were quoted $170 per night before taxes, fees, parking etc. After taxes, fees, parking we ended up paying about $220 per night. I knew about the additional expenses in advance, so I wasn't surprised, it just starts to add up. Overall, we found travel in Puerto Rico to fairly expensive vs. the value. Most of the hotels seem to charge extra for parking ($14 per day) and include a 10% per day service charge.The best features of the Embassy Suites are the pool, the breakfast buffet, the manager's reception, the in-room fridge and the free wireless internet. Most of the staff was helpful, and we didn't have any trouble with the maid service. The lobby and courtyard were pretty and overall the hotel seemed to be clean and well-maintained. Our room was a nice size and it was nice to have the two separate areas, but the location of our room wasn't the best. The pool is pretty large, although the water is a little chilly. The hot tub is nice for a hotel. Also, the pool and hot tub were not super crowded when we were there.While in Puerto Rico, we found that the minimum that we spent for a meal was $30, the average was about $50 to $60 and the high end was over $100. Drinks run from about $4 to $5 for a beer to $10 for mixed drinks. That said the breakfast buffet and manager's reception, although not the best, probably saved us some money. Things to be improved upon are the on-site dining options and I wasn't thrilled with the location. We did not try either restaurant on-site, one of which is an Outback Steakhouse, but I heard from others that the food and service were not good. We also didn't spend any time at the casino, but it looked kind of small.The location of the hotel is ok. It is near the airport and some other nicer hotels (El San Juan and the Intercontinental). There is a beach a few blocks away. Carolina/Isla Verde feels fairly suburban and it seemed like there were a lot of business travelers in our hotel. There is a strip that you can walk along that has a few restaurants and there is good access to the highway. Old San Juan is about a 15 minute drive from the hotel. We went to the San Juan Hotel and Casino on a Saturday night and had a lot of fun, there seemed to be a lot of local people there.During my initial search, I couldn't find a hotel in our price range (under $200) in Old San Juan that had the amenities that we were looking for (pool and hot tub). Plus, once we saw Old San Juan, it seems like it might have been pretty noisy to stay in a hotel there. Our other choice was the Marriott, which was slightly more expensive and in Ocean Park. The area around the Marriott was under construction, but the Marriott itself looked nice, is closer to Old San Juan and had some more upscale shopping.We probably would have had a different experience if we stayed in another area, next time if we return we would probably try the Marriott. Again, not a bad experience, just nothing that stands out as great. We also went inside the Holiday Inn, the Intercontinental, El San Juan and El Convento. All were nice, El San Juan seemed to be the most happening, but didn鈥檛 seem as nice as the Intercontinental. El Convento was in a good location and really pretty.Background info on us, we are mid-thirties and take 2 to 3 trips per year. Last December we went to Cancun and the year before we went to Miami and Key West.

<Content>Loved the Embassy Suites!!! I loved the Embassy Suites, they give you two rooms, each room has a tv. The main room has plenty of space for your clothes, etc. two double beds, and the second room is like a sitting room, kitchenette, microwave, and the couch is a bed. The bathroom was expasious, and clean. LOVED IT!!! The breakfast is included, and it is expansive, from cereal, to cook to order. The two hour open bar, is great, they have great music, and excellent service. I am sold on Embassy Suites, their service was excellent, I got checked in early, and was not charged for a later check out. Very accomodating staff.

<Content>Watch out for the surcharge! 2 December 2007I spent three nights in this hotel in early November, 2007. I travel a great deal, several months a year. In my experience this hotel is marginally satisfactory but uninspiring. The room size is a bit cramped but adequate. The decor is rather tired and the furnishings eclectic. The personnel do their jobs - but they do not go much beyond that.The most annoying aspect of this hotel is the 9% surcharge that is imposed on your bill. You are not advised of this surcharge until you arrive at the hotel. When you sign in, you must also sign a statement accepting this charge. At best, the hotel can be accused of false advertising. At worst it is a form of extortion since your only alternative is to take your bags and look for another hotel. The hotel states that the surcharge is to cover local phone calls and web access. I do not use the phone since I have a cell. As for web access, at most hotels it is free or charged at a rate that is considerably less than the cost of the surcharge. (Incidentally, the connection speed is quite slow.) The hotel, although located near the airport, does not even provide shuttle service!Considering these factors and the relatively high room rates and remote location, you would do better looking elsewhere.

<Content>Huge Rooms, Great for Families We just returned from spending the Thanksgiving holiday week at the Embassy Suites. There were three adults and three children traveling in our party so we booked a two bedroom suite. Once we arrived, our check-in was very smooth. Everything was in order and ready without delay.Our rooms were actually a king suite with an adjoining room with two double beds. We had two bathrooms and three TV's! The rooms were very clean. The only reason I did not give the hotel five stars was that the rooms could use a new coat of paint.We loved the huge breakfast every morning. My teenager also loved the virgin pina coladas every night and we enjoyed the adult ones! The pool was great but the water was a little cool. The kids didn't mind and swam every day. It is a beautiful free form pool surrounded by palm trees.We never heard the planes at night and slept wonderfully. the beds were comfortable and many extra pillows were provided.We ate in the Outback twice and once at the bar. We played in the casino which is a bit on the small side but full of nickel slots.We also ate at the Mi Casitas restaurant and had a great meal. It is in walking distance, only two blocks. We walked to the beach which is also two blocks and had a lovely day on Thanksgiving. We thought this beach was better than the Carolina Park Beach.We drove to Old San Juan twice without any problems and drove to the rain forest.The staff at the Embassy was very helpful. The breakfast chef made pancakes for us even though they weren't serving them that day. The front desk clerk made us copies of various restaurant Thanksgiving Day menus in the area. Maintenance came up right away when we had a problem the first night and fixed it.Great hotel, Great staff!

<Content>Very nice...teens loved the buffet My husband stays here on business and we decided to join him this time for a little get away. Although we would have liked to have beach front, this was great. The morning buffet and afternoon manager's reception were great for us as we hung out awaiting my husband's return from work. The kids loved the frozen virgin pina coladas, and we all loved relaxing by the beautiful pool. John at the Waterfall's Restaurant, and Victor at the Outback, both located inside the hotel, were wonderful. They offered so much info about where to go and what to see....as we wanted not only touristy things, but also to enjoy local things. An Embassy staff member gave us information about visiting the bio bay...which was a big help. Our suite was clean and comfy....as much as we loved the made-to-order omelets, it was hard to get out of the comfortable beds each morning. We had a view of the pool from our suite, which was beautiful at night. It is close to the airport, which was convenient. The planes coming in were actually incredible to see. We had a late check-out because my husband had to work that day, and they were very kind about extending our suite availability. We headed off for one last drive to Old San Juan to visit the fort, and they kept our bags for us until we headed to the airport that night. We felt very comfortable there, and yes, we would stay again as a family. If you want great food...(other than the delicious meals at the Waterfall's and the Outback), walk down the block to Mi Casita's and try a mofongo.

<Content>Good value and nice experience ! You get a lot for your money with the included buffet breakfast and managers welcome drinks (2 hrs of free cocktails) every day. The pool is nice and quite large with on site hot tub open between 7am and 10pm. Their are many amenities here, such as a fitness centre, free wireless internet and a small laundry (small daily charge applied). This is a suites hotel, so there are 2 rooms to the suite and includesa fridge and microwave for storing and heating some basic food, great if you have kids !Hotel is 2 blocks from the beach, on the Atlantic coast side of the island, which produced some fun waves to play in. Staff were professional and very friendly and eager to help.Also if you go, make sure you check out the Barcadi factory tour. It'sfree to go in and you get some free samples, but it costs you to get out there, but fun all the same !

<Content>Loved the Embassy experience I read a lot of good reviews about the Embassy and decided to risk it after reading that construction was going on at the El San Juan. Room 416 which we were assigned was a very pleasant surprise. We did not expect a suite with two televisions. Everything was impeccable, the staff helpful and courteous. We checked in on Oct. 20 thru 23, and the details were those we expect from the high end hotels. A newspaper at the door on weekdays, shower heads with several options, the huge array of choices at complimentary breakfast. I had expected something akin to a Continental breakfast. I was blown away by the breakfast choices and small details like a cherry on the plate when the omlette was returned by the cook. The hotel is in an enclave so we walked out to the main street, Ave Isla Verde, and right across the street was the A5 bus to Old San Juan. We still patronized the casino at the El San Juan which is 5 mins away because it is bigger than the casino at the Embassy. My husband said it best, on a scale of 1 to 5, I give them a 10.

<Content>Nice Place Hubby, myself and another couple stayed here from Oct 3 - Oct 8. The rooms were very nice - suites- with a separate living room area. Very confortable beds, roomy bathroom and accomodating service. The pool area was enjoyable, free internet access, nice bar / lounge area and the lobby was tropical with an open atrium  lots of foliage. Free full breakfast available, including ready to order omelettes / eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, bagels, toast, cereals, oatmeal / farina, coffee, juices, etc, etc. More than enough to start the day. Free evening reception which amounted to free drinks for guests from 5:30pm - 7pm. Two blocks walking distance from the beach and other restaurants  hotels. We enjoy walking and after a full dinner, welcomed the opportunity to stroll along Isla Verde Blvd to visit other hotels. We went to two local restaurants: Barrachina  Mi Casita. Both were within walking distance and very flavorful - check them out! Also, we asked them for a recommendation for a local bakery. They gave us directions to Espana Bakery on Calle Marginal Villamar. This bakery is awesome! Only 5 minute drive from the hotel and they had everything from pastries to sandwiches to quiches to hot meals and even liquor. Delicious! We went there the day we were leaving and picked up sandwiches to eat on the airplane. The other passengers were jealous!Down sides - they do not have an airport shuttle. The front desk said that they are not allowed to have it??? Small casino - okay for a novice, but not sure if real players would be satisfied. Daily parking fee for guests ($10 / day). You would think they wouldn't charge guests for parking. An added hotel fee of 9% (or something like that). They attribute this to providing free internet access, free local phone service and other services. Just be aware of this. Not sure if other hotels have started charging the same fee, but the Embassy does. Regardless, we got a great package deal through Orbitz.Over all, service was great. We enjoyed it, and would stay there again.

<Content>Loved the Embassy My husband and I just returned from five days at the Embassy Suites. Service was great. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel is in a great location, not far from the strip if you are interested in having easy access to night life, as well as local resturants. It is cost effective to rent a car. It will pay for itself, by saving you from taxi trips which can cost up to $15.00/per person, as well as from tours which can cost $25.00/pp and up. The complimentary made to order breakfast was great as well as the manager's cocktail hour every evening. They made any drink you requested. Although there was a casino in the hotel, we did not hear the noise, which is great. The facilities were always clean, and staff was good. There is an outback in the restuarant for convenience. Try Mi Casita, Barrachina and Yuqi's. These are all great local restuarants.

<Content>Great Stay I stayed at the Embassy Suites San Juan Hotel in the Isla Verde area of San Juan from August 26th to September 2nd. I had a very nice stay. My room was very clean and the staff was very good. This hotel is not luxurious but it is a very nice hotel. It has a Casino (very busy on weekends), nice pool, Spa, good workout room, an OUTBACK restaurant, breakfast included in the main lobby restaurant everyday, one complimentary beverage a night, good maid service, and it's only a two block walk from the beach and other hotels, restaurants, stores and attractions.The only thing I didn't appreciate was being charged over a hundred dollars for a Hotel Fee whatever that is. When I asked about it, the explanation was ambiguous at best. I guess booking this room online ahead of time didn't mean there wouldn't be other charges. Since I rented a car, parking was $10 a day plus tax.Overall, I had a great stay at this hotel. I would definately go back.

<Content>Not bad at all! My family and I were flying in late and needed a place with two sleeping rooms near the airport and you cant beat the price for that. The bed was amazingly comfortable. The room was clean. The pool was very pretty - they definitely had the tropical decor going on. I wouldnt chose this site for my vacation, but it was nice as a place to lay my head on my way to the west coast.There are free drinks during happy hour - but what a line - not worth it.We had a 4 year old in tow - and this was nice for him. there was even a kiddy pool.Nancy

<Content>"Disappointed" The staff is very helpful....I really enjoyed all their efforts.....The suite was not as clean as I expected it......it looked cleanedbut it had a funny odor, I should have told the staff and I knowthey would have given us a different suite. I believe the ventilationsystem in the room needed attention.I have stayed at this hotel so often, I feel as if I am at home,but this time I noticed some subtle changes, such asthe complimentary cocktail hour lacked the drinks that wereonce provided,,,,such as Pina Colada or Margarita as offeredin the past.....so if you don't drink beer or wine, one must goto the bar and buy your own drinks.I was hit with an onerous and totally unexpected  EXIT tax, which was substantial and sprung on me, without warning on leaving. I had no choice in the matter and felt I was being shook down by thehotel, and I felt I had already paid the appropriate taxes whenpresented with the bill.

<Content>Great Place We stayed at the Embassy Suites from June 30-July 2, 2007. This hotel is located right at the entrance of Luis Munoz Marin International Airport. Accomodations are the best that this hotel has to offer. I am a travel agent and always conduct a site inspection while staying at hotels.This is what I found:Rooms are great. They are suites and they have the bedroom plus the living room (also converted to a bedroom).Pool is great and towel service is excellent. Pool is open until 10:00 PM.If you are in a business travel this is a great place to stay. However, food service is provided basically by Outback Steakhouse which is really good. They also offer for guest, two ours of open bars, in which you can find beers like budlight, budweiser, and Medalla and a lot of drinks. There is free soda, popcorn and snacks also available.The great beach of Isla Verde is 10 minutes walking. I will stay here again. It is a great place for a great price.J . Martinez

<Content>On the way down The hotel is located in Isla Verde, in the Caroline district, which is a great spot. There are restaurants nearby and a grocery store (all within walking distance), and it's only a couple of blocks from the beach. The Outback restaurant in the hotel is great. The casino is small, but if nickel slots are your goal, it'll do. Its downfalls, however, are too numerous to overcome the great location. First, my visit was not as a tourist, but as a business traveler over an extended stay. My employer selected the hotel, not me. My employer also paid the bill, not me. That said, had I selected a hotel and paid the bill, I would have been nothing but disappointed with my choice, and the cost.The hotel is in a slow decline. 1) I opened a drawer at the sink, and it fell apart as it came out. Leaving it on the counter got it fixed prior to my return from a meeting. 2) Like many hotels I've stayed at, there are two banks of elevators. Here, there's a bank of elevators and across the way a single elevator. The single elevator is extremely slow. The 2nd floor and ground buttons stopped working. I was on the 2nd floor, and just started using the stairs. 3) The in-room 'fridge was missing a foot, which meant when you opened the door it tilted toward the missing foot and all items shifted.4) Music from the lobby bar and special events was OUTRAGEOUSLY loud! It was impossible to watch television, read, or look over any documents while sitting in the front room from 8-11 at night (again, I was on business, not a tourist), and a call to the manager two nights in a row did nothing. If you have kids that go to bed early...good luck to you. Ultimately I went to the bedroom and closed the door between the rooms. That certainly took the benefit of a suite out of the picture. I might as well have been at a Super 8.5) The dresser in the bedroom smelled a little like someone had upchucked in it. I decided rather than complain once again I'd handle it by purchasing some air fresheners from the local grocery store. That made my clothes smell like someone had upchucked on them, after they had been freshly laundered. Not a good smell.6) Parking at the hotel was terrible. In the evenings there are events at the hotel and the attendees take up all of the available spaces (except on the roof, where the employees park). Cars are parked on concrete dividers, and in the lanes of travel in behind cars (which can be bothersome when you try to get your spot out of an actual space). If you park, get a space early and don't move your car or you'll be sorry.All in all, I would recommend shopping around for another hotel. If it's only for a short stay, you plan on being gone most of the time (out of the room) anyway, and the cost is what you need, then enjoy.

<Content>Good hotel for the money We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights after a recent cruise. As others have said, it can be tricky to find if you're driving yourself, but once you get your bearings, it's not so bad.We arrived hours before check-in, and although we couldn't get into our room, the hotel stored our baggage so we could go exploring. Once we got into our room, we weren't disappointed... It was a 2-room suite with more than enough room for us and our 6 year old daughter (who was thrilled to have her own room and tv). The room was very clean and looked pretty new. The bed had a fitted sheet on it, which I always like to see in hotels (hate how the flat ones can come off during the night). Our room overlooked the pool (and the highway, which is RIGHT next to the pool), but while I worried about noise from planes or traffic, there was NONE! The same can't be said about noise from INSIDE the hotel. Our first night there (a Sunday), there was a singer and music in the lobby that we heard plain as day in our room. The good thing was, it was over by about 9:30, and after that, all was quiet.The breakfast in the morning offered tons of choices, from omelettes to pancakes to cereal. Something for everyone. Our first morning there was very rainy, and that may have led to the REALLY long breakfast lines. It literally took us 25 minutes to get our food. Yikes! The second morning, though, there was practically no line. Go figure... It would be nice to have the breakfast open later than just 9:30. Seems kind of early for a hotel that has a lot of tourists as guests.Our only real problem with the hotel was that our room was never made up on our full day there. We'd left the hotel at around 9:30 and got back at 3. The room hadn't been touched. Went to the pool for another 2 hours; still nothing. We got a a call at around 5:30 asking if we'd like for them to make up the room for us. At that point, we figured why bother, and just asked for new towels. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel. The pool was very nice, and the staff we ran into were very pleasant. It's walking distance to the beach, is clean and bright, and a good value for the money.

<Content>Just Lovely! This hotel was a little taste of paradise. I actually preferred it over the beach. My friend and I spent most of the time eating and drinking alongside the pool. Don't get me wrong--we swam as well. The lagoon is a spacious pool of 5 ft. that sits right beneath the sun and palm trees. At times, it may be frequented by a bunch of kids, as the hotel seems to attract families. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. We had a leak in the sink and maintenance came right up to fix it. We didn't have to wait. The rooms are spacious and clean, and the bed...the most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel!! I didn't want to leave the bed! The continental breakfast offers pancakes, french toast, omlettes, fruit and all types of sides. The hotel is one block away from the main strip where American fast food restaurants, Walgreens, 7-11, night clubs and other hotels are. Just a few steps further and you're right on the beach! Expedia doesn't mention the hotel service charge, so don't be surprised when you check-in and sign off on 10% extra daily. Will definiately stay again!

<Content>GREAT STAY!! I stayed at this hotel from June 28-July 5th and I plan on going back!I stayed here with 20 family members and we loved it. Having stayed at the El San Juan down the street which is an upscale hotel, I liked this hotel much better, especially traveling with children. The suites were very spacious and very clean. We had a view of the pool which was great and although planes are landing all day long, you cannot hear the planes from your room. The breakfast every morning was a great money saver as well as the managers reception every evening with top notch liquor. Great food and great drinks.....can't beat it!!We ate at Mi Casita which I've eaten at before, the first night the food was WONDERFUL, it was true island food, but our second visit was not as good, there must have been different cooks. Also be ready for slow service at the resaurants and also read your bill before tipping as most restaurants charge 15% gratuity no matter how small the party. We also ate at Levi's at the end of the strip which had good service and food was okay. If your in the mood for fast puerto rican food at a good price, try the Pollo Tropical, also down at the end of the strip.One thing visitors to the Embassy Suites should watch out for is their final bill. The hotel charges you for a 9% hotel fee which includes local calls. Having family in Puerto Rico I did make some calls and also called down to the desk before calling to confirm they were free because of the 9%, I was still billed for each call 1.25 plus tax. So make sure to check your bill, the front desk took it off, but make sure to check and not be overcharged. There were also about 2 proms while we were there,but did not bother us at all, we were on the 4th floor and our room was over the prom area...but again no problems. The beach is 2 blocks down about 5-10 minute walk and Isla Verde Beach is beautiful. I have traveled to Loquillo Beach before but this year Isla Verde Beach was perfect. Overall this hotel was a perfect stay and I definitely plan on visiting again!

<Content>Loved the Happy Hour I picked this hotel based on reviews previously posted here. I LOVED the hotel. It is close to a very nice beach. There are many places to eat out.The hotel is beautiful and very clean. The breakfast buffet was fantastic and I loved the special Pina Coladas at the nightly happy hour. I requested and got a room on the upper floor and I asked for one in the wings and it was nice and quiet even when the lobby was very loud at night, Thanks prior reviewers for suggesting this it was very helpful.The only complaint that I had was regarding the in house restaurant, OutBack Steakhouse. It had incredibly poor service. Very slow and the food did not come out as requested. My suggestion, stay at the hotel but skip the outback. There are plenty of other places to eat at.

<Content>Loud during Prom Week in June!!!!! The Hotel is ok, but during June all the High school kids have there Proms. One Prom would be ok, but 5 Prom in a row while staying directing under the DJ booth!!!!!!!! not fun. If you plan to stay at this hotel, make sure it the higher floors, like the top.

<Content>Rude Staff and Dirty Dishes Await You!! My adult daughter and I stayed at the Embassy Suites in early May 2007 for one night - thank God it was only one night. The thing that I find ridiculous about the rate is they quote you one price but you will end up paying quite a bit more after they tack on all the various taxes and fees (Puerto Rico LOVES fees, fees for EVERYTHING!!!) even the valet parking added taxes and fees to their $16.00 per night (ended up costing $23.00 without a tip) The bellhop sat there looking bored while we struggled with our bags, never offering to help two ladies upon check in. We just blew it off and went to our room. The room itself was fine, okay but we were tucked away at the very back of a wing away from any sort of view that would have made the stay a little nicer. We ordered room service (again, fees fees fees + a delivery charge) and the tray was still sitting outside our room the next day when we checked out. There were room service trays outside many of the doors throughout the hotel during our stay that never moved. It was gross really. Now for the best part, the CASINO staff is really rude, be prepared. We went in to the casino to waste some time and money after a great dinner at Ruth Chris Steak House (recommended highly) and we spent about $300 on slots in the course of several hours before we were offered a drink. I had asked 5 different waitress/wait staff people where I could BUY a drink and they each told me it was someone else's responsibility. So after 2 hours we finally got our drinks and proceeded to gamble. It was my 19 year old daughter's first opportunity to gamble (gambling/drinking age in Puerto Rico is 18) so she was excited and I wanted to take a photo of her pulling the slots...mind you, I had NO idea photography was not allowed in the Casino, there were NO signs anywhere stating this and since I don't normally hang out in casinos, I did not know this was typical for casinos. Well, I took out my pocket camera and started to take a photo of my daughter. A staff member (janitor) came up and smiled at us and said in extremely broken english (I could not begin to understand what he said at all) what I *thought* was oh this is a good place for a picture, isn't it? and I smiled and said yes it is he then started waving his hands around and SCREAMED inches from my face still unintelligible but enough for me to understand this time what he was trying to get across....NO PICTURE, UNDERSTAND!!!! I was stunned and embarrassed. There was NO need to scream at me, I did not understand what he had said originally and since he was smiling when he said it, how was I to know that he was indicating I was doing something wrong. I hate being made to feel stupid, especially by the casino janitor in broken english. This obviously ruined our night. We went to the Hotel Manager and were told there was nothing he could do about it since it happened in the Casino. We went to see the Casino Manager and were told to wait for him, that he was busy. We waited (ignored) for over 40 minutes before we decided to just forget it. I can't believe we were treated so badly and paid all that money to Embassy Suites to get that sort of treatment. Just be aware if you go here, you are going to spend a bundle and may get treated like a chump!!

<Content>Fantastic Girl's Weekend Getaway! Myself and three girlfriends stayed at the Embassy Suites - San Juan May 3rd through May 7th. Visiting Puerto Rico was a first for all of us, so that is why we chose to vacation in PR. And we all agree it was a great choice. The Embassy Suites worked out perfect for us. We booked 2 suites, so each of us had our own bed and only had to share a bathroom with one other person instead of 3 other people. Well worth the extra money spent. The separate living room area worked out perfect for getting ready for dinner and relaxing. The bedroom was very spacious and comfortable.The complimentary breakfasts were fine. Some food items better than others, but you can't really complain when you don't have to leave the hotel and it is included with your room. The nightly manager's cocktail party was definitely worth visiting each night. They gave you 2 drinks each time you went up and the lines moved pretty quickly. The bartenders were friendly and gave heavy pours! Always a huge plus! One thing we did learn is when ordering a hamburger from the Atrium Restaurant, make sure you order it well not medium well because ours was still raw. The pool area was great. While we were there hardly anyone used the pool, so you always had your choice of spots to lay in the sun by the pool. Although we never actually saw the pool bar open, which would have been a nice to have been able to order a cool beverage by the pool, but we survived without them. The beach is a quick 5 minute walk from the hotel. And the majority of the restaurants and bars are very close as well. We walked at night to and from the hotel and never felt unsafe in the area. (I don't condone walking around at night, because crime still does happen, but we never felt nervous.)Some of the best bars we visited were the lounges and nightclub at the El San Juan Hotel. Very fun and lively. Definitely check this place out and dress accordingly. Pretty upscale but beautiful, especially the bordello salon. Club Liquid at the Beach  Water Club Hotel was a nice place as well. It is on the rooftop. Very pretty skyline and beach view. We visited Old San Juan which was incredibly beautiful. We went one afternoon there. We all wish would have been able to spend more time exploring this area. The restaurants and bars looked like a lot of fun. I definitely come back to the Puerto Rico and the Embassy Suites. Wonderful vacation!!

<Content>Could be improved The hotel is lovely and the rooms are very clean. It is in a great location and easy to walk to the beach and restaurants. The breakfast leaves some to be desired and ends far too early for people who are on vacation. The staff members are friendly once you can get their attention. They definitely could be more attentive. My largest gripe is that they charge a 9% fee upon check-out for internet usage and pool toys! Their website mentions this fee but since I booked directly through the hotel I assumed that it was included in my bill. I have never heard of a hotel charging such a high fee after the fact. I am just upset that they did not mention this when I called and they are so sneaky about adding it at the end.

<Content>Worth the money My mother, husband  I and our four children (6 and under) stayed at this fantastic hotel. It is pricey but the stay was worth it. The beach and a lot of restaurants  shops are in walking distance. The breakfast buffet was excellent. They even make you an omelet if you want. This hotel does get full so at times it was difficult to find seating. In the afternoons, they provide complimentary drinks and snacks. We don't drink alcohol but they provided non-alcoholic pi帽a-coladas and other fruit drinks which we all enjoyed. The hotel lobby is beautiful and the staff very attentive. We were there for two weeks and a few minimal things came up but once we addressed the staff everything was taken care of quickly. The pool is fantastic. They have a waddling pool for the little ones as well. Room service was good (plentiful and hot). My husband did try the Steakhouse in the hotel with some friends and he states the service and food were good. A negative note is that the washing machines and dryers weren't all working. Four machines were working out of 8 or 10. Several times I tried to use the machines and it didn't wash or dry well (left everything unclean/ soaking wet). For a hotel so large they should keep up with its maintenance. They did refund the money we lost. On the weekends they have live music, which is nice but when you are trying to get your toddlers and newborn to sleep it doesn't help at all. Next time we will request a higher floor level and to have a room in one of the inner hallways. We will most definitely return to stay here again. It has been the best hotel experience, in all of our visits to PR.

<Content>Inconsistent and... This was our second stay at this hotel. We had a very nice room which overlooked the pool. However, I think this will probably be our last stay at this property and in San Juan in general. Hotel: The breakfast, which was so fabulous last year, has taken a step back. They used to make omelettes in omelette pans and they were great. Now, they make them on the grill, using cylinders to keep them round. Well, I ordered two, and each time the outside of the omelette came out overcooked and the inside was raw. Additionally, it was amazing how many times the cooks made mistakes as to who had ordered which omelette. It was like they had never worked at this job before. Also, the lines were very long each and every morning. The cocktail reception in the evening, always a nice plus, has also taken a step back. No longer will they make blender drinks, as in the past. Additionally, like the breakfast, the lines are very long. The pool is very nice. However, the surface outside the pool is inexplicably slippery and dangerous. I mean, who would construct a pool like that? Time and time again, I saw people, especially little children, fall. Some toddlers even fell back, banging their heads. If you have little children, you must stay on top of them and insure they don't run (very difficult to do with kids). I'd be willing to bet, sadly, that this pool has seen its share of serious accidents. Also, there is no lifeguard, which is a shame. The location of the hotel is not great, but we knew that going in. It is about a ten minute walk to the beach (straight ahead). On the way to the beach is mall on Avenue Isle Verde. Just be careful, when walking with small children, of the metal spikes that line the sidewalk and the entrance to the parking lot to the mall (another construction decision that I fail to understand). Staff: This is the most perplexing part of this hotel and of Puerto Rican people in general. I don't know if it's an aloofness, language miscommunication, or intelligence issue. But, the service was not very attentive, and mistakes and misinformation permeated our stay. Examples:Me: Do you have to pay for children on the bus?Front Desk: I don't know, I don't have any children; andMe: What have you heard about the Asian restaurant next door in the Holiday Inn?Front Desk: I have never eaten there; andMe: What time does the pool bar close (question asked at 3:40 pm)?Pool Bar Bartender taking my order: 3 pm; andMe: How long does it take to get to the Condado using the bus (a 3 mile trip)?Bellhop: Over one hour.Me: But, it's such a short trip.Bellhop: The bus makes lots of stops.There are many more examples. A waitress in the Outback Steakhouse (inside the hotel) was rude and incompetent. She brought the wrong order, took 20 minutes to bring our dessert, and made us wait another 20 minutes to get the check. All of this without an apology. Also, the service at the fast food restaurants in the mall is not only very slow (1/2 hour just to get some chicken at Church's), but also inept. The orders there and everywhere were wrong every time. The casino staff was also not very pleasant and unprofessional. A blackjack dealer misdealt a hand and the Pit Boss just got rid of the cards instead of making things right. No sorry or even an acknowledgment that the players were wronged. Same situation at El San Juan Hotel. The blackjack table decides to change the minimum from $10 to $25. So what do they do? Grandfather the players already gambling? Of course not. Just kick everyone off of the table!Be aware, that even though English may be an official language of the territory, and many service people allegedly speak and understand English, Spanish is what's spoken in Puerto Rico. Learn some Spanish before you go. Misc. Notes: There is an excellent supermarket called Pueblo, just a short walk from the hotel. When leaving the hotel, make a sharp right and walk along the highway exit and then make a left at the corner. Pueblo is great for stocking your fridge with drinks, lunch foods, and snacks. Why pay the high prices of the hotel? Get a small, soft cooler and you will be able to keep your drinks cold while at the pool or beach.The Asian restaurant next door at the Holiday Inn is excellent. It's a bit pricey, but the food is great and the service, unlike everywhere else, was outstanding. Also, Metropol, for authentic Puerto Rican and Cuban food, is nice. It has a kid's menu, is reasonable, and you eat among locals, which is great. While nothing fancy, it is worth a visit. Make a right on Avenue Isle Verde and walk down about 1/2 mile, just past the cock fighting arena. Conclusion: As I stated earlier, this may be our last trip to San Juan. It is an easy flight and inexpensive, which makes it attractive. But, we were in search for beauty. I've been told that Puerto Rico has some beautiful beaches. Well, those beaches do not exist in San Juan. The beach on the Condado is not nice. Isle Verde Beach, which many guidebooks say is beautiful, is not that at all. Isle Verde beach has lots of pollution in its sands. When we were there, there was an influx of seaweed. While I'm sure the seaweed isn't always present, the debris from the sand doesn't go away. The beach is mediocre because of the debris. I'm hoping that in other parts of Puerto Rico, Rincon for example, the beaches are as they are pictured and described in the guidebooks. That is why, if I come back to Puerto Rico, while I may fly into San Juan, I'm renting a car and searching for some real beauty, because the beauty is not in San Juan.

<Content>very satisfied Just returned from a girls' trip to Puerto Rico. We stayed for 5 nights at the Embassy Suites, as many other hotels are in renovation. With four women, it was a wise choice! The hotel is centrally located for the beach and activities of Isla Verde. Parking costs $10 a day, which is economical for the area. Cabs are also readily available for all of the sites. We were checked in early, despite arriving over an hour before official check-in time, to a good sized room. The room was very clean and serviced well each day, including special requests. We did find one roach during the stay. The front desk staff and bar staff were very friendly. The hotel has a great pool, which has music on the weekends. Unfortunately, the cocktail and food service at the pool is a bit irregular and ends at 3pm, which is disappointing. The free happy hour, standard with Embassy Suites, was quite a draw, and we had to wait in a long line for drinks. Thankfully, they were more than accomdating for two drinks when we reached the front of the line! ;-) The free breakfast is too early for vacation travelers, but we did manage to hit it one day and were very satisfied. For a smaller group, I may stay somewhere else, but with a large group, I would definitely stay again.

<Content>Great Hotel Convinietly located near the airport and in a nice area. Lots of restaurants close by. It is about 5 minute walk from the beach too. The staff were all courtious and helpful. Room was very clean although it needed a fresh coat of paint. The breakfast buffet was excellent and convinient. We enjoyed having Outback restaurant in the lobby too!The pool area was nice with waterfalls etc. There was a gym and the hotel also had a coin laundry facility... very nice for people staying there longet than a few days...We would definitely stay there again- a good value.

<Content>Loved the Embassy Suites and Staff We had a great time at the Embassy Suites. Although our first night there they were overbooked, they paid for us to stay at the Courtyard Marriot up the road. They provided us with a huge room with a balcony on the beach. The next day we arrived back at the Embassy Suites. They were so kind to us. They upgraded our room for free. They brought a fruit basket, free drink tickets, and gambling vouchers. The staff was wonderful and so are the amenities!

<Content>Excellent Quality and friendly We recently stayed at Embassy Suites April 4-8th. It was a quick getaway during spring break for our boys, 9 and 12. We made the reservation thru the Hilton website and used a AAA discount. We decided to stay here based on various reviews and the fact that breakfast was included with the deal. I hate having to wander around in order to find food in the morning, especially with kids. It was also close to the airport so that we could get there sooner and leave later. The cab ride is fixed to various hotel zones and ours was $10.50. Check in was quick and the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was a connecting suite with a living room in the middle. One room had a king bed, the other, two double beds for the boys. We thought about the cheaper option of putting them on the sofa bed but we're glad we didn't. The sofa bed is fairly lame and our boys likely would have been kicking each other thru the night. This way they had their own bathroom and TV. We paid $379/night plus taxes. You could stay here for less than that easily but have only one main bedroom and sleeper sofa in the living room. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. The service thruout the hotel was excellent. We really didn't go to the pool much but opted for activities and the beach. The pool is decent but seemed crowed at times. The beach is two blocks away and an easy walk. We liked the beach at Isla Verde and thought it was better than Loquillo. You can rent an ubrella for $10/d and chairs for $4/d. The breakfasts were good, not great, but very convenient, with enough variety for everybody. We went early, 8am, when crowds were not too bad. There was also snacks and drinks served from 530pm to 7pm each night. The resturants in the area are decent but not great. We did not eat at the most expensive places being with the kids. We liked the idea of eating Puerto Rican food although some of the places were slightly dirty in our opinion. We ate at Metropol and Mi Casita which again were decent and inexpensive but could have been cleaner. We had sushi one night at Momoyama in the Intercontinental hotel which was good. All of the above were in walking distance from hotel. Other activities included taking a cab to El Morro which was excellent($20 cab ride each way), renting a car and going to El Yunque and Loquillo beach(pretty good), and taking the sailing and snorkeling trip with EastWinds Catamaran(kid friendly) which was excellent. The only thing that I would consider doing differently is perhaps staying closer to the east coast, such as the Westin or Las Casitas. We were scheduled to do the bio bay but were too tired after the snorkeling. I didn't want to drive back the next day, but if closer, would have considered it. Overall it was a good, quick vacation with warm weather. Certainly better that NJ which had temps in the 40's.

<Content>Great for short family stay Our family stayed here for 2 nights after spending 6 days on Culebra Island, PR. After enjoying the spartan accommodations there, our 2 bedroom/2bath suite (plus living room) at the Embassy Suites seemed luxurious. The beds were extremely comfortable and the bath products were higher quality than you find at most chain hotels. All the staff were genuinely accommodating.The free breakfast, although not spectacular, offered lots of choices and quantity. Skip the complimentary happy hour -- the appetizers were popcorn and snack mix.The pool is great for kids. The beach is an easy five minute walk. Even though the airport is just minutes away, the noise isn't offensive outside -- and inside I never heard a thing.I can't imagine staying here unless you are with children or at a business function (even though there's a casino). And I wouldn't choose it for a Puerto Rico destination hotel. But its a great stopover for a few days on your way in or out of San Juan.

<Content>Very Nice We didn't stay here; stayed next door at the Holiday Inn; but we walked over the Embassy to visit the casino and the Outback steakhouse. This hotel was very nice from what we experienced. The lobby is a lush garden and very inviting. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Check it out!

<Content>great trip we were at the embassy suites in isla verde from march 8-11. The hotel its self was decent.. .nothing spectacular, but no problems. We paid 359 per night... for a suite which housed 5 people easily. There were two full sized beds in the bedroom and one pullout sofa in the living roon. The breakfast buffet is a must with eggs, bacon, sausage, and all the fixins. there is even an omlette bar where you pick your own ingredients. The hotel is very close to the airport, but i didn't here one plane go by, even though i can see the planes from my room window. The cost for taxi from the airport to the hotel should be 12 bucks... unless you have 4+ people. the cost to cab it to old san juan was 20 one way. The hotel pool was good... but there was no beach that it leads onto. The hotel is about 1.5 blocks from the beach..... so no direct access from the hotel. The hotel did have a casino which i didn't use much so i can't comment on it... but drinks are free if you play at the tables for some length of time. There was an outback steakhouse in the hotel which was good to see after a very disapointing outing at a local restaurant where i tried th Mofongo.... which believe me sounds a lot better than it is. One thing that i recommend everyone to do before they leave is goto the rainforest and stop by the Bio Bay in Frajoda(sp). We went there on a boat with 16 in the group. When we first got there it wasn't much of a site.. until you get into the water....I'm not much of a swimmer, but i put on a life vest and ventured into the darkness ... the further away from the boat i got.. the more intense the glo was...it was one of the most AMAZING things that i have ever seen. Make sure you go there late at night... We didn't actually jump into the lake until about 11:00 pm. But it is a must for anyone coming to PR. They have other bio bay's around PR, but the one in Frajoda was the closest... and we were able to go there right after the rainforest. The water was said to have 4x the salt concentration as the ocean, so not much was living in the lake besides the glo organisms. A plus for you ladies... and men also is that your skin will be baby soft after you wash off the salt remains.by the way .. the photos above are pretty good representations of the hotel

<Content>Rewarding experience We stayed four nights in early March 2007. This hotel delivers on what it advertises. Friendly check-in; attractive lobby area, very nice suites, outstanding service, a very generous breakfast and happy hour, a fine pool and spa, and a fun casino. Five minute ride from the airport, two blocks from the beaches. Plenty of restaurants in the area. Easy car rental nearby and convenient to the major highways. The Internet access was nice, too.

<Content>A nice enough hotel This property is somewhat difficult to find if you drive there yourself. Once you get your bearings, though, it is not difficult to find at all, but traffic on Isla Verde can be overwhelming. Parking is in a garage adjacent to the property, and will cost $10/night. The room was just what you can expect from an ES property...large suite, comfortable bed, large bathroom, microwave, refridgerator. Nothing special, but nonetheless a very comfortable place to stay. There is wireless internet access (for a fee) that works very well. Breakfast is very good, and so is the managers reception, although that was very crowded. There is an Outback Steakhouse in the hotel. Otherwise, other restaurants are a 5-10 minute walk away. The beach is a 5 minute walk.The property has a large and unusually shaped pool with a seperate hot tub. Be forewarned: The hot tub is HOT!I would stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel We recently spent 3 nights at this hotel. We were wary, since it wasn't a beachfront hotel, and we have had bad experiences with Puerto Rico hotels before (El Conquistador, in particular).We were thoroughly delighted with the hotel, the staff, the amenities, etc. The staff went out of their way to make sure that our stay was pleasant. The hotel is a typical Embassy Suites, with a 2 room suite setup (living area and bedroom). The free buffet breakfast was substantial (hot and cold foods), free happy hour each night (a variety of wine, beer, liquor), free wireless internet throughout the hotel areas (including pool), free business services (fax, internet, etc). They even have a kiosk in the lobby to print out your boarding passes. The hotel is an easy 5 minute walk to the beach.All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in San Juan.

<Content>Staff The staff really needs to be reconsidered. While I was staying at the Embassy Suites, I had all sort of trouble and they either kept me ignored or came up with a temporary solution until I left. That is not the way to treat a guest.

<Content>We loved Embassy Suites San Juan We stayed at the Embassy Suites from February 12, 2007 to February 16, 2007. We chose the Embassy Suites based on reviews on Trip Advisor. Thank you! Before we finished stepping into our room on our day of arrival, the telephone was ringing to make sure our room was satisfactory and to again welcome us to Puerto Rico and to the hotel. The staff could not do enough for you, every one of the staff made you feel welcomed. The room was cleam, the bed so very comfortable. The hotel is a short taxi ride to Old San Juan and many attractions, and 2 blocks from the beach and a few minutes to the airport. You may choose to stay at a more fancier hotel, but you will not get better service or treated better. We were working on our return plans before we landed back at home.

<Content>Embassy Suites A Great Deal Stayed here for 5 nights over President's weekend at $300 a night because the hotel that we usually stay in was charging $450. a night. Convenient to airport. Noise of planes and highway nearby didn't bother us. Poolside waterfalls and music tend to mask noise. Pool area is very nice with hot tub, kiddie pool, bar with food service, tables, plenty of lounges so you can get a seat even if you don't get there until 9:00-9:30 AM. Buffet breakfast was excellent with made to order eggs, fruit, yogurt, breads, juices, meats. Manager's cocktail party every night for 2 hours with free drinks, pretzels, chips, etc. Restaurants are somewhat limited (Outback on premises and Embassy kitchen). We took taxis to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse (expensive) at Intercontinental Hotel, Il Mulino (expensive) at Ritz Carlton, The Ranch (moderate) at El San Juan Hotel. The Holiday Inn is directly across street and Asian restaurant there is reasonable priced and very good. You can save a lot of money on lunch by walking one block to small shopping center which has a Burger King, Subway, bakery, mini market, ice cream store, Ponderosa. We found the Embassy Suites to be very family oriented.One Complaint----when we went to check out, there were two taxes on our bill which came to about $50 a day additional. We had booked on their website which stated that there was only an 11% tax. They have added on a new tax since January 1, 2007 but they took this tax off our bill since we had booked before that date and brought our printout with us.

<Content>What you'd expect from a 3-star hotel Embassy Suites Hotel is an average hotel, with some nice features for the $$. I usually like to stay at more upscale resorts, but this was a last minute trip booked with friends.Pros:-This hotel is literally 5 minutes from the airport so the cab fare is about 12 dollars-Breakfast is inlcuded and they have fruit, omlettes, cereal, french toast, eggs, etc. It is also served until 10am, which is nice.-Drinks at the pool are cheap-Free cocktails from 5:30-7:30-Very close to El San Juan HotelCons:-Casino is TINY-Noise from the airport is slightly annoying while at the pool-Maid service was erratic (one day they didn't come until 6pm) and we sent them away because we all needed to shower and get ready for dinner.-Bathrooms were definitely in need of an upgrade (lots of chipped tile/grout)Overall this is a perfect place if you want an inexpenseive hotel with some free drinks. I would not stay here again unless I was on a budget. There's much more going on at the El San Juan Hotel and it's much nicer. We did overpay for this hotel since we went over MLK weekend, but it served it's purpose. Pool area was nice, drinks were great, and people were warm and friendly.

<Content>Wonderful customer service We just got back from a weekend at this hotel and were very impressed. In fact, we booked it because of other positive reviews we found on TripAdvisor! The staff here were very accomodating and friendly. I requested a room above the 4th floor facing the pool and they switched us right away. The hotel is a short walk to the beach and although Isla Verde doesn't have too many attractions, we found this to be a good base. Everything was clean and the breakfast buffet had a good selection.The only thing I wasn't impressed with in this area of San Juan was the high price of taxis. This obviously had nothing to do with the hotel; but I was surprised that a 5 minute drive from the airport cost us $10. A short drive to Old San Juan (about 8-10 minutes away) was $20. We tried to negotiate but were told by the hotel reception that different cabs charge different rates and that's just the way it is.Other than that, though, we had a fabulous stay!

<Content>Just got back from a week stay. Well my husband and I just got back from Puerto Rico and we stayed an entire week at the Embassy Suites. I've read other reviews before I left and they are fairly accuriate. It is very close to the airport and while at the pool you do occasionall hear them; however I never heard them in my room. ( We were in room 736). We did hear music in the outer-room in the evenings, but back in the bedroom we didn't hear it. We had a view of the ocean ( as much as you can from that hotel in between buildings). We didn't go to the beach near by until the last evening. We walked there, it is a block away and you do have to cross a busy street, but it wasn't bad. It was nice to have the breakfast at the hotel, you didn't have to drive around and worry about that part of our trip. We did go to the happy hour a few times and that was very enjoyable. I would recommend this hotel and if we ever return to Puerto Rico I'd be happy staying there again.

<Content>Embassy suites offers good value for the price. We stayed here in December '06 for a one night pre-cruise visit.We booked online well in advance and got an excellent rate of $150.00 a night. The room was spacious and clean, the front desk personnel were friendly and accomodating, and the free extras result in a superlative value in this relatively expensive neighborhood. You can take the money you save and make a donation in the on-site casino. There is a manager's reception/ happy hour offering free drinks and snacks for 1 1/2 hours each evening and a free breakfast is also offered each day. The breakfast is served buffet-style with eggs made to order, bacon and sausage, an assortment of pastries, hot and cold cereals, bagels, muffins, breads, fruit, juices, coffee and tea. If two people had to pay for the extras independently they would surely cost as much or more than the entire cost of the room. The beach is a few short blocks away. There is a wondeful outdoor pool that was never crowded. There is also an Outback Steakhouse in the hotel and the prices are very reasonable. The Ritz-Carlton, which is just a few blocks away, offers a Friday night seafood buffet that can't be beat. It's a bit pricey but well worth the expenditure. Another excellent restaurant in the neighborhood is the Metropol; also just a few blocks away. They serve Cuban, Caribbean and Puerto Rican cuisine in a family-friendly atmosphere at reasonable prices. Taxis are readily available and when we were ready to head to the cruise pier, there were several van-size taxis waiting there which were able to accomodate our entire party and all our luggage. We will definitely stay here again as the cost is low and the value is high. Discerning travelers will appreciate the friendly service and overall value offered by this hotel.

<Content>good and bad The hotel staff was friendly and helpful even letting us check in before check-in time. We couldn't get our boarding passes to print and the on-duty manager took time from his duties to print it for us. The hot morning breakfasts were filling and delicious and the evening cocktails were plentiful and above average. The hotel is beautiful and the pool area is outstanding. We had a bathroom leak and the repairman was there practically before we got off the phone with the manager. However there was a strong sewer smell in the bathroom which never went away. Sound carries in this hotel. Doors would shut with a bang. Loud music blared most of the night which made sleeping difficult. The manager explained that it was because it was the holiday season but that didn't make our lack of sleep any easier to take. Still it is possible that the music was a holiday thing so willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.

<Content>Perfect hotel for pre-cruise stay We stayed at this hotel for 2 days prior to a cruise. The hotel we normally stay at was closed for renovation, so we chose Embassy Suites mainly for the price, 189.00 per night, which included full breakfast each morning ( not just pastries and coffee, I mean full breakfast, omlets cooked to order, pancakes, etc...) There was also free drinks at night, but being we don't drink, we didn't go to that. There was an Outback Steakhouse right at the hotel which was very convenient the first night we stayed, as we were tired from traveling,  didn't want to go far to get something to eat. We also ate lunch at the grill off of the lobby for lunch. The food was very good,  the service was top notch. Even though this hotel isn't on the beach, their pool area was very nice,  we enjoyed relaxing there. Also, this hotel is very close to the airport, but we hardly ever heard the planes. There are many restaurants  stores within walking distance, which was extremely convenient for us to pick up some snacks  sundries to take on our cruise that we had forgotten to bring. Our room was very clean  having the extra room was nice. The king size bed was extremely comfortable, probably one of the best matresses i've ever slept on while traveling. All in all, we were very pleased with this hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel...Met and exceeded expectations This hotel was wonderful! Very clean with an excellent staff. Didn't hear any airport noise. Didn't hear anyone on the first floor. Location is good if you need to go to the drug store and pick up some last minute items. Only about 3 block away. Loved the Happy Hour. Loved having an Outback in the hotel. We used for a pre-cruise. If we ever go back to San Juan, we will definitely use the hotel again.

<Content>Nice hotel, but EXTREMELY loud weddings, parties all night This hotel was wonderful expect that they have weddings, parties,etc. on the 1st floor and the music was extremely loud. My mom and I stayed here before a cruise and had a really tough time sleeping. The music blasts through the hotel until at least 3 - 4am. We also had a problem checking in. We had requested 2 beds and when we checked in around 6pm they were sold out so we were forced to share a bed. Not a huge deal for us but I could see it being a pain for familes that weren't planning on all cramming into the same bed. The breakfast was wonderful, the service was great, the pool was amazing but becuase of the loud muisc throughout the night I wouldn't stay here again. If you plan to party all night this would be the place to be. Or, if the hotel could stop the music at an earlier hour I would be willing to come back.

<Content>Great Hotel, Fabulous Service, They know Hospitality We stayed at this hotel before a cruise and made a reservation for another hotel for our post cruise because Embassy did not have availability. Well when we checked into the other hotel to simply relax and enjoy our last days of vacation, we were checked into dirty rooms, yes more than one and not just dirty, beds made but the sheets had not been changed from the previous guest we were moved to another room and found the same problem. We called Embassy to check if there were available rooms and thank the good lord above they had a room for us. We checked out of the dirty run down hotel and happily waited for a clean room at the Embassy Suites. We had dinner and had the pleasure of being served by the loviest woman that had such gracious and hospitible skills and made us feel welcomed. Later in our room a knock at the door, room service delivering a beautiful plate of sliced fruit with a large bow and an apology for the inconvenience that we had experienced....At Another Hotel!....This was perfect and such a classy touch on what already measured up to be one great hotel. The front desk staff was top notch and I look forward to our next trip to Puerto Rico and another stay at the Embassy Suites Hotel.Thank you for everything...See you again soon!

<Content>Beautiful Hotel The hotel was beautiful, the staff was great. The bar was closed my first day out at the pool but once it was open that kicked up the trip a noch. The hotel is close to the airport and local bus to old san juan. I had a great time, I would recommend and will be returning soon. TT New Hampshire

<Content>A Great Value Just returned from a family vacation/birthday celebration in PR. We stayed at the Embassy Suites for 3 nights over the Thanksgiving holiday. Many of the previous posts accurately described our stay. The rooms were VERY CLEAN, the staff was FRIENDLY and HELPFUL (Ian was great). When we requested a room with a view, we were given a suite on the 8th floor overlooking the pool, a body of water (wasn't the ocean?) and could see the mountains in the distance. Very nice. Although I prefer beach front hotels, oceanview rooms and balconies, the Embassy Suites (which doesn't have any of these) still delivered a tropical feel.The location was good; didn't mind being next to the airport. We couldn't hear the planes at all inside the hotel, but could outside at the pool. Urban dwellers won't miss a beat. We rented a car so the location was great, next to the highway and main Isla Verda drag.Foodies will not be impressed with the breakfast buffet or manager's nightly reception. Definitely quantity over quality. The buffet is reminiscent of college cafeteria food. Vegans should skip the buffet all together, unless bring your own rice/soy milk for cereal. Ask for the basic mixed drinks and you will fare well, ie., rum and coke. Also be strategic, because the lines can be very long -- which cancels out free because your time/energy is worth something, especially on vacation. Run over to the El San Juan for GREAT mixed/frozed drinks and atmosphere.Definitely a great group/family hotel when you have to accomodate various budgets.

<Content>Embassy at in 10 We just finished a 5 night stay at the Embassy suites, stayed on the 3rd flr facing the pool, nice and quiet at night. Things could not have been better. Great cooked to order breakfast everyday and the 2hr managers cocktail hour was super. Drinks a plenty...We wondered across the street to the Holiday Inn to eat in J.H.Yee's Asian Bistro. This was the BEST asian food we have ever eaten. We have eaten in New York's and San Francisco's chinatowns this was better. Service was great and the waiter staff very attentive. It was so good we went back again before leaving for home. I highly recommend the peking duck, it was a 10 plus. Ask for Zayvette....Enjoy.

<Content>Our PR Home away from Home I've been reading reviews at least 3-4 times a week since I booked this hotel in April 2006! We stayed here from Oct. 6-8. I am extremely satisfied with my stay here and paying attention to the reviews was well worth it. It is a 3-4 min ride from the Airport. Lobby is beautiful with a rainforest atmosphere. The atrium style setting of trees and small waterfalls is very relaxing. Pool in the back is nice with a jacuzzi and kids pool. And although the highway is behind the pool, it didn't bother us at all. Its kind of hidden by all of the trees. Also, we only heard like 2 airplanes our whole stay-but after living in New York, who cares! Breakfast is just as other reviews said; satisfying with all breads, juices, tea, coffee, cereals, fruits, and regular fare, as well as made to order omelets, waffles and pancakes. Yes, definitly get there between 7:30-8:30 because after that it does get crowded-towards the end, you may not even be able to find a seat, and there are plenty of seats! We ate enough every day last until dinner. Internet is $9.95 per day, so if you need to use it, make sure you understand it will be charged to your room or credit card. Live music nightly and just a walk to a local Ponderosa, Mi Casita  the other resort/hotels on the strip, plus a grocery store. We stocked up on water and fruits. Having the fridge and microwave is a big plus. For your El Yunque tour, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Rafael from PR 4 LESS. Ask Bo, or the other managers/staff to hook you up with him. He really enjoys taking people through the island, and if you're hungry after, he'll take you to a real authentic PR roadside stand/restaurant to eat. That was one of the greatest parts of our trip. I will definitly return to Embassy Suites. Not only are the rooms/accomodations great for the price, but it felt like coming home every night. We moved over to the Ritz Carlton after our 2 nights here and although the Ritz is beautiful, probably best for honeymoon/anniversary vacations, the atmosphere is kind of stuffy with a lot of business people. Embassy has a very relaxed feel. There are a lot of families that stay here, and it is also a spot for locals on the weekends. The staff is not afraid to talk to you, and smile at you, and for that we can't wait to go back.

<Author>LiamsMommy
<Content>It had everything we needed! Thanks to everybody who took the time to review this place. I read all of your reviews and took a lot of the advice I found here. My husband and our 3 year old son stayed at this property from October 6th - October 11th and we had a great time. We arrived way before check-in time and she said she had some rooms available but I told her that I wanted the quietest room available so my son could sleep. We were given room 722 which was in a corner overlooking the pool and the expressway. Some of the negatives that were mentioned in previous reviews are true.  Yes - The hotel is located next to the airport but we didn't hear the planes too much when we were in our room. You can hear the planes land from the pool area but it didn't bother us too much. Yes - The pool area is right next to an off-ramp of a highway but it's camoflauged by palm trees. We live in a city so we are used to the sounds of cars going by. Yes - The hotel has a salsa singer every night from 6:00pm on and the atrium amplifies the noise. We could hear her singing on the 7th floor in our sitting area but when we went into the bedroom and closed the door we couldn't hear it anymore. For the price and everything you get we were really happy with the hot and cold selections at breakfast and we LOVED the happy hour. I'm guessing that during the busy season the lines could get REALLY long but it wasn't that way for us. On two nights we got Outback Steakhouse takeout and had dinner in the bar area while enjoying the happy hour. We are not really beach people but we walked to it twice. I would say that it's a three block walk and you do have to cross one busy street but that cars will stop. The Pueblo supermarket was a five minute walk and was just like the markets at home but even nicer. As there's a mini-fridge and microwave in the room you can really stock up. A lot of reviews mentioned Mi Casita restaurant my husband liked it but I liked the Metropol restaurant more. (I think my husband liked that Mi Casita was less expensive) The pool area itself was nicely landscaped and laid out but it could have been cleaner. My son is an early riser so often we'd be down at the pool at 7:00am and there would still be debris from the previous evening still outside. That's my one gripe about the property. One day we had to wait an hour for fresh pool towels. Our family had a wonderful time and agreed that a 5 or 6 day stay was a perfect amount of time as the hotel is on the smallish side. Hope this helps! Enjoy your vacation!

<Content>Free Cocktails and Breakfast! The Wyndham San Juan is the perfect place to stay. Its adjacent to the airport and only 2 blocks from the beach. The hotel is clean, comfortable and features a contemporary decor. Each room has two beds plus a sofa-bed and includes a wet bar, microwave and small refrigerator. Probably the best part is the complimentary cocktail hour and complimentary breakfast.Our group of 12 people booked 3 rooms for one night prior to departing on a cruise. It was a perfect pre-departure party for us as the hotel offers a complimentary managers cocktail reception every day from 5pm to 7pm. They offer a variety of cocktails, featuring premium liquors as well as frozen drinks. They also include free chips and salsa and snack mix. The complimentary breakfast features a variety of standard breakfast foods; french toast, sausage, home fries, scrambled eggs, cereal, breads and made-to-order omelettes. The bell man was really friendly and offered numerous suggestions for good restaurants and night life. We walked one block to Mi Casita, a local restaurant in a small strip center. It featured local food at reasonable prices. The restaurant was clean, the food was well-prepared and the service was good. The hotel pool is beautiful, in a resort-style setting. On another note, I have to point out its probably best to request a room AWAY from the elevators. This floor is ceramic tile and very noisy with foot traffic. Overall this is a great hotel with a fun atmosphere in a great location.

<Content>Loved staying at the Embassy Suites We stayed at the Embassy Suites for 9 days the last week of August 2006. We really enjoyed everything about this Hotel and the staff well very accomodating. The complimentary breakfast was great and the Happy Hour every evening was very enjoyable. We only had the chance to use the pool once as we drove around the island to enjoy some great beaches. The pool was beautiful. I also liked that we were able to take towels from the pool area to use for the day when we went out for the day. Can't wait to come back and stay here again.

<Content>Great for a group! The stay at Embassy was perfect for us! We were 12 people and needed a nice location and nice price. The hotel is walking distance to the beach, $20 to Old San Juan and has a beautiful pool. The breakfast is included-but is not that great....there's also a happy hour which makes for a fun activitiy after being in the sun all day. Definitely check out old San Juan. The water club Wet Bar is fun for dancing and drinks since it is on the rooftop of the Water Club hote. Also, check out Baru for an AMAZING meal...Parrot Club and Dragonfly are pretty good too!

<Content>Great Value My family stayed at the Embassy Suites at both legs of a cruise. We were greeted by a very friendly staff that quickly had our bags in our room. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. Cabs are waiting outside so there was no waiting for when we decided to go into Old San Juan for brunch. (One of the staff reccomended the Parrot Club and the food and service was great.) The pool area is pretty big and clean. We had dinner at the Outback which is located on the property. If we have the chance to return to Puerto Rico again, we will deffinitely stay again.

<Content>Great Hotel Suites Great hotel for families. Large, clean suites. This hotel was recently remodeled and it shows. Amazing free breakfast buffet (but crowded). The breakfast staff were extemely accomdating with special meal requests. The best free buffet (expect ihop food, not continental breakfast). Wonderful grounds, good location. Try Mi Casita restaurant (3 blocks from hotel) for good PR food. This hotel is definitely for families, expect lots of children everywhere.

<Content>super clean, but staff not helpful! Stayed with two friends at the end of July. Very clean with large rooms, nice pool (although we went to the beach). Breakfast okay, long line and wait for free cocktails at happy hour. Two blocks from beautiful beach (you can rent chairs $4 and umbrella $10 at the beach). $19 cab ride to old san juan. The only problem with this hotel was the front desk staff during the day and early evening. the woman who checked us in was VERY rude and later when we asked about activities (snorkeling kayaking etc...), they were not helpful. However, the overnight staff was fabulous. Very helpful with car rental and fixing an overcharge on the hotel bill for parking. Overall, I would stay here again as I loved the location to the beach.

<Content>A wonderful hotel We stayed for a week and enjoyed every minute. The breakfast is delicious and the complimentary drinks in the evening were great. The rooms were comfortable and the staff was very attentive and helpful. I am more of a resort on the beach person, but the walk from the hotel to the beach was not bad at all. It is located right next to the highway and the airport is very close, but you will not even notice. The pool area is gorgeous and the casino is small but it serves it purpose. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Mmmmm...Free Breakfast! Great Hotel! My friends and I stayed at the Embassy Suites from June 26th-30th. It was great!Upon our arrival the bellmen were great and greeted us as soon as our taxi pulled up to the door. Since we were unable to check in until 4pm, we asked the bellmen where to eat and they recommended a great restaurant in walking distance called Mi Casita. Great food but long wait during lunch rush. We then walked to the beach which is only 2 blocks away and not a bad walk at all since in Puerto Rico they stop for you when you go to cross the street. The Beach was clean and gorgeous. On Isla Verde Av. you can find some bars and meet up with the local people or hop on the bus to get a cheap tour of town. Also if you want you can take the bus right into Old San Juan for just .75 versus $19.50 one way per person taxi drive. Check in was fast and easy. Rooms were cleaned very efficently and had a fridge, microwave, sink for cleaning (aka kitchenette). Great room with King size bed and sofa bed. Hotel provided a great breakfast in the morning that was so filling it kept us full well into mid-day. The Pool was great well maintained and staffed. There is also a massage table at the pool and the prices are rather cheap. This was a great hotel and believe me I've stayed in my share of crap traps. Definitely would recommend.

<Content>Hotel nice but has issues We stayed here on a Sat night last June. It is about 1/2 mile and 10 minute taxi ride from the San Juan airport.First off I will mention that the hotel is nice and very clean. It has an attractive lobby and pool (you are near the airport but the noise of landing jets really isn't an issue). However this hotel is not without problems.The hotel does offer free internet access (as mentioned on their website) and there are three free interent kiosks near the check in desk. However, at least one of them was always out of order and the other two were constantly being used. My biggest complaint with the hotel is their handling of crowds. As mentioned we stayed there on a Saturday evening and the hotel was extremely crowded. The receptionist informed us that Saturdays are always busy because the pre-cruise crowd. (Apparently, a good number of customers stay in this hotel one night prior to their sailing date.)While the managers reception and cooked to order breakfast have always been some of the best things about the Embassy Suites we've stayed at - these are poorly handled at this one.First off the manager's reception. This hotel has a rule that there is a 2 drink maximum per bar visit. This is a problem if you have small children and your spouse has to stay with them while you wait in line for the drinks. The bar tender told me that I could come back for additional drinks, but the line was long and the wait was about 20 minutes. Also, the drinks are served in small palstic cups which don't tend to last very long. I think that, with additional bar tenders and a little more efficiency (larger cups??) the wait time could be drastically reduced.The same thing happened at breakfast. Very long lines (especailly if you wanted cooked to order foods). The wait was again about 20 minutes and finding a place to eat was a challenge.Finally, we asked for late check out on Sunday morning. Being an Hilton Honors member I've never been denied this request. However, this time I was. After having to prod for a reason why this request wasn't honored, the management finally told me that they had another large group checking in and needed to get all of the rooms ready. They did offer to store my luggage but we needed to do laundry so that wasn't much help.We tend to stay at Embassy Suites when we travel. While I might go back to this one, it was the most disappointing of all of the Embassy Suites properties that we've stayed at.

<Content>Best Hotel in San Juan by Far! Originally had planned to spend the week at the Hilton, however after 4 days of putting up with rude service and a room with no view, next to a construction site (building started at 4:30 am each day 鈥?Mon-Sat), we checked out and went to the Embassy Suites. What a difference. We were paying $295 for a Villa at the Hilton, plus they force you to pay a 10% 鈥渞esort fee鈥?and a 9% tax. The resort fee is for maid service, bellboy service and pool upkeep. Never heard of a hotel charging for these items. Embassy was only $175 per night and a much better value.

<Content>Awesome! We wound up at the Embassy Suites after we found out the hotel we were originally booked in was doing construction on their property. We had an absolutely delightful experience at Embassy Suites. The front desk personnel were extremely helpful (gave us directions everywhere and arranged our kayaking expedition for us) and were always pleasant. The pool was lovely. Towels are available poolside just in case you forget to bring your own. There are plenty of chairs, poolside bar and a waterfall that creates a peaceful scene. It was a little crowded on the weekend but during the week we had the pool to ourselves. Don't forget to try the hottub.The complimentary breakfast was great (eggs and pancakes made to order) with lots of choices (french toast, bacon, fruit, hot  cold cereal, muffins and bread galore).Rooms were very clean. Housekeeping even called us to make sure we didn't want our room cleaned because we had the do not disturb sign on the door. We were very pleased with the whole experience and plan on booking another trip before the years' end. I will always come back to this hotel.

<Content>Best place to stay in PR I was at the Embassy Suites from May 6th to the 8th, 2006.I have stayed at the Embassy several times on my way to St. Lucia, or before sailing on a cruise, the staff are friendly and accomodating. Outback Steakhouse ( which is located in the hotel) has great food and service , walked a short distance to the Intercontinental Hotel and had dinner at Ruth Chris Steak House, Shopping at Plaza Las Americas was great and just a short taxi ride from the Embassy. Would definetly stay here again on future visits.

<Content>Would Go Back Again!! Great Place to Stay Just returned from a 7 night, 8 day stay at the suites. From 4/21 to 4/28. Service was great after 1 initial problem of the room location, the staff is very helpful and accomodating, especially the head housekeeping staff, Bellhops and Liz at the front desk . The rooms are clean and well kept. The hotel staff is very helpful with any needs you have, even in making suggestions on what to do or where to go. The Embassy Grill located in the lobby of the hotel has excellent food and pricing was not bad either. Coming from NY I thought the meals was reasonably priced. Even room service was excellent. Many consider the rooms pricing, but with the inclusion of an amazing breakfast each morning and nightly managers reception including free drinks, it is well worth it.The lobby is beautiful with trees, greenery, water, the feeling of being outdoors. The pool area is clean and well maintained, pool towels available and even food service.Only complaint was the Outback restaruant located in the hotel a bit pricey for food that was nothing to rave about, especially when you ask for well done steak and it is totally pick, and then you are further insulted when someone comes out from the kitchen and tells you that is the color it is suppose to look, it really is cooked. You would think they would offer you at least a soda on the house. Service there was also very poor. Too many difference people servicing on table. Also long wait to get in and no reservations taken.Beach 1 1/2 blocks away, very clean, quite and beautiful. Would stay again.

<Content>Just back-Definitely planning to return Just returned from a 4 day stay and already planning to return. The hotel's common areas-the lobby, pool etc. are lovely and well appointed. The rooms, while nothing spectacular to look at, are spacious, clean and comfortable. As other reviews stated the breakfast and daily manager's reception were abundant. The staff was curteous and friendly. They responded to requests for things like a glass of ice and bandaids very propmtly. We had absolutely no problems with unpleasant smells or excessive noise. There was also a small casino that had a nightly bingo game with a $100 prize as well the usual table games and slots. Although the hotel has both a restaurant and an Outback on premises there are many places to eat in the immediate vacinity. There is a very wide range of restaurants from fast food to American casual dining chains, to more expensive restaurants as well as local cuisine (try both the Metropol and Mi Casita for native fare). The hotel is a short walk from the beach and the neighborhood seemed both safe and busy.  One day we took the local bus to Old San Juan and another day we rented a car for a trip to the rainforrest and Bacarardi Distillery. Speaking of car rentals-we bypassed the national chains and rented from a cheaper local place called Charlie's in walking distance of the hotel Worked out great-picked the car up on our last day and dropped it off that night. They took us to the airport in a van. Overall-great time-can't wait to go back.

<Content>OK hotel for short stay in San Juan We stayed at the Embassy Suites San Juan from March 29-31 on our way back from St. Kitts. From the San Juan Airport, it is about an $11 taxi ride to the hotel. We were greeted by a Hilton representative trying out the new Kiosk check-in, but we were unable to use this service as I was using points to pay for the stay. Check-in was quick and we were up to our room. Prior to my stay I went in and updated my Diamond profile on their website so that I would get bottled water, pretzels and a candy bar. None of this was in the room when we arrived. It was latter brought up by an attendant, but only the water, some mint Milanos, upgraded soaps, and a robe. Upon walking into the room we were greeted by a very strong smell (believe it was room 419). I thought it smelled like someone鈥檚 breather after drinking beer heavily. My wife thought it was nail polish remover. After about 15 minutes in this room we couldn鈥檛 stand it any longer. I went down to the front desk and complain. We were moved to another room on the seventh floor. This room still had a small smell, but not as bad. Also, the water, pretzels, and candy bar were already in the room, but I assume they were meant for another HHonors member.The rooms were well appointed and typical of an Embassy Suites. The front room had a fridge and microwave. Embassy has just upgraded to their new Serta mattresses, which are much better than some of the old hard ones that I have slept on at some of their other hotels (Chicago and Houston). Both the front room and bedroom had their own TVs.Both rooms we had were off in the corners. We never had any problems with noise in this hotel. I was particular amazed that our second room seemed to be 100 yards from the end of the runway at the airport, but we were never bother by noise from the planes or cars that ran on the highway near the hotel.The pool was exactly like described in previous post. The back of the pool is the embankment to a highway. You would hardly notice it down there. Plus, I ran into the same problem with the hot tub. We couldn鈥檛 find any switch to turn it on. I asked the lady who was handing out towels and she told me that it wasn鈥檛 broke but all it did was to put out hot water. No jets like a regular hot tub. I felt lied to by this explanation. However, there was also a bar, a kids pool, and large pool in the area. There was a really nice waterfall into the pool too.We enjoyed both the evening reception and breakfast. The evening reception had the custom assortment of beverages. They even had machines for those icy type alcoholic drinks such as margaritas and daiquiris. I especially enjoyed the Carlsberg on tap. Thought this was unusual for Puerto Rico, but good beer. They even had Nachos/Salsa, popcorn and a snack Mix too. Breakfast was pretty typical for an Embassy Suites. I had my typical ham and cheese omelet. We really appreciated the assortment of fresh fruit too.Took the advice of a past post and rented from Charlie Cars. Was less than a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. We were able to drive out to El Yunque in about 45 minutes. Driving in San Juan was much like we are used to here in Chicago, if not better. Just watch out for rush hour as backups are common. Renting a car allowed us to easily get in and out of Old San Juan without the $20 each way fare.We stayed away from the Casino. I felt I had better ways of spending my money on vacation. It is loud if you are in the atrium. You can hear the sound of the machines and singer billowing out into the atrium. The place was packed on the Thursday night before we left.The one thing I really liked about this hotel was in the entrance there was a small business area. They had about three computer setup on a Kiosk so you can surf the internet. This allowed us to check our email for any notices from the airline before leaving for home.One last note as a warning. The walk from the hotel to beach is not a short one. You have to walk one large city block north past the Holiday Inn and another building to get to Isla Verde. Once across Isla Verde you have to walk down an alley between two large resorts to get to beach. You certainly can鈥檛 hear the waves from the Embassy.

<Content>A fantastic hotel! Our family returned from our stay in Puerto Rico last week. We would highly recommend this particular hotel. The staff was friendly and very accommodating to all our needs. The rooms were spotless with extremely comfortable beds,pillows and linens. The bathrooms have large, plush towels. You don't have to fight with the shower fixtures to get more than a trickle of hot water...the shower is like being at home. The atrium is lovely...a very tropical feel. We were there with a lot of family members and there was plenty of open areas to get together and meet comfortably. The pool area was beautiful and refreshing with lots of new lounge chairs and tables. There was always enough chairs for our group (and we had a lot of people in our group)...you never had to try and find available lounges. Breakfast was terrific...always hot and fresh and delicious. The manager's reception was always fun. They have a nice selection of mixed tropical drinks and decent snacks. Music is playing most of the time and it gives the feeling of being in a very happy and fun place. If there was one drawback, I would have to say it was the proximity of the airport to the hotel while you are sitting by the pool. That's the only time we noticed the planes and you will definitely notice the planes. Other than that, this hotel is the best and we would highly recommend staying here.

<Content>Great Stay with kids We stayed at the Embassy Suites in Isla Verde in early February. Since we were traveling with our 2 young kids we loved having the extra room - the kids liked sleeping on the sofa bed. The hotel is a couple short blocks from the beach - a 5 minute walk. We considered the Intercontential hotel, but having a suite was more important than being beachfront. We loved the pool, complimentary breakfast  managers reception nightly. We were on hte 7th floor  could barely hear the live entertainment on the weekend. Go to Pueblo grocery around the corner if you need things. Also, don't miss Mi Casita restaurant. We had a wonderful time!

<Content>Don't do it! This is the third stay that I have had in a three month period. Although the rooms are adequate, and the breakfast is good, beware the downfalls. The casino operates illegally-rules are not posted and vary on a dealer to dealer basis. Take a close look and you will note ALL of the casino tactics that strengthen the hotel's advantage. If that doesn't convince you, take a look at the cashier's line (or lack thereof).This is not the norm at other casinos in San Juan. For Honors members, forget the daily papers, bottled water and other snacks that are the norm at other Embassy Suites.There is no elevator in the parking garage so there is a very good chance that you'll be carrying your luggage up and down 5 flights of stairs. There's an daily internet charge and a daily parking charge.I was pleased with this hotel on my first stay here, but I have thus learned that the Puerto Rico Marriott chain supercedes the Hilton chain in all categories.

<Content>Really nice hotel! This hotel had very nice,big, clean suites. it has its own kitchen and its own room and family room (with a pullout bed). It was very nice and the beach was beautiful too. There are plenty of fish to see (big ones and small ones). The beach is very long and its just beautiful. Its a great get away!

<Content>Excellent Value for Money Located one and half block from the Isla Verde beach (very clean) and next to a Pueblo grocery store. Excellent value for money. We got a suite on the seventh floor consisting of a living-dining area, small microwave, coffee maker, fridge and wet bar as well as a great bedroom with a very comfortable king sized bed. The hotel has a lovely atrium and a superb pool with a waterfall and hot tub. They provide a free hot breakfast buffet including cooked to order eggs, omelettes, or pancakes. In the afternoon they have a two-hour manager鈥檚 party with a free open bar. There is also an Outback Steakhouse on the premises. The hotel has a small gym and a coin laundry. The only thing that needs improvement is the room safe. It operates with a key that is inconvenient and requires an $85 deposit. Overall, it is an excellent hotel if you do not absolutely need to be inches from the beach.

<Content>Good hotel - here are some tips for your stay We stayed at the Embassy Suites San Juan on Jan 12 to Jan 16th. Overall we really enjoyed our stay, and felt we got more than our money's worth. Here are some of the tips I have for anyone considering a stay here:Location in regards to the beach: The location is the tradeoff for the lower price you pay. It is two block to the beach. This is not bad, even for our family traveling with two younger children. We got quite good at packing our bags full so that we didn't forget anything and have to trek back to the hotel. They do rent lounge chairs and umbrellas at the Isla Verde/Carolina beach - $4 for chairs and $11 for umbrellas if I recall correctly. Just make sure to bring towels down to the beach with you (we snagged towels from the pool area and then returned them at the end of the day)The pool: We never heard any traffic from the road that ran behind the pool. We also sat out at the pool each night with our drinks and the traffic was never loud, nor did we have any trouble with the airport noise. Only negative was that the hot tub was broken while we were there. It was hot but no bubbles.Rooms: The key here is to know that some of the rooms are renovated and some are not. Obviously the renovated rooms are better. While we were there the hotel had finished the 7th and 8th floors and were working on the 6th. My suggestion is to ask for the highest floor possible. Also, we never had any problem with airplane noise in our room, nor with the music from the lobby. Again, location may be the key. We were on the 8th floor facing downtown/Old San Juan (overlooking the parking ramp).Breakfast and Manager's Reception: To us, these were the two best reasons to stay at this hotel. The breafast is excellent. They had make to order eggs (fried, omelets, etc), sausage, bacon, fruit, cereal, juice - you name it - and it is free. However, the best deal is the Manager's Reception each evening. From 5:30 to 7:30 they offer free drinks and snacks. You can get two drinks per person at a time, and you can return as many times as you want. The snacks were tortilla chips and salsa, pretzels, and popcorn. I especially enjoyed the strawberry daiquiris! Restaurants: We tried the Outback Steakhouse in the hotel and it was as good as any Outback we've ever eaten at. Yes, the line can be long but if you tell the hostess you are staying at the hotel they usually seat you immediately. We ate there on both a Thursay and a Saturday night and did not wait either night to be seated. Make sure to bring in one of your free drink from the Managers Reception (they always let us do this) and save the money on drinks. The location of the hotel is great as far as local restaurants go. There is just about every fast food chain within two blocks (KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Wendys) We also tried Metropol and had the best dinner of our stay, and it only average $15 per person without drinks. There is also a large Peublo grocery store one block away that has all the necessities. Take advantage and stock the room fridge with soda and water - prices at the grocery store seemed to be about the same as mainland groceries.Taxis: We did not rent a car and instead took taxis everywhere. It was about $12 each way for 4 of us to get to and from the airport. It was about $22 each way to get to get to Old San Juan. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would stay here again. We felt that for the price it was an excellent deal.

<Content>Decent Hotel Stay My family stayed here on Jan 25, 2005. It's funny reading the previous reviews because we had a very different impression of the hotel. I found it to be clean, comfortable and quiet. Yes, there is maintenance being done, but the workers are very careful and warn you if you are approaching a freshly painted area. The beds are fine, the sofa bed is a bit uncomfortable and for one night was acceptable. The breakfasts were fine. Great coffee. The nightly manager party was fun with fruity drinks, and standard junk food of chips, pretzels, party mix and popcorn.The pool was lovely, I can't figure out what people were complaining about. I didn't see any missing tiles and I made a point of searching it out. One traveler said the pool area looked like a hurricane hit it. I can't figure that out either it was simply beautiful. Yes, you can hear the planes either taking off or landing depending on the direction of the wind. After awhile you get use to the sound and you don't notice the aircraft noise. The sounds of the kids screaming and yelling drown the noise out. I don't mind the sound of the kids, I simply put on my headphones and listen to music. It's not as bad as previous reviews write and I consider myself very sensitive to unnecessary noise. The beach is exactly 3 blocks away. One long block and two short. If you have very young kids, this might pose a logistical problem because you need to carry your towels/junk and hold onto kids. I have kids 14, 12,9, so it was no problem. Yes,one of the streets is a highly trafficed street and there is no traffic light. But if you enter the crosswalk the cars did stop for us. No, I wouldn't let the kids do this by themselves. I just don't trust them or the drivers. We walked to the beach and went banana boating which can be found in front of the ESJ hotel. At the same time other kids are on the beach and my kids made instant friends. This worked out well for us. The beach is public and you can rent the chairs for $3-$4 per chair depending where you stop. In front of the ESJ hotel the chairs are $3. This place is good for a short stay and the hotel is designed for business travelers. As we saw mostly flight attendants and business people. If you like the hustle and bustle of San Juan this a decent place. If you are looking for a peaceful surrounding and limited night life you should stay a resort such as the Hyatt in Dorado.The hotel staff is very accomodating and helpful.

<Content>Under construction! Wait until done! or try Hampton Inn We thought the hotel looked pretty (atrium courtyard and pool areas)and the happy hour was fun, breakfast good.However, when we arrived they were doing some kind of work on the tile in the lobby, with jack-hammering noise that was awful. It started up again the next morning early too.We'd reserved a room with a king sized bed, non-smoking, and were told that's what we were being sent to, but after tipping the bell-boy, we discovered we'd been deposited at a room with 2 double beds instead. We called and were told we could come back in an hour and a half  a room would be ready. When we got back they had us in a room that had just had new carpet installed that day, and boy did it stink! I felt like I could hardly breathe, and had to prop our door open. Luckily, the next day the smell had pretty much gone. But there were no windows you could open to remove the smell. And to make matters worse, the thermostat was not adjustable. It was 65 degrees in the room when we got there (a shock after the delightful 78-81 degrees approximently of outdoors), and when we tried to jack it up to 76 degrees (by lowering the air conditioning) it would not budge above 71 degrees. I had to wear a sweater in my room! They sent an engineer but he couldn't fix it. Our phones didn't work either, but he was able to fix one of the two. It was nice having a safe in the room, but you have to go downstairs  ask for a key, rather than just assigning a combination like some.... And if you forget to turn it in when you check out, it costs you $85. Has a small refrigerator, coffee maker  microwave. Only coffee cups though, no other dishes. The noise at night from the band is loud, even as late as midnight or after. The band did play nice music though, but it would be hard with people trying to get their kids to sleep! The sofabed was the lumpiest  most uncomfortable one my son has ever slept on, and he has slept on many. Our bed was fine, but the spread smelled (or was it the drapes nearby) like stale cigarettes, even though it was a nonsmoking room. It was a nice beach about 2 blocks away, but not good for snorkeling or sailing: too rough of water. The Holiday Inn next door rented us a (Dollar Rent a Car) car for $38/day plus gas, but is only open something like 8 or 9 to 5pm,  no one else can give you any info. The map they give you is painfully inadequate for finding your way to El Yunque rain forest. Many turnoffs say an intersection is coming up, but when you get there, it's labeled with a different highway number. Or no number. And there are lots of highways that you won't even find on the map! It's really a challenge. Took over an hour to get to  from the rainforest due to minor getting lost episodes. It's worth going to however. The water at the falls was supposedly cold but people were still going in. Holiday Inn has a nice restaurant or two next door,and no waiting. The Outback in the Embassy Suites was good, but more money and a longer wait by far. There was a pool bar, but no one seemed to man it so it wasn't used. We had to leave to catch a plane at 5:30am but were able to grab a piece of fruit and yoghurts to take with us for breakfast despite them not yet being open for breakfast. Had muffins or something available too. Bring a nightlight because the bathroom is dark at night. I'd reserved a room for $305 per night online, but at checkout they were charging me $359, so I had to try to go online in the business center to print out my confirmation to prove my rate. They ended up honoring the $305. I think next time I might try the Hampton Inn  Suites a couple of blocks further down the street for only $215 or $220 instead for the quieter atmosphere. I saw the outside  it looked better than its pictures, but didn't get to see the pool or anything. It had a buffet breakfast included (Embassy had same but with cook-to-order so you could order pancakes or eggs over easy)and Hampton didn't have a happy hour I don't think. But a lot cheaper, and people seem to review it well. Embassy's casino seemed a bit dreary. When you walk into the Embassy you are hit with cold air and a stale cigaretty smell. Ugh. Holiday Inn is even colder to walk into! Incredibly cold!!! The bus for 75 cents each requires quarters, not a $1 bill and 2 quarters for 2 people, to get to Old Town San Juan. It's the last stop, by the way, at the bus terminal, where you get off. El Morro is very cool to explore, and the city itself is clean and interesting architecture. The free trolleys loop around. You press a yellow bar between the windows to signal you want to stop. No where to rent small sailboats in the whole area!

<Content>great location, hotel needs renovation Just returned from a trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and stayed at this hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel for location (one block walk to the gorgeous beach!) The morning breakfast was very very nice and the pool area looks tropical and inviting. The only thing I can say is that the hotel is showing its age. The pool area needs replacing of tiles and cement, and it would be lovely. The entrances to the rooms also show wear and tear, but still is kept nice and clean. Don't expect to win one thing in the casino!

<Content>Friendly and helpful staff We stayed here one night last Jan 3rd. The service was great, staff was friendly and very helpful. Food at the Grill restaurant was very good. There is an Outback restaurant on site,and also a casino. The room was clean and comfortable, though the carpet had few stains. Not at the beach, but not far either, like a 15 minutes walk. We could stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel This is my 4th stay at this hotel since I travel to San Juan for business and I have enjoyed all of my visits. The staff is very courteous, clean rooms, great drinks, decent food, live entertainment (which is really great), close to the beach (about 2 1/2 blocks), and close to many restaurants. It's family friendly also. I am very picky about where I stay and for me to keep coming back it has be pretty good. They also have a business center (2 pcs, 2 printers, and a copy machine) that is for guest use and it is free. Wireless internet access is available for a charge of 9.95 a night.

<Content>Good Hotel, But Not Near The Beach My son and I stayed at the Embassy Suites in mid December. We arrived very early in the morning and our room was waiting for us which we were thankful for since we had a long flight. The Embassy Suites is a great hotel for families, since they offer a free buffet breakfast. The rooms are nice and large, and our room was clean. TV worked ....all was ok The hotel does have a small casino for those who like to gamble. There is also a happy hour, and a nice resturant on site..Outback Steak House??I think??.There are two computers for e-mail or internet service. At this hotel, I think the only draw back for me is that the hotel is a little to far from the ocean. You have to walk several blocks to get to the main street which is Isa Verde. I think parking at the hotel is $16.00 per day. When we were there, we had to walk over to the InterContinental Hotel which is a beautiful hotel on the beach to pick up a tour. By the way there is a nice Holiday Inn in this same area.

<Content>Great Pre-Cruise Hotel My husband and I, as well as our friends, stayed at this hotel before our Princess cruise. We found this hotel to be very comfortable and the staff was very friendly and accomodating. The buffet breakfast and complimentary drinks in the evening were an added bonus. The hotel was a 2 block walk to the beach, which was beautiful and very safe to walk along. Taxis were always available to take to Old San Juan. The pool was great and very clean. The bed was one of the best we have ever slept on at a hotel. We would highly recommend this hotel, and we will definately stay here again.

<Content>nice hotel, conveniant location The hotel has a small casino with live music on the weekends. They have free daily breakfast and cocktail hour which includes chip and salsa. The hotel is 2 blocks from the A5 public bus stop which will take you to old san jaun for 75 cents. It is also 2 blocks away from Pueblo's grocery store, the beach and fast-food chains. The room at the hotel provide refrig and microwave, and the bathroom was definately designed for a woman. The service was okay- some really friendly, some not so much. The excersise room was in decent and well maintained (and free). Over-all I was pretty happy with the hotel and would recommend it.

<Content>I'd stay there again A friend and I stayed here October 27 to 29. It is an excellent hotel. The atrium is very impressive. The elevator design is geometric/industrial rather than opulent, but they are good elevators with glass wall views as one ascends to the rooms. The suites had aging, slightly dowdy furnishings, but the rooms were quite comfortable and spacious. The shower-tub could use a clothesline, but that is a minor quibble. The happy hour is a pleasant plus with very good drinks. The breakfast is also very good. My friend, Dick, enjoyed the casino and found the rules for blackjack highly favorable in part because of the ability to surrender. He was up $100+ after two nights.The wonderful pool is by a freeway, but it is largely screened by dense palms and the waterfall provides white noise to hush the traffic.The staff bends over backward to provide top-notch service. The fitness center is small, but adequate and a nice retreat.It is a straight two block walk to the magnificent Isla Verde beach. It is a one block walk to reasonable shops and a variety of restaurants. The Carolina/Isla Verde area is a very nice area.We rented a car at the adjacent Holiday Inn (Less than $38 total plus $14.75 for gas). I found the other drivers to be laid back and cortez/simpatico. We drove all over the city and old San Juan. Dick could not walk much. We drove to El Yunque and as far up as we could go by car and thoroughly enjoyed the trip.It is a very short taxi ride to the airport.

<Content>Eh, ok We were three couples who were only staying 1 night in San Juan as we flew to St. Lucia the next day. I had reserved a 2 bedroom suite for our purposes and had expected 1 whole suite. Instead we had two adjacent rooms with 3 beds. Upon arrival to our rooms, one of the two had not been cleaned and the shower curtain was sitting out on the bed.The beds were extremely uncomfortable we thought. The casino was very small and did not have many dealers so it was hard to get on a table even though there weren't even many people there.The free breakfast in the morning was good. We did enjoy it quite a bit.They were in the process of remodeling (painting I think) so the hotel did look a little old and rundown but will improve I suspect.In my opinion, it wasn't worth the near $400 we paid for the room(s). I thought it would be nicer than this.

<Content>Very Good My Family and I stayed at Embassy hotel San Juan from July 25th till Aug 4th of this year and we liked it very much.My teeneage daughter could chat with her friends everyday and my 4 year old could play games at the computer and walk around safely. We enjoyed the pool and the 2 hour free drinks every day. From the location we could go everywhere. The rooms are good,but perhaps with a little change it can be better.My husband liked the bar and the music very muchThe breakfast was very good and very convenient because you can take everything you want to your room. What we liked very much was the employees at the frontdesk. They did everything we asked them and they made calls for us, very nice.Next time we visit Puerto Rico we want to tay at Embassy again.

<Content>Breakfast  My family and I stayed at the Embassy on August 25-27 before we left on our cruise. There were positives and negatives. I'll start with the positives: FREE DRINKS! Need I say more? The Manager's Evening Reception is held every night in the main lobby. Each guest is entitled to free drinks and snacks (nachos and popcorn). Also, breakfast is complimentary and we were able to bring it up to our room. All you can eat  drink! The location of the hotel is very close to the airport. We paid $16.00 for a taxi to take all five of us to the hotel. The beach is about two blocks away and there are many restaurants nearby. You can find both American and traditional Puerto Rican food within walking distance. Isla Verde is known as a tourist spot and there are many hotels very close by. (I would recommend the Wyndam. Very nice and classy.) The Embassy has a lively atmostphere and has a salsa band that plays into the late evening. The casino is much smaller than I anticipated though. There is an Outback Steakhouse located inside the lobby area. We noticed many many locals dining there. The pool area is excellent and relaxing. There were, however, a couple of negatives about the Embassy. The hotel has an open atrium where the rooms are located on the sides. Because of the lay out, you could hear the band playing all night long. Also, the rooms had a musty smell to them. Other than that, the value was worth the price. If you want to stay in Old San Juan (about 20 minutes away) definitely stay at El Convento. La Fortaleza is within walking distance. Definitely visit El Yunke, but be prepared to walk and get some exercise. Go to Vieques or Culebra if you have the opportunity. I loved Puerto Rico  Reggaeton!

<Content>Overall satisfied I stayed at the Embassy suites with my family. I was overall satisfied with our stay there. The staff was very helpful and the room was kept clean. Initially I was put off by the fact that our room had lots of ANTS. The staff was quick to move us to a different suite when we complained about the infestation. So I wasn't a happy camper when we first arrived. I also couldn't believe that a suite which would sleep 4 of us only had 4 drawers and a tiny closet. The drawers were small. But you know what? by the evening of our first day there we forgot all about that other stuff and enjoyed the managers reception-which is free drinks and snacks. The hotel is also conveniently located off the main road which has many souvenir shops,restaurants and a small supermarket. The best place to get puerto rican food inexpensively is La Casita which is in the shopping center near the hotel. I've also stayed at the Intercontinental hotel in the past. These two hotels are 2 that I would recomment. The advantage the Intercontinental Hotel has is that it is right on the beach. The beach is about 2 blocks from the Embassy Suites and easily accessible off the main road . Again overall I was a satisfied guest.

<Content>Loved it I went to PR for the first time this summer and the Embassy Suites was a great selection. I traveled with seven other females and we all loved the hotel. The staff was great, the free breakfast (made to order) was a great addition to the manager's reception (free drinks) every evening from 5-7pm. The hotel is located very close (1 to 2 blocks) to all hotels/ clubs, and the beach is about 2 blocks away. Embassy suites also has a beautiful pool and jacuzzi area, not to mention some handsome pool men:) I plan to return next year with my girls again.

<Content>It's a place for everyone, singles, families! My friends and I stayed at the Embassy from Aug 12th-17th. This hotel is great for the price! Complimentary breakfast and drinks in the evening daily. What more can you ask for? :) It's clean and the pool is well maintained. The only problem we had, we felt that a few of the employees at the front desk can be a little short and should be more pleasant. However, how much time do you spend at the front desk. I would recommend this place to friends.

<Content>Wow! Loved Embassy Suites We just came back from Puerto Rico. We stayed at this hotel and we were really impressed with everything from the service to the cleanliness. The morning breakfast was good and the evening manager's reception was just as good. We ate at their restaurant and the food was really, really good. Playing at the casino was fun. The lounge was always lively. The beach is really close by. Overall our stay was a really, really pleasant one.

<Content>o.k. stay As usual before I book a hotel I visit Trip advisor and meticulously read all the reviews. Unfortunately my visit wasn't anywhere near perfect. I traveled over the memorial day weekend with my husband and 3 small children. We booked our reservations ahead of time and requested a 2 bedroom suite. The hotel was sold out so when we arrived at 3:45 for a 4:00pm check in we were dissapointed that they did not have the 2 double bed suite we selected. Instead they told us they would put us in a king with a pull out sofa. The woman at the desk who claimed to be the manager offered me nothing else except the possibility of getting a roll away bed. After threatening to contact the corporate office she finally offered to reduce my rate by 15%. Secondly there were two nights where they ran out of clean room towels and offered to send up beach towels. Then they ran out of beach towels. The food ant the outback was ok but very very slow. The pool was beautiful and my kids loved it. The beach was about 3 blocks away you had to cross a very busy street. The hotel is a stones throw away from a major freeway and 10 minutes from the airport neither one was much of a problem except for the occasional noise by the pool. The free breakfast was below average the first day and o.k the second day. The managers reception did offer plenty of drinks alcoholic and non. But the snacks were the same every day. Trail mix, popcorn and chips/salsa. The band was very loud and echoed througout the atrium for as late as 2am atleast. The casino is one room with a hand full of slots and maybe some tables in the back (I didn't have the interest). The front desk did their jobs but were not overly accomodating. Food trays were left in the hall and the maids missed cleaning our room one day. The hotel was very clean the rooms were o.k. Not realy a kitchenette just a microwave and fridge. The lobby was very clean. But I consistently found cups and plates that were supposedly clean (old food and hair on them). Maybe I picked a bad weekend but I will not be anxious to return.

<Content>Embassy Suites in San Juan is the greatest! We stayed at the Embassy Suites for two nights and our time there was too, too short! We would have stayed a week, but our schedule did not permit it. We loved the suite on the second floor which was so comfortable and clean. The room was immaculate and everything about the Embassy was to our satisfaction. The pool area was so clean and of course, the managers reception each evening was really nice. The breakfast was the highlight of the day everything you can imagine was cooked to perfection. The chef on duty and workers were so pleasant and helpful. We would definitely stay there again. Our first night, we went to dinner to the Mi Casita restaurant which is one block away and afterwards we walked to the Isla Verde beach nearby. The puerto rican food was cooked to perfection and the beach was just gorgeous. the next night it rained so we stayed in and dined at the Outback Steakhouse which was right inside the Embassy Suites. That was wonderful too!I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Juan!

<Content>Convenient place to stay We stayed here one night pre-cruise. We had 3 rooms for a family of 12. We were able to relax the night before the cruise, and enjoyed a cook-to-order breakfast before we caught a taxi to the cruise pier. Hotel was convenient to both the airport and pier. There is also a local supermarket nearby (within walking distance). Although we didn't get to enjoy all the amenities of the hotel due to time constraints, we did enjoy our short stay there. I would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Great Place to Stay I was in Puerto Rico from April 20 to April 24th. I booked this trip last minute so my choices in hotels were a little limited but I'm happy I stayed at Embassy Suites. The major perk of this hotel are the rooms. You can't beat the luxury of a full two room suite. The second room comes with a work/dining table, sofa and another tv with NYC channels and a kitchen area with microwave, sink and refridgerator. This hotel also has a free breakfast buffet with made to order pancakes and eggs. There is also a happy hr with live music from 5:30 - 7:30. very nice! there were light snacks and unlimited drinks for kids and adults. Theyalso have a small business center with 3 internet ready computers. This is not a beachfront hotel so if you're really set on staying right on the beach and walking back and forth to your hotel, this might not be for you. I went to the beach but it was not the main part of my trip. It's an easy 5 minute (2 blocks) walk. Embassy's pool area is very big and they have shady spots too. I loved their hot tub which is a little secluded from the main pool area. While you're out, you might hear a plane or two, since the airport is near. It is not deafening, so don't let that keep you from staying here. Once you're in the room, you don't hear it at all. We rented a car from holiday inn (next door and on the way to the beach) for about $49 and we got a mustang convertable since they didn't have any other cars left. renting a car is a good idea bc you can drive along the coast and see other areas. Be careful when you're on the road. PR drivers are a little rough.After we gave the car back, we took advantage of the bus (25cents) and took the A5 to Old San Juan. The fort is a must see bc the views are just fantastic. The buses run until 9pm.Embassy's casino is nice but a little small. You can use 5cents here so I was a fan. and i think players get free drinks. There is also live music playing from 6ish on. It wasn't so loud that I oculd hear it in my room. I stayed on the 7th floor. Also shopping is tax free. They have a pretty American mall. We hit this up on a rainy day. My only gripe about the hotel is that the concierge wasnt always there during her hours and it's hard to find a parking space in the garage bc so many people come for the casino and outback steakhouse (which is inside the hotel).

<Content>Great place to stay I just got back from five days at the Embassy Suites in San Juan. Everything about the hotel is excellent. The rooms were spacious and clean and perfect for four girls. We loved the daily breakfast and happy hour each night. The selection at both was amazing. The drinks they make during the cocktail reception are strong. You can get two at a time and go back as many times as you want. I'm hooked on Pina Coladas. The pool area is fantastic. It's a large, lagoon-style pool with palm trees and flowering bushes. The pool and hot tub were both extremely clean. There are lounge chairs at the pool that come with a canopy for those that want to get some shade. The location is perfect. It is only a short 10-minute walk to the beach. The beach is wide and you can rent chairs for $3 or umbrellas for $10. The water was crystal clear and the surf was calm. We took a 15-minute walk to a nearby restaurant, Metropol. The food is a mix of Puerto Rican and Cuban. We really enjoyed the local flavor. There is also a Pueblo supermarket nearby. Be sure to stop there and buy coffee to take home. It was much cheaper than at the airport or other tourist shops.To get to other areas within San Juan, you can walk towards the beach and pick up the bus. We took several rides to Old San Juan for just a quarter each. Taxis are faster but you can't beat the price of the bus. You can take the A5 bus into Old San Juan and then catch the ferry to Catano to visit the Bacardi Rum Factory. I would recommend it highly. The ferry is only 50 cents each way and the factory is free with two free drinks included. Don't miss El Morro, the 500-year-old fort at the tip of Old San Juan. The views are stunning.Also, don't miss the rainforest, El Yunque. We rented a car at the Holiday Inn next to the Embassy Suites for $30 per day. We drove to the rainforest, hiked to La Mina falls, and swam underneath it. It was a super hike and the water was refreshing.Another must see is the bioluminescent bay at Fajardo. It's one of the most amazing things you'll ever see. We went on a kayaking tour with Eco Action Tours. I had never kayaked before and it was so much fun. They take you out in 2 and 3-person kayaks through a mangrove swamp and into a lagoon filled with the glowing plankton. The highlight of the trip is getting into the lagoon and swimming. The faster you swim, the brighter the plankton glows. I've never seen anything like it. Be sure you try it, you won't regret it. It costs $40 for a two-hour adventure. Totally worth it. Since El Yunque and the Biobay at Fajardo are so close to each other, you can rent a car and see both in one day. This was much cheaper than the excursions offered by the hotel and you could customize what you wanted to see and where to stop.Have a great time in Puerto Rico, there's a lot to do.

<Content>Good place to stay We (a family of five) stayed from March 19 to March 27. The hotel was fine. The airport was close but you can't hear the planes from the rooms. The pool was lovely. There is a nice exercise room and having the laundry was a bonus when traveling with a family. The teenagers loved the breakfast buffet. The rooms have a fridge and microwave so you can buy some lunch items. The only negative was the band that played late on the weekend nights. The music was good but loud. In addition to the supermarket in the little strip mall near the beach, there is a bigger one to the west of the hotel - take the road to the right of the hotel exit. You have to walk as the road is a one way ramp off the freeway.The location of the hotel is good - easy access to freeways to go to the rainforest and caves. Having a suite was a real bonus for a family - nice to be able to close the door to the bedroom if some want to sleep earlier or later. The neighborhood was safe. I felt fine letting my teenagers walk to the beach or the shops during the day.

<Content>Excellent Value Stayed from 3/29 to 4/1The hotel is in excellent condition (like new). The lobby is spacious and nicely landscaped. The level of cleanliness everywhere in the hotel was remarkable. Service was extremely efficient, very courteous and helpful. Always a smiling face.The included free breakfast was very good, but I strongly suggest ordering an omelet (very good) rather than taking the eggs from the steam table (well, they _are_ eggs on a steam table). The made-to-order pancakes were also very good. There was also this white gooey stuff that my wife thought was grits and I though was cream of wheat. Most of the local guests were scooping it up like crazy, so I broke down and tried it. It was really excellent, but I still didn't know what it was. I finally asked, and it turned out to be oatmeal, but I certainly didn't recognize it as such. It was very good, but it was loaded with sugar (which, I suppose, is why it was so good). Avoid if dieting. There is also an assortment of cold cereal, freesh fruit and the usual bagels, muffins, toast, etc. Several juices, yogurt, American and Puerto rican coffee, etc. The Puerto Rican coffee in the rooms is better than that served at breakfast.The included nightly manager's cocktail reception si also excellent. Pretty much anything you want in the way of drinks. Alcohol was not scarce in them! Contrary to other reports, there are no hot hors d'ouerves (at least not during the week), but they are available for a modest price. Corn chips witn salsa and cheese, Chex mix, and pop corn are included. Have drinks served in plastic if you want to drink by the pool, which is also very nicely landscaped.The room was in excellent condition and smelled fresh. No great views from any side, near as I could tell. Bands play till 9 or 10, or sometimes 11 just outside the casino, so if you go to bed early, ask for a room as far from the casino as possible. The bands ranged from good to excellent. A salsa band played on Thursday night, and we would have gladly paid to hear them.Computer access- in room data lines, in-room TV internet surfing at $9.95/day, or there are three free internet-connected, printer equipped computers in the lobby. They were usually occupied (by kids) till about 10 PM, but if you really need to use one it isn't a problem.Location is convenient, and though across from the airport, there was almost no noise. There is a small strip mall a block away with fast food, a local restaurant, a bakery/coffee shop, and small supermarket. Charlie's Car rental (another excellent value) is less than two blocks away, as is the beach.Security is pretty good- a room card is needed to use the elevators. In general, security seems to be an issue in Puerto Rico. Everywhere we went (not just the cities), there were bars on windows, and walls with barbed/razor wire. Mall parking lots have guard towers (not a bad idea, actually). Another thing to watch out for- parking in Old San Juan is non-existent. After finding the municipal lot filled, I found what I thought was a legal spot near El Morro. It was one of two available spots on the street, no yellow curb, no tickets on other vehices, no signs in sight. You guessed it. Turns out there _was_ a sign, but it was on the wall of a building, not on a sign post, and only at one end of the street. $25 lesson learned. Another warning -fast food isn't. Burger King, 12:30 PM, lunch crowd. One employee taking orders and serving them (at a snail's pace), one employee cooking, one working the drive-thru, and two eating lunch. Took us 45 minutes.Anyway, back to the hotel- the only negative comments I can make about the hotel is that the shower head did not provide the amount water pressure the I like- but almost no hotel does, so that really doesn't count. The other one is that they did not have hair rinse conditioner for my wife, which is strange, as that always seems to be one of those little botlles in the bathroom. Oh well...We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>The Hotel was great. I stayed at the Hotel from 3/18 - 3/25 and loved it, the service was great the pool area was beautiful and the Breakfast and happy hour were a plus and were awesome, my family and I had a wonderful time and would go and stay their again. The walk to the ocean/beach was less then 5 minutes and the Isla Verde Beach had everything you need to enjoy your day, they had every water activity you wanted and it was great, you can even bring drinks to the beach, and a small mall right before you get to the beach provided that, and some small resturants, Mi Casita had great service and fast as we were on a time frame and they met it, the Mofogo was great, and the prices were resonable. All in all the Hotel is in a great area and it worth staying at.

<Content>Nice stay Just stayed our precruise night at ES. Service was excellent. They have ES amenities of manager's reception 5-7 and complimentary made to order breakfast. The pool lagoon is very nice..several pools, whirlpools,waterfall, etc. Outback Steakhouse is in hotel. The have a small casino and live latin combo with dancefloor. Very festive.The beach is just a short walk away. This hotel worked out well for our short stay.

<Content>Just Like the U.S. This facility is the equal, if not better, than any other Embassy Suite in the U.S. If you like Embassy Suites and all they offer, you will not be disappointed here. Great facility and extraordinary staff. Near the airport and a short walk to a beautiful beach. With a car you can get anywhere and see anything with ease. With the breakfast and happy hour you can avoid the need to do any food shopping although a supermarket is a five minute walk away. My wife belongs to Curves and there is one one top of the supermarket. She said it was identical in every detail, down to the bathroom sink, to the one she goes to.

<Content>Great February Vacation My family and I stayed at this hotel last week during school vaction. I had telephoned the manager, whose name is Julian directly (whereby securing a better rate than one I was quoted by reservations at the 800 Hilton number) and he assured me I would be given a nice room. Our suite was #817 which was the top floor and faced the pool. It was very clean and spacious and lacked nothing. The inclusive full breakfast buffet every morning and the 2 hour manager's cocktail reception every evening was great and also lacked nothing. My kids, ages 8 and 9 virtually lived in their beautiful lagoon style pool. The only thing I thought was not that great was their casino. It was super small and had limited slots and two black jack tables. The dealer deals from a deck that is in a black box, so you really can't see whether it's a new shuffle or down to the last cards. THough the minimum bet was only $5, I blew $300 without hardly ever winning (the same goes for the folks playing around me) Any time I did win seemed to bring displeasure from the dealer. The El Yunque forest was very nice, about 1/2 hour drive from hotel. The Canua Caves were amazing, but I would not go again. IT takes 1 1/2 hours to get there, and then you have to sit there for almost two hours before your number is called to hop on one of their trolleys that takes you down into the caves. It seemed very disorganized and you would think it would not be the case, since they've been operating for years. Maybe it's just the time of year where they were more busy than normal? I read another review where someone suggested not going out of the hotel after 10:00 pm. I found this not to be the case at all. There were tons of people walking around at this time and we felt totally safe. All of the locals seemed very friendly, though many cannot speak english (yet here in the states, many jobs require us to know SPANISH...) The strip is very commercialized with McDonalds, Wendys, etc. on every corner. But don't expect fast service from a fast food restaurant. They work at a snail's pace. This is not a bad thing, just different from what most of us Americans are used to. Very few employees can speak english. We went up to a drive through Burger King and ordered a plain hamburger and five piece chicken nugget. Upon leaving the drive through we opened the bag and found 5 ORDERS of chicken nuggets!! All in all, the trip, accomodations, and people were great. Make sure you visit Wyndam El San Juan down the street if you have children. They have a tex mex restauranton the 10th floor with free mechanical bull rides which was a huge hit with kids. Our kids rode it a few times and we didn't even eat there!! Their grounds are also fantastic, but go in through the side door if after 7:00 pm, since their lobby turns into a see and be seen at that time with people dressed to the nines (in their opinion anyway) and you will be turned away if you are dressed casually.Regards!

<Content>Had a great vacation here Our family of 5 just spent a week at the Embassy Suites San Juan and had a very nice time. For an extra $100 or so per night (during what is probably their busiest week of the year) we were able to get adjoining suites, which allowed our teenage girls to sleep in one bedroom which had two double beds, and my wife and I to sleep in the other bedroom which had a king sized bed. Our 9 year old son was very comfortable sleeping on the pullout couch. The rooms were cleaned well every day. A good breakfast buffet was included every morning. There was scrambled eggs, home fries, sausage, bacon, french toast, grits, assorted cereals, pastry, croissants, muffins, fruit (melon, bananas, oranges, pears, apples, etc.), assorted breads, yogurt, assorted juices, milk, american coffee, puerto rican coffee. You could also request cooked-to-order eggs (i.e., various omelets, pancakes). All-in-all a very good selection. When the hotel is crowded they open two breakfast lines, one for those looking for a cooked-to-order breakfast, and the other an express line. This worked out well. From 5:30 - 7:30 every (yes every) evening, there is a manager's reception offering cocktails and snacks (nachos, popcorn, pretzels, etc.). Many guests took advantage of this cocktail hour, but the drinks flowed freely, and we never had to wait more than a few minutes in line for our drinks (you can get two at a time). The Pina Coladas and Strawberry Mararitas were a big hit with the kids (yes, you can get them with or without liquor). I was pleasantly surprised to see they were using brand-name liquor for the cocktails (i.e., Skyy vodka, Cuervo tequila, Don Q rum), okay, maybe not top-shelf, but it was free, and the drinks were made as strong as you wanted. Tipping the bartenders was obviously well received.The pool area was nice and clean, with the exception of the hot-tub. Although the hot tub was clean the first day, I noticed a steady degradation of cleanliness through the week. Although the hotel is very close to the airport, and you can hear and sometimes see airplanes as they approach the airport, I would not say it was troubling at all.The pool bar is only open for a few hours around lunchtime, but the bar a few steps inside the lobby near the casino is open almost all the time, so if you want a drink near the pool you can get one there if the pool bar is closed.The Casino is small,and there are no smoke-free areas. I'm not a gambler so this was not an issue for me, but if I were I would probably spend my time at one of the larger, more glitzy casinos near the beach.** Budget Traveler Tip*** There is a Pueblo Supermarket very near the hotel (well within walking distance). It is extremely clean, and less expensive than the markets near the beach, and obviously much less expensive than the hotel for lunch. Instead of going straight out of the front of the hotel toward the beach, take a right and go down along the side of the hotel toward the thruway. Follow the sidewalk for about 100 yards and you will be in the parking lot. Buy your own beer, wine, liquor, etc. and pour your own cocktails at the pool if you want one before the free manager's reception. This will save you about $5 a drink. The only exclusion around the pool is glass, so buy cans or use cups. Pueblo has a small salad bar, very fresh produce, and a deli (with some hot entrees). They also sell fully cooked chickens for $6 each. Outside of Pueblo there is a Hebrew National hot dog cart where you can get a dog and a drink for $2.The Embassy Grill Restaurant was decent, as hotel restaurants go. The Outback Restaurant was exactly the same as every other Outback, as expected. *** TIP *** Be aware that many restaurants include a gratuity on their bill. It is clearly stated, just make sure you look for it.All-in-all the hotel offered good value and a pleasant stay. Although only a short walk o the beach, those planning on being on the beach every day may prefer to stay at a hotel on the beach itself.

<Content>Embassy Suites are great We stayed there for several nights in Feb. Service was outstanding, breakfast was very good. Evening cocktail party very nice. Close to the beach. Close to the airport but no plane noise in the rooms. Rooms clean and large.Large grocery store a block away. Many great reataurants in the area. Don't waste your time going to the rain forest--long tedious trip to see lots of green plants, no color and no birds. Old San Juan is interesting.

<Content>Embassy Suites, very fine hotel Due to the storms in Massachusetts, our return from Puerto Rico and our cruise was delayed. We ended up staying 4 days at the Embassy Suites. The amenities were great.....beautiful pool, restaurants, location, but most of all, the staff were great. First day, the Desk Manager took about 15 minutes to put my laptop on the Vlink internet system. That proved to be a very big plus. For the 4 days we stayed, our tourist trips were so nice...with Sunshine tours and taxi rides to Old San Juan. Our one very negative experience was our ride to the airport from the hotel. The taxi driver drove about 20 miles an hour, charged $17. for a trip within the Isla Verda zone, and then tried to rip my husband out of an extra tip. All of our other taxi drivers who had driven us places were fair and helpful....(about 6 or 8 taxi trips.) It was one of the Turisto taxis.

<Content>Pleasant We arrived in Puerto Rico on Dec 10, 2004. On our first night, we stayed at the Embassy because we arrived during rush hour and didn't want to deal with the traffic heading over to the Wyndham Conquistador. When we first walked into the lobby, we were pleased. It had a beautiful courtyard. Front desk staff was courteous and helpful. Room was clean and spacious for two people. They had great restaurants within the hotel so we didn't need to leave to get a good bite to eat. We got a great deal from Hotwire for $122. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Reasonable price, reliable accommodations I spend two weeks in PR each December for work, with weekends tacked-on at the beginning and end of the trip (thank God for expense reports). I typically stay in the Isla Verde area, for its relative convenience to the airport, and access to expressways out of the San Juan metro area. I've been doing this for the past 6-7 years now, and have stayed at the higher-priced El San Juan and Ritz in the same area, and think that for value-for-the-money standpoint, you can't beat the Embassy Suites. It's 2 blocks from a public beach (admittedly not as spectacular as the private beaches of other resorts) but it has a nice pool area, small but fun little casino and a good 'ole American Outback Steakhouse in the lobby (along with a two small lounge/bars). They also feed you a free buffet breakfast daily, which is not 5-star, but hey, it's free. So after you stuff yourself full of free breakfast, you go nap at the good-sized pool with waterfall and plenty of lounge-areas. Then you go back to your two-room suite (which is at least twice the size of rooms in other hotels in the area) and take a nap on the couch in your living room and watch a movie. Meanwhile your spouse of the kiddies can be doing their own thing in the other room. The hotel lobby is quite pretty, and as with most all Embassy Suites is a full-height atrium affair with tropical plants, palm trees, etc. I've stayed here for the past 4 years, and love it more all the time. They added in-suite (room service) dining for the lazy (or those who have too much work to do, or are too prone to stopping by the casino for 8-10 hours every time they walk by), and the food and service is quite good. Housekeeping is great, and the room is spotless every day. Overall facility maintenance is also pretty good, though my current room could use a coat of paint. The carpeting is plush and clean. The linens are clean and good. I spend more than 100 nights per year in hotels for work (and another 20 for pleasure) and the Embassy Suites Airport in San Juan is pretty high on my list of convenient, and also importantly economically feasible lodging choices anywhere. If you book in advance, rates here are at least $50-$100 per night cheaper than any other comparabe options in the area. For that savings, I'm happy to hop into a cab to go out to Old San Juan or even over to Dorado/Carolina for some night-life. The hotel is also within walking distance of the El San Juan which has a good nightclub and casino, as well as the Ritz and several others. All in all, you can't go wrong in this place for business travel, and frankly I would think it a pretty good choice for family travel too.
