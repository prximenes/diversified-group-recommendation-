<Content>Fabulous Huge suite with wonderful view of the harbour. Fully equipped apartment, you could live there. Excellent staff and service.Good pool with a hot tub and a small gym.The restaurant is not worth bothering with but that is not the point of this type of hotel.Couldn't recommend it highly enough.

<Content>FANTASTIC! 5 Star Accomodation Our stay here was fantastic. Our suite looked directly out at the Harbour Bridge and over the ferry terminal at Circular Quay. It was 2 mins walk to the Opera House  Botanical Gardens. Everything worked fanatsic for us as Circular Quay is a public transport hub with ferries, MRT and taxi ranks. We wished we were staying for New Year as the view of the fireworks would be amazing. The children enjoyed the street theatre on the Quay each time we went out, watching all the boats come and go and the lights at night from the bridge and Luna Park.We booked a 2 bedroom harbour view suite via the online hotel website. I guess the other rooms would look out onto the street/Botanical Ganrdens. We stayed here as part of a 3 week holiday in SIngapore  Australia. We stayed for 7 nights. We are a pretty fussy family and only stay in 5 Star accomodation. We booked a serviced apartment as opposed to 2 connecting hotel rooms as we wanted some kitchen flexibility with our children plus the washing machine/dryer was great. They were really spacious. It had a fully stocked fridge (which is chargeable) Also I found that the Quay Grand was in a better location with better prices than some of the hotel accomodations. Everything we needed was right on our doorstep..from supermarkets, Pharmacies, ATM's, restaurants etc., David Jones the department store and QVB are either a 15 min wlak or just 1 stop on the MRT.Prior to arrival there had been high winds and on the day of check in our apartment was no longer available as the balcony door had been damaged. It took them about 15 mins to sort everything out but all was fine. The Manager on reception was great. Whilst the Quay Grand suites do not have the same quantity of staff as a 5 Star hotel we had no issues whatsoever. Room Service was fast, there is a big restaurant on site, rooms were cleaned daily etc.,I have to say this accomodation exceeded our expectaions. We met up with family Sydney and teh family members were also saying it was a fantastic location. We would stay here again if we returned.

<Content>Totally amazing What can you say about this hotel!! Just go. You can't beat the location and the attention to detail from the decor, the service and even room service is spot on. Our holiday was made even more special because of the quay Grand which had been recommended to us by several friends who had already stayed there. We had a few problems with our luggage when we arrived (airline lost a bag and then it turned up damaged) and they helped with co-ordinating arrival and complaint to airline. The hotel food was better than average and the setting just amazing.

<Content>Amazing Location, Accomodations and Service One of the best things about the Quay Grand is the location. It鈥檚 located on the harbor so when you walk out of the hotel, you are steps away from Sydney鈥檚 rail station and the main ferry hub, meaning you can get anywhere in the city very quickly. When you look across the harbor, you get a great view of the Sydney Harbor Bridge and when you look to your right, you鈥檒l see that you are just a few hundred yards from the Sydney Opera House. When you look out of the front of the Hotel, you will be facing the Royal Botanical Gardens, which are beautiful. You are less than a five minute walk from the Rocks District, where you鈥檒l find great dining and shopping. The staff was extremely polite and very attentive to our needs. My wife forgot several valuables when we left and the hotel kept them secured for two weeks until we could return to retrieve them. There is a nice bar on the second floor of the hotel that has a great view of Sydney Harbor and there are other restaurants and shops all within steps of the hotel. The rooms were extremely spacious and comfortable. Our room had a washer/dryer and complete kitchen. Internet access was also reasonably priced and very fast. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Perfect Location and Set-Up for Families I just returned from a one week stay in a 2 bedroom apartment at the Quay Grand Suites in Sydney with my 2 small children (2 years and 8 months). I can't say enough good things about our stay. The location is ideal. It really could not be better. It is difficult to travel around Sydney by taxi with a baby (you must pre-order a special taxi with a car seat) so it was very convenient that we could get everywhere by walking or ferry. It was very handy having a kitchen and washer/dryer with the children too. Our view of the harbour was amazing and my 2 year old loved watching the big ships and ferries come in and out of the harbour. The staff was helpful and friendly too. I thought it was good value for money considering we would have had to get 2 connecting hotel rooms if we had stayed somewhere else and we wouldn't have had the convenient of the kitchen, living room, and washer/dryer. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Sydney with small children.

<Content>Fanatstic Place! The Quay Grand Suites is perfect! The staff is excellent, rooms are lovely, and the view can't be beat. I stayed, with my daughter, on the harbor side. I was a little concerned about the noise as I'd heard it could be an issue. The noise was NOT a problem at all. Also, we had a 1 bedroom suite with a pull-out couch in the living area. This is an option in at least few of the 1 bedroom units. It worked out so well! You can close a sliding door and completey separate the rooms - total privacy just like having a 2 bedroom. We loved it here and can't imagine there would be a higher rated place to stay!

<Content>Fantastic Location and View! After discounting this apartment hotel due to the cost, I relented later on and decided to just pay the extra, as it had received such good reviews on Trip Advisor. We are so glad that we did!On arrival at Circular Quay Station, it was just a short walk to the hotel, and we were greeted as though we were really important! After check-in, we were escorted to our apartment and shown where everything was.It was a one-bedroomed apartment, with the most amazing view of the harbour, the bridge, and the ferry terminal, with all the activity of the harbour contributing to the excitement of our situation. The view was brilliant both during the day, and at night.With the doors closed, there was really very little noise from the ferries and the hussle and bustle of the world below.The location could hardly be any better. Circular Quay Station is only a short walk from the hotel, and has a direct line to/from the airport and the rest of the city. As well, the ferries leave practically from your doorstep, to all areas of the harbour. The Opera House is also only a short stroll away.The only negative is that it is quite expensive, and doesn't seem to do many cheap deals online, but I guess they don't need to!I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a superb location and view, and would pay the extra to get a harbour view if finances permit.

<Content>sensational Booked online from the Quay Grand website.From the moment we arrived, everything was excellent. The valet had our car parked and into our room in under 20 minutes.The rooms are brilliant, large, clean and very well appointed. We had a garden view room, which was better we thought than the Quay side, as there was no noiise and was very private.We will definately be going back, excellent value for money when you compare the location and the quailty of the accomodation with other leading five star hotels.

<Content>Wonderful hotel with great staff We've stayed at many five star places in Australia, but the service at this place was far beyond anything else we've experience in Australia. The staff were pleasant and helpful, without being snooty.The rooms were fantastic: great views, great amenities. And the location was perfect. Right in Circular Quay.Highly recommended.

<Content>Lovely view We have just had a lovely one-night stay in a one bedroom harbour view apartment at the Quay Grand Suites. The first thing I should mention is the staff are extremely friendly and welcoming and we immediately felt right at home. Our room was spacious with a lovely view of The Harbour Bridge and Circular Quay ferry station and concourse, and good sized bathroom with spa. The fixtures and furniture were a little dated, but the apartment had everything that was needed for a fantastic stay. The bed was comfortable, plenty of towels and a fully functioning kitchenette with coffee mugs, toaster, microwave etc. It would be easy to stay here for a week and have everything you need at your fingertips. There are also movies on demand and a flat screen TV in both lounge and bedroom areas. Plenty of wardrobe space too!With Circular Quay ferry and train stations, bus stops and The Opera House right on the door step, it's perfect for those who want to be centrally located in the city. There are lots of restaurants to choose from and the hotel itself has room service and a restaurant and bar. We enjoyed the breakfast which was delivered promptly at 9 am, (it needed a slight reheating but otherwise was delicious). The only drawback was the sound of the ferry whistles early in the morning. I am an early riser and it didn't bother me a jot, but I could imagine if someone was a light sleeper and wanted a lie-in, it might be annoying. All in all it was a very nice experience.

<Content>Fantastic! We love this place! We stayed here for the Australia Day long weekend as a weekend away and everything was perfect. We got to see fireworks, the hussle and bussle of the city, the ferries coming in and out and just the general beauty of the landmark Harbour Bridge. The service was great - the rooms were spotless and the right size. Everything worked perfectly.Great walking distance to everything.Would have no hesitation whatsoever recommending this place!

<Content>Great location-Great room My 10 year old daughter and I stayed in a 1brm harbour view suite for 4 days. It was fantastic. I'm not sure this location on Circular Quay could be bettered. The Quay Grand was fab. Sydney is virtually on your doorstep as it takes 1 minute to get to the ferries, trains and buses. If you have a travel pass,as we did($95 for a week, one adult and child for all buses trains and ferries plus the airport train both ways), you venture out every opportunity you have. We got ferries to places we wouldnt normally go (like Watsons Bay) because we could. We arrived at 9 am and were able to check in to our room straight away.The apartment (Rm 702)was perfect for us. Quite high up so nice view of the Harbour Bridge. No view of the Opera House because it is right next door! There was no noticeable noise from the ferrries and trains when the balcony door was shut and just a pleasant sound of people going about their business when it was open. Nice place to sit and people watch. Room service was great and very quick. The pool was very nice too. Lots of cafes right next door and a great movie theatre next door that shows art house sort of movies. We had an issue with the appliances not working in the kitchen(fuse had blown)but it was resolved quickly. The staff were friendly and showed an interest in what we had been doing. I loved it and cant wait to stay here again. Would be even nicer if it was a little cheaper but I would still return.

<Content>Great start to our honeymoon We stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of our honeymoon. We had a one bedroom suite overlooking Circular Quay and the Harbour Bridge and couldn't have been happier with the view or the room itself.With the ferries, trains and buses right outside the rest of Sydney is at your doorstep. Great restaurants nearby (although a little pricey) and perfect for strolling round the harbour, botanic gardens and the CBD.Local calling was very expensive - use your mobile!

<Content>Complete package We have just stayed two nights while some home renovations were completed on our Sydney townhouse.We chose this property for its prime location and our knowledge of the good standards we could expepct from the Quay properties.Quay Grand is clean, comfortable and conventional. Our suite was well equipped and appointed overlooking Circular Quay. Air conditioning was challenged by the afternoon sun and blinds had to be kept drawn but generally it was fine. Check in / Check out personnel were friendly and did a fine job, other service areas were not of the same standard and dining room service could be more energetic.They don't sell their product appropriately, they don't draw you to the facility and the food and drinks don't have the touches that you would expect from a 5 star property charging top dollar. Looks as though Quay Grand is not really attempting to compete with the establishments available in the immediate precinct when it comes to food and beverage.Certanly a good accommodation choice in Sydney's CBD.

<Content>Wonderful I cannot add any more superlatives, but I will- this is truly a great place to stay. My huge balcony overlooked Circular Quay and Sydney Harbour Bridge - particularly moving on 'sorry' day - as the Aboriginal flag flew alongside the Australian on the bridge. I only wish I had stayed longer than my 3 nights - it was truly a wonderful place in a perfect position.If you do stay with a family and do not wish to cook - try the excellent Chinese restaurant just along from the hotel towards the Opera House, it does takeaway if you ask - one meal from there will last you two nights!

<Content>Great Location We stayed in a one-bedroom suite for 5 nights at the end of February and couldn't have been happier. Our 17 year old daughter was with us and was very comfortable on a pullout couch in the spacious separate living room. Both the bedroom, with king bed and ample closet space, and the living room have flat screen TVs (living room is also equipped with DVD player). Great views out of large picture windows with a small balcony. The bathroom was clean and spacious with a separate shower and jacuzzi tub. Really liked the washer and dryer tucked into the streamlined kitchen. Location was ideal as bus, ferry and train stations are right out the door plus the cruise ship terminal is also right there (we were disembarking from a cruise ship and walked to the hotel...a very reasonalbe walk even wheeling luggage). Staff were very helpful and we were able to check into our suite immediately despite arriving 3 hours before check in time. Wireless internet was not free, maximum charge per day was $29.00 Australian.I would recommend this hotel wholeheartedly.

<Content>Perfect location  Stayed here in March 2007 for a week (I know - I'm a bit slow writing my review). The location is a perfect base for exploring Sydney with great views no matter which side of the apartment block you stay in. The accommodation is spotless, roomy and has everything you need. The staff are endlessly helplful and nothing is too much for them. Would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Sydney - it's got everything at its doorstep.

<Content>Perfect Place to Stay We stayed last month (October) in the Quay Grand Suites. It was excellent. The suites were very spacious, exceptionally clean, and nicely appointed - even the corridors leading to the rooms had a very classy decor. There was a full kitchen with a washer and dryer, dining area, living area, and seperate bedroom. The baths were very nice with separate shower and whirlpool tub (which we did not use) and the towels/linens were large and soft. Beds were sooo comfortable. Flat screen tv in living area and bedroom. However, the greatest part was the balcony overlooking the Circular Quay - watching the activity of the Circular Quay really captured, for us, the essence of Sydney. Definitely get a harbor view room. We requested a higher floor and was on 8th floor and had excellent views of the harbor bridge. Could not see the opera house from where we were but the views were spectacular and watching the ferry's come and go was very cool. The hotel was in such good proximity to everything as far as walking was concerned.Did not eat in the restaraunt there but had breakfast as room service and it was very good. The pool was not somewhere you could bask in the sun at but it was indoors had a nice lounge area a few stairs above it that was great for relaxing and reading a good book as you watched the hustle and bustle of the Circular Quay.The staff treated us with the greatest of respect and was so courteous, helpful, and I can't say enough good about them. We booked through Asia Rooms (which I would not recommend)several months prior to our stay and paid in full up front - just to get there and find they had not received anything from Asia Rooms regarding reservations. They graciously went on and put us into a room and said they would work out all the details which I thought was not really their responsibility to do. In less than 30 minutes we received a call saying it had all been worked out. Just very professional and above board service.

<Content>Excellent hotel.... Quay grand suites is a perfect choise. Situated in the harbour near all shopping and restaurants. The rooms are beautiful furnished and with a beautiful view over the bridge. You have your own jacuzzi and a big plasma tv. The staffs are great. So if you search for luxury hotels with beautiful view in Sydney...yopu have to stay at Quay grand suites.

<Content>Best Family Hotel in Sydney This hotel is in a fabulous location. 1st time visitors and tourists will love the views (get a harbour view room - well worth the extra money) but the rest of us will still be blown away!We stayed here with our 1 year old son - he loved watching the ferries and the spa bath!!!! The suites have a proper kitchen (not a galley), great bathrooms and comfy king size beds.We booked the grand night in package - we were a little disappointed - you had to microwave your own popcorn, and the hot chocolate was from a sachet - but other than that everything was fantastic.The service was friendly and helpful.

<Content>Great view, bad food We stayed at the Quay Grand for 1 Saturday night to celebrate my b/f birthday. I booked a package that included a harbour view with $100 room service, wine on arrival, after dinner liquers, breakfast the next day and valet parking. The view was amazing, Bed very comfortable - would have been great if you could see the view from the bed as well, the room had everything you needed. The room had a bit of wear and tear - but it was clean. Towels were thin and rough. Service was very helpful and friendly. We were disappointed by the quality of the food. Both the room service dinner and breakfast were disappointing. They also forgot to bring the after dinner liquers. Checking out was bit complicated. They didnt know that I had booked a package. So i had been charged for some things I shouldnt have. They let us park the car for the rest of the afternoon so that made up for the confusion.We went to Cafe Sydney for lunch the next day. It was amazing. Food and service was the best I have ever experienced in Sydney.So I would stay at this hotel again but maybe not for a special occasion.

<Content>Wanted to move in I stayed here for two nights for my birthday last year with my boyfriend and it was brilliant. The one bedroom suite was large and immaculately furnished, there was a full sized marble kitchen, dining table, flat screen TV (with DVD) in the lounge and bedroom, huge bathroom with a massive spa you could really splash around in, not like those teeny-tiny corner numbers where your knees end up around your ears. The balcony was also big, with a great view of circular quay looking across to the MCA and the harbour bridge. Also the staff were great, really friendly and helpful and not stuffy at all. It's great to stay somewhere five star where you've got a bit of space and aren't locked in an airless box. The oyster bar is just downstairs too, if you feel like splashing out on champagne and seafood. I'd go back in a heartbeat (if I had the money!) and the only thing I'd change would be the fact that if you put a dvd on in the lounge you can't watch it in the TV in the bedroom. And do shop around on the internet for the best deals - I saved over a hundred bucks a night by looking around.

<Content>Perfect location for first time visitors to Sydney For the first time visitor to Sydney the location of the property is perfect with Harbour view suites providing stunning views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Sydney Opera House, The Royal Botanic Gardens, and The Rocks are all within walking distance. Circular Quay also has good rail, bus and ferry services to other attractions in Sydney.The suites are well appointed with a fully equiped kitchen, washer/dryer, bathroom with seperate shower, two LCD TVs, and a CD and DVD player. Decor is always a matter of personal taste, and I would have prefered the decor to have been more contemporary.The gym is quite small and those who want a workout would probably do better to join the locals at one of the many city gyms that sell day passes. I would also recommend skipping breakfast and making the most of Sydney by going out for breakfast somewhere different everyday.Would I stay at this property again? Possibly not. Whilst I can't fault the stunning views from the suites, there is much more to Sydney than Circular Quay. An experienced visitor to Sydney who has already seen the major sites and views may become a little weary of the crowds of tourists around the hotel at Circular Quay.

<Content>New Years Eve at Quay Grand We stayed 6 nights in December/Janauary including New Years Eve. The apartments must be the best place to stay in Sydney. The position is absolutely ideal, central for everything and everywhere. The hotel is excellent, very friendly and helpful staff. Our apartment had the harbour view which is spectacular, however the apartment was bit tired it could do with refurbishment. The swimming pool is very good for a indoor pool. Needless to say New Years Eve was breathtaking, we arranged the dinner table to accomodate the best view of the bridge and we ate and drank whilst taking in all the festivities, a memorable occasion.I would recommend the hotel to anyone.

<Content>Perfect accommodation in a perfect location We had a week in a one bedroom suite with a harbour view at the end of September this year, in the middle of a 6 week holiday in Australia. This accommodation is suberb, very well furnished, very clean and has all the facilities you could want. The seperate utility room with washer / dryer was fantastic and the rest of the apartment was very, very comfortable. The whole front wall of the suite is glass, the balcony was superb and the views spectacular, the bridge is framed in the window ! We got a real buzz from this accommodation. We overlooked Circular Quay, looked over to the Rocks and the hotel is actually on the Opera Quay. The Opera House is about one minutes walk. Fantastic. Would love to go back.

<Content>Great location and what a view! Stayed here twice whilst touring over the summer and it was an enjoyable experience both times. Staff are polite and friendly. Nice swimming pool with great views across the harbour. Fantastic location and within walking distance of the Opera House and views of the harbour bridge. Rooms were clean and well equiped and food in the restaurant was of a high standard with friendly bar staff.

<Content>Loved it! Stayed for part of honeymoon Stayed for 3 nights at the end of our honeymoon in Sept 2001 in a one-bedroom suite with harbour view. Loved it! Excellent location, fabulous view. Extremely spacious and very clean. Full kitchen, living room, dining room, bath, bedroom and (the best part when you have already been on the road for nearly 10 days) a laundry room! Nice balcony. Went out with friends and did not dine at the hotel. Back then, the US$ was strong and we got an excellent rate of US$150/nt.

<Content>Fantastic We booked 3 rooms and hired the ECQ bar to celebrate a 40th birthday party. The hotel, staff, food were all fantastic. The hotel made us all feel special and that they were there to ensure that we enjoyed ourselves. Nothing was too much trouble for them. You can certainly find cheaper hotels in Sydney but if Quay Grand is within your budget then don't bother looking further.

<Content>Great self-contained accomodation I stayed here in room 410 for 5 nights for work purposes. This is a garden view room on the 1st floor above street level. Disappointing view, but I went to the foyer instead for spectacular views! The noise level was surprisingly good as the road isn't a major thoroughfare.The room was great!Kitchen - spacious, clean, good facilities. All amenities included (except dishwashing gloves), including washing powder, detergent. However, coffee and tea not restocked during our stay (disappointing!).Bathroom - silly shower door set-up, oversized toilet seat, but otherwise decent with lots of shelf space. Great corner spa.Bedroom - lots of storage space and fluffy bathrobes. Problems with the TV reception in the bedroom TV (OK in lounge room), and the DVD player is in the lounge, so no watching movies in bed. The study desk is pitifully small (I used the dining table instead). Great blinds, serious darkness is possible.Living room - roomy with comfy couch and good magazines. Widescreen plasma TV (just like in the bedroom), good reception. The pool is only about 15m long and the spa is cold. There is a lookout area upstairs from the pool with great views onto Circular Quay. The gym is basic - one bike, one treadmill, one rower, no cross trainer.I didn't eat at the hotel as the menu wasn't that inspiring. (Try the early bird dinner at the Stamford next door!)I think the location is really good, being close to the restaurants, ice cream parlour, shops on Circular Quay. You probably wouldn't find another hotel as close to a cinema as this; shame it doesn't stay open late. Although pricey, I'm sure this is one of the nicest self-contained apartments you'll find in the city.

<Content>Fabulous room and views! You definitely get what you pay for here. We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment with harbour views. The room was absolutely fantastic, very spacious, beautiful bathroom and fully equipped with everything you need. The view was great as well, which was expected considering the brillant location right on the harbour. We stayed here for one night after staying at another hotel for a week and though twice the price, it was 3 times as good!
