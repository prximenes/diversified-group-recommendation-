<Content>A boat too far The Botel was fine once we found it. For some reason I though the ferry was a private one so took some time to figure out it was the public ferry with destination NDSM werf,after that it was easy. (It was 10pm dark so I have some excuse!) The ferry while simple was too much of a hassel with a ferry every half hour it was not possible to just pop back to the hotel. The rooms were small but had all you need and clean, breakfast OK and a nice bar but I would not go again because of the distance from town.

<Content>disappointed Visited with a friend who had previously stayed a few years ago, we were disappointed with the position of Botel being away from main thouroughfare. Ferry was not a problem as the weather was very good but had it not been the distance would have been very inconvenient. The accommodation was extremely basic and cramped, had to move rooms as blocked drains had sewage flooding into bathroom. Breakfast was ok, nice fresh bread and rolls. Bar staff and cleaning staff were the most friendly.Will not stay again or recommend.

<Content>What a view Excellent value for money. Our room overlooked the sea, and was very clean with a comfortable bed. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially the bar man.Breakfast catered for all tastes, with plenty to choose from. Although the botel is located a little distance away from the central station (city area) we had no problem travelling to and fro as the ferries were running frequently and only took 10 minutesThe shower is a little on the small side (not recommended for anyone over 5'8 or 12st), but again, very clean and well stocked with towels, etc. I would recommend a trip to Ikea as our pillows were a little on the lumpy side.I can recommend this hotel, and will certainly stay there again in the near future

<Content>Give it a miss Spent one night at the Botel which was one night to many.After reading previous reports I tried for over a month to get alternate accomodation however as there was a convention on in Amsterdam there was no suitable accommodation.We needed to catch a ferry from the station to get there then walk with our luggage.We were given a lower level room with a window which opened up to the cement wall of the jetty.The beds were small single which my feet hung over the end.The shower and toilet were designed for dwarfs.Asked to change rooms but was told they were full up.The room smelt of smoke so opened the window to nowhere then we were continually kept awake by other travellers pulling their bags across to steel grate on the jetty which was above our window.The Botel rocked as if it was at sea and I was still dizzy the next day.The accomodation may be suitable for young singles but definitally not for families or seniors like us.

<Content>Great Place Just returned from a couple of days in Amsterdam. Despite the boat having moved to over the water I throughly enjoyed the daily ferry trips to and from Amsterdam city center we did have great weather though might not have enjoyed it as much in bad weather,   The boat itself is moored just a couple of minutes walk from getting off the ferry. It was quiet and the staff were very friendly and tolerate considering I was part of a party of 9 females celebrating a 40th birthday. The cabins were clean though a bit small. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have slept on. The shower/toilet was very small but clean and did the job. The small bar was ok the juke box was put on and the chairs withstood us dancing on them on our last night there. The bar could do with more variation of snacks all they served was cheese/ham toasties or a burger. The breakfast was great value with an assortment of food the little sausages were my favourate. Overall great price...not bad location....and I would go back again.

<Content>warning dont go to amstel botel my partner and i were booked on a three night stay at this hotel,we left after only one night. the hotel is reached by a 10 min ferry ride from the city station and you have to do this each time you want to come and go from hotel, the amstel botel is moored on what looks like a ship graveyard dumped out the way. thier is very little else around apart from one restaurant.the botel itself is out dated and drab,it is no way luxurious as described, the bedrooms are basic,with small wc/shower,our carpet was threadbare, and holes in the curtains.thier is a smell from people smoking weed, which about made us sick.the breakfast was poor and not well presented, the amstel botel is not suitable for many age groups due to its location alone, you really do feel you have been punished in some way be being offered this hotel please think again before you book.

<Content>No problems at all for the money. Happy to go back again soon I booked into the Botel for a 4 night break with my girlfriend at the begining of September 2009. I chose it purely on the price and was not dissappointed. Luckily we both love boats so the ferry crossing was not a problem. Compared with land based hotels on the other side of the river this place really is good value for your money. (OK the word luxury on the side of the boat perhaps shouldn't be there.) When we arrived we were greeted by a really friendly receptionist who explained all that we needed to know about getting to and from Centraal Station at any time of day or night. The ferries are free, and so is the Botel's shuttle bus at night once the direct ferry has stopped. We never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for it.The room was exactly as it was described on the website, basic but clean and comfortable. Great view of a submarine from the window.The bar on the boat is fine, not over priced particularly and again friendly staff.Basically it's a fine place for a cheap stay, you get what you pay for in this life so if you want luxury accommodation go elsewhere, but if you want somewhere to get your head down, that's a bit different go to the Botel. There's a good restaurant / bar on the quayside too but it closes early in the evening (you have been warned). The only thing missing is tea  coffee facilities in the room, but you can always get the staf to make you one.

<Content>Good for the money!!!! Reading the prior reviews within this website I had my concerns with our stay. But it was worth the money. Rooms are very clean , very very very small bath tiny tiny shower. Anyways you don't go to Amsterdam to stay in the room.Staff very very friendly and location once you get use to the itinerary of the ferry you could move around very quickly.

<Content>Botel - not recommended I was a little disappointed, if I'm honest. The room was small and not particularly well equipped. The shower and toilet room was tiny - the sink overlaps the toilet pan and there's very little room to turn round in the shower. The carpet was threadbare, the ceiling was damaged and the tiling in the bathroom needed re-grouting. Well over-due for a make-over.I saw nothing to merit the advert on the side of the boat which said luxury rooms from 鈧?4. There weren't even any tea or coffee making facilities.The Botel has moved from its original position and is now a 10-minute ferry ride up the river, so less than convenient for the night life. On the plus side, the ferries were free and run frequently. On the down side, if you miss one, it can be half an hour before the next one so you really need to plan your trip out. It's also not very convenient if you want to go back to get changed or if you forget to take something with you.I must admit that I'd been told it had moved but it wasn't clear exactly where it had moved to. Google Maps still show it in its original position.Considering I booked in January and paid 拢200 for two nights, I came away feeling ripped off. I wouldn't recommend staying at this hotel. I wouldn't go again.The traveller photos on TripAdvisor.com are more indicative of the reality ... particularly the one called the BotHell.

<Content>My Feelings The Botel would have been better left on the canal. At the moment, the boat is on an estuary and there are many cruise ships, and cargo ships going by and the wash from those vessels make the botel rock all the time. Me and my boyfriend stayed at the botel from the end of july until 9th. august. It was very clean and the staff were helpful but it really could do with Tea and Coffee making machine in the room. It was awful waking up and not being able to have a cuppa. Breakfast was filling enough although mostly cold. The ferry was okay going to Central Station during the day but at night sometimes it was few and far between.The biggest hassle was having to make the trip into the city all the time and although the hotel was great, we wont be staying there again because of where it is and also, I was beginning to feel a little sea sickish the last two days because the boat never stopped moving.

<Content>Won't be returning!! We stayed at the Botel 8,9 June, 2008. We arrived at 1300 and had to wait another hour for check in. We did go to the nearby restaurant which had good food. We checked into room 227. The shower did not drain, the front desk person did not care, but did offer to switch us to 235. No offer of assistance, no apologies, no compensation, etc. The rooms are small, but that is not a problem. Most staterooms on ships are the same size. They had lovely warm comforters on the bed, but it was 25 degrees C, so a sheet would have been nice. No top sheet on bed, just huge comforter.Then our confirmation stated breakfast included, but I did not have it printed out, silly me. They offered us breakfast at 10 euros per person, per night. Somehow, no breakfast is worth that much, especially since we were leaving too early the second day to even have had breakfast. The ferry takes about 10 minutes to get to the Centraal station, so it is rather inconvenient. Prices in Amsterdam are outrageously expensive, but no more Botel. Oh yes, the Private Spice channel was interesting................

<Content>Don`t bother Unfortunately this botel has moved from where it was moored and is now accessable by ferry that goes every hour (free) there are no shops or anywhere decent to get a drink,we paid over the odds 拢105 per night and was told we would get a hot buffet,don`t be fooled they don`t do evening meals it refers to breakfast,which was a joke, boiled eggs (hard) bits of bacon  small sausages in a heated tin. When saturday arrived there was not enough to go around  the queues were a joke apart from that there is no seperate smoking area so you can enjoy someone elses second hand smoke,personally i was glad to get away from the place Amsterdam is nice but don`t be coerced into going here you`ll be making a big mistake .colin jones

<Content>Average The Botel takes around 25 mins to get to the main area of Amsterdam the ferry runs every 30 mins and are very reliable they stop around 12 45 most days , and avoid a taxi they charge 35 - 40 euro for the one way journey , you can call the hotel shuttle done just expect it to turn up at the allocated stop you need to ring the number on the bus stop notice board . The Botel itself is o.k. for the price , the rooms are small as you would expect the bar was quite and the breakfast was no very good the t/v had many channels to choose from, our bathroom quite often had a very severe smell from the drains and poor drainage in the shower , the staff are very pleasant overhauls I would not stay again mainly due to its location 1.5 hours a day wasted travelling to and from , but it quite good value for your money

<Content>Cheap and cheerful Hey,I'm not sure what all the fuss is about, we picked this hotel on price and we got what we paid for.Dont get me wrong its not a palace but it was clean, tidy and warm and to be honest if you where expecting something grander then check how little you paid and think again.The rooms are basic but livable.The location is not that bad, the free public ferry leaves from behind central station and leaves you off about 150 metres from the Botel, cant see what all the crying was about. Lazy arses me thinks.The use of the mini bus for collection when returning home a little worse for wear in the early hours of the evening was hassle free.There is a very nice restaurant / bar situated at the end of the quay where the Botel is docked. Dont think anybody has mentioned that as yet.

<Content>Bed was worse than slow painful death In the interest of trying to save my company a couple of bucks, and because I am in A'dam all the time (working for a Dutch company), I tried the Botel. I cannot even describe the torture of this accomodation. First, they have you pay for the entire stay in advance (understandable after the fact). The room itself was adequate, though if you stay on the side facing into the city, plan on getting no sleep until at least 3:30 when the last drunken revellers make their way in. The shower barely fit me, and I am pretty small. And then there was the bed. I did not think it was possible to have a bed that uncomfortable. I booked 3 nights, and can honestly say that my last night, I did not even bother going back to the room. I had an early flight home and just spent the whole night walking around A'dam. I was tempted to check the rates in the Red Light district for just an hour's nap. The bed on the botel was torture. Worse than a Tijuana prison holding cell floor (further to which, I will not comment on my familiarity). In the interest of fairness, while the check-in was laboriously slow, the people were friendly enough. And it was fairly cheap. But I would never go back.

<Content>Stay here for a damp, dark cold expensive room!! I wholeheartedly implore people to look elsewhere in Amsterdam for a hotel - as there are much nicer places to stay!! The last moment website we booked this through gives it an incredibly unrealistic 3 stars...We booked this on the recommendation of a friend who I can only imagine did not spend much time on the botel! I had paid 拢81 per night for 3 nights here, we ended up staying one and finding somewhere else at the first opportunity.The hotel is in a terrible location, way out of the city in an industrial estate, with ferries only crossing every half hour it could take you an hour to get into the city centre... the room we had was freezing, damp, the thin windows meant the gale that was blowing outside was also blowing inside, the bathroom reminded me of a toilet on a train (not one of those nice new trains either)When we then attempted to cancel our room the following morning, the reception staff were unhelpful and impolite, as we had booked through a website they would have nothing to do with us, we simply could not wait to get out of there

<Content>botel rocks First time to Amsterdam for me and was open minded about it, got to the hotel and to be honest i thought the ferry crossing gave a good sense of feel to the holiday. As for the hotel it self rooms were clean, beds were comfy and all staff were polite and helpfull. As for the bathroom yeah ok it was a little small but i have to say the shower was excellent. All in all i have to say i would definiatly book in here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting amsterdam.30Jan - 3feb marc -s/wales

<Content>Small and unique I stayed in the Botel as part of a study abroad trip for a few days in 2006. It was a unique and fun experience. The only downside was that the bathrooms are TINY! No room to get ready. Take one step in there is the toilet and sink and one step to the left and there is the shower. The room I stayed in had what would be the equivalent to American twin beds, however, they were more narrow than American beds. Friends that had rooms that were double or more had larger beds and larger room to move about in the room. There was no TV in our room, was a working phone. They have breakfast every morning and a bar in the hotel. It is in a great location. Every room looks out onto the water. Our room looked out onto the canal and we were able to see boats passing by of all kinds, which was really great. We had an excellent view of the city and the hotel is in a great location. Walking distance to many of things, and if not to where you want to go it is close to a metro station. Service in the hotel was great. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about the Botel.

<Content>great location having stayed at various hotels in amsterdam, the amstel botel has to come tops for location, you are only minutes from central station and within walking distance of all major attractions. Rooms were small but clean and compact, staff very friendly and the choice of food was good.If you are going in the winter months make sure you are well wrapped up as the biting wind off the canal on your approach to the hotel would cut you in half. Only down side is the noise because you are in a boat you can hear people coming and going all the time.Overall a good place to stay

<Content>Once again a great stay Stayed once again on the botel from dec 29th to 2nd january for new year. Had a great time again. OK the rooms are small but who the hell stays in your all day when in amsterdam. Great bar, staff great apart from one guy who is a bit miserable. It's only a 5 minute walk from central station  a 5 minute walk to the bars etc if you know the short cuts!!Never had the breakfast as i prefer a long lie and head out to a bar to get a decent breakie.A bit of a disapointment for me is the botel is moving on the 7th january to another spot over the water to north amsterdam which is a fair bit away so i'm a bit upset as this will be my last time here.All in all a great place to stay.

<Content>Amstel Botel - excellent For the 5th time, we again stayed at the Amstel Botel. Although past it's best, this hotel is well worth the money - this time we got 3 nights for the price of 2 via hotel.connect. Ideal for Central Station - anyone who says its a 15 min walk needs to get a move on, it can't be above 5 minutes even for dawdlers. Easy to find your way back to after a night out; just head for Centraal Station and there it is, no wandering round identical endless Amsterdam streets looking for yours. Rooms very clean, although a bit dated, breakfast fine, eggs, bacon, toast, cereal -all anyone has at home, I'm sure! Staff are always very helpful, even let us check into our room at 9.30am (again) and a handy locked luggage room to leave your stuff in for that late flight home.

<Content>Great Stay Went to stay at the Boat with an open mind as i had read alot of negatives about it. We were very surprised when we arrived and really enjoyed our 3 nights there.We emailed them a few weeks before we went and asked for a top floor room with Canal view. This is what we had (room436). We would not have liked to stay the other side as there is alot of building work going on. The boat is moving in January tho.The room was small with 2 single beds but big enough for sleeping and getting ready in. Spotlessly clean and fresh towels daily. Breakfast was ok and plentiful. Small but cosy bar and ideal for a quick pint and game of pool before hitting the town! . The cheese and ham tosties are the best i have had !!!.I would book to stay on the boat anytime.

<Content>did the job purpose of our trip was 2 nights of partying and this hotel was def the best choice. right next to the train station (4.60 Euro's - train from airport) and the red light district. Watch out for the trams, bikes and other traffic. They don't care for pedestrians at all!!!! check in was slow and they had problems with us paying with debit cards. room was basic but clean and obviously small. we didn't have a canal facing room and were on the bottom floor and it was fine. take some bread for the local ducks, swans and seagulls that pass by your window.The staff were very friendly and when we came in from a night out about 3.30am the night porter was so sweet he went out his way and made us some cheese sandwiches. chiense restaurant next door 'Sea Palace' is lovely. the decor is beautiful and the food just as nice.the Botel has a bar thats quite a nice meeting place if you're travelling with a group of people but you wouldn't spend an evening in there.overall - good choice for a no frills short stay but wouldn't recommend for a long holiday or a special romantic break.

<Content>The Botel...it's not awful, but don't make it your first choice Not a bad place, but not great either. Amstel Botel had a decent location. The complimentary breakfast was slightly above average. The beds were fairly comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful, exceeding my expectations to some degree. However, the price (considering how worn out our room was, and how tiny the bathroom was), make it difficult to perceive the value at this property. Also of note, the nearby construction can make sleeping past 8am difficult. There are better places to stay in Amsterdam, for less money. While I don't regret having stayed at the Botel, I would have difficulty recommending it to a friend.

<Content>Basic but OK if you don't expect much luxury OK place to stay. Rooms small but generally clean. Avoid lower deck, I stayed there once and the smell from the toilet was pretty dire -staff did not want to acknowledge this so it took much argueing to get them to move me to another cabin. All extras you pay for or pay a deposit. For example you will need to leave a deposit (refundable) for the key to the room safe. Breakfast OK but pricey unless you wnt to eat a lot. Then it is worth it. Allow ten-fifteen minutes to walk to Central Station and the Trams -more if you are carrying luggage. Bar very basic, but OK for a quick drink before going out of an evening or for a nightcap.Having said this I have often stayed there

<Content>Good price The Botel is an exciting 5 minute walk from the Central train station. Although there aren't any hills to climb-there is one street crossing which requires looking out for bike, trams, cars and bikes again! The hotel itself is what one would expect for the price in a major city-basic linens, beds, tv. Be sure to pay the extra 5 Euros for the canal view-much better than the construction on the other side. The evening staff were very helpful. However, when we checked into the hotel around 2p.m. the gentleman at check-in said that breakfast was an extra 10 Euros per person-I explained to him that the rate I booked on his website included breakfast and showed him the confirmation-he would not honor that. So we ate breakfast at a cute cafe by the railstation and only paid 8 Euros for 2 people for breakfast. Be warned that tour groups LOUDLY pass by the botel to eat at the chinese/indonesian restaurant next door.

<Content>great location My husband and I stayed for 2 nights in the Botel. If you are on a budget like we were then this is perfect. It is just like staying on a ferry without the sea sickness! We accidently booked a twin room but the staff gladly upgraded to a double with no cost. Very basic room, T.V with loads of channels, shower and comfy bed. what more could you ask for especially as you are so near to all attractions - just 5 minute walk to red light district, museums + coffee shops etc so you don't need to spend much time in the room anyway. The best restaurant is the Sea Palace chinese right next door. Don't expect a 5 star breakfast, very basic but good. The only negative is that our room was below the dining room so from 7am footsteps echoed through the room so not much chance of getting back to sleep but hey, we are here for only two days so the earlier the start, the more to see!

<Content>loved this hotel My boyfriend and I stayed on the botel in June for 2 nights, next time we will def stay longer. We had a great holiday, the botel is close to everything, only a short walking distance and trams are close by as well. A little warning, watch out for trams and cycle bikes, we nearly got knocked over a few times, the people on the bikes ring there bell at you to move but arn't perpared to stop.Some people are put off this hotel because it is a boat, it may look like a boat but it doesn't move like one. The rooms are small but clean and functional. There is no air conditioning in the rooms, when we were staying it was about 30 degree but we were able to keep cool with the window open. We were on the bottom floor, not much of a view but we were able to watch the ducks float past.I read in a review that people complained about the smell of dope, but i didn't notice it.Overall we had a great holiday and will stay again next time

<Content>Disappointing The botel has seen better days and the rooms are tiny, poorly appointed and you can hardly move in the shower rooms. A long hike from the station and all the attractions of Amsterdam. Breakfast average. Would not return.

<Content>You get what you pay for. I would describe it as cheap and cheerful. If you want to spend a couple of nights in Amsterdam for low cost it ok. I think some of the reviews are totaly out of order for the price you pay they are expecting a 5 star hotel for 2 star prices. The rooms are more like cabins as you may expect on a boat. It an easy walk to all parts of the city and it is quiet. There is a bar on board and basic breakfast. It a bit like a floating Ibis.

<Content>Great Hotel for What you pay. Hi I stayed at the Amstel Botel for 2 nights in September. The rooms are basic but very clean and great value for money. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The location is perfect only 5 min walk from Central Station and 10 min walk from city centre. So very close to everything yet the botel is on a nice quiet canal if you are somone looking for a nights sleep. The only thing about the hotel is the food they do have a breakfast area but besides that you will have to walk over to the city centre for even the small things like tea or coffee. If they hotel had a small menu it would be very handy. Other then that great little hotel.Kathy Ireland.....

<Content>Brilliant location Is very well located - 2 mins walk from central station - easy to get to dam square (about 5 mins walking) and red light district (also about 5 mins) . Would definately recommend for people wanting cheap accom in good location - the only down side is that the bathroom is tiny. Also we stayed water side so I don't know how much noise would be heard if you stayed roadside with all the roadworks, but we didn't hear it at all...Not 5* but perfect for a few nights and we were more than satisfied!!

<Content>Basic but Ok Second time we have stayed, and still cannot complain, rooms were clean, (they did not smell of tobacco etc) Bathroom small but i'm 6ft 3 and could shower without any problems. The only thing i could moan about was the smell of cigarette smoke when eating breakfast - its a non smoking area, but right next to the lounge and the smoke smell tends to drift in through the connecting door. Great if you are on a budget, easy to find even after a long day/evening in the pubs!!?!?!

<Content>big hygiene issue - less than OK We stayed at the Botel for almost a week during IBC conference last week. First impression : the room was small, a floating tobacco smell, apparently clean.After one night, some of my colleagues reported water overflows in the tiny bathroom (shower problem)but even worth, after two nights, one of my colleague started itching and couldn't sleep for the remaining nights as he endured an intense itch.We are just back from Amsterdam and his doctor just told him he got scabies, probably due to inefficient bed cleaning.Then, there's the very noisy environment of the Central Station.On the plus side?Breakfast included and OK.Friendly staff.So it's probably worth spending a few extra bucks and skip this less then OK Hotel

<Content>OK on a budget, not worth it... This hotel is on an boat 5 minutes walk from Amsterdam Central Station. The rooms are tiny. Shower has poor water temperature regulation. Staff are very nice and reasonably helpful. They ask for FULL PAYMENT up front, which should tell you something about the quality of the rooms...they don't want guests prematurely bolting without paying. I have never experienced this before. Amenities are limited to a shower cap in the room, some apples and some sucking candies at the front desk.Breakfast is 10 euros extra per person and is DEFINITELY NOT worth it. Affter one breakfast, we never came back. They will try to sell you breakfast for the whole stay when you check in...don't do it! Poor selection of food, wilted lettuce, only cereal was Corn Flakes. Breakfast is taken down at exactly 10:30...most hotels let you graze for a while after breakfast is offically over.Location is very good...not near sites of interest, but near Central Station which makes transportation to sites very easy. NOTE: You have to walk about 1/2 mile on a boardwalk to get there...taxi cannot bring your luggage directly to the hotel. If you can't pull your luggage, forget it! Facility is clean. Couldn't wait to leave.Barely worth the cost!

<Content>clean and basic Loved the botel clean and basic. We stayed with a couple of friends celebrating my wifes 40th. She wanted to go somewhere to forget it then what better place than amsterdam. Bathroom very small just managed to squeeze my 6ft 4inch frame into the shower. Friendly reception staff. Breakfast basic but plenty of it good place to stay if you want a central location for the city.

<Content>Wonderful Stay After reading some of the reviews prior to our arrival, we were filled with a little trepidation of our stay at the Amstel Botel. This was completely unfounded as we found the botel to be clean, tidy, the staff were very courtious and helpful. The room was a double and frankly very little smaller than the cabin which my wife and I shared on the P  O Arcadia last April where we paid well over 拢6000 pounds, albeit for 14 days and full board.The bar was excellent and friendly with very reasonable prices, considerably less than some of the bars in the city.All in all, for the money , we could find nothing to complain about and we finished our stay in Amsterdam by going next door to the Sea Palace restaurant for a fantastic meal.I can only conclude by saying that upon reading the reviews the most of the complaints about the botel were from Americans, need I say more!!

<Content>Botel, OK The Botel is only a 5 minute walk from Centraal Station and town which is very handy. Building works are going on right behind at the moment and you are likely to be woken up by the sound of a huge pile-driver at 7am.Overall the place is extremely basic but clean which is all you need. The bathroom is tiny, my husband is 6ft 6 and could not physically get into the shower. Using the toilet without cracking your arm on the sink is tricky and trying to reach the toilet paper requires a near contortionist manoevre. Breakfast is basic but sufficient and overall the place is a good, central, cheap choice although we would have stayed elsewhere had we not been in town for only 2 nights. Beware of leaving kids alone with the TV remote, the free porn channel is next to Nickelodeon!

<Content>Great hotel! After reading some of the reviews on here I was nervous about our booking for July 07. I needn't have been. It was great.I still can't understand how our experience could have been so different from some of the other reviewers', except to assume that they thought they'd be staying in a higher-end place???It's clean, it's simple, it's functional and it's comfortable (some of the best pillows I've found on our trip). We chose the bay side for both our room and our teen children's and it was probably a wise choice because it gives one something interesting to look at during down times (and is perhaps less noisy given the construction on the other side).We had little interaction with the front desk people and only had a brief visit to the bar (working men's club). No, it's not luxurious, but it had everything one needs for a comfortable (and clean) stay. We'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>Absolutely horrible I stayed two nights at the beginning of my trip to Amsterdam. It was such a terrible place that I canceled my last night's stay and booked myself at the Ibis for approximately the same price.Reasons why I didn't like the Botel:1) The room smelled like stale smoke, though I think I requested a non-smoking room.2) My room was right under the bar, so it was noisy until late.3) The bathroom was ridiculously small - I'm a small person and hardly fit into the shower4) The reservation website said that breakfast was included, but they wanted an extra 10 euro per day.5) The room wasn't very clean, though the towels were (I think.)

<Content>Fine for budget travelers Stayed for 3 nights at the Botel and overall it was fine for our requirements. It is handily located near the Central station and trams etc so easy to get around town.Staff were pleasant and friendly and there is a small bar.Rooms and bathroom were not large but were clean and the shower while a very small space did have good water pressure. The only real gripe with our stay was the noise from the building site on the dockside during weekdays (starting at 7am). Overall a good budget option

<Content>Keep your expectations very low and you'll do fine here This appears to be a retired river cruise vessel moored near the train Station in Amsterdam. The rooms are small even by cruise ship standards, the bathrooms are what you'd expect in that small of a room, phone booth size. The beds are similar to what you'd expect to find in a state or federal prison as is the smell. What you are getting here is a safe place to sleep and keep your stuff while you see the city. You will not want to spend a waking moment in your room; it's far too depressing and the city is far too interesting.A few points: The guests here are young and noisy. You are given the choice of the canal side with a great view, but the gangway leading to entrance will be loud most of the night with people returning. The other side is quieter but you don't have a view of anything other than some pilings.It is very convienent to the train station. Staff are nice enough. There is a little bar and the usual European breakfast for an additional charge (what's with the room temperature cold cuts and cheese for breakfast? Someone really needs to open a Denny's here...)So as I say, keep your expectations low, consider the price and if you aren't too fussy, it's not a bad place for the money.

<Content>Fine for a couple of nights I first stayed in this hotel in 1996 with 7 friends and would highly recommend it for stag/hen do's or for groups of people/couples who do not care too much about their accommodation and prefer to get out and see things. I returned for one night in July with my husband and it didn't seem to have changed at all since then! That said, it is still fine for anyone who is more interested in seeing the sights than staying in a hotel room. Yes the rooms are small but presumably you only want to sleep and shower in your rooms and you can certainly do that. We may have been lucky but our room didn't smell at all. The bar is a bit smoky but just to the same extent as most of the other bars in Amsterdam. The breakfast buffet is a little limited (particularly for vegetarians - there is nothing hot available for veggies) but there is enough to keep you going. We found the staff to be really friendly and helpful and we were able to get into our room at about 10.30am. If you are going to stay here you may want to note that you can hire hairdryers at a charge, and also safety deposit boxes at a charge. All in all my opinion is probably along the lines of most other reviewers - it's okay for the price, the location is good, and if you can put up with the building work outside it's a decent place to stay.

<Content>A+ in location but falls short in overall value The hotel location was nice because it was close to central station. I stayed on the canal side, which did have its charm and the staff was polite. However, the decor, small size room and tiny shower wore out its welcome. For the money, there are other options available and worth a look.

<Content>Good for the location, not a 3* though. OK, its a decent hotel for its location and proximity to the train station. That said it is not a 3* hotel. It seems that prices in Amsterdam continue to rocket and that is true of hotels more than anything. We paid 鈧?00 a night for twin rooms. In many other european cities 鈧?00 a night will get you moderate luxury but in AMsterdam it seems it will not get you much. On this basis you have to review the hotel for what it is, expensive but in a place where in proportion to other hotels it's in the lower band of hotels. Bathrooms are very small yet clean as are the rooms. We stayed at the end of May and it was 30 degrees for the 3 days we were there - the rooms have no air con and it was very hot. Breakfast was satisfactory and enough bread etc to soak up the previous night's intake of local alcoholic offerings. All in all it's an ok hotel, would I stay here again? only if absolutely necessary - ie stag where it was already booked / decided on. Certainly not one for the couple away for the weekend.

<Content>Interesting concept, but no thanks The Botel looks like a big boat anchored in Amsterdam, and the interior is supposed to resemble cabins on a ship. While this may seem like a fun concept at first, the novelty soon wears off because the rooms are very small and the bathroom is incredibly small, so much so, that it's difficult to move around and not bump yourself into everything. All the rooms are smoking rooms, but ours did not smell, and you can open the windows to air out the room. Also, if your room is on the land side, you are facing the train tracks leading into the station, and there is a constant squealing of the wheels on the tracks as the trains turn into the station. However, if you can overlook this, what the hotel has going for it, is great location. It is a very short walk to the Grand Central Station where all the trains arrive and leave, and most of the buses and trams start and return, so getting around Amsterdam is extremely easy and convenient. Also, as a guest in the hotel, a buffet breakfast is available each morning in a cheerful and clean dining room. The breakfast consists of assorted luncheon meats and cheeses, cold cereals, assorted yogurts, toast and breakfast pastries, and hard boiled eggs, and coffee, tea, milk, etc. The hotel also has a bar/lounge area with a couple of computers that guests can use for a fee, but the area reeks strongly of cigarette smoke. While the location is fantastic, and if you arrive in Amsterdam by train, you can walk to the hotel, I would not stay here again, but would look for something with bigger rooms and bathrooms in the area.One thing to be aware of is that a new subway station is being built right near the hotel and train station and consequently, there is tremendous noise with pile drivers and jack hammers and lots of noise associated with a construction project, and all this activity starts around 7 or 7:30 a.m. and continues to about 4 p.m., so if you are a late sleeper, you may want to reconsider staying here until the project is completed.

<Content>Price good; otherwise..... Okay, this is a VERY basic hotel room. The pro: good price as Amsterdam is expensive unless you go hostel. It is convenient; near the train, bikes, center. You feel safe, depending on who's staying there. There is a safe: you pay a small amt for. The brkfast is 10E; but very adequate, self serve with fruit, cereal, sandwich items, eggs, (soft boiled-overdone as always everywhere); coffee (tea etc), yogurt, bacon/sausage (bacon swimming in it's own fat). I was pleased overall with the brkfst. The staff was very nice/friendly. the cons: The room is very basic, bathroom: miniscule but you can get the job done-just don't stretch your arms out. The room was NOT clean; and in overall disrepair. No hairdryer in room, maybe they would loan you one. No amenities, but there is a soap/shampoo dispenser. They are now working outside and the huge pile driver wakes you up at 7 or 8 am. (wkdays only) Doesn't matter which side you're on, you hear it. It was very hot in the room so we had to leave the window open; inviting more noise; but it was pretty quiet except for the construction. The temp outside was about 60 during the day, 50 at night. It was hard to stay comfortable. Actually, the beds were okay and firm enough, yet yielding. We asked  received a couple of extra pillows-nice. On our floor we had a few doobie tokers (LOL) so it was rather...fragrant. Great for young folks who want to save some Euros, and YES, they clearly advertise that the brkfst is not included on their website. You have to pay up-front-that was different. Guess they expected people wouldn't like the morning wake up call! Cheers, Vicky.

<Content>Great value  The Amstel Botel is a converted cruise ship drydocked right next to Centraal Station. For 89 euro per night, the city view is totally worth the price (but saving on the landview is okay too). Rooms  washrooms are clean and small, but cozy. We didn't get breakfast included, and it was expensive  about average - you can have a comparable breakfast on Damrak for cheaper. Close to Red Light, shopping, tour bus/boat stops and a 5-minute walkfrom Centraal Station.

<Content>Horrible run down hotel Just returned from Amsterdam this morning, after a not so nice short break, at the so called 'Amstel Botel' hotel. We booked this hotel, as there weren't a whole pile of affordable accomodations available, and also, I liked the idea of staying on a boat hotel. Upon arrival, I was very disappointed. There were guests hanging out of the windows of the hotel, which is situated on a very dirty canal, with rubbish flowing all around it. Inside the hotel door, you are greeted with the 'stink' of horrible, disgusting stale and fresh ciggerette smoke ( I am a smoker). The bar, is boarding the breakfast room. It is very small, and not exactly 'easy on the eye'. The worst was yet to come - the bedroom:This room smellt the most horenduous. Stale smoke, dirty walls and ceilings, load noises from outside and inside the hotel, made sleep impossible, and the bathroom was only a couple of feet long - literally!My advice - DO NOT STAY HERE!!

<Content>Horrible Really bad service. We were told breakfast was included and then when we went down next morning we were asked to pay 10 Euro even though our booking was specifically for breakfast included, obviously we had to go and find something elsewhere. Bathroom was very dirty and the noise at night was terrible. At night we went into the bar and the staff looked like they needed a holiday a were definitely not friendly. My friend and I were hungry and it was approx 10.30 at night, spotting some sandwiches in the bar we paid for them and went to our room but proceeded to spit them out they tasted as if they were a week old.This might be a budget hotel but I have been in many budget hotels and hostels and have never experienced such a bad place to stay in.......in other words don't say you weren't warned.

<Content>Go for it !! Amstel Botel, AmsterdamDate. Returned 26 March 2007Just had a wonderful weekend in Amsterdam, Amstel Botel very comfortable, ideal as so close to central station and city centre, no need to taxi or long walk to the canals, bars, etc. Accommodation very clean, bedroom adequate, shower a little small but hell its only for a few days. Staff very polite, breakfast was very good, bar a bit smokey but the Dutch tend to smoke anything so get used to it. Sited next to Sea Palace chinese restaurant which is a must for an evening meal, best chinese we have ever had. If you are thinging about using the Botel do it, excellent value for money, remember this is a capital city hotel, we paid about 拢 78 per night inc. continential breakfast.Anth  Dave Parkin

<Content>Like a hostel, but with a bigger bed. The Amsterdam Botel is about a 10 minute walk from Amsterdam Centraal Station, in the center of Amsterdam. As confusing as Amsterdam is to navigate, this place is very easy to find. You can't miss it, in fact. If you are interested in the quieter side of Amsterdam stay further out. But if you are interested in a night on the town and just a place to crash- this will do.The rooms are very very tiny, a king sized bed taking up the vast majority of space. The bathroom is even tinier. A sink, a toilet and a shower in a 5' sq. space. The shower is very cramped- having a raised floor and lowered ceiling, with barely enough room to turn around. The toliet is squished between the sink and shower. No ventilation in the loo, either. They offer no wash cloths. It is no smoking- and very serious about no drugs, hard or soft. Despite this, the hallways still smelt like marijuana. Very little street noise, but the floors and ceilings are thin- I was woken up both nights just by people walking up and down the halls. Get a room on the bay side, the other side is a mess of construction. Hearty breakfast (coffee, tea, juice, hard boiled eggs, toast, kippers, croissants, sliced meats and cheeses) if you are willing to pay 10 Euro for it. Nice bar area over looking the bay.

<Content>Short break convenience Good central base, easy to reach from station. Early check in allowed - a bonus! 'Cabin' and shower room both very clean. Ample buffet breakfast. Can recommend a riverside cabin at water level. May have been lucky but pleasantly surprised at the lack of noise from inside and outside the Botel. Non smokers may be better off to avoid the bar. Having read some reviews before travelling, wasn't sure exactly what to expect but the Botel, for us, proved a good choice for a few busy days stay!

<Content>Botel hotel Easy to get to, a 5 minute walk from central station. Come out the door turn left and keep walking past tourist info and you will see the botel sign.Good location for trams and easily walkable to Dam square. As for the accomodation, it wasn't bad. It is basic, but you are only really there to sleep. Saying that, at times getting a kip can be a problem. A couple of things were a bit annoying including the overactive heating which made clunking noises all night and the noise of pissed and stoned guests coming back at 5am.Staff are helpful and having read other reviews I can say that there was no issue with the cleanliness of the rooms. Would i stay there again? Probably not, but i would recommend to friends on a tight budget.

<Content>No Problem Have just returned from Amsterdam - stayed at the Amstel Botel - had a lovely room on the top floor, overlooking the canal. Room was very clean with a nice view - bathroom a bit of nightmare, especially if you suffer with claustraphobia - staff OK - some need to exercise their face muscles and try smiling - Breakfast not up to much - food lukewarm, possibly cooked and then stored in a hotplate for quite awhile before it was served. Overall, good value for the price paid - it isn't a five star, but you are not paying five star prices! Ideal location, especially as our flight arrived in Amsterdam at 21.00 - The Botel is within walking distance of the Centraal station and easy to find - about 5 to 10 minutes walk. Would definitely stay there again, but don't think this would be the ideal place in summer when both the city and the Botel are busier as I don't think it would be as peaceful.

<Content>It's OK We found our room immaculately clean during our recent stay. Go for a canal view room if you don't want construction noise but avoid rooms under the bar and restaurant as sound proofing isn't brilliant. Bathrooms really are very tiny. Overall it's an ok place to stay but I wouldn't rush back as I think there are better places to stay in Amsterdam for similar rates.

<Content>OK, BUT.... Booked stay between 15th to 17th October. Location good, close to Central Station (5 min) and City Centre/Dam Sq, (10-15 min).Rooms, (or cabins) clean and tidy, housekeeping very good, staff friendly, especially in bar. However, accommodation is basic and cramped, with little room between beds and dressing table! Toilet/shower room very tight for space.Location very noisy with continual trains passing and extensive construction sites nearby. Be aware when booking, most hotel search siites offered inclusive breakfast but booking through Botel's own 'availaibility  reservations' site does not provide this! It is mentioned in their 'rates' page at 10 euros. Be warned

<Content>Other than the bedbugs...... Initially I had booked the Hotel Damrak but was put off by the reviews on this site concerning bedbugs there. At the last minute I switched to the Botel and just arrived home covered in red welts. The location was good, the room was pretty large in comparison to other Amsterdam hotels, and the breakfast was good, so if you dont mind the bedbugs biting, check it out.

<Content>Fun and fair Hubby and I stayed 3 nights 9 November. Southampton to Schiphol, train to Centraal Station, five minute walk to Botel. Excellent location 5 mins, trains, trams, buses and bike hire. Requested canal room (top two floors ok but not lower floor. Land view of huge building site and railway line but hey you only sleep there! Metalled walkway noisy at night, keep window closed and turn down heating. Small, basic room with very small shower/toilet area but hot water and heating good tho, small beds, good towels and sheets. Good canal view complete with ducks, coots, heron and grebes. Good choice breakfast. Smoking everywhere except restaurant. Staff friendly. Good value for money. Would book again and recommend. C  M, Southampton, Uk

<Content>great value amstel having spent many holidays in Amsterdam and different hotels,i have always wanted to stay at the botel,which we booked ,then we started to read the reports which left us to be just a bit worried.We are open minded people so we felt we had nothing to lose. On arrival it was only a 5min. walk from Central Station .On entering the botel we found the staff to be friendly and helpfull. Our cabin was on the top floor and on the side of the con struction work to my dismay. Being of a tender age i do suffer from tropical moments,and have to have the windows open all year round, we were not disturbed by the noise of any kind day or night. The cabin was clean. The shower room was a tad small 1 person at a time,Breakfast was substancial,we found nothing was to much trouble from the staff,All we can say is if you want 5star then you must pay the differance. We are looking forward to returning again in March and will stay at the botel again.Only this time it would have moved across the river,were thay will lay on a boat to transport you to the botel it may take longer then 5mins. th get into the centre of Amsterdam but it all adds to the fun of the holiday.

<Content>Great place to stay Great place to stay - its right in the city centre next to the main railway station. Rooms are small but clean. There are no mini bar facilities but there is a bar in the hotel. You do get some noise from the train station during the evening and from a nearby building station during the day - but noise is an issue in most city centre hotels in Amsterdam. All in all a great base for exploring the city

<Content>pleasantly surprised! After reading negative critics oft the Botel, we were pleasantly surprised!! The people were very friendly (Philp at the reception was very acommodating) Our rooms were small - but clean and the bathroom is very tiny but my 1,90 husband did just fine taking his shower. We had a canal view our friends had the land side - but there is noise on both sides! Construction on the land side and lots of noisy people going past on the canal side. The breakfast had hot and cold and was available from 7:30 - 10:30. Would I stay there again? Sure for the price - it was good deal.

<Content>Good location, good price This is an older Hotel which could do with a refurb, but is clean. Having said that, Amsterdam is an expensive city to stay in and the Amstel Botel provided a great location for a reasonable price. It was our first stay in Amsterdam and was an excellent location to navigate our way around the city. It was easy to find and an easy walk from the train station, which is a great benefit when you are arriving straight from the airport in a foreign city. Our room was simple and spacious enough so as not to be claustrophobic. Although we didn't ask too much from the Hotel staff they seemed friendly enough. This is a great place to stay if it is your first time in Amsterdam and you are looking for somewhere simple to stay at a reasonable price. We booked through the Hotel website with no problems.

<Content>Location and Value Stayed here for one night on our Europe trip. Location is excellent especially if you are in Amsterdam only for a day or two. We were within a 5 minute walk to the Centraal Station which meant we were able to get a direct train connection from the Airport and walk to our hotel with our loaded backapcks. We were able to catch trams right in front of the station to do to the museums. And when we left we were able to catch our train to Berlin easily too.The view wasn't as great as I had imagined (canal view) but that maybe because we had a lower level room and the canal in the front ain't the prettiest one in the city. But we were minutes from the Dam square and the restaurants and night life.And yes, the shower cubicle is as small as a phone booth! But it had a sopa dispenser!

<Content>Botel - Seven Hi, My wife and I stayed at the Botel this week - Oct 06. The room was ok, clean and tidy apart from the cigarette holes in the curtin. The bathroom is small, but ok. The bed, is advertised as queen size, but they fail to tell you that its two beds together, with a hard wooden area betweem each half. The staff were fine amd pleasent. The location of the hotel is excellent to the city centre. The breakfast is good with a choice of hot and cold. Overall, We would rate it 7 frm 10. Its good value overall.

Our room was fine although for me the bathroom was a little too small but apart from that you had everything you needed.Great atmosphere in the bar.Staff were nice and friendly.The construction work going on outside our window was only heard if you had the window open.If you're planning on seeing the city then this is a great place to stay as you're next to the station and central to a lot of the museums.Will definitely be going back on our next trip to Amsterdam.

<Content>Barely passable So, we read good reviews in Frommers about this place and we booked a room. Well, the weather in ams was extremely hot which made our trip somewhat not fun, but oh well. Our room was very small, but clean. the bathroom was passable, and it had free porn (some may call it a plus).....however, the staff was RUDE and not helpful. Also, it was over priced and hard to get to due to construction. I will not revisit this place.

<Content>Never again - much too noisy We booked in February asking for a non smoking room, if possible on the canal side. When we arrived, we were given a regular room, on the other side (the station side). We stayed there for 2 nights and it was hell. At the reception nobody wanted to know anything pretending the hotel was full. We didn't sleep at all, the noise of from the trains arriving in the station and from a construction site located just in front of the hotel was huge. The rooms are tiny as well as the bathrooms and the ventilation is bad. The breakfast was ok. Do not go to the breakfast room before 8 am or you will find the old bread and croissants from the day before. We payed the full price without knowing that a huge construction was in progress just a few meters from the hotel. We weren't informed by the reception and this is inacceptable. Our advice: try and find another hotel in Amsterdam, this one doesn't deserve a stay.

<Content>Decent Value For what you pay the Botel is just fine. The rooms are decent and clean apart from the bathrooms which are tiny but adequate for an average sized person.The price was good for Amsterdam (70GBP/room/night).The location was very good being walkable to most of the major tourist attractions and only 5 minutes walk from Centraal Station making the transfer from Schiphol very straightforward (and cost effective).Our guidebook placed it in the top 10 budget hotels and if you go expecting a budget hotel you won't be disappointed.The only complaint we had was that the agency we booked it through (GTAHotels.com) advertised it as Bed  Breakfast (and emailed confirmation as such) but when we checked in we were told it was room only. GTA Hotels said it was a mistake and that we should be room only. As this was a problem with the agency the hotel staff, although friendly, were unwilling to help out and wouldn't ring the agency to enquire about it.Like I said, expect a budget hotel and you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Me like. The beds were a bit too hard, the room a bit too drafty, not enough hot water for everyone, and not enough pillows were placed in the room to begin with. When I first entered the bathroom, there was [-] in the bottom of the toilet outlet, barely visible but obviously there. Other than that the toilet was clean. But I liked it! It was clean, provided plenty of soap for both the sink and the shower, and had a wonderful breakfast with bacon, sausages, slices of cheese, cold cuts, eggs, French toast, syrup, orange juice, apple juice, coffee, I think tea, and I think there was other stuff; I might have forgotten something. The breakfast was included in the price. There were so many of us in my school group that some people got the canal view for no extra cost. There was enough room in the rooms to move around in. It's near a lot of hot spots. I recommend it; I give it a passing mark! The whole boat thing makes it somewhat unique. Nice lobby, nice restaurant/bar.

<Content>great base for amsterdam city We have just returned from the Amstel Botel - this is our 2nd stay this year in this hotel - making it 4 in total since last June.The rooms are on the small side - but as we knew we would be out sightseeing in the days and evening it really didn't bother us at all. We just needed somewhere to lay our weary heads at night!!!We stayed in room 316 and have always been lucky enough to be on the 3rd floor - do pay the extra for the canal-view. There is building work going on the other side and it really is not that much more for the canal side. You can sit at your window and watch all the cruise/party boats going by.Whilst we were there the weather was changeable - very sunny and very, very rainy!!! The rooms were warm - but no different to being at home with the windows closed!! My tip - leave the window open when you go out. No-one can get in through the window without a diving suit and a rope ladder!!!The beds are very firm...not uncomfortable firm though - do ask for more pillows as they are very flat. Had we known we could of requested and got more, we would have.There is a small TV in each room showing 40 channels - including BBC1, CNN, BBC NEWS, MTV, various music channel, Film 1 (showing movies constantly), dutch and french channels, porn channel - something for everyone.We never experienced any problems with the bar staff - we brought wine and beers from the local supermarket behind the Royal Palace (very cheap) and the bar staff were quite happy to give us cups of ice for the drinks at no charge.Upon arrival you pay for your room in advance - all over and done with, then you know exactly how much spending money you have left!! The breakfast was 10 euros and you really could eat as much as you liked.The location of the botel is fantastic - literally a 5 min walk from centraal train station and 10 mins (if that) to The Dam (main square in AMS), Damrak and the Red Light District and the flea market.We asked around at various other hotels in the area and they all averaged at about 100 euros per night. Some of these other properties did look slightly dubious - the reception areas were full of people 'smoking the green stuff'!!! Which is fine if you go into a coffeeshop (I can fully recommend Free Adam if you want to try one out - the owners are the most friendliest of people)....however if you want to sit and read the paper or relax in reception you don't necessarily want that going on around you.All in all - I would say that the Amstel Botel is a basic, clean hotel. If you want 5 star then book a 5 star hotel.......we are going back for New Years and would not hesitate in staying there again - in fact we have already booked and only been back home 2 days!!Amsterdam is a lovely city to visit and has alot more to offer than sex and coffeshops.

<Content>Great little boat I went to the Botel with some trepidation, having read all the poor reviews the night before I travelled. I was therefore pleasantly surprised to find helpful staff who accommodated my request for a canal view, a very clean room (which I agree was hot and stuffy but I much prefer open windows to air conditioning), and a comfortable bed. The bathroom was small but laid out so as not to be uncomfortable, and the shower temperature was easily adjustable. We heard no sound from other rooms, only a little from people on the walkway in the late evening. Breakfast was more than adequate. Unfortunately the whole boat seemed to have gone to breakfast at the same time on the Sunday morning, which short of a breakfast rota is something the hotel staff have no control over.All in all good accommodation for the money, and I'd both stay here again and recommend the Botel to others.

<Content>Don't expect a lot and you won't be dissappointed I've stayed here twice with my partner and found it to be ok for what we paid, especially as breakfast was included in the price and there is a lot of choice including hot food. I didn't pay a lot either time and wasn't expecting too much so I wasn't dissappointed. There is certainly nothing special about this place but I have stayed in worse for the same sort of money so I would say as long as you look around to get a good price and you just want somewhere to put your head down it's fine. The shower/toilet room was very cramped and could definately do with some re-decoration as there's was mildew in the corners. The whole place would benefit from a refurbishment but no doubt the price would go up if that happens. The staff weren't over helpful or even really that friend either time but they do their job.

<Content>Better Before? I stayed at the Botel for 5 nights at the beginning of August. The location is very good, being only a short walk from the Centraal station, the Damrak etc. I chose it for the location, and also because I had been there before with my children, as a budget holiday. I also remembered it having the best hotel breakfast I'd ever had. Well, on a second visit it wasn't as good as I remembered, but then I'm older and more experienced now, so it's coloured by other hotels I've visited since. The room was still small, and the bathroom smaller, which didn't matter so much when I was younger, but is a bit of a problem when you get a bit less mobile. The bed was fine, but the view from the window was awful, being a building site, but I had been warned about this. One problem was the thinness of the walls, I could hear everything that was being said and done next door; not something that worried me with two children (we were probably the ones making the noise) but when I was on my own, it either woke me up or stopped me from getting to sleep. The breakfast was not as good as I remembered it, but my memory may be at fault. The staff were helpful and pleasant. Would I go back again? Yes, if I had children and was on a strict budget; no, as I think I deserve something a bit more luxurious now!

<Content>horrible Dont stay at this place if at all possible.The staff are about as much use as a chocolate teapot!Not friendly and very un helpfull.Our room was on floor #2 had a lovely view of the building site and the screeching of trains outside our window every 15 mins throughout the night- not to mention the water pipes gushing out into the canal, and being delighted to see a digger going past my window (a few feet away) as I awoke form my 15 mins of sleep.We complained about the room and had and upgrade canal view!what a shame that we were situated on the bottom floor underneath the walk way and had to put up with the noisy footsteps of anyone walking past.The rooms are very small with a bathroom the size of a phone box.Although the rooms were clean, the breakfast isnt worth 3 euros let alone 10!Biggest downfall for me though was, that they will NOT allow cannabis to be smoked anywhere near the premises.Which is a 1st for me in visiting Amsterdam for 17 yrs.So anyone who wishes to stay here and like a smoke in the evening.... you have been warned, dont go to this place!A 1st and last for me to stay in this god awful place, Ive also spread the word to my friends and family that this place should be avoided at all costs!Blue cheese fan

<Content>Ripped Off At The Amstel Botel Have stayed here many times. Go to Amsterdam 3 times a year and stay in this hotel 99 % of the time. Won't be staying again. Everyone beware of a certain young black bar man in the hotel bar who will rip you off with your change. E.g. You give him 鈧?0 he gives you change of a 鈧?0 note. You tell him change is wrong he tells you you only gave him 鈧?0. The Botel should have cameras on the tills to watch their dishonest staff. Watch out for this scam all over Amsterdam - Even in Albert Hein supermarkets. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS HOTEL after giving it a good review many year ago.

<Content>What can u say??? Problems:NO AIR CONDITIONING (rubbish for summer...!) - had to 'rent' fans (20euros deposit given back when fan given back)TINY BATHROOMS (okay they were cramped but bearable - no windows in them...)FLIES (general tip - do not keep light on and window open at night at the same time, attracts bite eating flies)SMELL ( general problem with amsterdam - that infamous smell of freshly smoked grass)Bonuses:LOCATION ( absolutely fantastic location - 5mins walk to central station which is where all roads lead to!)SIZE (rooms are a comfortable size but if u want privacy forget it!)Hope this helps in some way...I really liked the botel, not just for the idea of sleeping in a boat but because of the fact that it was pretty good value for money...just remember to ask for the canal view!

<Content>Amstel Botel - Its Different ! Just got back from a 1 night stay on the Amstel Botel . my 4th stay over an 8 year period .i stay here when i have an early flight back to the uk ...Its different !Looks like a boat , designed like a boat , rooms like cabins on a ferry , small , functional and clean . ok its dos'nt float like a boat but it looks the part . You cannot beat the botels central position . 2 minute walk from central station , the red light district , the damrak etc .bus and trams on your doorstep . its not a cheap stay anymore 拢70 for a twin room - breakfasts steep at 10 euros a head but you can get a cheeses and ham toasty in the bar at 2.50 euors which suffices !the triple rooms work out better value.to be honest you aint going to get a hotel much cheaper in the city centre - even the hostels are asking over 25 euoros a night for a bed in a mixed dorm !bar prices ok on botel...but try and get your cold drinks for in your room from a supermarket as 1.80 for a bottle of water out the machine is a bit steep !a tip ! stay outside amsterdam city centre - pumerand , volendam , edam etc . plenty of cheaper hotels ith great bus service in and out of the city - you can get a 4 star hotel twin room for 拢45 a night with breakfast .word of warning if you have kids with you and stay on the amstel botel be carefull changing over your tv channels as one is hard core porn ! great if your adults alone but try explaining granny lust to a 10 year old !oh yes and like precvious reviewer said it was extremly hot - temp gauge said 38 in the lobby - no air conditionng but i slept ok with windows open - pay extra for room with canal view but ask for floor 2 and above as floor 1 has view obscured by gangplank .to be honest its an unusual place to stay - quite funky in a wierd 70's way - brilliant for the city centre and travel - central station etc but don't expect luxury and be aware that they eask for payment upfront on arrival !2 many scallies jumpin ship !would stay again for convenience factor alone .

<Content>Well that was an experience ! Just returned from a long weekend at the Botel. It was a stag weekend with 14 guys from England. Having worked until recently in the Netherlands, I was aware of the issues of city centre hotels but the Botel was an experience and a half. The weather in Holland was fantastic last weekend 鈥?hot and humid - but the hotel has no air con, the corridors are very narrow and the rooms are VERY small. This combination results in rooms that have all the attractive features of a baker鈥檚 oven during the day and particularly at night. I鈥檝e travelled the world and stayed in some hotel rooms with small bathrooms but the bathrooms in the Botel wins hands down. Think telephone box 鈥︹€? and I鈥檓 not exaggerating.Some reviewers have passed this off as okay 鈥渂ecause it鈥檚 a boat鈥? It鈥檚 not a boat 鈥?it鈥檚 a prefabricated structure on a concrete base that鈥檚 been made to look like a boat. The beds are small and remarkably uncomfortable, the storage space is nonexistent and there was a grand total of 3 hangers in our double room. The towels are paper thin, and there was no soap in the bathroom. There鈥檚 no tea and coffee making facilities and the ceiling tiles were badly stained from a leak above. I could forgive all of the above if the place was actually cheap 鈥?but it鈥檚 not. 拢70 room only isn鈥檛 that cheap for Amsterdam.Having said all that, I surprised myself in that I actually enjoyed being there. The location is excellent (5 minutes walk from the central station, 3 minutes from the main trolley car station, 10 minutes walk from Dam Square) and for all its faults (and there are many !!) it鈥檚 actually quite appealing. If you鈥檙e looking for a bit of luxury and you like your comforts 鈥?the Botel is not for you. If you are a bunch of lads and/or lasses on the lash and prepared to slum it for a weekend and all you are interested in is location, this place is perfect. Finally, we did wonder if, as we were a bunch of lads on a stag weekend, that they put us in the smallest/cruddiest rooms on purpose 鈥?just a thought.

<Content>Great location - Small Rooms Stayed here with my partner in May 2006 - The weather was absolutely brilliant and the location of the hotel is brillian however, the rooms are veryv small and the bathrooms even smaller. No tea/coffee making facilities however, i had brought my own thankfully.The hotel advertises luxury rooms but when i asked about this i was told all the rooms are luxury - i don't know how.I wouldn't recommend this hotel for long stays as it is as basic as they come and quite costly but i still enjoyed my stay.Breakfast was excellent with much variety and continually topped up.Extra pillows were required and were delivered promptly when asked for and rooms were cleaned daily with loo roll topped up.English channels available on tv including bbc1 for those eastenders addicts and chill out evenings (if ya know what i mean!)Overall a pleasant stay however, i would look around next time to get somewhere cheaper.

<Content>Good service at time of crisis I have already written a review of the Botel based on a previous stay. I decided to go back in March.Unfortunately, I lost my credit cards en route - probably at the airport. The receptionist could not have been more helpful in getting them cancelled, to the point of helping me with my Dutch over the phone while I spoke to Customer Services at Schiphol Airport.What could have been a very stressful situation was ameliorated by his friendliness and professionalism. When I got home a week later, new cards were waiting for me at my local sorting office.That's all!

<Content>Utterly wonderful I read a review on here to ask in advance for a room facing the canal and to be above level 2. Well we asked and we received ! We were in room number 316 and the view was wonderful as well as the lovely smell of Chinese food from our neighbours !The bed was a double and very large indeed. Yes the room was small but you have to remember at the end of the day u are on a ship ! The shower was very poweful and in some cases too poweful. We had to stop showering now and again for the water to drain. When sat on the toilet u are touching the sink as well, but who cares ? not us !On arrival the man at reception was not over friendly and we had to pay for the three nights in advance. Once in my bedroom I noticed only two pillows on the bed and went back down to reception to ask for some more. We went out for the evening and I was a little upset as they hadn't arrived and then there was a knock at the door and two more pillows !In the stair well they have vending machines for soda, beer, crisps and snacks, but the bar on the ship stays open until 12.45am and also has a snooker table, pin ball machine, cd juke box and arcade games. The barmaid did inform us that we should tip her as well when she told us the price, which I thought was a little rude.The breakfast is not worth getting up for early if u have had a late night. Breads, cheese, funny bacon and weird tasting small saugages, with hard boiled eggs and a toaster to 'do-it-youself'. For drinks it was orange guice/apple juice/coffee. Don't even think about a good old cup of tea !The t.v. is good and they have 24-7 great porn on it, as well as all the dutch stations.No air con in the room, so good idea to keep your window open when u go out in the evening. Its so safe as remember u are on a ship !The view is wonderful and u can see all over Amsterdam from your window.I slept the three nights with ear plugs in and apparently my partner said he was only woken up once by late night party people.You need to take shampoo, soap and take your own towl, as theres are kinda thin. Also the loo paper is thin, so might be handy to take some tissues as well. At the end of the stay I did ask if the hotel could look after our bags as we had an afternoon flight back to the UK and we had to leave our rooms by 11am. We they took us to a very small room that was so full of bags on top of bags that it didn't look safe at all so we carried them around the town with us.This is the second time to Amsterdam and I will 110% want to go back to the botel and to be honest it made our holiday going there. How many times do u get to sleep on a ship ? Go give it a try and enjoy Amsterdam.

<Content>Not my first choice... I think it must be said first that this is not a boat. Just a 'boat style' hotel... which means tiny rooms and bathroom. Having said that, if you're on a budget and need to be within 5 minutes of the red light district, this might be the hotel for you. The rooms were clean, although I found the beds pretty uncomfortable. There is no airconditioning, so if it gets hot and muggy, you will suffer. I suggest a room on the upper floors and facing the city. Everyone walking by will see in your room from 'deck' 2 and below and the view out the other side is of a huge construction project. The room includes a 13 tv that includes at least one 'traditional' Amsterdam channel among others. The shower is incredibly small and kept alternating between hot and cold while I stood in it. Some staff are really wonderful, but the bartender seemed uninitiated. There is an option for a room safe. You must leave an 18 Euro deposit for the lock, and you'll get 14 Euro back when you return it. I suggest it is a wise investment. Breakfast is included with the price of the room and I have to say that it is presented in a nice, clean, smoke free dining room. There is a decent selection of cereal, toast, boiled eggs, yogurt and bacon with coffee and juices available.In a nutshell... inexpensive, clean, close to central train station. Small rooms, and downtown location (and their associated problems) are the only detractors.

<Content>No Probs. We have just returned from the Botel this morning and found the hotel to be fine, the rooms are very clean and we found the staff very helpful. We also had to wait for our room to be cleaned but we did arrive at 10.30 in the morning and it does tell you on their website that check in is after 2pm. The only down side is the rooms on one side of the hotel look on to a building site but thats not the hotels fault anyway most travellers just want a clean bed to get into after a day around Amsterdam. All We can say is that all in all its a great hotel with a good location close to the centre of Amsterdam.

<Content>Poor service, noisy  I booked a room around 2 months in advance. Paying the extra for a canal view. Upon arrival the canal view room was facing the canal for certain. Though this was all. They gave us the basement room that looks out to the water of the canal, the underside of the walkway complete with water pipes and the advantage of people being able to look into the room. This is what I was charged a premium for. In addition to this the room stank of cannabis, so this is Amsterdam, but I am sure the room could have been freshened. It was so bad I changed side of the boat (no other canal view rooms available), no view but higher. Well I say no view, there was the view of the railway line (plus the noise) and a construction site (plus the noise). During the process of this room change (around 20 mins) I saw 3 other guests also complaining about the same thing. To charge for a canal view is at best a damn right cheek, at worst a complete deception.The room itself is no way near the standard of a 3 star hotel that it claims to be. 1 star would be complementary. The bar is like walking into a cloud of smoke, no ventilation or air conditioning. Breakfast is not included and costs more than any of the nearby cafes which are far superior. The staff are not at all helpful. No managers were available. Unless you have low expectations I would not recommend this place.

<Content>Careful!!!! Well what can we say about staying at the wonderful Amstel Botel? If you look at all of the pictures of the Botel online then what you see in actual fact is a glossed up image of the establishment! Situated in the midst of a worksite (which doesn't seem to rest!) it is not very picturesque! - But then again most travellers haven't come to Amsterdam for the panoramic views have they!! When we arrived, we found out that our rooms were not ready as of yet, and to come back in 2 hours, or spend some time in the bar...which at 10.30am in the morning isn't really an option. When we arrived back at the check in desk two hours later, our rooms were still not ready! After complaining about this, we were told by the helpful reception staff that as we were not being helpful then they would not be... After a bit more gentle persuasion and pleading from us to they, they told us to sit in the bar and have a drink on them! (Again, after travelling from 4am in the morning, we were a bit tired, it was now 12.30pm!)When we eventually were let into our rooms, I can only say I was surprised by how well they are presented. We had a doubleroom which consisted of a large double bed, but with a thick piece of wood in the middle of it (think of 2 single beds joined together and you get the drift!)It was very clean though very basic.Don't believe the scary reveiews which say that there is no running hot/cold water as this is quite untrue...though watch out for the pressure in the shower...it is akin to a jet washer!The room is equipped with Television and satelite channels including free Adult programmes on channel 31!The breakfasts are also very nice with a large choice from Continental to Cooked, and to cereals.The Bar seems to be well equipped also, but don't beleive the closing times t night because Hotel guests are asked to leave half an hour before it closes so that the locals can use it...We were asked to leave by a rather intimitating he/she barmaid/barman.For the price, it is very adequete though the satff are quite rude and unco-operative....especially Steen!

<Content>the botel is great. If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel in Amsterdam,this is for you. The location is excellent,2 minute walk from Central Station,10 mins from Dam Square. There is some building work going on behind the botel,however only during the day,quiet at night.Rooms are basic but clean and have a small en-suite with shower.Having talked to a few of the locals, many of the hotels in amsterdam have no private facilities!! This alone gives the botel an advantage.The breakfast is also pretty basic but caters for all tastes. Across the road from the botel is a brilliant mexican restaurant called the Guadalupe, this is well worth a visit and is very handy if you are staying in the botel.

<Content>NOT very good me and my partner stayed at the botel for 2 nights on the 3rd feb and it was abit of a disappointment, when we checked in we asked for a canal view and would pay extra if poss,he said no they were fully booked! so we had a room looking at a building site very noisey. we went for breakfast in the morning, stale bread and very little people in this fully booked botel,we come back late on satarday afternoon to find a cheeky invoice under the door saying we were charged 10euro less for our room and to pay it before you leave.. the room itself is ok the bed was big enough but two thin covers,the carpet was abit worn,the bathroom is small with dampness all over the ceiling,there are also no tea/coffee makers.we found the staff not very friendly and didnt seem bothered about us. the only plus point is your quite central, just watch your back i.e. bikes, buses, trams, cars and people etc. hoped this helps

<Content>Great Hotel! My boyfried and I just returned from a weekend away at the Botel (3 nights) and we loved it! It is a fantastic location, you can walk everywhere. We were in Amsterdam in March 05 and we stayed miles away in an expensive hotel and it cost a fortune for taxis. The room was really clean, warm and the bed was comfortable. The staff clean the rooms everyday and bring fresh towels etc. If the porn channel isn't your thing there are loads of other channels (at least twenty). The Bathroom is small but not tiny it does the job.We didn't hear any noisy and the staff were pleasant and helpful. I can't comment on food because we didn't eat there but the Bar was nice and inexpensive. It is also very safe and secure at night.After reading some of the reviews on this site I was worried but need not have been. This is a great place to stay, really different for your normal hotel. Oh and the view from our front room was beautiful and there is the most amazing chinese restaurant next to the hotel. We would definitely stay there again...

<Content>noisy! My wife and I stayed here 2 nights for our anniversary. I have stayed in several hotels in Amsterdam over the last 10 years, and expected the tiny room, uncomfortable bed, etc. etc. (If your lucky a 3 star hotel will be almost as good as a Motel 6, but smaller)What I didn't expect was to have a room below the bar. We checked in at 10am, and I asked for a quiet room (explaining our celebration). We were not only below the bar, we were below the bartenders station. We heard constant footsteps, things being dropped, etc from 1pm-1am. Finally thinking we were going to get a good nights sleep, we were awakened at 4am as they started to set up the room for breakfast.We asked to be moved the next morning, again explaing the circumstances, and were refused.I have stayed here twice before without a problem. Perhaps if you get a room at a discounted rate through the web they give you one of their worst rooms?

<Content>Wonderful botel, wonderful service My boyfriend and I stayed at the Amstel Botel three nights. We just returned from our trip. I was extremely pleased with the accommodations. The botel is in a perfect location, a 5 minute walk from the central train station, within walking distance to one of the main streets in Amsterdam (Damrak), to the canal rides, to the red light district, gay neighborhood, and many coffee shops. I had requested a quiet room with a view and they had let me know that they were going to do their best. Surely, they did. We had a wonderful view of the canal and historic buildings. Our room was quiet and clean. The bathroom was a little small, but it was completely managable. The X-rated movie channel was fun. The breakfast was included in the relatively low price of the room (75 Euros on a week day, 85 Euros on the weekend) and it was delicious. The rooms were warm and you could adjust the heat (we were there in the middle of January). The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They gave us city maps, provided us with directions to where to make phone calls, take the tram, etc. If I had to complain, I would only complain about the unfriendly bar tender. Unlike the hotels in the US, it is not common for hotels in Europe to have ice machines. My boyfriend and I wanted to have some cocktails before venturing out into the nightlife (we wanted to save money, Amsterdam IS expensive) and we asked her for ice. She gave us the weirdest look and almost was rude giving us the ice. Other than that, everything was perfect. The staff really did their best to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. When I read the reviews here, I was a little hesitant and worried, but I realized that my worries were unfounded. I must say, however, we were there during the off season (middle of January), it might be a different story in the summer. However, my experience was great and I recommend Amstel Botel to everyone.

<Content>The Best Location! My husband and I stayed here with 2 other friends. Both rooms were very clean, with everything you needed. (Along with the free porn channels!!) The breakfast was good and plenty of it. Nice friendly reception and bar staff was refreshing. We also used the complimentary room to leave our luggage on our last day as we only travelled home late that night.The location was superb, just a very short walk from the train station and 5 minutes from the Red Light District.For the price of this hotel, you can't really complain. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the ducks quacking very early in the morning!!! (That'll teach us to stay out too late!).Would deffo stay again.Michelle - Wigan, England

<Author>traveling_mom_Boston
<Content>great location After reading the reviews, I was a bit worried. I stayed here for 5 nights with my 2 kids age 5 and 8. It was suppose to rain all 5 days and it was the 1st time my daughter was without the stroller. I needed a hotel close to public transportation. This fit the bill. Central station was a stone throw away and we could get busses, trams, and trains very easily. The kids LOVED it. We had a triple and I thought there was plenty of space. Remember - this is a boat. I expected everything to be smaller, but it wasn't. The shower was tight but I've been in much smaller ones. Only one night did we hear anything and it wasn't that loud. We had a room on the 3rd floor - I would recommend 3rd or 4th. I was worried about the porn on the TV but they turned it off without me asking them. We also had 2 or 3 English kids stations to keep the little ones entertained while getting ready in the morning. I would recommend the Botel for families and groups. If you're there with a spouse there are plenty of other small hotels. Amsterdam is great with kids especially Nemo and Tun Fun. The Van Gogh musuem has a wonderful free pamphlet for kids - searching for art, puzzles, etc. 5 days was not enough for us.

The location was perfect - a short walk from the train station - and convenient to water or bus transportation. It was unique, which we both loved.We would love to stay here again!!

<Content>Great Location Great Location: Husband  I went for a long weekend break. The location of the Botel is great. Get off the plane, hop on a train  then walk the short distance to the Botel - perfect. Hubby had stayed there on two other occasions so hence the return trip to the Botel. Its very near the red-light district and a very short distance to the main area where you can pick up the canal tour boats. There are fab restaurants very nearby, so I can't comment on the food at the Botel as we did not eat there. Though we did have a few nightcaps in the bar - again fine.The rooms are not hugh, we got on ok and we are both big people (width  height). Its a boat at the end of the day, so some head ducking for tall people is required. Yep, ok the showers are small, but it did the job. We used the Botel as a base for our sightseeing, it therefore met with out criteria. It was clean, very warm and we did not notice the noise from other rooms - guess it was due to the constant exercise through sightseeing, excellant food  fresh air. We will be using it again.

<Content>Avoid this hotel !! We stayed in this Hotel last week. We had two rooms one double and one triple. The double room had a dirty toilet filled with **** , honestly !!. The triple room had a single bed and two bunk beds leaving very small room to unpack luggages etc etc. The rooms are very small , the walls are very thin any being very close to the central station , trains are heard all the time !!. Breakfast was decent , staff not so friendly tough eg: barman didnt want to make us a cup of hot water. Avoid it .

<Content>Right next to Dam Square If your looking for a central, clean, bright and reasonbly priced accomodation, this is the one for you. The Botel is simple, spotless and right on the door step of everything. I went in October of this year and all 8 of us had a fantastic time, and we are all in our 40,s and 50,s. We paid 拢62.00 per night but that was sharing, so we each paid 拢31.00 per night, which I think is pretty reasonable.If 8 women between the ages of 40 and 50 can enjoy it, then everyone will. Enjoy your break !

<Content>Nothing special  We got to this hotel after travelling from Brussels. To our surprise they had no water supply so we had to wait till the evening to take a shower. We were put in a 3rd floor room which was ok but we had the view at the back of the boat, this consisted of overflowing drainage  construction work. The breakfast was really basic  nothing special. Luckily for us, we asked for a room change  got it. A strange thing happened while we were changing rooms. My partner left a bag in the room  i left a cleanser. When we realised, we enquired at the reception  she told that nothing was left in the room. Bet the cleansers really enjoyed my $60 cleanser! The rooms are really small  compact, not to mention the showers!! I wouldnt recommended to anyone. Its not worth the money, staying in a hostel would be less costly and you'll get the same thing!

<Content>Basic but central for sight seeing. Good fun! I stayed at the Amstel Botel for 3 nights with my partner recently. The Botel is basic but we found it clean and very central for the Centraal Station and sight seeing in Amsterdam. Not the kind of hotel you would want to spend too much time in but then who does when you're on a short break in a European city. Rooms are very basic, bathrooms are a bit too small to manage comfortably but ok for the neccesities. Fab if you want to get a cheap flight, catch the train from Schiphol airport to centraal station, Amsterdam for 3 euros and walk to the Botel. You can get the tram or bus right outside centraal station really cheap. Probably best suited for students and young people on a budget although there were a mix of people staying there at the same time as us. A fab city to visit. The destination should be the priority!

<Content>Clean  Just got back from the Botel after a 3 night stay. We stayed there before almost 4 years ago and enjoyed it, and it was better than I remembered! It appears to have been turned round 180 degrees (I don't think I'm imagining it, I don't even touch the dope :-) and the person who said it doesn't float - explain that then!!) Anyway, the metal walkway is a new addition because of this and is one gripe I have. We paid extra for a canal view room, and were put on the first floor, which would have been fine apart from the fact we couldn't see (or hear) anything but the walkway, so what a rip-off that was! Was looking forward to the view we had last time, especially at night. They shouldn't advertise the first floor rooms as canal view. Apart from that, the place is spotless, beds are very comfortable and the shower is powerful and plenty of hot water. Yes the walls are very thin and we did have our very own live sex show (well the audio version) at 2am, but they got a nice waking up from our alarm at 8am so think we were quits :-) Don't expect peace and quiet! The bar was great for a couple of drinks when you get back if you're early, maybe it could shut a little later (closes 12.45am) but then again it would be even noisier wouldn't it. If you're bothered by the 5-10 minutes into town, catch the tram (you can buy a 48 hour ticket for 10 euros which is good if you plan to do loads of sightseeing) All in all, pretty good value and would use it again.

<Content>no consideration I found the hotel to be very average with some problems that need to be considered before you book the hotel.1 You have to pay up front even before you see your room then try to get anything changed or attended to, you will find it hard.2 Hope you get good neighbours who will have consideration for other people when they return to the hotel in the early hours of the morning. The walls are so thin and flexable they do not kill any noise. Again when you complain you get negative feedback and very little help.3 The bathrooms are all in need of very big facelift. They are moldy and smell unpleasant. I don,t think I would stay at the Botel if I returned to Amsterdam and I would say you should consider very carefully if it is the sort of hotel you want. All I would say it would suit a stag or hen party then they could make all the noise they want and everyone would be in the same boat (pardon the pun)

<Content>Quirky, yet needs a facelift Came here for my Girlfriends Birthday on a city break.Enjoyed the location - easy walking distance to Amsterdam's interesting nightlife.Yes the rooms are small and could do with a facelift, but they are clean  tidy and the free in-room porn channel was an unexpected bonus!Can recommend the floating Chinese next door to the Botel - fantastic food and views.Overall, good cheap(ish) accomodation in a wonderful city that is a change from the usual hotel one might stay in.

<Content>Great value for money We stayed here for 2 nights in September it was my first time in Amsterdam and after reading all of the reviews I did not know what to expect. We found the Amstel a great location, very clean, which I think is one of the most important things and great value for money. The staff were very helpful. We would not hesitate to stay here again. We did not have any complaints at all.

Clean, quiet in the evening, comfortable with a central location. Reasonable sized rooms and baths for the cost. Very helpful staff. Excellent facility in it's target market.

<Content>Great Value This hotel is fantastic to explore the city you are very close to the Red Light District. The hotel is very clean and despite previous reviews i have read i could smell no dope at all. Also i found the staff very helpful and always eager to order a pizza in for you. The rooms are average for this price of hotel but are clean and well presented, yes the bathroom is small but your on holiday you don't need to spend hours in there! Breakfast was good value and with it lasting until 10:30 you don't need to rush to get up. I personally thought the beer and bar prices were expensive much cheaper to go to the supermarket.I will definatley stay here again.

<Content>The Amstel Botel-a good introduction to Amsterdam. My wife and I have stayed at the Amstel Botel for the past 3 years in a row. Our latest visit was last early March,during the blizzard. Apart from having to haul our luggage(4 heavy bags)through the snow from the train station to the botel,we had a ball.We found the rooms although tiny, clean and the bed was very comfortable. We have always stayed on the 2nd or 3rd floor overlooking the canal. The view of the city,particularly at night was wonderful. Yes the walls are thin and the aroma of pot is always present(this is after all Amsterdam). These minor irritations have never preventing us from enjoying the atmosphere. Buffet breakfast(all you can eat) was fine, and we found front desk staff and the mgr. owner himself to be very friendly and polite as was the night desk man.We could stay in a 4 star hotel if we wanted to,but we find the Amstel Botel to be a great introduction to this fabulous city. The bar is also quite adequate but on the expensive side. Should we return to Amsterdam and we probably will,we will no doubt stay at the Amstel Botel again.

Very clean. asked for a non smoking and it really was a non smoking, smelled great.You have your own bathroom with a kick-ass shower. Location is awesome. Free porn! Bar in house with restaurant. Now for the negatives. Staff is not all that friendly, they were never rude it was just that they were not there to make your stay just a little more enjoyable with say even a smile or a good morning that would have been nice. The first floor should not have rooms on it due to the fact that above oh say...room 128 the bar is there and the floors are very thin and you feel and hear everyone bound for the bar or the restaurant or their 2nd floor room walking. very loud. Also we faced towards the city which is located next to the the boardwalk to the hotel and the chinese place and a 1000 other shortcuts and it is very LOUD. whats that you say? Close your window, well cannot since no airconditioning so all I am saying is that it is loud. Also on the first floor people walking by get a straight shot into the room this of course made it hard to enjoy the porn. Curtains were the type that were just about 4 inches to small so always some spot open. and the hotel is nice enough to put a bench for people to sit on right outside the door which puts it outside our window and we were lucky to get every young Brit in town drunk and loud and telling of all his conquests in the red light district which sort of made up for the porn intrusion. BOTTOM line good hotel, great price. My wife and I would stay again just ask for a room up high and on the back side where the construction is taking place.

<Content>Good value, good location Although I am a frequent visitor to Amsterdam I normally stay in a BB more in town.However this was my wife's first trip to the city so I wanted something a bit different. Some friends of mine had previously stayed in the Botel and said it was O.K. however I did have some reservations after reading mixed reviews.I knew the hotel was in a good location being just a stones throw away from centraal station. So after researching a few booking websites (hotels.nl was by far the best deal) I took the plunge. First and formost you must try and get a canal view room which we had.But the problem was it was on the 1st (lower) floor looking at the walkway outside which was a little disappointing as it spoiled the view, but it was still better than looking at the building site and railway on the other side.Our room was a nice size considering this was a boat and the bed was queen size too and very comfortable. And yes, the toilet/shower room is very tiny. If you are 6ft 3ins like me it is a awkward. I was nearly breaking my ribs as I sat on the loo as the sink overlaps the toilet pan!!!! The shower itself was good and powerful. Indeed, the walls are on the thin side and for one night only we had a group of students next door that stayed up chatting and laughing until 4 in the morning.The restuarant was very nice with a good breakfast selection in the morning. The bar and lounge area was quite cosy as well, with pool table,internet access, juke box, pinball table and T.V.My only (and other guests) grumble was it closed too early.I found all the staff most helpful and pleasant.I do have just one other grumble which has been mentioned by other reviewers and that's the smell of dope that often drifts around the corridors especially when you return to the hotel from a night out. Personally I can't stand the stench and I feel the management should stamp it out. Smoking dope should be confined to the coffee bars and other bars of the red light district.On the whole we had a very pleasant stay.The hotel is in a great location and we found it offered very good value for money. We would definately stay here again.

<Content>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW 1)IT IS NOT A FLOATING HOTEL. It is a concrete slab designed to look like a hotel. 2) CONSTRUCTION ZONE ON THE NORTH SIDE. The entire north side of the hotel faces an empty land site. A huge multi building development commences shortly, which will take years to complete. 3)SOUTHSIDE WALKWAY. The entire southside of the hotel is embraced by a popular  well used metal walkway. Hotel guests, patrons of the next door floating Chinese restaurant or the nearby 11th floor discotheque all use this walkway. Don't expect any privacy, as everyone using the walkway can see into every room of the Botel. 4) ROOMS ARE TINY. Test the friendship of your travelling companion with the size of the rooms. Your cleanliness skills, or creating a mess skills will be apparent when you stay at the Botel. 5)BATHROOM. The clear winner of the planets smallest shower competition. If you are over 1.53 cm (5foot 3) and/or over 70 kg (11stone) , you won't fit into the shower! 6) BREAKFAST. Basic, but good. 7) STAFF. Other reviews have mentioned how bad the staff are. However, I found the staff to be friendly, helfpul and courteous. 8) LOCATION. An unbeatable location, being within easy walking distance from Centraal Station and the city itself. If your room is located on the southside, the view is great ( despite the lack of privacy issue.

<Content>great base to explore amsterdam stayed at the amstel botel 14/16 may2005,i was with a group of ten (five couples)we arrived early sat morning and was checked in by friendly staff,although our rooms would not be ready until 2.00pm we could leave luggage in reception.we headed to amsterdam and was advised to collect room keys after 2.00pm.the accomadation was of good quality,bed,tv,bathroom some of our party did moan about the small bathroom but it is a boat so what do you expect.the breakfast was buffet style,bacon sauages,boiled eggs,croissants,toast,ham cheese etc.and it was served until 10.30 which was good if you have been out all night.i found the bed really comfy and would go back again,wasnt too bothered about a dockside view as i only slept in the room,the tv did show free porn if thats your cup of tea?had a brilliant time and would advise anyone to book here .

<Content>clean, cheap accomodation Amsterdam is expensive. this is a cheap, well located option. do not expect huge amounts of room though. it is clean and has a good bar . the staff are helpful. the interent connection was broken whilst i was there which was a bit annoying. we had a room on the train side, which was a bit noisy. i would ask for the water side. not bad for location -right near central station, and price.

<Content>Great, Handy We have now stayed in the Botel in Amsterdam during 2005 and 2004. When went as a group the first time there was 16 of us and the second time 14, consisting of both male and females. We found the staff very helpful especially the night clerk, an older indian man who has worked there for over 20 years. The rooms are small and basic but clean and our room was cleaned every day and fresh towels put in the shower room. Admittedly the shower room is small but your only requiring it to wash. The breakfasts were excellent and we didnt have to pay extra for them and it was eat as much as you like from a wide selection of hot and cold foods. Admittedly the bar does close early but most people are not there to spent their nights on the boat. The Botel is central and very handy to everything would thoroughly recommend it and if we ever go back will defintely stay there again.

<Content>so so Very average as far as a hotel itself goes.... The biggest upset was the grungy TINY bathrooms (I've seen larger porta-potties). The bathroom starts to really stink when you shower, not suprising since the toilet is basically in the shower). If you can get past this, the hotel is OK for the price. We thought we'd stay there cause it seemed unique, it wasn't really any cheaper than anything else we looked at, though... If you want something more safe and clean don't stay here... you can find a hundred other comparable hotels for the same price.The location is about a block away from central station.. very convenient as far as that goes. its not convenient if you want to walk outside and go to a bar or something, everything will be a 4 block walk...

<Content>amsterdam continues to be a great place From Jim, Dundee, Scotland.Visited Amsterdam again from 13-16 April 2005, and stayed at the Botel which is approximately 3-4 minutes walk from Centraal Railway Station.This is a good and very clean floating tourist hotel and with its central location you can access all the major attractions by tram or by foot .The Botel does not take children. The free channels on the Satelite TV will probably explain why, but then again individuals have the option to watch or turn off. Anyway Amsterdam is so vibrant most people only want to use their rooms for crashing out in after the excesses of the day and night and only the extremely sad would want to stay in and watch TV.The cafe bars are something else and the general atmosphere in the city is one of being totally chilled out. Restaurants are freely available to suit any price range. My personal favourite is the Ankara, a good quality Turkish Restaurant with excellent food at very reasonable prices.My wife and I have visited Amsterdam 6 times in the past 5 years and will doubtless return next year.

<Content>Basic and it is Walk into the Boatel and you are immediately hit with the fragrant whiff of a certain notorious herb. O.K. this is Amsterdam but despite an 'official' policy of discouraging weed-use, in practice, it seems to be well-tolerated. This raises several issues. First if you are remotely asthmatic avoid this place like the plague. Secondly, if you dont like the smell of cannabis/tobacco smoke pervading your clothing, then avoid as well (unless you have written confirmation of a non-smoking room). There are some non-smoking rooms but even then past-guests seem to treat this as advice rather than instruction. Booking a room here is really Byzantine as well and this almost guarantees an argument upon check-in, so bring copies of every scrap of correspondence or email, and if you ring, the name, date and time of conversation. The rooms are basic but adequate but the showers have an alarming tendency to go from scolding to ice cold at will. The cleaners, no doubt used to airing rooms well, have a tendency to leave windows wide open in -2 Celsius temperatures while the central heating is simply not up to the job. I know this sounds negative but on the positive side, the river view rooms have a superb aspect (insist of this or otherwise you will enjoy a wonderful view of a railway track and all-night trains to soothe you to sleep). It is also brilliantly placed for Central Station and at 84 euros per-night (what we paid) for a non-smoking room and a hearty breakfast, you can put up with paper thin sound-proofing and the proclivities of your fellow guests.

<Content>Great location and generally great hotel I felt I needed to write something because of all the strange, bad reviews this place has got. I've stayed there a few times and am about to go back there for a 3 night stay on Saturday - hence me looking at recent reviewsFor what you pay, the Botel is great. The rooms aren't massive and the bathroom is quite small but everything is clean and tidy and the novelty of staying on a boat cannot be underestimated. You MUST stay on the canal side of the boat. There's nothing wrong with the harbour side but to open your curtains each morning to see and hear the water is brilliant. Not to mention that fact that you can look over the city; especially great if it's a weekday and you can watch people hurrying off to work before you take the short walk into the city centre for a nice smoke. Speaking of which they don't 'allow' you to smoke weed in the rooms but they don't do anything to stop you either.All in all, a great hotel and really friendly staff. Clean rooms and very good value fo rmoney.While sometimes people may get bad service off a member of staff who may have had a bad day or maybe a mistake is made and a room isn鈥檛 cleaned, 99% of the time the place is great 鈥?go and see for yourselves. You won鈥檛 regret it.I will post again when I get home after Tuesday.

<Content>Great for the price! Yes the rooms are TINY, the bathrooms are MINISCULE and the rooms do smell a bit smokey! But I found the Botel to be generally clean, friendly and in a great location! If you are expecting a huge, airy hotel room you will be disappointed but if you just want somewhere to shower and sleep, right in the heart of Amsterdam, then this is ideal! I don't understand the reviewers who said it was too far out of the centre! Perhaps they would rather stay right in the Liedsplein with all the noise and tacky pubs?? I have been to Amsterdam several times and I consider the city centre perimeters to stretch at least as far as the Botel! You can walk anywhere in the city from here. The nearest pubs and restaurants are perhaps 2 minutes away, with the red light district a bit further. If you are flying to Amsterdam, get on the train from the airport, get off at Centraal Station and after 5 minutes walk you are at the Botel!One thing though - we paid extra for a canal view but our window was right above the metal walkway which leads to reception. This was pretty noisy when anyone with heels clattered past so I would stay on the other side if I went back again! You can pay extra for the breakfast, and although it's a good spread, you can eat better for less if you go to one of the cafes on the way into town.

<Content>About what you'd expect I was happy with the desk people and satisfied with the room. Coming back late at night can be a bit indimidating due to the long, relatively isolated walk to the pier thingy. My only complaint was with the microscopic restroom, in which one has to virtually squat sideways under the sink in order to use the toilet. The shower was quite rusted, and the tiny bathroom quickly turns to a sauna when showering. But after all, this IS an old converted cruise ship of some sort. I was a bit surprised to turn on the TV and find XXX porn playing 24 hours a day, but I suppose that could be a bonus. Might not want to leave the kids unattended, though, if you're the sort that brings children to Amsterdam.

<Content>Small but nice Stayed at the Botel Nov 21 thru 28, yes room was small and bathroom was smaller but it was clean and the staff was friendly, rooms were cleaned almost everyday but then we slept till noon everyday, the Botel is centraly located and close to Central Station (2 block walk), arrived at 7am and room wasn't available but they checked our luggage and told us to come back anytime after 2pm, that was fine, it gave us the morning to explore, I would recommend the Botel to anyone and would stay and will stay there again on my next trip.

<Content>botel : Enjoyed the stay Hotel was clean and tidy as was our room. Bathroom was a little small but it is a boat remember. We could feed the ducks from the window, and there is a free telly in each room.All in all we had a good stay and would book again. Breakfast was bacon and sausage sandwiches and various rolls cheese etc.. .The botel is just a short walk away from the station and nightlife. There is building work going on behind the botel which did not effect us as we were at the front. JOHN

<Content>We really liked the botel, clean, friendly and excellent value for money Hi, My girlfriend and I have just arrived back from a long weekend in Amsterdam. We had an excellent time which was compounded by two things, firstly the Amstel Botel and secondly the weather!We chose the Botel because I had stayed there 7 years ago when I visited A'dam with a friend. I couldn't remember much about it other than there was nothing bad about the place which is the sort of thing you don't forget too quickly. After a disgusting stay at The ACCA Hotel in February 2004 (don't go there whatever you do) we wanted to stay somewhere clean, friendly and close to the action. I decided the Botel was the place for us and what a great decision I made. The place was welcoming, friendly, clean and tidy. We received excellent service from all the staff, the breakfast was good, the room was very clean and bedding and towels were changed daily if you hung the cleaning card on your door, if you don't do that you probably won't get clean sheets etc which possibly explains a few of the bad reviews about the Botel. There was no major noise to report and the bathroom though small was exceptionally clean. The bed was comfy enough for three nights and the view over the canal was fantastic to say the least. We were on the top floor which made everything just perfect as when the sun shines over the canal the view is lovely. The rooms are small but what do people really expect, if you want the Mariott then pay for it. I knew from the moment we walked in and my girlfriend gave it the seal of approval saying I really like it, its great that everything was gonna be fine. That coming from anyone is not a really bold statement I suppose but as she is a Reservations Supervisor for a very large and expensive 4 star UK Hotel Group I think it says a helluva lot for the Botel. All in all we couldn't really fault the place, I would, without exception, recommend it to anyone. We were very, very happy and completely enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Value for money I stayed at the Botel on friends' recommendations. It is a couple of minutes walk from the train station and close enough to all the action. Rooms were basic and the bathroom was very small. However,I would recommend that you stay here, as rooms where clean and breakfast was good. I too had a room that overlooked a building site, but I regard a room as somewhere to sleep and hang my clothes....I go on a city break to explore the city, and not take stock of my room!I would recommend that you go the floating chinese restaurant next door. food was excellent and again, good value. i went there to celebrate my birthday and was not dissappointed.

<Content>Blitzed on the Botel. Found the Botel very convenient for all the main sites and attractions. Rooms were basic but clean. Had no problems whatsoever with the staff, in fact hardly saw any staff. In house movies were easily accessed ( Channel 35 in our room) and certainly set you up for the attractions. Breakfast was more than adequate ( eat and drink as much as you like)- we didn`t pay supplements for anything. All in all a basic , clean base if you are staying a hazy couple of days in Amsterdam.

<Content>The biggest rip of Amsterdam A friend and I decided to take a few days in Amsterdam, so after checking out some guidebook reviews, I booked us at the Amstel Botel for 2 nights. The pictures made it look really nice and clean - but we were to find out otherwise. After trying to check in, an ordeal in which the concierge accused me of credit card fraud repeatedly, which entailed my having to walk back up to centraal station to use the ATM and pay for the room in cash, we were given our keys.The room didn't look terrible at first glance - just a bit small. Then we noticed the holes in the curtains, the stains on the walls, the dank, unclean little bathroom with a very suspicious shower, and stains all over our towels!!We wanted to take a nap, but the sheets looked like they hadn't been changed and as though one could catch lice from them, and the bedspreads were cheap and scratchy.We also noticed on our first evening that people were looking through the windows and seeing everything we were doing! Our first breakfast buffet there proved to be disgusting, with just cold cuts and some old looking cheese, and having to pay an absurd amount for any extra beverage, like juice. The staff, for the duration of the trip, was exceptionally rude to us, and refused to answer any questions. This is not including, however, the night clerk, an older Indian man, who was VERY friendly and helpful - the only nice person working at the Botel!As for safety : My friend and I went out late at night and came back late at night, and were always wary of what we called, The Rape Trail - the long, isolated metal pathway along the side of the Botel (a note to girls staying alone : be very careful around this area, we were approached many times by creepy older men around the entrance to the botel's pier thing)On the upside, the botel itself had good security. We had to use our keys to open the hotel doors after a certain hour, and when I brought a friend back into my room, the very nice night clerk politely told him that only Botel guests were allowed into the hotelAs for the view : the back side of the ship faced a massive industrial site with a garbage truck, where they are construction the Ode to Amsterdam, and a pungent aroma rose over the whole hotel - not to mention the strange noises that began at around 8am and woke us upWhile the botel is easy to get to and find, it is somewhat removed from the center of town, so if you want to check out nightlife, it's definitely not a good place to stayone more thing : never saw any sign of the free in -house movies so proudly advertised on the side of the BotelAll in all - I would NOT reccomend the Botel - there are much cleaner facilities for what you pay for, and the charm of staying on a boat is massively overshadowed by how dirty the hotel is, and how rude it's (daytime) staff is

<Content>Staff was helpful Our overnight flight from the US arrived in Amsterdam at 5 am, so we arrived at the Botel before 7 am, fully expecting to have to stash our luggage and wander about in a daze until the 2 pm check-in time. So we were surprised and delighted that the staff let us have our room at 7 am........a first in my experience.As others have mentioned, the rooms are small (but so are a lot of European hotel rooms-- get used to it.) They are very clean, and I never had any noise problems from my neighbors.The canal-side rooms do have a better view, but cost more. They also expose you to the noise of everyone walking on the dock that runs alongside the boat. The land-side rooms face a huge consruction project that looks like it will go on for a few years.All in all, I was happy with our stay. Very good location; just walk out of the Centraal Station, turn left, walk two blocks, and you will see the boat.

<Content>The Botel is Good!! I went to Amsterdam twice and stayed at the Botel once. I am thinking of going back again and I will choose to stay at the Botel again. The other hotel I stayed at - I had to carry my luggage (a lot) up the stairs into the hotel (it was a 3 or 4 star hotel) myself. No one helped. At least at the Botel there was a ramp to take your luggage up. It is a busy place but very friendly and you cannot beat the location. Right by the train station and across the street from a coffee shop. Everyone was friendly and I fed seagulls french fries from my window. It has atmosphere!! Can't wait to go back again. The price was right. Although the rooms are small - they are clean and do-able. I am not a kid - 57 - but I like this place!

<Content>Pay more for the water view! Well, it fails to match up to what I would call a 3-star hotel, but I guess all over europe the star rating system is a little off from what we have here in the USA. If you're looking at hostels, put this one in the mix. It is priced accordingly, too, as it is cheaper than many hostels available in Amsterdam. You definitley get what you pay for here.The rooms were very clean, and I found the staff to be quite friendly. No service problems or anything like that. The internet in the hotel has its on and off moments. There's a convenient cigarette vending machine and soda machine that accept only coin fare. The bar sells candy, and after hours, the reception desk takes on the candy selling responsibilities.The rooms were very tiny, and the bathroom was the bare minimum in size. Queen beds are really just 2 twins pushed together. There is a hard space in between. Couples are actually better just opting for the twin beds cause you get what seems to be a little more room and a center little tabletop area. Really, romance isn't one of the qualities Botel has to offer. The beds, however, are pretty comfortable. There is a desk and small closet with a safe as well. Television has the basics, including MTV, and 24 hour dutch porn (just channels away from the cartoon stations during the morning and afternoon-so watch out for your kids).We had the non-water view, which was one of the loudest and least comforting views I've ever experienced from a hotel room. The noise of the trains arriving and departing from very nearby Central Station combined with the sound of shoveling and huge construction machinery becomes almost unbearable by 2:00AM, and from what I understand, the sound isn't much more muffled from the front of Botel. However, the view is 200% better when facing the water. This cannot be stressed more.Added to the sound of construction and trains are the sounds of the other guests in the nearby rooms. The walls are paper thin and one can make out quite clearly the conversations of neighbors. Be advised.The location was great. Close to central station (literally next door), and a 10 minute walk to Dam Square.Basic jist - If you're a light sleeper, don't stay here. If you're looking for a decent clean, and semi-comfortable room in a good location at a good price, and don't mind the squeaks, rumbles, and bangs going throughout the evening, shaking you in your bed, this place is totally cool. Luxury it is not. I will not stay here again, but don't necessarily regret the money we saved, as we put that into a really nice hotel in the end of the trip.Also, there is a clearly marked no marijuana smoking sign on the rule manual in the room. I don't think this is strictly enforced, but be cautious for those of you who want to take something back to the room from the coffeeshops.

<Content>Basic, overpriced and noisy neighbours! Very basic hotel, which was fine by us, but we thought it was way over priced. The bathroom is very small. There are lovely views from the front of the boat, but if you are at the back of the boat beware! There is a train line and some building work going on. By the looks of it the building work will be going on for awhile and the equipment they are using is quite loud.

<Content>It's all about the location Amstel Botel is nothing special. But I was happy I stayed there because it was right next to Central Station in Amsterdam. After a long flight, we were fighting jet lag. It was also our first time in Europe, so we really needed a place like this that was so easy to find. Believe me, after a long flight, the last thing you need is the stress of trying to find your way around the streets or figure out the public transportation system. Take a nap first! Not only was the Botel right outside the station, if we were ever lost trying to find our way home, we could just ask people for directions to the station. If you've been to Amsterdam before or you think you'll have no problem finding your way around, there are plenty of other cheaper, more comfortable places to stay. But if you're a first-timer like me, I highly recommend the Botel for the first couple of days until you get your bearings.

<Content>Good Value for money Stayed here with friends August 2003 and found it to be ideal for the budget-minded. Location is good - you can see it from the entrance to Central Station, no need for taxi. 5 minute walk to centre of Amsterdam. Lets face it, we didnt come to Amsterdam to spend more time in our room, so if what youre looking for is a cheap, convenient roof over your head, then I think the Botel is great, if youre after the Hilton then go spend lots more money elsewhere. Would stay here again.

<Content>Can't beat it for the price Have stayed at the Botel on 8 or 9 occasions and I have no complaints.The rooms are basic, there is no doubt, but they are very clean, the towels are changed daily, the radiators work, the view from the canal-side rooms is fabulous and the showers are good.I have been to Amsterdam about 13 times and most of them have been spent on the Botel. For the price, I have yet to find better value in Amsterdam.

<Content>Will go again... The Botel is ok. Just that - ok. The place is just very, well, average. You may be able to find better hotels, but I did enjoy the Botel. The staff are really nice (apart from the chef - seems a little rude) The rooms are small, but have everything you need, and the views from the water side are fantastic. The price is good value for money, and the location (for some) is perfect - not to central, but central enough, so you can acctually get to sleep at night! Things could be improved upon (e.g, coffee/tea making facilitys in room, more vending machines etc..) But you really do get what you pay for. One thing I did like, is that they clean your room quite late, so you can have a lie in! Basically, I stayed there for the novelty factor of staying on a boat, try it, but It may not meet all your needs.

<Content>Good Budget Hotel My boyfriend and I have stayed in this hotel 4 times now and we are going back on April 29th for Queens day weekend. We have found no problems with this hotel. We last stayed on New Years Week and found the room very warm! We had to open the windows at night even though it was freezing and snowing outside. We found hotel to be clean and cheap and it had everything we needed.Steph

<Content>disapointed we booked the botel in november 2003 for a romantic valentine weekend and were very disapointed when we arrived as they had double booked our room so instead of a luxury double room we recieved a basic twin and only a 20 euro discount on the room for our trouble it didnt go down too well however the botel is very central but so are a lot of other cheaper hotels all providing a double bed which we found out the next day but by then were already charged for our 4 night stay so under normal circumstances the botel would have been fine but we felt robbed

<Content>Apalling service Absoloutly apalling service, having booked a 2 night stay over easter giving all of my details including credit card details, I was sent an e.mail the next day saying your reservation has been cancelled because you have to stay for 4 days over that weekend, however there was no mention of this as I booked, When I called them I found the staff to be extremely rude and unhelpful, it now means I have to search for hotels all over again which is very frustrating, I have already booked the flights and I may now lose out on them as I have nowhere to stay. I would never recomend this place to anyone as I would not like to line the pockets of the ignorant staff who work there. AVOID

<Content>9th feb 2004 I found the botel to be basic, and the rooms to be small, we didn't expect much for being on a boat, it had everything we needed, the sea view was great and it was very central. We have had one of the most enjoyable weekends and we would go back to the botel without a doubt. The only thing that annoyed us was false advertising. I booked this from the internet and it did say that breakfast was incluced. We had to pay an extra 8 euros each. Apart from that we had no faults and the staff were very helpful.

<Content>Another Nice Stay My second say at the Botel and once again, it was a great place to call home for my stay in A-Dam. Comfortable, clean and friendly, it's location is great. With the new canal-side entrance, be sure you get a room on the the 3rd floor or above, otherwise people will be peering into your room. And as a tip, try to get a room PAST the hotel's entrance, so you'll be less disturbed by late-night returning guests walking on the dock.

<Content>Had everything we needed. The botel was in view when we came out of centraal station, which was a relief as it was freezing when we arrived. Was just a couple of minutes walk. Loved it from the moment we entered. Was warm  cosy and the reception staff were welcoming. The room was basic but had everything we needed for a comfortable weekend stay - bathroom, double bed, wardrobe, tv, alarm clock  heating. We had a canal side room on the bottom level so had ducks outside our window. The free 24 hour porn chanels are pretty hard core so you'll glad to see people with clothes on by the end of your stay! The self service buffet breakfast was nice  there was plenty of selection. The bar was a bit poor though. It did us to get a quick drink to warm us up when we came in but that was about it. If I go back to amstedam I would stay in the botel again.

<Content>"Cheap 'n Cheerful" I stayed in the amstel botel in august'03. I found it to be an enjoyable stay. Yes it is basic, with the lingering smell of smoke ever present. The breakfast was nice and the room was cleaned on a daily basis. The view was beautiful and the location is great. Its very accessible, located not far from the city central, but further enough away from the red light district. The only fault I found with this hotel was that although a maid cleaned daily, there was a constant smell of urine coming from out of our bathroom and the room was never hoovered, only swepted, so you had some parts of the room very dusty. I would definitely stay her again, and prefered the location as many other hotels were too central and lacked privacy.

<Content>Fab Weekend When we arrived at Central Station, it was a wonderful relief to see Amstel Botel in the distance!... not having to worry about further transport, just 5 mins. walk. We all felt that we would enjoy our stay.... and so we did! We loved the spacious room which we stayed in... nice and clean and the reception staff were very helpful and friendly too. It was like a mini home, beautiful views all around. Couldn't complain, will definitely stay again and again and again..... Caroline, Carlos and Cherry x Thank U Hotel Botel - we really enjoyed our stay! 8/08/2003 to 11/08/03

<Content>Trying to give a fair review of the Amstel Botel Have just spent 7 nights at the Amstel Botel. If I'd read some of the reviews posted here before I went I probably wouldn't have gone. The Botel was fine. Very basic. The rooms are quite small - I kept banging my knees on the wood surrounding the bed! The bathroom is exceptionally small and the shower smaller still. There were no tea/coffee making facilities and no fridge in the room. For cleanliness, it was very good. The room was cleaned and the towels changed every day. I thought it was very expensive. 92 euros. But then again, it was the height of summer and also Amsterdam Pride week so the city was crowded. It was very convenient though. We caught a plane from the airport to Centraal Station and it was just a few minutes walk from the station - saving a fortune on a taxi. The bar was nice, although it got a bit smoky at times. The dining room was very bright and it was lovely to eat breakfast and look over the canal. Breakfast itself was very good. A cooked breakfast or continental style, served as a bufffet so you can eat as much as you want. We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. Our biggest complaint was that our room was at the back of the Botel and the sound of the trains nearly drove us mad. We had to sleep with the window shut which was awful as the weather was so hot. We did ask to move but it was full although the staff did try their best. They did say that no-one else had ever mentioned the noise. I found that a bit hard to believe. As well as the trains there was work going on at the back of the Botel. Huge girders were being put into the canal. Work started at 7.30am and the noise was horrific. Apart from the noise though, it wasn't too bad a place to stay, as it was so close to everything in the city.

While in Amsterdam I transferd to this botel because HOTEL ATLANTA was horrible!!!!!! Please dont view the bad ratings and change your mind. Just go yourself and you will see.And the hospitality was excellent! THANKS BOTEL STAFF!!!!

<Content>Rip off seaview I have stayed in the Botel a number of times over the last 7 years and found it to be basic but ok.However,I have just come back from there and was not happy about the so called sea viewThe new entrance to the Botel is accessed by way of a newly built pier/jetty which obscures the lovely sea views if you happen to be put on the lowest floor.So,be warned,if booking to stay there make sure your seaview room is at least on the second floor or higher otherwise you may find yourself gazing out on to a rusty old pier support or even worse the people walking along the pier can see what you are up to!

<Content>Loved the Botel Stayed at the Botel near Central Station in May. Was our sixth budget short break in Amsterdam and this was our favourite hotel so far. Small, simple but comfy room with very small bathroom but amazingly powerful shower. Friendly staff. adequate breakfast and a great view over the canal. Not noisy at all and slept well each night. The foundation of a fantastic stay. At under 拢60 per room per night we felt it was well worth it. GO!

<Content>smelly rooms, no hot choc but cool view! good value but a bit crap if you consider the smelly smokey rooms and the suspicious showers. The view from the room window is lovely though, over the Amstel, very romantic sunsets and sunrise... for breakfast, there's either coffee or tea only, personnally i need some creamy hot chocolate to start the day but there were none available, only as an extra, so i had to pay 5 euros extra on the 7euros all-inclusive buffet breakfast!!!Watch out for the boozy brittish slags around the bar/lounge, they can be messy with their beer..!

<Content>Fawlty Towers We were a group of four people attending a conference, we each had seperate rooms at 96 euro each. The rooms were fairly clean and the beds ok. The location is also quite good, close to the central station etc. My real problem with this hotel is apart from being unfriendly, the staff (exept from an elderly nightwatch) also treat their guests offensively and rude. It started as we checked in. -Their questions were orders, they never looked at you, and throughout our stay any question made you feel like interupting their privacy. Breakfast was supposed to be included, but they argued this, claiming 9 euro each. On my last day the breakfast(guard) told me that my room had breakfast included, I asked him to check twice, and he confirmed. Confronting the reception with this, the only reply was we will not pay your money back, I assured her that this was to be regarded as a notice for future reference, upon which the receptionist with a dissaproving grin turned back to her PC. I made my departure as swift as possible, dropping my keycard at the reception without a word, avoiding eye contact, a final small triumph on my behalf.

<Content>Stay away from this dump! Having made the mistake of staying at the Botel myself, I would encourage others to learn from my experience and avoid the Botel at all costs! The Botel is a converted ship -- it resembles a river steamboat -- located approximately 7 minutes from Centraal Station. The rooms are very small, and the bathrooms, still retaining their cabin dimensions, are miniscule. But the size of the room is not the problem. The biggest drawback to the Botel is that it is dirty. The carpets are stained and the bedspreads are gross. The rooms are disgusting and the aroma of smoke is ever-present. Additionally, the Botel is removed from the rest of Amsterdam. Although it's not far from Centraal Station, it is quite isolated on a canal across from the main post office. If you really are on a tight budget and don't mind a filthy room, I guess the Botel will work, but with as many hotel rooms as are available in Amsterdam, I strongly encourage everyone to choose more charming, clean, and well-located accommodations.

<Content>Happy Days Amstel Botel is the place to stay, with friendly staff and lovely views. After staying there with friends and having a super time I recomended it to my sister and her husband who also booked to stay. In October we are going back again with five friends and will definately be staying in the Botel aqgain.

<Content>Rooms Stink Of Cigarette Smoke If your not used to anything better then i suppose its a good value hotel close to all amenities but let me warn you because its less expensive than a lot of hotels it attracts the base element who dont care how much noise they make when they come in at three four or even five in the morning if its a good nights sleep youre after forget it. The bar would be quite a nice place to have a pre dinner drink exept it is thick with smoke. The rooms are not air conditioned and are hot and stuffy also mine stunk of cigarette smoke which no amount of fresh air could eradicate. The shower room is tiny and had a distinctly unpleasant smell. This hotel was recommended to us but i would not recommend it to anyone else.

<Content>Very adequate My wife and I have just returned from a short break in Amsterdam, and having stayed at the Botel we must say, that although it has its drawbacks (small bathroom and wafer thin walls) it is clean, tidy and apart from THAT barman, very welcoming.We would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone that is looking for no frills acommodation, well situated in Amsterdam.

<Content>Well Done!! Very good hotel. The staff very helpfull. I'll tell you why. On the way home from hotel my friend forgot his passport he left it in the hotel room. We was in the airport when he discovered this so we phoned the hotel to ask if they would send it in a taxi .no problem they said and within half hour it was at the information desk at the airport. They cared and that impresess me. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are comfortable breakfast is good too english style or continental. Great for the price will allways stay here when in Amsterdam!
