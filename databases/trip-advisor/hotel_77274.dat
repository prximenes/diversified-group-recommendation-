<Content>Excellent, except for... The room was fantastic. Great views, great location, spacious, and clean...only problem was that there was a colony of ants in the bathroom around the bottom of the sink. Out of the three rooms we had mine was the only one with ants so it looks like it's probably just the one room and after the maid cleaned the next morning they were all gone.The staff is excellent and the location can't be beat if you're looking to experience Hollywood.

<Content>Overall a fun stay if you'd like to be right in the action in tourist central I was in town for business. This was a good place to stay if you want to be right in the middle of the action on Hollywood Boulevard, and by action I mean being able to step outside your hotel and be accosted by Daffy Duck or Spiderman or Pocahontas etc. and have shops right at your door. The hotel is opposite The Chinese Theatre so also puts you somewhere easily reminiscable when watching films as you'll frequently see both the hotel and vicinity on tv and in films.There are a lot of bands and celebrities who stay here so this is another level of action that you may seek out.After getting the chance to drive around lots and see different areas I reckon next time I'll probably rent an apartment by the beach, I tend to prefer more low key quiet chilled places with walking potential, and if this strikes a similar chord this hotel may not be for you.Anyway, the hotel itself was made up of a gorgeous exterior and the same if somewhat dark interior, something I've noticed popular in celebrity haunts, 'all the better not to see you with my dear'.The pool is legendary, the rooms okay. Clean a modern take on the 70's but as they are somewhat small and as the mattress sat in the middle of a larger wooden platform I kept bashing my shins on the corners every time I would walk around it- I still have the scars, so this was somewhat annoying.Good desk, smallish window, dark bathroom with not much light, but all in all it was okay.Meals there very pricey, breakfast, oatmeal fruit and tea plus tip set me back over $45. I couldn't relax very well in the rooms though, and I still don't really know why, there was nothing really wrong with it, and a great walk in closet if you're staying there for a while as I was.Some say the hotel is haunted. Who knows.

<Content>Not a bad stay I stayed at the Roosevelt last week for a couple nights on a business trip. The hotel was in a terrific location and had tons of character. The rooms were small, but very warm and well appointed.My only caution on this hotel (especially if you get a good online rate) is all the add-on costs. Parking is vallet only at $28 and all the resturants are pretty pricy. Even packets of coffee in the room come at a cost. I ate most of my meals at nearby establishments; many just steps outside the hotel.

<Content>Disappointed w/ the Roosevelt I was looking forward to my stay at the Roosevelt for a business conference I was attending. The location on Hollywood Blvd., is ideal, with plenty going on around the hotel.The room they initially gave me had an interesting style -- an urban, efficiency apartment feel to it, as I walked through (intentionally) dimly lit hallways with carpeting that mimmicked a brick road. The room had a brick wall interior (still dimly lit-- by design), hardwood floors, and a pavement like (concrete?) floor in the bathroom. The problem was---------- the noise. There wasn't necessarily that much noise, but, because of the (extremely) poor soundproofing of the rooms, ... you could hear very clearly every detail of the conversations in the rooms next to you. It was as if you were sharing a cabin with people you didn't know. When I called the front desk, to ask to have my room changed... they 'played' naive about it, but, I sensed this was a common complaint with guests, in that they quickly ended the charade, and gave me a more conventional room in a different section of the building.That room was indeed quieter, but very, very small. Personally, I'm alright with that.When I opened the door, and walked into the new room, there were two staff members (not housecleaning) that had shocked looks on their faces (guilty looks). They immediately hung up the room phone, and bolted out of my room. I was kind of ticked, and called to make sure there were no charges against my room bill.Because there was limited shelf space and closet space, the housekeeping crew accidently knocked my shaving kit into the toilet when they were cleaning. Rather than fess up to it, they quietyly put it back in it's original location. That evening, when I got back to the room, I reached in, and noticed the thing was saturated with all of my toiletries wet., and items saturated.There was construction going on on the (street) lobby level, so guests needed to take the (only one operating) elevator down to the ground level, and hike back up a set steps to get outside.I know each of these issues sound minor and random, but, my general feeling is that for the price they charge per room, you should expect good customer service and attention to details. At a minimum, a reasonably quiet room would seem like a fair expectation.I wouldn't recommend the Roosevelt... not for the prices they charge. I'm probably going to try the Renaissance the next time I'm in the area. I don't expect everything to be perfect.. I just want a clean and quiet room to stay in, with minimal interruptions. I did not get that.

<Content>The Roosevelt Has It All Covered I had the pleasure staying at the Hollywood Roosevelt last month for a long weekend. I found that the hotel had all aspects of a hip and fun, yet luxurious hotel covered. Having an aversion to anything pretentious, being a fan of historic buildings and given the amentities within the hotel.... I was tempted to never leave. From the super comfortable bed and linens, Kiehls bath products - to the pool, restaurants and bars. Not to mention the helpful, attentive staff. The allure and ambiance of the lobby alone makes you want to stay!When I did leave, the location is unbeatable. Right on Hollywood Blvd with so much within walking distance or a short drive / taxi ride away. Kudos to staff and management for dialing it all in and creating a wonderful experience. I will definitely be returning to the Hollywood Roosevelt when I am in L.A.

<Content>Good location and staff, comfortable rooms Fantastic location -- right on walk of fame, catty-corner from the Chinese theatre, lots of shopping. Rooms are small but comfortable and well furnished. Staff very friendly and helpful (it is California afterall). Great burger bar on site -- lots of cool combos so you can still clog your atteries with even if you go with the turkey or veggie options. The atmosphere of the Roosevelt is a bit dark -- qualifies as cool in the evenings, but in the morning dim lighting and techno music is a bit out of place/jarring -- but that's only a minor issue. One random extra I loved -- instead of the usual USA Today outside your door in the morning, you get a NY Times. Just the thing for the coffee shop across the street from the hotel.

<Content>Location, Atmosphere, Service its all here Stayed 4 nights from Oct 4th. with 3 adult children and 1 teenager. Bathroom small and with no exhaust system became quite steamy but loved the Keihl products, water pressure great. Soft luxurious towels. Room had two amazingly comfortable queen beds with enough room for 3 of us ( other 2 had own room). 4th floor room 414, I think not much of a view, looked over rooftop, if we hadn't been quite so tired( had just flown in from Australia) we may have asked for better view but once we settled couldn't be bothered, although I'm sure they would have accommodated us. Not dark and dingy as made out in some reviews. Contemporary in design.Have read reviews of snooty staff this was not what we found at all. Check in was smooth, initially given room with only one bed but was rectified immediately. My children went to the bars in hotel, we brought various food and drink back and had no problem with security at any stage during our stay as other reviewers have complained about. A movie was being filmed one day of our stay with an enormous amount of equipment but this did not affect us at all. Concierge (Lauren I think) was helpful in organising Limo and with any questions we had.Lobby near main entrance is really old world Hollywood and just beautiful, yes it is dark but that is part of its charm.Location can't be beat right on Hollywood Blvd across from Graumans . Felt safe in this area at night as long as you don't go more than about 5 blocks down. Although my children didn't worry at all and even walked to Sunset at night.Probably not for young children or budget conscious but we loved it!

<Content>great location we chose the roosevelt for its location...directly opposite manns chinese theatre and a stone's throw from the metro. this was a great decision as we only had two days in LA  the hotel was well placed for all the local attractions.we booked directly with the hotel but on arrival ended up with one of the smallest rooms next to the elevators. after 4 hours we decided to ask for another room as the noise was unbearable. this posed no problems and we were promptly moved (luckily to a bigger room, away from the elevators).despite this mishap the hotel had a lot of character...it was very dark but this only added to it's appeal. we ate in 25 degrees...and had a tasty burger lunch (good value  service). room service was pricey - for breakfast we a ate at Mels diner round the corner opposite the metro (fab, retro place open 24 hrs). the hotel had some nice touches e.g. the kiehls products in the bathroom, a turn down service at night and little bottles of mms left on your pillow.the only other down side was the bathroom - small but perfectly formed. i'd stay here again - but only for a couple of nights

<Content>Loved the Roosevelt I loved staying at The Roosevelt! I loved the mediterranean tiles the hotel was decorated in. I really loved the old feel of this hotel.You cannot beat the location! Its on Hollywood Blvd right across from the Kodak  Chinese Theatres.Room was comfortable  I slept very well. The staff was very accomodating and pleasant.A lot of celebrities were walking around the hotel, and I thought that was very cool. No one was paying them any attention, as if it was very normal, which was very cool.

<Content>Good hotel, great location We are a couple in our twenties and were pleased with our choice of the Hollywood Roosevelt for a two-night visit. The location is perfect for exploring Hollywood as it's right opposite the Chinese Theatre.The rooms are very small, but nicely done. For a two night visit the room size wasn't a problem, but it might be an issue if you're planning a longer visit. The bathroom was lovely too with a good supply of products by 'Fresh'.The hotel itself is very dark, but that's part of its ambience. The reception was lovely and the concierge very helpful. We asked the concierge to book us tickets to The Police who were playing at the Bowl that evening - she sorted it all out for us while we went out sightseeing and our booking confirmation was under our door when we got in (although she did spend slighty more than we'd agreed).On our first evening at the hotel there was a pool party which looked fun, but a bit overwhelming after a long day travelling - it was packed full of local rich kids, with music from a live DJ. The pool area is lovely during the day, unfortunately we didn't have enough time to make the most of it.We ate in the restaurant once and found the service very impressive. The food was lovely although there was not a great choice for my boyfriend who is vegetarian. The breakfast place within the hotel is very good too. During our stay there was a limited lift service which was annoying as it meant a long wait each time, but I'm sure that was just temporary.Despite the hotel being rather pricey, its a great place to stay to be in the heart of things.

<Content>This is LA! Just what I thought LA would be like. This is a great looking hotel in a great location. Extremely friendly staff. The concierge was a bit too cool for school but helpful to an extent.Hire car was dealt with very well by reception, and free internet in the foyer made getting local info very easy.The room was nice. Not as big as a lot of American hotels but comfy. We only stayed for two nights and as our room was on the third floor on the same level as the flat roof, we were disturbed on both nights by people drinking on the roof until early in the morning. On the second night, a lady actually managed to enter our room! As easy going young guys this was not a major problem, but I can imagine other people having a big problem with this! Ask not to stay near the flat roof!The pool bar area was absolutely great though, and I think my favourite bar in Hollywood. Full of great looking people, great music, all set against a lit pool beneath the hotel sign. Looked very nice. Just sad I didn't drink there every night.Overall, a very nice hotel exlcuding the disturbances, very friendly beautiful smiley faces everywhere and a great spot to explore Hollywood and Beverly Hills.

<Content>Big let Down We arrived at the Hollywood Roosevelt as a newley wed couple after a four and a half hour journey from the beautiful friendly Ritz Carlton hotel at Lake Las Vegas. We walked into the hotel reception feeling like the Beverly Hillbillies, the staff at reception were cold and unfriendly although the receptionist did give us and upgrade to a cabana (Which he said was overlooking the gardens! and was really overlooking a multistorey carpark with a vine growing up the side of it)  The guy who took our bags to the room was friendly he gave us the ins and outs of the place. The hallways were dark, very dark, the cabana room was dark, not as chic as it looks on the website, even with the lights on you need a torch to see in your suitcase. The bathroom was about the same size as the wardrobe and the floor of the room wasnt very clean. All the furniture just looked cheap and tacky not great for the price! We ventured off for a drink (out of the hotel) and luckily we met a nice couple who was also staying in the Roosevelt, after a few drinks we all decided to head back to the Roosevelt and keep on drinking at the Tropicana bar which is at the poolside at the Roosevelt, I had this idea that it would be full of Hollywood glamour and lots of beautiful people but it wasn't. Everyone was dressed casually, very arrogant, rude and pretentious. The hotel was overrun with teenaged kids spending daddy's money.  We were made to feel like intruders everytime we wanted to go to our room as the tropicana security staff would stop us and ask us where we were going and check us off their list, even if you had a bottle of water you were asked to get rid of it (BUT IM JUST GOING TO MY ROOM FOR GODS SAKE!) Don't even bother to ask any of the staff about the history of the hotel, because they don't know. Just read it up before you go and educate them while your there. Also don't bother saying hello or smiling at the staff because they just look at you like your off your trolley.The room was noisey all night long, the walls must be paper thin. Loud music, car alarms, talking from the rooms nearby, dont even get me started on the airconditioning unit! Honestly I thought this hotel was going to be chic, sexy elegent, classy, brimming with Hollywood history and Glamour and it was totally the opposite, which is a big shame. The owners of the hotel seriously need to reconsider who they are contracting the leases of the bars to as they are making this hotel a very uncomfortable place to stay. This hotel could be a magic piece of old Hollywood if it was just managed properly. We left after two nights and I couldnt believe that while we were waiting for the car to be brought round for us to leave, the car valet guy told us which room Marilyn Monroe had lived in for two years and it was the room right across from ours. I'd asked the staff several times and no-one knew. I couldnt believe it i had walked past the room several times and the door had been open and I didnt get a proper look. :( Over all a complete let down.

<Content>Noisy Roosevelt The hotel is very nice albeit very dark. The room we were given was very small and as the furniture is all brown it looked even smaller. After a couple of hours in the room I felt myself gettin agitated and couldnt stand being there anymore. The hotel staff were very good and changed our room to a larger one. I was very happy until the pool bar started playing their music and then sleep was out of the question until 2am when it ended. On the 3rd night we decided to go to the pool bar and have a drink and see what it was all about, my husband was then told that he had to change his clothes, he was dressed very smarlty in shorts and shirt but as it was yet another private party it wasn't good enough for them. Looking around we noticed that most men were dressed in scruffy jeans and t-shirts but that was ok. Again the noice went on until 2am and then drunken shouts and cars honking for another hour. on our 4th and last night all was quiet and we thought, great we can get to sleep at a reasonable time until, that is, 12.20am when pass the duchy on the left hand side blasted from the pool bar, out came the sleeping pills again. And we were on the 7th floor. If thats what you want on your holiday then its a great place, but then who can afford to drink all night at the hotel pool bar, $24 for 2 drinks. Its no use complaining because it goes on deaf ears.

<Content>Classic Experience! The Roosevelt Hollywood is a beautiful place to stay, especially if you want to experience the history of it. Marilyn Monroe used to live there in one of the suites above the pool, and she also had her first modeling job at the pool. Many of the old moviestars used to hang out at the hotel for drinks, and it still has that classy feel. The first Academy Awards was also held in one of the meeting rooms there.Rooms: The first night we stayed in the Cabana suite, which was amazing inside. It overlooks the pool, which as other reviews mentioned, does turn into a hotspot at night with fun music and a young crowd. The other nights we stayed in a standard room. It was very nice as well. Soft feather comforter! The only downside is that only the suite had bathroom counter space, so as a girl, it was hard to get ready with just a sink.Pool: The pool is one of the most popular, if not THE most popular, hotel pool in Hollywood. It's surrounded by 50s style suites, pretty palm trees, has wonderful soft lounge chairs/beds, as well as wait staff for food and drinks. The only reason I did not give this hotel a 5 star is because of some rude staff (not all of them, just some).There is a club called Teddy's that very popular, but it turns into a guest list only after 10 or 10:30. It is not owned by the hotel, so that's why people can't just get in even if they're staying at the hotel. Most bars/clubs at night are guest list only so you have to call during the day to get on the list or go early unless you're with all girls.Overall, this hotel is worth the stay just to experience both old and new Hollywood, and it's so close to everything else in LA. 15 min. from the beach, Beverly Hills, etc. The Kodak Theater with all of the famous gold stars and handprints is across the street. You can also see the Hollywood white letters too. The valet service is very friendly and helpful!

<Content>Pretty Good - But Pool Turns into Club Scene at Night I just returned from a 10 day stay at The Roosevelt. I'd heard good reviews from friends but was a little disappointed. I stayed in a regular room with 2 beds overlooking the roof (had a lovely view of the air conditioners). PROS:Bed was very nice -- soft white down comforter and pillows.Front desk and valet staff were very friendly and helpful.Location is great. Restaurants, food and walk of fame etc very close. There is a Longs a block away where you can buy anything you could ever possibly need.CONS:There is a coffee machine in the room but you have to pay 3.50 for the coffee in the mini bar. I've traveled all over the world and don't recall ever seeing that before, is it just me or is that a little ridiculous?Closet was dark due to the dark paint and lack of lighting. Water leaks out the side of the shower so you're guaranteed a pool of water under the sink after every shower.Overall it was a good experience but there is one thing I do want to mention. The pool turns into a club at night and can be a rather nice place to hang out - if you can get past the bouncers. I had no trouble getting in but some of my co-workers did. Despite being guests they were told they needed to be with girls and on another occasion they were told they needed to go change their clothes. Being a hotel guest doesn't guarantee entry or that they'll treat you with respect. So, if you're not in the mood for a club scene, as soon as they put up the velvet ropes avoid the pool.

<Content>for somebodies A beautiful hotel in a great spot in Hollywood (albeit very dark). The bell staff and housekeeping were very helpful and courteous. The reception staff were only interested in you if you were somebody (we weren't). Room small but well fitted out. Beware of the air-conditioning that sounds like a jet taking off and shares the scents of nearby rooms.

<Content>All around nice hotel. My boyfriend and I recently stayed at this hotel for our first trip to L.A. The hotel itself is very nice but dark everywhere. It's in a great location on Hollywood Blvd, within walking distance to many exciting attractions. We paid extra for a larger room and were disappointed to see how tiny it was. The shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom were really nice but they really need to figure something else out for the shower door, every time we took a shower the entire bathroom floor was covered in water. The lighting in the bathroom was horrible, the lights are red....no good for putting on makeup! Every night there seemed to be a private event at the pool that we were not allowed to go to. I would expect them to at least let paying guests attend!! Don't know what they do about guests in cabanas that have balconys that overlook the pool during these exclusive events. All in all it was nice and clean, I would stay here if the price was right but def. try to get a cabana! Oh and parking is $28 a day a little pricey and it always took them forever to bring me my car...I guess it wasn't nice enough to be in the front!

<Content>would not stay here again We stayed here from July 25th - July 29th 2008. It was the end of our Honeymoon after going to Vegas and Hawaii.Arrived late on a friday night, valet staff very kind and helpful. Checked in at reception, brief description given to us of where we had to go and where everything wasetc..I think we were in room 503. overlooking the back of the hotel roosevelt sign - neither of us were too worried about the view s didn't mind. Our room was vey modern and decorated nice however the rooms are Very Very small!! Bathrooms are tiny!!!!!! We found the bed too small and uncomfortable, very loud airconditioning fan that you can not turn off, I am not a light sleeper but it kept me awake - on the second night at around 3am I asked at the check in desk if they could get someone to come and turn it off. Very surprised that by the time i had returned to the room this had been done and an engineer had come to turn it off. However on return to the room the next day it had been turned back on again!!! Rooms werent overly clean and hotel in general very dark dingy and noisy. We didnt get to the pool or the restaurants.Valet staff helpfull pleasant and overall appeared to be nice people. Shame about the rest of the staff.Also be aware that when you check in they charge your credit card $150 for every night you will be there as incidentals then refund it on check out. We were not informed of this on check in and had tried to use our card whilst we were out and had it declined - took about 3 dys after checkout to have the money returned to our card.

<Content>Hollywood Roosevelt My friend and I stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt for 3 nights from 4 Aug 08. The location was really good for tourists without a car. Across the road was the Hollywood  Highland Center which had numerous shops and eateries. There was also a pharmacy and supermarket nearby.The hotel looks very luxurious inside as you would expect for the price (about $279/night + tax). We didn't get to the pool or Tropicana bar. There is a restaurant within the hotel for those wanting more than fast food.The room was fine, but wouldn't want to be any smaller. It had a fridge and well stocked mini bar, which we didn't take advantage of.The bathroom was a bit of a disappointment. It was small, but doable in terms of space, except for the toilet being too close to the wall. This is one of my pet hates along with a passive air vent rather than an electric exhaust fan, so the bathroom fogged up quickly and took a while to de-fog. They provided nice toiletries.Our room looked out over.. a rooftop. Our room also backed on to the elevators and so there was some noise at night when they were used. Other rooms shouldn't have had this issue.If you need a taxi, the valet parking guys have taxis on standby that they call over immediately.I believe they had two standing only internet terminals for guests.Overall, the hotel was fine, but bathroom let it down. Location was good.

<Content>Lost Soul My family and I visisted this hotel six years ago and we were disappointed with the changes when we re-visited in June.The historical lobby is no longer the main entrance and is very dingy and dark. All the historical material and the piano has been removed so it feels soulless.When private parties are held at the hotel, residents are not allowed to use the Hollywood Boulevard entrance, the lobby, the pool or the gym.When we arrived after being up for nearly 24 hours, we had to prove we had a reservation before we were allowed on to the premises. They seemed to be more interested in the celebrities than their hotel guests.Non residents are allowed to use the pool which regularly means there is no where to sit. Also, you are not allowed to eat your own food there as they have a small restaurant which serves food and drink.The gift shop appears to be stocked with fashionable items which are very expensive and are not for the regular tourist.The hotel prides itself on the fact that the Oscars were held there but you would be hard pressed to see any evidence.The air conditioning was very loud and would keep light sleepers awake.On a positive note, the room we stayed in was very clean and the position of the hotel is excellent for visiting the area.

<Content>The Roosevelt Hotel-SPA Had one main issue- THE SPA. The massages were a total rip-off!!!! three one hour sessions totaled to $600!!! What they call the spa garden is located right next to the busy streets. How is one suppose to relax when you can hear the traffic as clear as if you were on the sidewalk. I do not recommend it!!! save your money and go to a real spa... The rest was great!!!

<Content>Awful Hotel ....worst ever and I`ve seen bad Shocked the rooms have a door connecting to the room next door with no sound proofing and believe me you can even hear a whisper. The first night was respectable guests next to us trying their best to whisper the second night was a couple having sex. The manager can close the pool and parts of the hotel for private functions so tough if your stay falls then but you do get a photocopied letter. As a guest you are a number not a guest, you will not be back but the room will be filled tomorrow attitude . Two nights with constant sleep disturbance ruined our time in the day to see sights as we didn`t have the energy. At todays standards it would be a UK three star rating...just half the price and it still wouldn`t be worth the stay it survives by name and location which incidently we thought has seen its day and now the area is run down and seedy. Never again. Horrible.

<Content>What the ???? Upon arrival on Tuesday July 22 we were greeted by a very gracious and professional Valet service. Check in was freindly and pleasant. I was in Room 132 explained by the front desk as an exceptional poolside room. Once in our room pleasantly surprised very nice modern room. Upon our return from Hollywood blvd with a few bags we were stopped and elegantly questioned and finally asked for our names to verify that we were staying at the hotel. Ok everyone has a job to to. When I questioned her why, she thought the bags of snacks were unusual at the hotel. OK whatever. Went to dinner and then to the Laugh factory and returned at approx. 1AM. WOW the pool was area was alive even a DJ. Now my exceptional room was right at the very very busy bar and I could not turn up my TV loud enough to drown out the DJ. Through out the night my exceptional room was at the bar back entrance that seemed to be very busy with bottles, glasses and who knows what delivery cleaning ect...I was awoken by a car alarm that would not stop. Now I learn that my exceptional room was across and below a parking garage. Leave my room for breakfast and a nice NYtimes was at my door. Upon my return at approx. 11pm here we go again party at the pool, DJ, glasses, bottles etc...No morning paper the nextday.Upon our return late thursday night the pool was somewhat quiet. Go to take a shower and no towels. OK NO big deal just went to bed. Then at aprrox. 1am the pool area came to life again.On Friday morning my exceptional room now was next to an electrical closet that was being worked on at 707AM. Stuck my head out the door about the noise and the guy said Ok and continued to drill and hammer. Once again this morning No paper. Attempted to return to sleep and just turned the TV on to help kill the noise, at 830 housekeeping knocks on the door this is the first time we have encounter her an I have no clue in what she was asking so I just said No thanks come back later we are checking out.What more can I say than just WOW ! Think twice and question when they tell you that you have an exceptional room.

<Content>great hotel, great service stayed at hotel november 2007 and june 2008. great location, but attitude staff below average my first trip. because of location i chose to stay when i was back in LA in june. the personal service has really picked up. i think they hired new personable agents or they were not working when i was there in nov.. they were very helpful. they took care of a room change with speed and care. they made me feel like a million bucks.they are good looking too!

<Content>Loud and obnoxious Stayed here while on a business trip. It has a great poolside bar for cocktails, two great restaurant options and the cabana rooms were super cool (although a bit dark). Everything seemed to be great and, with all the high security, we were convinced there must be a celebrity staying there. In the early evening, the cabana bar started playing music that was really loud but really good. Fine, I thought, by the time I get back from a late dinner I'm sure they will turn it off - there's no way they'd expect guests staying in the cabana rooms to sleep with that music blaring. When I returned at 11pm the music was still going strong. I thought about switching rooms to the main tower where it might be quieter but, again, thought management couldn't possibly keep the music going all night. I was wrong. After a bleary-eyed investigation at 1 am I realized there were literally speakers right outside my room! At 2 a.m. they finally turned off the music. I was exhausted and had a full day of work ahead of me and had just paid a small fortune for the room.I'm only in my early thirties and usually not bothered by good music. But how do they expect anyone except twenty-something party-goers to stay here?

<Content>First time visitor in L.A We had a great time, living on the ninth floor. Perfect location for a first time visitor in L.A. It's near to all cool classical places if you wanna tick off the the hollowood to do list! The pool area is really nice, and during night it turns in to an outdoor club/bar.We had a lot of help from the Concierge, Tao, who made a great effort to make our stay and experiences in California great.We stayed five nights at the hotel.Complains could be that the breakfast place in the hotel, 24 degrees, wasn't that great. Boring menu and the last day we unfortunately had a very rud woman serving us...

I am an extreme clean freak  this hotel lived up to my desires.The after party for the BET awards were being held there, so alot of celebs were there and young people in general, which is the kind/type of people that this hotel is perfect for.Other reviewers pics are exacltly how the rooms look, a little better though and the ground floor decor is absolutley gorgeous.Definatly contact me for more infoP.S.

<Content>Great location, but hotel very pretentious Positives first, a great location for experiencing Hollywood. First impressions of hotel were good, lovely decor in lobby. Pool is lovely if you can get a sunlounger, waited over an hour for one on our first day there. Room was quite small and carpet was very shabby. Housekeeping services was the main reason we were disappointed with hotel as twice in the week our room was not serviced. On returning from a day out after 5pm we found that our room had not been done. We rang the front desk and told them that room would be empty at 6pm as we were going out to eat. We returned after 9pm to find that maid was only just doing our room. We then had to wait in hall for her to finish. Air conditioning is also very noisy but not as noisy as the having window open as pool area empties between 12 and 2am. Right hotel for someone wanting lively atmosphere and late nights but not for someone wanting relaxing time.

<Content>Great Location!! Loved the Pool! Def. stay here again! My mother and I stayed at the Roosevelt for 4 nights and I couldn't get enough!! The hotel is in a great location right on the Walk of Stars in Hollywood! The hotel was right across from the Chinese theater where there was a red carpet event during the time we stayed there. We also went to the Jimmy Kimmel show right down the street from the hotel. The hotel is clean and the rooms are hip with a contemporary feel to them. I would definitely reccomend this hotel for any age. The pool was great, but the prices of drinks are ridiculous! The hotel staff was nice, but come to Hollywood with a plan of what you want to see and do, don't count on them to help with planning. I loved this hotel and area, and can't wait to go back!! Also, there is a restaurant called 25degrees and they have the best burgers!!

<Content>YOBS 1 FAMILIES 0 ! Stayed at the Hotel a total of 4 nights in blocks of 1 and 3 nights over 2 week period as part of a major birthday treat.Was put in a large twin double bed room the first night due to mix up with our booking. The room was extremeley nice except for a rather noisey fan which are in most of the rooms. Ordered room service which was quick and very high standard. We left the next day looking forward to our return trip.On our return trip put in a more smaller standard room, which was fine because that it what we expected to be in. It had adjoining doors and that is when our problem started. At 3am we were woken by the most astounding noise also consider we had a young child with us. A group of youths were using the adjoining wall as a soccer net. There were shouts,screams and bangs which sounded like it was coming from inside the room. After 15 minutes of this we rang the front desk who said they would sort it out. A further 30 minutes later still no end to this noise, our child was quite scared by then. We rang again and explained we had a young family and by now glass's could be heard smashing and foul language clearly heard. Their response was casual but they would sort it. A further 15minutes later and by now they were up and down the corridors with a video recorder which was the final straw.. I made my way to the front desk and spoke to a very sleepy HINT HINT looking night manager whose only solution was for us at 4am to move to another room which i suggested because the noise had not stopped and we had to be up early the next morning.On telling my wife this she rang the front desk a threatned to call the police to sort it [ which is amazing when you see how much security is on in the daytime] and surprise suprise within 15minutes everthing was quiet.We could not speak to anybody first thing the next day due to us leaving for a trip early and nobody available.To cut a long story short it took 2 hours of chasing when we returned to get an solution from the Management about the next night because our child was to scared to stay in the room.We were told to our amazement that it was not the Hotel's policy to throw these type of noisy people out or move them and it would have to be us that moved room's.The only positive thing about this incident is they put us in a suite but the only thing we wanted was COMMON SENSE as we were not after a freebie.Pleased be warned of our experience if you are due to take family's their and require a good nights sleep! This hotel is set up to be a adult playground which is a pity because as a hotel it is quite unique and different than more modern hotels.

<Content>Great Vacation!! I had read some sketchy reviews about the Roosevelt but decided to check it out anyway. The location of the hotel is awesome and is very close to everything. We arrived at the hotel around 2pm and our room was ready for check in. The room was nicely renovated with 2 queen beds and 2 bathrooms. It was pretty big and very clean.The cleaning staff was amazing. Everytime I returned to the room it was clean and the beds were made up. The pool area was beautiful and the bar had a large selection of mojitos and other drinks and snacks. The food was ok and a liitle pricey but hey, you're at a pool so what do you expect. The hotel had a few restaurants, the Tropicana (pool) Bar and Teddys, which is independently owned. We had no problem getting in to Teddys and also had a great time.The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The concierge people, Lauren and Adam, def made our trip great. They got us dinner reservations to Koi and Boa, both great, and also got us into Goa and Villa Lounge. Granted, we spent over $3000 at Villa, but it's still the toughest club to get into in LA at this time. Sunday and Monday there were pool parties at the Hotel which featured different dj's and a ton of hot people.Loved the Roosevelt, can't wait to go back.Constantine, NY,NY

<Content>Worst hotel experience ever I was very optimistic to experience the Roosevelt during a busy summer weekend. However, my experience was awful. The hotel's elevators were broken the entire weekend which resulted in a 20 minute waiting period to take my bags up to the room and several trip up and down the stairs to the 8th floor. The staff was also very unaccommodating. I got the feeling that they didn't care if we enjoyed our stay or were satisfied because they would have guests no matter what because of their name and didn't care if we ever returned, which we wouldn't anyways. They also would not allow more than 2 guests per a room at the pool, which only has 90 chairs for the 700 guests to boot. If you wanted a chair you had to get up a dawn and sit in your chair for the entire day or else you would lose it. If you expect to lay out or party at the pool, it is very difficult to do. The hotel also allows their guests aka, people who greased the pool bouncers and front desk people, to be at the pool making it even more crowded and much harder to get a $15 drink. Don't stay here, you will be disappointed. This is not only my opinion, but many other people who were staying there at the same time also spoke this way and said they would never stay there again. Being a guest also does not give you any priority at the door for Teddy's or the Tropicana Bar. Use your money elsewhere.

<Content>Not worth the money The hotel is nice. Rooms are small. My AC was not blowing air my first night. This was probably due do a dirty filter. The smoke alarm in front of the vent was covered in dirt.The shower pressure was so high I couldn't put my face under it-and I'm not exaggerating. It was the worst shower ever and that is not good early in the AM. The stall was 1/2 door style so the water soaked the floor unavoidably. I had to shower with my side pressed against the shower wall. The sink was leaking water from the pipes. The bottom of the porcelain was mildewy because of this. The staff corrected the AC problem when advised but not the shower issue. The pool is beautiful but the servers are want to be actresses who are lazy, slow and less than friendly. They are not much to look at either. This hotel is way overpriced. I don't mind paying for a nice stay-I expense it anyway-this was just not worth it.

<Content>Nice stay at the Roosevelt After a terrible experience at The Standard I was very pleased with my stay at the Roosevelt. First of, I just want to say that the staff (especially after staying at The Standard) is extremely nice and helpful. They really do go out of their way to make you stay pleasant.We got a garden view cabana room....and...were frightened when we walked in...to put in nicely, you want to commit suicide if you stay there too long...dont know who's brilliant idea was to paint a room BLACK (!!!) but it doesnt add cheerfulness to say the least. After staying there for a few hours we headed to the front desk at around 2am and after speaking the with concierge (who smiled upon hearing the suicidal remark) were offered a second floor pool view cabana room for no extra charge. Normally these rooms go for about $400 (we originally paid $240 on expedia)The beds are super-comfortable and the mini bar is great....i think a bottle of Patron really changes ones mood...Pool area is very nice and big....its really busy on the weekends and there are quite a few good looking LA folks hanging aroundOverall, I would recommend this hotel...just stay away from the black room :)))

<Content>Probably a good hotel for Europeans who want the surreal Hollywood experience First I will say that this hotel tries so hard to be cool and the 'it' place to stay but would be better suited to invest that money on a new elevator and carpeting. Recently stayed here to find the elevator broken, the gym and fitness center shut down. So I thought, hey I'll go for a swim in the famed Hockney pool. Well that pool is only for supermodel wannabe types and there's a major scene there--so if that's the kind of Hollywod experience you want then the hotel pool is for you. The rooms are small, and while there have been some nice touches like quality bedding, nice vibe, it just doesn't mask that this is essentially an ancient hotel.Last, my pre-ordered room service didn't arrive and that really cheesed me off .....and I don't like having to pay for coffee when they provide a coffee maker...So, that's the negative, there are many positives to this place although I'm not sure if they'd be enough for me to stay again. The location is great, right across from Mann's chinese theatre and on the walk of fame. The Fresh toiletries are a really nice touch, the rooms are immaculate and the linens are good quality. Free internet access in lobby is nice and the Hamburger restaurant attached to the hotel is excellent.

<Content>Do not charge room service!!!!! I stayed for two nights in October 2007 with a friend. I had stayed in LA before and had drinks in the Roosevelt and promised myself if i ever returned i would stay there really because of its location. Hotel didnt fail to impress, rooms were spacious, well stocked mini bar( which caused me to cry upon checking out) and lovely bathroom products. Back to the mini bar...... my friend and i emptied the mini bar on our first night, we knew we were paying a premium but what the heck we were on our holidays. The second night we noticed that the minibar hadn't been restocked during the day so i rang house keeping and asked them to refill it. Housekeeping asked if there was anything in particular i required. I said Vodka! certainly madam, would you prefer a large bottle yes please. Checking out the next day noticed bill was twice what i was expecting. I queried it with reception and they explained there was a 515 dollar charge to the room. The litre of voda cost 400 dollars, 6 cans of coke and state tax bought the total to 515 dollars. If we had bought the equivalent in minatures from the mini bar the cost would have only been 170 dollars. I have never felt so done in my entire life. Please dont let my tale of woe put you off staying at this hotel, but beware mini bars are the work of the Devil!!!

<Content>Loved the Ambience We wanted to stay in a hotel that had some character this hotel oozes glamour and is very elegant. We were not disappointed with our choice. We did book a supieror room and on checking in found the reception and bell staff very friendly and helpful. We were upgraded to a poolside cabana room and we accepted even though we were fully aware of the reviews mentioning the noise problem from Tropicana Bar. We found the music was louder during the day then late at night, however we were at the Tropicana bar until 12.30am anyway. I have read alot of the comments that the hotel is dark this is true however I found it to be in keeping with the hotels atmosphere and creates the elegant ambience expecially in the main lobby and bar areas. We had pre dinner drinks in Teddys/Library bar great atmosphere and dined in Dakota for dinner the service and food was great. The hotel is very central to everything in Hollywood and there was even a movie premier across the road. You will also find that most of the tour groups leave from the Kodak Theatre across the road. The only down side was that the concierge didn't book our airport shuttle after she said she would and we were lucky enough to get one at the last minute (1 hour before we had be picked up).

<Content>Great hotel - not for families My brother and I stayed at the Roosevelt from April 9 to 13, 2008. Front desk staff was extremely helpful and polite, as was the concierge, both giving us great dining and partying suggestions, and helping get us in to the hottest places in Hollywood.The room was average, nothing to brag about. We had room 510 (2 double beds). It is true that the bathrooms are a bit tight, and the furniture, although it looks modern (due to dark colors) is a bit old and chipped here and there, but I really can't complain that much. If you're staying at the Roosevelt, it's not cause you're going to be in the room much!!!25 degrees and Dakota are both excellent restaurants. I had one of the best steaks of my life at Dakota (and I've eaten alot of steak all over the US and Canada!!!). Tropicana bar is the place to be in Hollywood after dark, as well as happy hour! (don't even bother going to clubs, Tropicana and the lobby bar is where the action is at!!)The hotel is great for the 21-35 crowd, but I don't see it being that great for families (it's kind of dark, literally not much lighting, everywhere) and lots socializing... Overall, great place to stay, would stay again, but Hollywood and L.A. in general is not what we expected. If you go to California, go to San Diego, Santa Monica, Pasadena, Venice beach and Disney land (all beautiful), and try to spend as little time in hollywood or L.A. as possible (beverly hills is the only thing to see there, and that's a half day situation, extensive shopping included!)

<Content>Unique experience If you want a brand new hotel with all the amenities and clean lines of a new hotel, this place is not for you. However, if you want a unique experience at an old Hollywood hotel, then book it. While some of the rooms are very small, and they don't come cheaply, the service that we received from the concierges (Lauren and Adam), bellhops, and parking attendants was outstanding. They exerted a fair amount of effort to ensure that our trip was pleasant and our needs were taken care of. The lobby of the Roosevelt is one of the prettiest lobbies (again old) of any hotel I have stayed. I found the 25 degrees restaurant (open 24 hours) to be above average - although their menu was a little oddly set up. The room was not spectacular, but I believe that is what you get with an older hotel. The bed was relatively comfortable and bathroom was small (hard for the fatter than average American) and had a shower drain that drained very slowly. However, the location was amazing, convenient to many things (we drove to Beverly Hills in 15 minutes, West Hollywood in 10, Hollywood sign in 5, Warner Studios in 15-20, and out to Santa Monica in 30-35 - all in LA traffic). I would recommend as long as you are okay with older hotels.

<Content>Very very disappointing. Besides the great location, there is nothing else going for the Roosevelt Hotel. We arrived in the morning to find very rude and unfriendly front desk staff. When I got to my room 503, it was small, smelly, and dark. I had nowhere to put my clothes, so kept them in my suitcase in the cupboard. The cupboard was so dark; I had to take the suitcase out every time to see what I was doing. The TV was on top of the fridge. The furniture was old and chipped.My son had room 502. It was much bigger, had a chest of drawers for clothes plus the fridge. It had a big flat screen TV and it did not smell. I rang the front desk to ask why both rooms are the same rate, yet one is far inferior to the other? I was told, the cost of a queen bed is the same no matter the surroundings.The bathroom s are extremely inconvenient. The tiny scratched shelf above the toilet, and the vertical storage that looks like an old cd unit, were not adequate at all. I had no where to put my toiletries, as that unit isn鈥檛 big enough to hold bottles upright. I had to close the toilet and use the lid when I wanted to apply my make up or dry my hair. I had to bend down under the basin to find the hair dryer.I was waiting for an envelope to be left for me at the hotel in the afternoon. I asked the desk many times from about 6pm to 9pm, if the envelope had arrived. I was told no. At about 10.30pm I found it underneath my door. Please be advised that on enquiry the envelope had been delivered to the Roosevelt at 5.30pm!!! It took 5 hours to go up 5 floors. At 1am on the same night, I was woken by Room Service who asked me what I wanted to order.I had not put in a call or an order to Room Service.Lauren the concerge is very nice, and the food at 25deg. Other than that, I will not ever give the Roosevelt even a second thought.

<Content>Not at all what I was expecting We were told that the Roosevelt was the place to stay in Hollywood. Our check in time was 3p.m. and we arrived at 8p.m. we were told our room was not ready and could be put into a different room. The hotel is very dark, and the room was not as clean as we would have expected it to be. The airconditioning stayed on all night and would not turn off. The carpet was old and very stained. The following night we left our room and returned in the evening around 8p.m to find a do not disturb sign on our door. We entered to find housekeeping changing the beds kind of late i would have thought they did this in the morning. They had no cleaning supplies and a small black tote bag in which she emptied the garbage cans. The whole thing was unsettling. Next we decided to unwind at the pool, we read the clearly visible sign that said the pool was open until 10p.m. this was 8:30 we were asked to leave by a large very unfriendly thugish looking man in a trench coat. He said there was no swimming after 8 and that the sign was a techinicality. The whole experience was bad, i wish we had stayed at the renassaince infact the days inn would have been better. Upon check out we were asked how are stay was, we said horrible and they said oh. Do yourself a favor and dont ruin your trip here

<Content>Bring Your Own Beer? Not Here!!!!!! OVERPRICED, OVERRATED ROOMS that resemble more of a glorified Best Western than a historical top-rated hotel. Worst of all, security CONFISCATED OUR 12-PACK OF BEER in elevator, citing hotel policy that prohibits guests from taking alcohol to their rooms!!! This after paying $300/night. Although the front desk returned our beer in the morning and promised to refund our mini-bar charges, we had to call the hotel several times to actually get the credit posted. In addition, the credit manager promised to refund our $30 parking charge but later reneged on this and offered no other remuneration.

<Content>Great location Stayed for 6 nights in two different rooms . Great location across the road from the Kodak Theatre. Unique Hotel with a very dark atmosphere, rooms were very modern recently remodelled. Negatives were the parking is very expensive, $28 per night valet. After the first night I hunted around for cheaper parking in the area and found great overnight parking next to the Renaissance hotel for only $10 per night in a very safe,huge parking garage,only a short walk up the road. I had similar problems as previous reviewers firstly the fan for the Aircon wouldn't turn off , it was very noisy and I wouldn't have been able to sleep, had to call maintence to turn off via a circuit breaker.When checking into hotel please check room first as they vary, we had a room across the hall from the X35 room previously mentioned by a reviewer and I agree the elevator is very noisy it sounded like thunder every time it went up and down. We also had the problem of the front and side entrance being locked because of a function , which meant we had to walk around the back in the cold wind, they should have a security entrance that uses the room key. In my opinion I would have rather stayed at the Renaissance hotel it still has the same great location .

<Content>Outstanding experience at Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel We stayed at the hotel for our anniversay on March 24, 2008.The front desk staff was extremely accomodating  very pleasant.Our room was beautiful, large and more than we expected.The view from our windows overlooked Hollywood Blvd and we didn't hear any noises from below. We chose to stay at the hotel so we could walk to other restaurants, the Kodak Theater ,Mann's Chinese Theater and other attractions. We enjoyed the look and feel of a older, historic hotel, but with the amenities of a newer facility.It was a perfect evening and will return again soon. From Huntington Beach, CA

<Content>No More History At The Roosevelt The new Hollywood Roosevelt now hides its historical legacy. This is a very different hotel than it was 5-10 years ago. Its' location along Hollywood Boulevard is still unbeatable, but the hotel's atmosphere does not welcome tourists and history buffs anymore...

<Content>All gloss- less substance... We had travelled the length of California and were winding our trip in Hotel Roosevelt. Based on all the hype we were probably more excited about tis place than anywhere else we had stayed. However, on arrival we were told the pool was closed (there was a film premiere party there that night) and we would have to use a nearby hotel (across the road) if we wanted a swim. Call me old fashioned but at the rates we were paying I didn't fancy flip flopping my way across Hollywood Boulevard to get to someone else's pool!The room was small with an atrocious view of the roof where maintainance men had decided to crack open a crate of beers and have a bit of a chin wag. A loud chin wag that went on for a few hours...There's no denying that the lobby of the hotel is beautiful, the location excellent and that the staff were helpful (apart from the bouncer who tried to throw us out of the hotel when he thought we were trying to gatecrash the aforementioned premiere- despite our displaying a room key and obviously walking towards our room!). Ultimately I think that this is one hotel that needs to offer a consistent service to live up to its own hype.

<Content>Great Location!!! We arrived in Hollywood and were quite overwelmed by the fast pace of the place and were even more shocked by the valet parking at the Roosevelt hotel - it was very expensive. We were a bit early for check in but there were no problems. The room itself was a bit small but had everything in it.The decor of the hotel was lovely and the lobby was out of this world. There were quite a few weddings taking place in it while we were there.The pool was a different story!! Impossible to get a bed and at times was closed without any notice!! The one time that we did actually get to the pool (a sunday) it was terrible!! There seemed to be an influx of young, hip, toned and very loud people who had stayed in the hotel for the weekend. We felt totally out of place with our books while quietly sunbathing!! The norm appeared to be very much loudness, drinking and dancing by the pool!! One of these sunbathers was one of the contestants from Americas Next Top Model - not our cup of tea I'm afraid.Overall the location is excellent. Mann's Chinese Theatre and the Kodak Theatre are across the road and all the other main attractions such as Universal Studios and Venice Beach are all very close by. Great hotel for celeb spotting - Rushour 3 premiered across the road!The staff were also very friendly and it was nice to say we stayed in the Roosevelt hotel but I don't think we would stay in it again.

<Content>closed pool at no notice. Dodgy local cabs Nice rooms, if a bit small and only showers we have Cabanna pool rooms, but on second day at no notice (we negotiated the pool rooms on arrival) they simply closed the pool for renovation for a week. So in instead of pool rooms, we had building site rooms! Compliants lead to an upgrade, but would I have booked an LA hotel with no pool in first place? No. It was an expensive con.Watch out for local taxi rank - utter rip off as they take the long route, and room service ridiculously expensive. Gym nice, but no sauna or steam room. Dont book Cabanna rooms if you like an early night. Stupid loud music played into the night some nights.Le Montrose better.

<Content>Could use some sprucing up! The Roosevelt Hotel is a totally FINE experience for someone who wants to be out and about and enjoy LA. The price was reasonable enough, the rooms were fine, and there is a fun scene at the pool bar. As per other reviewers, the parking is expensive-- it is actually $28/day and we imagined we would just use public parking but all the parking nearby is closed overnight, so this is impossible. We looked at 5 rooms before we found one that was a reasonable size (and we were not in the cheapest room category) and then, picked one that smelled of smoke, because at least we could walk around it. The rooms were all quite worn-- chipped furniture, chipped bathtubs, but it did seem clean enough. All in all, I don't feel the need to COMPLAIN about the hotel, but I wouldn't give it a rave either. It is a good place to stay if you are in LA to have fun-- out and about during the day and on the town at night...

<Content>Very good, couple of reservations This is a very good historic hotel that has been extremely well restored (check out the lobby). Excellent location virtually opposite Grauman's theatre. The room was an ok size, sufficient for the 4 nights I stayed there. Staff very helpful and friendly - excellent concierge. Nice pool and bar. Main gripe was that you can hear every word of your neighbours next door. No soundproofing in evidence -- I am encountering this problem regularly when I stay in hotels worldwide these days.Other than that treat yourself to a nice merger of old and new Hollywood (also recommended an excellent steak at the hotels Dakota restaurant and propably the best burger I've ever had at 25 Degrees also on site).

<Content>Great Hotel! I stayed at this hotel for two nights while on business in Hollywood, CA and I really enjoyed my stay. This is a great hotel (high 4 stars) and it is very different from most luxury hotels I've stayed at. The design is modern and chique and this fits in well with Hollywood Blvd. Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere, the cleanliness of the hotel, the quality of the accommodations, and the convenience to where I needed to be. Also, it was nice meeting celebrities by the pool at night!Here are some things I did not like:1. No Heat. There was AC only. At night, temperatures in LA dropped to 30 degrees and heat was needed.2. There is only a fitted sheet and a comforter on the bed. There is no sheets between the fitted sheet and the comforter. You use the comforter as your only blanket. While the front desk assured me they clean each comforter every night, I like a sheet and I found this unusual.3. The bathroom was dimly lit.4. The lobby is a historic and well decorated lobby. Yet, it has the atmosphere of a night club. There is virtually no light except for candles and I thought this was a shame. It's an impressive lobby and I would have liked to enjoy this room.

<Content>Interesting I'd booked a deluxe room as I was hoping this would be away from the noise. I was offered an upgrade to a suite for $50. Great I thought until he told me it was $50 a night. I was there for 3 and we took the upgrade as we'd just stayed at the best hotel ever in Vegas (Thanks Tripadvisor!). This is an old hotel that has had a facelift (or two, this being LA and all!!) . The room was probably two rooms in a past life, but it was worth the extra money to have all that space. Half of it may have been too small. We had a great view of the Chinese Theatre and Hollywood sign. We were on the 9th floor.It was too cold and grey to use the pool, and we only saw it on our last day anyway. Looks like a great place to spend time. The lobby bar is pricey, but it is classy and funky. We could hear it from our room at night, the bass throbbing through the building. Thankfully earplugs and sleeping tablets helped hide that! As a first time tourist to LA its hard to find somewhere central to stay in a town that has no heart. For a location though this wasn't bad as the boulovard wasn't too unsafe at night, given the crowds outside. Loads of safe places in the Hollywood and Highlands complex next to the Kodak Theatre as well as the ones in the hotel - Note 21 degrees burgers - order one mixed portion of onion rings and fries for two as it's plenty! This isn't a cookie cutter hotel, so expect it to have a bit of charm and character for it's age. It's a funky place to stay and if you are looking for the different, then come here. If you want a standard type of hotel, then go to a Hitlon or Marriot etc.

<Content>Over-rated closet Location, location, location!!Those would be the only 3 reasons why you should consider the Roosevelt. Can't complain about the rate cos they tell you that before you hand over your credit card. However, they really should be more realistic in their room descriptions!I stayed in a traditional guest room for $299/night (and this was discounted). The room turned out to be dark, musty, and tiny with barely any artwork or furniture. Just a lumpy, platform bed with old sheets, a desk with office chair, an older model TV, a mini fridge and a wall mirror. I've stayed at the Sheraton for $199 with more luxurious amenities! My view?? I had a spectacular view of the Roosevelt's rooftop and air conditioning units! Lovely.I would love to go on about the bathroom but that would bring on a claustrophobic attack.

<Content>Great hollywood location Stayed here early November 07 and had a great time. Would recommend to someone who hasn't been to LA and wants to be close to the sites like Hollywood Blvd  Walk of Fame, Hollywood  Highland Shopping Mall (at your doorsteps) and Universal Studios  Hollywood Bowl (15mins drive away). The Good - Great location - Beautiful historic hotel - Rooms overlooking the pool / Tropicana Bar are new and modern, comfy bed, adequate size bathroom  shower. - Great hotel dining options: Dakota is worth the splurge and they serve great burgers at the 25 degrees diner. - free internet service in lobby - Celebrities do frequent the hotel, we saw Colin Farrel having a few drinks at the Tropicana Bar one afternoon while we were there - Tropicana does a great cheese plateThe bad - Rooms overlooking the pool are noisy - the Tropicana Bar is open till 2am - its a shame they didn't double glaze the windowsDining tipsWe ate at some great places, and would recommend them: - Dakota - the hotel restaurant and a famous steakhouse. Very nice and good if you don't like steak also. - the Bowery, on W Sunst Blvd (about 15 mins walk) - nice burgers - Franko and Musso's Grill: this place has a lot of history and it was cool to visit

<Content>OK experience The hotel is located in a great area within driving and walking to distances to just about anything. Just be warned...if you have a car you have to pay to park the car overnight for 23 bucks. The pool parties there are fun but hotel not very kid friendly. I would stay there again only not with my kid.

<Content>Pretty Cool Place My friends and I came to stay at the roosevelt for halloween weekend. We had a blast at the party, the rooms are pretty big, my only complaint is how small the bathrooms are. Everyone at the hotel is really nice, check in was a breeze, make sure you ask for ingrid . the y have an aewsome gift store thats kinda hard to find but it has great stuff, ask for tayler. Overall, its a cool place to party with your friends, but the halls are really poorly lit and its really dark, so its not for older people.

<Content>Cool, Cool, Cool - a great place to stay. As a traveling musician, I stayed at the Roosevelt while playing a show in Hollywood. My wife and I were issued a beautiful corner room overlooking the famed Hollywood sign and the Chinese theater out one window, and and the walk of fame, a great view of the city and other landmarks out the other window. The room was very modern, but homey, with a flat screen television, high speed internet, a very comfortable bed, and a great bathroom. Lots of storage space was nice as well.As great as the accomodations were, the service is what really knocked me off my feet. Everyone on staff, from the waiters and waitresses, the front desk personel, the cleaning staff, and even the valet staff were very courteous, friendly and - gasp - helpful! Much different from what I expected in Los Angeles of all places.(If you're into it, we also saw a number of Celebrities while staying at the Roosevelt. Not necessarily my thing, but still kinda cool.....) The restaurants in the hotel were top notch as well, especially 25 degrees, where I had one of the best gourment hamburgers I've ever tasted (at 4am in the morning, nonetheless). If you're in town to see the sights of Hollywood, there's probably no better place to stay. The price might be a deterrent to some, but if you want to truly experience the area, this is worth every penny.

I stayed here on a business trip and was so sad when business got in the way. Great location, close to shopping, the chinese theatre, in and out burger, and everything LA. The pool is defintely amazing! The waitress service is a little slow but just relaxing in the sun on the comfy lounge chairs makes up for it. Great bar at the pool as well. The rooms were huge with tons of space. the bathrooms were a bit small but everything was extremely clean. The only issue we had with the hotel was that they lost our boxes for 12 hours. The staff decided to take a break and go watch the prince concert in the hotel and we were put behind our deadline by 12 hours. Make sure if you are shipping they check everywhere! Overall amazing experience and will defintely go back. Something is always happening at night and you are mixed in with the Hollywood A listers.

<Content>The place to be I have read many mixed reviews so I was a bit skeptical on staying here but I'm glad I did! The hotel is in great shape and I love the minimalistic approach on design! If you are looking for an American chain type hotel this is not it! Also if you are on a budget this is not the place to stay. It is minimally lit but it adds to the ambience and feel. The staff was awesome, There were several celebs there at the time I was and I can honestly say I was treated with the same respect as they were. This demonstrated a truly proffesional staff to me! GM/Cadillac had a VIP comp ride promo going and the staff who ran that were awesome too (Thanks guys!) It's a hip, happening place, the poolside bar was fun (except is closes too early!) it's like an oasis from the street scene. Food was good and not any higher priced than what I am use to paying at home (bay area). You are close to theaters and the VERY touristy Hollywood Blvd. I would reccommend this hotel to my friends and look forward to staying there again! The rooms were very clean and I don't know what the people were saying when they stated the beds were aweful, mine was so comfy I got the best sleep I've had in a long time! I didn't have a camera so no pictures, but the website gives a very good depiction of what you will see when you get there.

<Content>There's better in LA The Roosevelt is a good quality hotel with a lot of history. The location isn't the best with many homeless people lurching around outside. Handy for the Kodak theatre I guess though.The pool is lovely and the rooms are of a good size and are well equipped. The bar and retaurant are also very good, even if the lobby is extremly dark.It's not cheap though and for the money there are better located hotels of a smilar standard in LA.

<Content>Loved the Roosevelt We recently stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel for a short girls weekend to L.A (my friends and I are 30). The hotel is in a perfect location to many great restaurants and night clubs. The entire hotel staff were very friendly and accomodating, particularly the bellmen and concierge service. The hotel itself is very nice including the pool area, the weather was a little cool for us so we did not spend much time by the pool, if it had been warmer I think the pool area would have been great. The only time we actually ate at one of the hotel restaurants was for lunch by the pool, the food was excellent. The hotel rooms were very spacious, we had 4 girls in one room and did not have any issues with it feeling too crowded compared to other places we have stayed.We also were a little concerned with some of the reviews we had read but had no issues getting whatever we needed as far as room service/housekeeping and overall just very friendly service. I would definately reccommend this hotel to anyone. I would also strongly recommend that guests use the concierge service. They are absolutely wonderful here (Andrea and Ben) and were very helpful to us with getting reservations, recommendations on where to go, answering our questions, etc. We had a great time at the Roosevelt and will definately stay here again the next time we come to L.A.!

<Content>Scarey neighborhood Roosevelt Hotel is nice with nice pool. Very dark interior. On a scarey street with many homeless. Many young people staying there. I'm only 43!?! Not for kids. The pool and bar turns into a really cool atmosophere at night with fireplaces, etc. Perfect to see Jimmy Kimmel show though.

<Content>Not a 4 Star This hotel is not a 4 star in my book. It may have been so when Roosevelt was president, but not any longer. The service was good, but the room was a bit of a beater. For example, the paint/varnish on the wood trim was considerably chipped and worn. The rooms could use remodeling. The room was very small for American standards. There was little room to walk around or place luggage. The bath was quite small as well.

<Content>An 'OK' Hotel I don't really have much good or bad to say about this hotel. The staff were friendly, the pool has nice. Didn't really like the location but that depends on what your looking for !! The room was small but thats what you expect in a city hotel. I did like the old hollywood feel to the hotel.

<Content>Week in California We spent 3 nights at the Roosevelt and enjoyed our time overall. The check in process was very smooth and the staff treated us very well and made us feel very welcome. When we arrived to our room it was very warm. Told the bell boy about it when he brought our luggage and house keeping was notified right away. Seems all you need to fix anything at the Roosevelt is a pair of pliers! Maintance opened up several boxes in the room and hit the air conditioner several times with the pliers and we had a comfortable room! Made us laugh very hard when they left. On our second day at the Roosevelt they had some sort of function going on in the lobby so it was closed to guest. The lobby elevator button was even disconnected so you could not get to that floor at all. The only way into the hotel was in the back where the valet was, I think the hotel staff should have told guests that the main entrances would be locked all day. We would stay at the Roosevelt again if we were ever in the area. Bed was very comfortable.

<Content>Loved the Roosevelt What a great hotel.After reading some of the reviews on here i was a bit worried about going but as soon as we arrived we were treated really well.The Valet guys were really friendlly and the front desk girls were like supermodels (the 3 we saw anyway).The rooms are a bit dark and small but as we didn`t spend much time in them it was not a problem.The pool area is lovelly with a very big pool and plenty of sunbeds if you get down before noon.The food they serve at the pool is fantastic especially the salads and burgers.There are lots of gorgeous people parading around especially at weekends.The service we received and saw other people receive was fantastic so cant understand the people who compalin.The pool turns into a club at night and as long as you get your hand stamped by reception before 9 then all hotel guests are allowed access.We saw Mike Tyson the night we went there and the atmosphere was great with many people stripping off into their swimwear and swimming in the pool.Overall the hotel is great and would recommend but dont think it will be suitable for businessmen who want to get a good nights sleep or older couples as the hotel is a bit noisy and catered for people in their twenties.

<Content>birthday weekend i recently stayed at the hotel for my birthday weekend. i live in Los Angeles, but thought it would be nice to lay by the pool by day with friends and party by the pool by night. we had a great time. every one at the front desk was very nice. the concierge was helpful in booking us a last minute dinner reservation. and the pool staff did their job in taking care of us with drinks all day long. in fact a few of my friends came late to join and they found a place for everyone to sit together. looks like the staff really has a good time, which makes the guests want to have a good time. my only recommendation is try to book a room in the tower since there are very dark hallways and no ice machines on the cabana floors.

<Content>First Class Service at this Beautiful Hotel Absolutely magnificent! There is no other way to describe my weekend stay at this glorious property. Check out was such a sad occasion, as we did not want to leave.This Property is beautiful. It is old Hollywood glamor at its best. You half expect to see Marilyn Monroe walking past you in the halls. Old world style and grace is also reflected in the service; as everyone from the bellman, the valets, the front desk and poolside bartenders treated us like royalty.The concierge was amazing, and arranged a fabulous dinner and night club experience for my friend and I in 1 phone call. This was not simply a hotel. The Roosevelt is an experience. The only place to stay if you want to enjoy the best that LA has to offer.

<Content>Pleasant Surprise My daughter and I took a quick one-night trip to LA to see Wicked. Since we were only staying for one night, I used Priceline which came up with the Roosevelt Hotel. After reading many reviews of this hotel, I must admit that I had low expectations. The review comments that most stood out were small dark rooms and rude staff. I must say that my experience was very different. We arrived at noon, before check-in, but were treated very politely at the front desk. They advised that only one room with two beds was available, it was 'nice' and on the 8th floor, but was handicapped accessible. We decided to take the room and it was lovely. It had views of the Hollywood sign, the Chinese Theater and the Magic Castle. It was also quite large and bright. When we got to the room, we noticed that the shower had been used, a bathmat was on the floor and a towel was in the sink. I called housekeeping, they were very apologetic, and said it would be taken care of. We were not really bothered by this, and assume the room was cleaned while the previous guest was at the pool. (This happened to us once when we were at the pool and our room was cleaned early - we did tell the front desk upon checkout, but have no idea if they relayed the message to the housekeeping staff.) We left to do some shopping and have lunch, when we returned the room had been re-cleaned. The poolside bar/restaurant was really nice and since it was extremely hot, the staff was very obliging and moved an umbrella over to our table to provide shade. About the only negative comment is that there are no ice machines, and ice must be ordered from room service. After returning from the theater we really wanted ice water, so I called room service to ask how long it would take. I was assured that it would only be about 10 minutes, but after 45 minutes, we gave up and went to sleep. Next time, I would just go to the 24 hr. restaurant and ask for a glass of ice. Breakfast in the restaurant was also very good. Other comments on this site have mentioned that the pool area and bar are sometimes closed for private parties, but since we had no intention of using the pool at night, or going to the bar (since my daughter is too young) it was not an issue. All in all, it was a very wonderful experience and I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel Great Hotel, incredible location, Rooms and Housekeeping service is excellent. But make sure you get to the pool early in the morning if you want a lounger, there seems to be some kind of hierarchy as most are reserved for somebody other than the normal hotel guest. Also food and drinks are good once you can flag down the many servers that are about.

<Content>Chic but really loud at night This is a very chic hotel (consistent with the Thompson hotel properties in NYC). The rooms are elegantly understated with hardwood floors, platform bed, and miminalist design. I had a cabana room that overlooked the pool. During the day you will see many locals hanging around the pool or a production company shooting a commercial. Celebrity sightings are common here.At night, this pool area is quite the party scene. If you have any plans to sleep at night, don't stay at this hotel. Seriously. I am a heavy sleeper, but the noise was so loud, and it went on until at least 1 am, and this was on a Wednesday night!! So, if you are here on a business trip and need to be awake for an early morning meeting or to get to the airport, stay somewhere else.

<Content>good for the experience I was a bit nervous about staying here after reading some of the reviews on here, however our stay was great. I guess those with the loudest voices are complainers. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Free coffee was available by the pool from 8am - 10am, and it was wonderful sitting by the pool in the sun. The hotel is not outdated, it's a beautiful historic buidling...if you want a white box with windows, go stay at a chain hotel. It was a great Hollywood experience and I would stay again.

<Content>A great one night stay. I was very concerned after booking this hotel through Priceline that I had made a big mistake! Small rooms, poor service and noise seemed to be the general feeling coming from many reviewers. I was considering walking away from the reservation but in the end decided to 'chance' it.I was so glad I did, check in staff where friendly and efficient and after discovering it was our first time staying at the Roosevelt spent a good few minutes going through all the facilities that were on offer.After expecting a tiny room I was delighted with the corner room I was given on the 7th floor. It had two twin beds with very comfortable linens, very effective air conditioning and a great view towards downtown LA. The bathroom was not huge, however, it was fine for 1 night, there was also plenty of storage space in the closets in the small corridor as you entered the room. The mini-bar was well stocked however, the prices were extremely expensive. It was good to see that it wasn't one of those mini-bars were the slightest movement of an item causes a charge to be made. This meant it was possible to store a few beers and other items in there with no problem. The historic lobby is dark as had been stated previously however, it was like a calm oasis after battling through the heat and crowds on Hollywood Boulevard. It was also a great place to enjoy a few drinks before retiring as the pool bar is closed on Sunday evenings.I only had a brief opportunity to see the pool area on the Sunday afternoon of my stay, however it definitely had a 'vibe' about the place and was certainly full of 'beautiful' people. All in all it was a great 'Hollywood' experience for the end of my vacation and if people get the same treatment as I and my partner did I can whole-heartedly recommend this hotel.

<Content>People watching at its best Fabulous location. If you arrive via union station the red line subway (yes subway in LA) takes you to the intersection of Highland  Hollywood for $1.25. This beats the $28 parking fee.Rooms are remodeled  include coffee pot, hair dryer and irons. Beds  showers are good. My pet peeve is the $3.50 the hotel charges you for coffee packets (to make coffee in the room). But, there is free coffee poolside from 8-10 a.m.. The pool is heated. When we were there all of the unoccupied lounges were reserved and the pool guy told us we needed to make pool reservations like you do dinner reservations at a restaurant. Management de bunked this myth stating the lounges were available to guests on a first come first serve basis. The antic's of the pool crowd (average age is about 24) is well worth the effort of getting a seat. We set by valet from 11:30 - mid-night watching people come and go from the pool bar on a Saturday night. This was highly a entertaining activity. I will stay here again. I don't know where you get a bigger entertainment bang for your buck.

<Content>Historic Hollywood Meets Luxurious Fun Even if you live in Southern California, you shouldn't miss a chance to stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. The ambiance of the hotel makes the guest feel like a star - if only for the night. Every detail in our renovated room was perfect - the modern but comfortable furniture, the marble-clad bath, the view of Grauman's Chinese Theatre across the street. The room included great (and stylish) lighting for working at the desk or reading in bed. I loved the photos of movie stars lining the hallways and the sense of historic Hollywood. If only the walls could talk! The interiors of the hotel public rooms are amazing. You can sit in the library bar and marvel at all the intricate details in the woodwork, textiles and tile. It's a marvelous mix of different styles that echo the historic past and current scene that is the Hollywood. Best of all, and in spite of it's celebrity power, it isn't fussy. Check-in was professional yet friendly. You'll wait for your car at valet parking just like any popular spot but this doesn't diminish the fun of staying here. You are so distracted by the lux autos and the people driving them that it doesn't matter. Highly recommended for a true taste of Hollywood glamour!

<Content>Good location for me My son lives in the Hollywood Hills so my choice in staying at this hotel was based on proximity to his home. The hotel lobby is beautfiul. Valet service is excellent. There are two restaurants on site, one very casual and one upscale steak house. I did not use them. The library bar is nice for a nightcap. Friendly, timely service. The poolside bar has limited offerings and was not adequately staffed on our evening visit resulting in delays in service. The rooms are well priced for LA but compact. Noise was not an issue. Room service for coffee in the AM was prompt.There is some kind of very hip club on the premises that many try to get into in order to see a celebrity. Since I was visiting the biggest celebrity in my life, my son - I skipped that part.

<Content>Good hotel for the most part We stayed at the hotel mostly because of the buzz and the history of the place and found it to be nice, friendly if not occasionaly loud and busy. The dark of the lobby that others mention we didn't mind because of the hustle bustle of Hollywood Blvd and the L.A. heat...it was actually calming. Staff and front desk were attentive and friendly. Room was fine but certainly not historical. Pool area is beautiful but noisy and crazy on weekends...go mid week if you want to properly enjoy it. The location is the best so outside of a little noise and wait for your car, it is a good hotel for what it does. We would go back.

<Content>Great Hotel and Great Experience This is the place to stay in Hollywood. I read some scathing reviews and was prepared to walk if all was not in order (actually had a back up reservation across the street). We booked a pool view cabana room. We got a very nice sized room with an awesome king bed with great sheets. The room was dark but not uncomfortably so. The view of the pool and immediate access to the pool was nice. I can't imagine being in the tower rooms since so much of this hotel revolves around the pool and the Tropicana.  When we arrived the valet was courteous, check in efficient and the bellman superb giving us some hints. This was my girlfriend's birthday and all was in order. Oh yeah, we are not in our 20's, but late 40's, and we did not feel out of place at the pool. We made contact with a pool attendant Greg immediately, and made arrangements for specific lounge chairs by Hollywood's most popular pool. It helps if you are wiling to tip to get prime real estate by the pool, and want to sleep in. While the drinks and pool snacks are a little pricey hey it's a vacation relax and go with it. The pool becomes a nightclub at night with a line, but as a cabana guest you have access with no questions. it can be loud until about 1:20am, so be warned. Well worth stopping here for a drink on the way to your room The Library lobby bar is beautiful and serves up drinks in a more sedate atmosphere. While there you really should try Dakota for a high end steak dining experience. Excellent service and corkage for $20.00. Also try the killer hamburger and breakfast bar open 24 hours it is called 25 Degrees. The hotel walking distance to all the great places in Hollywood. We did the Magic Castle and Pantages (Wicked). The only bummer is we did not have time for Musso and Frank Grill. I am already thinking about booking another weekend here.

<Content>Worst hotel experience I have ever had My friend and I decided to go down to LA for a girls long weekend getaway. I had heard that the Roosevelt was a fun hotel providing a true LA experience, so we booked it. Worst hotel choice I have ever made. The nicest people at the hotel are those who don't actually work for the hotel -- i.e., the security and valet parking staff who are contracted out. We had booked our room through a very reputable travel website. After schlepping my suitcase down the stairs to the reception area with travel confirmation in hand, the front desk staff told us that the travel website had sent them different room preferences (we wanted 2 double beds, they had 1 king own for us) than those printed on my confirmation directly from the travel website. They told us it was not their fault and that they may change rooms for us as a favor. The room itself was decent except, for a very poorly designed half glass door fo the shower (saturating the bathroom floor) and the very VERY bright light outside the building that shined right into our room ALL NIGHT. This light was intended to light up the hotel, I guess. Very poor design and poor consideration for guests trying to sleep in those rooms. We didn't actually get moved until our last night. We also never received a bottle of wine or a call from the manager, as promised. The hotel staff and the concierge made us feel like we were lucky to even be allowed to stay at the hotel and that we were very low on the totum pole. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO DISRESPECTED AS HOTEL GUEST IN MY LIFE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY... YOU'LL PROBABLY GET BETTER TREATMENT AT A 2-STAR HOTEL.

<Content>don't make the same mistake we did... Where shall I begin... This hotel has the darkest, gloomiest hallways I've ever come across. We had to navigate our way through the maze of hallways to reach our sorry excuse of a room. Upon opening the door, we could barely fit our suitcases and when we looked up we were disturbed to find what seemed to be a painting of two serial killer women on acid. We immediately had to use our limited towel supply to cover up this monstrosity. From there, my girlfriend decided to take a shower and was pleased to find half of a glass shower door that left our floor sopping wet. Other than that, the bathroom resembled any typical shanty motel bathroom. Back to the room itself, it was as small as a closet AND this was a deluxe size room. The pool area itself was very nice and the highlight of the hotel. Had we only spent $100 a nite, we wouldn't have been as upset as we were. However, If you think you're going to get value for your dollar, think again. Please don't be fooled by the pictures because you'll be in for a rude awakening.

<Content>Full service hotel or private club? I've given an above average rating despite a mixed experience. The hotel and pool area are beautiful however the hotel needs to decide who it is serving. On check in we were advised that the pool was unavailable to guests as a commercial was being filmed! The room itself was much larger than expected and we had a nice view of Hollywood Boulevard. Free internet access was welcome. On day 2 we visited the pool about 4pm after a day out and were asked to move at around 5pm because a VIP private party was taking place beside the pool. We expressed concern but did go inside as the sun was going down. That evening we took the elevator to the ground floor to go out for dinner only to be prevented from walking through the main lobby because of another private event (this time a Prince concert).We complained to the duty manager about the way paying guests were being treated and she apologised and offered a complementary cocktailat the poolside bar. This meant we were escorted past the velvet ropeand for a short while joined the beautiful party people - sorry folksbut we sold out! Seriously the hotel can't keep both guests and visiting VIPs happy and needs to decide who it is serving.

<Content>Find somewhere else to stay I stayed at the Roosevelt in January for business, because I wanted something historic. This was honestly the worst hotel experience I have ever had.Once I actually got to the hotel (which is no small feat with all the traffic from the Kodak), I realized that I had to go downstairs (dragging suitcase) into a dark reception area. They told me to come back in about a half an hour to check in because they had no clean rooms (at their normal check in time).I eventually checked in and found the room to be small and the entire hotel to be dark and unwelcoming. My shower also leaked all over the floor, due to poor design, as opposed to a need for maintenance.On the second night I was there (a Tuesday, mind you), there was some sort of event going on. Parking was a major issue. Once I returned to the hotel, I realized the bass from whatever music was playing was so loud I could barely talk to the other people I was traveling with. My room was on the 4th floor and things in the room literally SHOOK from the vibrations from the music. I think I finally fell asleep out of sheer exhaustion at around 2 am.I tried changing hotels for the final 2 nights of my stay, but couldn't find anything....

<Content>hip trendy hotel suprisingly child friendly we arrived at this hotel with our 8 year old late at night just as a party for richard branson was finishing and immediatly thought our 8 year old would not be welcome at a such a trendy hotel,we were so wrong. upon check in we were given an upgrade as the reception thought we would need a bigger room as we were traveling with a child.this hotel is fab great looking and trendy and the staff are so friendly and welcoming .the location is fantastic located on the walk of fame ( two stars down from samuel l jackson) and opposite the chinese theatre. it has a great pool with a david hockney painting at the bottom and the food and restaurants are very good and well priced just like the hotel. the rooms are big have cd players and flat screen tv and plenty of famouse people lounging by the pool. i cannot recomend this hotel enough to everyone families teenagers older couples and honeymooners a fantastic great priced trendy child friendly hotel deffinatly deserves 5 stars and will make your trip to la the formal restaurant is fab and they did there best to accomadate are child.

<Content>Good location, good hotel This was our first stop before our honeymoon in Hawaii started. We stayed there three nights, just enough time to get used to West Coast/US time. The hotel was great, the staff very helpful, the food and drinks delicious. BUT, it was very, very noisy. You could hear everything in the rooms around you and we had the feeling a jazz band was playing in our room on our last night. Other than that, very entertaining stay.

<Content>In 2 Nights I Saw Jermaine Dupri, Jewel and Richard Branson I stayed at the hotel for two nights on July 1st and 2nd after staying at the Mondrian for one night. I got a great deal for the hotel and I was happy with the overall service I received. The bellman, and the front desk girls were very helpful and nice. They actually made a mistake on my bill but cleared it up right away and they apologized for their mistake. WARNING about the pool scene. Every one is young, pretty and in shape, not really a family venue, as it can be intimidating. I myself am in good shape but was surprised at how everyone looked poolside. I had a blast and met some great people while hanging out with my fiance. The party on Sunday at the pool during the day is VERY popular so get there by 10am or earlier otherwise you won't find a spot by the pool. They check to make sure you are a guest of the pool before you enter as well. The rooms are average size and a little on the dark side, but this is the ambience of the overall hotel. It is rumored to be haunted and I don't doubt that for a minute, its got that old hollywood feel to it. While there we saw producer JD at the Sunday pool party and the following night Richard Branson threw a fundraiser we saw him and Jewel at the hotel. Over all a pretty good experience but as a young couple we enjoyed the Mondrian a little more.

<Content>ikea knockoff heaven I was so excited to take my husband to this Hotel selected by bid on Priceline for Father's Day. I read the negative reviews , but kept hope that a four star hotel would be great , especially for one night.The room is sparcely decorated with Ikea look low flat peeling painted dark mahogany (mostly just brown) furniture (including the King bed). The rooms are quite dreary  the hallways very dark. The small TV is located on a small painted stand too far away from the bed for the size of the screen. The concrete bathroom floor is in need of much repair  black stain removal. The shower door covers only half of the tub, making for a very wet floor when you get out of the shower. I wondered why such an old ( supposedly historic) hotel would remodel the rooms and hallways as it did. Modern day bad Ikea. The main lobby  check in floor (they are seperate) give the impression of great  elegant things to come. The main lobby is extremely dark. The 24 hour eatery , too, is dark. You are greeted by a glued on menu on a table that indicates that this is just a burger joint with no prices listed except for $1.50 for extra cheese.There is no self parking, so don't forget anything  have to run back to your room. You will have to turn your keys over to the Valet  wait for your car to be returned after the few minutes it took for you to get what you wanted. You must pay for overnight parking too @$28.00. I apologized to my husband.

<Content>Awful, awful, awful!! Stayed for 3 nights - final stop on a great honeymoon, on the way back to the UK from Fiji. Chose the hotel because we were expecting a little bit of Old-Hollywood chic, and because of it's central location.Room was tiny by American standards. Particularly the bathroom which more closely resembled one from a Japanese capsule hotel. Room was decorated with a frankly disgusting large canvas photograph. Walls were paper-thin (we could hear conversations in the room next door), bed and pillows weren't particularly comfortable (and my partner swears there was bed bugs due to the mysterious bites she kept waking up with), though the TV had a good selection of channels.The hotel istself is so dark and dingy. Even with blazing sunshine outside, it's very gloomy in the lobby. It's also very noisy and busy; there always seemed to be something happening. The doors are also patrolled by angry doorman, who on more than one occasion prevented me entrance into my own hotel! It felt like tryng to get into a trendy nightclub at times.Worst experience by far was on our last night (hoping to get a good night's sleep in preperation for an 11 hour flight!). Having played host to a high-school prom, the hotel obviously allowed a load of the recent graduates to rent rooms. Cue a night of screaming, banging, singing, running around corridors, etc. I've stayed in numerous hotels around the world, and never experienced noise like it. Even my university halls were quieter. At 3am, I finally caved and rang the front-desk. The phone rang for 5 minutes before finally being picked up - We'll send someone right up sir - which of course they didn't. It got to 4am when I eventually went out into the corridor myself to try and reason with them. In fairness, they did start to quiten down, but it was a draining and restless night to say the least.Ironically, despite the dark gloom of the main hotel, the rooms are suprisingly and dissapointingly bright at night. A combination of the cheap curtains, and the fact a spotlight shines directly at the windows... used to highlight a 50-foot high fashion advetrtisment emblazoned on the side of the building. That, in itself sums up the general cheap and tacky feel of this hotel.A hotel with a great legacy destroyed by pretentious owners. Avoid like the plague.

<Content>multiple personality disorder service We booked a room at the Roosevelt for a girl's night out in Hollywood. I have to say that the service resembled a person with multiple personality disorder. The valet  check in were more than polite, they were both extremely nice. Our towel boy and server during the day at the pool were outstanding. However! At 11 am there were no chairs available around the pool (the hotel allows locals to come use the pool without checking keys, i know because i am local and i have friends who do this). So we were relgated to a sectional couch at the back, a nice spot but unfortunately shady. At 4 pm we were informed our section was going to be cordoned off for VIP and that we would have to move. This was after spending the afternoon and $300+ from the bar/restaurant. The staff was informed if they could find us seats around the pool sitting together we would move, but that aside we weren't leaving until 5. They left us alone for the most part after that.Going back up to our hotel room to ready ourselves for dinner, one of my friends brought a beautiful bottle of champagne for us to drink while doing so. Calling room service I was told they would not send us up flutes or even wine glasses, but we could call the pool and they might send us up some plastic flutes. (WHATever). The pool sent up plastic beer cups. Um, NO! I sent the poor man back downstairs for either plastic flutes or glass glasses. The thoughts of my friend in terms of service versus labor cost, they had to endure 3 phone calls and 2 trips on the part of the server to finally send us up glass wine glasses. If they had done it the first time, it would have been far less hassle in terms of time and money. Either way you slice it, it's ridiculous.I do have to say that the room and our view was gorgeous, they supplied is with Fresh brand amenities (my personal favorite), the sheets and towels were all top quality (even though some of the towels had a Ritz-Calrton label) and we had a wonderful time. This hotel needs to offer in the way of service what it can offer in the way of fun. And it would be nothing more simple than common consideration and even just attending to the most simplistic of requests.

<Content>BEWARE! Aren't hotels supposed to make you feel WELCOMED? The Reader's Digest version: BAD SERVICE, DARK, OBNOXIOUS, PRETENTIOUS. JUST HEAD TO THE VICEROY SANTA MONICA FOR A BETTER TAKE ON HIP LUXURY.The long, whiny version: I live in Laurel Canyon and booked the Roosevelt for a girl's night out at Teddy's and a hotel stay while my friend was visiting from Seattle. I even called to make sure that Teddy's would be open and that we, as hotel guests, would be able to get in to the famously hard-to-get-into club. After being downgraded to a dumpy dark room with a view of the airconditioners upon check-in (the $350 room we booked a month prior was no longer available because we were trying to check in after 3:00 PM -- it was 3:30), we found out Teddy's wasn't even open that night, there was a really obnoxious, frat-style 20-something party going on at the pool (which required a neon green wristband) we could attend up until 6:00, but then even the front desk people could not tell us if we'd be able to get into our own hotel pool after 6:00 PM that night. None of this was ever communicated when I booked it. Let's just say the Roosevelt is all about making you feel excluded. We were there one hour and checked out and headed to the Viceroy in Santa Monica. So happy we did. THE VICEROY WAS PERFECT! Hip for people over 25. Gorgeous, fresh, bright, fun decor and great service! Great margies, too.

<Content>Pretty much Evrything that You Read About this Place is True I booked this place through quikbook and got a great deal. We arrivedat around 10 PM on a Saturday Night! I too was going to cancel my reservations after reading some of the negative comments. Here are the facts; If you are a guest, you will always be able to have your car parked here whether or not the lot is closed for non-guests. The staff here is very friendly and accomodating, (with no attitude).Since it was a warm Satuturday Evening, the Pool party was in full swing. The pool area was busy but not rowdy. We had a cabana room with a King Sized Bed that was facing the street so it was quiet. Youneed a key card to access the hallways of the hotel, so the room areas were very quiet, (even near the cabana). The rooms of the hotel are very dark. I needed a flashlight to see the thermostat! My room was decent sized but only had one small bench to sit on. I also did not like the fact that I needed to call room service if I wanted some ice because there are no ice machines for guests of this hotel.To be honest, this is not my kind of hotel, (I later stayed at the Century City Intercontinental) but I have no major complaints.If I got a good deal, I would stay here again.

<Content>Hurry Up and Wait at the Roosevelt The Roosevelt is known for being a bit of a Hollywood scene (or at least it was a year ago) which does not interest me, so I wouldn't have stayed there had it not been for a good deal through a business associate. But I was intrigued to see the property.First of all, arrival is a nightmare. The valets were so behind on a Saturday afternoon that traffic was backed up all the way down the side street next to the hotel. After waiting for a minute I swung around and parked on Hollywood Boulevard. The line at reception was 20 people long, and took forever -- one gets the feeling the young women working the desk were not hired for their brilliant interpersonal skills.Over to the elevator, and there's a crowd there as well. One of the two elevators is broken, and people are waiting up to a half hour for a lift. Finally making it to the room, and yes, it's nice -- due to a problem with the reservation I've had to get a nicer room (long storyand not the hotel's fault), and it's quite the space -- two bathrooms, a sitting area, all very well designed, a step up from thecheese-modern Standard. But then I open up the laptop to get some work done and the complimentary WiFi is barely functional -- a website takes 5 or 10 minutes to load, if it loads at all. It was like that all weekend.I went to check out the fitness center, but even though it was mid-afternoon, it seemed closed, and very small. The party scene around the pool was amusing (if a little crowded for someone just interestedin a swim). Every girl was a Hollywood proto-starlet, every guy was a steroid-enhanced dude in a baseball cap. Getting my car back, even though it was parked right there in the parking lot, was a nightmare -- a line for the valet window, then a giant crowd of angry people outside, and it took about 45 minutes. I learned quickly to avoid Hollywood Boulevard which was always snarled with traffic, and just walking to the Hollywood and Highland mall to buy a swimsuit was a challenge. Again, the room itself was lovely, with a large bed and a great shower with nice soaps and stuff. Rowdiness on lower floors (and especially around the pool) seemed like it would have been a nightmare for anyone wanting to sleep, but I didn't have a noise problem, other than the deafeningly loud fan that I couldn't figure out how to shut off until I called the front desk the next day (hint: it was the giant switch in the circuit breaker). So, if I was paying full price, I'd never, ever stay here again. While the infrastructure and design is nice, the service level is nonexistent, and every aspect of the hotel is geared towards a scene not a happy traveler.

<Content>Big room, nice stop over Have just stayed in this hotel on a stop over back from New Zealand, We had interconnecting rooms which was important as we were travelling with our 3 children. Our room was large with 2 double bedsand a unusually big bathroom, however my childrens bedroom was smaller with the same beds in it including an extra single bed and the bathroom was tiny? Nice view of lower roof and air con units!The restaurant was very expensive but there are plenty of diners on Sunset but the hotels diner was a little more reasonable and we ate breakfast there on one of our mornings. (bottomless coffee!)The staff were friendly but on a couple of calls from our room to the front desk they were unhelpful and put us through to other deptments?The pool was lovely and warm (outside) and pool bar service was good, very busy and hard to get a bed in the sun but my kids spent all the time in the water so not too much of a prob! (in the eves the pool has a more adult scene! (Say no more)This hotel was very exclusive, probally a little too posh for me and my family as we felt a little out of place at times. (no fault of thehotel)Good location as you only have to step out of door to Sunset Strip beware of characters outside cinema, they are good fun but want a tip if you photograph them!Would stay again but only for stopover!

<Content>A Great Unique Place My wife and stayed here May 14th-18, and loved just about everything about it. We pulled up in our rental car and saw there was a Ferrari and a Bently in front of us at the Valet. ($28 a day though) We tried to checkin at 3 which is their checkin time, but they werent ready. They offerred us a smaller room, but we waited till 4:30 by the pool for our room. (I usually would have asked to see the manager for an upgrade, but i argue for a living, and didnt feel like getting started on my vacation). The front desk was nice, but maybe a lil snobbish, but that could just be hollywood. The Valet, Doormen, Maids, and Bellboys always said hello and had a smile on their face. We stayed on the 10th floor and had a pretty nice room. The bed was very comfortable, but the TV was about 10 years old, but we werent there to watch TV. I think on alot of the rooms, they converted 2 rooms into one large one because it was a somewhat strange layout, but it was a large room. The location is absolutely perfect for everythig in hollywood, restaurants, shops, tours, bars. Its all right outside the frontdoor, or even inside the hotel. The pool was gorgeous. Never had a problem getting a lounge. Drinks were very expsnsive there, so we went to the store down the street and bought a 12 pack and brought that but we didnt see anyone else doing that because everyone else there seemed to have no budget. The Dakota restaurant inside was very good, a lil pricey but we enjoyed the experience. The burger place was also a lil pricey, but it was the best darn burger i have had at a restaurant. Teh hotel is a lil bit older, so we did hear quite of bit of hall noice in our room.

<Content>Hotel staffs are bunch of posers It was the worst hotel experience we had. We traveled a lot and only stayed at great hotels. I thought for the amount of money they charged and the location, it can't go bad. So wrong! Hotel staffs were rude, unhelpful, had no idea of what they were doing. Concierge was too busy booking her own gigs and told us that she had no time to help us. Front desk missed our wake up calls and could not find a package that was sent to us. Cracks at the bathroom wall. Loud noises from the hallway at 3 am in the morning. Should I go on? Pelnty of nice hotels in the area, never stay here!!

<Content>Great Hotel, but sleazy billing department... Check your bill!! We loved the hotel and took full advantage of the wonderful ambiance- lunches for four and numerous rounds of drinks by the fab pool, room service, etc.... so we were expecting quite a large bill. We didn't expect being double billed for the lovely room and while rushing to the airport, we hadn't noticed until reviewing the bill in the car.Numerous calls to the hotel to address the situation have resulted in no return phone calls.Great hotel, but not at twice the room rate that we were expecting and quite horrible customer service in our attempts to rectify it. It put a huge damper on an otherwise wonderful stay- and we were planning to return often, as our son has moved to LA. There are other hotels...we'll be finding them.

<Content>Fab Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Roosevelt in December 2005 for the first 3 days of our honeymoon. I can honestly say that i am quite shocked at some of the negative comments written about this hotel. We could not fault it in any way. We had a fab room which we were upgraded to, the reception staff were great, really friendly - once they knew we had just got married in Las Vegas they insisted on upgrading us! They were really friendly and helpful.The hotel itself was lovely, very trendy, and we really got the feeling that we chose the best hotel to stay in Hollywood. There was a real buzz about the place.The only thing that was a little dissapointing was the fact that for two days of our stay the pool area was closed off, because there was some celebrity resident - but hey we were in LA baby!!! It all added to the atmosphere of this wonderful hotel, right in the heart of Hollywood! Please stay here... FAB!

<Content>Great Girls Getaway I almost switched hotels after reading some of the reviews. I really wanted to stay somewhere that was part of the scene for a girls' weekend in L.A., but got nervous after reading the negative comments. Once we got there, however, I was glad I stuck with my original choice. The hotel had great ambiance. I loved the cavernous effect with the dark hallways and low lighting. It made it feel like old Hollywood, but with a modern twist. The crowd was a good mix of young privileged partyers and wealthy grown-ups and there were a few events going on that made us feel as though we were at the place to be. The staff was excellent; very friendly and accommodating. Our room was quirky with the bathroom through the closet, but the beds were cozy and it was plenty of room for three of us. The rooms didn't have the level of luxury that you might find at hotels going for this rate in other cities like The Omni in San Diego, but in L.A., this is what you get for the money; clean, comfortable, hip and right smack in the middle of everything. I can't wait to go back and spend some time by the pool, which was great for people watching, (and for good food and drinks).

<Content>Overall good hotel! We were scared when we read all the reviews of the Roosevelt - this hotel is defintely a party hotel - but we liked it overall -we stayed in 2 Cabana rooms - one facing the Tropicana Bar and the other facing the street - the Tropicana bar is open daily until 2am and so if you do not like noise, do not stay in one of these! The Cabana room facing the street was fine in terms of noise..Staff was really friendly and helpful. The concierge booked us a great tour of the hollywood homes and also got us into Spago's- which was AMAZING -Overall - the hotel has a really nice atmosphere- very dark - but the lobby is all lit up with candles - its very nice - the Cabana rooms were nice and the toiletries were amazing. The 25 degrees restaurant was actually very good - we didn't eat burgers but we had grilled cheese and other things and it was good.Overall we were very hapy with the hotel - it was clean, people were friendly and we had a good time.

<Content>loved this place my wife and I spent 5 nights at the Roosevelt in match 2007.We were worried because we had read some negative comments, but wondered what the hell the people were on about when we got there.Check in went smoothly and the staff were very friendly and helpfull, from check in, to the concierge, to getting an iron delivered to our room.Room was on 13th floor, was agreat size with a great bathroom and the most comfy bed we have ever slept in.Had great view from our room looking over chinese theatre and the hollywood sign.Everything is on your doorstep, from in and out burgers, yum, to a myriad great restaurants, and the best discount shoe shop in LA just one block behind the hotel.would recommend staying here to anyone.

<Content>Very good, but not a World beater I just spent five nights in a Studio Suite on the tenth floor of the Roosevelt. It cost around $370 per night. I was there on business, so the first thing I wanted to do was go online, but the wi-fi in the room wasn't particularly dependable.So I settled into what was a fairly well-appointed room. Two bathrooms, a very comfartable bed, lounge space with a sofa separated from the bed by a wooden screen.The room was quiet, but luckily the poolside bar was buzzy, if pricey. I've partied at the Standard on the Sunset Strip before, but the Roosevelt apparently now rivals it as one of the spots to head for in Hollywood. Paris and Lindsay weren't about, but there was a decent atmosphere and a smattering of poseurs. Because of that, don't stay in one of the surrounding Cabana rooms if you want to get any sleep.Room service was prompt, friendly and efficient, as were the front desk staff. Taxis wait on the street so you don't have to and I can't comment on the restaurants as I didn't use them.

<Content>Stayed here a while ago... was a little bit disapointed I haven't stayed here in a while, but I did a couple years ago and was sort of disappointed. The hotel itself has an incredible history (with the Academy Awards having been here for many years) and its fun to just drop by the hotel lobby and walk around or get a cocktail at the lobby bar and soak up the atmosphere. But when I stayed here one night, I was given a room out by the pool. The room was not very clean and the pool area was noisy (partiers walking out there late into the night). It is a beautiful hotel on the exterior, but I was underwhelmed by this bare bones hotel room. The sheets were itchy. Don't know why. Didn't sleep well. I expected a romantic, old fashioned Hollywood Inn that had that 30s-40s retro feel with very clean rooms. Instead it was more of the kind of party room you would get in Palm Springs near the pool area of a small to midsize hotel during Spring Break. I'm sure the hotel probably has other rooms that are more what I was thinking of. But I was slightly disappointed anyway. The hotel restaurant has ugly decor that looks like something someone's grandmother picked out. Not retro and not period style, like it should have. Food was over-priced and mediocre. They need to develop the lobby bar area into a more user-friendly part of the hotel. It's too small. They should spritz up the outside of the hotel with fresh paint and some cool old-style awnings. Class it up a bit. And retro-fy the rooms back to the old style.

<Content>Love the Roosevelt My Mother and I stayed at the Roosevelt March 3-6. We absolutely loved it! Check-in went smoothly and we had no problem with the girls at check-in. They were helpful and friendly. We were suppossed to have a cabana room but there was some confusion with our reservation and our room was given away. We were accomodated with a room on the 12th floor overlooking Graumans Chinese Theater with the hollywood sign in the background. I definately recommend it. We couldn't have asked for better. The room we had was big and we loved the decor. The old lobby is dark but I agree that it adds to the mystique and style of the hotel. We ate at 25 degrees a couple times and LOVED it. Make sure to eat there. It is a bit pricey but worth the money for the best burger I have ever had. We were staying in the hotel during the premier for the movie 300, which was at Graumans. It was exciting to watch the red carpet from our room. The post-premier party was at our hotel on the old lobby floor. They were setting up for most of the day and shut off access from the elevators to this floor. That was a bit of a pain but that's the Roosevelt. Staying at the roosevelt you just have to understand that a lot of events are held there.The pool area and tropicana bar are beautiful. I am sure the cabana rooms and great to stay in too.

<Content>Loved it! Will stay again! My husband and I stayed for nights and loved it. We got the Cabana Room Balcony which overlooked the pool and Tropicana Bar. We booked directly and paid $259 + valet. Unsure if it is a good deal but after staying in New York hotels, we were happy with the price. We found the room modern and tastefully decorated. It was large too. Plasma tv was small but suffice. Toiletries from Fresh (Paris) and cookies on the turndown service was a nice touch. The hotel lounge and lobby dark but adds to the seductive and sophisticted atmosphere. Beautiful Chesterfield chairs and lounges, and leather papasan chairs! We loved the decor even though other reviewers have found it depressing. The staff were really friendly and helpful in a waiter in the dining rooms in particular, was charming! We had a wonderful breakfast one morning. A bit pricey but you have to treat yourself sometimes! The servings are generous anyway. I recommend the pineapple roasted french toast!Tropicana Bar was dead and perhaps is so on weekdays. Too bad the weather was not warm enough to have a swim as they have a fantastic pool. While we were there, CSI Miami was being filmed in the pool area. We snuck a peek and was tempted to run down and ask for autographs!Could not ask for a better location! The Chinese Mann's Theater is right accross the street and there is a shopping mall with several restaurants. The pharmacy around the corner (to the left and across the street) has some groceries. If you want a cheap meal, we went to across the street one morning to Shelly's Diner for breakfast, where they shot Million Dollar Baby.

<Content>Party here, but don't stay here! Just got back from an overnight trip to LA to see Wicked at the Pantages. Luckily the play and theater were great, because the hotel was NOT.To sum it up --- the Hollywood Roosevelt is a 4 star location to hang out, drink at the bars, eat at the restaurants, and do some celebrity sighting, but it is a 2 star hotel when it comes to room quality.Our room was TINY! The rooms I stayed at in hotels in Europe were MUCH larger.They need to bite the bullet, and half the number of rooms at the hotel, but knocking down walls and combining two rooms into one.They had to shave the bathroom door down to get it to swing past the toilet. There were no sheets on the bed. The carpet in the hallways was musty and wet. The decor in the room was depressing and strange. I don't really enjoy looking at a huge fisheye view of an androgenous 70's glam rocker staring at me when I'm supposed to be on a romantic night out.The dark look in the lobby, restaurant, etc.. works. It doesn't work in the room. This place needs a serious makeover.I got my room on priceline, but I still think I overpaid. I would not pay over $100 a night for this place.It IS in a great location though. Across the street from Mann's Chinese theater and the Kodak Theater and shopping centers. You can walk out the front door onto the Hollywood walk of fame and other Hollywood tourist attractions.

<Content>Nice hotel! We stayed 2 nights Feb 20-22. Price awesome on Priceline!The hotel staff were all very nice and soooo helpful. The girls at the front desk were very pleasant which was a nice change from other hotels. Andrea, the concierge, was also great and she actually seemed to want to help and was always smiling. She recommended a restaurant Bella's which was down the road from the Roosevelt. It was Italian and me being Italian I was a little nervous b/c it was right on Hollywood Boulevard, I was thinking tourist trap. But it was really good and the prices were reasonable. So thanks Andrea on that call.The lobby and the halls were very dark like other reviewers have stated but it wasn't bad, it just seemed swanky to me. The elevators sucked though, they took forever (but no big deal, we were on vacation). One night all the keys didn't work in the whole hotel but the staff were very helpful and apologetic so it wasn't that big a deal. They had a glitch in their electronic system.Rooms were fine, no complaints other then sink leaking in bathroom. Beds comfy and rooms were big enough for us. Wi-Fi fine from where we were in our room (408). Not much to talk about, just a normal room, nothing over the top!No ghost stories here, even though I was freaked out before we went from reading other stories. I just was scared a little when I heard any noise. But my son (who we didn't tell that it was haunted) told me that in the middle of the night, on his way back from the bathroom he thought I was standing by the tv but then realized I wasn't standing there. That freaked me out just a bit so who knows!!!Bars at the hotel were okay but VERY expensive---2 drinks $27.00 (and they were not big at all, a couple sips you're done)!!!! We tried to get into Teddy's (where the celebs go) and the girl at the door was verrrrrryyyyyyyy mean and just looked at us like we weren't there. The guy said it was for Guests and reservations only! We asked about reservations and he said they need to be made 2 weeks in advance which I'm sure is a lie. The fact is if you are not a celeb or millionaire you aren't getting in! Tropicana Bar was dead, not too many people there but I hear it becomes one of the hot spots during the summer. It was pretty nice there with the pool and some fire pits (I suggest bringing your own drinks in if you could, because atmosphere was cool and no one where you walk in so you can save yourself a buck making the drink in your hotel room first then just hanging out there).

<Content>Great Location! Would definitely stay again! Great Location! Would definitely stay again!My husband and I were very pleased with this hotel. The best part about it was definitely the location. It鈥檚 right on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. As soon as you walk out the front door you see the stars on the sidewalk. It鈥檚 also steps away from the Chinese Theatre and the Kodak Theatre, where you can see a great view of the Hollywood sign. There鈥檚 a lot of good shopping and restaurants nearby too. If the main point of your trip is to see Hollywood, you probably wouldn鈥檛 even need a car (and could avoid the steep price for valet). Jimmy Kimmel Live is filmed right down the street and they give away free tickets when you walk by.The hotel itself is obviously very old, but has undergone several renovations. The rooms are decorated very modern with unique artwork. I guess because the hotel was built so long ago the layout was a little strange 鈥?you had to walk through the closet to get to the bathroom. The bathroom was very small but was sufficient. There was little furniture in the actual room 鈥?you either sat on the bed or on the one desk chair. There were two big windows which made the room look bright and cheery. One small annoyance was that our room faced Hollywood high school and the band was practicing on our first night, but it wasn鈥檛 too bothersome. The only thing I would say needed improvement in the room was the bed linens or actually lack of linens. It might sound petty to some but there was no top sheet on the bed and the comforter had a couple stains.Apparently there are several stories of ghosts at this hotel but luckily (or unluckily depending on your viewpoint) we didn鈥檛 run into any! The lobby is extremely dim with candles lit all around giving it a somewhat spooky feeling (especially if you read the ghost stories before you go!). I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Hollywood who wants to be in the heart of it all! We booked our room on a name your own price website and got a great deal (I was shocked it was accepted!). I鈥檓 not sure the rooms are worth the actual prices I鈥檝e seen on other websites ($200-$250) so I would check around for the best price before booking!

<Content>Ikea meets simulated mahogany Our stay was for January 19, 2007 for one night. I booked the hotel through Priceline with a accepted bid of $75.00 + tax = $93.41 We arrive just before midnight and used the valet parking $38.00 as there is no self parking. Check in was fast.  Yes, it is a old hotel and updated as their website states however, I found the room to be very depressing. Ikea meets simulated Mahogany......... and who knew there were so many shades of brown. If I had paid full price for this hotel I would have been more depressed. The hotel served it鈥檚 purpose. We had a late flight from Boston to LA and we needed a hotel in LA for one night before continuing on to Laguna.

<Content>awful celebrity flophouse I arrived at the Roosevelt with great anticipation. I was staying there on business and was promised that it was THE place to stay in Hollywood. I guess if you're a 21-year-old celebrity wannabe, the numerous discomforts wouldn't deter you. In no particular order, here are my complaints:*hard-to-navigate entrance with numerous steps to the reception desk*completely inept posers at the reception desk*waited hours after the normal check-in time for our rooms*common areas so dark you think you're in a cave--even in daytime*run-down room with worn-out, unglued carpeting, sloppily dripped paint on the walls, cheap furnishings, and zero charm*scary back hallway in room (my coworker had this too, and he's a large, generally fearless guy) that made me feel as if I had to check all the hiding places every time I returned to the room*drunk person asleep in front of my door at 1 am

<Content>Cool place The Roosevelt Los Angeles is not your typical American style chain hotel. Dark and mysterious. My room on the third floor was a little depressing but I promptly upgraded to a room on the 11th floor with a nice city view. The staff was extremely friendly and attractive. There is a similar, less expensive hotel in downtown Los Angeles called The Figueroa.

<Content>Pleasantly suprised We stayed at the Roosevelt from the 1st Jan - 6th Jan and were tempted to change our booking based on the number of bad reviews we read. However we are certainly glad we didn't! Yes the hotel is dark but it is part of it's ambience, and its unique interior design set it apart from the numerous other hotels were it not for a name would be almost interchangable. From the begining we got a good feeling, the bell boy was friendly, chatty and very informative. Our room was clean and reasonably spacious, and when we did have a plumbing issue in the bathroom the staff were polite, helpful and prompt. We had breakfast at Dakota most mornings and again found the staff to be great and the food delicious. The location is superb and you are as central as possible most of the must see LA. While I could see it would probably not be an ideal choice for people with a younger family, my husband and I both loved our stay there and would most definately stay there again if in LA.

<Content>Great Hotel, Poor Staff Checked in on the 30th for 3 nights. We really excited about celebrating the NYE here as we had received information from the Hotel the party would be massive. Anyway, upon check in we had to change room as the twin room was tiny - small enough you could not swing a cat and there was mould in the bathroom. They showed us another room which again was very small and again complained. We later received an upgraded room which was an extra $75.00 a night, and considering the bigger room etc we did not mind paying this. We then thought as we had not booked direct with the hotel and had paid vast cheaper rates that are why they tried to fob us off with a small, dingy dark room. Anyway, the staff was very relaxed and like most state on here are only there to help the real celebrities. However, the bar staff at the Tropicana Bar were lovely and this is where we spent most of our time. Drinks are a little over priced, but you are in the middle of Hollywood and the view from our room could not be better. As we opened the curtains what do we look at - nothing but the Hollywood sign. I had also been advised that the tickets for the NYE party were going to be $50.00 we nearly got charged $100 but got that down to $75.00 and since I have sent them the email confirming we would be charged $50.00 and since had the refund. Check your bill throughly upon departure.Due to the downs there were all the ups too and we did spot a celebrity or 2 here, but don't expect to get near to Teddy's - A listers only and you would be lucky even to find the entrance. One last thing, it is true that there are the ghosts of the Roosevelt Hotel, try standing in the Blossom Room in the dark on your own - you will soon realise it is true!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Embarassingly horrible experience. Went to the Hollywood Roosevelt for New Year's at the Dakota restaurant. They advertized a spectacular prix fixed dinner on New Year's Eve and we were told that the price was $100.00 per person. When we arrived, we were warned by the parking valet that 1000 people were expected to show for the huge party and that the night might not be as expected since we were a couple in our fifties. We explained that we had to access our dinner reservations and gave up the car. The spectacular dinner was a tiny appetizer that could easily fit on one forkful. The waitress said it was foie gras but I am very familar with foie gras and the appetizer I ate was only pate'. My date had soup which was the only decent appetizer on the menu. For the main course, the menu said that one choice was a 2 1/2 half pound lobster out of the shell. Again, the portion was only 2 or 3 forkfuls with no vegetable or potatoe or salad. My date's dinner was 2 tiny lamb chops undercooked with no sides. We were both very hungry when dinner was over and ate the desert which we normally pass on. We each ordered only one glass of wine during dinner and when the bill was presented, it was $550.00. We questioned the manager on such a gross discrepancy of what we expected and we were told that there must have been a miscommunication as dinner was $200.00 per person and an $85.00 gratuity was included in the total cost. I was so embarrassed for my date who was visibly upset but being the gentleman he is, paid the bill without contest. He did tell the manager that the dinner was certainly not worthy of 200.00 but she just shrugged her shoulders. We then went to the party at the pool. Amazingly, the door man let us in but for the dozens of young people in line behind us who paid $100.00 just to get into the party (that offerred a fee for service bar), the dorrman told all of them that the party was filled to capacity and he couldn't allow any more bodies in there. People began to loudly protest, but the doorman just shrugged and said, Sue me. The blatant disregard for custormer service, the grossly unacceptable dinner, and the exhorbitant fees connected with this evening should be a warning to anyone who is even considering dining, visiting, or staying at this hotel.

<Content>Smitten by the Roosevelt Stayed at the Roosevelt in a Cabana room for five evenings in late November. Generally, a very jolly experience -- our room had a patio which opened onto a lushly landscaped pool area which has (at least for a New Yorker) a snazzy Hollywood kind of atmosphere. The historic rooms on the main floor are architecturally striking -- and for us, at least, the dark lighting enhanced the hotel's overall

<Content>Roosevelt, home of the stars and expensive bars We checked into the Roosevelt on Friday for a little RR. I was excited to be back at the Roosevelt as we had stayed there before, and had a great time. I had requested one of the Cabana rooms, which are the ones by the pool that allow access to the Tropicana Bar, one of the LA hotspots. We were a little dissapointed to have missed the Victoria Secret Party the night before, but still kept our spirits up with a couple of cocktails from the bar ($26 plus tips for two bloddy marys). Our room was super deluxe with a great patio next to the pool, the corner spot was secluded enough that we didn't feel like we were in a fish bowl. Rooms service and maid service were prompt and attentive, and for a change they really won't disturb you if you leave the Do Not Disturb sign on your door, a variance from most hotels where maid staff take it to mean knock really softly. The action at the pool bar was less than we could have hoped (we heard that the summer months the place is packed) but it was nice for a couple of drinks before heading out. We ended up staying an extra day we were having so much fun...I would reccomend the Roosevelt to anyone visiting LA who wants to play movie star for the weekend, just be ready to pay movie star bills as well. The room was about 500 per night with taxes, and drinks were pricey as well.

<Content>are you kidding This hotel is so dark and dreary--they should be paying you to stay there. I am a travel agent and recently stayed here for one evening to see the Lion King down the street. First, you arrive by the back door because the front door is normally blocked off because something or someone is across the street at the Kodak (Jay-Z) on my trip. You had to walk down into a real dark reception area to get signed in. The employees are okay but not so smart--I was told that Sunset Blvd was blocked off for the Hollywood Christmas Parade (Five days later).The rooms are also dark. Sink cracked, no top sheet, and in the Honor Bar they sell something called the Shag Bag-contains condoms and wipes--that pretty much sums up this hotel--

<Content>Going downhill fast Stayed here in 2005 and although the pool was closed for renovations, we had a nice room overlooking the theatre and felt the ambiance of Hollywood and the price was ok. So we went back again in 2006. We love Hollywood. Or did.Even paid for a Cabana room with a garden view thinking it would be even nicer.Much higher prices too. What a total disaster. The Cabana room was like the black hole of Calcutta. Drab, dark and musty. And the so called Garden had 3 plant pots and a lounger in a 10' x 10' area. The whole place had changed due to new owners. No Charlie Chaplin sitting at the entrance. The restaurant had changed also. The breakfast ho hum. The only thing we enjoyed was the hospitality of the Kiwi girl.I feel sorry for anyone who goes to the Roosevelt expecting to feel like a film star. If you want to stroll across the road to the theatre and Highland on Hollywood then where else can you stay so close. But if you want to enjoy everything about your trip stay somewhere else. We will.

<Content>Refreshingly different. I loved this hotel!I stayed for business and found the trendy decor and large plush rooms a pleasure to come back to after a long day. This is not your cookie cutter hotel . It offers cosy duvet's on the bed and W style decor but rooms that are double the size.High service touches included gourmet cookies provided with turndown and each morning providing an East Coast paper for this East Coast Resident (the New York Times). I was reluctant to stay at the hotel given some negative reviews but had no choice as other hotels were booked out. I'm so glad I stayed and shall definitely return.

<Content>Don't Stay at the Roosevelt!!!!!!!! The bell person, Elmo, who was the best part of the stay because of his courtesy, assured me that the hotel had spent in excess of $30M on renovations. I could not understand where this money had been spent. I have stayed in better Motel 6 rooms. I may have been spoiled after just spending several nights at the Westgate in San Diego before checking into this hotel. By the way, when in San Diego, stay at the Westgate--very classy with very courteous and attentive staff. Back to the Roosevelt--save your money and time. There are numerous other hotels within walking distance that appear to be much better. I was completely disappointed and disillusioned by my stay. Stay away!!!! The Roosevelt is a dump!!!!!

<Author>glamourpuss1000
<Content>Excellent all round We stayed here for 4 nights as a friend recommended it, we found a great deal on a website and paid for the basic room.On arrival we were upgraded to a Cabana Room, I can only describe it as fabulous.You are given a typed sheet of instructions to tell you the dress code for the Tropicana Bar and the admittance policy and the dates during your stay when certain areas of the hotel are closed eg lobby closed for MTV party, that sort of thing. Also on returning at night we had to go past about 5 security people to get to our room but such security is commendable in this day and age.The staff are all very pleasant, the pool is beautiful, they serve complimentary coffee there in the mornings.The restaurant and burger bar look great but as we were in Hollywood we wanted to eat out and about and particularly in the Hamburger Hamlet , only a few doors away, which if you sit in the window is the best location for people watching.Toiletries in the hotel are by Fresh, and the mini bar has great stuff. Given the fact it was $28 for 2 glasses of wine in the Tropicana Bar we tended to use our minibar as a fridge rather than consume its contents. We were erroneously charged for something from the minibar and queried it at checkout but it was immediately removed, no problem at all.Plasma TVs, comfortable beds, the location cannot be beaten.I can't see how it could be improved upon.

<Content>Loved it and would stay again in a heartbeat! We were very hesitant to stay here given the plethora of bad reviews, but we were more than pleased with our stay.We found a booking code on Travelzoo for 119 per night. While this got us the cheapest tower room, the check-in clerk upgraded us to a Cabana Pool Room! The desk and concierge were all very nice and helpful to us.The room was huge and clean with a very comfortable bed and great bathroom. The clerk made it clear upon check-in that as a hotel guest we were permitted to bring up to three guests to the Tropicana Bar. The policy was clearly stated by them and upheld by the Tropicana staff. We decided to go have a drink at the bar and we found all of the staff very nice and courteous. We really don't understand all of the bad reviews about the rude service.We also ate at the in-house Dakota restaurant and absolutely loved it! We each had a Kobe steak and it was one of the tastiest steaks we've ever had in our lives (and we've had Kobe steak in Kobe). The restaurant staff were also friendly.Yes, the lobby of the hotel is dark - but it's massive and Moorish architecture. It's true to its past. It is what it is and we felt it would have been a shame to turn the lights up and ruin the atmosphere and architecture.The hotel has two laptops with free internet connections in the check-in area which we thought was a great nice touch.The hotel is also only about a block from the Hollywood/Highland center and the metro stop there. For all of those who say don't take the metro we disagree! We thought it was great! We took the FlyAway bus from LAX to Union Station and the metro the rest of the way to the hotel. It only cost us $4.50! Two weeks later we stayed at the Hotel Mosaic in Beverly Hills which uniformly receives good reviews on TripAdvisor. We agree that it is a great hotel, but we liked the Hollywood Roosevelt more! All in all we loved it. Maybe the management has gotten the message, or maybe everyone who stays there hoping to see a celebrity and doesn't writes bad reviews. Whatever the reason, we disagree with the bad reviews.

<Content>Very trendy! Nice hotel but definately aimed at the people with money and young (!). I liked the decor and staff were friendly and nice, the manager incharge of the valet could maybe do with some 'people' skills but all other staff were nice.Room was small but nice and very clean. Be warned mini-bar charges for everything. Location is excellent and the pool area is very very nice. Got a bargain of a price so can't complain.

<Content>Friendly, helpful staff Old Hollywood, right there on Hollywood Blvd. My room was small and had a crappy view. But it was clean, decorated in a minimalist style with interesting BW photography and had a lovely bathroom with lots of shelf space. The staff was great. My first room didn't have AC and they moved me almost immediately so I could still make the Dodger game at 7:05. The concierge was very helpful with tours, dinner reservations, setting up my pedicure. My experience in the spa was great, too. Yes, there was a premiere party when I was there and it made access to the hotel difficult. But LA isn't the easiest city to get around anyway. If I'm in LA again, I'll try to get into this hotel again, too.

<Content>Not Impressed I agree 100% with the writer from Ottowa Canada I only wish I had read the review before booking this hotel. The swimming pool is used on Sundays for a private party, hotel guests have to wear an armband and it's impossible to get a seat or a bed, the staff are more interested in the party guests than the hotel guests.Had to wear earplugs because of the air conditioning noise, reported the excessive noise to 3 seperate members of staff, nothing happened.Would not stay again

<Content>Quite Satisfied My husband and I just got back from a two night stay in a Garden Cabana room. I was a bit hesitant about our accomodations due to prior reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the hotel is dark and the layout a bit confusing, but afterall this is a modern hotel. This sort of styling isn't for everyone. Our room was clean and had a lovely balcony. Housekeeping and room service answered our requests in no time at all. We had a lovely dinner at Dakota's and easily gained entrance into the Tropicana for after dinner drinks. The drinks are expensive, but it is fun nontheless to peak into the lives of those who want to make it. Whatever that means. Overall, we'd stay at the Roosevelt again. The staff was quite friendly and attentive. Plus the location can't be beat if you are coming into the city for some exploration.

<Content>A Disappointment Was looking forward to staying here. When I checked in the room was very dirty. The bathroom had not been cleaned at all. The carpeting looked 10 years old and had not been vacumed. The drinks at the bar average 8 to 10 dollars plus. My two day stay was over a thousand dollar bill. The computer system for the hotel was down the entire stay. Very poorly managed!! The downstairs restaurant and lounge are nice but other than that this hotel is not worth it. You can stay at much nicer Hotels for alot less.

<Content>crazy experience They authorized my card next day for the restaurant bill of $372, even though we had split the tab by 4. I don't want to talk about the service nor the half baked bouncers at their club, as the only thing thats nice about them is the food and the chef.Looks like the whole hotel staff including the restaurant manager needs to be send on training to europe at a Michellin 1 star restaurant. It's hollywood blvd, waiters and servers are wannabe actors who don't have passion to serve, but are worried about their next audition.

<Content>Not as bad as you would think Stayed at the Roosevelt for 4 nights. Although there are good and not so good things about this hotel it was worth the 150.00 a night that I paid. I was satisified with my stay.The good: Location. Right in the middle of the action.Never got refused admittance to the tropicana bar or pool. Party going on Sat. and Sun. nights and we got in even though we stayed in the tower rooms. Some B list celebs were there.Staff was very nice and never made us feel unwelcome like other reviewers have said. Beds were very comfortable. Air conditioning worked well in our room. Did not hear all the noise everyone else complained about either.Our room also did have a tub.The Bad: Rooms are very small and dark. No room for luggage and we kept banging our legs on the bed frames as we tried to move around.The bathroom is tiny with no room to put your supplies. The shower only had half a door and the water kept soaking the floor. I would stay here again and recommend it to everyone else.

<Content>Not recommended!! Stayed at the Roosevelt on business. It was really a grand dissapointment. The room was not clean and the bed noisy and uncomfortable. Parking is a real problem since the hotel valets accept anyone. Expect to wait an hour or two to park at your own hotel during the early to late evening!! The staff did not provide very good customer service. They charged me for a night I did not stay and never returned repeated calls to solve the problem. The quality of food in the restaurant was very low. There are so many better places to stay and eat in LA. Will never stay here again!!!

<Content>Worst hotel in LA! A group of us traveling for business were scheduled to stay at the Roosevelt for over a week. To put it bluntly, the hotel was completely unacceptable to the entire group. Filthy and disgusting rooms. We could not cancel our first night's stay and had to scramble to find another hotel. The overall consensus of the Roosevelt was extremely negative. Not one redeeming factor. A Holiday Inn is better then the horrid Roosevelt. Everyone was relieved to leave the Roosevelt the next morning. Do not believe the PR hype. This place is a disaster. The best place to stay in LA is L'Ermitage in Beverly Hills.

<Content>Place continues to go downhill Stayed at the Roosevelt a couple of times before the renovation and several times after. The renovation was badly needed and even though the rooms are on the small side and kind of spartan, it was a fun place to stay up until about a 18 months ago when the Tropicana (pool bar) got to be the hip place to party. The pool and bar were beutifully renovated, but the majority of the time it's off limits to guests due to various parties and events unless you pay $500-700 for a cabana room. Even then you have to go through the security gauntlet to just get to your room. Many people at the pool as of late are non guests and many lounge chairs are now reserved. The service has gotten worse and the staff seems to care more about it being a nightclub rather than a hotel. Front desk stafff is hit and miss. Elevators take forever. Parking and entrance is jammed on weekend nights. It's a wannabe W. Better bet is the Rennaisance for a Hollywood stay; good service, nice rooms  staff I recently discovered the Westood area and now stay regularly at the W there instead. The Hollywood W scheduled to open in 2008 will give the Roosevelt a serious run for it's money....

<Content>Horrible atmosphere-great location Chose this for its location at the heart of Hollywood and that was ideal for us with a short visit and a teenage son keen to do all the Walk of Fame, Kodak Theatre and El Capitan cinema all on the doorstep. But for all the hype of Oscars etc this hotel totally lacks any sense of style or glamour..The main reception area is fascinating in a gloomy gothic sort of way. A most unwelcoming hotel-gloomy airport style lobby in the basement-we had to ask the huge security guy how to find it. Reception staff very nice but its not an easy hotel to navigate-not least because its so dark everywhere. Confusing layout and anonymous characterless dark grey corridors, with scary unfriendly security men everywhere. A lot of the old character has been refurbished away in a dull grey brown minimalist kind of way. however the bed was gorgeous and the pillows and sheets lovely. The bathroom was horrid-poky and dark with a cracked washbasin and hairdryer handle broken. So over priced and disappointing.

<Content>An outstanding hotel The hotel was beautifully decorated. It had great restaurants that served great food at reasonable prices. It was in the heart of Hollywood as the stars were right outside the door. The room were lovely and very inviting. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The pool and the pool bar were also up to a high standard. There is not much more I can say but if you are going to Los Angeles this is the hotel to stay.

<Content>What a Dump ! Whoever came up with the phrase the customer is always right would be appalled by the service received at this hotel. The staff is rude and uncaring, and they seem to care more about the people who come to their pool bar then the people staying at the hotel itself. Imagine advertising that they have a pool and then not being able to take your kids to it because of the MTV Beach Party that is going on........and that was on one of the few days that they actually allowed us to access the pool. Nearly all of their staff who interact with guests need charm school classes, from the front desk staff, one of whom hung up on me when we called to complain that the elevator still hadn't come after 15 minutes of waiting, to the onsite managers who tell you to fill out their customer service survey as a way to voice your concerns. Although the common spaces are very nice, catering more to their celebrity visitors then the actual hotel guests, the rooms are small and sparse (a waste paper basket would have been nice), and the air conditioning incredibly loud.......if you are lucky enough to get a room where it actually works which wasn't the case for some of my fellow travelers. We kept hearing we're still getting the kinks out but the problems they have are with their people and the utter lack of concern that they have for their normal paying guests.

<Content>Do Not Stay Here I am currently staying in the most expensive room at this hotel: a Cabana Room which is near the famed Tropicana Pool and costs $500 a night. What did this mean? This meant that it was an ordeal to get to my room every day, as different 'events' were being held every afternoon. I'm talking NY Bungalow 8 level of bouncer action - they did everything but frisk me. They prevented my partner bringing her friend in to pick up a present from our room. They made me produce ID and my key to walk down the corridor at 2 in the afternoon! Remember - I'm only going from Reception to my room. This would be understandable if Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes were poolside with Paris Hilton and Simon Cowell, but these 'events' seemed to be made up of a crowd of wannabes desperately hoping the next person to walk in was famous on any level whatsoever. The Cabana rooms are small, pokey and dark, with laughable 'patios' and the level of service (apart from the sparkling car valets) is surly at best. Did I mention the rolling hotel power test that meant I had to shower in the dark? A blackout they announced via a note delivered at 5am? And upon my complaint suggested I might like to shave by flashlight? We all know what to expect from hip hotels (poor service, dark rooms, happening bar action), but this place makes the Hudson in NY look like the Four Seasons. And because of its proximity to Hollywood's tourist ground zero it never really manages the full conversion to style hotel. I tried it because I had read good things in various style bibles in the UK, and all the good hotels in West Hollywood were full. Don't make this mistake!Unless you're a REALLY desperate Hollywood wannabe, or you've got a fetish for being near Mann's Chinese and the select audience that brings.

<Content>I quite enjoyed it... Despite some shaky reviews here, I booked the Hollywood Roosevelt because I wanted something fun for a quick 1-night stay and didn't want to spend $400 on one of the 5-star hotels. It definitely served its purpose well. The location is excellent, though quite the mobbed tourist scene on a summer weekend (as expected). The lobby area might be dark, but it has been very attractively renovated and captures the older feel of the building with a contemporary twist. The service throughout was friendly enough, never rude or snobby, though not of Four Seasons caliber. My room was as expected --- small, rather dark, though clean and nicely renovated. The bathroom was absolutely tiny, which is often the case with hotels in older buildings, and water leaked from a gap between the glass partition at top of the tub and flooded the floor after a brief shower.I had plans all evening and wasn't around to spend time at the Tropicana bar, pool ,or restaurants, though they all looked like a lot of fun. The Roosevelt isn't the best hotel in L.A., but for the $179 I spent, I thought it represented a relatively good value compared to other options on the Westside. I'd definitely go back.

<Content>Only for the Brave! I stayed here for 3 nights in July. I had the previou reviews, so I was prepared for snooty staff and a very basic room.Upon arrival the doorman offered to take our cases and we told him it was ok, as we did not have that much and he offered again, and one of his fellow staff told him ' They do not want it' , well that started a shouting match between them, I kid not.Very strange, i have never seen anything like it!The check in staff were very friendly, with another check-in counter who was not serving me even asking how I was.Maybe cause I am young in my 20's I fit in with the clique!!The rooms are different from a normal hotel but they were perfectly fine. The beds are EXTRA comfortable!!!The bathroom does have a unusual red light but there is a normal light you can use as well.It is true the lobby is very dark but all we did was walk through it to exit so I do not see the big deal!The pool area has been re-done and looks good. The day we checked out and were waiting to go to airport, they were dozens of young hip guys and girls exiting in their swimwear and receiving their cars from Valet parking, so I presume that there are many people at the pool area not staying at the hotel. Which to me is not right, for as a guest of the hotel you should be able to use the pool when you want and not have it domiated with non-guests.This hotel is definately catered for a younger crowd, as I am 25 I did not mind it. The location is great for Hollywood.I would return to Roosevelt but as for LA, this is my 8th time there and I must say it seems to get dirtier every time. Being from Sydney which is very clean, it is a shock and something that I do not think you can get used to.

<Content>Great Location - Needs a change in management I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt. I had read some of the previous reviews before booking - and some of what others said was accurate.The walls are very thin - bring earplugs. We could hear the couple in the next room, and it appeared they were having a normal conversation (i.e. no yelling or loud voices). One of the nights we stayed was a Saturday night, other guests were extremely loud when returning to their rooms at 3:00 a.m. 鈥?it sounded like they were inside our room. I suspect this is the norm for older hotels 鈥?sound-proofing was not the science it is today. The room d茅cor is nothing special 鈥?dark paint, black  white mural over the bed - very minimalist, not what you would expect from a place with such great history. The bed was VERY comfortable, although I thought housekeeping made a mistake when I noticed there was no top sheet 鈥?just a duvet. The air-conditioner was very noisy, we opted to shut it off and sleep with the windows open instead.The pool was a HUGE disappointment. I always stay in hotels with pools as I like to go for a swim after a long day of sightseeing 鈥?I was shocked to return at 4:00 p.m. and find the pool packed with non-paying guests! It appears the pool and the Tropicana bar - which is adjacent to the pool, are the 鈥淚N鈥?spots for the 20-something crowd of Hollywood. Many of the hotel staff let their friends in, and one morning I observed one of the pool guys placing reserved placards on 50% of the lounge chairs at 8:00 a.m. in the morning. I spoke to the front desk about this and was told that only hotel guests use the pool 鈥?this was a bold face lie, as I had over heard one of the pool staff talking to a group of 8 pool users about driving home and coming back later for drinks - most of the sunbathers at the pool had car keys with their belongings 鈥?not hotel cards.If you want to be seen and be in the centre of the action 鈥?this is the hotel for you, if you want comfort and luxury - go elsewhere.

<Content>Never again What have they done to this hotel with so much history? I have stayed at this hotel twice before and have always had a nice comfortable time. When I had a short business trip recently, it was logical to stay at a place that I knew I could trust. Big mistake, the moment I walked in, I could tell something drastically had changed. To start of everything was black, the walls, the floor and the staff dressed in black. Felt like I was in a Dracula film with all the gothic furniture. This darkness seems to be a growing trend with some hotels across the States. I could not find my card key in my bag the lobby was so poorly lit and people were almost walking into each other, I kid you not. My room was frightening. The room was black, the bathroom light was red and to top of it. A huge photo of a man with bright blonde hair in a black jumper was above my bed looking down at me. My friend had to cover it for me with a towel, so I couldn鈥檛 see it. They charge to for coffee and teas in you鈥檙e room too, that鈥檚 the first time for me! The only advantages are the great locations near by; if you鈥檙e tourist it鈥檚 all at your doorstep. None of the staff were rude to me, that鈥檚 a plus, but I will never stay here again. It鈥檚 a shame because I had a big group of us going next year, but it鈥檚 safe to say I will be taking our business somewhere else. It is a shame the hotel has been taken over, it has lost all its glamour and famous history.

<Content>Dark, dark, dark The lobby and main areas of the hotel are unbelievably dark, I mean you can hardly see - I am not sure what ambience they are going for but it would be ok to have darkened sections without turing the entrance hall into such a dreary place.Rooms are very modern and minimalist and quite boring - they are pretty small and don't give you a feeling of comfort. Front desk staff were great, the location is good if you want to explore the Hollywood area. Overall not my type of hotel.

<Content>The Roosevelt Hotel is fabulous! My daughter and I stayed 3 nights in the Roosevelt Hotel. It was very clean. The beds were incredibly comfortable. We loved the 'look' and style of the hotel and everything about it. The staff was courteous and friendly. The food was incredible. It is right there on the Walk of Fame. I have nothing negative to say about this hotel.

<Content>Run!!!! Horrible experience from start to finish. The staff was rude, the pool was off limits to those of us who paid too much to stay there in the first place and the banquet food was horrible. Service was excruciatingly slow so the food was cold and plates were cleaned away before our members were even finished eating.Basically, we were in their way because we were nobody. It's a total shame that such a beautiful, historical hotel has been destroyed by greed and indifference to the customers. Can i say something good? Well, if i have to, it is in an excellent location and the view out of my window was Graumann's and the Hollywood sign. But that's where the glamour ends. Unless you are somebody you'd better stay away from this one!

<Content>Not my cup of tea As other posters have stated, the hotel is very dark. Our room was a dark brown and with hardly any decorations in the room it seemed depressing. Upon arriving, we were told our room wasn't ready and to check back in an hour. We left our luggage with the bell hop and returned an hour later only to be put off again. We waited over 2 hours for our room. While we were standing in the lobby, we overheard another gentlemen tell the desk clerk that he had just checked in, got his key card, and when he went to his room, there were other guests still in it!!! I do not know how his situation turned out.The beds do not have top sheets, but the comforter was nice. There are hardly any plugs, which means tieing up the bathroom while you do your hair. Please be aware that if you use the coffee provided in the room, it is charged to you in ADDITION to the regular room rate. The coffee is NOT included and is considered part of the bar. On one of the nights we stayed, the BET awards after-party was held at the hotel. While that was impressive, it made it impossible for us to leave without breaking through the tight security and standing out like a sore thumb. We tried to leave without walking through the middle of the black-tie event, but they had all the entrances and exits blocked. I even heard someone say, No, this is not going to happen, when she saw our family standing there trying to find a way out. Her reference was to the fact that other hotel guests like ourselves were not going to be tolerated walking around when all we wanted to do was leave our room and do some shopping.I would not stay here again.

<Content>Would Not Stay at Roosevelt Again My husband and I frequently stay in hotels for weekend getaways and I must admit this is the first time I have stayed in a room where I just did not want to be in the room. Generally I enjoy breakfast in bed, but at the Roosevelt I could not wait to get out of the hotel in the morning.To be fair I think whether or not someone likes the Roosevelt depends on what you are looking for in a hotel. So I will list the positives and the negatives.Positives- 1. The front desk was very nice and we were upgraded to the Cabana section of the hotel so we had access to the Tropicana during our stay. I'm not sure what is so great about the Tropicana, but if you are looking for $14 drinks then I guess this is a perk.2. We had dinner in the restaurant, the food and service were excellent. I ate the veal 2 ways and it was incredible. Negaitves-1. The airconditioner did not work properly and our room stayed a consistent 79 even though we set the thermostat lower. We were told engineering was working on this, but during our 3 day stay nothing ever changed.2. The room is very, very, dark. The walls are painted chocolate brown and the lighting is very bad. The unscreened window opens to the street so we did not open the windows. There was not enough light in the room for me to comfortably read a book.3. You can easily hear you neighbors talking, listening to the radio, or watching TV.4. The bathroom more closely resembled a jail cell than a luxury bathroom. The room is concrete, the shower is concrete. There is no tub or any hint of luxury.5. The concierge was not very helpful and insisted that he must make us reservations at restaurants rather than given us some options and letting us make our own decisions.In summary, I would not stay at the Roosevelt again. When getting away with my husband I look for a luxury room and amenitities. It appears this hotel is for people who want to be seen at the pool and the Tropicana bar. The pool is nice, but it does not make up for the lack of quality in the rooms. I would so say the rooms are lower in quality than the rooms in any lower priced chain hotel.

<Content>Glorified Days Inn After reading the reviews posted, I was somewhat skeptical about this hotel. After my stay, I should have listened to my gut instincts. I understand this is considered a botique hotel. Painting a few walls black and using minimal lighting does not constitute botique to me. Rather, the hotel was a glorified Days Inn. The attempts to be trendy were silly. A bottle of MMs by the bed in a prescription bottle to mimic prescription pills was tacky. The room had no chair, only a bed in it. The AC was loud and didn't work well and the room in general was dirty. The pool was quite nice - if you are 23. Overall, the hotel caters to a 20something crowd that does not need/want any comfort during their stay. I would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great but expensive This beautiful hotel as I understand it was the venue for the first Academy Awards. Very stately, with beautifully appointed rooms. After a slight hiccup on checkin (they misplaced our reservation) we were appeased with a few drink vouchers redeemable at the Tropicana Bar. Our meal in the restaurant was very expensive with very small portions, something we found very unusual for restaurants in the USA. The location was prime, metro across the road, one stop to Universal Studios. Situated right on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Chinese Theatre across the road. The staff were very courteous and our concierge Andrea was extremely helpful with tour bookings. Our stay was very comfortable and enjoyable

<Content>Hollywood Hotel stayed here for 3 nights in May 2006. Initial reception not very good. Could not use air conditioner -very noisy. Clean but small. Good location. First hotel/motel I have stayed in that I had to pay for coffee in room-discovered this at check out at extortion prices. Similarly discovered coffee not included in buffet breakfast. Minor issues but irritating to say the least. Valet parking.

<Content>Great location, not so great hotel!! I stayed here for 3 nights, the location is fantastic, everything is on your doorstep, couldn't get better. However the hotel is very impersonal, dark (bring a torch for the dining area), the reception staff are distant, not unhelpful but not helpful either!!! The hotel is quiet and really just a place to sleep rather than to relax and people watch.The room was a good size and comfortable but on our last morning we found a cockroach in the bathroom and we were glad we were leaving. The reception sent a member of staff up immediately but were not apologetic, even when we checked out 20 minutes later there was no mention of it even though it was 4.30am when they knew we had rang them about it.I would not stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Stayed here for 3 nights in November. Requested a room on a higher floor and after being offered a larger room on the 4th floor, we were eventually found a room on the 11th floor. View was away from the main sights of Hollywood Blvd but still very nice. Room was of a decent size with 2 large beds, TV, CD player, minibar (reasonable prices), tea/coffee making facilities (which you get charged for), safe, plenty of storage space. Bathroom was nice and clean. Plenty of hot water. Only minor complaint was the colours - very dark in the corridor and the lighting did not make it very bright. The room itself was brighter. Excellent location on Hollywood Blvd, close to all the main attractions. Could see pool from room and it looked very nice but never had time to investigate. Would definately stay here again if we wanted to be close to Holywood Blvd.

<Content>Good experience I had to be in Los Angeles for one night on business (up from San Diego). I grew up in LA and even went to Hollywood High so an opportunity to stay in a great old Holloywood landmark was one I could not pass up. I was not disapointed. The hotel has been upgraded nicely. A little too soon to be passed fad modernist for my tastes, but well executed. I was on the sixth floor with a great view of the Chinese Theatre and the Hills. The bathroom was great, the second best hotel bathroom I have ever experienced. It had a huge walk in shower and a seperate tub/shower combo. More than I needed but it would be nice for a couple or family. The staff is big in attractiveness and short on skills. They were helpless when it came to questions about the (poor) internet service. No WiFi in my room, which I find unacceptabe at this price point and class of property. Also, the TV was particularly bad. It was a little noisy with party-ers on my floor, but I can't fault the hotel for that. This place attracts a wild crowd and I think that is some of the appeal. I would stay here again.

<Content>short on good and long on bad.... My husband and I went with another couple to the Roosevelt recently. Our suite was pretty nice - a large room with some design-junky furniture overlooking the hills. It had a white leather banquette and a spray-lamp and a lot of interesting art. It was quite a nice room. Got room service once and it was actually very nice and prompt.But the fun kind of ended there; first of all, the other couple booked and paid for a junior suite on expedia. The Roosevelt told them there were no more junior suites and because they went through expedia, they wouldn't be able to get the suite. They were relegated to a standard room - which was about 1/5th the size of our suite. Beware - don't let the front-desk people at the Roosevelt take advantage of you like that. I think there are several reviewers on this site that had similar experiences. If you pay $150 for what expedia advertises as a junior suite, you should get a junior suite. I've contacted expedia about this. The hotel should quit this consistent and suspect practice. Moving on, the ceiling vents in all the rooms on our floor were under a well-lit catwalk under the roof. So maintenance could (and did) get to look into the room, and you could hear whatever was going on in every other room on the floor. When people partied until 4:a.m. then had a fight, my husband and I were privy to every last dramatic detail. When another family ordered room service 3 hours later, we knew what they ordered. The alternative was to turn on the A/C which sounded like a jet engine. The vents in the other couple's room were worse. Bathroom was very small, out-dated. The main ventillation was into the bedroom (not good). The toiletries were great - but only *some* rooms got lotion and body-gel while others got shampoo and generic soap. The more I think about that, the angrier I get: Just give us all the good stuff! How much could you be saving? The Roosevelt's club is evidently the hottest club in the town. But as a guest, you can't go to the club. Don't try it, don't think about it, just leave it alone. It's not going to happen unless you book a $400 cabana. I talked to a guy who had a suite and tried to get in the club. A bouncer took him aside and told him he'd let him in if he paid him $350. Elevators: mind-boggling. Took some people 45 minutes to go down 12 floors. I got acquainted with the fire-well by the 2nd day.OK so the interiors of this place look nice and our room had a lot of style to it. There just wasn't enough good stuff to make up for the snobbery and alienation. I can't remember a time I paid so much to stay at a place denied me full access to its ammenities. Bottom line, this place cuts way too many corners because it thinks it can get away with it on unwitting tourists.If you want to get treated better, stay at the Le Montrose - same price but way more services and seamless luxury. Or the Renaissance, or the Bel Age. Or the Standard, or the W. They're all a similar price and they treat you like a..... guest!

<Content>Uber trendy This is quite the uber trendy hotel...our second hotel in LA and beat the socks off the other one. Fantastic lobby for drinks...Tori Spelling was at the next table!!! Drinks are quite expensive...$10 for a bottle of water!! But the room was very cool, although very noisy at night...it sounded like everyone around us was moving furniture. Apart from that it was great, right on Hollywood Blv, across from Mann's Theatre so location was fab too.

<Content>Very Swanky Loved the Hotel Roosevelt. We arrived early  to our surprise our room was ready. The rooms looked like they had been renovated  were very nice, with a view out onto the Hollywod Bvld. Our stay in LA was made so much more enjoyable due to the fact that the staff were really nice,  went beyond there call of duty every single day. They booked resturants for us, gave directions, checked our luggage into storage  ordered Taxis  transportation.The Lobby bar is a good place to start of the evening with some refreshments. The pool area is very swanky,  the food from the tropicanna Bar was to our surprise was beautiful. Didn't see any stars our whole time we were in LA, but would Def stay at this hotel again. The Mini Bar is quite expensive, as we found out, after comming back to the hotel  kicking on till the wee hours of the morning. Great location opposite Kodak Theater  Hollywood walk of Fame. Well done to ALL the staff of the Hotel Roosevelt!

<Content>An average hotel My husband and I stayed at this hotel on the last leg of our honeymoon, when we checked in we were given a single room (we may have been on our honeymoon but a single bed really wasn't ideal!), when we complained we were told there were no more rooms... eventually they moved us to a revolting smoke filled room which smelt so awful. The following night we were moved again to a lovely room but this did spoil our trip to LA. Other than that the hotel is lovely and the pool side bar is a very cool place to hang out.

<Content>Bring your binoculars My partner and I desperately wanted to stay in this location, but couldn't quite afford the pricetag. I did my research and got a reasonable deal on Expedia. ($159 p/n) for a Single superior room with double bed. The room was TINY and very basic, however, it did overlook the valet parking and nightclub entrance to the pool area. Take your binoculars and you too might spy Paris Hilton and friends!

<Content>Great hotel - beware pool drink prices It was a great hotel for young travellers (I stayed with two friends, all around 25 years old). Good location, fun people. Our room was cute, adequately sized and overlooked the Walk of Fame. We were a bit nervous driving to our hotel, as we passed some questionable neighborhoods and a friend had warned us that the Hollywood area was ghetto. But we were pleasantly surprised to find the strip of Hollywood occuped by the Roosevelt very nice. The pool is nice, nothing extremely special but cute. But drink prices were a bit insane. We paid $75 for a small pitcher of Vodka Lemonad that was way too sweet to even drink. We each had one sip and left the rest. Overall, a great experience. I would definitely go back, but avoid the drinks at the pool.

<Content>OOPS! Being a movie buff we picked this particular hotel due to its history and P.R. write-ups. We thought the back entrance a bit odd, but persevered. Service personel were cordial and helpful. We were toured and shown the room where the Academy Awards had been presented. When we got to our room we were not surprised as we had looked at the rooms on the net. It had an upscale decor.As we settled down..to unpack I was shocked to realize that there wasn't a bureau. I called the desk and they were a bit flustered; bell boy sent up; flustered; a few phone calls..my last comment was did you expect me to hang up my lingerie in the closet?..when told I could use the closet. When it all settled we were slightly upgraded to a larger room with a bureau..and very accomodating. King bed, nice linens..but, as we settled in we began to notice the tired carpet, the chipped paint, the lack of continuity in the decor; the so-so view; the safe that had to be replaced with a new one; the bathroom that looked like it had been constructed from a used construction site...concrete floors that had streaks on them. There really was nothing that was excitable. The location was superior.We put on the happy face and began to explore.The first shock we got was that guests do not have access to Teddy's..the new club. It is advertised and sounds like you can use it..but, the truth is ..it is a private club , with a key..for movie stars to enter and do whatever they please. The pool bar is also excluded on some nights. It almost appears that it is a private playground for the stars. The service elevator was broken and the workmen used the single guest elevator so that getting up and down was dicey.The lobby, front entrance is unappealingly dark. You need a flashlight to see...It hides the gorgeous decor and ceiling. Now, thats the negatives..the dining room was splendid for breakfast. That was the only meal we had there. We would not stay there again.

<Content>Close But No Cigar If the accomodations were half as lofty as the attitudes, this would be a fine hotel. The main areas, though dark, are suitably dramatic and set a cool tone. The rooms did not meet expectations. My middle aged husband and I were upgraded to a poolside cabana by a breathlessly excited reservationista who assured us we could bring two friends to the club that night. Unfortunately, it is not my idea of luxe to be interrogated by a twenty-something trendster armed with a velvet rope and a rubber stamp to get to my room. The room was clean and the linens were high caliber, but the bed itself was soft and lumpy. The rooms are high concept, mid-century inspired moderne but constructed strictly of cinder block, concrete and cold mirrored surfaces. On balance, it seemed like a stylish means of renovating an old motel without actually upgrading the infrastructure one iota. Wear and tear is starting to take a toll too. The concrete flooring in the bathroom was noticeably cracked and broken. Endless dark hallways with no elevator and no signage ensured that we roamed lost every time we wanted to leave. It was OK at $159 but would have been an outrage at the aleged standard prices of $500-$600/night.

<Content>Neat experience! My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights this summer while on a long vacation in California. I was quite suprised by the other comments!! We had a really nice time here--it is definitely a DIFFERENT type of hotel! If you want to experience Hollywood--you will get the full effects of it here! Definitely go to the pool if you want to see celebs and other crazy Hollywood types--we were lucky to actually spot a few!! Our room was fine, we dined at the steakhouse there, now called Dakota and were very pleased with the food and service. The front desk staff were pleasant with us as well. The only thing negative about the hotel was having to valet park your car and it is a whole process to get your car back out! I recommend just having them park it when you get there and leaving it and just walk places if you can!! I think this hotel might be better suited for younger crowds and couples. Not much of a family hotel atmosphere, but overall, we were pleased.

<Content>Fantastic time!!! My fiance and I drove to Hollywood from San Diego and decided to stay the night at the Roosevelt Hotel before our flight home the next day from LA back to Heathrow.We found a great offer on Travelzoo and paid $99 for the kingsize room.When we arrived at the hotel we was greeted by the valet car parking guys who took care of our car and took our cases out of the boot and into the reception area, the car parking charge for the night was $23. We then proceeded to the reception desk and was greeted by a lovely lady who was extremely polite and friendly, she told us that we had been upgraded which we couldnt believe and we had a poolside room all for $99. We was shown to our room by another member of staff who showed us where everything was and if we needed anything who to call etc, and also informed us about the poolside party which would be held later that evening and we could invite 2 friends along who were not staying at the hotel if we wished.The room was fabulous, the decor was second to none, the bed was so comfortable and the bathroom was sparkling clean along with the rest of the room, there was a cd player, and flat screen tv, bath robes, hairdryer, phone, mini bar.The prices of the mini bar were quite pricey so we didnt have anything from there and we ate out rather than in the restaurant as we wanted to see some of Hollywood. We had breakfast the next morning in the hotel restaurant which was fantastic the service was excellent and altho a bit pricey $60 with tip for breakfast it was well worth it.The only thing i would complain about is the lighting in the room it was a bit dark altho that it was in line with the decor but the lighting could have been a bit better.The pool was fantastic, and we would definately go back again and wish we had stayed there for a few more days - i would definately reccomend

<Content>Wonderful service, beautiful hotel I was kind of freaked out by the complaints on this site, especially since I paid a lot more than I usually do for a hotel since I knew I'd be using the hotel to do a little work and would be spending more time in the hotel than I usually do on vacation. However, within moments of arriving at the Roosevelt, all my fears were wiped away. The staff was friendly and courteous, the room was lovely and clean. I had a fantastic sandwich from room service, I spent the morning lounging poolside with my free paper and later in the day journaled a bit in the quiet and gorgeous front lobby. I was there during the weekend and it was a bit loud, but I didn't expect it to be country-cottage quiet. It's in the heart of Hollywood and there's a club onsite and they had a party in the lobby. I didn't mind it at all, and slept fine, but anyone who would mind it shouldn't stay here, or should bring earplugs.I do agree with other comments that the springs did poke through the mattress and I did mention that to the hotel- and I thought the absence of a top sheet was kind of weird. However all in all- the helpful staff, the nice and relaxing rooms, the gorgeous pool, the historic architecture and the fabulous location made this one of my favorite hotel stays.

<Content>Don't stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt There really is no excuse for such mediocrity, when the Renaissance around the corner offers every luxury for 10 bucks more.The king standard rooms I had were shabby and small, and I can honestly say that something went wrong every night of my stay. The aircon was broken twice, the bathroom flooded several times - both the impractical bath/shower and then the aging plumbing of the toilet. In fact, despite the hygeine issue, staff there did not offer me another room when the toilet was flooding the floor.Other irritations were the lack of mini-bar on floors 3 and 4, the phones which apparently do not always reach a connection downstairs (since everything was going wrong, it would have been nice to be able to report it by phone rather than having to trek down in person every day), and the awful elevators which often take minutes to arrive.I hear that the bar is pretty good, but unfortunately all I saw of it was the poor service and 1930's style rooms and amenities.I hear that the suites are actually renovated to a modern standard. That's great if you have that luxury, but the standard kings are awful - nowhere near the standard of a 2-star chain. My advice - pay the extra 10 bucks and go somewhere good instead.

<Content>could be a great hotel Just came back from long weekend stay at this hotel. First my complaints:1) Front desk needs better people skills. I had confirmed reservations (with a copy of the email) and they still argued about the rate. When we checked out they tried again to overcharge us. 2) The Valet parking is a joke. They lost our car several times and took FOREVER to get it when they did find it!3) My friends room had numerous carpet stains and smelled musty.4) We had to ask for the robes and the towels are way too thin- need to be upgraded. Our room safe never locked consistently. I would guess all of the above are due to inexperienced management. It is the little things that make a stay enjoyable.HOWEVER- the concierge (BEN) was fabulous. He made us several wonderful and hard to get reservations for dinner, put up with us changing the time constantly and was able to get us in to the Tropicana Bar. He basically saved our trip for us. We ended up spending alot of time out by the pool, enjoying the private club atmosphere. I will be sending a letter to the management about the problems we encountered along with a letter to the concierge thanking him.Like I said- This could be a great hotel.

<Content>Pretentious and Unjustified I went to LA to see some friends for the weekend. I booked a cabana room at the Roosevelt as i understood it was facing the pool and would provide an excellent location to chill and enjoy the party. Prior to arrival i was told i could get 4 guests into the hotel but at check-in i was told only 3 other guests could accompany me to my room. A large group of friends who arrived were forcibly turned away from the bar and could not enter the poolside lounge. It didnt matter that my room rate was $600. An ambience of snobbery and harsh attitude by the staff is their best asset.

<Content>Worst hotel I've ever stayed in I felt unsafe in this hotel. We were required to go down a dark side street to get back into the hotel because there was a function in the lobby. The corridor to our room felt unsafe as well. We booked a room with 2 beds and got only one. Got a fold out bed and they left it standing against the wall because it wouldn't fit on the floor. Towel bar in the bathroom fell off the wall every time I dried my hands. Room incredibly small and mattress terrible. Service was rude and practically nonexistant. I wanted to leave as soon as I checked in. I've lived all over the world-Far East, Middle East and presently living in Europe. I've travelled extensively and have never seen anything like this place. It's as if they want you to GET OUT.

<Content>Not a bad place to stay I travel to Los Angeles once a month and try to stay somewhere different each time. Based on recommendation from a co-worker that lives in L.A., I chose the Roosevelt for this trip.I made my reservation VERY last minute. Then read the reviews here and was very nervous about my stay. But decided to give it a try, and move if necessary.I arrived Sunday September 18 - that's right, Emmy night. A little trouble getting to the place - Hollywood Boulevard closed, parking lot closed until I motioned to the security guard and kindly told him I was checking in. Which he did without question. This was a true test: I arrive in my capris, t-shirt and flip flops, straight off the plane. The hotel is swarming with sequined gowns and tuxedos, humping with the post-emmy party in the lobby.Despite my clearly NON-celebrity status, everyone was VERY friendly - valet, check in staff, bellman.Reviews are true regarding the private parties in the lobby and pool. But I was able to enjoy both areas during my five day stay. And when you're in Hollywood - are you really hanging out at the hotel anyway? And isn't part of the attraction to a Hollywood hotel the chance star sighting? Those are the people in those parties.Room service was probably the best I've ever had: timely and absolutely delicious!I travel extensively and am VERY particular about the hotels I stay in. I have stayed in many european style hotels - which is what this is - and find them very comfortable. But, I realize that not everyone is into that, and if you're not, then you indeed won't like the Roosevelt. I believe the hotel is still renovating guest rooms; starting from the top and only down to the 8th floor as of my stay. I think that might explain the sparse furnishings and bare walls.I can't wait to go back!

<Content>Cheap renovation, Uncomfortable beds It is terrible what they have done to this historic hotel. The rooms have been VERY cheaply renovated, which basically means they took out almost all the furniture, painted one wall cocoa brown (with sloppy edging, bad painting) and put in beds so cheap you can feel the springs. The hallways to the rooms are also dark brown, making them dismal to walk through. And what used to be a beautiful, glamorous lobby now is now semi-gothic, dark as a cave, rented out for special events. And it's true that you can't access the pool as a paying guest after 7 pm. We were even hassled just wanting to SEE the pool around 6:00 pm. Even though it was teeming with people we were not deemed cool enough to be seen there. The sad fact is, once this hotel is done being the in place for the hipsters, it will become simply a cheap hotel stripped of its glamorous furnishings and past. Don't bother.

<Content>Frustrating stay!!! We will never stay at this hotel again..........On arrival, first impressions were really good. The valet and the front desk staff were very friendly and efficient. However, from then on, our stay got worse and worse. On the 1st night there was a private event held in the hotel which went on until 2am and our room on the 4th floor vibrated until that time. We rang to enquire when the music would stop and we were told the hotel had no control over the event. We chose this hotel as an ideal location to end our 3-week stay in California and one of the attractions was the pool. However, the pool was unavailable to guests for 2 out of 4 days of our stay, due again to private events. The hotel bar was also unavailable during our stay. The general impression we got from the hotel is that unless you are attending an event and / or are a celebrity, you are not valued. This is confounded by the fact that we were told that 95% of guests are attending private events. It felt like we couldn't use the facilities that attracted us in the 1st place. To be fair, the front desk staff were understanding and as a result we were compensated with 2 free breakfasts and free parking. By the way, we recommend the chocolate chip french toast!!!If you stay at this hotel and are inconvenienced, we recommend you complain to the front desk and ask to be compensated. This is the 1st time we have ever had cause to complain at a hotel, so this illustrates the frustration we endured on what should have been a perfect end to our holiday.

<Content>Big big disappointment We arrived tired and hungry after a long delayed flight at 6.30pm to find that our room that was supposed to be ready at 3.30pm wasnt ready even though they had an extra 3 hours to prepare! We then had to spend an hour in the lobby getting tired and emotional awaiting our room which when we got in was unclean, small, with a noisy aircon and lacking sufficient towels, pillows, coffee mugs for 2 occupants (let alone a family of 4). Getting housekeeping or front desk to answer the phone was so impossible I had to go down to the lobby again, join the queue.....When we went to the pool the following morning we were told that as we were in a Tower room only 3 of us could go in. I complained loudly, were a family of 4 for pity's sake, and I kept it up for a long time and eventually we got in but the front desk staff were v. rude. At the pool, it was a bit noisy but the kids loved it until thy stopped doing lunches in a blatent attempt to get you to take their over-priced bbq burger option.Oh, and the Valet Parking left me with a dented fender on my hire car. the onyl good thing about this place was the breakfast where the service and food was excellent - just over-priced.This is not a family friendly hotel and its exceedingly overpriced. If you have kids THEN go somewhere else!

<Content>What the hell? Don't expect customer service or even manners at the Roosevelt. There's a new scene at the pool/bar. Sure, there may be some celebrities but you won't see them - hotel guests are not allowed in. I found out that the hotel pool is usually closed to guests because of private parties or the exclusive bar. They're not even nice about it. We were treated as if we were a bother and told to move on. The rooms weren't even that nice. I checked out early and will not return.

<Content>horrible, horrible, horrible my boyfriend and i stayed in this hotel for one night to enjoy a nice hotel one day while on vacation. when we checked in we were told they could not find our reservation and were left standing in the lobby for almost an hour. we were treated very cold as though it was our fault, and when finally given a room, we had to ask for directions to the room (once again treated like dirt) and no one offered to help with our bags..they were to busy helping the nicer dressed guest. our superior king room was the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in, and the bathroom was even smaller. we were kept up all night because of the paper thin walls, we could here everyone else staying on our floor. our city veiw (which was extra) was the back side of the hotel's sign. the pool which we were told is open till 10pm really closes at 7pm and becomes a private club that even the hotel guest can't use. when leaving it took the valet 35 mins. to find our car which when then had to walk to even though everyone elses was brought right to the door, and once again were not helped with the bags...the guy didn't even hand us our keys they were left for us in the car!!! we were also charged for things from the minibar that we never touched!!! this was a horrible waste of our money, we were treated much much nicer the next night down the road at a much cheaper hotel.

<Content>OK I stayed here for 6 nights, in order to attend a convention in downtown LA, as I did about a year ago. On the positive side, the hotel had a nice location close to the Chinese theater and Hollywood/Highland (the one somewhat nice area of Hollywood Blvd.). Getting to the metro station was very easy. I didn't have any real problems while there. Unlike others, I actually found the staff to be quite friendly, but I never had any problems.I felt like this hotel was trying to be trendy and chic, but it just made some things wierd. As another person mentioned, there are no sheets on the bed - just a comforter. I assume (hope!) they change the comforter cover, but it still seemed wierd. The soaps and shampoos were all some sort of herbal something or other - fine but wierd.Furniture was fine, but a bit worn. I understand they've had a recent renovation, but I sure couldn't tell.I didn't eat at the hotel, but there was a good Gelati shop right nearby, and a good Thai restaurant a short walk the other direction.On the negative side, parking was expensive ($23/day - it went up $5 in the past year!). You have to pay separately for each computer you want internet access on. Hollywood Blvd. overall is not a particularly nice place (though the immediate region of this hotel is OK). Overall, I thought it was an OK place, but it's nothing luxurious.

<Content>poor service and terrible attitide Stayed for one night only ... a saturday night. When called on Saturday am after arriving in LA to check about an early check in they said the reservation was cancelled. I had not cancelled the reservation and they could not tell me who at the hotel had cancelled the reservation or what day it was cancelled. Fixed the sitation only to receive a chilly welcome at the front desk. The service was snooty and room service was not even picking up the phone even though there was a late night room service menu in the room. After trying for 15 minutes to get someone at the front desk or room service to PU we gave up. As mentioned by others who have reviewed you can not go to the pool area past 7pm as it is closed and is a private club. Even hotel guests can not get into the bar/club. Went to the pool on Sunday but once again very pretentious and over rated. Our Jr. Suite was roomy but was not overly impressed with the ammenities. Not recommended and definately not a child friendly hotel.

<Content>Hope you don't expect sheets Upon entering the hotel, the smell was stagnit. Their were painters in the lobby and the entire hall permeated a strong paint smell. Once checked into the room, the furnishings were very old, the switchplates were hanging on to electrical cords barely preventing them from touching the ground. Pulling back the bedspread which had unidentifable stains present, there were no sheets, and no blankets on the bed. The mattress could be seen through the paper thin fitted sheet. As you begin to lie on it the electrical tape holding the mattress together snapped and popped and I began to fall into a hole in the middle of the mattress. As I had received a room with two beds, I tried the other bed. As I pulled back the bedspread, their was again no sheets, no blankets, and what appeared to be urine stains on the mattress. Needless to say, I packed back up and looked for another Hotel. I was truely disappointed as I had heard this was a fine hotel. I would not stay there again.

<Content>Terrible experience, such a waste of a good hotel! Even from the beginning of our stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt, we had terrible service. My husband and I checked in around 10 pm on a Friday night, and were told by the hotel that there were no rooms left, and that they had overbooked the rooms. Even though, we had made reservations 2 months in advance for a 3 night stay! We complained to the front desk staff and manager on duty, who didn't give us much sympathy. They were too busy attending to the other guests were were attending a party in the pool area. The management's solution to the problem was shipping us to another hotel, located 10 miles away! After coming in from a long flight, being tired, etc. we were VERY dissapointed that the Roosevelt could not accomodate us in any other way, despite having a confirmed reservation. They also could not guarantee us a room for the following night! They suggest that we call the next morning to see if there were available rooms. What is the point of a reservation, if you have no rooms available?!Apparently this happens more often than they like to admit, since many other guests checking in on the same evening faced the same problem. It seems the staff were more attentive to the party guests, rather than their own paying hotel guests! We did end up staying the 2 remaining nights at the hotel, only to find our room very small, dirty and dingy. There were huge dirt spots on the carpet! The pool area was off limits and limited to VIP access. We weren't even allowed to go into this area, which was guarded by security, even though we were guests of the hotel! The only good thing about the Roosevelt was the location of the hotel which is located right across the street from Gruman's Chinese Theater, Kodak Theatre, and the Hollywood and Highland Complex. After returning home from our trip, we contacted the management of the hotel. They did not even both to give us a call back! We will not be wasting our time and money on this hotel in the future. We'll be staying at a hotel where they value their guests!

<Content>Totally Hollywood, a strange stay..... This was a strange, but satisfying, stay from start to finish. The front desk people were very nice but explained that the pool would close at 3pm for a private event. It was about 1:30pm, I do understand that check in time was not until 3pm, so we were early. We quickly changed into swim suits, and rushed down, we really wanted to go in this historic pool! As we arrived, we were told the pool was closed. We asked really nicely if we could just briefly check it out. There were people setting up for the event who were obviously kind of mad at the sight of tourists with kids arriving and trying to swim. We did take a quick dip, but were pretty much glared out. Oh well, we did get a brief look. We were mildly dissapointed that our room did not face the famous Hollywood Blvd, but that feeling went away quickly as we watched some sort of red carpet being rolled out in the valet parking area below us. We joked that we might see stars ! We went about our day enjoying the area and all its wierdness. The hotel was a SUPER spot to be based to see all the action. The stores, the food, the famous sites, the new complex across the street, etc. This hotel is totally Hollywood. The elegance of the lobby, the ballrooms (you can peek in), the lounge, even the pool area, were fabulous. When we returned to the hotel, tired and a little overwhelmed, we discovered that there really WAS a red carpet affair going on in the pool area and there were in fact stars present. We actually got to take pictures from our room of people arriving. This was way cool, need I say more. My husband and I took turns going downstairs and standing with the real photographers. We never saw anyone except some dude I later learned was Magic Don Juan. (?) A lady in the restroom who was obviously leaving the party told me it was a party hosted by E! for Hugh Heffner and his lady friends. Wow. Overall, this night was pretty unforgetable.The next day, the lobby was closed because they were filming something! The hotel room was very modernly funished, low beds, a sitting couch, a nice desk, a big closet. I paid $189 for a room with two double beds. Yeah it was a little small, but this is an old hotel. It has been uniquely redone. A doorman told us they are striving to get away from the touristy crowd and recapture the hotel of the stars status. The lobby was unsurpassed in its elegance and overall ambiance, sort of dark and gloomy, but upscale like a castle. Cleanliness was great, bathroom was nice and even had great shampoo and conditioner! We were travelling with kids, and this hotel wasn't exactly very kid friendly, but that was OK with us. The service was OK, kind of snotty but this is Hollywood. I would stay again, hopefully without the kids!

<Content>Disappointed Spent a week at this hotel in May. Picked it for location and a really good rate for the week. I agree that it was incredibly noisy--heard every sound from next door through the very thin walls. Maybe I am naive, but I was furious that they charged me for using the coffee pot in the room each morning, not to mention that it was next to impossible to get someone to leave creamer and suger each day. Housekeeping never seemed to have any on hand, and the front desk was indifferent to my requests. I travel to LA often, and I will not stay there again. Sure, the location is great for tourists, but I think one can do better.

<Content>What a waste of a beautiful hotel This hotel is beautiful and charming and classic. The rooms itself were beautifully furnished, especially the ground floor suites with the cabanas. Other than that, my experience with the Roosevelt Hotel was poor. The staff did not seem to care that we spent money to stay at their hotel. Clearly, whoever was famous or somebody trumped all guests. Service is very important to me, especially from a hotel. All we encountered was an unhelpful, inept, unwilling, and infuriatingly, unapologetic staff. It took almost half an hour to check in because there was only one person at the front desk, in a very loud lobby. Friday evenings are a nightmare at this hotel. Check-in means averting the throngs of Hollywood scenesters and starlets who are clamoring to get in to Tropicana. Paying hotel guests, however, have no access whatsoever to the pool that they so lovingly advertised online. I left feeling disappointed and even worse, robbed.

<Content>If you like attitude and bad service the Roosevelt is for you The renovation of the hotel is all for show. The bell staff gave quite a bit of misinformation. Upon entering our room we had to double check that we were in a room and not a closet. I was shocked that for $300 a night we were staying in a box barely fitting for a single person. The online descriptions of their rooms as opposed to the one we got was COMPLETELY misleading. We required a roll away bed, and when it arrived it didn't fit in the room!!! We had to pull the mattress off the rollaway and lay it on the floor. It was the most uncomfortable sleep I've ever had in all of my hotel experiences, springs in my side is not what I would expect from a hotel held in such high regards. After our night on the town we returned planning on getting a little pool time in. Upon our arrival we asked what time the pool closed, we were told 2am. We were all ready for a swim and after making our way down we were told by a doorman that the pool was open only to those in Cabana rooms or on a guest list!!! We had paid $300 dollars for a box and couldn't even use the amenities of the hotel!!! The next day we made our way to the pool and though the food was great, the service left much to be desired. Our server didn't bring the correct amount of drinks we ordered, she brought us the wrong menu to order from, which we weren鈥檛 informed of until almost an hour later, now mind you, we had already been waiting with our tummies growling only to be told we still had to wait for our food to be prepared. We had to check out by 1pm and we inquired if we could still use the pool after our check out and we were told we could. So we left our things so as to not lose our spot, and went to check out. Upon returning to the pool we were greeting by an EXTREMELY rude guy working as a doorman for the pool. No one informed us we were only allowed 2 guests pool side for the room we had reserved. We tried to explain that we had been out there all morning, left our items to secure a spot, told we could return to the pool but he wouldn't budge. His attitude was horrendous!!! we understood that the hotel had it's policies, but he could've handled the situation in a totally different manner. He was fed up with us and told us if we had a problem to take it up with the front desk, so we did. We explained our issue to the front desk manager and he said that it would be no problem and he would speak with the rude employee. Upon returning to the pool he blew up and said we couldn't enter the pool area and he didn't care what anyone said, and stood by his reasons of doing his job. I found it odd that someone working the door had more say than a Manager. Disturbed and frustrated we gathered our things and left. The hotel staff left a bitter taste in our mouths after such a sweet weekend, not the best way to end our fun weekend. It wasn't so much the hotels policies that bothered us (although we found them ludicrous) it was the attitude, the lack of decent customer service. If this is what the new hot spots have to offer, I want no part of it. Not only was I a customer, I am a human being, I should never have to tolerate anyone belittling myself and my companions when I just want to receive services for which I had paid for.

<Content>Should Have Listened! In booking this hotel I read previous reviews but thought, everyone has their own opinion so I decided to go ahead and form my own.......Well, I should have listened! The check in was very unorganized as they were short staffed (by their own admission) and the room we were given did not look like the photos. Our bed was awful with springs poking us in the back all night long. Towles were a bit shabby as well. The next day I asked to be moved to a larger room, which they did, and this room was slightly better. Mattress was still hard and in need of replacement but towels were nicer. The bathroom has been renovated and the shower now has a half glass door, which caused water to leak all over when showering. The walls are paper thin and we had to call security one night as we could hear everything going on in the next room, including a fight. The hotel itself has been renovated but the new owners do not allow pictures to be taken.......what a shame that a Hollywood landmark with so much history does not allow its guests to take pictures to remember their stay. I found this very disappointing. The pool closes every night at 7 for private parties, once again alienating the paying guests. If the new management spent more time trying to make their guests happy and less time trying to be the next in place to be more people would write better reviews and therefore recommend this hotel. Party places come and go but good customer relations go along way. The best thing about this hotel is the location.

<Content>too much hype - VIP access only had high expectations for this hotel, travel to LA about 12-15 times a year so, with all the recent hype, I thought maybe this beautiful landmark would replace my usual West Hollywood spot, but when I had people over, I was told that hotel guests were not aloud to use the bar (apparently it is closed every night private parties 鈥?you are not even able to go outside and enjoy sitting by the pool in the evening) and was instructed to go down to the hotel down the street and use their bar. My immediate response was 鈥榳hy didn鈥檛 I just stay there then?鈥?the rest of my experience was nice enough but definitely didn鈥檛 meet up to the level of any number of other hotels in the area 鈥?(they don鈥檛 even have a website).

<Content>Awesome Hotel! Great hotel! My girlfriends and I spent the weekend in Hollywood and made reservations at this hotel. While pulling up in our car, the valet staff was very courteous and helpful. The hotel lobby staff was just as courteous. While checking in, I had requested a room with a patio. Unfortunately, they couldn't accomodate our request, but said they can give us a 'cabana' room on the ground level (no change in price). They advised that it could get a bit loud at night due to the festivities that take place in the pool area in the evening. We agreed to this room and off we went in search for our reserved room. As soon as we opened the door, we were amazed at how awesome the room was! The only bad thing was there was only 1 king size bed for 4 of us girls. However, I was in awe with the room decor. The bathroom was so awesome and chic! We had a ground level patio with a lounge chair and table. Our cute bell boy brought our luggages from the valet area and updated us on the nights events. We were very excited to hear that since we have a 'cabana' room that we are entitled in and out privelages of the pool festivities. While everyone waits in line to get in where the party's at, we just had to flash our room key and confirm our room number and reservation name. The hotel restaurant was delicious and we were honored to have the wonderful service. We didn't have reservations, but they easily accomodated us after a 15 minute wait. The hostess and wait staff were very courteous and fun. After dinner we went to the pool festivities (didn't have to wait in the huge line) where we encountered Kimberly Stewart and Hank Azaria. The pool festivities were hopping and the drinks were great! Great place for anyone who wants to have fun and possibly hook up. At the end of the festivities, we went back to our awesome room. I would've had a good night sleep had it not been for the people walking and talking throughout the hallways during the early morning hours. After a few hours of tossing and turning (5:30 AM), we finally called the front desk to get the noise level toned down in the hallways. The walls must be really thin because 5 minutes after the call, I heard security asking the folks in the hallway to keep it down. The bed was the most comfortable I've slept in a looooong time! The only crappy thing is I am now ridding my ankles and lower shins of the bruises I obtained from the platform bed. My bad, I just kept accidently banging my legs on it everytime I passed by the bed (forgetting it was platform). All in all, this is a wonderful hotel and definitely a great place for the folks who like to party! I will definitely stay there again!

<Content>So much history! Location, location, location....it was in the PERFECT location. Directly on Hollywood Boulevard. The front desk staff is a little icy, however, the hotel itself is wonderful. We were upgraded to a king suite when we had to wait to have our room cleaned before we could check in. The room was HUGE. It overlooked the Chinese Theatre. Be aware that it is a noisy hotel. The Boulevard is up all night. The hotel offers so much history, but they do need to advertise it better. Much of the history of the hotel I discovered through books, not through the hotel itself. Shirley Temple tapped on the steps, Marilyn Monroe lived over the bar overlooking the pool. Just to name a few items of interest. Nothing is marked at the hotel.It is also walking distance to several attractions. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Roosevelt: Hooker Haven My husband and I stayed at the Roosevelt over New Year's Weekend in '04. We were impressed with the decor and location, very convenient, but not impressed with check in service. Room service wasn't too bad. Room was great. However, we went to dinner New Year's Eve and when leaving found the hotel filled to brimming and more in the parking lot; a NY's Eve party was evidently being held in the hotel. The numbers of people indicated more bash than party. We returned after midnight and the hotel was overflowing with people. Many of them quite honestly looked like hookers or call girls, some were obviously transvestites, many with multiple men on their arms and overcrowding elevators to the upper floors with their partners. We could not get to our room. We tried in vain to find stair wells. After wandering through crowds of people and smoke, we finally were able to cram into an upward-bound elevator and managed to get to our room. The noise continued even on the 10th floor til well past 5:00 a.m. I was appalled to see that there was virtually no hotel security, anyone could wander in off the street and apparently did, and appalled that they allowed this sort of activity to go on so openly. What really got me though was seeing a family with young children in the same dilemma, trying to get up to their rooms. I can only imagine what the children must have thought.I wrote the hotel an email about our experience, hoping at least for an apology. We got no response at all; we never have. My family and I will never stay there again under any circumstances. If they continue to treat us and people like the Bermans in this way, when the celebrity train has passed them by, and it will, they will find themselves with no customer base.

<Content>Wear a hard hat! The hotel has a nice location. I stayed there 06/29/05. A careless cleaning lady dropped a long pole she was cleaning windows with and it hit me on the head. She did not apologize - just looked scared and picked it up. When I tried to speak to the manager about it he refused to talk to me. An icy front desk person referred me to the security person on duty. Not even an apology from anyone! Very disappointing! The hotel is clean - not fancy. Beds are comfortable. Couldn't find the ice machines where the info in the room said they would be. No pop machines. Neighborhood scary at night. Parking charge is high. Although the nicest employee was the one that parked my car. Not sure I would spend my hard earned money here again.

<Content>dont be put off by grumpy guests! wonderfull place wonderfull history Firstly ill be honset my girlfriend and i were travelling around america and mainly staying in hostels, but this gas not put bias on my opinion of thsi hotel. from the moment we booked it, (at a good rate on expedia) till we left we would (unlike many other reviewers) have no pety complaints about anything. yes we got upgraded we think because there was a movie magazine awards so as not to be disturbed by noise, so that quashes the main bad review going around of staff not doing anything about the noise. the room was lovely, and still kept a sense of history and class , which if you have read the other reviews is what the hotel has with it holding the ist oscars. the hotel has not lost this sense of sophistication at all. (take note of this when you read other reviews) as for the guy complaining about it being on the route of l.a tours surly that says somthing positive about the place. nicolas cage had a party hear a week before we stayed!!!!!!cant be that bad really!!staff very friendly and helpfull, even tho we were two young travellers and to be honest didnt have a choice but to dress like it! decor very nice, not a bad word to say about it. it is typical that people will find somthing to moan about but if you look at what they moan about it is all personell and ther is nothing here that will do anything but make your stay in l.a more enjoyable!!!!

<Content>Should have left it alone The hotel has recently been overhauled with a $15m purse - and thankfully they stayed fairly true to the original d茅cor, mainly because they had to 鈥?it鈥檚 a national landmark. However, the budget seems to have been entirely spent on the LOOK of the hotel, definitely not the FEEL. I can honestly say whilst I am not a big Hollywood night scene person, this is the worse place I have been to in LA for years. Not only did I have to pay $14 for a martini (more expensive than any of the leading NYC hotels and most of the LA hotels) but they didn鈥檛 even have any martini glasses. We had to wait over 20 mins for our drinks from the library bar (not books but hey it had plasma screens - TV is the new book right?), which had four other people in it. No, not four people deep queues - just four other people!! The bar steward would wander off mid-pour to help the cocktail waitress - of which there was one for the entire lobby floor. Upon leaving, we had to wait 20 mins for our car even though it was parked 10 feet from where we were stood, because the snotty valet supervisor was too busy helping people out of their range rovers and other bling cars. I watched in disgust as a family of four who were actually staying at the hotel, got out of the sedan and had to remove their own bags and carry them to the front desk - why? Because someone with a flashy car behind them needed their doors opened for them. This hotel has huge historic meaning - Shirley Temple practised her dance routines on the stairs in the lobby, the first Oscars where held here in 1929, Winston Churchill stayed here, Marilyn Monroe had her first modelling gig here, Errol Flynn hang out here- and whilst there is the argument that by doing up the hotel they have preserved it, finally driving away that night I couldn't help but think that they'd destroyed something instead.

<Content>Great Loction but Hotel was not so great. The location was great! It was within walking distance to some really great resteraunts and other Hollywood sites. The hotel lobby was nice, but really dark. We were in meetings all day and wanted to see the pool. They closed the pool at 7:00 p.m. every night and then had Private Parties every night. We were there for an entire week and never got to see the pool. Our convention sponsors should have just told us that there was no pool available. Our room was more like a closet. It was EXTREEMLY small. We did not even have a chair. One could barely move in the shower. I asked to be moved to a non-smoking room but was told that they could not do that because the hotel was full. I think that the thing that freaked me out the most was that there were no sheets on the bed. I was told that this was a European trendy thing. I thought it sucked. I got the clear impression that Hotel Guests were considered second class citizens and that you were only treated well there if you were someone important or trendy.I would never stay there again.

<Content>Extreme disappointment We booked a room and were confirmed a room with 2 beds, one for our 13yr old daughter and one for us. When we arrived we were told that the hotel was filled to capacity. The room we were given was one bed only. When I complained I was told that there was nothing they could do - and gave us a roll in bed! We then went to have dinner at the restaurant after dressing only to be told that hotel guests do not have any preference and they were already fully reserved. When I asked for directions to any other nice places to eat the hotel staff were unable to help me. After finding a place to eat some blocks away, we returned to the hotel to sleep and were unable to settle due to the noise from the pool area. The hotel finally turned the music off after 1am. When I complained the next morning to the manager I was told that there was nothing that they could do to address any of my concerns or complaints. They did not seem to be concerned when I told them that I would not recommend the hotel to any-one.

<Content>Mixed feelings This hotel can be seen in many movies. Well, it is located in front of Mann's Chinese Theatre, which also features in many Hollywood movies.It is located very centrally, meaning that you can do a lot by just walking there. So you can see the Hollywood stars, you can view the handprints at Mann's Chinese Theatre. And basically you can visit loads of cheap shops that sell t-shirts and map that feature where the stars live. From the hotel start loads of tours (even bringing you to Mann's chinese theatre, just 10 seconds walking from the Lobby... wow... what a tour!). So you can visit Universal Studios, do a trip of Los Angeles, see the Chimneys of the houses of the stars. As far as location: it is a good hotel. Even though most of the street seems to be glitter and glamour from past days and it seems gone. If you have any expectations of getting a Hollywood-feeling... it tends to dissapoint. All the images you already know from tv and the movies, and in real they tend to be dissapointing. The hotel itself is old (when we were there), and is in need of a make-over. We visited this hotel as part of a tour, so I do not know exactly what we paid for this stay. But the rooms were simple, and you always got the feeling that this hotel was something special years ago, but not anymore. Like visiting the hotel 50-80 years too late. Basically a dissapointing hotel, but nice to see it in many movies...

<Content>Good location and rooms but service needs improvement The desk staff were totally unhelpful in this hotel, it took the reception girl almost 15mins just to check us in. When we asked about public transport we were told to just take cabs and no one could offer any advice about how far it is to walk to certain locations etc... On our day of departure we asked for a cab to be booked we went into the lobby and found it hadn't been booked at all and we almost missed our train as a consequence.The restaurant was quite nice despite being a little expensive but the rooms were fine.

<Content>Noisy, Noisy, Noisy Dont stay here if you like a good nights sleep.stayed here for 4 nights and wished i did not. Hotel has a large bar at the outdoor pool with music till the early hours, and the carpark below has cars coming in and out gone 3.Even the airconditioning is very loud, even when switched off. Booked through orbitz, and you get given the smaller rooms in the hotel (not like they look in the website), and when i asked to be moved they said that there were no other rooms ' at that rate', and seemed to look down on me because I had booked on orbitz. To be fair the hotel is quite nice, and in a good location, but if you are sensitive to noise, dont go there!

<Content>Very noisy hotel Stayed two nights here and would not stay again, There is insufficient sound proofing for both internal and external noise. It is in the heart of Hollywood and noise is to be expected however staff do not seem to prevent or control local noise. We had a noisy motorbike revving its engine at 3.00am in the valet parking area. The hotel is also dark and gloomy. There also appeared to be insuffient security as we were confronted by a lift full of drunken teenagers who were not residents but wanted access to the penthouse. Would not stay here again!

<Content>loved the Roosevelt My stay at the Roosevelt hotel was pretty good. I thought the rooms were sound proof (mine overlooked the carpark) and the staff were very friendly and professional. This hotel is a huge old but renovated place with heaps of style from Charlie Chaplain days. It took me a while to undertand the lay out of the hotel but once that was out of the way it was great. The pool area was so kitch with an art deco feel. really cool. I had the junior suite which was plenty of space for one person. The daily morning delivery of papers was great and the bathroom was groovy. The only problem was the toilet blocked but as I later found alot of toilets block in the USA. I would definatley stay there again. I loved it. It wasnt the best best best hotel in the world but for the price ($100) per night and the fab location it was well worth it. Just make sure your shuttle drops you off around the back of the hotel not on Hollywood Blvd. The back is actually where the front entrance is. Your first impressions will benifit if you do that.

<Content>Very nice hotel Spent 3 days in this nice hotel. The rooms we stayed in were completely new, modern and the bathroom was very nice as well. There was a CD player in the room with a complimentary CD (mix of Lounge Music), which was a nice plus. I read the other reviews and expected much worse. The restaurant in the hotel serves excellent food and the breakfast ist excellent as well.If you're looking for a hotel in the Hollywood area, I would definintely recommend this one, because it's just a 5 min drive away from the nice restaurants on Sunset Plaza.

<Content>Fun, good location, nice We recently stayed here for 3 days in May 05 and it was great. The pool area is not currently under construction. The lobby is huge and dark and a great place to hang out and have drinks. The rooms are small but very clean and modern. It was good to be right in the middle of everything. Sure, the area is filled with tourists but it's a fairly central place to take a cab to anything else if you need to. The walls are very thin but that didn't bother us. (Unfortunately, we were not haunted by Montgomery Clift as is rumored to happen.) The only bad thing was the mini-bar fridge is so small, you can't keep any of your own stuff in there, and you have to pay for wireless connectivity.

<Content>LA is weird The rooms were lovely. We stayed in the Tower Rooms even though we had booked a Cabana room, although the Tower Rooms looked better so we stuck with the room we had. There is a weird vibe about LA and Hollywood and this was, for me, also present in the Hotel. There was all this meeting space that was unused and a huge ballroom with like two tables and the doors were open so you could just walk in. On week days its weird to go around where the meeting rooms are because some entertainment show tapes from there and there are all these TV people around. This hotel is what i would call Very LA on the day we arrived there was a film crew shooting a pilot for a TV show called Hollywood Cops or something, I dont think it ever made ti to air. We didnt have a car so the location is bliss in the way that you can walk to the subway stop at the hollywood/Highland mall.We found it kinda hard to get good fresh food in LA but at the Hollywood/Highland mall there is a California Pizza Kitchen and A Wolfgand Puck resturant so we ate there alot. Overall, good location, OK price and LA is weird.

<Content>cavernous and old-world This is an OK hotel, but it never felt particularly comfortable to me. It has a bit of a gloomy, cavernous atmosphere -- an old but renovated hotel that has a well-furnished but dim lobby, long hallways, and a lot of meeting and retail space that seems to be unused. The staff seemed pretty erratic and the place lacks adequate signage. Getting my luggage brought up by the bell staff was unnecessarily difficult and I ended up getting the bags for myself. There is a very nice outdoor pool surrounded by a courtyard, adjacent to the hotel. I also spent a while looking for a phantom fitness room that turned out to be closed, but none of the hotel's materials included that key fact. Overal, this is not a place with a tremendous amount of warmth, even though it has a good location in the heart of Hollywood.

<Content>Not as great as promised Stayed overnite in a Junior Suite on the 9th floor. I've stayed numerous times at the Rennaissance down the way and wanted to give this place a try. The hotel location is great. The room was spacious and the decor was chic. Lots of extras. Very clean. However, the room is not well insulated and you can hear your neighbors quite well along with the Hollywood Boulevard traffic that runs all night (people yelling and taxi cabs honking away). The airconditioning/heating/furnace appliances are extremely loud and go off and on even when the units are turned off. We had unplugged the refrigerator thinking that was the noise. In the junior suite the bathroom is enlongated with a shower stall at the very end, a tub in front of that and then the toilet next to the door. The layout was odd and getting into and out of the shower was awkward. Poor lighting in the bathroom. Not a restful stay. Rennaissance way better.

<Content>Much more than we expected We were concerned with the location of this hotel, but immediately upon arrival our concerns went by the wayside. This is a grand old hotel with a touch of class. When we pulled into the parking area located behind the hotel our car doors were opened for us by staff and we were greeted like royalty. Check in went very smoothly by friendly staff. Bellman were courteous and prompt with our luggage. The rooms were awesomely decorated although a little on the small size much like most of the hotel rooms in NYC The rooms were very, very clean. The open shower effect (only one clear frameless door on the tub) created water puddles in the bathroom after each use but we discovered it was just a matter getting used to it which resulted in the least amount of flooding. The rooms were extremley quiet and soundproof. The staff seemed very professional and friendly. Overall for the price, it was well worth the stay. The hotel is centrally located to most tourist attractions in the LA area and definitely a place we would stay at again.

<Content>Very Modern, Very Unique This was a neat place to stay, the bathroom was kind of small, but we agreed the view we had O Mann's Chinese theater right outside our window, combined with a CD-player and the platform bed with duvet made up for it. This is not for the traditional, I almost found it a little too modern with no shower curtain, only half a glass door. We had trouble finding the lobby when we walked in, maybe we came in from the wrong side. I would reccomend it to those looking for an ultra-modern experience.

<Content>Best hotel in Hollywood Stayed here 10-12 March 2005 and we had the best time. We had a room on the 4th floor and the rooms were above my expectations. We had 2 queen beds which my husband and I loved and the beds had doona's which we had so missed and we had the best sleep here. The rooms are not soundproof as upstairs a guy had his tv on all night and we could here it. The location can't be beat, right in the heart of things. There was a playboy party on the night we arrived which was a bit annoying(not for my husband) lots of people around everywhere and some areas of the hotel we were not allowed to go. The lifts are SO SLOW and I could not seem to find the stairwell to walk.I would stay here again as across the street was the subway for Universal which is only one stop away.

<Content>Eavesdropper's ideal hotel If you like listening to other people's private conversations, this hotel will suit you. I have never stayed in a hotel with such thin walls! We could hear every word from the rooms on both sides even at normal conversational level and, as a result, spent our whole time whispering so that we could not be overheard. The hotel has supposedly just had a major refurbishment, but I thought our room was quite shabby and very basic despite the fact it was described a a 'Kingsize Superior Room'. The carpet was stained, the walls were marked, and the furniture dark and square. We stayed in 13 hotels in 5 countries on this trip and the Hollywood Roosevelt would only rate about number 11 on our list.

<Content>A Classic My partner and I stayed two nights March 19th weekend and were impressed with the renavations. I'd pick a vintage property with a sense of place over a blaw modern hotel any day, although last year we stayed at the near by Renaissance and enjoyed that also. The room was large, I think they may have been two rooms at one time. The pool was up and running but with the rain keeping things cool so no one was using it. The pool area looks 50/60's retro sheik. I'd like to go back in the summer because it looks like it would have a great party vibe. The check in staff was friendly and professional. Later we asked help with directions and the woman made a call to verify the hours and details of the museum exhibit we were going to. We walked around the area checking the names of the stars. It was cool to be in middle of fame. I travel to the LA area about twice a year and would love to stay again.

<Content>One of only two hotels you should consider in Hollywood... Stayed here January 2005 my third visit to this hotel. Have always had a good experience. Let's start with it's biggest selling-point - the location. Directly opposite Mann's Chinese Theatre, you could NOT be better positioned in central Hollywood. You have the Metro station within 2 minutes' walk, various small stores/restaurants at the Highland/Vine Centre a block further on, the awesome Hollywood sign overlooking the whole neighbourhood and the Hollywood Walk of Fame running right past the front door of the hotel. Hollywood itself, if you have not been there before, can come across as rather seedy, with many tacky tourist shops and, shall we say alternative residents. However it has seriously cleaned up its act over the past few years and now feels safe to explore, even at night. And if it is evening entertainment you are after, take a cab or drive a couple of miles into West Hollywood where you will find Los Angeles' famed nightlife along Sunset Blvd (House of Blues, Viper Room et al) Or try Santa Monica Blvd, a few blocks to the south of Sunset, for a wide range of gay bars/restaurants.Back to the Roosevelt.To the rear of the hotel is one of the most peaceful pool areas I have come across - shaded, quiet, relaxed, the perfect getaway from the noise and commotion of Hollywood Blvd out front. I have read reviews about the horrendous price of the valet parking - for this area, the fee is pretty standard and my vehicle was already brought around very quickly. Again, I have seen reviews that the rooms are not up to scratch. I have to say, the refurbished tower rooms (which were all completed in 2004 I believe) are fantastic. They are not in typical US style - much more Northern European, with a trendy, IKEA-feel to them, I can really see them appealing to Brits and Europeans much more than to Americans. The beds are low-profile with sleak, minimalist headboards and feather duvets/ pillows. The bathrooms, although small, are very modern and the housekeeping was excellent throughout my stay. Make sure you ask for a high floor room as the views are fantastic - either the Hollywood hills to the rear or the City of Los Angeles to the front. If you want a central Hollywood property with a very good standard of room, you really need to be looking at this one. Other than the Renaissance (which I have reviewed elsewhere) this is your best choice.

<Content>Great Location We stayed with a group of five people in two rooms at the Roosevelt in December of 2004. The complex was obviously being renovated at the time to take the hotel back to its glory days when it was made famous for hosting the Academy Awards. Our rooms were both quite nice, however they were tight on space and the facilities were average considering the star rating of the hotel. There was a restaurant being built while we were there, but this meant that we were treated to below standard services in the majority of the hotel. I would check to see whether the renovations were finished if I were to stay there again. The good thing about the hotel was its location. Right outside Mann's Chinese Theatre and the Kodak Theatre there are heaps of tourist attractions right at your doorstep. In addition to this the bus stop is directly opposite the hotel and it is easy to get to most places in LA from that spot. I would also recommend not booking any tours before you leave Australia if you are travelling to Hollywood. Across the road from the Roosevelt there are heaps of different tour companies that offer great tours for discounted prices. There is also a good tourist information booth in the Kodak Theatre Complex and the people there can help you with loads of information and phone numbers for companies. The location makes up for a lot of the short coming in this hotel.

<Content>wonderful my wife and i stayed in the roosevelt in LA as part of our honeymoon in january 2005. we both loved it, in terms of architecture, design, ambience, friendliness of staff and location, it scored on all fronts. we were given a free upgade on arrival, and had our meal that night at the quiet restaurant on the ground floor ( it was midweek in january, hence the quietness) Staff excellent, both at desk, lobby, and bar. Good modern bedrooms , with sound system, excellent bathroom products, quiet recessed lighting, ample storage space, plus walk out the door and you're facing the chinese theatre.any other negative reviews here have no idea what they are on about! did these people stay in the same hotel? stay here, it;s great and if you love cool design and a sense of history, it's made for you!

<Content>Happy with our stay We stayed at the Roosevelt for 4 nights in late January 2005.We were a bit worried by the user reviews but they had a really good rate of $150 AU per night and we wanted to stay in Hollywood, because of the location and proximity to the Metro train. We were not disappointed. The room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable. We had a nice view over the city through big windows. The room was on the small side and the beds only double and a bit firm but we didn't find this a problem, and we are a family of 4! Found the staff at reception very helpful when questioned about local transport and activities. Housekeeping was prompt and polite when we called for more towels. Bell staff were happy to look after our luggage on the last day and arrange cabs promptly. The old foyer was lovely. We were warned several times on booking that the pool was still being renovated so that was entirely expected. The evenings were a bit cold to swim anyway. Had a look at the pool area and it should be very nice when completed. Found the Metro easy to use and the station is across the road ( but remember the machines with only accept NEW $1 bills for tickets!-as the tourist office told us after we had battled with it for 1/2 an hour). It is a very quick and cheap way to get to Universal Studios and Downtown LA. Also connects to Long Beach but trip is about 1 1/2 hours. The Hollywood area itself was interesting and we enjoyed the new shopping and restaurant complex. I would be happy to stay in this hotel again as a good value , mid range hotel.

<Content>Extremely enjoyable visit My husband and I have just returned from Los Angeles (on our way back from Hawaii) and stayed for 2 nights at The Roosevelt Hotel. Having (rather stupidly I now think) read the reviews before we went, we were a little worried I have to say. However, all our fears were unfounded and we found the Roosevelt to be a visit of pure luxury. We had a wonderful room, the decor of the entire hotel we loved and every single member of staff we came into contact with spoke perfect English and were extremely helpful. In fact we didn't recognise the hotel from the description in some of the reviews we had read! We couldn't fault it - it met our every need.They did have some events going on whilst we were there. Some we weren't even aware of and the one we were aware of in no way spoilt our visit and the staff certainly didn't make us second class guests because of it. After all, I imagine most businesses have to diversify to make a profit these days and the fact that they are a popular venue for events surely means their customer care and professionalism is good!We would make a point of staying there again.

<Content>The worst of worst!!!! Flew out from Chicago for a birthday get-away with my wife. What a dump. Don't believe the positive reviews, most of them are from convention people. If you want to sit around the depressing pool and watch someone's 60+ year old aunt trim her toe nails, then this hotel is for you.We tried to get a refund on our reservation of four nights and they agreed and then never followed thru. This is how bad it was, we rented a car, drove up to Carmel for the remainder of our trip and stayed at a LAX airport before our return. Still had to pay for the room at that crap hole as well.

<Content>A great experience Have just returned home to Australia from a very successful trip to the US. Whilst in Los Angeles we stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt where we found the service faultless and the staff only too willing to assist us in any way. As we were leaving at midnight for our return flight to Australia the hotel stored our luggage for the day and not only organised a private car to collect us for transportation to the airport but also maintained phone contact with the car to ensure its timely arrival. (The traffic was horrific due to road closures in preparation for the Academy Awards.) We would definitely stay at the Roosevelt again - a truly delightful hotel.

<Content>can't wait to return! I surprised my boyfriend with a one-night stay at the Roosevelt on Sat. Nov. 20, 2004. We had driven out with some friends earlier that year and were interested in all the paranormal things we had heard and read about. We were also breathtaken with everything it had to offer, thus making us want to return to stay. So I looked online to see what their rates were, but I called to make the reservation. I booked a junior suite for one night at the price of $189, plus an $18 valet fee, but with unlimited in-and-out privileges. The valet shouldn't really be that much because the valet staff was average. The check-in staff was very polite. We were given a beautiful, large room, with a view of Hollywood Blvd. that we didn't even ask for! We were so excited! The room had a very modern CD player, a big swiveling TV, a couch, coffee table and chair, a dresser w/ a minibar.. a big beautiful COMFY bed with plush soft linen. The bathroom was awesome. It had an old-time Hollywood feel to it, and it included an amazing shower and a separate bathtub. Now i read a lot of the reviews and everyone's complaining about how the pool wasn't available because of renovations. If you're really going to be that intent on using the pool and/or jacuzzi (like me and my b/f were), find out! All i had to do was go online and click on the pool and it said it was going to be closed. I didn't freak out because I WENT PREPARED. However, the staff did inform me that they had a deal going with the hotel across the street (i think it's called renaissance, not sure) that the roosevelt guests could use their pool. Well, before attempting to walk over in our bathing suits, we took a stroll to inspect it. It was an extremely long walk through very public places where we did not want to walk in our bathing suits, wet or dry. And when we got to that hotel, we asked the front desk if they had a jacuzzi and the woman looked at us as if we were extreme idiots and huffily replied no. She made a horrible impression on us. thank god we weren't staying there. So, yes, we were disappointed about not having the pool, BUT we were prepared. Never assume anything, because obviously it leads to disgruntled people and disappointment. But it can be easily remedied by just asking the question is the pool open? One more thing that I should mention. I also read in a lot of reviews about how the staff cares more about any functions that may be going on in the hotel rather than their own guests. I disagree with that but I had a similar issue. My boyfriend and went to take the stairs up to the main entrance that leads you to Hollywood Blvd. There were no signs or anything saying that something was going on. There did happen to be a wedding and they were in one section of the room that wasn't in the way of the exit. But someone working the party(?) ran over and immediately stopped us and said sorry you can't go through here! He got right up in our personal space and was very rude about it. We were innocent..we didn't know. So, if they're going to have any sort of event...especially where this wedding was, make a sign. Other than that, we absolutely can't wait to return to the hotel...when we have money..because yes, it is expensive, but it's a wonderful experience. I also have a review about the Excalibur hotel in las vegas for any interested parties.

<Content>overrated We've stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt several years with groups. We've noticed that the hotel, due to the changing economic climate has changed its' focus to special events and large events which pay the bills! Don't go near the place on New Year's! You'll feel like an unwelcomed guest, not sleep all night and have no hot water to shower in the morning! Still in renovation the lobby remains stark with little or few relaxing amenities. The hotel restaurant's service and food remains excellent. The restaurant staff is very pleasant and efficient!Check the airport hotels which offer a more modern setting and much better prices!!!

<Content>Not as bad as the worst reviews... I stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt for business. There are some problems, but I think many of these are attributable to the fact that the hotel is old, and in an area that is only now receiving some attention for revival. It takes a little imagination to see the Golden Era of the though the hotel has been recently refurbished. For whatever reason, they don't use the front entrance as the main entrance anymore, which is a shame because your first impression is of a cramped den-like area, rather than the rather grand lobby where you can picture the way the hotel was back in the day. Details--like not being forewarned that the pool was closed for renovation, the overpowering smell of the deodorizers in the hallway and room, a worn school folder for the stapled menu and ratty photocopies of other information, and the lack of a top sheet on my bed--leave a sour taste for a $199 room. It could be that the nicer more expensive rooms are, well, nicer. The management company really should get its act together fast because it is almost there. I found all the staff really eager and helpful except, interestingly a front desk manager-type who was obviously sick of the service industry, waiting for that big break. On the flip side, the rooms are very recently redecorated, (this is not your grandmother's hotel) have CD players, down comforters, room service was outstanding (the food and the service) and the vibe is retro/funky/cool. The include a hip jazz/house music CD in the room to give you some of the background music that you hear in the lobby as you check in. The restaurant and bar look nice, although I did the room service option. The lobby is really grand. I hate L.A., so most of my negative feelings stemmed from feeling like I needed a bath the minute I got into the hotel just from riding there from the airport. The neighborhood is not nice but it IS Hollywood...the Walk of Fame, the Chinese Theatre, the tacky souvenir shops, and newer nicer stores at Hollywood and Highland's new mall. If your expectations are sufficiently lowered from luxury to nice and you aren't too sensitive or detail-driven, the Roosevelt is alright.

<Content>Wish I had believed the bad reviews! We had a suite and adjoing room for the night of New Year's Eve, did not know that there would be a huge party which would shut down all public spaces for hotel guests-no access to bar, restaurant, lobby or pool. Our rooms were at the end of the building with the fire escape right outside. Party goers clattered up and down all night keeping everyone awake. The best part came at 6AM when we were getting ready for the Rose Bowl Parade and found that we had no hot water in any bathroom. Later we discovered there was no hot water in the hotel at all. The hotel is interesting, but only a fool would go back.

<Content>Never, ever again I had the misfortune to have stayed at this hotel for 4 nights from 25 - 29 November, 2004. I had researched this site previously and the reviews seemed to come up Ok with exception of a warning about the mini bar. I kept a small containter of milk in the bar for use in our coffee (they only have powdered stuff - YUK!) and when vacating the room I removed the container and attempted to relock the bar with the key provided, only to have a shelf collapse and a bottle of beer break. I informed reception/housekeeping. I also told the desk clerk upon checking out that I was not prepared to pay for this. Guess what! I was charged over $AUD8.00 for a small bottle. Nonetheless I am disputing this. We also very distressed by our treatment by the staff. There was a Christmas Parade involving all the major streets in the area and most were closed off. We were made to feel like gatecrashers at own hotel and most certainly not put first. The rooms are old and tacky and as for the bathroom I don't even want to go down that road. We have visited this hotel briefly previously prior to their renovation and thought it was just delightful, but unfortunately the new style is just cold and boring and not worth the tariff.

<Content>Whatever your standards lower them Stayed here Nov 6th to 11th 2004 and overall I would have to say what a let down it was. The room we stayed in had been recently refurbished and apart from the carpet that must have been fitted in the 30's it was acceptable. I suppose we were lucky in that we had hired a car and only used the hotel as somewhere to sleep. Anyway a few of the bad points - if you can speak spanish or ukranian you'll at least be able to talk to the staff otherwise take an interpreter. One day I lost a jumper in the hotel and could not find one person that understood me - now I know I'm from Yorkshire but come on. To be fair there must be one English speaking person that works there because they rang our room at 3.45am one morning and asked us not to use the faucet because they had a flood in the room below ours. The hotel seems to mainly cater for various functions that seem to happen every night and paying foreign tourists are just an unwelcome inconvenience. Obviously these are only my opinions and we still had a great time in LA, but do yourself a favour and book somewhere else.

<Content>No Oscars here If you hope for luxury and grandeur forget this one. Horrible back entrance to reception. The front lobby from the Boulevard is cold, souless and dark. The facilities are non existent. Small bar with a few chairs in a lounge more like a cave. Forget chilling out, in fact the hotel treats guests second best. Only seem interested in premieres and functions so for two nights out of three the bar was off limits to the guests. Didn't try the restaurant as it seemed overpriced. Rooms in the Tower are bland, cold and feel like a hospital. Tower is always noisy as the air con vents are outside. Staff are hopeless and quite unfriendly and don't seem to understand English. Beware the rude and careless car valets, our rental car was smashed up the last night, some arguing got us a result but they hoped they'd get away with it! Mind you if you've got a limo that's different. Abysmal, dreary and cold. We stayed three nights and it was three too many!! Go to a Best Western far, far superior in every way. In fact just skip Hollywood there's nothing there but tacky gift shops, seedy sex clubs and a feeling of unease at night.

<Content>I would like to go again I stayed at the Roosevelt last January while in Holloywood for a convention. I loved it. My room was beautiful...modern...a separate shower, tiled bath, windows looking over the street. Others at the convention stayed at the hotel connected to the mall across the street. At the time Ryan Seacrest was taping his TV show outside at the mall. Fantastic area...especially the hotel! I do think that all of the rooms are not as nice as the one I had. Maybe, they haven't finished all of the rooms.

<Content>Wonderful- I would definately return! Myself and three friends stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt for 3 nights in late September. Due to the previous reviews I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised! On arrival, we went to the lobby (which was around the back of the hotel) which was small, but tastefully decorated. It was kind of annoying having to drag the luggage down stairs to go to the desk however! I was told by the guy on Reception that they were going to give it all an overhaul, as the steps caused a lot of problems. Anyway, my friends and I had booked just a standard room (the cheapest available) and were upgraded by the super-nice front desk staff to a Suite on the top floor! As far as Suite's go, I have had bigger at other hotels but it was still lovely to be upgraded! The room had a living area with a big comfy sofa and armchair, divided bedroom with two Queen Size beds, and two bathrooms. Having two bathrooms between four girls was definately a bonus! One interesting thing I noticed though, is the bathtub in one of the bathrooms appeared to be original despite new tiling and decor. The bathtub was made out of proper tough porcelain, not plastic, and the shape and strength of it, made me think it had a lot of age to it. This said, there was cracks in the porcelain around the plug hole. No big deal. The bathtub still did the job, and I figure it would cost a fortune to get fixed- and it's still better than modern junky plastic ones! The location of the hotel is superb if you want a Hollywood experience. Right in the middle of Hollywood Blvd, across the road from Manns Chinese Theatre and a shopping mall! Seemingly, Hollywood has started cleaning up it's act in the past few years. It isn't as glamorous as it once was, but is making vast improvements. Like I said earlier, the front desk staff were superb, we had some problems with a cab company overcharging us, and the hotel employees helped us out! They were always so friendly, and always remembered us! We dined at Theodores, the restaurant, for Breakfast one morning- and admittedly the waiter was rather pathetic. He tried to overcharge us (the account was added up incorrectly) and I asked to speak to the Restaurant Manager, who apologised and gladly rectified the situation. All in all, the rooms were clean, tastefully (if minimally) decorated, and the service and location was superb. I would definately stay here again! Additionally, when we were staying at the hotel, STING was staying there as well! We never saw him, but knowing we were under the same roof was definately an added bonus!

<Content>Not impressed with this hotel at all After reading some of the reviews on this site we were a little worried about are choice of hotel and boy were we right, the hotel reception is at the back of the hotel and wasn't to bad, but a little anoyed that you could only use the front entrance at certain times. The hotel is more interested in the functions that they have, then for the guests staying there. When we got to are room it was more like a hostel room than a hotel room and the bathroom you couldn't swing a cat in it, when we asked to be moved to a bigger room the response was we wil try, I gave up in the end, we only stayed there 4 nights, but 4 nights to many, would not return and would not recommend this hotel to any one, very disappointed

<Content>A nice place to stay I stayed at the Roosevelt for two days in September 2004 and found it to be a pleasant hotel in a good location. Check-in was efficient and I was offered a choice of rooms. Being from way out of town (8,000 miles out of town), the lady was very helpful and suggested a room on the eighth floor (quieter up there) with a view across Hollywood Boulevard. The room was bright, spacious, modern and comfortable, with plenty of storage space, walk-through dressing room, safe, and nice touches like a coffee percolator. It felt clean and was serviced unobtrusively. My travel agent who booked the room in June told me in July about the renovations and closure of the pool, and they were not a problem. If I'd wanted to use a pool they offered an alternative hotel nearby. I had dinner one evening in the restaurant and, apart from the standard American propensity for rushed meals, it was a pleasant experience - interesting food, friendly and helpful service, a good wine list, and the historic ambience. The only negative experience was on the final day. I'd had my bags collected and stored in the morning, spent a great day at Universal City, then returned to the hotel to pick up my bags and get a taxi to LAX. I think the desk man must have had a deal going with a company on another planet because once he'd phoned for the taxi he made no effort to get my bags, told me there was no hurry, and got on with his work. Meanwhile I watched plenty of empty taxis cruise past the hotel while I waited 40 minutes for mine to arrive. When we got to LAX the driver seemed lost and had no idea where to find the correct terminal. an unfortunate end to an otherwise pleasant stay at the hotel.

<Content>oh how it has changed! we have stayed at the Roosevelt many times over the years and last year will probably be the last time unless there is a change in ownership.We have seen this once beautiful old hotel,loose all it's character as it was gutted in the name of modernisation.Gone are the comfortable furniture to be replaced by hard,plain and ugly chinese style stuff.We lost count how many times we banged our shins on the awful bed,whose mattress was too small for the frame,and oh so low.The wonderful art deco was replaced by bamboo sticks,but worst of all the lobby was cleared of seating for the guests and hired out to private functions,while guests were driven into what once was the basement and is now the reception area,small and like sitting in a pit,we sat and watched the complaints from other guests fall on deaf ears.It was impossible to sit in the evening and have a drink at the small bar as there were only a few chairs or high bar stools.Front doors were locked every time a private party took over the old lobby so we had to walk around to the back door and dodge cars as we crossed the carpark.The mezzanine,which had once had a display of pictures showing the history of hollywood,was reduced to a drafty open gutted space,said to be a bar one day..All the friendly staff who had been there for years left,to be replaced by others who seemed more and more stretched to service the private functions rather than the guests actually staying in the hotel.This is a hotel that has completely lost it's way..is it a hotel or a collection of function rooms? What really has angered us is the fact the hotel's website is SO misleading,not a word about the still ongoing building work...it's been at least 3 years now since it started and still isnt completed.We doubt it ever will be.It is sad as we really loved the old Roosevelt.

<Content>Mutton dressed as lamb!! We stayed at this hotel for 6 night whilst on our honeymoon and our first impressions were very good, however after a long check in with rude staff we arrived on 4 floor which looked like prison cells, the room was ok apart from the maids trying to get in at 8 in the morning!! Location was good however stayed there 5 days too long.

<Content>SUMMER IN HOLLYWOOD I was at this hotel on August 1-7. I too was informed at the last minute (when I registered) that the pool  cabana area was under renovation. I booked this package (Summer in Hollywood) a month before getting there. No one mentioned to me that the pool was under renovation. What idiot in hotel management decides to do a pool renovation in August, and then sell a package called, summer in Hollywood. Then I was told that travel websites were sent this information. Funny how the hotel's own website doesn't mention the renovation. And they issued a letter (placed in everyone's room) to all guest apologizing for the inconvience. And no compensation was offered. The least they could have done is offered the guest free breakfast.

<Content>Dishonest Management The management should be censured for neglecting to tell hotel guests that their swimming pool is under construction and will not be available until late fall. At no time during the reservations process did they divulge this critical bit of information, and it does not appear anywhere on their hotel web site. Shame on you!

<Content>Photo with Charlie is a must Location was fantastic, opposite the Chinese theatre and Kodak Cinema.The hotel had been updated, but our room which was by the poolside was a bit grubby to say the least. It was supposed to be non smoking but we could smell smoke, perhaps it was the maid!Staff on the whole were friendly and helpful however, do not book trips with them, you'll get a better deal across the road at the Chinese theatre. LA, well worth a visit and this hotel was in the heart of Hollywood, when its refurbishment is complete it may well be worth a revisit or perhaps ask for a room thats not by the pool.The history of the hotel was brilliant, you can imagine those stars of the past walking through it and I think everyone probably has a photo with Charlie Chaplin in the foyer.

<Content>Loved it!!! My boyfriend and I stayed here July 2003. I am a bit concerned about all the bad reviews on this website as we thought the hotel was fantastic!! This hotel was our first stop on a tour of california and nevada and we were waking very early in the mornings from Jet lag. We had a cabana room and were right next to the jacuzzi. It was great to get up at 6am and open the patio door straight into the jacuzzi when noone was around. The breakfast was fantastic and we had the time of our lives.

<Content>historic hotel,great location, but: We stayed June 17,2004 through June 22 and this hotel was in a great location in hollywood,and it was very historic and interesting place,however the pool area was closed along with the cabana bar area that we were looking foward to that was advertised on all web sites and they put us in a small room at first with a small bed,however they did let us change rooms. some one from the hotel came into our room at 2:30a.m. and scared the crap out of us while we were asleep. also they had NO DRINK MACHINES!!!!!!  Everyone there was very nice and courtious,especially the valet people even though it cost $18 a day. I would probably stay there again when the pool is finished.

<Content>great location but no pool I took this trip to cheer up my mother you just lost her husband. She has always been intrigued by Hollywood. The location of this hotel was great for star watching, as is close to Mann's Chinese theater, the Kodak theatre were they have the Oscars and the El Capitan were Disney holds it's premiers. Our room was clean comfortable with a spacious bathroom and a view of the Hollywood sign as well as Mann's. The front desk staff was courteous and helpful. When our room key was accidentally deactivated, security responded promptly. The room service staff was great. My only complaint is that the pool and Tropicana bar that they mentioned frequently on their website is closed from June through Aug of 2004 and nobody mentioned that on the website or at the time of booking. If you want to swim or sunbathe pick another hotel this summer. Other then the closed pool disappointment , I would stay at this hotel again. The metro station is located within one block of the hotel and is cheap and easy to use . At hollywood and highland roads is a nice shopping and dining complex that is well lit and safe to be in at night.

<Content>awful place Arrived at this hotel at midnight after a flight from Alaska. Hoped that what I had read up about this hotel it would be so interesting to see where all the famous people and the Oscars were first presented and history.What a disappointment, the staff were non-chalant and uncaring. The first room they showed us was so small we asked for an upgrade which we got. We only stayed a night as we were to carry on with our journey, which was good. The staff were not very helpful at all when we asked for brochures about what to see and places of interest. They gave us a tatty photocopied map and a list of things. Other places we stayed had at least a free book of all the attractions. We heard after we had booked here that it was in a dirty area and tried to change but were unfortunately locked in to the itinerary. We placed our luggage in the bell boy's locker when we vacated the room and went to explore. When we got back to the hotel to catch the shuttle back to the airport we could not find the bell boy and it took several minutes to find someone to get our luggage. The shuttle was late to pick us up also and it was a rush to the airport. At the airport it was terrible, with the checking of the luggage as everything had to go through xray machines, unlocked. We booked out luggage in and then had to take it back to this xray machine. We stood at least for half an hour even more to get through this. We had not much time to get onto the plane for our next destination.I think that the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel is a bit of a dump, even though it is being refurbished. All the things that I had read up on that should have been there had been removed somewhere else. What a disappointment.

<Content>Great location, great history We enjoyed our stay here in late May very much. The rooms have been remodeled and are very nice, with a sort of funky Asian look. The bathrooms are especially neat. The rest of the building has a wonderful retro feel--they have done a nice job restoring the original decor. The location can't be beat if you are a Hollywood tourist and the history of the place makes your stay so much more interesting than staying in a chain hotel. My only complaint would be the $18 a day charge for parking, although the valet service was very quick and courteous.

<Content>Great Location This hotel was comfortable and neat without all the frills. I was a little nervous about booking because it was the only hotel left with rooms on a busy LA weekend. But, I was pleased to find helpful staff, a clean and stylish room, and a great view of Hollywood. The location is perfect if you are looking to walk to dinner or a movie, or just check out the walk of stars.

<Content>Nonmanaged It is a shame that this potentially great structure has a management that does not do the work needed to run a hotel. We stayed there on a Saturday night in May 2004- anticipating that there might be a lot of noise on Hollywood Blvd we stayed in the cabana (pool) area at the back of the hotel. The pool and surrounding area supposedly closed at 10p.m. A loud group around the pool continued until 4a.m. and kept everyone in that area awake. Our call to the desk which should have been unnecessary - especially with the security personnel constantly patrolling - was received politely but the noise continued. We do not recommend this hotel and would not stay here again.

<Content>Hollywood in the Old Tradition Sure, you could stay at the more exalted Beverly Hills Hotel, but if you want the quintessential Hollywood experience, this is the place! I have stayed both in the pool caba帽a villa and in the main tower. I much prefer and would recommend the caba帽a; as the room is much more spacious and comfortable, not to mention quiet, except for pool noise which might be a problem in summer. The hotel is a historic wonder and is strategically placed in the heart of Hollywood Blvd. with Graumann's Chinese theater and other attractions, Walk of Fame within easy walking distance. The lobby area has the old Hollywood flavor coupled with 1920's style architecture and Spanish influences throughout; the hotel dates from 1927, the year of the first talking picture. The mezzanine level is a tribute to Hollywood history and is worth a look in itself. The famed Cinegrill in the Blossom Room was the site of the first Academy awards back in the late 1920's or early '30s. This hotel was literally a clubhouse for the likes of Errol Flynn who purportedly invented his recipe for gin in the backroom of the ex-barbershop. Nearly every star has trysted here, including Marilyn Monroe and the hotel has attracted famous politicians and literary figures like Ernest Hemingway. All in all, a fascinating place to stay and good service as well. Remember, get a room in the caba帽a area; it's the best.

<Content>Loved this hotel, Excellent!! All I can say about this hotel is fantastic! The location is great, right on the walk of fame. The room was spacious and very clean. There was even a premier party there one night! we did have a problem with an overflow in the toilet, but it was cleared up quickly and we had a complimentary breakfast for our trouble. (which was delicious) I recommend this hotel to anyone, it was beautiful, with an excellent view and lovely pool. The staff were helpful and polite and I enjoyed my stay so much, I didn't want to leave.

<Content>Fantastic I would like to tell people that if it is their first time in hollywood this hotel is excellent. Yes I do agree that this area can be quite dangerous at night but during the day what better place to stay. There are so many attractions, you can go acrosss to the chinese theatre, walk the walk of fame, get a tour from outside the chinese theatre(strongly reccommend ask for the tour guide Brian i think.) go shopping, and all the other attractions that this area has. At night get a taxi to the places where you would like to eat. As for the hotel we thought it was excellent. We were lucky enough to stay in Marlyin Monroe's old cabana room, which hasn't changed from she stayed there. Yes a lot of the furniture was from the 1950's but if it was good enough for her it was good enough for me???? The staff were excellent they were very helpful when we needed directions and places to go to a night. Try this hotel for yourself..

<Content>Valentines Day Party I was very nervous about staying at the hotel over Valentine's Day weekend 2004 after reading the reviews on this site, and although the quality of the room exceeded my expectations the service was just as described. Upon arriving, the check-in process was extremely slow. The staff seemed to have no idea what they were doing. Our room on the 3rd floor was modern and clean. The bathroom was cool  had nice toiletries. However, the private party referred to by an earlier reviewer made our stay very interesting. The sound check started at 3 pm on Sat afternoon for the party  the noise continued until 5 am. Since we were on the 3rd floor, the bass and music were awful. You couldn't even listen to the tv over the noise. We called the front desk several times (3 am, 4am, 5am), and they said the party was out of their control (then don't have people trying to sleep on the floor immediately above a party planned until 5 am that has a dj  super bass bumping all night!) Finally the next day the manager comped our room for Saturday. Also, although the hotel was supposedly sold out (it was All Star weekend), the bar at the pool was closed. I kind of felt like the hotel was in dire need of new hotel management. In the end, not absolutely awful, but I'm sure there are better places to stay.

<Content>An ideal location for your holiday in L.A. I was lucky enough to stay here on my honeymoon and I have to say that I cannot find fault with this hotel. Right on the Walk of fame- Hollywood Boulevard and opposite Manns Theatre and the Kodak Theatre, its the perfect location for exploring this fantastic city. The staff were excellent - very helpful with advice on tours/sightseeing etc., the outdoor pool and jacuzzi were superb as was the pool bar. We dined in the hotel restaurant and it was perfect. Its also a good place for celebrity spotting.As we were on our honeymoon the staff kindly upgraded us to a kabanna room, which was lovely. I would definately stay here again.The nightlife on Hollywood Boulevard isnt all that fantastic (except fot the Knitting Factory) but dont miss a night or two on Sunset Boulevard which is a must. Enjoy.....

<Content>Shame about the staff Echo what the other reviewers say - building and rooms are great - staff and service is shocking. It was my second time staying at the hotel (first time was better) and despite a really good deal on the room, the attitude of the staff took the shine off. My tip would be - pay more and stay at le Meridien at Beverly Hills. Note also for first timers to LA: while the hotel is in Hollywood - you'll find not much else is! West Hollywood/Beverly Hills is where all the shops/restaurants are - a 15 min cab ride away.

<Content>great location, great room My girlfriend and I stayed at the Roosevelt for 4 nights in September 2003. We had a junior suite which was big and really nice. The location is absolutely unbeatable, on the corner of Hollywood and Highland. It was expensive though. I don't remember the nightly rate, but after a tax for each individual night and a $30-something a night valet fee, our total bill was almost $900. Crazy, but I guess it was worth it considering the location and room size. Another crazy thing was that our radio would sometimes come on by itself, even though the radio or arlam were not set. The station was always different too then what we had it set to. The Roosevelt is supossed to be haunted, and it might just be.

<Content>what a waste of what could be a great hotel Stayed there Feb 14, 2004 (born and raised in LA and have tradition of staying in a different local hotel every Valentine's Day). Stayed on 6th floor in a junior suite--had to turn off the air conditioning becuase fan was so loud (not broken, just old and loud) you could not talk over it. The only good thing about the Roosevelt is the physical building itself--real 1920's era art deco blended in clsaaic Spanish California touches. The bar is awesome--but we and all other guests could not enjoy it since the hotel rents it out to private parties;we wandered too close by mistake as we were trying to find a door to the street and 5 security guards were upon us. To use mini-bar, you have to walk down to front desk to get a key (and give your credit card). Front desk gave us a key, but it did not work. Did not bother going down again for fear of having security think I was again trying to crash the private rap music party. Tried calling room service from our room for dinner--but after 50 or 60 rings and multiple calls they did not answer. Called front desk which acted like it happens all the time and they transfereed me to room service (without any apology or even mention of fact room service does not answer phone). When room service came, all the girl wanted to talk about was the private party--the one no one else could get into. Called room service again next moring for breakfast (actually had front desk connect me because they would again not answer call from our room) Tried ordering coffee, but I was told to just make it myself on the mini-maker in our room. Tried, but it was broken. I would not say staff (mostly all in their early 20's) is terrible, but the service is. My feeling is that it's management's fault--they simply give staff no guidance on how guests should be treated at fine hotels, with the result that the Roosevelt is a fine physical building but sucks as a hotel.

<Content>Hollywood Roosevelt-an elegant historical treat We stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt last weekend and loved it! Our junior suite on the 12th floor was not only spacious and clean but had two bathrooms. Everyone was exceptionally nice. Room service, breakfast in the Blossom room, the bellperson--just wonderful. The historical feel of the hotel was elegant. We would highly recommend this hotel when you go to Hollywood!

<Content>Fantastic Fantasitc place to stay, rooms slightly old-fashioned, but they have recently had a renovation. Great view of Downtown and Santa Monica, great location right on the Walk of Fame. Meals were delicious, although breakfast was a bit ropey - avoid the pancakes, unless you want to take Dioralyte!! Getting around is hard, the underground looked dodgy and most of the taxi drivers are direct desendants of Dracula and don't keep their eyes on the road. Friendly staff, always willing to help out. Watch out for Elvis doing the rounds of the bar at night!!!!!

<Content>This is a very nice hotel My husband and I stayed there last weekend and I do not understand the bad reviews. I had stayed in this hotel back in the 60's and loved it, so I wanted to revisit my youth. I was not disappointed. Although it has changed, it still has the ambiance it once had. We stayed on the 11th floor with a large modern room and great bath and a great view of Hollywood Blvd. They have high speed internet and everything is completely updated. I highly recommend it.

<Content>Worse Than a Horror Movie- A Dump! Upon hearing of the old days of grandeur of this hotel, I was reluctant to stay here with some old friends but I thought that perhaps they had invested heavily in the refurbishing of the hotel and made it a top notch place to stay, was I ever wrong. Upon arriving around 1 am after a lengthly flight, half starving and dazed, I checked into the basement, where the staff was very rude, they did not even ask me how I was nor if I needed anything, they simply gave me a key and brushed me off. I walked up what seemed a hallway from an insane asylum, as I had been giving a room by the pool by the 'kind staff'. At first glance, I thought, this doesn't look good, considering that there were pools of water from the central ventilating shaft, leaking all over the place, streams of garbage, towels and dirty piles of what seemed like rotted food. I opened the door to the dirty and dingy room, thinking I was in some welfare hotel, upon entering I was disgusted at how bad it truly was. A dirty odor, smelling of foul stench, probably from the old rug which had blood stains upon it, entered my nostrils. This was really horrible and I was the first one to get there, considering my tired friends were still on the plane expecting a comfortable and safe room. I made a quick inspection of the room, from the broken sliding glass door which had no lock upon it to the terrible molded curtain that nearly fell upon my head. The beds had stains upon them, and they weren't even changed as if they had given me an previously used room. I opened the closet up and was startled to notice a 1950's style air conditioner leaking all sorts of water and fluid upon the wood and carpet, that was where the smell was coming from. The bathroom was even worse, to my surprise and horror, there was black mush in the old toilet, the rusted pipes were craclking and the mirror was very scary for it was blemished and aged. There were no towels, no soap, not even any toilet paper! The whole room had not been remodeled since the 1950's, for it was in the Cabana style, not even changed, I could not believe I was paying $150 a night for a room that looked like a prison chamber and a dump! When I tried to call the staff, they ignored my requests to get a better room. Attempting to use the bathroom, I found out that there was no water at all and the toilet would not flush! This was a complete disaster for me and when I attempted to get to sleep, I was awakened by some noisy generator that sounded as if it was about to explode. That night we looked for a place to eat and the area is dangerous, drug users, prostitutes all hang out there so I wouldn't advise walking around there and there aren't even many places to eat except dirty taco joints and a very expensive Mel's dinner. I would not ever stay here again, considering I was gimped out of a forture by the place. Be warned, do not stay here at all.

<Content>fantastic hotel We visited the Hollywood roosevelt in November 2003 for five nights.On arrival we were upgraded to a fantastic suite on the 11th floor.It was very spacious with two kingsize beds,and a huge bathroom which contained a wet room and a bath.The toiletries were plentiful and of excelent quality. we had a view of Hollywood blvd,and could see right into the forecourt of manns chinese theatre.We were also very pleased to find that we had a perfect view of the hollywood sign.The hotel was in a brilliant location,taxi to warner bros studios was $10,the tube to universal studios is a minute walk away and whilst on the tube is only a five minute ride.Mels diner is a great place to start the day, breakfast is well recomended and not too expensive.Next door to mels diner is the Max factor museum which contains loads of hollywood costumes and make up worn by the stars for example-marilyn,joan crawford. we were travelling with our 10 year old son who found the outdoor heated pool fantastic,and went for a few moonlit dips.I would reccomend this hotel to anyone.the sheer history of the hotel is overwhelming so dont let other reviews put you off.i would love to go back someday.

<Content>Used to be nice - what has happened????? Myself and my partner stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt in October 2002. We had planned on coming back there this year to spend 5 nights of our honeymoon, however, after reading the latest reviews, I think we will be re-considering. When we stayed there, we anticipated to be staying in the cabana rooms, which when we arrived (due to constructions works) we were upgraded to a room on the 11th floor. I had heard some stories before we had arrived about how horrible the cabana rooms were, so I wasn't actually looking forward to going there. When we arrived at our room on the 11th Floor, it was amazing, it was everything we could have possibly wanted. It was large with a king-sized bed. We had an excellent view of Hollywood Blvd too. The room had modern furnishings and was very clean. Everything you can imagine is in close proximity and Universal is a 10 min drive (at most). Everything you need is in this area, which is why this hotel is so appealing. The hotel is now 2 years older, could it really have changed that much? I think I'll just have to keep looking for somewhere new.... Shame.

<Content>Not as nice as it once was We last stayed here two years ago and since that time it has been in the throws of refurbishment. We had four nights there over the New Year and into Jan 2nd 2004.It felt deserted the night we arrived albeit at a very late hour. However, even during the day it was very quiet. The most number of people we saw in a given night was on New Year's eve when the beautiful people arrived in their droves for a New Years bash in the ballroom.The reception area in this hotel is now in the basement and not the lobby where it used to be. The lobby now looks completely except for a couple of sofas and a table in the middle of the room. The restaurant on this level is still there though again not many people were using it. The coffee shop place at the front of the hotel is closed.It took them many minutes to sort out a room for us as their computers were slow (overnight processing). Once we got keys we were shown to a room on the 4th floor even though we asked for a high floor. We had to ask them again to bring up our bags as they had forgotton to do so. Our room keys stopped working on the 2nd day and when the keys were reprogrammed they still did not work necessitating a further trip back to the front desk. They had it transpired misprogrammed the keys to open another room. They were apologetic about this.Beds were uncomfortable in the first room we had and it did feel very cold to begin with. It was also very minimalist in tone with also minimal counter space in the bathroom to place toiletries. We had a room change during our stay on New Years Eve as you could clearly hear all the noise during the soundcheck to the party (our room was above the Ballroom). The room change was swiftly dealt by reception with and our bags were efficiently moved to a junior suite on the 8th floor. Staff did try overall to make our stay pleasant and the porters were helpful when we checked out. There is a nice restaurant a block away called Hamburger Hamlet which is well worth calling into. We did not use room service. Its main saving grace is its proximity to Hollywood and attractions like Universal studios (the metro at Hollywood and Highland costs little and is easy to use) but if and when we return to LA we will stay in a different area.

<Content>Fantastic!! Just gives an undescribable feeling. Perfect location for all that goes on in the heart of Hollywood. Walked around the hotel and you could just feel the fabulous history. Everywhere you turned was something else to take a picture of. We had my wife, my 18 year old son, my 6 year old twins and everyone enjoyed their stay. I would stay there every time and would recommend it to anyone who likes history or the feeling of being apart of something special.

<Content>Forget it! My wife and I stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel on 13/14 September at the start of our two week 'trip of a lifetime', impressed by their website and Cabana room advertising. Our first impression on check-in did not bode well - lots of furtive looks, comments and glances between receptionists. All became clear when we saw our reserved cabana room, which was not at all close to the pool and overlooked a noisy side room. A dirty and cracked handbasin, rusted bathroom fittings and a filthy carpet completed the room's attractions. Our immediate request for a room change was ignored. Staff quite unfriendly except for the porter.Main entrance to the hotel is locked during private functions leaving guests to wander aimlessly to find a way out. It is hard to see where the much lauded refurbishment has taken place - but certainly not in the cabana rooms. This encounter nearly spoiled our holiday - thank God for the numerous Best Westerns we stayed at thereafter, the rooms of even the worst one of which was infinitely better than our Roosevelt room. Its only saving grace is its proximity to Hollywood Bvld.

<Content>OK, but The hotel is located ideally for tourism. If they offer you a room around by the pool, DO NOT TAKE IT!! These rooms are not refurbished, noisy surroundings (generartors etc). The staff are very false, behind their smile is a very miserable person. The rooms in the main building are to standard, not the biggest but goog enough.

<Content>"Poolside Cabana" is no big whoop My family and I stayed at the Roosevelt in July 2003 for our big family vacation at Universal Studios. Wanting something cool and art deco, we chose the Roosevelt based on its pictures on Expedia.....here's the thing - a) only if you stay in the TOWER Room (not the poolside cabanas - which are more $$??) do you even have a chance at the cool art deco room featured in the photo; and b) our poolside room looked (and SMELLED) like something from Motel 6 (or the Bates Motel). Old carpet, old bedspreads, a cranky a/c that leaked all over my clothes in the very small closet, a safe that didn't work 90% of the time, etc., etc... However, the staff was great, the tower room was beautiful, just what I imagined - very art deco/contemporary/zen. Would not stay there again.

<Content>You people are so wrong if you think the Roosevelt's sucks! My goodness. It really surprises me that people feel that a 3 star hotel should be double its rating and also remain the price they paid. The Roosevelt is a wonderful place. Clean, yes clean, and extremely helpful staff. Anytime that I had to speak to the reception, they were very courteous. This was our first experience of valet parking - also very friendly people. The gift shop, although opening/closing at any time, was stocked with what we needed so as not to dip into the minbar so often and the man in charge there was always happy to chat. Extremely comfortable beds (we had a tower room) and a more-than adequate bathroom (I have been in 5 stars where the bathroom is smaller). As for the neighborhood - yes it is a bit sleazy but IT IS HOLLYWOOD!!!! You get the same street hassle in any major city. The movies are right across the street (including the must-see Chinese theatre), the tacky museums are also fun to look at (see Hollywood Entertainment Museum, great people there and good value) and the souvenir shops stock a better quality of junk than anywhere else (unlike Venice Beach where every souvenir place is identical) with no hassle to buy stuff, the 101 is very close by and a block behind the Roosevelt is Sunset Boulevard (definitely worth a look). Furthermore, if you want to leave the car behind, then the Metro (across the street) will get you to many places  back for a few dollars (Downtown LA, Chinatown, Universal City, etc). If you are visiting the Hollywood Bowl, the shuttle buses are right across the street at the Highland shopping centre, so you have no tranport worries (we saw REM during our stay). Only irritation we had was the Hi-Speed Internet access required bringing a laptop (not via the TV), although the wonderful internet Cafe a block away called Cyber Java made up for that shortcoming. Also met 2 celebs while staying, and experienced the media circus surrounding the deaths of Johnny Cash and John Ritter - their stars on the walk of fame were close by. Basically, my sympathies to those who had a bad experience, but to those who expected the high society and high class that comes with the 5 star chains, then you should have booked your holiday 70 years ago and you do not have my sympathy at all. Well done all you guys at the Hollywood Roosevelt from a very satisifed customer!!!!!

<Content>Roosevelt Hotel is the WORST EVER!!! Yuck! My goodness this place was horrible! The neighboorhood at night is disgusting and during the day the hotel's terrible service took the cake. After we checked in they gave us this gross room. I was shocked how nice their rooms looked online but the truth is that their furniture and their decor was CHEAP and also dirty. I had to demand to change rooms, which took an hour and half even though the so-called manager told us they had plenty of rooms. Why? I guess they don't value their guests' time or something.I ordered a grilled sandwich and got full on stomach sickness and had to actually take that Immodium AD the rest of the weekend. Thank you Roosevelt !! YUCK!What a horrible place, stay away!

<Content>PLEASE read this and DO NOT book Roosevelt! let me tell you guys what I went through upon my check in. They kept me and my wife waitign fro 2.5 hours with Zero explanation. The room was not ready and instead of kindly apologizing and perhaps offering us lunch or something, they kept saying it will be ready in the next 10-15 minutes. Well imagine sitting there with a prepaid room for 2.5 hours while they jerked us around. NO APOLOGIES, nothing complimentary, nothing, just giving us so much attitude, as if we were waiting to get into Studio 54. Then the rooms, my God the rooms by the pool are like Motel 6 (actually worse), and the next night we asked to stay in the tower. We paid for a Deluxe large room and got this Small room instead. The decorations inside were nice but they refused to refund the difference for no reason. At night i wanted to order from room service but there was no menu in the roo. It took 45 minutes to get through to room service and finally we gave up. The hotel does not even have a full-time concierge. When we asked the front desk about this comedy club they said it was in an area with lots of taxi's and restaurants. When we got there not only was that area dead, the comdey club people laughed at us when we told them what the hotel had told us. There were no restaurants within 8 blocks!Whatever you do PLEASE DO NOT stay at this hell hole. It was such a ridiculously aweful place I actually took time to write this.
