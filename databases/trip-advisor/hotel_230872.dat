<Content>I bit expensive but worth it The hotel is located right in the Ostbahnhof so very good location for getting around the city and out of the city. It is a bit expensive but if you take into consideration that you get a good breakfast included, and free transportation on all the S bahns, U bahns and busses, it is worth it. You just go downstairs and the train station and the S Bahn is just down there. Also a mall with all kinds of restaurants and shops.

<Content>Avoid in summer! I had stayed at the InterCity a few times, and wrote a favorable review on TA in 2006. The hotel still has all the same plus points: handy location, spotless rooms, friendly staff, good breakfast and free travel passes. However as our previous stays had been during the winter months, we hadn't noticed the lack of air conditioning. It was 31C during our stay (which is not unusual for Berlin) and this left our room uncomfortably warm. The fact that many of the rooms face into a courtyard doesn't help ventilation. At any other time of the year this hotel would be fine!

<Content>Good base for tourists We (a couple in early 30s) visited Berlin for a weekend break and flew in with Ryanair on the Thursday night and out early Sunday morning from the aiport Schoenfeld.So the InterCity Hotel fitted perfectly our criteria of accomodation that was within easy and afforable reach of the airport as it's located in the Ostbahnhof station about 25 mins from the airport by train.The reception staff were very friendly as were the bar staff. We had worried that it may have been better to stay in Alexanderplatz but the hotel gives you a travel pass for your entire stay, which can be used on trams, trains and buses.The trains are so efficient, so there's no inconvenience from staying at this hotel and everywhere is within easy reach.We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as we found a cheaper option was to get the train to Alexanderplatz and visit the Alex Cafe round the back of the TV Tower. There's a buffet breakfast for about six euros.We also ate out for dinner so can't comment on the food in the hotel. There's no problem with noise from the trains at all. However, our room was facing the front of the hotel above some bus stops. At one point, all we could hear were coach engines running and people talking as they hung around but was only a problem for the Saturday night.Overall, I'd say we found it the InterCity Hotel an ideal base for visiting Berlin's attractions.

<Content>Very convenient hotel We booked the Intercity hotel because we were spending the time looking for places to live in Berlin and therefore wanted to be near a hub of S-Bahn, U-Bahn, which the Ostbahnhof is. The room was pretty small, not helped by the fact that we had a baby cot in there as well. I called before arrival to check that a kettle would be in the room in order to be able to heat up the baby's bottle. They said there would be but we would have to upgrade to a business class room. At this point we should have just decided to take our own kettle with us, but anyway, we didn't think about that. Upon arrival we were told that the double bed we had reserved was now actually 2 twin beds pushed together. On the plus side, though, included in the room price (any room price, not just business rooms) were travel tickets for zones A,B,C for both of us for the duration of our stay. This was a saving of about 鈧?0 over the 4 days, so that was good. There are quite a few shops and food places in the station, but there is a shortage of restaurants to go to in the immediate vicinity of the station. We tried the restaurant in the hotel one evening - the food was quite good, but the restaurant was pretty deserted - plenty of other options around Berlin, I suppose....I probably would stay there again, but only when travelling on business. The station is buzzy, and it is handy having supermarkets in the station basement.

<Content>A Good Hotel This hotel is located inside the Ostbahnhof in Berlin. The location is very convenient. You are also provided with a transportation card for the duration of your stay, which is also very nice (it's worth about 6 Euros per person).The rooms are decent. Nothing spectacular, but also nothing to complain about.I paid $100 Euros per night for a 2 bed room, which included breakfast. The breakfast was actually quite nice.

<Content>Nice Hotel Booked the hotel and flights through Expedia and everything went smoothly. The hotel is clean tidy modern but lacks any soul. Its ideal for a short stay break but if your looking for a hotel set in a charming location with an active night life look elsewhere. It backs onto the train station and the S bahn runs every 3-5 minutes so isnt a major problem. We had rooms at the front of the hotel. They were well designed and the double glazing really does block out any noise from the concourse. There was no airconditioning which didnt effect us as it rained! However the rooms were warm and at busy time was a choice between noisy travellers or being hot. The beds were comfortable and shower room (no baths in the rooms). There is a mini bar but no tea/coffee making facilities which I could really have done with at times.There is a small number of shops attached to the train station so you can grab a snack. There are no bars or resturants nearby to pop out to in the evening and if you go out you will have to jump on a train for a few stops. The hotel does sport a resturant in which the food is reasonably priced and I have to say delicious! There was only 4 other people in it on a Saturday night which was a shame as the food really was good.Id like to pick the hotel up and put it more in the Mitte section where there are a few more bars for socialising. Its a great hotel, reasonable prices, good travel base but only to be recommended if you prefer cocoa to alcohol! Taking everything into account this hotel is to be recommended

<Content>Super Convenient Location We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights last weekend while exploring the city of Berlin. Because the hotel is located above the Ostbanhof train station, it was super convenient to get anywhere. Plus, the hotel provided a transportation card good for use of any public transportation during our stay. We asked for a non-smoking quiet room when booking from the hotel website and ended up at the end of the 2nd floor in a large handicapped room facing the internal courtyard. It was quiet except at 9:00 each morning when the cleaning staff headed out to start their rounds banging carts and chatting in the hallways. The front desk staff was friendly, helpful and fluent in English.

<Content>Great, conveniently situated hotel I have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel and would highly recommend it for short breaks, mainly due to its location - literally connected to Ostbahnhof station - which means its easy to get around the sprawling city. My room was clean and much like a generic chain hotel, modern furniture and decor, great bathroom with power shower, mini bar etc. Despite being on the back of the hotel overlooking the station platforms I was not disturbed by noise from the trains (although I didnt have the windows open). My room was very quiet.The staff here were very helpful and the travel card you get for staying is a bonus. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the longest remaining stretch of the wall along the river and through the station the other way there are plenty of food stalls and shops. The station itself contains plenty of cheap places to eat and drink so I didnt bother with the hotel breakfast.Great value and good service.

<Content>Great Choice! We stayed in 11/05 - very late in posting. I'm researching another trip now and wish I could find similar accommodations west of Germany!The Berlin InterCity is attached to the Berlin Ostbahnhof (in East Berlin). We made the mistake of walking around the outside of the station complex to find the hotel, but once we knew where it was - it was an EXCELLENT find. Our holiday special rate included a dinner for two as well as breakfast daily (we stayed 2 nights). The InterCity's provide a local transit pass free with your stay - can't begin to say how helpful that is. In a new country/city/etc.. we had no worries about purchasing transit. Took bus or rail EVERYWHERE - especially easy considering we were sleeping next to the station. Speaking of that, we could also hop next door to grab snacks, drinks, etc.. On our last day, we grabbed a lunch to go for our 4-hour train ride to Prague.The breakfast had a lot of selection, so it was decent. Dinner was OK - considering it was free. Our only choice was the special of the day - duck. It wasn't bad (don't have experience with duck) - it at least got us to try something new. The staff always seemed a little uninterested, but the whole concept of service is different in Europe that the US.The room was fair size for Europe, from review advice we requested a room on the quiet side of the hotel (non-station side) - we heard no train noise. (I'm not sure if we would have - the rooms seemed to be well soundproofed).We were traveling with a toddler, and the crib was sturdy and, although the crib wasn't there when we arrived it was delivered promptly. The beds were 2 twins pushed together, but we ended up with that all over Europe. The comforters were great though - down. The rooms were clean - especially the bathrooms. We don't often ask much of the front desk/staff, but they were very friendly and helpful when we did interact. All in all - we really loved the hotel. We stayed at 2 other InterCitys during our trip: Munich and Vienna. We won't stay anywhere else in Germany from now on and have recommended InterCity repeatedly.

<Content>Such an amazing bargain! I booked via Hotwire, and they didnt deceive me, I paid 38 euros per night which included a twin room plus daily travelcard for 2 people (worth 6 euros each) which means that the room was only 26 euros, and for that price, it was amazing value, very clean hotel and room, although the beds were very small.The situation is right inside the Ostbanhof, with links to everywhere in the city so easily, it has also a lot of nice shops, that were open at 6am on sunday such as Mcdo, library, kebbab, dunkin donuts...Would definitively recommend it if you get a good price, the mini bar was also well price (2.50 euros for a beer) although phone calls were very expensive (around 3 euros for 2 minutes).

<Content>free travel card!! Stayed mid week at this hotel. Really clean and modern, very comfortable. The best thing was the free travel card, no messing about with ticket machines, just jump on the train and if you change your mind or get lost just jump off and go somewhere else! It was valid all the way out to Oranienburg for the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, about an hour away. Could only hear the station announcements if the window was open, we were on the station side too. Great location for getting around Berlin. East side gallery opposite hotel. For breakfast we just used the food hall at the station, really good value. Great hotel.

<Author>MsInformation
<Content>Earplugs are your only problem I went strictly on price with a lastminute deal. I'd read other reviews from fellow trip advisors and was confused by mention of the travel card. What a thrill to be given free public transport for the duration of my stay upon check-in. This is a feature for every single guest at a ICE hotel regardless of how you book. Every amenity is available because it's on top of the Ostbahnhof station/shopping mall. You don't get breakfast in the price and the restaurant is typically overpriced so the food court in the mall is perfect - there are 24hr IMBISS stands on the other side of the station too. This is on the route for suburban trains from Schoenefeld to the centre (2euros single trip) and 5 -10 minutes any time of day or night to the centre and all points of Berlin. Bus connections are easy too from the front of the station. This is a no frills very comfortable hotel. Contemporary furnishing means you can see that it's kept very clean and staff were all fluent in English for when too many trips to the bierkellars meant my rubbish German went down even further in standard.One note: You will need earplugs, on the station side of the hotel if you sleep with the windows open you will hear the train announcements (but not the trains - weirdly) and service vehicles to the shopping mall if you remember this vital piece of equipment you will have a very comfortable high value bargain basement stay. Enjoy!

<Content>Great Situation, Good Staff, Super Price Actually on the East Railway Station in the centre of Berlin (no train noise however!), this hotel is superb value for money. We booked thanks to two earlier reviews on this site and can confirm that the positives are all deserved. If you are travelling independently it is three stops from the airport. and 2 minutes walk from the train. Staff are friendly and helpful, rooms are fine and the free travel card saves a fortune. I would recommend on all accounts without hesitation.

<Content>Amazing value -highly recommended Last minute booking via a travel agent came up with the Inter City Hotel. Amazing value - not much more tham a superior hostel price for two. We saved so much money by using the free transport card in Berlin, Potsdam and to the airport.Very clean, comfortable and polite service.Fantastic position for getting a short hop train (FREE!) to all the major sights, and only a stone's throw from the East Side Gallery moving murals on the old Berlin Wall.Go!

<Content>An excellent hotel and location in East Berlin My heading says it all. We booked this hotel at the summer rate 68 Euros per night (exc breakfast) and what a bargain.The hotel is situated adjacent to the Ostbahnhof S Bahn railway station, therefore, has great public transport links including from the airport. Included in the room rate is a ticket for the public transport network which is an added bonus.The whole hotel was exceptionaly clean and the staff extremely polite and helpful.The restaurant was good value for money and the mini bar in the room very reasonably priced. On our arrival and departure day our luggage was stored securely free of charge.My next visit to Berlin will definitely be spent here.
