<Content>Won't recommend this hotel... I just came back from a 3-night amsterdam trip, and will say that the only negative thing about this short vacation was the Groenhof Hotel. First of all, it is not right in the city center, which becomes boring after 1 day. I've seen many small hotels in the city center that would have made much more comfortable to go back.Second thing, I taught that to be classified as a 3 star hotel you would need an elevator... Rooms are clean, but don't look under your bed. Furniture is old, very very basic and a poor look. The are constructions going on at the hotel, which is not the best thing to find.One of the worst things was breakfast... if you could call it so !!! Poor choice, poor quality and not that clean either.Staff was not nice, not bad either. It took them 2 days to get a second keycard done and on the second day they delivered the wrong towels in the room.I know one should not expect a lot from a 140 euro triple room in amsterdam, but we probably would have found a much nicer place in the city center for the same cost.Wouldn't go back for any reason !!!

<Content>Won't be returning to stay here! The best thing about this hotel is the location, a short walk to Vondelpark (great little cafe called 'Small Talk' just around the corner from Van Gogh museum)  Leidseplein, in a safe area and close to the trams. Contrary to previous reviews we found the staff quite helpful (on arrival our bags were carried up the steep stairs!). I can't recommend the hotel for the following reasons... the first room we stayed in was not clean, walls need to be painted (also true of second room we stayed in), the shower did not work properly, no hand towels during the entire stay, bed linen was clean but old and worn, no lift, breakfast very poor standard and overcrowded seating arrangements, overpriced and not good value for money. Despite best efforts of the hardworking staff I don't believe this hotel deserves 3 star status. We have stayed in many 3 star hotels and guesthouses throughout Europe (including Amsterdam) that are of a much higher standard than this.

<Content>Water running down the walls! stayed here for 3 nights, room was quite clean but on the ceiling were alot of damp patches and when the people in the room above had a shower/used toilet, we could here the water dripping ontop of our ceiling. woke on the last morning to find ALOT of water running down the walls ontop of us! Only plus was it was the last morning! When we told the receptionist he sent someone up to take a look and his response was, ok ill fix the problem later! breakfast was bad, you couldnt even have toast n bread was stale. stairs were v.steep and staff were not to helpful in giving directions. would not stay here again, definately not a three star, the worst hotel ive stayed in.On a good note it is walking distance to all the main attractions.

<Content>Stay Elsewhere This hotel is run by chislers. The hotel has a 72-hour cancellation policy. We had to change our arrival date, but the hotel's phone number on the reservation system used by travel agents, which we had on our itinerary, was wrong. We spent a day calling the wrong number. Finally, after tracking down the correct number, we reached the hotel, but then it was only 48 hours before we arrived. They charged us for the night and refused to remove the charge notwithstanding a letter from our travel agent. The rooms are small and without any charm. Even though the hotel offers a free breakfast, we went out everyday after the first because it was not good. The staff was friendly, but not well informed. When we asked for a recommendation for an Indonesian restaurant (which are plentiful in Amsterdam), the desk clerk said she did not know of any and instead tried to steer us to an Indian restaurant (owned by a relative of the hotel owner). We found an Indonesian restaurant a few blocks from the hotel. We asked the desk to call us a cab when we checked out. On the way to the airport, we learned from the cab driver that his uncle owned the hotel. In Amsterdam, taxis have three different rates. Not surprisingly, we were charged the highest rate.

<Content>Don't Stay Here Please listen to the previous reviews stating that this is a bad hotel. I stayed for a few nights early last summer and really regretted it. The hotel is not even safe, as they keep the door exiting to the lobby locked after midnight, which is a dangerous fire hazard involving a round about route to get out. I paid a lot of money to stay here, and found the level of comfort worse than several one star budget hotels in Amsterdam and this place bills itself as three stars. Do some research - there are much better choices for the money in Amsterdam and enjoy your holiday.

<Content>3 nights at the Groenhof I am surprised at the reviews this hotel has received. My friends and I have just returned from the Groenhof and I found it to be a very pleasant hotel. My husband and I have been to Amsterdam a number of times before and normally stay in 2 star hotels, as we prefer not to fork out a fortune for somewhere you won't spend much time. The differences between the previous hotels and this one were clear. There were six of us in the group spread over 3 triple rooms. Our room was a good size, with lots of storage space and a really comfy bed (although, as they were 2 singles pushed together, there were some 'falling through the gap' incidents!). Breakfast was great, offering breads, jams, cereals, ham, cheese, eggs, fruit juice and coffee. I've found in 2 stars that they frequently only offer the bread and jam options, so was happy with this. The stairs are steep and, if you're on the 3rd floor, you will receive a workout! The hotel might be slightly far out for some, but it's a nice walk to Leidseplein (approx 10 mins) so we were happy. Very close to Vondelpark, which was a plus. The only negative was that the cleaners obviously objected to cleaning hair from the shower drain but that was really trivial...I think the Americans who've rated it badly need to remember that Europeans rate their facilities differently to America. Compared to 3 star hotels we've been to in New York or Las Vegas, this place isn't in the same league...put in perspective though, it's a nice hotel and not too expensive in comparison to others.

<Content>Very Disappointed! Our stay at the Groenhof was brief, thankfully, only one night. We found the staff to be sometimes rude, as well as shabby conditions. Watch the pipes in the shower, as they get VERY hot- I burned my hand. We were really hungry when we arrived, there is no restaurant but that was no big deal. The lady at the desk called Domino's for us, but it was unbelieveable when we were told that we had to take it down in the basement breakfast room to eat it, since no food was allowed in the rooms! What??? I am disabled with 2 small children. Carrying pizzas down the narrow and steep stairs was ridiculous. I went step by step down on my bum, which made it a little easier. Climbing back up with weak legs was just as easy as climbing Everest. We were shorted one pillow, so we called the front desk. Sorry, you should have called us earlier, the linen people are gone for the day we were told. This was 8pm! We folded up a blanket for a pillow, and about 2 hrs later, the lady came with a pillow from another room. I will say that the pillows were VERY comfy and so were the beds, and the only friendly staff member I met was the cat from next door who liked to come in the lobby occasionally and receive scratches from the guests. Oh, be sure to be quiet in the lobby, I was SHUSHED by the desk lady for speaking too loudly to my children. Very, very disappointing time at the Groenhof.

<Content>What I Expected I stayed at this hotel, and got exactly what I expected. The cost of a single room was relatively cheap in comparison to the other hotels I found. Upon arriving the staff were eager and friendly to help me. They gave me amap, and gave good advice for places to go and eat and drink, and fun things to see. The location was excellent, a five minute walk to the Van Gogh museum. If your looking for a 4 or 5 star hotel then don't go there, but if you want a good clean hotel, which isn't too expensive with nice staff then I highly recommend this hotel for you.

<Content>Overpriced Hostel - Give this hotel a miss! I agree with the gist of the previous reviews of this hotel and would recommend staying somewhere else. On the upside - the hotel was clean, in a good location near the museums, and basic breakfast was adequate enough served in a pleasant well-lit basement room. However, at around $140 an night Canadian, the single room was more like a monk's cell than a room! It was literally a place to sleep at nice with a bathroom, that's all. There were four overhead hangers and that was the extent of the storage space. By placing the phone on the floor, I gained a bit of extra space on the very tiny side table for my socks and underwear! The bathroom was also reminiscent of tales of the Nile River flooding in ancient Egypt, and regularly flooded every morning from the shower. There was not even a second towel to wipe up the mess! I can't personally say whether the front desk people were friendly or not, an American lady was complaining about her room the morning I arrived - without any results, so I decided to perservere at this place for 3 nights and enjoy my visit to Amsterdam.

<Content>Very Basic This isn't the best hotel in the world, but that is reflected in the price. Its relatively clean the beds are comfortable. The bathroom was an adaquate size. I personally would stay here again, if it wasn't so far from the centre.

<Content>Give it a miss! When we arrived at the hotel, we had friends waiting for us and so dropped off our bags and went out. The initial review of the room was that it was a bit shabby, but we were only staying 3 nights and it was already late, so we would make do. When we returned to the room, we were able to take a better account of the situation. Why hang white curtains when you obviously have no intention of ever washing them? They were filthy. Again, only 3 nights, be patient. Bathroom facilities? What a joke! The shower stall was a tile lower than the rest of the bathroom and the shower curtain was black with mold! Also, there was no heat in the bathroom. The icing on the cake however was when I opened the wardrobe to hang my coat and the most offensive smell emerged. The extra blanket was just thrown in the top half and I have a suspicion that is where the smell came from. I was not brave enough to have a closer inspection, however. I barely slept awaiting for the morning to leave. We skipped breakfast at the hotel figuring if the rooms were filthy, what was breakfast going to be like? When we tried to check out, the gentleman at reception insisted that we pay for 2 nights even though we only stayed 1 and we explained our reasons for leaving. He insisted that this was the standard for a 3 star hotel in Amsterdam. I told him that this was not the standard for a 3 star hotel for anywhere! After a lengthy discussion I paid cash for 1 night and he insisted that he would take the other night from my credit card. We walked out and found a much better hotel just further up the block. I have never been so disgusted and disappointed with a hotel before. After having been in the travel business for the past 12 years, I can definitely say that this hotel is well below par and I would not be able to recommend it to anyone! Take my advice, stay away!

<Content>Awful hotel I spent one night only, fortunately, in this hotel.Upon arrival we had to pay cash before entering the room, theN we found on one bed , dirty linen that had to be changed. The room lacked maintenance on the furniture and in the bathrrom nothing was repared. In the morning breakfast was very poor and when i asked forchocolate for my child they did not have any. And to finish we asked to leave the luggage for the day and it was kept outside in a courtyard getting wet because of the rain. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Hotel Groenhof Amsterdam - Depressing, Shabby  My wife and I stayed at this hotel for three nights in January 2004. We booked through an agency and supposedly received a discount rate of 225 euros (plus 5% city tax) for a double room plus breakfast for three nights. First of all, my wife and I have traveled to Europe several times, and in my opinion, hotels in Amsterdam are overpriced for the quality and service given. The standard of quality in hotels in Amsterdam is generally one of the lowest in Europe in my opinion. Yes the price we paid is relatively inexpensive for Amsterdam, but there were unforgivable problems.First of all the only parking available is on the narrow, crowded streets, if you can find a spot. We had to park over a block away (which is not great when you have a lot of luggage to carry). This though is a problem throughout Amsterdam, which is why people prefer to ride bicycles.Our room was located on the third floor in a building with no elevator, so it was difficult to carry heavy luggage up all those floors (and no assistance was offered).The room itself was a good size, although the front door looked like a closet. What bothered me the most was the poor condition and maintenance of the property. Our toilet seat was completely cracked, which, I can tell you by experience, is not very comfortable to sit on. The bedside lamp was broken and falling off the wall. There was only a partial roll of toilet paper in the bathroom, which I expected to be replaced or an additional roll supplied when the room was made up each day. No; Instead I had to ask for a roll of toilet paper at the front desk. Yes it was given to me, but doesn't the person making up the rooms each day check whether toilet supplies are running low or depleted? By the way NO toiletries are supplied. I expect even a budget hotel to supply some cheap toiletries, e.g. shampoo, bars of soap, etc., but not at this hotel. There is a liquid soap dispenser on the wall in the toilet. There is also one in the shower, but it was empty and remained so all during our stay. Also, don't expect more than two towels in the bathroom.The heating was also a problem, in the sense that the room was either too hot when we turned on the radiator, or cold when it was off.The breakfast was served in the basement. You have to walk down a very steep flight of stairs, so be forewarned, as it can be dangerous. The breakfast buffet was below average. The cold meats, cheese and bread seemed stale. (You know, when that hard crust starts to form on cheeses and bread tastes dried out?)The staff were friendly enough, but, you won't find one Dutch person working at this hotel, which I assume is another economical, cost-cutting measure. In my opinion, whoever owns this hotel is too cheap. Stingy on the hotel's maintenance, with the food, with the wages paid to staff, and so on. They also have no idea how to run a hotel. This hotel may be acceptable to young backpackers with low standards, but not to anyone else.Yes, it is difficult to find an economical hotel with acceptable standards in Amsterdam, however, I think that with some research, you should be able to do better than this. There are tons of other hotels in all price ranges in this area. The hotel is in a reasonably good location, the Leidseplein. This hotel bills itself as a three star hotel! Hilarious! Not even in a third world country is this a three star hotel. What criteria are they using to award stars in the Netherlands? I would be hard pressed to grant it one star. I found my stay here depressing and I looked forward to checking out and returning home. Not exactly what you want to experience on a trip overseas.

<Content>What a Hotel My friends and I stayed in a Quad Room. There was plenty of room, it was nice and clean. When we asked for extra pillows and hangers they were delivered immediately. The staff were great, helpful and no query was too big or small. Harry, is a mine of information, always cheerful and willing to help. It is local to 'Liedesplein' (about 4minute walk), museums, markets, ideally situated. One tiny suggestion is tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms. Reception is closed at 11:00pm, so if you return to the hotel later, you are not able to get a hot drink. That being said... ...We shall definitely be going back.
