<Content>Didn't hate it, didn't love it. This hotel is on a unique beach setting, with part of it fully exposed to the surf and part sheltered by the enormous rock. That makes it great for families with small kids, or anyone looking for variety. We had a spartan but clean cottage with two small bedrooms and a full kitchen. Sitting steps from a lovely beach, the simple nature of the cottage didn't bother me a bit.  The restaurant is very good, though after a few days you'll run through most of the best items. The pool is nothing special for a resort, more like someone's backyard pool. Two things I found on the negative side. One, we didn't find a hell of a lot to do on this part of the island within easy striking range. There's a nice nature reserve with horeback riding a few miles away. And in Aguadilla there is a fun city beach called Crashboat beach where teens and families like to hang out and venders sell food and drink creating a kind of fun buzz. But other than these there wasn't a whole lot. Rincon, about an hour and a half a way seemed to have more happening. The second thing is a cutural thing. This resort is reasonably priced to the point where about half the clients are locals, who sometimes favor after-dinner animated discussions about politics, sports, the future of the world and anything else, lasting until 11 or later. so. if your are hoping to hear nothing but the sound of the surf you may be disappointed.

<Content>Would not recomend... Stayed there for 3 nights..waste of cash... Nice setup next to the beach, but rooms are in decaying conditions... One night was greeted by 6 or 7 roaches on and around our bed..had to move rooms at 1am... new rooms was better kept but i left with what i beleive are over a hundred or more bed bug bites all over my legs...also make sure you know whats included with your rooms because once there you will be charged 30 to 40 dollars per stay for a fridge, coffee maker, stove..etc... and that charge is per item.

<Content>It leaves a lot to be desired I just returned from three days at the Mar Hau. We stayed in a little villa without a kitchen. The room was small and the furniture was uncomfortable. The view and location are great. For once I thought I had done my research and that I knew what to expect. I expected the room to be a little rustic but expected the grounds and the resort to be world class. I was right about the room, but the resort was far from world class. This was our fourth trip to Puerto Rico and the first time staying in Isabela. I would not recommend Isabela or Mar Hau. The customer service was terrible. The bar keepers and waiters/ waitresses were awful. The concierge was rude every time we called; we needed directions and they kept putting us on 15 minute hold times. Once we got there they were not any better. The only nice person we found was the security gaurd and the lady who does the horse trips (we didn't even do a horse ride, she was just the only one willing to help at all). As for the resort, it was a blessing and a curse. The beach is great, the water is gorgeous. The facilities were outdated and most things were closed. It seemed as the resort would have been nice twenty years ago. Most of the facilities were closed. The shop was closed, the restaurant and bar were almost always closed. The pool bar / grill was closed. The shack to rent beach chairs/ towels/ umbrellas was closed. We were able to get some beach chairs after a long ordeal with the front desk, maids and groundskeepers. The restaurant, which was supposed to be great, was not so. We had expected to eat most of our meals there, but after getting bad drinks at the bar and a waitress who was downright rude, we never went back. As for the town, unless we missed it, there really isn't one, not in the gringo sense anyway. I was told by a local not to stay there after dark. We spent most of our time at playa jobos and the restaurants/bars there. We did enjoy our stay here and it is very relaxing. I am also the kind of traveler who does not require much, but for $150 a night, I expect a little more. This would be a great resort at $50 a night, but I can stay somewhere much better and get better service for these rates. To quote a couple we met at the pool,  It leaves a lot to be desired. I would suggest going to Rincon instead.

<Content>Great place to Relax We stayed several nights in May. We stayed in an upper unit with a fantastic view and always a nice cross breeze with the balcony doors open. The caves in the water made for great fun and adventure for both adults and children. The beach was accessible in both directions for a nice long walk! We ate at the restaurant every night and enjoyed both the ambience and the food.Our compliments to the chef--seafood dishes rated right along those of top restaurants we visited in San Juan for quality and presentation.We drove around PR for 2 weeks and stayed at different locations. This was one of our favorite. Great value for the price.

<Content>Great location, beach and restaurant. Villas and ownership needs a lot of work. I had my wedding at the Parador Villas del Mar Hau the weekend of May 10th, 2008. The location was beautiful with a gorgeous beach and small villas lining the seashore. Pool was adequate for a small resort. Some of the villas have been upgraded and some are rustic. You are not staying at a hotel so be prepared. A trip to Walmart before your stay will help....paper plates/cups, plastic eating utensils, and food and drink to stock the fridge and you should be fine. Have patience with the staff at the reception office, they just handle things differently down there.Our cermony was on the beach and our reception was at the on site restaurant Olas y Arenas. We had 53 people at our reception and Zelma, the owner and chef, rocked the house with her food and bar staff. We had a great DJ and the party was on!!! Overall, the reception exceeded our expectations and Zelma Parra, the owner, was a pleasure! She makes great food and has a wonderful supporting cast who dealt with 50 or so Puerto Ricans from NY. She is a saint!!When this place gets the rooms in order and works on its customer service, it will be an undiscovered gem in a beautiful part of Puerto Rico!

<Content>Get away from it all Been to this property many times. The key to a pleasant stay is your own attitude. The common language is a smile and the people speak it universally. Lots of kool tourist stuff to do not far away including the Cave at Camuy and surfing at Jobos and Rincon. Happy Belly bar is right up the street for american style bar food. The pueblo grocery store is about a 20 minute Drive.We suggest staying clear of Isabela itself......Strange Vibe there.A great day trip would be to the lighthouse on the southwest corner of the island..........perfect half moon beach. The quietest cabins are on the far east side of the property on the far side of the Hau Family home. This area is also double gated for those concerned about security. Jan and feb are good months for whale watching and are the best months for surfing. A little rain each day but for the most part perfect weather.

<Content>Good for family My husband and I drove around the island and stayed at this property one night. I think a family would enjoy it. It's set up kind of like a camp. It is a gated property with casitas and condos that overlook the bay. There are horses, a small pool, a basketball court, a restaurant ( where we had the best food of our trip) and a small convenience store. The grounds are well-kept. Just understand that it is not a big, luxury resort. Each unit has a sitting area and one or two bedrooms and a small kitchen with full-sized fridge. The beach is coarser type sand with waves constantly coming in. You can snorkel a little but there's not alot to see. Walking the beach to the left, you come to the next cove, which is a nice public beach with another restaurant for burgers etc. We paid $140 for a king bed, sitting area and kitchen.

<Content>Great Times!!! We were looking for something out of the way, non-resort hoopla with just a bed and a great view and we found it at this place. The room was just ok, basic needs, bed, tv, table and chairs. We've done the big all-inclusive resorts and they sure are nice, but if you are looking for peace and quiet with a fantastic beach and great views then this is the place. We definitely would have loved some better amenites (updated kitchen), but the service Christina provided and the wonderful beach made up for it. We will definitely be back.

<Content>Prices went up and quality went down. We have stayed at the Villas del Mar Hau 3 or 4 years in a row, but have not been back to PR for 3 years. We were in for a shock.The first room they gave us for $124 had indoor/outdoor carpeting that was filthy, windows ditto, the whole room smelled moldy, or ? Spoke with another couple who had had a similar experience.We refused that room and got another with same window condition (looked like they hadn't been washed in the 3 years we weren't there). The draperies hadn't been opened in ages and were very dirty. But it did have a balcony view of beach, and a stove  frig.We left to visit Rincon for 2 nights and called the del Mar Hau to try to get out of the rest of our reservation, but they refused. The manager asked what was wrong, so I told him about the rugs, windows, draperies filth. And, they finally gave a room like we were used to, which now goes for $150. In other words they tried....I think they washed the windows and the curtains didn't smell that bad; tile floors, much easier to keep clean. French doors open out to beach, nice, yes, that's why we came back 4 times. The beach has good snorkling and swimming. Lots of surfers stay in the cottages and split the high cost. So, the owners/managers are relying on their incredibly wonderful location and beach to charge their high fees. While, quality suffers.We were there 4 years ago when they bought and were placing the NEW beds. We saw them do it. However, the beds did get pretty worn and uncomfortable in 5 years of frequent use. Also, they don't use mattress pads which help hold the sheets on and can be washed,,,,, so you hope that the sheets fit well enough so you don't end up sleeping directly on the mattress like I did the first night ,,,, not nice. And the restaurant...... whoa, gemme a break. It is common knowledge that the restaurant is no good. Eh food, and really bad service, as witnessed by very few people eating there. One example: fresh PRican bread is baked fresh and delivered everyday, almost everywhere (even the funky local cigar store/mini market). We tried the restaurant once more.... asked for some bread  butter to tide us over and received lousy whole wheat sandwich bread sliced in half with some weird roasted unfresh roasted garlic. Eck, we almost went back to our room to get our fresh bread.All in all, it is really a shame. We are realizing that it is better to stay inland for more reasonable prices and just go visit this beach, Playa Montones, and other beaches. Probably the same elsewhere too. See our positive review of Dos Angeles in Rincon.

<Content>Wedding group , International Travelers The location is great for beach fans looking for a place to relax and forget daily routines, not to american standards in service or customer attention. Laid back service at a laid back beach, almost like camping at a bungalow, no frills or thrills. Bungalow 21 was second floor, felt like a corona commercial you saw beach and no one else in your line of sight. one level bungalows are a little darker and warmer during the day, some AC units do not work properly, don't try calling for maintenance, water pressure on showers ok, not strong enough for some of my friends, we rented 6 units as a group, 2 were good, one look and smell funny, three were good for the price and location.They do have 2 or 3 stray dogs running, one was a little too agressive to not keep your eye on them near the restaurant. Restaurant was ok ,basic quality, better if you go to restaurants 3-4 miles. one iron for the entire hotel, wedding planners beware, wrinkle free comes to mind. Kid playgrounds and pool are ok, nothing fancy, needs updating. Game room or hotel store/vending area had nothing worth spending your money or time. The natural pool in front of hotel is great for kids or people afraid of open ocean, rocks near the beach are great for exploring and pictures. Not a Euro or American resort style, but island retreat for budget minded vacationers with nature in mind. Beach is great! 4 stars for the beach,2 for service, two for property, one for restaurant.

<Content>Great View not so great service We had been planning our 4th family reunion and thought it would be great to do in our homeland of Puerto Rico. We started planning April of 05. When we contacted the hotel and informed them that we were having a family reunion (with at least 7 - 10 families in attendance) we requested a special rate and the answer was a resounding NO. That should have stopped us right there but we decided that because of the location and the beauty of the surroundings it would be worth whatever the cost.We rented 9 homes in total (which by the way since we had booked so early we requested that we have as many of the houses one next to the other and they were not able to comply), There were over 40 family members and because we were given such a small time frame to book, several members could not make it . So, those members booked in area hotels and figured we could just go in and spend our time with our families even though we would have the inconvenience of having to travel back out again late in the evening. To our surprise, the first family that arrived wednesday night was told at the gate that they were not allowed to go in unless they were actually staying there. That our only solution was to call our family out to the parking lot to say hello.Had we even known that this was to happen, we would have NEVER booked with them since what good is a family reunion if the rest of the family cannot be with you.The next solution that they gave us was for our family members to pay $25.00 per day EACH person that wanted to come in for the day! Our reunion was from Wednesday thru Sunday!! After much discussion they were then KIND enough?! to lower the price to $10.00 per day.Now for those of us who did stay this is what follows: The houses were ok right in front of a beautiful beach. Our problems were; old kitchen equipment, toilets would back up, there were no fresh towels everyday but every 2-3 days, if you needed a clean towel and it was not your day to receive one, you had to pay $0.45 per additional towel. At the last minute we had 1 guest that could not get a room there and since she was travelling alone we thought it best that she bunk with one of us. We did not mind having to pay for her but it was ridiculous that what served as her bed was a twin size matter on the floor costing $45.00 per day... This was a simple mattress!!!!I could go on, but I want to leave the rest for my family to write about, which I am sure they will.It does need to be said that the location was breathtaking, the beaches were both adult and children friendly.As a person whom has been on several trips (as far a Brazil), for once I have been disappointed and in my own backyard. And believe me when I say that Puerto Rico is a truly extraordinary Island with the beaches, hotels and especially the warmth that our people can provided with their open arms and doors at all times. Sadly, Villas Del Mar Hau will not be seeing any of us anytime soon, BUT they will be hearing from us.

<Content>Rustic lodging on a beautiful beach My family of four just returned from Puerto Rico and a two nights stay at Villas Del Mar Hau. I must say that I made the reservation after reading Fodor's and Frommer's travel books, and they both recommended this resort. After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor I questioned if I had made the right decision. Well, this is what I can say after staying there. We were in beach cottage #12 (hot pink exterior). I would say it's very simple and very basic. If you are in need of a super clean, well appointed room, this probably isn't the place for you. For example, we soon discovered that there was a small lizard living with us and it would scamper behind the refridgerator when we came in at night. My kids made a game out of it trying to capture it. There also are dogs running around the resort area, which may bother some people. Our bathroom was small and the sink wasn't plumbed correctly so there was an odor present. We had to keep a wet washcloth over the drain to control the smell. The beds were marginal at best and the kitchen seemed dirty. The porch was very nice and spacious with a great view. The grounds were kept up nicely from what I saw. The sand between the cottages had been raked and the beach was very clean. The swimming cove is protected by a large rocky island and is nice for kids and adults alike. I would highly recommend that you bring your own snorkeling gear. We found other places around the island to snorkel and it was one of the highlights of our trip! My wife and daughter (6yo) went on a horseback riding trip at the villas with Anne and had a great time. A good value according to my wife. For dinner we went to the Olas y Arena  restaurant on the resort grounds. Apparently new ownership as of 1 month ago. The food was excellent but service was not very good. We happened to arrive during a busy time and it was apparent that they were understaffed. We had to wait for almost two hours for our food to arrive. This is very hard to do with younger kids. I ordered the Snapper (presented whole) and my wife had the Mahi Mahi. Both were very good. We would have ordered desert but because of the delay we didn't. If we go back to this area again I'd probably try something else first, but the location is hard to beat and the beach is beautiful. It was nice to have a guarded gate at the entrance and the workers stationed around the grounds making sure everything was safe and ok. Check in and check out went smoothly and there were no surprises.

<Content>Beautiful Location - Excellent Restaurant - Ready to Book a Week I was originally not scheduled to stay at this hotel. I had booked 2 nights at Ocean Front ([--])  after an uncomfortable (unbearable?) first night there I left. Thank god I remembered the name Mar Hau in the area  was able to book a villa at the last minute. This is not your average property,  that's a good thing. The hotel exhibits what is best in the Puerto Rican way of life -- relaxed, genial  proud. The restaurant is a certified Meson Gastronomico  has earned that certification. Fresh lobster  a bottle of rioja cost about 1/2 of what it would cost in the U.S.  was just as good. I would not hesitate to book a week there in the future. The surrounding area doesn't have much at all as far as attractions, but the Mar Hau property is the perfect place to relax.

<Content>Paradise Found As soon as we entered Isabela and saw the view we knew this was the place for us. Once we entered the hotel grounds, it was like a tropical paradise. The hotel staff went out of their way for us. We were upgraded to our own personal cabin overlooking the lagoon. Our cabin was two bedrooms with a living area and kitchen. Very cozy. There is cable tv in the living area and a/c in the bedrooms. We really didn't need the a/c for our visit, just open the windows for the ocean breeze. Don't be afraid to ask staff for anything, they are very accomodating. Housekeeping even did our laundry so we wouldn't lose out on beach time!Anne, who runs the horseback riding, was great! She took us out through the trails and gave us a full tour of the grounds.If you are used to resort vacations, this is not the place for you. If you are looking for peace, quiet and relaxation, this is heaven.

<Content>A place to relax This is a piece of paradise. I do not see how people writte horrible things about this place. They must have some kind of arrogance of what nature is all about.This is a fantastic place to go and relax forget the troubles.The sound of the ocean the wonderful breeze, you do not even need hot water nor air condition. The people are friendly and I recommend this place to anyone that likes peace and quiete.

<Content>Beautiful Beach, Overpriced Cabins I have mixed feelings about this place. The good: All cabins are located directly on a beautiful natural beach. You step out of your cabin and there you are, waves right in front of you. There is a little store on premises that was very convenient, a small pool (we never swam in it), horses to ride, tennis courts, and basketball courts. (Basically, think nice camp site). The bad: Check-in was hectic and we were unable to check in until 5:30 pm (check in is at 5). The cabins are outdated and without maid service, although they do stop by every 2 days to offer new towels. A notice in the bathroom requests that no paper products be flushed down the toilet (read: nasty tp in the trash basket with no daily service to remove it) If the price was less then I would say that I would definitely stay there again, even with all the gliches, because it is on a beautiful spot. But we paid $175 plus resort fee which brought it to $199 per night so I'm not sure.....

<Content>I wish I was still there... For those of you seeking the perfectly sterile, air-conditioned goodness of a Holiday Inn, please stay away from these cabanas. It's ok, I won't judging you. However, for anyone looking to experience paradise on an under-developed carribean island, look no farther. I am a native Floridian who recently had the opportunity to visit the island with my girlfriend and her family (all native Puerto Ricans). They booked the place and said it was fabulous, having stayed at Villas Del Mar Hau several times before. I was skeptical, so I looked it up here. Of course, after reading rather nasty reviews, I became worried. I didn't have much of a choice, however (as any of you may understatnd, I was outranked in the politics of Latin family...), so I went hoping to make the best of it. Was the room spotless? Not exactly. However, I'm a bit of a germ-o-phobe, and I had no problem. This was a beach cabana, with everything you could possibly need (sans food supplies - bring everything you may need, including toiletries. Drinking on the beach is allowed, too.) Think of it as posh camping, with a Fridge and kitchen cooking/grilling capacites, on the shores of paradise. I have never seen a finer beach! The water, the sand, the people - all was perfect. As to the complaints of previous posters - I can not agree. With regard to the pool, I have no idea. (Why go in a pool when you have an amazing, crystal clear ocean to swim in?) I had no issue with bugs, save mosquitos outside (bring your bug spray). There were certainly crabs about (charming!), though I found none in my room. And, we stayed in a 6 person cabana with two rather new model a/c units. We left the bedroom doors open to the rest of the place in the day with the units on, and it was nice and cool. At night, our room temp was downright cold.  I strung up the hammock I bought in Isabela on my front porch back home, hoping to recapture a little of the magic I found on the beach at Villas Del Mar Hau. I write this review only in the hopes that open-minded travelers will discover this enchanting spot. Beware Hilton-hoppers - It is not a resort. These are beach cabanas meant to be a charming and practical base for your island and beach adventures. If you're looking for the sterile atmosphere of Disney World, go to Florida. You'll be in good company in the charmless tourist trap that is Orlando. Thankfully, you will find little of that in Puerto Rico. This island, and Villas Del Mar Hau, are the real thing.

<Content>Our experiences at Parador Villas del Mar Hau Recently, from mother鈥檚 day to Tuesday I was induced to stay at Parador Villas del Mar Hau. We had a group from our families visiting, (my daughter, her husband, our 2 teen granddaughters and a girlfriend, all are Florida residents) my son-in-law鈥檚 mother from San Juan and his older sister that lives in North Carolina. We had a 鈥渃aba帽a鈥?for 5 and 2 rooms. The rooms and the 鈥渃aba帽a鈥?were fair in appearance when we arrived Sunday evening, but after further inspection they were dusty, later that night my daughter and 鈥渃ompany鈥?had to request to be moved to a new 鈥渃aba帽a鈥? small crabs and large cockroaches (the flying kind) were roaming around the rooms. All the bedrooms have air conditioners, and in ours also a ceiling fan. But the living area and kitchenette did not have ceiling fan or air conditioner and even in the early morning they are hot very hot and they stay like that all day long, even with all the windows open. This is May so that in July - August they will be impossible. The 鈥渞estaurant鈥?food is over priced for the quality it offers. The only thing that is good is the beach. The Puerto Rico Tourism Department that regulates and evaluates the 鈥淧aradores鈥?must take note and pay a visit to inspect the place and ORDER immediate correction to all the problems.

<Content>It was fun. I have been reading some of the bad reviews for this place, and quite frankly I do not understand those reviews. This place gives you a real feel of country/beach living. It sounds to me that these people did not understand the type of place they were staying in. This is a rustic, no frills, laid back place to chill out and take in the sun. The food was ok but everything else was great. My boys enjoyed the beach  the basketball court. My wife and I enjoyed the morning sun on the balcony and the great sound of the waves at night. It definitely is not a 5 star hotel but it was a fun place to stay in. As for the help I bearly had to interact with them but the times I did they were polite and helpful. If you want a place to hang out for a few days without thinking too much and relax - this place is it. My wife and I are planning to go back for a long weekend in the fall.

<Content>fair warning having not stayed at Villas del mar Hau I cannot comment on the location or facilities. What I can say about the Villas del mar Hau is based on their service, or lack thereof, which is bordering on fraud.I made a reservation this past April for the final nights stay of our 5th anniversary. In October I had to shorten the trip, which required canceling my reservation. The process was quick and simple. I was well before the 14 day cancellation window and the agent said that a check for the entire nights stay would have to be mailed to me instead of reversing the credit card charges.Two months, ten plus phone calls and four emails have all been ignored. When calling, one cannot talk to someone in administration unless between the hours of 8 and 4. When calls are made within these hours I have heard all sorts of reasons as to why the check has not arrived; system down, check cutting agents on vacation, it's in the mail, can you call back?. I was even hung up on once and when I called back there was no answer. On two ccasions when they said they would return my calls in 10-15 minutes, no call was returned. The four email messages sent to the hotel have never been responded to. I have now contacted my credit card agency to reverse the charges. I have also contacted the Puerto Rico tourism board to let them know just how one of the hotels in their paradore program treats customers. I recommend shying away from this hotel unless you do not value your money! Dealing with this hotel has proven to be one giant headache.

<Content>BIG Disappointment!!! What a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT for my family and I when we stayed at Parador Villas del Mar Hau. I should of listened to the bad reviews. They are all true. The place is a MESS. The rooms were dirty, hot and the toilet flooded the restroom every time we flushed it. The owners and employees are there only to collect money, definetly not to make the customers stay there pleasant. They did not care that we were having so many problems and didn't help much to make our stay any better. We tried to check out of this dump, but they would not refund our money. DO NOT STAY HERE!

<Content>I'm so glad I cancelled Thanks to all of you who wrotte a review about this hotel I cancelled my reservation on 9/2/05 for the stay on 12/16/2005, and I can't beging to tell you the frustration and the phone calls I'm making to get a refund of a deposit that they charged to my credit card without my authorization which I wasn't aware till I called to cancel.So far I had to get my credit card company involve in order to get the refund but everytime the company contact them they lied and tell them that they already mailed it. Not only is happenning to me but also to my two sisters who live in Puerto Rico and still don't have their refunds. I live in California but I'm originally from Puerto Rico and it is embarrasing to read your reviews and to find out that this type of business practice and bad customer service is true. At this point I don't care if I loose my deposit but I am very greatfull to all the people who stayed at this place and took the time to save the horrible experience to me and others. I agreed with everyone else who said that all good reviews of this place must be from the owners. As a puertorican I want you to know that we have great places to visit, but defenetly this is not the one you want for you vacation in PR. I'm glad I cancelled and didn't ruin my vacation back home.

<Content>it's true, all the good reviews are from employees Believe me any bad review you see of this overly expense piece of garbage its true, staff is rude, especially one of the girls of reception Alice or Alicita whatever her name is. There were dogs running all over the place, awful food, and crappy rooms. Puerto Rico is great and it has a lot of beautiful and exciting places, but as in any other country they always have that place that just [---]. Take my advice Don't go there.

<Content>Loved the place I had the opportunity to visit the parador villas del mar hau and I must add the place was really nice. The parador was beautiful, surrounded by the beautiful beach. The place was really economical for all which included, you have the opportunity to go swiming at the pool provided and eat at the restaurant that has an international menu, I can confirm the Shrimp Salad on a pita with a butter herb dressing very delicous. The beach which is on the outside of the cottages is superb, your at walking distance about two feet or less and just to be able to get away from your everyday hassle is conforting. Really you haven't visited Puerto Rico until you see this really beautiful hideaway spot.

<Content>All the bad reviews are true Don't ever stay at that place is a nest of cockroaches, is a dirty awful place. I want to get out of that place the same night i got there, the a.c didnt work, there's no water and the front desk people were very rude to me and my family. At house keeping the employees try to do their best but they don't have the right number of people to work properly for all of those cabins. I try to talk to the owner of the place (that by the way lives there)but she thinks she is God or something and i dont have the chance. And the restaurant ahhwwww, they offer a menu that they don't have, and if in front desk they are rude the manager of the restaurant (Dania) wins the prize of rudeness. When i finally have what i order the food was awful and not what i expected from the description of the menu. Puerto Rico is beautiful, look for another place to stay.

<Content>Expected more, got less July and August are not the months to visit this parador. The units are too close to one another, and sound carries. From the blasting music next door, to the woman moving furniture above our bedroom at 6 AM. What's this all about? Management is unable or unwilling to regulate its renters and therefore you have to put up with the luck of the draw. My hunch is that spring or fall might be better times to visit. The parador is on a beautiful beach, really, that is fairly empty once you walk away from the rooms.

<Content>Hated Parador Hau And You Will Too! HATED THIS PLACE AND YOU WILL TOO! I read the reviews and even called to ask them what was up with all the bad reviews and of course they defended themselves. What an idiot I was. People DO pay attention to all the bad reviews about this place or any other place you are thinking of staying because all are true!!! I learned from this terrible experience I had at this place. This is my description of this place - GROSS! DIRTY Rooms and grounds! BAD SERVICE! Owners would not talk to us about bad service (were hiding-I guess) Rude employees! Wild animals running around the grounds! Pool was more like a mud hole. I called the place next door, much nicer place and cheaper, but unfortunately it was booked. If you are thinking of staying here you better think twice. YOU WILL REGRET IT. I certainly did.

<Content>Nightmare at Parador Villas del Mar Hau I recently stayed at Parador Villas Hau and had the biggest nightmare of my life. I should have believed all these bad reviews on this web-site. I might as well have camped outside under a tree. It would have been much cooler out there and a heck of a lot cleaner. $90 worth of food spoiled in my refrigerator due to it not working properly. There is no maid service.....they only use the hand-out system and you have to change the sheets yourself so don't even expect to have your room cleaned. The office clerk denied me the right to speak to the owner, who happens to live on the permises, but is always in hiding to avoid all the people in the office waiting to complaint. Water and AC goes out atleast 2 to 3 times a day. Pray that you don't get caught in the shower with shampoo in your hair when the water goes out. Be prepared for a few hours of soapy hair unless you go rinse out in the ocean. Our water service finally came back on after 3 hours.My biggest nightmare was staying at this place inspite of the reviews that I read. I should have taken every one of these reviews very seriously. If you are planning to stay there, you should cancel while you still can because they will not refund your money or compensate you in any way. Bottom line...THEY JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, ONLY HOW MUCH GOES INTO THEIR REGISTER. PLEASE, read every single review and take it serious unless you just don't care about being misserable and ruining your family's vacation.

<Content>Horrible!!!! I do not know how this place is still in business, so many bad reviews. It's funny how the good reviews are from people in Puerto Rico, makes you wonder if they are written by the friends of the owners or employees. Anyway what a HORRIBLE place this is. Too expensive and very dirty! The air conditioners are in the bedrooms only and they don't even cool. No hot water, toilets overflow and we had to ask them to clean our room and give us towels. You'd think with so many employees that I saw working there that this would be a better place, but it's not. DO NO WASTE YOUR MONEY. Do not stay in this run down junkyard.

<Content>Grrreat Stay! I stayed at one of the Villas of this place with my husband and kids for 4 nights and didn't want to leave. This is a place in a secluded area with the most wonderful beach. The view specially at the sunset was magnificient. Our acommodations were superb with hammocks in a beach front balcony for total relaxation. If you are looking for a fancy vacation this is not the place to be ( it is a little pricey though) but if your expectations are to relax in a free natural environment do not miss the chance of visiting Villas Hau.

<Content>Any Bad reviews are true!! Good reviews must be from the owner/employees! This is definately a cabana hole priced higher than a four star hotel! A number of young locals running this place, the owner no where to be seen! The cabanas were not as pretty as the pictures! Air conditioners only in the bedrooms so the living room and bathroom were like being outside--we were literally sweating after coming out of the shower! You had to climb down a mountain of sand to actually get to the only nice thing there...the ocean! It was not at all what we expected...No electricity for a whole night, no water the next day, pool was drained, hungry dogs running around everywhere, staff was rude and inconsiderate...get this we bought groceries and when the electricty went out they kindly offered us their resturant refrigerator, the next day we went to get our milk and eggs and the staff had USED them!!... Our vacation started once we left this awful place! We stayed at a four star hotel for less, got great service, clean rooms, all that you would expect for the amount of money you pay!

<Content>Stay away!!!! My family and I spent a week in Puerto Rico. We stayed at Parador Villas Hau for four MISERABLE days. Rooms were DIRTY, HOT, and the restaurant served terrible expensive food. There is nothing good about this place. To get to this place is so dangerous, narrow winding, roads. Also I could not believe how many employees they have, mostly young kids that I did not know what their job titles were they just hung around doing NOTHING. When we went to complain about their terrible service, no running water, air conditioner not working, dirty pool, and clogged toilets all they did was pass the buck. We talked to one person, nothing got resolved. They would then have us talk to someone else. Bottom line nothing was done to make our stay there any better. I was very discouraged about Puerto Rico until we went to Fajardo. BOY what a difference. It was like day and night. My next visit to Puerto Rico will only be to the beautiful eastern part of the island. Culebra is awesome! STAY FAR, FAR AWAY from PARADOR Villas HAU.

<Content>it is the place yeah! I don't know what were looking for the people who wrote bad things about mar hau. Ive been there about 5 times, and (not lately because of work), but every since the first time I went there, I came back because of the same apart feel. If I want 5 stars, I would go to a resort. This is different, is private, sensual, and at the same time can be familiar. Just magical.It not a new and perfect place, but perfect is where you feel like.relax, enjoy the anti-city ambiance.be cool.

<Content>Worst place I ever stayed! DON'T STAY THERE! The bad reviews about this place are ALL true. We had NO RUNNING WATER for a day, our TOILETS WERE CLOGGED, which explained the plunger located under the sink, the grounds were FILTHY along with the swimming pool, DOGS running around on the premises. The GREEDY OWNERS, who live on the premise, do not want to be bothered with complaints, instead they tell their employees to lie to the tenants about their whereabouts. We wanted to check out on the first day, but they would not refund our money. They said only the owners could authorize a refund. We tried for four days to talk to the owners, but we never did, one excuse after another. I have traveled to many places and this is by far THE WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER STAYED!!!!!

<Content>Hated the Parador Renter beware! These villas are not what they want you to believe. Don't believe anything the receptionists tell you! Just got back from Puerto Rico and could not wait to tell you about this place. I had reservations for two nights and coudn't wait to get out after the first night. The so called villa I stayed in was depresing. Dark, dirty, rust on every metal surface. There was a hole on the floor and I tripped everytime I entered the teeeny weeeny bathroom as the tiles were sooo uneven. The bedroom ceiling fan had missing lightbulbs and had a build up of about an inch of dust. I complained was told they were full. There was no attempt to send somebody to at least check out the villa. The so call awesome view I was promissed was blocked by palm trees and local vegetation. The cable tv was terrible - only three channels worked and were very blurry. I had to leave. The receptionist told me she wasn't authorized to issue a refund. On top of it all there had been an overcharge of $80 to my credit card during check in. After a week of calling 3 -4 times every day I was told that they would only refund the $80 and that I lost the one night I did not sleep in the villa. Also they won't issue any refund to your credit card. I was told I would get my refund check in 30 days...

<Content>shabby but beautiful beach My family of 4 stayed here in the first week of January 2005. The beach was beautful, and the water warm enough to swim in--but the waves were too large for small children. the surf looks spectacular and beach was not crowded in any way.The hotel is badly maintained--peeling paint, chipped walls, single light bulbs in the room, non-existent maid service. People at the front desk were not very helpful, although they were not actually hostile.The on-site restaurant is mediocre. The hotel posts signs describing many available activities, including horse riding and beach volleyball. Each activity costs extra, and we did not see some of the stated activities anywhere.

<Content>Beaches I've stayed in one of the cabins the past 4 years. While I think the accomodations are terrible, it would be hard to find a better setting. If you go, expect a somewhat dirty, barren cabana to stay and cook in but a spectacular setting.
