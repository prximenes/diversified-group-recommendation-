<Content>Perfect location, real style. We stayed in Amsterdam for the weekend for a blend of business and pleasure. This hotel is wonderful and is in the authentic heart of Amsterdam - it was great to walk out of the hotel and feel the pulse of the city immediately.The design of the hotel is just exquisite. It underlines the true sense of style that the Dutch are renowned for.The size of the rooms and the comfort of the mattresses left a little to be desired... when you stay here you realise you're paying for the location and the fantastic design of the hotel - i sleep anywhere usually but found myself tossing and turning on both nights due to the mattress.Our stay at the hotel felt like a real treat, but it has to be said an expensive one. We both left feeling we had shared a special experience and would recommend the Dylan to anyone who wants to splash out.

<Content>Top of the range! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The Dylan is fantastic, so stylish and yet the atmosphere is friendly rather than stuffy...Reception is very cool, and we were checked in straight away, no wait. The receptionist then brought us to our room - no. 13, on the second floor - and our bags were brought to us 5 minutes later.Our room (standard) wasn't particularly big, but had 2 huge windows looking onto the neighbour's gardens, flat screen TV and Bose sound system. Well stocked minibar, safe and bathrobes standard. The bathroom was the same size of the room, with a lovely stone sink and bath / shower, and also had a huge window.The bar and the restaurant are lovely, and so is the patio - although we didn't get to sit outside. The service is excellent!The Dylan is located in a quiet, residential area, yet within easy walking distance from lovely restaurants, bars, cafes, museums, etc. The many little cafes and restaurants on Prinsengratch canal are wonderful for people watching.We loved the Joordan area too for restaurants and nightlife. A lot nicer than Rembrandt square and Dam Square!

<Content>The Dylan is superb Just had a night in the Dylan on business, but stayed there all day having meetings. It manages to be cool and stylish but not up itself or trying to be something it isn't. Service was superb, the room (a garden view suite) was huge for a city like Amsterdam, and the food excellent. Seriously beautiful building, too, in an amazing location. OK, my room was 750 Euros for a night, so it's not cheap but if you want something special, go there. I go all over the world on business, this is one seriously world-class hotel.

<Content>Europe麓s no 1 boutique hotel We had the pleasure of spendning 3 night麓s at The Dylan in May 01-04. We reserved two completely different roomcategories, one stadard duplex. The duplex has a minimalistic white design, spacious with bathroom on the second level. We also reserved the Manhattansuite, Hempels masterpiece and personal replica, 45 sqm. The Manhattan is a designersdream, black  gold with beautiful woodenfloor in dark Mahogany. The Suite is located on the second floor with 5 magnificent large windows facing the Zen garden, draped with hundreds of meters of tafted silk. A lot of heart and compassion was put in to the Manhattansuite when it was designed, no question about that. Recently FG Stilj made a fantastic job remodeling all public areas. Fantastic and very tastfully done. As the owner of TDG Design Group and with a lot of exerience in hard design, i will give The Dylan a 5 out of 5, this is without no doubt the best boutique hotel in Europe.Finally, maybe the most important Dylan access:The staffKind, helpfull and always one step a head. We are looking forward staying at The Dylan soon again,Best RegadsP.G. Tor茅us(Sweden)

<Content>Great hotel, great location, great service! We stayed in the Dylan for two nights in May and I couldn't recommend this hotel more. It is very centrally located (close to main shopping, restaurants, sights) and the styling and decor are top class. The rooms are luxurious and spacious with a well equipped bathroom (although shower did have some hot/cold issues). The main positive I have about this hotel however is the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. Great for a short stay, although its central location means it lacks some of the facilities you see in top hotels (pool, spa etc).

<Content>Loved the place!! I was booked to stay in this hotel and was apprehensive given the scathing remarks in other reviews. Nothing could be farther from the truth. It is a lovely hotel and the staff are bunch of wonderful people who went out of their way to be nice and do the needful to make my stay comfortable. (I did see them quietly ignore a rude guest. I guess the moral is - if you are nice, people will be nice in return, rudeness begets rudeness!!) The room is rather small for the price, but remember that you are in Amsterdam where space is at a premium. The bathroom was a revelation and the larger hotel chains would do well to take a few cues from the Dylan on the subject of creating lovely bathrooms. Both the room and the bathroom were well equipped. The complimentary internet access is excellent. The hotel is located in a wonderful area in the centre of Amsterdam and is a short way away from the main attractions. For a 41 roomed hotel, it is very well known in Amsterdam and the locals hold it in high esteem. A taxi driver will have no problem in taking you there (If he does not recognise 'Dylan' tell him to take you to 'Blake's; which is the old name for this property. The public areas on the ground floor, the lounge, cafe etc. are chic and smart. They come across as being sophisticated and classy without being loud or flashy. In fact, nowhere is the hotel brassy, flashy or loud. Each bit of this wonderful hotel is elegant.

<Content>Great Hotel despite naysayers My booking was made with some trepidation as I had read some scathing reviews here. We stayed four nights and booked two rooms and I have no complaints. The staff was very professional and accommodating. The service in the restaurant was incomparable. The only issue I has was when I asked the concierge to book a table for eight one evening at a nearby restaurant, somehow we were all given the price fixe meal when we would have preferred to order a la carte. Both rooms were well equipped with ample soap, toiletries and amenities. The public rooms are particularly lovely and make for a great meeting place.

<Content>Too Bad, was hoping for a great experience! How dare they claim to be a luxury hotel. Was booked in the Kimono suite. Towels were frayed and thread bare. No clock in the room and only one bar of soap. Booked the museum package, the website is totally misleading. They offer tickets to the museum of your choice on line, but upon check handed us tickets to the Van Gough and told us we had no choice! When I said I had no use for those tickets the extremely rude and arrogant manager attempted to toss them in the garbage , I found that action disrespectful not only to me but to society. What point was he trying to make? I stopped him and and suggested that he give them to a person who could not afford to go to the museum.The service in the bar was appalling, empty glasses were left on the table as well as dirty ash trays. Again, not the type of service one expects in a bar where they are charging 17 Euros for a drink!This hotel needs to give it's staff a course in customer service.

<Content>A fabulous location for a fabulous hotel WOW - glad i didn't read the reviews on this hotel before I booked! i either stayed in an entirely different hotel or there was an alignment of sun, moon and stars when i stayed......! location as many others have said is great - in the nice part of amsterdam. we had booked 2 rooms for 3 nights, including new years eve. i didn't notice the 3pm check-in time but when we arrived they said they had noted our flight arrival details and had our rooms ready - they had also upgraded us. we were 2 girlfriends travelling and they gave us adjoining suites which was very useful. before we arrived i felt i was being stalked by their concierge who seemed oddly worried about our restaurant bookings....thankfully, i gave in and got him to book something for us.....if i hadn't, we would have had a real problem since so many restaurants were closed. the reception team could not have been more helpful/accomodating - my upgraded room had an unpleasant smell (drains - not that surprising in amsterdam i guess but not nice), i told reception about it on my way out to dinner. they said they would have someone look at it and if it wasn't fixable they would move me. when i returned, they had another room ready for me in case i wasn't happy with the repair. the smell had decreased but was still there so i said i'd see how things were the next day......the next day on my way to breakfast they asked if things were ok (without prompting), i said all was fine but nevertheless they had the maintance guy check again. these things happen, what is important is how the hotel deal with the problem - i felt they handled it perfectly. breakfast was a very enjoyable experience - agreed service was a little spotty but it was high quality and very friendly. decor i really liked - quirky and definitely designed but that's what they advertise. only negative i might point to would be size/quality of rooms vs price.....we were upgraded but even in the upgraded rooms i thought price vs offering was slightly off. nevertheless the overall experience more than made up for this and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel or to return - it will be my base in amsterdam going forward. friends staying at other high end hotels all much preferred my choice......

<Content>Mixed feelings Stayed at the Dylan for one night. Location was great and the hotel looked fantastic. Room, whilst small, was funky and well equiped. We felt, however, that the staff were singularly disinterested in making us feel welcome. We had cocktails and snacks included in our package but found only one person running the bar who complained constantly about how busy he was and had to be prompted to produce anything at all. We were charged for breakfast (also included in our package) and had to wait 45 minutes to check in.Other problem was that the communal rooms were wreathed in cigarette smoke.Would not stay there again purely because of the poor staff and cigarette smoke.

<Content>Shabby Formeley Chic When it was built it was chic reminded me of Morgans in NY. Today it is shabby chic. However since then they have ridden their laurels, first room I thought the maidhad forgotten to clean with the meager what looked like a half eaten cookie she left. Chipped bathroom tile rings aroung sink, and a toilet that didn't work properly. My room overlooked and overheard the conversations of the interior court garden. Demanded a new room that I got the 2nd noght which had been remodeled as was satisfactory.Pros good quiet off street location, nice morning breakfast and as much as hate to say it, the rate of $350 euros was less than other hotels in this star range.Would I stay there again, no but I would have to do some home work to find a replacement

<Content>Totally Not Worth It We travel a lot--and know good hotels--and this is not one of them (especially for $550 p/night). From a staff that allowed us to wait for 3 hours in their lounge without offering anytihng--to a manager that promised to make our late check-in right for us--the experience at the Dylan was far less than it should have been. Once we got to our room we had a toilet that didn't really flush anything, a warped bathroom floor, no place to put things in the shower, badly draining shower, and just plain cheap badly performing everything.I tried working with them--but the best they would do is to give us 2 espresso's and comp our bike rental. Not exactly what I would expect for this kind of money.There have to be better places to stay in Amsterdam.

<Content>Fantastic boutique hotel ! Having read some of the other reviews I'm beginning to wonder if we stayed at the same hotel ! Many places advertise themselves as boutique hotels but fail to deliver, the Dylan certainly does deliver ! The location is fantastic, right on one of the major canals close to the centre and in the nice part of town. Reception is certainly different, with the standard desk being replaced by a more friendly and welcoming large table for everyone to sit at. We were offered a free upgrade to a suite (which was nice !) and this was huge, with fantastic creaky wooden floors and a classic decor, it felt like staying in a palace. There's been some comments on bad design, well its a historic building and like practically every other old building in central Amsterdam space is an issue, which is why the rooms are not like an airport Holiday Inn. To me the narrow wooden spiral staircases give the place character. I was definitely a fan of the bathroom sink, which looked more like a Roman fountain. Certainly no complaints about the service either, which was polite and forthcoming, a real rareity in Holland, which in general could be considered as being one of the least service-oriented countries in the world. The cocktail lounge downstairs was perfect, good cocktails being an endangered species in Holland.OK its not cheap but no hotels in Amsterdam are. And it can be a little noisy with all the creaky wooden floors, but drink enough cocktails and you won't notice !Generally this hotel delivers what is promised and deserves its place amongst the Leading Small Hotels of The World.

<Content>Badly designed Hotel I have contradicting feelings toward this hotel. The hotel ground are very nice. Nice lounge and bar. The staff varies from very competent to not so. Concierge Michael is great. We had duplex room. The room looks cool at first glance. But then you realize nothing in the room makes sense. Who ever designed the rooms should have there license revoked. First our bed was on the first floor but the bathroom was on the second(via spiral staircase) which is very nice especially at night. Water splashes from the sink, no mirror next to the sink, water spills out off the shower, toilet dos not flash well. Closet(or whatever it is) is a joke. Cheap furnishings. The price is way to high.Of-course location is great. It is right on the canal in the center. There has to be something better for that money.

<Content>do not stay here! The staff failed to pass on numerous messages from me to my husband; consequently he thought I had absconded with all the luggage! In fact as the suitcases were quite heavy I had asked for them to be taken down by the staff; this didn't happen and they were still in our room when he eventually persuaded them to look. They also said I had left my stuff all over the room; they didn't apologise when this turned out not to be so. They didn't apologise either for not passing on the message that I was going to be late. The shower controls were out of reach and there was no bath. The shower leaked into the corridor between it and the loo. There was no room for 2 people to use the bathroom mirror at once. Usually you get a long vanity area with a basin and a work suface under the mirror, so one can shave and the other can put her make up on ... but not here! I suppose Annouska Hempel doesn't like to be seen putting her make up on.There was no bedside table or light, so you had to get out of bed to turn off the light and you couldn't read in bed without disturbing your companion.Breakfast was expensive and you had to pay extra for cooked.

<Content>Stolen Things My Partner and several friends went tothe Dylan for a long weekend, April 18-22, 2007. Our group had the best 3 suites in the hotel. The hotel is nice enough, but we had all of our personal electronics stolen from our room. Computer, mobile phones (2) Ipod and some small money. The response from the hotel was suprising, the acted as if it were the only time this has ever happened and if we had not locked the items in the safe it was our own fault. For the rechord, the safe is not large enough to store a computer of any kind other than a PDA and now i read on this site that they have had this come up in March. We were offered the phone number to the police, that was all. so while the hotel staff is friendly and the rooms are unique, loosing all of your personal things is not a pleasent expierence particularly irritating is the loss of the computer..

<Content>poor value, good location The Dylan has a wonderful location, within walking distance of almost everything you'd want to go to and nestled in the interesting 9 Streets area. There is a lot of staff, ranging in competence from very high to very low, generally coolly impersonal but always polite and attempting to accommodate clients' needs - from printing out documents to getting train information. Internet access is available in the rooms at no charge. There are nice towels, robes, slippers, and toiletries. The hotel is highly designed - actually, so highly designed as to be contrived. It has enough drawbacks that I'd advise booking a different hotel if the price to quality ratio matters.The hotel is in love with the colors terra cotta and black. Black works well in rooms that are large and get a fair amount of sunlight. It works badly in small rooms with little natural light. But the hotel uses the same palette regardless of size and light availability.I occupied 3 rooms over a 4-day period. Two of them were luxury singles (19 and 6); they should be avoided. At 325 euros, they are exceptionally poor value.One room was a double (41, in the new annex) and was excellent, with a few qualifications: no bedside reading lights, no tub, a soiled slipcover on a chair, a window very difficult to raise and lower, only a single small ledge in the shower enclosure. Those may sound like significant qualifications but they are minor compared to the problems with the luxury singles.Number 19 is on the small side; the walls are painted with deep horizontal bands of terra cotta and black and curtained with a heavy material using vertical terra cotta and black stripes. The curtains puddle on the floor but are so heavy that instead of puddling they drape in an ungainly fashion. The bed is a fourposter. The room is overpowered by the furniture, which also includes two rattan armoire-type cabinets flanking the bathroom. But the real problems with the room were a toilet that flushed very sluggishly, finding 3 squares of toilet paper a trial; flaking paint in the bathtub where the shower attached to the wall; a shower curtain that was dirty at the bottom; light switches that could only be reached by sliding one's hand between the wall and the armoire; a television that faced a bedside table instead of the bed; a door to the bathroom which could not be slid shut because it ran into one of the armoires.The staff apologized and courteously put me in another room - 41, a double - when I asked for one that was more comfortable. That room wore its black and white theme well, got copious sunshine, and was spacious.Because someone else had booked 41 I moved again to a luxury single, number 6. This room seemed even smaller than 19, appeared cheaply furnished, and was extremely depressing because of all the black and the absence of natural light. Here too the toilet labored.An odd feature of the tubs is a marble ledge which runs around them. The ledge is nice, because you can put things on it. But if you want to lie in the tub for a good soak, you have a problem with that ledge which juts out over the back of the tub. A doubled-over towel ameliorates but doesn't completely solve the problem. This is one of many small examples of overdesign that reduces comfort.The buffet breakfast was 25 euros and was tasty, if overpriced. It is very easy to eat in the neighborhood instead.

<Content>A waste of money... We stayed here during our European trip some months ago and were bitterly disappointed. The staff were somewhat standoffish and service was not good. We had to carry our own bags from the kerbside to the hotel - seven heavy suitcases. On other occasions they were less than helpful.The hotel has been cheaply renovated and the owners apparently regard the style as contemporary chic. As a result, the prices of the rooms (and everything else) were outrageous. We were awoken at 7:30 am every morning by the construction crew working on a nearby structure. Some rudimentary double glazing and/or soundproofing of rooms during refurbishing could have prevented that intrusion, but no such luck! The food was above average but the portions were small and we quickly tired of the same old cold cuts and exotic fruits for breakfast. Like everything else, the food was ridiculously overpriced.Despite the fact that we didn't make any sort of mess, it took the cleaning crew three trips to service our room and the Do Not Disturb sign was routinely ignored.We'll never stay at the Dylan again!

<Content>All lugage stolen from room - Beware My partner and I decided to stay at the Dylan Hotel for a weekend due to the fantastic reviews on the hotel. I cannot fault the service we received from the staff until we had our luggage stolen from the hotel including passports, house keys, car keys, clothes shoes etc.... The hotel only paid for a taxi to the Police Station where we were then expected to look after ourselves. From a hotel of this calibre I find the service we received disgusting. I am trying to get some compensation out of the hotel with no luck so far not even repayment of the taxi fare. Although this is a beautiful hotel and I enjoyed my stay I would steer clear of this or any other hotels in their chain if they cannot even take care of very simple things like guests safety and luggage. Having spoken to the police on the night of the theft apparently over 10 couples had the same experience over the weekend.

<Content>Fantastic hotel The hotel location was perfect on a beautiful canel with shops and places to eat around the corner. I was slightly apprehensive about the staff having read a previous review, however, booked as was impressed by the hotel photos. The staff who greeted us were very friendly and all staff we came into contact with during our four night stay were polite and friendly, nothing was too much trouble in their eyes. We only ate bar food at the hotel one night, choosing to eat at local restaurants instead especially due to the hotel prices, however, the food we did eat was to a high standard. The hotel rooms did not disappoint from the photos we had seen. We had a loft style room overlooking the canel, the room was beautiful and very relaxing to be in. Yes the hotel is more expensive than others but a fantastic experience and well worth visiting.

<Content>Boutique-like, classy but snotty! I love boutique style hotels which is why I booked this place and it WAS lovely. We stayed in a loft style room which was more like an apartment! There was loads of room, sofas and a bed the size of Holland! Upstairs (which made it even more like an apartment) we had a beautiful bathroom and to top it all the location was perfect.....walking distance from the centre.BUT although really nice, if you keep in mind the price of staying there, the phrase ...well it should be kept springing to mind.I had forked out a fortune and was expecting alot. I've stayed in fair amount of boutique hotels so feel able to make a fair comparison.What really let this place down was the staff......you never got the feeling that nothing was too much trouble. They just weren't all that warm and friendly.If you want to go and stay, I'm sure you won't be disappointed but bear this review in mind - then you definately won't be.

<Content>Best place to stay in Amsterdam! The last time my husband and I visited Amsterdam, we did not stay at the Dylan, but we did eat dinner there... and had a beautiful meal. We thought the next time we returned to Amsterdam, perhaps we would like to stay at the Dylan, given that it is in a great location, has a cool vibe, and, as we discovered, the food was fabulous. So return to Amsterdam we did this November, and we stayed at the Dylan. After reading the reviews here of it (some negative, some mixed, amongst good ones), we were a bit hesitant, as it is pricier than other hotels. But we are so happy that we decided to stay at the Dylan! We stayed in an amazing room facing the canal, and the staff could not be any nicer. As it was our anniversary, the hotel gave us a gorgeous bottle of red wine to celebrate. The room and the hotel are so wonderful, we bearly left our room, which was HUGE and bright and airy, very zen-like. (Since we had done most of the sightseeing last time we were in Amsterdam, we just wanted to relax and spend time with each other this trip.) We highly recommend the Dylan - for the hotel as well as the restaurant!

<Content>Fantastic boutique hotel If you're heading to Amsterdam, treat yourself to this luxurious boutique hotel. You won't be disappointed. The Dylan is listed among The Best Small Hotels of the World for good reason. I'm a regular business traveler who's stayed at some pretty amazing places, but this was right up there with my favorites. First, the location is perfect -- perfectly picturesque. The Dylan sits on a quiet street facing one of Amsterdam's flowing canals. You're just a short walk from most major attractions -- incredible museums (like the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum), the historic Anne Frank House and the famed Red Light District. The small alleyways nearby feature plenty of nice shops, pubs and cafes. My room at the Dylan was small but appointed beautifully. I walked in to a classical music serenade and immediately slipped under the sheets to rest up from the transatlantic fatigue. The room had many conveniences -- great bath products (I'm a sucker for Molton Brown), fluffy towels and a nice sound system. For about 40 more euros a night, my colleague enjoyed somewhat more lavish accommodations (her room was larger and looked out on a lovely courtyard), but there doesn't appear to be a subpar room in this hotel. We visited the city on business and benefitted from the free wireless Internet access throughout the hotel. The restaurant is lovely, but I hear the food doesn't measure up to the decor. So, skip the meal, plop down on one of the lounge's cushy sofas and enjoy a cocktail. It's a great way to unwind after a busy day in one of Europe's most beautiful capital cities.

<Content>Quirky but it grew on us. My girlfriend and I needed to take a break and chose to go to Amsterdam for a long weekend. We looked at a lot of different hotel web sites, and finally settled on the Dylan hotel. It is a small hotel with about 40 rooms in the center of Amsterdam. The hotel itself is a combination of 2 or 3, 17th century building joined by a lovely courtyard, and tucked away off the street.When we checked in we were met by a friendly hotel staff who then took us to our room. We had booked a suite, which ended up being a large loft style room, built into the roof itself. To gain access we walked up a very narrow spiral staircase. The room was very casually decorated in neutral tones with wicker furniture. It had the feeling of being at a sea resort and not in the center of a 17th century city.The lighting was a little odd, there were many small spot lights in the rafters pointing up into the ceiling. While it made for a very dramatic setting, they were not the best for general uses, like reading. The room was separated by a small wall, with a dining table on the living room side. In the sleeping area there was a large queen size bed with a TV at the foot of it and a headboard. On the opposite side of the headboard was a trough style marble sink. The bathroom was off the bedroom and consisted of a large tub and a separate shower. At first we really didnt like the room, but over the weekend it started to grow on us a little. It wwas so quiet and peaceful. When we woke up in the morning and looked up into the rafters, and heard the birds and the cool breeze through the window, it was really nice.room service was right on time, although they continued to mix up the orders. I think we made housekeeping a little nuts, as we tended to sleep in and left after the morning housekeeper finished for the day. There is was also free wi/fi in throughout the hotel, a nice touch. As far as the restaurants go, we did not have the chance to try it, as it was fully booked. We chose to explore the neighborhoods, and got great recommendations from the concierge.The city itself is amazing, a 3 day weekend is not enough time to properly explore it, and we look forward to returning next Spring. Would we stay at the Dylan again? Yes I think so, but I think we will shoot for a different suite next time.

<Content>Honeymoon stay at The Dylan I'm truly shocked at the bad reviews on this hotel. We just got back from the Dylan and loved it. We spent a few nights of our honeymoon in Amsterdam at The Dylan and from the moment we arrived we loved it. The design is gorgeous. The front desk guy was so helpful and welcoming. Our room was large and gorgeous. I loved the decor - very Danish Modern.There was a bottle of Crystal Champagne and snacks and a note from the staff congratulating us on our marriage. The concierge was our lifeline for everything we did. So helpful with restaurants and where to go and how to get there. They gave us change, made dinner reservations, we rented bikes from them and rode them all around at night. Highly recommend doing that. It's located in the heart of town on a beautiful canal so we walked everywhere from The Dylan. They also called a cab for us to get back to the hotel. I found the service at the front desk excellent.There are some design flaws the other reviewers mentioned like the sink faucets the water kinda spills out in a weird way. We had to duck down to see ourselves in the mirror which would make shaving very hard. The plumbing is old and the pillows were a little hard. The breakfast spread is nice, but the service was realllly slow. I found that everywhere we went in Amsterdam. It's not a service oriented culture. So, The Dylan's breakfast staff was just about as slow as the rest of the city's.Overall, If you're an older tourist type of person, this hip hotel is probably not for you anyway. It's expensive and has a bar and outdoor lounge where people can drink and smoke late at night. Which we loved. So, if you are a cosmopolitan couple like us, you'd love The Dylan.

<Content>Over Priced, Over Designed, Disapointment What a disapointment this hotel is!There is so much more to a trendy boutique hotel than just a beautiful building and unfortunately this is the only thing going for the Dylan. Hotel staff were very dismissive, to the point of ignoring you when you are actually standing in the reception room. We had early check-in booked as we were on an early flight, however the room was not ready until almost 3pm, none of the staff offered an explaination or apologised for the inconvenience. Check-in to the room, only to have house keeping come in about 10min after arrival to re-stock the mini bar, explaining they had not had time to do it yet, but would do it now so we would not be charged for missing items. Unbelievable.The rooms whilst supposedly designer chic, are ridiculously over designed. We had the kimono/japanese inspired room which required you to bend over to see into the bathroom mirror, sit on your knees to have a shave, or use the small shaving mirror which was located on the adjacent wall, but the lighting cast a massive shadow which made this useless. The shower dribbled against the wall, so we got the maintenance person to put a new one in, only to find it was equally useless. The rooms have a table and chair at the end of the bed, or a couch, located directly under the plasma tv on the wall, again useless. Not really designer chic!We expressed our concerns to the hotel manager who advised we could not be moved on out first night, but he could change our room on the second. Not wanting the hassle we opted to stay in the existing room, and having spoken to other guests it sounds as though the other rooms are equally overdesigned, although we did not see them first hand.A really disapointing, overpriced hotel. Definately not worth the money. Would not stay here again.

<Content>Exceptional Dylan I lived in Amsterdam for 4 years, so coming back is always special for me, particularly when I'm bringing a friend with me to impress them with my favourite city. I know WITHOUT QUESTION that service can be dreadful in Amsterdam, but I cannot criticise the service in The Dylan. Not only is it excellent (and helpful) but it made this particular 5 star make you feel as it should do - relaxed, pampered and valued. I have read the other reviews from guests who were 'concerned' about the size of the rooms, but the reality is you're staying in a beautifully restored property, so no, they're not going to be palatial in the standard size - this is the architecture of the period, but I challenge any guest to find a more beautifully renovated house on the main canals that offers the same quality. And service. I loved the 2 nights I just experienced - the service, the room, and the location - and would recommend that if you want to see Amsterdam at its best (it's in the Jordaan so the quality area is where you are), you need to book in. Remember old in Amsterdam sometimes means small, but the best presents . . . . . .

<Content>A disaster Our bedroom overlooked a courtyard where guests partied until 4:00 or 5:00 am. The windows were not double glazed, so we got no sleep.The hotel may be billed as a designer hotel, but little thought seemed to have gone into the bathrooms. Our shower delivered water vertically downwards onto the tiling at thee nd of the bath, and had no thermostat. With one hand holding the shower, and the other hand constantly adjusting the temperature to the varying water pressure, one needed to ask a friend to perform one's ablutions!The designer window blind disintegrated on use.Breakfast was an exorbitant E24 for a coffee, orange juice, and a few rolls.

<Content>Appalling from check-in to check-out This hotel bills itself as a deluxe hotel. The design is brilliant and totally impactical. Lights that do not work / baths taking 20 minutes to fill / service that is so amateur that you wonder where they get their staff. Room cleaned at 5.00 p.m. / staff walking into your room at 8.30 a.m. unanounced. The list is endless and more interestingly noone cared. If you want service then don't waste your time. Make sure that you don't leave your bags at reception as they stuck lables all over it that has left a permanent mark. From check in to check out a total disaster. Good value at 50 Euros not 400 Euros.

<Content>Wonderful hotel and staff We were not sure what to expect at The Dylan after mixed reviews on this site, but we were not disappointed. The hotel was stylish and beautifully looked after, our rooms were a delight, and the staff were wonderful - everyone from the receptionist, to the conceirge, from the room service guys, to the restaurant staff, were friendly and could do not do enough to help. Every request was taken care of with perfect politeness and a smile. The restaurant at the hotel was excellent and we would recommend it. In room breakfasts were vast - way too much for a couple, but delicious. The hotel building is unusual and corridors are long and winding - but that's just a quirk of staying in an old building, and one we rather liked. We went with friends - our rooms were next to each other and they were totally different and unique in their own way - we prefer this to the blandness you can experience in some top hotels. We felt spoilt staying here which made for a very enjoyable, relaxed time in Amsterdam. We'd definetly go back.

<Content>Great, eccentric but click hotel I read one of the below reviews expecting the dylan to be past its prime after the changeover from ANoushka Hempel, shabby rooms, etc but was very pleasantly surprised. I went to amsterdam, a city i love and have visited many times for work and for pleasure, with a new partner - we were really surprised by the polite and professional (not at all snobby) service, great room service, great cocktails in the bar, and best of all, a great room. Booked a cheap (鈧?30) rate off the internet and was expecting a broom closet, but the room was very nice, large (by Amsterdam standards), loads of character, clean, kept-up-looking, just very very cool. I'd not hesitate to recommend the dylan especially as there are not too many options in AMsterdam for characterful, stylish hotels.

<Content>Stylish property for a city trip This is a chic and special property, converted from an antique Dutch bakery (I believe) so the architectural construction is unique. This allows for interesting rooms (we had a duplex suite), but also some inconveniences like you need to be no taller than 5 ft. to look into the bathroom mirror. But for us, it was a weekend stay for pleasure, so we dealt with it. The thing about Dutch service, and I preface the following sentence by saying that I'm totally generalizing and appropriating stereotypes (half of the staff is probably not Dutch, but even still...), the guest does not feel like s/he is a VIP, but rather a friend or an acquaintance. When we checked in, the concierge had no problems telling us that the property used to be the Blakes and since it became the Dylan, he has seen the quality of the guests drop (!). Well, I hope he wasn't refering to us....... smileLater on we borrowed hotel bicycles to tour the city. The staff volunteered to waive the rental charge without us asking (that was nice of them), but then when we came back, he said with a measure of scorn in his eyes: oh you're back late. We felt like maybe we should have insited on paying the 15 euros! The location is excellent and we loved the breakfast (not included in the rate). The aforementioned casualness of the Dutch staff is a plus in another way since you feel very laid back and easy around them. In other words, if you like more formal service, then the Dylan is probably not for you. But if you want a place that is chic, good to people watch and admire old Dutch architecture, then it's a good place.

<Content>A very good hotel.... but not brilliant staff!! My wife and I stayed here for two nights commencing 20th December 2005, we found the hotel on the 'Mr  Mrs Smith' website (If you don't know this is a collection of luxury/sophisticated boutique hotels. We have previously stayed in hotels belonging to this group and have been blown away by both the veneu and the service. Upon arrival at the Dylan we were met by two very friendly and welcoming 'hosts' who following a pleasant and informative tour of the hotel led us to our room... we stayed on the top floor and in excellent room, four poster, fairly large bathroom and all round funky decor!!!Unfortunately the bar/restaurant staff were very rude and dismissive, making us both feel very 'out of place' to the extent we cancelled our dinner reservation!!!All in all.... Good but not that good!

<Content>Great hotel, shame about the theiving staff! We stayed at the Dylan for 3 nights. On the face of it - not bad at all. Nice little hotel, staff could have been bit more attentive but nice nonetheless. Our room was very well decorated although it was a little small and there was nowehere near enough room to hang clothes - bit of a problem when there are no ironing facilities. Hotel is very well located.We had a marvellous time, as we always do in Amsterdam. The hotel was very pricey but it was a treat so who cares. Sadly our stay was ruined when we left the hotel. I (stupidly) left a bag full of duty-free cosmetics in the bathroom cupboard. With hindsight thank christ it wasn't jewellery. We checked out mid-morning and left our bags ready for collection later that day. I realised I'd left my goodies and thought (as with every other half-way decent hotel) they would have been handed in by housekeeping. Not so! I explained what had happened to the staff and they really couldn't have cared less. There was no sincere apology and they didn't seen surprised or concerned at what I as saying. They couldn't wait to get rid of me as their new victims were checking in and hearing my complaint. No resolution was offered - nothing...and we had just spent a fortune at their hotel.I am disgusted and would NOT recommend this hotel to anybody. Absolutely shameful !!!!

<Content>one of the best hotels in europe The Dylan was one of the best experiences I've had with the hotels in Europe.Very luxury car waited for us ont he airport, warm welcome at the reception. We got the perfect room on the first floor, with a canal view. Perfectly designed (Anoushka Hempel style, as all blake hotels), biggest and greatest bed I've ever slept on. Perfecty lit room. Didn't have air-con problems :)The staff is very well trained and pleasant - they all look good in very nice uniforms, they're always smiling - and the best thign is that you don't see'em most of the time, but the're always there. Even if you get out of you room for 15 minutes, when you come back you find everything clean and proper, and you don't get to see any of the staff.You can even find an eye-mask and anti-hangover stuff in the mini-bar.The restaurant and the food are perfect, very nice and big selection. Pricy, though, but that's the thing with all the good hotels. At least here you get really good stuff for your money.

<Content>The Dylan (Watch Out) Just returned from a two night stay at the Dylan Hotel (formerly Blakes) and it was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. Maybe that is the reason why this property keeps changing ownership.Mark my words......do not even consider this hotel if you expect any comfort.The first night the room was visually appealing upon entering but were everything from the drapes to the sheets to the towels were dated and filthy. The room was completely unfunctional as well, shower was awful and nothing in the room worked properly. (and I mean nothing). The flooring was made of a material you could not walk on barefoot. It was 75 degrees outside but management felt it was not necessary to turn on the air conditioner in the rooms. My room was a complete sweat box and sweated thru the night. When I called the front desk to change rooms I was told there would be a $400.00 upgrade charge because the only room available that night available was a suite. The next morning I immediately went to change rooms for the next night and they put me in another room. This room again was decent upon first inspection but again had no air-conditioning. We were forced to leave the windows open for air and the mosquitoes were awful and kept us up all night biting us. It was worse than camping out. Once again, nothing in the rooms functioned properly and upon closer inspection of the stuff in the room, this new room was outdated, stuffy and overall of poor sanitary standards.The General Manager of the hotel was off on vacation and I still have not gotten any explanation or apology for this nightmare of a stay. You would figure after the first night of a miserable stay, management would have put me in a room that was somewhat comfortable.The staff could care less and I advise you all to stay away from this property.I also stayed in the American Hotel in Ledspelein and it was significantly better.The Dylan needs to be torn down and rebuilt from scratch if it wants to be thought of as a high end hotel.

<Content>Not a cool hotel... in any respect. Given the rates and adverstising for this hotel one would at least expect basic luxuries like air conditioning. Do not be deceived. They will say that their rooms are air conditioned. Most are not! They have some sort of fan that blows, but no cool air.They twice put me in rooms that they claimed had air conditioning, only for me to find out that the staff had lied. Eventually they placed a portable unit in my room for one night and moved me to a room that was barely cooler the next night.Additional bizarre details include the fact that you need to be four feet tall to shave in the bathroom mirror. Any taller and you will find yourself looking into a cabinet, not a mirror. That is, of course, if you manage to get enough water flowing out of the sink, or shower, to actually manage to wash.The hotel looks cool from the common areas and is a joke when it comes to basic utlities in the rooms. It is great to be in a cool hotel, but not when it is falling apart. Additionally, the bar and the restaurant were lame. In my 5 day stay I never saw a crowd or any semblance of what could be described as a scene.Save your money and stay somewhere else. This is no luxury hotel.

<Content>Nice food, nice service - shame about the tatty rooms! What a disappointment. Having become familiar with Blakes in London, and stayed in other five-star hotels in Europe i was expecting a lot more. Very friendly staff, welcoming you with a lovely ginger and lemongrass concoction, but after that slightly downhill. Our room was superficially nice, but in need of some redecoration - paint was coming off, and the furnishings looked very worn on closer inspection- no choice of pillows either - they're all feather, which is not ideal if you suffer from allergies as I do. I've been offered a choice of pillows by four and three star hotels in the past. Nothing is complimentary in this hotel - everything in the mini-bar has a price tag! Not what you expect when you're paying over the odds - all we got were three apples, a bottle of what looked like tap water and two very small chocolates!The food in the restaurant is divine, but hugely expensive - definitely over the odds - expect to pay at least 150 Euros if not more for a meal for two. The decor in the restaurant and bar and reception area was faultless, but the slightly rarified atmosphere of the hotel is a bit much first thing in the morning for breakfast - not necessarily the most relaxing of experiences. A real lack of facilities in terms of spa or pool as well - I've been told they are dealing with the latter issues.On the whole would probably not stay again I'm afraid! Although I understand that a change of management (the hotel is now called 'The Dylan') is likely to improve things.

<Content>Excellent service and food Stayed here 3 nights in March (it is now called the Dylan) 2 nights in a superior room with canal view and last night in a duplex suite with canal view. The staff were excellent, they knew our names and were friendly and helpful. Really enjoyed the fusion food in the restaurant. The breakfast was good as well, although a little annoying when you pay an inclusive room rate and find this only covers the basic continental breakfast and all fruit, yoghurt, eggs etc are payable extra. The rooms were a little disappointing, I have to agree with one of the previous reviewers that they tended towards design over practicality. The design is quite stark, rather than romantic. Having said that, the beds were very comfortable and the baths huge. We had problems with our shower, hence our upgrade to the duplex suite for the final night. The bed in the suite was one of the most comfortable I've slept on with superb bed linen. There were DVD and CD players in both rooms. The location was very good, within walking distance of all major attractions, but away from the noisy areas like Dam square. I would recommend this hotel, especially when the new spa facilities are built.

<Content>amazing service From the moment i checked in i knew this hotel was special. I was greeted with champagne and a pleasant staff willing to accomodate me even though i had no reservation. The room was amazing. Max, the conceirge, thought of everything including giving me an umbrella for rain was in the forecast. The hotel thought of everything so that I wouldnt have to. The service is amazing even if some of the design is a case of form over function.
