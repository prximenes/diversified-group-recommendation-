<Content>Loved the Gothic Ambiance This place is so central to everything that it is great value for your money. It is a good 10 minute walk to the Firenze Train station, which is ideal.As soon as we got to our room, it was quite dark and (as my mom would put it) looked too Gothic. However, when I opened the windows and the balcony doors, the room was quite spacious and clean. I kind of like the rustic appeal, actually--I don't know what my mother was talking about.I had just come from a business trip in Bologna and was carrying pretty big luggage so the fact that the place has a lift was very helpful.The check in area is quite small and can get pretty crowded when a whole family checks in.Breakfast is just hard, cold bread with butter and some orange juice. But who can complain when your staying for 60 euros a night?The view in our room of the Duomo was fabulous and breath taking. If your room has no balcony, don't worry, the terrace at the top floor is excellent for looking at the same view.The bathroom is quite small, but it is very clean and does the job.

<Content>A basic little hotel... I usually get a weekend trip to Florence in Oct/Nov time and normally stay in the Brunelleschi - however, this time my three friends and I were on a tight budget so opted for this hotel. I have to say that it was clean and basic. The roof terrace was terrific. It was quite cold when we were there and we asked for extra blankets because the rooms were cold. There were not enough extra blankets to go around, although the staff were apologetic and very friendly. Our room looked on to the back of the Savoy and we were wakened early with linen trucks clattering about. Again, as other people have mentioned the shower-rooms had a weird and small layout. This is a good hotel option if you are concerned about price or you're only going for a couple of nights. Needless to say, i'll be staying at the Brunelleschi again next year....

<Content>What a view This hotel is situated in the heart of Florence. The rooms on the sixth floor are surrounded on two side by a roof terrace which offers magnificent views over the city. The rooms on this floor, we have stayed there twice, small but clean. Breakfast can be taken in the dining room or you can ask for a tray and take to the roof terrace.Being so close to the Basillica the bells early morning, especially on Sundays, do give you an early morning alarm call.

<Content>Exactly what you pay for.... We arrived at the medici hotel expecting next to nothing seeing as we'd got it for such a reasonable rate. the location is absolutely superb- roof terrace looks right across the duomo and other sights of florence. as you step out of the hotel you are on a busstling piazza with lots of restauarants and bars nearby. everything from the hotel is pretty much a walking distance.the rooms were very clean we were fortunate enough to have an amazing view from ours however the shower is very small, water pressure isn't great when you're so high up and after showering the whole bathroom does tend to become drenched.Don't expect too much from breakfast. it's basically a hot beverage, some tuscan bread (very dry in general- nothing to do with the hotel), some butter and jam. Staff are v friendly and helpful. we lost our key and they gave us a spare and didnt charge us for the one we'd lost.if i were to visit florence again i'd definitely choose to stay here. it's amazing value for money and a great base for exploring this fantastic city.

<Content>Nice hotel with the greatest situation Nice and clean hotel near the Duomo. The bells of Duomo gave a nice morning wake-up at seven o麓clock.The room wasn麓t too big but there was room enough for two people and our stuff. The wiew from the 6th floor to Duomo and cupola was really beutiful. You could buy a bottle of Chianti to the terrace to enjoy the wine and the wiew.I would recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>Exactly What I Paid For I wanted a basic hotel that was clean and in a good location and I got just that with Hotel Medici. Now on the website this hotel boasts of a wonderful view of the Duomo, but I didn't get that view. I believe you had to be on the 5th floor or higher. The staff was descent, but became friendly when you spoke Italian. It was a noisy hotel, because the walls are thin as paper. I could hear most of what my neighbor was doing. All in all, it was a descent hotel for the price I paid.

<Content>Brilliant Location This is a very average hotel. But it is in a very good location. it is few steps from the Duomo. It is about 15 mins walk from the main train station. Because of its location it can be a hassle getting to the train station as the area is flooded with tourists.The room we stayed in was very small but clean, it had no T.V. but when the location is so good you should spend all your time outside. The staff are very helpful and there is no problem with the language when you are communicating with them.

<Content>Excellent area but watch out for Room 101! We arrived at this hotel on Easter Friday when it was pouring with rain and the temperatures were much below the average in Florence at this time of year. Our one hope was that we would get to our cosy hotel room and warm up but unfortunately this was not the case. For a two-star it is what you'd expect, small, boxy and basic: small reception, quiet and unassuming concierge who speak good English. It's one distinct advantage is the beautiful and spacious roof terrace. However, our room (room 101) was on the first floor next door to the kitchen and cupboards and also right next door to the TV room and dining area. This meant that we were adjacent to the booming TV next door and were woken at 5am by staff setting up for breakfast and all sorts of slamming of doors, staff walking around, and talking. You would think that they would be conscious of guests in that room but they are not - this room should not really even be a guest room as it is freezing cold (heating comes on at 3pm) does not have proper curtains or shutters and carries all the noise on the first floor. However, when we asked to change rooms, the staff were accommodating and accepted it with indifference. We packed our bags and they moved them for us to a room on the 4th floor. It was certainly warmer and had proper shutters, but the bathroom was a toilet/shower combination. Again, this is a 2 star so really that wasn't bad. I was impressed to find all rooms have good hair dryers and provide extra blankets although the towels are questionable so bring your own!Overall, it wasn't a bad hotel especially for those who don't plan to spend a great deal of time in doors and it is in an excellent location, just avoid room 101!

<Content>Roof terrace revisited We stayed here 8 years ago and found it pretty basic but well located. Its saving grace was a superb roof terrace over looking the Duomo. To sit here in the evening looking out over Florence, drink in hand, was a delight. Had a look round again and it has been smartened up quite a bit decoratively but otherwise plain simple and adequate for the money. If you are expecting all mod cons, TV etc this is not for you.

<Content>Well, I suppose liveliness needs a counterpart I find it a bit strange that all the negative reviews are being marked as unhelpful. Either the voters work for Hotel Medici or they're fanatics of everything Florence, in which case their votes are biased and shouldn't be taken seriously. Admittedly, the location is fantastic. It's right by the Duomo (Cathedral) in one direction and about 10 minutes to the train station in the other. Walk a bit and you'll find a bunch of pizzerias and other nice places to eat, and walk some more to find the nearest convenience store. Basically, you don't have to do much to survive since everything you need is a few corners away.However, although the location is fantastic it does overshadow the flaws of the hotel. The people behind the front desk were helpful in the sense that they knew where everything was, but they were a bit unpleasant and at some parts of the day it seemed like they didn't really want to talk to us. They don't greet you or even acknowledge your presence when you go in and out, which is actually quite amazing since the lobby is about 10 feet wide. We never felt welcome, simply because we weren't welcomed to begin with. When we checked in, the only thing he said was dokumente (passports) before snatching it out of our hands.But the front desk is really nothing to complain about. I remember there being one nice guy who smiled and didn't make us feel unwanted. But the room itself had a few problems. For example, it was cold most nights and the heaters only worked a few hours in the evening (from about 9 to a little after midnight). Eager tourists fall asleep to a toasty room and wake up to a freezing cubicle. And it's not like it matters anyway, there's no way to adjust the heater. I would've called the front desk for help but they probably would've eyed me grouchily and sulked all the way up.The next thing is petty to complain about, but I came in expecting a TV because the hotel details said so. However, upon closer inspection I realized my voucher said SOME rooms were blessed with a TV. And SOME rooms were blessed with a hair dryer. I was lucky, I got the hair dryer. Too bad I'm bald.Mind you, I'm not a spoiled traveller by any means but whatever I'm used to has no effect on how I review this hotel. It's just how I would compare it to the other hotels I've been to. I only stayed in my room when I was sleeping so I didn't really mind what the hotel lacked. It didn't even bother me that it lacked so many things. But the one thing that bothered me was how much the people working there seemed like they didn't want us around. Makes a bad impression for the Italians, you see, since most tourists head straight for the hotel before seeing the sights.

<Content>Exellent Value For Money We just returned from our holiday in Florence. When we booked the hotel we weren't expecting much since it was advertised as a two star and the price was really ridicolous (just 鈧?5 per night) but when we got there we were positively surprised!It is located in the very centre of the city just round the corner of the most prestigious hotel of the area and very close to the most popular sites. The rooms are small but clean and warm, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly. The breakfast is a bit poor but what can someone expect at such a price?We strongly reccomend this place to whoever wish to visit Florence

<Content>Find a different hotel This was the last and by far the worst hotel we stayed at in Italy (or anywhere else in the world). I wouldn鈥檛 stay here again if they paid me to. All the other 2 star hotels we stayed at in Italy were decent places. Note - they list themselves as 2 star, but TripAdvisor lists them as a 1. Freezing in the rooms and breakfast room. The only warm place is where the receptionist works because they have a nice new portable heater there. They told us the heat is turned on only at night 鈥?that seems fair for conservation purposes. However, as it turns out, that means only from 8pm to 1am. The room takes at least a few hours to warm because the heaters are old, and even then the temperature barely changes. We woke up the first morning to a room temperature of 17C/63F. When we complained they offered to move us and to give us a small heater (which didn鈥檛 work). When they gave us a different portable heater (circa 1940), it was in such bad shape that it blew a fuse for the whole floor. After tramping around in the cold wet winter climate all day you want a reasonably warm room to come back to.Note to summer guests 鈥?there are no air conditioners in the rooms either.Regarding complaints, the staff/manager/owner are indifferent or annoyed that you have dared to complain. They really don鈥檛 care.This hotel is extremely noisy outside. Understandable since it is in a central area, but all our other hotels had double paned glass which cut down on the noise, whereas Hotel Medici did not. We hardly slept a wink in 4 nights.The only 2 star hotel with no safe or tv in the room.Other guests are extremely noisy for some reason 鈥?loud talking in the halls at early/late hours, screaming children. The walls are thin.Heard many others complaining at the front desk of cold rooms, being charged for things they didn't break, etc.The rooms look nice which gives the website a deceptively nice look but BEWARE! It is recently renovated but it's only a lipstick reno.

<Content>Absolutely loved it!!!! We were told its a 2 star hotel so we were not expecting much. Not even a TV in the room and a very small bathroom. But what it lacks was made up by the location which was just absolutely BRILLIANT!!!! Smack in the middle of Firenze's shopping district and some historical landmarks.Excellent value for money. Strongly recommended for tourists. The lack of a TV in the room was all made up by the various distractions which was practically at the entrance of the hotel. Unless you really need a TV in your room, Medici Hotel is a must stay hotel.

<Content>Fabulous Location This is a small, family run hotel.We stayed for 3 nights and found all the previous reviews difficult to comprehend!!!! The hotel has clearly been refurbished and offers great value, low cost accommodation in the centre of Florence. OK so sharing a bathroom is a drawback, but the location more than makes up for it.Will be returning.

<Content>Do not book this hotel for at least 5-6 months!! We arrived to what can only be decribed as a building site!! After we picked our jaws up from the ground we asked a builder what was going on....he directed us through the reception (without hard hats that should have been supplied, as the place was so dangerously derelict) downstairs to the hotel manager whose seat was a bag of cement!! The manager explained that as we could see, there were some refurbisments going on to which we reminded him that he said no such thing in a phone call to him on previous day to see if everything was in order. He went on to tell us that there was an apartment available for us two streets away, we voiced our utter dissappointment as we were travelling with a seven month old baby (4 adults) but as we were so tired we took the keys. Apartment described as follows:1. Two flights of stairs to the elevator.2. Baby's buggy did not fit in tiny lift, so one person had to walk up the FIVE flights with buggy.3. Padlocked kitchen door, the electrics were faulty so kitchen was out of bounds!! There was no way to feed the baby.4. Management became quite aggressive with us during a few instances when we went to complain. 5. We were given breakfast vouchers for a little cafe beneath the hotel where we had to STAND for breakfast as to sit down at a table would incurr a charge to us!!We managed to muddle through the five nights having purchased our own kettle to make bottles. The reason we booked this hotel was because of the roof top terrece where we had invisenged ourselves over 5 wonderful evenings sipping wine  taking in the breath taking views that this beautiful city has to offer. instead we were stuck in a rather ramshackle apartment with what can only be described as mediocre on a good day. We did however receieve ONE night free by way of apology, which again is highly dissatisfactory.

<Content>Good Location but No comfort here. Location spot on but as soon as you walk in, trawl those stairs to reception at top of building you know it aint the place for a romantic week for two. To be fair the sheets where clean but that was it. It is the bare minimum you would put up with. Its a bed for the night and lets not hang around in the morning hotel. Its cheap as chips and the old saying 'You get what you pay for' is spot on here. We took a chance and at 拢90 for two people for three nights I have little room to moan. For that price in one of the best locations in Florence what does one expect. Its acheap travellers hotel. Don,t go stay for a treat.

<Content>Fantastic location for price! I stayed in a single bedroom with shared bathroom facilities  breakfast included for 45 euros a night. The location of this hotel is so central and why I chose to stay in it . The views from the top of the hotel on the 6th floor terrace are fabulous- lots of great photo opportunities. The breakfast is simple and the hotel is very basic but for such a reasonable price, I thought it was great. I could go out sightseeing, do a bit of shopping and then drop the shopping at the hotel before heading out again. If you just use the hotel as a base it's terrific. As for the dodgey lift people keep mentioning: I only used it to go to reception (on the 5th floor) or the top terrace. My room was on the second floor so I used the stairs. There's stairs everywhere in Europe so you have to get used to that. The hotel is only a ten minute walk from Santa Maria Novella, the main train station. I would not recommend having a hire car while you are there as there is no parking. However you don't need a car because you can get to all major sights on foot. Florence has very strict car access laws anyway, no matter which hotel you stay in. If you are someone who likes staying in a fairly nice hotel then this may not be for you but if your looking for budget accommodation in an awesome location- go for it  enjoy the amazing city of Florence!

<Content>A nice older place to stay This hotel is obviously older and the lift can be challenging as can the bathrooms. It is a good value and the location is great..the Duomo and Baptistry are right at your footsteps.The rooms are not sound-proof so if you like the sounds of people walking by, scooters rushing by, sweepers cleaning the streets, early morning garbage trucks, and store openings--this place is perfect.The breakfast was simple--bread and coffee or hot chocolate--but it was good.The bathrooms are teeny-tiny and the shower is directly over the toilets so be ready to have the entire bathroom wet after the shower.I would probably go there again because you really get an older, rustic, Italian experience.If you are looking for luxury...look somewhere else.

<Content>One of the best value hotels on Earth!!! I can't believe the bad reviews this place is getting. I paid 40 Euros a night, in August, for a double inc breakfast (shared bathroom) for a hotel 50 metres from the Duomo, with a roof terrace overlooking this amazing building.OK, the rooms were a little spartan, but were clean, with nice high ceilings and a comfy bed. Never had any problems getting to use the bathroom (though one per floor might be is a little tight!).Breakfast was OK (typical Italian style, so not at all like Northern Europe or the States - more basic) but make sure you let the staff know you've gone in the Breakfast Room!Staff spoke adequate English and were freindly enough - much better then many Italian Hotels (or other countries for that matter).It can be a little noisy when roads are being cleaned or the bells ring, but many city centre hotels can have this problem.All in all, for the price I don't see how it could be better!

<Author>A TripAdvisor Member
<Content>the old bait and switch I've done a lot of travelling over the years, been to a dozen countries and we usually try to stay in smaller family-run hotels, so I'm not a spoiled traveller by any stretch, but I wouldn't recommend that anyone book the Hotel Medici. When I found the Hotel Medici website, I was amazed to find such a nice place in the center of Florence for so little money (the Hotel Medici website claims it's two stars, the Trip Advisor page claims one star, and Orbitz claims 3 stars). The place looks beautiful, and the central location made it perfect. We started to suspect that something was amiss when one of our party tried to talk to someone about arranging parking. They were told six separate times to call back in an hour for most of a day. Once that was sorted out, we were on our way. Arriving by taxi from the airport, the driver unloaded all of our luggage onto the street in front of the hotel. We lugged our bags into the lobby to find that the reception desk was on the 5th floor! So we had to get all the bags onto the tiny elevator (there was only room for one person once the bags were loaded). After a lot of effort, we managed to get the stuff up to the lobby... where we were told that check in time was after 2 PM. That's to be expected, but they make you put your luggage in a public hallway, not any kind of secure room, while you're waiting. When we returned at 3, we were told that our room would be in a sister hotel around the block, apparently because they were overbooked. I had booked and paid for the room months in advance, so this made no sense to me. We once again got all of our stuff down the tiny elevator after much effort, and lugged it all down the street and around the corner to Hotel Maxim. Another tiny elevator, another reception area (this time on the 3rd floor), our room down the hall, around two corners, up the flight of stairs, around two more corners. When I asked about the broken AC unit in the room, the receptionist got all huffy and told me it was between me and Hotel Medici because they (Hotel Maxim) were doing us a favor by letting us stay there at a reduced rate. We did manage to get them to give us a second fan. The 90 degree night was unbearable, even with two fans. No view of the Duomo and no rooftop terrace. Bait and switch, plain and simple. According to the reivews I read of Medici, the Maxim was probably nicer, but the lack of AC made it a long, dreadful, sweaty night. Do yourself a favor and find a place with AC if you're in Florence in the summer, and avoid Hotel Medici at all costs because you never know where you will actually stay.

<Content>This Hotel is horrible All the bad reviews are true. Stay away from this place at all cost. Check in is on the fifth floor. You lug your luggage to the top just to find out that room is 4 blocks away in a seperate building. The lady at the reception desk speaks no english. She hands you a key a map to your room ( not in English ) and sends you on your way. Our room was dirty, and on the 5th floor of anouther buiilding. The street outside the room was cleaner. There is no AC and the fan did not work. We were also bitten several times from multple types of bugs. We forked over an extra 200/per night to stay in a real hotel. Please, please, stay away.

<Content>Great price, great location Don't let the fact that wealthy American students can't handle ancient lifts deter you from staying here. We found this hotel at the last minute and were delighted with the location - you seriously can't beat being this close to the Duomo. Our room was huge and clean, and breakfast was just fine! If you want romance and luxury, this place isn't it - but it's great if you're in Florence to see Florence!

<Content>Excellent location/budget accommodations I had booked a single online and was given a huge corner room that contained a king sized bed, a twin bed, and a couch. Despite this and a few other large furniture pieces, the room was practically empty! The hotel was in a great location, just outside a busy piazza with tons of shopping and restaraunts. It was only about a 5 or 10 min walk from the train station and all the major sites were within easy walking distance. On the 6th floor was a beautiful terrace. The Duomo was so close, you could practically reach out and touch it. It was worth the price of the room just to be able to come up here and to relax and to be able to enjoy a glass of wine along with the spectacular views! I only have 2 complaints about the hotel. First, the elevator was extremely slow, especially during check out times. It only fit about 2 people at a time and was almost impossible to catch unless you took it from the 5th floor (where the receptionist and breakfast room are located) or from the ground level. Secondly, if you are a light sleeper, then this may not be the best choice for you. The street outside is often packed with people and outdoor cafes, so it can be fairly noisy. I went out most nights, so this wasn't really an issue for me. Also, being so close to the Duomo is a mixed blessing. Let's just say that you don't need an alarm clock. I found that it was impossible to really sleep after the 8 am chimes; so if you like to sleep in late, this may not be the best choice for you, either. Breakfast wasn't anything fancy, but it was nice. Waitresses brought you a basket of fresh, crusty rolls with jam, biscotti, and coffee. There was also fresh lemonade, an orange flavored beverage, and water. It was plenty to tie me over until lunch. Overall, I was very happy with my stay here.

<Content>OK for a Budget Traveler This hotel was OK for a budget traveler- we stayed here in a room with private bathroom for $60 U.S.- but if you can afford to you might splurge a bit more. Our room was very bare bones, but quite large. A lot of student groups were staying here, and noise travelled a lot, so it was a bit loud. There was also a lot of street noise all night. On the plus side of the noise, one night there was an opera perfomer singing in the nearby Piazza della Republica and it was beautiful.We were also without hot water one morning, but on the days with hot water the shower was lovely- great shower pressure. The continental breakfast was decent and the service was friendly. For the price, we were pleased, but if we were staying longer we probably would've gone somewhere with a few more comforts. By the way, the view from the upper floor balcony is as spectacular as it looks on the website.

<Content>Would NOT Reccommend I am a 20-year old student, and all I ask for on my travels is a clean place to stay. On my arrival at the Hotel Medici, I was immediately disappointed. Like the other reviews have stated, the location of the hotel is ideal, but I would highly reccommend staying elsewhere.The elevator in the hotel works, but it is quite scary to use. It is very old-fashioned: you open the door to the elevator to enter and the shaft is like a wire cage. The cables are not hidden from sight, and I had quite an uneasy feeling everytime I had to take the elevator. We could not get it to work upon arrival, and had to walk up to the 7th or 8th floor to check in. The staff was not very helpful either. Our room numbers were in the 30s, and they ended up being on the first floor behind an unmarked door; I had no idea how they expected us to find it on our own.We had a double and a triple room. The double room was straight out of the 70s, but it had a sink inside which was nice since the only bathrooms on our floor were small, dirty, mildewy communal bathrooms. I could hardly move around the small space without brushing up against the mildewy shower curtain. The triple room was a bit larger and spacious. But, there were two single beds and a cot, so I think this space was intended as a double room. There were no TVs in either room, just the bare essentials. Thank goodness I brought towels with me, as well, because the towels they provided were like bed sheets. I could not wait to get out of the hotel everyday. Breakfast, like the other reviews said, consisted of stale dinner rolls. I had a few bites of mine and then decided I was willing to spend a few euros to get something edible. Florence was GREAT, but I would never, EVER stay at this hotel again. It is a great price, but I think something better could be found for the money.

<Content>What a location for a price! I spent 7 days in this hotel during my Italy vacation. Every single time I stepped out on the street I was amazed with quality of the location in combination with a low price. When you are staying in Florence, you definitely want to be close to Duomo and / or 2 main piazzas (Republica and Signoria). This hotel is right in the middle.We were 2 adults but somehow we got a big room where entire family could be accommodated. I have seen a few rooms in this hotel and they are all very different in size and quality - so keep that in mind. Bathroom was shared, but is was very clean and used by guests from only 2 other rooms.Breakfast is not the best but the terrace on the top of the building is awesome. Elevator is antique and most of the time does not work. Our room was on the first floor so we didn't care. If your room is on higher floor (hotel has 6) it might be a problem. Staff is not overly firendly but serve the purpose. I'd still stay there again any time - for the location, cleanliness, and price.

<Content>A throwback to the era of the Flintstones I don't know what I was thinking to take my chances with this hotel. I just couldn't believe it could be as bad as others have stated and let's just say there has been no exaggeration in these reviews. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by an ancient elevator that fit max 4 people. We managed to barely fit three plus our luggage. one day my mother walked down the stairs and got to the ground floor before we were able to. Keeping the doors to the elevator open required at least the manpower of three people. As 1 is needed to keep open the metal door, and 2 are required to hold back the two swinging doors that swung in to the elevator. We broke into a sweat just getting our luggage into and out of the elevator. But I actually had a nice experience with the staff there. They weren't extremely attentive, but the woman that worked the reception always had a smile with me. THe room was basic basic basic. Beds, linens, broken down furniture that you would walk right past at a garage sale. They need an extreme makeover. It reminded me of a nunnery. You have to share the bathroom/shower with the entire floor. luckily, our floor was very empty, we had access to the bathroom whenever we wanted. You had a very small room with the toilet on one side and across was the shower head, nothing to separate the two. So when you showered you got the toilet seat wet. There's nowhere to leave your dry clothes, so you have no choice but to leave it on the toilet, my clothes got wet every night. We dreaded the shower every night. We didn't even try the breakfast. we got a glimpse of the mystery juice and wondered how anyone can take their chance with it. I couldn't even make out what color it was. It was like a yellowish, orange-brown. Ewww. I rather pay for breakfast and now what I'm putting into my mouth. The towels had this dizzying smell. It was thinner than paper towels and everytime I put it to my face the smell almost knocked me out cold. It smelled stale, if that's possible for towels to smell that way. It gets sooo noisy around 5:30 am, which is the time I get woken up every night by the dump trucks that smash glass on the spot or something.You go on vacation to live get away an enjoy a new city, why stress yourself out by staying in a shady place like this. treat yourself better and pay a little more to stay somewhere decent.

<Content>Awesome Location Fantastic little hotel located in the heart of Florence near the Duomo and shopping areas. We booked online (very good and easy to use website) and arrived on foot from the train station. We found it easily and were impressed by it's location. The hotel is certainly not 5 star by any means - a tall block with central stair way and lift. The rooms are comfortable, and very clean. There is no TV. The bathroom is very small and when you shower the whole bathroom gets wet including the toilet and sink. We found this a novelty rather than a hindrance!! The shower was great. The best thing about Medici is it's location and price. We paid 55 EURO a night in mid December for 2 people, including a basic breakfast (coffee, bread and jam, toast etc). For central Florence i doubt you could do better. To give you an idea, the hotel is right behind the Sofitel (5 Star Hotel) and near La Rinascente shopping area. Stones throw walk to Duomo, Uffizi, Palace Vecchio. Plenty of restaurants within 5 minutes walk, as well as a great Gelato place around the corner.Slightly noisy at 6am due to street sweepers but this was brief.We loved Medici and will go back for the price and location. Yes it is basic, but how much time do you really spend in your room as a tourist anyway?

<Content>Good for a short stay; great location; affordable I stayed in this hotel with two friends. We had an apt. few blocks from the main hotel. Room looks like an atic but it was comfortable. Price for the room was good if you do not want to spend a lot of money. Location was great; walking distance from the main sites. Breakfast is simple but enough to start a day. The view from the terrace is perfect. I'd stay here again.

<Content>somewhat disapointed We were quite surprise to go to the hotel to find out we didn't have a room at the hotel but at a appartment building 3 blocks away. So here we were at night in the dark and pouring rain trying to find this place in some dark alley, very disapointing to say the least. We found it after asking strangers for direction. The room had no windows and very stuffy. Our only bad room in 10 days in Italy, would certainly not recommend it.

<Content>Not worth it! Spending two weeks traveling France and Italy, I was really looking forward to my visit to Florence. Unfortunately, Hotel Medici ruined it for me. The hotel staff could not have been more inhospitable - and I speak Italian very well, so it certainly wasn't the language barrier. Although my room was spacious, it was freezing. In Italy, no one turns on the heat until November no matter how cold it gets. And my windows would not close completely, so each night, under a pile of blankets, I shivered while cold breezes whipped through the curtains. Though I complained to the hotel staff about this, they couldn't have cared less. Also because my windows would not close, I could hear absolutely everything happening in the street below. Trash trucks at 5am, and drunk, screaming foreigners at 3am. It was miserable. Perhaps you get what you pay for, but I met several people staying in far better hotels in Florence for the same money. Keep looking, and do everything you can to avoid Hotel Medici. You'll be happier for it.

<Content>You get what you pay for I agree with other reviews which state the beautiful view on the 6th floor. It is nice to be able to bring your own bottle of wine and relax in the rooftop garden. They put a lot of attention to the flowers and vines growing all over the terrace (could use some new furniture as much was broken). Many other hotels would have a bar or restaurant on their terrace and would not allow you to bring your own. For my husband and I it was totally worth it (we only paid 95 Euro). You feel like you can reach out and touch the Duomo and get a great view of the rest of the city. The location is ideal as was mentioned.Our room was clean, spacious, and had a wardrobe and desk. What was missing was the television and the phone didn't work. The bathroom was also clean, though not luxurious. Soap does come from a dispenser and toilet tissue more like kleenex. However, if you travel through Italy it is wise to bring your own soap and toilet tissue. Our room was facing the street which seems so quiet during the day. However early morning, the trucks will come through to empty trash and the bells start ringing. By keeping our windows shut, we avoided any noise. No, there is no air conditioning.As other reviewers mentioned, the hotel is prone to student groups. We were there 4 nights and it seemed the hotel was full of teenagers. They were out on the street and on the terrace, happy to be able to buy wine at age 18. They were extremely noisy and rude (yes, they were Americans). I feel sorry for anyone that had to share their floor. It seemed that their behavior was unchecked by hotel staff. Breakfast was normal Italian with no frills. Rolls were definately stale and we never did figure out the juice. Other than servers at breakfast, hotel staff seemed polite. This hotel is what it is....cheap, budget hotel. Not the kind of place where you should expect little shampoos or concierge service. Location far outweighed any inconvenience as far as we were concerned. We found no problem with bed bugs or dirty rooms. So the decision is up to you, but I found no problem considering what we paid for the room.

<Content>Excellent Budget Location After reading some terrible review here about the Medici Hotel, we nearly changed the booking. I'm glad I didn't. This is a budget hotel in an exellent location of Florence, a street or so from the Duomo, the view of which from the hotel's 6th floor roof top terrace is stunning. The terrace is a fantastic place to sit and admire a Tuscan sunset with a bottle of wine and worth the price of the stay!The room we had was clean and basic. Towel and bed linen spotless. The room cleaned and beds made every day. On a negative the staff where some of the unfriendliest I've ever met, do these peole know how to smile? - and the hot water was a bit erratic.Overall, for the money involved this hotel was excellent value for money and I'd go back again.

<Content>Seedy Hotel in a Great Location My college tour group stayed at the Hotel Medici the week before Easter, 2005. Prior to the trip, when I read the numerous negative reviews of the hotel I was sure it could not have been that bad. Sure enough, it is that bad! The only thing going for the Hotel Medici is the location (spittin' distance from the Duomo, in the midst of great shopping and dining, decent walk to the Uffizi). It really is a seedy hotel, shabby, drab, dreary. The bathroom shower stall was shockingly filthy. This is an economy hotel, but I would spend more money and have a clean bathroom next time!

<Content>Noisiest hotel ever !!! My wife and I and two friends (another couple) stayed here for a week in early March 2004. Our friends had to change rooms after the first night to have a decent sized room even though we had made our booking in September 2004. The only good thing about the place is it's location which is bang in the middle of Florence, one street away from the Duomo. The only draw back with this is the bells at least every hour from very early in the morning! However, we got used to it and it did make the stay quite atmospheric. The staff in this hotel make Fawlty Towers look like a five star. I've never come across such a miserable, surly, rude and generally unpleasant bunch, particularly the two dining room staff at breakfast time. The hotel was the only place we came across this attitude from the Italians who otherwise impressed as pleasant, helpful and welcoming, as we had experienced on a previous visit. We were advised when we arrived that there was a student group staying. This turned out to be a party of school children accommodated in rooms throughout our corrider who made a constant racket till all hours in the morning. When raised with reception following a particularly noisy night I was advised that she didn't know what she coud do about it, on which I offered some advice! The school party left in the middle of our stay to be replaced, unfortunately, by a second and noisier bunch of teenagers. Nothing against kids but not till 3am.The rooms are a decent size and bed linen was very clean. We arrived in Florence's coldest March temperatures for 200 years, which did not seem to influence the hotel's policy on turning the one radiator in the bedrooms on at around 6pm and off in the mornings. The en suite shower/ toilet was slightly bigger than a telephone box with badly cracked tiles and a shower head which delivered water in a lukewarm stream (not spray). I could go on but don't want to do my Mr Angry of Glasgow bit. We love Florence, it's a beautiful city and we will go back again. If you sign up to the location, location, location school of thought this place scores highly. If you want accommodation which is any way decent in terms of the fabric of the place or anything which in the slightest way resembles good service LOOK ELSEWHERE.

<Content>Worse than a prison. Stayed in Dec 2001. Looks like from the reviews below that nothing has changed.My girlfriend and I have backpacked around Europe twice. Only staying in 2 stars and below. This has to be the absolute worst hotel in the world. The website makes it out to be a cracker. The rooms was a disgrace. Bed bugs everywhere. Like you'd just slept in an ants nest. The mattresses were terrible. Don't expect a good nights sleep. The bathrooms have just been constructed in the corner of the rooms. When you have a shower everything in the bathroom gets wet and so does some of the carpet outside the bathroom - watch your step because you'll probably end up slipping and falling on your arse.As for the breakfast. A hollow roll and the worst coffee you have ever had in your life. It looked like tar, was viscous like tar and tasteed like tar.The hotel is over 6 or so levels. Reception on level 5. Most rooms are no where near that view you get from up above. The location is the only thing this hotel has got. Do yourself a favour and stay a little bit further away and get a hotel that's not like a soviet prison.

<Content>Don't go there We stayed at the Medici last year and it was the dirtiest place I've ever stayed. The staff were the rudest people I've ever met, and beware as you may find yourself staying in other apartments which don't even have the benefit of the Medici's position. I would never stay there again.

<Content>Aw C'mon, it's not that bad!! I'm glad that I didn't read all of these reviews last year when planning my trip to Florence! We stayed at the Hotel Medici for four nights last April, and despite a number of difficulties mentioned in previous reviews, we would probably stay there again. Why? First, the location was absolutely ideal! We were wallking distance to all of the major sights in Florence. The room was large, the bed linens were very clean, the bed was one of the most comfortable on our month long trip, and the view from the top floor terrace was absolutely fantastic. We took our bottle of wine and cheese up there each evening to look over the Duomo. I will admit that this is NOT a classy place...very far from it! It is bare bones accomodations. It is really scary the first time that you enter and see the seedy looking hallway with the tiny elevator that takes you to the very tired looking reception area. The breakfast was not great, but we always had fresh bread and plenty of coffee. If you are looking for ambiance and luxury of any kind..don't stay here. However, for the price they charged compared to all of the other hotels we checked out, it was worth it!

<Content>Plans include the Medici? CHANGE THEM! I have travelled the world, starting as an undergraduate, camping and youth hosteling. I have never, ever stayed in such a miserable, horrible hotel such as this. This is not a spoiled New Yorker/Londoner speaking, but someone who wants others to avoid the same mistake. Their website is so misleading, I think it dips into the realm of untruth. This is a filthy place without ammenities such as soap, shampoo, water glasses and of course the bigger things like air-conditioning. The bathrooms include a shower which is a head in the wall over a hole in the floor; therefore, taking a shower soaks the entire room and all electrical points are therefore covered in plastic. Shower curtain is tied by wire to hooks in the ceiling. The toilets give off a fragrance of long-flushed urine. Heat comes on once or twice a day if you're lucky. My portable tool set came into immediate use to fix a sink which did not drain, and to replace several broken light bulbs -- they use lurid flouescent ones which cast a ghastly green glow over everything. I bought replacements. Also bought bleach for the toilet and rolls of toilet paper as the dispenser hands out one square at a time. Soap from a public-toilet type dispenser had long since dried up and one sees livid crusts of blue, green and yellow, decays from ancient refills, now discontinued. One member of staff (gender indeterminate) cleans all the rooms (which resemble monk's cells). The room is filthy, bare floors, no chest of drawers or even simple hooks for your coat(s). Two feet of learance round the bed and that's it. The lift is pulled through the center of the winding staircase by a thin cable which passes into the ceiling to heaven knows what machinery -- and there are no emergency breaks -- trust me, my first degree is in engineering! I decide to walk on the bare untreated concrete stairs. All rooms are equally bad as a quick tour confirmed. So if you are unfortunate enough to get stuck here, buy bleach, paper towels, something powerful like oxy-clean, shampoo, soap and your own towels -- the hotel's being napkin material, and sized about double that of a handkercheif. There is no room service at all. There are no coffee/tea bags in the room, only three plastic cups, not renewed. In the land of coffee, their breakfast coffee would rate (my opinion) in the sub-swill category. You cannot park. Totally absent by direct observation are: any helpful staff; A/C; heat; clock/alarm; TV (front panel ripped off, wiring exposed); parking; safe elevator/lift; safe wiring; any decorations or attempt at decor; places to put your clothes -- I could go on and be exhaustive, but you get the idea. Aoid at all costs. Cancel your vacation if necessary for this hotel will spoil the romance of Florence. Horrid, dirty, uncomfortable, cold (or hot) little pension, which anywhere else in the first world might be closed by the authorities. Heaven knows how they get away with it. My stay has cost me hundered of dollars to change plans and get out. I write this for your sake, trust me, don't go there!

<Content>To be avoided Pretty bad experience, not worth the money!Stayed there for 3 nights. The only thing truly nice is the location, from the terrace on the top floor you get a nice view of the duomo.Otherwise, the rooms just looked miserable, old and shabby.Rooms are very tiny, problems with closing the windows and a lot of noise from the street. Also if you fancy having a long sleep in the morning, you might might have to reconsider (the closeness of the duomo has its costs, as i belive the church is still very much active and the toll of the bells quite loud at 7 am).The breakfast is ridiculous, just bread and margarine.Definitely enjoyed better conditions in a youth hostel!!
