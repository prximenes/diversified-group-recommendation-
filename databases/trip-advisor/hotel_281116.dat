<Content>Hidden hotel but next to the action This hotel is way underrated. The staff was amazing and polite, the rooms were big and the bathroom very modern with all sorts pf amenities.The only thng I found interesting was the street. It is a block and a half from Gran Via and Metro, and may not be the best street in the world but always felt safe. Hey it is a big city.I would recommend this hotel anytime and will stay here next time in Madrid.Bonus: breakfast was good !

<Content>Had a great stay at the Siete Islas We had a great stay at the Siete Islas in early October. The rooms are large (by European standards) and are well appointed. The beds were comfortable (but I'm not picky) and the staff was very helpful and courteous. The breakfast buffet was well stocked and catered to a wide variety of tastes. Also remember that the mini-bar in the room is free. The only slight negative about the hotel is the construction going on to the building next door. Nothing really loud or at odd hours but I could see someone getting annoyed if they were a light sleeper and wanted to sleep past ~9:00.

<Content>Sleeping with an open window close to Gran Via Excellent! Very friendly receptionist (female). Asked for a quiet room and got an interior room with no view, but quiet - indeed! Window open all night - no problem! Imagine, only one hundred meters away from Gran Via! Yes, there was air conditioning, but why use energy when you do not need to? - Room spacious and clean, and so was the bathroom. As for the prostitutes etc. - no problem at all. Yes, I noticed a few girls, but they don't bother you if you don't bother them, I guess. Very convenient location both for shopping and culture. Metro station Gran Via close. The famous Telefonica-building is on the corner of calle Valverde/Gran Via, a perfect landmark.Breakfast was more than acceptable, by my standards. (I am a middleaged woman who stayed in a so-called single room, but I had a normal king size bed. Travel quite a lot.) Next time in Madrid, I will stay in Siete Islas, no doubt.

<Content>A great value hotel We were really pleased with our stay here. The hotel was better than some reviews suggest. Some mention a sex shop and 'red light area'. The sex shop is 50 yards away and in our wanderings around the area we saw no others so it is unfair to describe it as such. There is a construction site next door which is noisy in the day time, but that isn't the hotel's fault and we were relocated after our first night (we arrived on a Saturday so no work was taking place) as we realised it would be noisy. Staff were helpful and courteous. The room was clean and spacious. Breakfast was excellent (a very varied buffet choice). The minibar is free, though basic.Our only complaint is that because of travel problems we had to book an extra day prior to our previously arranged booking. Because we were booking an extra day within 72 hours the price hike was huge: from 96 euros per room per day to 175 euros. But that's the way it is. Even allowing for that, averaged out we thought the hotel superb value, and its central location is superb. We walked to the Prado, Thyssen, Reina Sofia, Plaza Major and Royal Palace with ease. We would return and recommend the hotel, but just make sure we had all the nights we needed booked in advance at the lower price.

<Content>Ok I agree in general with the other positive reviews. The location is great. Rooms are clean although quite small. Breakfast good. Minibar free. Free WLAN in the lobby.Only problem, probably ongoing for some time: construction next door on one side. My room faced that side. If you want to have a room that is quiet during the day you should make sure in advance that it does not face the construction site.

<Content>Was an interesting experience.... overall good value!! We booked this hotel through Otel.com. They seem very effiient and also give you extra discounts off following hotels that you book through them.The rooms were extremely comfortable but even though it was situated off the Gran Via, it was pretty noisy. (I am a light sleeper though.)Free minibar would have been very welcome had it been advised at check in. Was also not aware of the free Wi-FI!!! Very good that these services are included in the price, the hotel just needs to advertise them as complimentary!The prostitues made interesting viewing when we came in from a club night out!Incidentally, the hotel is situated close to some great bars, restaurants and shops and also the gay area, La Chueca.One restaurant called the La Pescador on Calle de las infantas was pretty good. It is classedas a Tapas bar and we ordered 5 Tapas.... they came as HUGE plates and despite having huge appetites, we left a lot of food. Great value though lol!!!The breakfast in the hotel was varied and classed as American. One thing the hotel really does need to do is find a way of keeping the hot bacon, eggs and sausage hot as no matter when we went down for breakfast, the hot stuff was not!!!! They also need to get rid of the blonde kitchen assistant!!! She was very rude and reminded me of many staff I had dealings with when I worked in Spain as a rep/manager! All the other staff were absolutely wonderful and could not do enough.... especially on reception.Overall, very recommended! Thanks specially to the reception staff, their knowledge and desire to help was a huge assett to the hotel!!!

<Content>Oki!!!!! This hotel is very well located and staff are very friendly. They give you a free room bar where you have a range of drinks thay refillevery day.The porters are very good as well, they help with luggages or anything you nees.The barman at the coffee bar was really pleasent.The only problem is that the hotel is on a side of the Gran Via highly frequented by prostitutes. They are there all the time and at every corner. Not a nice thing to see in the middle of the city centre of a european country.

<Content>Excellent place to stay This is a lovely hotel in Madrid city center. 2 minutes (literally) from the Gran Via metro station. The booking was made via Otel.com. Stayed there for 8 days. Rooms were well sized and very clean. Bathroom also very spacious and clean. The bathroom had all kinds of personal amenities and kits (sewing, shaving etc). WiFi Internet worked as advertised and was completely free. Breakfast till 10:30 weekdays and 11:00 on weekends, which is great if you are on holidays and thus not an early riser. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Avoid rooms that have limited day light, due to the fact that they are in the back of the hotel. Great place if you want to explore Madrid. All in all, a 4* experience for far less the amount of money requested by similar hotels nearby. Recommended.

<Content>Fantastic We had a brilliant time in Madrid and can't wait to spend longer there, we went for 3 nights and 4 days and loved every minute the weather was very hot. Its a great City and we loved the Sangria and Tapas just what the doctor ordered for a weekend break away from work. The hotel is 4* however our room was a little dark because at the side of the building not much to look over but it was a comfortable room and had toilitries that were ideal.When you eat out Tapas is great, however we found when we went for a drink in the bars they offered tapas either bread or olives one bar gave us pallea, so we didn't need to book a meal because we got fed with tapas every time.There are quite a few sex shops however no one bothers you, so you don't notice it that much, and there is a lot of ladies of the night and same here they don't approach you, only if you want it you go to them so again no bother for us.Great for shopping for bags and shoes 6 euros for a bag and 3 for a pair of sandals.

<Content>Not a 4 star experience This was the most expensive hotel i have stayed in.A double room cost over 170 euro per night on Friday and Saturday,(but under 100 on the other nights.) The hotel is very well located though not in a particularly pleasant street.The room was huge, so large that the tv was too far away to be watched comfortably.There were no English or non Spanish language channels. The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean.Internet access from the room was not possible- only in the lobby. Breakfast was very average and the variety of food was limited and some of it (ham and cheese) not very appetising. The waiter clearing the tables did not put a fresh paper cover over the tablecloth as they do everywhere else but half scraped off the crumbs so basically one had to eat at, what i would consider, a dirty table.The staff were not unpleasant but most of them had a restrained politeness and formality and did not seem very happy at their work. All of the staff at reception were, surprisingly, male.The lobby is large with a coffee bar in one corner.There were Spanish newspapers available but no English language papers.Overall this hotel is fine but it is very overpriced for the comforts on offer and the standards of service.

<Content>Excellent Madrid Centro Location! I really liked this hotel. It was clean, staff were courteous, and the breakfasts were great with some nice traditional Spanish items. They had free internet access in lobby, and the location is excellent. We just took the Metro from the airport and only had to walk across the street and up a block. It's only 1/2 block from Gran Via and near all wonderful shopping spots. Although we bought a 2 day Metro pass, we didn't use it as everything is within walking distance (we're good walkers). I did see working ladies, but no more than I saw around all the tourist centers. I liked that they had restricted smoking areas in the hotel and we were able to get a smoke-free room...although it's hard to totally eradicate the smell if it's allowed on the premises, but they used lots of air freshener in the hallways.

<Content>Great spot, great staff This is a really great hotel. The rooms are very nice and super clean. The staff are extremely friendly, particularly Andres the doorman and Joaquin the waiter. They're very chatty and give lots of good ideas on where to go. The hotel has a great location, it's very central. The girls are a few streets away and don't bother anyone. I would definately recommend staying here, it's great value for money and very comfortable. The mini bar is re-stocked for free every day, but not with alcohol - now wouldn't that be something! Overall, highly recommended.Maria, Dublin. April 2007

<Content>Good value for money. Very central location, Yes a sex shop near by  we did see some ladys of the night ( day! ) But as all adults really no problem to us!. We had rooms on the front, Saturday night a bit noisey, If you are a very light sleeper ask for a back or side room but didnt bother us to much. Staff were very friendly  helpful, on arrival gave us lots of leaflets on what to see  do in Madrid!. Room was spacious clean  big bathroom with a good selection of toiletres.The mini bar was free which was a nice touch, only one beer but good selection of juices ,soft drinks  water, also nuts  a little chocolate!.An easy to use safe  good wardrobe space also made this a very good room.Breakfast was buffet style  a very good choice of hot  cold dishes made this hotel even better value for money.I would use this hotel again if in madrid  if you want a good central base thats clean great value for money  gives you a hearty breakfast then give it a try......

<Content>Really good value Good Points.The hotel itself is very good, its extremely clean, the rooms spacious, the bathrooms lovely, services and staff all excellent, air con not a problem for us. The location is perfect just off of Gran Via within walking distance of most things. The Madrid Vision tour bus stop is close by, or though not a good place to join the bus as not many people get off here and the buses were quite full.Bad points.The situation is not so good, yes there is a sex shop close by but it need not bother you, there are many prostitutes in this area of Gran Via but as 3 couples they did not bother us.The building next door is having massive amounts of work and this starts at 8:30 am but for us again not a problem we wanted to be out and about touring the city not staying in bed.Value for money the Siete Islas could not be faulted we paid 88 euros per night with breakfast, the same hotel in a slightly different area would have been at least an additional 40 鈥?50 euros per night. The good points far out weigh the bad

<Content>massive construction works going on Be aware that massive construction works are daily between 08:00 - 18:00, so no long sleeping in the morning (in a city where everybody stays up until 03:00 in the night/morning) and definitely no nap for siesta!They are tearing down (and will then build up again) several houses next door and back of the hotel; not being a specialist in construction works I assume this loud and dusty works (no chance to open a window!) will continue at least for one if not for 2 more years. This comment maily effects the rooms facing the back of the hotel (= 70% of all rooms the hotel has), but those rooms facing the street are also very noisy because of heavy traffic and lots people filling the narrow street (mainly) night and day.Nevertheless, if this doesn't bother you, I have to admit that this is the ideal hotel for travelers who want to share the nightlife in Chueca, Madrid's most trendy area for youngsters and gays. You also find nearly every other part of touristical interest in walking distance, subway Gran Via is a 2 minutes' walk away.The hotel is very clean, has spacious rooms, large bathrooms with bidet, very friendly and helpfull staff and they offer a good selection of food for breakfast (compared to Spanish standards, of course); excellent value for the money (paid about 100 Euro incl. tax and breakfast for a double room by using bookings.com).Unfortunately they continually facing problems with their air conditioning, we (like many others guests) had to change rooms, before they finally gave us a room where the air con worked. This might not be an issue in early spring or autumn, but in summer with 35 degrees celsius outside temperature you are unable to sleep without air conditioning (we had 28 degrees in the room they gave us first). So if you arrive at the hotel and they take you in a room where the air con is not working, insist on an immediate room change, because the problem can't be solved. They told us that always 8 rooms are connected together and are being served by one airconditioning machine, so don't change to the room next door because there most probably the same problem will occur.

<Content>I used to like it I have been in this hotel many times before and I really liked it. Last time I asked to wake me up at 6,30 A.M. because I needed to go to the airport.They did not ring me and when I went downstairs to complain they just told me that the time was set in the computer and it was my fault because I did not hear the telephone ringing ( which, obviously it is not possible ).In these conditions and with the risk of missing a plane I will never stay here again. They should learn to treat the clients as persons.I did not want them to kill themselves but I would have liked to hear :  sorry, do you want meto ring a Taxi to get to the airport ?  instead of  it is your problem What a pitty.

<Content>Loved it It is one of the best hotel I've ever been. The location is great, on the Gran Via, near Puerta del Sol and subway stop. Well, Calle Valverde is pretty picturesque but safe, instead of what it seems at first view.The rooms are big as weel as the bathroom. No problems with temperature as well as with the staff. The breakfast was fantastic! Whenever I'll come back to Madrid I will stay there, for sure!

<Content>Stayed there by default as well We stayed at this hotel by default as well. The hotel we were booked for originally was over booked and we were escorted to this hotel. My husband and I found the hotel very centrally located (a close walk to Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor). The hotel was very clean as well. I wouldn't call it's location the red light district, there is one sex shop located on the corner, but we never saw girls outside and there are no girls dancing in the windows. I admit I was hesitant to stay there at first, but never felt threatened or unsafe walking back there at night. The staff was not the most helpful but I think it was because thier English was not the best. When we were able to communicate in Spanish (our Spanish is limited) they were at least friendly and tried to accomadate us. Overall we had a very decent time staying at this hotel.

<Content>Hot, Hot, Hot I stayed here and the air conditioning and fan in my room went out. I had a very hard time convincing the people at the front desk that it did not work. Finally, when the maid came up, she said it is very hot in here. They finally fixed it. It stayed fixed for about 6 hours. It went out again. I went down to the desk. They said that no one would be available to fix it for 3 hours. Three hours later there was still no one available. After a terrible night sleep, I demanded a new room. By this time, I was so angry, they knew not to mess with me, and gave me my new room. I had to pack all my clothes and toiletries and move them up 2 floors at 7 o'clock in the morning, with no assistance from the hotel.Guess what? The air conditioning of the new room went out. They made my trip a living hell. I did not know where to go to get relief. I have never written a complaint about a hotel before and I have over 2,000,000 frequent flyer miles, so you know that I have stayed at a lot of hotels.This hotel does not understand the heating and cooling system as installed by the designers. They do not know what they are doing, and do not have people on staff who can fix it.I would run - not walk - the other way. Find somewhere else to stay!

<Content>The red lights of Madrid? We stayed at this hotel really by default, the one we were booked in was over-booked so we were taken by taxi (paid for and accompanyed by the hotel boss) to the Siete Islas Hotel. It was a modern hotel set in a side street just off of the main drag of the Grand Via - very central. The heating was not working in our room, so we were moved to a suite for the same price which was very good after all the moving around, very welcome. We didn't have any meals in the hotel, so cannot comment on that, although have since found out that breakfast was included - so that was a bummer! However the rooms were clean, warm and the bed was HUGE!! Free mini-bar too!! Although only one beer and a selection of soft drinks was not exactly a 'full' bar, it was free so that was a plus. The staff were a bit cool, but we didn't stay there for the sintilalting conversation! The whole place was very new and the room staff very efficient. The only real complaint I would have is that the hotel is bang smack in the middle of Madrid's RED LIGHT district, and is surrounded by sex shops and on every corner (and in every door way) there were 'ladies' offering their services! I did feel sorry for them as it was very very very cold while we were there, and they were out and about day and night!! Needless to say for grown ups it wasn't a problem but if you went there with kids it might be a bit of an eye-opener!
