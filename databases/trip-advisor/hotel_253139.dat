<Content>Disappointed Over the last three years we have stayed at four or five 3 star hotels in Italy and have never been anything less than delighted with any of them. I booked La Gioconda without reading the reviews on Trip Advisor and, when I did get around to reading them I became pretty apprehensive.On the positive side, the owner who was at breakfast each morning, was very pleasant and helpful. The TV, which when we arrived was not working, was soon fixed.The hotel was central and easy to find.There was plenty of hot water.On the negative.......I think the fairest way of summing it up based on our experience, is that if the other hotels where we have stayed, in Rome and Naples were 3 star, then this hotel is at best, 1 star. The room we had was at the top of nearly 80 stairs - there is no lift - and we found it to be gloomy and depressing.It was also very noisy.The TV, once fixed, had no English language channels, which is no big deal but, we have got used to having CNN or SkyNews everywhere we have stayed in the last few years and when so many other things disappointed this seemed like the last straw.Last time I book without reading Trip Advisor first!

<Content>Nice little place We booked this hotel via the Ryan Air website for an overnight stay in Florence during our two week holiday in Tuscany. In my opinion this is a very pleasant and convenient place to stay right in the centre of the city and you are just a stones throw from everything you want to see,The room was small but very clean and tidy, the bedding and sheets were spotless as was the bathroom and the breakfast we had was more than adequate. All in all we enjoyed our stay at La Gioconda and would reccomend it to anyone looking for a budget hotel for a few nights. I am not sure where some people are coming from regarding the rude staff, they were very pleasant and helpful to us and any information we needed were pleased to oblige

<Content>Hotel La Gioconda--convenient, reasonable, clean, family-run If you're looking for accommodations in Florence convenient to the train station and the Duomo, Hotel La Gioconda is a great choice. The hotel is located less than five minutes walk from each on a busy street with other hotels and restaurants. We (one adult with two children in their early 20's) stayed for eight days in late July and early August of 2008. The rates were reasonable (90 Euros) for our 3 person room. The rooms themselves were simply decorated and clean. The bathrooms are en suite, that is in the room, and were fine, though the showers are different than most Americans are used to using. We had a problem with the air conditioning the first night, but we were given a better (and cooler) room the next day for the same rate with apologies. The Hotel is run by a mother and daughter who work hard to make their guests feel welcome and at home. The breakfast room was cheery and had enough of what we liked to keep us happy till lunch. The rest of the staff were very helpful as well. The building is famous for the recovery of the Mona Lisa after the painting (known as La Gioconda) had been stolen from the Louvre almost a hundred years ago. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Location Great - But Not 3 Star Quality Hotel La Gioconda is very well located being some 200m from the train station and 200-300m from the Duomo. However the hotel is not of a 3 star standard. We paid an average of 73 euro a night for a double room and think we were lucky as other rooms were worse. The hotel is a rabbit warren of corridors and rooms and we were placed at the rear of the hotel, so it was quiet. If you were at the front on the main road it would have been awfully noisy. The room was a great size with average furnishings. But did have a large double bed. Hoewever the curtains, bedspread and carpet were very old and worn. The squashed mozzies on the walls also let the room impression down. There was no A/C in the hallways and it was very hot. There was supposed to be A/C in the rooms however these ended up being portable evap units that were ineffective. We asked to be moved however upon seeing another room we realised we probably got one of the best rooms in the hotel.The bathroom was brand new and a pleasant surprise with a great shower and a decent size. It even had a little window that overlooked the roof and roof garden of an adjacent building.The hotel staff were indifferent and breakfast was dreadful. We opted to get our own on the street as it was so poor.We expected more for 3 stars and 73 euro a night.

<Content>Don't Even Go There This dump was classed as a 3* hotel but it was no better than 1* and I'm being kind at that. First impressions were not great - dirty carpeting, no lift and stand-alone air-con that was noisy.The room was very basic and the bathroom though en-suite was cramped.After walking around central Florence and seeing other 3* hotels it was clear to us that this was a hotel well below that standard and so we checked out and moved up the street to another hotel.

<Content>Great Location!!! Me and a friend just returned from a three night stay at La Gioconda and to be honest it was better than i expected especially for the reviews ive seen on here. Check in took literally one minute and we where off to our room, which was surprisingly big for a standard European hotel. The hotel is very easy to find, especially coming from the train station. The hotel is a short walk from anywhere you need to go in Florence, and to top it off there in an internet cafe right around the corner that provides cheep and reliable internet. I very much recommend this hotel for its comfort and its great location. You can鈥檛 go wrong by choosing La Gioconda.

<Content>Very convenient location We booked a last-minute city break to Florence through the BAA website, and this hotel came up as the cheapest bundled hotel deal. Hence we weren't expecting much. However, the hotel is very conveniently located, only five minutes walk from the station, and two minutes from the Duomo.Our room (no. 3) was on the first floor (there is no lift), and overlooked the main road. This meant that there was some traffic noise, but not enough to trouble us thanks to the various layers of windows and shutters. We had air conditioning, a safe in the wardrobe, and twin beds pushed into a double (common for similar European hotels). The furniture and bathroom were basic, but very clean.Breakfast was a basic European buffet (cereal, croissants, bread, cheese/cold meat, preserves, fruit juice), with good coffee. The staff were friendly and helpful.In summary, this hotel gave us just what we needed as a base to visit Florence from. It was very good value, but don't expect the earth if you're not paying for it!

<Content>What do you expect Just got back from a 3 night stay. we were concerned about the advance/adverse reviews we read but overall we were happy with our stay. Bearing in mind that all we needed was somewhere to sleep and shower/change clothes before going out to dinner it was fine. After all, in Florence how much time do you want to spend in a hotel. Room was small but clean and all we needed.The staff were fine, we booked an early call one morning and the guy even phoned us again 30 mins after the call to make sure we were awake.Breakfast was nothing to write home about, adequate, but is standard for this type of hotel in Europe. If you want more try any of the local cafes nearby for a few Euros.One word of caution is to be prepared for the climb up the stairs, they're narrow and steep, so be aware.Finally, more than anything the hotel is in a fantastic location, 10 mins walk from station and 5 mins from Duomo, couldn't be better.

<Content>hated it Our experience was horrible - our reservation was for a triple room and a double room - when we got there we were told our rooms were on the third floor - NO ELEVATOR - NO HELP - we went up approximately 100 steps - by the time we got to the third floor we were out of breath - when we opend the door to our rooms we were completely upset - it was a single room, no air, no working tv, no working phone, no soap, no towels and it smelled terrible - I had to go down 100 steps again since the phone was not working and let them know this was not the rooms we ordered. we were told it was sold out and the next day we would get a better room - that night was horrible - the bed was small enough for one person - and not three people. When we changed the rooms the next day - the only ok think was that it was on the 2nd floor - we did not have to go up over 100 steps again. The rooms were very small and again nothing working. they say this is a 3 star hotel - believe me to give them a 0 star is a compliment - if you like to stay near il Duomo sleeping outdoors is more comfortable than sleeping in that awful place - one more thing its infested of moskitos. When we went a few doors down to a beautiful hotel to find out what pricing were their rooms they told the same as La Gioconda - SHAME SHAME ON YOU OWNER OF LA GIOCONDA - FOR STEELING MONEY FROM TOURISTS -

<Content>Excellent location, average hotel The hotel was extremely convenient - just down the road from the station (Firenze SMN) and close to the Duomo. We didn't stay at the hotel the first night because there was apparent plumbing problems. We stayed at the Hotel Telle a few buildings down (which had the smallest lift I've ever been in) instead.We stayed in the hotel Gioconda for 5 nights. We were given a twin bed room even though I had specified a double room. They said it was because that room was quieter than the other rooms.The room was functional and the bathroom was clean. The room was indeed quiet - no traffic noise at all but did not look as nice as the photos on the website. Not quite a prison cell but it could have had a few paintings or flowers to brighten it up a bit.The service was good and the staff were friendly. The breakfast room was bright and served the usual cereal and sweet croissants. There are no lifts which isn't usually a problem for me but on the penultimate night I had sprained my ankle so walking up four flights of stairs was suddenly not so easy.

<Content>Not a 3-star This hotel was the worst place we stayed in during out trip to Italy. I will say that the location was great. But for the price and the three star rating, this hotel was a huge dissapointment. The rooms really need to updated. The carpets are old and the lighting is terrible. We had a lightbulb that had burned out, we requested it be replaced or they provided us with a new bulb two times, it never happened. I would NEVER stay here again, there are much better places to stay.

<Content>Other reviews a little harsh I think The hotel is OK but certainly nothing special. Rooms are clean enough but they are dark and can be a little cold at night in winter. Florence is an amazing place so if you just need somewhere to sleep then this is a great, reasonably priced place as the location is simply superb. Especially if you are arriving by train. Ask for a room on a lower floor as it is a long hike with bags to the top floor (no elevator). Oh, and the breakfast is a joke!

<Content>Do Not Stay Here! I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. I spent 6 weeks in Europe this summer and this hotel was by far the biggest disappointment. The only thing that this hotel has going for it is the location.The room is extremely minimal and not up to par. I would under no circumstances rate this a 3 star hotel- I agree with other reviews that it is more like a hostel. I wish I knew before I made my reservation. The mattress was absolutelty horrible 鈥?springs creeked every time you moved and there was a huge dip in the middle of the bed 鈥?the mattress is probably older than I am! I literally had to request additional pillows to run lengthwise on the mattress to make it firmer so that I could sleep. The bathroom is very small and the water leaks out into the room. Also, the maids did not clean our room 2 out of the 3 days that we were there and we were not given clean towels. In addition, the one day that they did come they turned off our airconditioner 鈥?and it was over 90F! I paid way too much for the crappy room and then they had the audacity to turn off my airconditioning! Also, beware of the stairs 鈥?there is no elevator. We were of course on the top floor and got to haul our bag up close to 90 stairs!The staff is very rude 鈥?we asked the concierge to look into tickets for the Galleria Dell鈥橝ccadeimia to see the David 鈥?and he didn鈥檛 bother to do it so we didn鈥檛 get to go. I guess he is just paid to sit on his butt all day and be rude to customers. Lastly, the 鈥渂reakfast鈥?is a complete joke. You get a corssiant, a packaged biscuit, and some NASTY red juice 鈥?I have no idea what it was. We oke up early to go to breakfast and were very upset to see what we got 鈥?we only went once!Overall, this a HORRIBLE HOTEL and I would not recommend it to anyone. You are paying way too much for what you get 鈥?look elsewhere.HOPE THIS HELPS EVERYONE! HAVE FUN IN FLORENCE - MINUS THE HOTEL, I LOVED IT!

<Content>Very disappointing hotel Good points: great location, so handy for main part of Florence, all the attractions and restaurants. Staff on the night shift were very friendly, eager to please and liked to chat.Bad points: room not dissimilar to a prison cell. Tiny, unrecognisable from any photos we have seen on the website. It was in the back of the hotel and was barely big enough for two people. The hallway and all the corridors smell of musty food or something equally distasteful. We were on the top floor (five flights of winding stairs) and with no lift, I do not know how most people get their cases up the stairs. I am a sportsman and over 6 foot 3, so managed... barely!!! General tip: if you are here for a short time, this hotel will suffice, but for a special occasion, do not bother, you will be disappointed. Not really reflective of the price - more like a no frills experience.

<Content>Very good hotel Having read a few of these reviews after I booked Hotel La Gioconda I was quite worried, since some of them were very negative. After staying there myself I only have positive things to say about the hotel. It was clean and comfortable - obviously not luxurious, but very good value for the price. The hotel staff were always friendly and helped us by printing out train times for our trip back to Pisa airport. The complimentary breakfast was basic, but fine. The location of the hotel was perfect, a couple of minutes walk from the Duomo, and very close to lots of wonderful bars, cafes and restaurants as well as the city centre.This hotel is excellent value for money, especially for a short stay (we stayed four days). If you're looking for luxury, don't book this hotel, but if you're travelling on a budget and want somewhere clean and comfortable in a good location, I would definatley recommend it.If you can, get a room overlooking the back yard. We had one and it was very quiet. The front of the hotel overlooks a busy road, and I imagine those rooms would be noisier. Also, if you have trouble with stairs, be warned that there are a lot to climb. Apart from that, there are no probs at all with the hotel - don't listen to the people leaving negative reviews!

<Content>Perfectly OK 12 October 2007True the stairs can be a bit tricky after the odd bottle or two of Chianti but don't believe the doom mongers. This hotel is perfectly placed for the railway/bus station and all the major attractions.You get what you pay for in this world and if you want big plush rooms go somewhere else pay a fortune and leave the La Gioconda to people like me who appreaciate a good deal.I couldn't fault the staff in any area of the hotel.Having said all that a shower curtain would be a good idea.

<Content>Horrible hotel, Recommend it to all your enemies Well, we stayed at this hotel a couple of years ago... it seems, by the pictures in their website, that the rooms have been renovated maybe鈥?even tough I remember that we chose this hotel because it looked lovely in the web pictures...and we didn't know trip advisor by then). In any case, we'll never forget this hotel, because this is the worst hotel we've visited ever. Really. If with this words I'll save one soul, it will be enough. Now seriously. The crew was EXTREMELY rude... The hotel and the room were so dirty, that I pass taking a shower there鈥?we stayed for the night, because we had no choice and we cancelled the rest of our reservation. Believe me that even its good location doesn't worth it.I know the hotels rates in Florencia are very high鈥?but still, please stay away from this hotel.P.S.: if you have a low butget and a car, maybe you should consider staying outside Florencia, at Fusile, maybe. Good location but horrible hotel. Dirty, staff extremely rude. We stayed for one night and we left....

<Content>Great Location - not a bad hotel, but definately not 3 star quality! My Boyfriend and I stayed here on Tuesday 17th July, for one night only. Finding the hotel was very straightforward as it's only a stonesthrow away from Santa Maria Novella train station and is extremely central to all of the attractions in Florence. On booking, I had paid 9 Euro's to be upgraded and receive a 'Welcome Gift'. Expecting this to be maybe a bottle of wine, fruit etc - we were most amused when we were given a tiny 'silver' keyring in the shape of a toy car! Although this caused us a great deal of amusement , save yourself 9 Euro's, don't bother with the upgrade!Although the room was very clean and tidy, it more resembled a hostel than a 3* Hotel. Extremely minimal, very dark - with a window view of the back of an old building. We could not close the window either, as the pipe going from the huge and extremely noisy air conditioning unit in our room was hanging out through the window. Obviously this caused some concern regarding security and leaving our passports in the room etc. Also, as mentioned, the air conditioning unit was deafening! The bathroom was a TINY room off the bedroom with extremely shabby and dated furniture  tiles and with only a curtain separating the shower from the rest of the bathroom, the water was flowing out onto the bathroom floor and eventually out into the room! I also wouldn't recommend it to anyone over 57 as the door is extremely small! My boyfriend took a few knocks to the head! As for the breakfast - An extremely miserable waitress, a stale croissant, extremely sickly red fruit juice and a packet of french toast. Not the best!However, as I stated earlier, the hotel is in an excellent location and if, like us you simply want to do a quick sightseeing trip, this place is ideal for a maximum of 2 nights.

<Content>Wonderful hotel centrally located, great service. Beverly Hills traveler. This is a great hotel which is very affordable. It is centrally located, and is one block away from the Major Duomo. Many other sitesare very close to this hotel. The rooms are clean and bright, the bathroom is modern and has a full sized bathtub. All the people who work here are very friendly and helpful.I would definitely stay here again. I had a great experience here. In addition to the hotel accomodations, La Gioconda also boasts some very special history. The famour Mona Lisa painting which was stolen from the Louvre Museum in the late 1800s was discovered in this hoteland returned to the Louvre in 1913.I will be making my reservations to stay here again very soon.Signed Steve from Beverly Hills, California USA.

<Content>Subpar Hotel, Rude Staff, Damaged Car We stayed in Hotel Gioconda for three days. During that time, the staff was rude and unhelpful, the room was not up to par, and the amenities we had been promised were not delivered. When we asked for directions to locations in Florence, we were given factually incorrect information by the hotel staff. There was no in-room safe, and the hotel made us turn in our keys at the front desk when we left each morning. Adding to the concern, when we came back early, other staff had inexplicably taken our room key so it was no longer at the desk and we had to search them down to get into our room. Fortunately, nothing was stolen, but it was very unsettling.To top it all off, when we got our car back from their garage it had a flat tire (that it did not have when we dropped it off). The front desk staff were reluctant to let us use the house phone to call the rental agency because it was in Rome, but finally relented. They people in the garage had changed the tire to the donut, but there was no sort of apology or attempt to fix the probelm, and they did not tell us until we were checked out, so we had to get it fixed as we were heading to our next location - we were fortunate in that we were not leaving Italy that day, because it would have delayed us by several hours.Do not stay in this hotel.

<Content>Moldy rooms w/ rude obnoxious owner managing Moldy smelly room, rude obnoxious owner. Mold was all over the ceiling  wall. We prepaid  they would not credit us. The owner was obnoxious with so much in your face attitude. When we complained the owner threatened to call the police  have us arrested. They must be friends of the hotels.com inspector to call that a 3 star hotel. I would say barely a1 star, nah no stars for La Gioconda. Hotels.com promised us a credit on future bookings, but never came thru. We were so happy that we moved after the first night to a wonderful clean newer hotel just a couple of doors down for the same price.

<Content>Positive Experience We stayed here in May and found the hotel clean and comfortable with friendly staff.Our room was spacious and airy, well decorated in a simple tasteful style with a well appointed bathroom.Shutters and double glazing kept the noise to a minimum, with air conditioning provided to make the room comfortable in hot weather, but expect a little traffic noise , this is the centre of a busy city.The location was a mere 10 minutes from the Duomo and and the station making it an ideal place to stay whilst doing the sites in Florence.Expect a well served simple continental breakfast to start the day.There is no lift at the hotel however neither is there one at the cupola or the canpanile. This may be a consideration for the less agile.Ideal simple accommodation for those who like to be out and about.

<Content>recommended to stay Very nice hotel, where we found courtesy and attention in the personnel when we required information and additional services. We found clean room and quite. Also the position in the center of Florence was very useful to rapidly walk around and visit the monuments. When available ask for the room were it was discovered the La Gioconda picture stolen from Paris's Louvre (that's why the name of the hotel). I feel that also the price was particularly convenient. I walk a lot around the world and I am surprised to read that few other client (I read their messages) had so wrong experience.

<Content>NEVER AGAIN..... 11 ladies away in Florence for a weekend for my 30th birthday....the holiday was ruined because of the hotel. They split us up, 2 of us having to go to another hotel down the road because the rooms weren't painted and had no beds (the flip side - at least 2 escaped!) No lift and a strong smell of paint and sewage resulted in my sister having an asthma attack, which they did nothing to ease or help. For the 9 that stayed there, the night was noisy, uncomfortable and distressing. No staff to be seen anywhere in the night. Breakfast was very basic, we gave up and went to a local coffee shop. DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR BOOK ELSEWHERE!!!

<Content>Not a god expirience !!! We鈥檝e stayed 1 night at Hotel La Gioconda and it was a terrible experience. The room was cold because the window didn鈥檛 close completely. Also we had to climb about 50 steps to get to our room with our entire luggage. The worth was having my wallet robbed from my room. I couldn鈥檛 prove it, but I鈥檓 quite sure that it was taken there.

<Content>Beautiful city, awful hotel! Stayed 1 night at Hotel La Gioconda, it was awful. The room felt dirty, damp  we had to climb about 100 steps to get to our room. I would class it a 1-2 star hotel  would definitely not go back. The only good thing about this hotel was it location. It was a 5 minute walk from the train station  very close to the main attractions. Florence made up for the accomodation  I would definitely return to this beautiful, romantic  cultured city. You need at least 4 days to explore the city, however it is very expensive.

<Content>Awful Firstly i this is the worst hotel we have have stayed in Italy. There is no lift and the disjointed layout meant we had to carry our cases 87 steps to our room. The hotel doorman was grumpy and made no attempt to help us with the cases. We arrived in the room which was tiny, had grotty furniture but was clean. The bathroom was tiny but was clean but noisy with a leaking toilet and noisy fan. Having checked into the hotel for 2 nights and paid 85 euros online, we left the following morning and went to the Fenice Palace for 100 Eur a night, which was in comparison a palace. I got the impression this was a bucket shop internet hotel, all bookings were online from expedia, last minute etc. The reason for this is that people entering off the street would NEVER stay in this hotel. The breakfast consisted of 1 croisaant, packet toast and coffee. Terrible, please avoid this hotel.

<Content>A bit noisy! We were there for 3 nights. We had a room at the front, our friends a room at the back. Despite the external windows shutters, a traditional window, a double glazed window and internal shutters (yes 4 different types of shutters on the same window-frame) we found the room very noisy especially from about 6.30 in the morning. Air conditioning is provided by a stand-alone unit in the room. We did not use it.Our friends who were at the back had a quieter room but on the Monday morning were woken up at about 5.30 by some motor noises which lasted over 1/2 hour, from what they believed to be a sewage collector or similar.The rooms were basic. No luxury. We had a noisy toilet flush.Breakfast was very meager, hot drinks, bread and jam.On the other hand, very nice people at reception (they unexpectedly prepared breakfast for us one hour before the normal time on our last day), and the location is very convenient.

<Content>Cheap  Sometimes reading these reviews I wonder what planet some of these people are on! This is a low priced hotel, so I don't know what people expect! OK, it's a bit basic... but on the whole, absolutely fine. This hotel is handy for the train station and all the nearby attractions (by the way I have never queued so much as in Florence - they love it!!! Tip: Book all in advance). The front desk were helpful and the room we had was a fair size, no lift though, but again... hardly a big deal! Breakfast very basic and you had to pay extra for luxury items such as corn flakes! THe most amazing thing about this hotel was the size of the bathroom sink... WOW! Oh and we got a free bottle of red wine too, which can't be bad! For the price, great!

<Content>money could be spent better Not a horrible hotel, but definately not one of the best. Not far from the train station (maybe 1/4 of a mile), between the station and El Duomo. Our room was streetside on the top floor (only stairs up to the 4th floor), which was ok as we did not carry too much luggage. The A.C. worked well. The room itself was very basic. Surprisingly, no noise from the main street below, but there were two sets of windows, plus the shutters. The staff were fine, nothing spectacular, much like the hotel.

<Content>very very terrible HelloWe travel a lot., bu this was a terrible expiriense in our traveling life. this hotel can not be 3 stars hotel. we can give only 1 star and it will be as s peresent for them.First for all. there is no lift and if you have a heavy luggage you should be a supermen to bring them upstairs. A Room that we got was as 1 star hotels room. very old furniture , small toilet. night time you can not sleep because is very noisy until 4 AM, and at 7 AM noise continue. Breakfast. 陌t was ridiculous. 1piece old bread and small butter and small jam and that all. cup of coffe or tee.陌 hope that you agree that is not a breakfast.(The owner of this place is lady from France maybe for them a breakfast should be like this)We booked for 2 nigths, but after first night we decieded to leave this nightmare. but a French lady told as that our credit will be charged anyway for two nights.So 陌 would not reccomend to nobody this hote. 陌 am sure that for this money you wii find v good hote, 陌 mean better ( we paid 150 euro per night)

<Content>worst experience in any hotel Having booked to stay 4 nights at La Gioconda we left after the first. The room was tiny, bore no resemblence to the photographs, and which offered window views of a blank wall and the trash cans in the alleyway below. After complaining, we were told that the hotel was fully booked, though as soon as we let it be known that we had secured accommodation at another hotel a vacant room mysteriously appeared but was worse than the first, as there was a distinctly bad odour that permeated the room. The reaction of the staff was to raise their voices at us in front of other guests without listening to anything we were saying. I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy and wonder how it managed to be rated more than one star?

<Content>March 2006 Comments Despite terrible reviews, we booked and have just spent 4 nights at the Hotel. It was perfectly ok and has just had a complete refurbishment. The room and bathroom were fine .. perhaps a criticism is the noise from street traffic - we were room 21 ( top floor at the front ) .. the windows possibly could function more efficiently in keeping out noise since there are 2 shutters, plus asingle pane window, and a double glazing window .. due to the air conditioning pipe the windows do not close tightly .. we reported this to the hotel. The staff were execellent and friendly as also was the breakfast staff.If you are worried about noise, book for a room at the rear. Lugging cases up the spiral staircase is hard work - there is no lift.

<Content>Great little hotel After reading trip advisor results i was a bit weary of this place after booking but when we got there i couldn't help but be pleasantly surprised. The reception staff were really friendly and helpful. While there is a winding staircase we were informed of this beforehand so it wasn't a problem. The hotel itself was very clean. Our room was large in size and while the bathroom was a bit small it had everything you would need. Maid service everyday so after coming home from the sights of beautiful florence the room was spotless clean. The location of this place is fantastic all the main sights of florence are no more than a 15 minute walk away. Breakfast is your basic continental, I would definitly recommend this place for a short break we stayed in it for 5 days. Its 24 hour reception is also a plus! We had no complaints about it.

<Content>"Mona Lisa, Mona lisa, men have named you" Alright its a bit run down but we stayed in the very room that the Mona Lisa was stashed in after it was nicked from the Louvre. There was a brass plaque on the door. We loved it. You walk out of the front door turn left and about 100 meters away is the Duomo. You cannot get any more central. Staff were nice. Breakfast ok. What you are getting here is location not luxury. Lets face it how much time do you spend in your hotel room when in Florence. My wife and I gave it good marks purely for being involved in a small part of history.
