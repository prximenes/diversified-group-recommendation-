<Content>Okay if you smoke, have no luggage, no car, and don't watch TV This is the third place I have stayed in in the same building at 56 via Faenza since 1974. Also probably the first time I've stayed in a hotel room without a television, which I must admit I really missed. The furniture in the double (shown in numerous photos) is very nice - a nice firm bed, and the bathroom is very high quality for a one-star hotel. The entire place reeks of cigarette smoke, although smoking is prohibited. The smell drove me crazy. We stayed here because Frommer recommended it and it was near my son's apartment. I would have preferred to pay a bit more to stay at a three-star hotel. We paid 140 euros for two nights (total) plus another 46 euros to garage our car. I didn't think the long climb to get up 4 flights would be so arduous but I must admit it was a bit of a drag. All-in-all, not a good value, and I would certainly not stay here again. Frommer's really needs to review their research every 20 years or so.

<Content>Nice Stay My friend and I stayed here for 2 nights in October 2008. The hotel is close to the train station and can be easily reached by walking along via nationale and then turning left onto via faenza. The hotel is on the right hand side of the street. The only thing I disliked about the hotel is having to climb to the top of the building with your luggage, which was tiring. You ring the door bell and then the owners open the door for you. Since we arrived early and our room was not ready yet, we were able to store our luggage in a room while we started to explore the city.The room was spacious and extremely clean. There was no tv. The male owner was very gracious. He recommended some good traditional Italian restuarants to try on via guelfa. The staff were friendly and would greet you as you head in or out of the hotel.The hotel is within walking distance of all major attractions and there is a very cheap internet/phone place across the street. Overall, this is a good budget option and I enjoyed my stay here.

<Content>Pleasant stay My husband and I stayed for 4 nights at the Hotel Merlini in mid October. The hotel is walking distance to the train station (5 min) and amenities such as grocery store and self service launderette (2min for both).They are located in the 3rd floor of a building that has no elevators. The hotel owners are very courteous and helpful but speak very little English.The room we had was very spacious and basic with a bed, side tables , a desk and a wardrobe. There is no TV or Breakfast. The room also came with a private bathroom with stand-only shower. We had a fresh supply of towels and a good working hair dryer. We also had free access to the internet on request.Overall, the place was clean and comfortable. The room we had was a little noisy at night only when guests at the nearby hostel were on the mood for a party.For the 66.25 euros we paid per night, I think we had all that we needed and were pleased with our accommodations.

<Content>Okay on a budget Four of us traveled throughout Italy for 2 1/2 weeks. Stayed here when we went to Florence. It was alright. In a safe neighborhood and convenient location. The room was clean. We had a room with a balcony, but when we walked out onto it, it felt like it was leaning forward and did not feel very secorely fastened to the building. Also, when we pulled the shower curtain closed the bidet was in the shower with us! Yuk! The owner's were very nice, but spoke very limited English. We studied Italian for three months before we left and still had a little trouble communicating. It was not a bad place to stay as the price made it very affordable and it did feel clean and safe. No TV in room, or phone, no perks, but okay place to stay.

<Content>Fabulous and peaceful! This hotel was wonderful, the owner and the staff were so great, and always willing to help. The room was spacious and very very clean, the bathroom was also spacious ( including the shower). Its was quiet at night, you couldn't hear any neighbours at all. It was just peaceful and that's exactly what you want when you've just spent the whole day sightseeing. The location is very convenient and close to the train station, about 5 min. walk. Overall, it was great and I would recommend it to anyone, even honeymooners. For the price(70euro/night room with bathroom) it was totally worth it, can't complain at all.Thank you Hotel Merlini we had a great stay,cant wait to come again!

<Content>family run hotel near the main train station I stayed in the hotel for 2 nights. This is the only 1 star hotel i stayed in through out my 2 weeks in italy (which i stayed in 3 stars hotel). I did not notice that it is a one star hotel when i made the booking. At first i was scared when i was climbing up the stairs to this hotel (hotel on 3rd floor) and did not know what to expect. As I arrived I found out the hotel was run by a family. The host was nice and accomodating and made me feel like staying at a home! I know nothing about how stars were given to italian hotels- but I am satisfied with the facilities the hotel offers. My room has a private bathroom- the bath room was clean and seems to be recently renovated, the shower was nice, there was a hair-dryer and towels were provided. There was no shampoo/shower gel etc. The beds were big and comfortable and there was an extra pillow and blanket. The room was quiet, clean and spacious. the cupboards can be locked. Breakfast was not included in my booking so I had breakfast in nearby cafes.This hotel is very close to the train station if you know the right way, and the duomo is within a walking distance of 10-15 minutes.The hotel also has a collection of travel guide books about florence and italy which i found useful.I am satisfied with the price of the hotel (compared to other hotels in florence) and I would recommend this hotel for those who are travelling to florence!

<Content>Liitle gem My husband and I stayed here for a couple of nights and were really pleased with our choice (thanks to the Trip Advisor reviews from previous guests!). It is in a great location - you can walk to all the major sights, attractions, bars and restaurants from here. The neighbourhood was relaxed and it felt safe walking back to the Albergo late in the evening. The owners of the place were really helpful and were very patient with my poor italian! The room was great - very clean, simple and there was a great view from the window. The air con worked really well and the bathroom was modern and spotless. Just a couple of down sides:1. If you're a car driver, you can't park outside the Albergo. The owners do arrange for a company to collect your car, keep it in secured storage and then return it when you're leaving which is handy but adds to the cost of your stay by 20 euro per night. 2.The owner seems to chain smoke so the communal corridor did smell of stale smoke. The room, however, didn't.Saying this, I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Lacking ambiance The Hotel is in an excellent location in terms of being very close to all the facilities/railway station, etc. and the room was spotlessly clean, with a comfortable bed and adequate shower room. We spent three nights here and found the place adequate in all respects. The owners were pleasant enough, but spoke little English.I felt just a little disappointed by the ambiance of the place, there isn;t any! We overlooked a courtyard owned by a Hostel opposite to the Hotel, and it looked very pleasant, grassy with tables and chairs outside......but, we were on the third floor with no balcony, just a window - and there really was nowhere to sit with a glass of wine, or cup of coffee, etc. I appreciate that you are out and about most of the time, but, it is nice to have somewhere to just sit and relax at the end of the day, and that was missing here.Apart from this, the Hotel is fine in all respects.

<Content>Decent budget family-owned albergo I stayed in a room with a private bathroom.Pros: conveniently placed near the train station and the city center. It is a decent family-owned albergo for a budget stay. Very clean, and very friendly staff.Cons: it is placed in the 3rd floor (no lift).

<Content>Amazing Stay Hotel Merlini was brilliant. Location was brilliant, just 7 minutes walk to the Duomo and a few more to everywhere else. It was also very close to the train station, literally 5 minutes walk. The bedrooms and bathrooms were amazingly clean and also spacious, with a great view from the window. We're really glad we found this charming place, and happy that we met the lovely owners! Would recommend for anyone on any type of trip to florence.

<Content>Small hotel in a great location The Merlini was a great choice for Florence. It is within walking distance from the train station on a small, quiet side street. The staff (family) were very kind and spoke English. It is up 4 flight of stairs, but the Signora had her husband help us with our luggage; he refused to take a tip then and also when we left. We had a fairly large room with a high ceiling and air conditioning (you need this in Florence in the summer). The large window looked out to the tops of the Basilica di San Lorenzo and the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore--a beautiful view. The bathroom was a good size and the bed very comfortable. We walked to all of our sight seeing experiences in Florence from this hotel. When I made the hotel reservation by e-mail, I asked them to make our reservation for the Uffizi and the Accademia. They gladly did this, and e-mailed the reservation codes to me before we left for Italy. We paid 90 euros per night. I would return to this hotel when we go back to Florence.

<Content>Loved our stay Cleanest place we stayed while in Italy. Stayed in two different rooms (over different time periods) and both were spotless. Nice and close to the train station and within walking distance to all the attractions. It was actually nice to get value for our money for once. It is up a few flights of stairs but well worth the walk. Staff are friendly and accomodating. Room key is HUGE so leave it with the staff while you're seeing the sites. Would definitely recommend this Hotel if you're looking for a clean, less expensive, well run place to sleep and relax.

<Content>Merlini best budget hotel of our trip My grand daughter and I stayed at this albergo during our trip to Italy, one of four budget hotels we stayed in. It was by far the best bargain, the most quality for the money paid (excellent for its category). Our room was spotless and, while simple, attractive with a large and newly tiled bathroom. The owner and his family were warm and we felt safe and watched over.We were traveling carry-on only so its location near the train station was helpful. Of course we had to climb stairs with our luggage but this was generally true for budget hotels. We enjoyed the neighborhood which was full of restaurants and liveliness. As soon as we arrived, the owner of the restaurant on the corner sent us to his mother's place for a quiet lunch.The location was great and we could easily walk to the Ufizzi and other tourist sites. I am a seventy five year old retired university professor who has traveled all over the world and I'll remember this lodging with a special place in my heart.

<Content>Sweet Albergo in Florence I agree with all the positive that has been written about Albergo Merlini on this site. This is a special, quiet albergo in an ideal location in this city. My lovely room had a view of the duomo at San Lorenzo and was immaculate. In addition, the furnishings are beautiful and contribute to Merlini's sweet and comfortable character. In a city that seems tired by its tourists, Rosario and his family really make you feel at home. They are warm and helpful and willing to engage with smiles. You cannot beat the price, the quality, the location, and the crisp white sheets on the most comfortable bed.

<Content>Home in Florence I'm a big fan of the Merlini. It's two blocks from the train station and bus lines, two blocks from the mercato centrale and the good shopping, and near other important Florence attractions such as the Duomo. Being so close to the tourist sites, you might not expect to find a quiet, family-run, charming albergo with cool marble hallways, terrazzo tile in the bedrooms, updated restrooms and rooms with air conditioning and private baths...and a view of Duomo from the balcony room. But, there it is! The Merlini is like your home in Florence.Signore Rosario and his wife keep the hotel clean, safe, relaxed, and if he happens to be snipping the basil he grows on the balcony...chances are you will soon smell the scents of a home-cooked meal wafting down the halls. Lovely people, lovely place, good value. This is REALLY Italian!

<Content>Charming hotel in great location I highly recommend this hotel. I stayed here with a group of 5 college students and 2 parents. We all thought it was It was absolutely charming, safe, and in a great location for walking to many of the sites in Florence. The rooms were very clean and comfortable with air conditioning and hair dryers and I highly recommend the breakfast s, served in a room with a windows opening out on a splendid view of the city. The family members who own and manage this hotel are very helpful and friendly and are present in the hotel at all times. We though it was very reasonably priced, given the location, the friendly service, and the warm ambience.

<Content>Noisy, unsafe feeling, yet clean I stayed here based on a review from Frommers. How it made their list I do not know. The neighborhood felt creepy. The walk up the stairs to the hotel was grueling, especially after a day of walking. We didnéˆ¥æª› feel completely safe in the hotel either. Keys were left hanging in the hall. While the owners did look out each time someone entered it still felt precarious. Frommers commented about how this place had window screens, but it was so loud outside one couldnéˆ¥æª› open the windows anyway. Also, each night the owner spoke loudly with another man and it echoed down the hall into the rooms. There wasnéˆ¥æª› much charm to our room. We paid 75 euros a night, but would have paid more for a better hotel. I must say the place was clean.

<Content>Decent place on a budget A decent place on a budget, Merlini was a reasonable walk from most of the sights. It's in an area full of budget lodgings, so there are lots of American students around. It's a hike up the stairs with heavy baggage, and during our stay (in early June) it got so hot we couldn't sleep very well. But the staff was friendly and helpful, and it was clean and well-maintained for the price.
