<Content>Average hotel We stayed for 5 nights between Christmas and the new year in a two roomed suite. Over all I found the hotel clean and the staff friendly. However the decor is tired and the restaurant food is horrible. We had specifically wanted an apartment room with a kitchen to be able to cook some small meals, however on arrival we we informed by a print out on the cooker that the gas supply to all rooms had been terminated! This was very fustrating as we could have spent the same amount of money staying in a more luxurious hotel without cooking facilities! However the hotel has an excellent location and we did enjoy the stay.

<Content>I think you could find nicer. I stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment on the 27th floor of the Hotel, which provided a great view of the city. The apartment was very spacious but the decor is a tad dated, and we were disappointed to find that the cooker in the kitchenette didn't work. On arrival we were given $250 of vouchers to eat in the hotels restaurant, which seemed great, until we did and found out that you can only use $10 a head and the food in the restaurant is expensive and served lukewarm. So this is a bit of a gimmick and merely a way of getting you to spend more money in the hotel. The location was good and the door staff were very helpful and friendly. Overall It's not the worst hotel, however for the price I think you could find nicer.

<Content>Average Stay The pluses: Great elevators, nice high floor suites, prompt housekeeping, good balcony, great iron and ironing board, good TVs. Nice little kitchen with great refrigerator and dishwasher. Excellent shower pressure. Very comfortable beds with great pillows and comforters. The minuses: Less than engaging front desk staff, raw edges to closet doors and other details, dirty hinges in bathroom cabinets, funky little coffee maker with no funky little filters. Had to traipse all over to find a fit. No DVD or CD player.We stayed for two weeks over Christmas. We usually stay in an Upper West or East Side area to escape the crowds, but no availabililty this year. That said, we picked the Kimberly and overall it was a good midtown hotel. Not the best, but certainly a far cry from the worst.Note that rates are higher than the value but if you are staying for a few days the location is great.

<Content>Amazing time with my grown-up kids I just wanted to say what a wonderful time I had with my three grown-up children (no partners) celebrating my 60th Birthday in New York. I had booked the hotel directly by telephone in March and sent them an email 6 days before to make sure that everything was OK. Having spoken to the hotel originally I had booked a double suite with sitting room, a view, a balcony (although I did think it would be superfluous seeing as it was December, but actually we did use it and have a number of pictures of us with the Chrysler Building in the background) - I have to write a review because it was because of Trip Advisor that I ended up booking this hotel - I looked at hundreds. Our room was on the 26th floor and the beds were the MOST comfortable beds I have every enjoyed in an hotel, which is saying something!! The rooms are not enormous and the bathrooms quite small but beds are much more important than bathrooms. The decor is a little faded but there was real coffee to use to make coffee in the mornings - this is the first time I have found this in an hotel and my children bought me flowers for the sitting room and my bedroom and they managed to find vases for me. We were only there for 3 days but had an itinerary which we mostly kept to. Went to see Radio City Christmas Extravaganzer - the Rockettes were wonderful and then on the following night to see Circque du Soleil, which was good but I had seen the Circque du Soleil '0' in Vegas last year and that was so incredible I did not think anything could better it - and it hasn't. We went to the Spotted Pig for dinner one night - great - but a friend had recommended The River Cafe which was absolutely wonderful. It had just started to snow as we left the theatre so we crossed the Brooklyn Bridge with snow falling! Very Christmassy! One of the things I probably wouldn't recommend is the horse-drawn buggy round a tiny corner of Central Park, although it added to the whole celebratory feel.Of course, the reason we really went was to skate in the Rockerfeller Centre and although it was drizzling slightly we had such fun - all in all, I haven't laughed so much in a long time - can there be anything better than laughing with your children? I don't think so. Stay at The Kimberly but my advice would be 'phone them directly.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel, Even Better Location Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of October. We booked a 1 bed apt through Quikbook. I rang the hotel a few weeks before arrival to ask for a room on a high floor(slightly less noise)and the lady in reservations said she would put the request onto our booking. She asked me what time our flight landed and as it was early she said she would also request an early check-in for us as we had young children.On arrival at the hotel both requests were honoured .Our room was 19E and was perfect. Spotless and spacious. The beds were very comfortable and the linen was first class.Only on our last day we discovered the remote controls for the beds!!!!!!!!!The staff were so helpful especially Kevin and Ralph .The location of the hotel is wonderful, between 3rd and Lexington on East 50th. There is a Starbucks beside the hotel, and the Subway is next to starbucks. You will hardly need it though as you are in walking distance of everything.Great Mexican restaurant Dos Caminos on 3rd avenue/East 50th crossroads (left out hotel front door - 2 mins). Make sure you try the guacamole - Wow, is it good.Loved New York. We will be back , and will stay at The Kimberely again, no doubt.

<Content>Great hotel, great location Just come back from staying 3 nights at the Kimberley. The hotel is great and spotlessly clean. The location couldn't be better. You are walking distance of The Rockefeller, Empire State Building, Macys, Times Square etc. You are given $10 vouchers for the restaurant next door, but we didn't use these as we we're always somewhere else at mealtimes (so much to see and do). We just had a standard room but this was large and the bed hugh with 3 very big pillows each it was good to get back to after lots of walking. Flat screen TV on the wall, slippers, dressing gowns, coffee making facilities and fridge, everything you need. The staff were very friendly and always willing to help, especially the door staff. We had a 2 day hop on hop off tour for $49 each. For this you could see upper and lower Manhattan, have entry into museum of New York, visit Brooklyn and have a 75 min river cruise to Statue of Liberty (this only runs in season though, as we found out after walking all the way to the dock). You also get 10% off of Planet Holliwood on Times Square, so I think good value for money! If you want to see the Statue of Liberty go on the Statten Island Ferry, this is free and goes passed the Statue. If you are thinking of going to New York you should definitely go, we can't wait to go again and we will be staying at the Kimberly when we do!

<Content>Excellent Hotel This is our second time staying at this hotel. We chose to stay there again because we know it's in a safe central location, and the hotel itself is very good all around. All staff are excellent: friendly, courteous, helpful etc, but I have to give a special mention to Kevin and the other door staff, who made us feel very welcome.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is spending time in New York.

<Content>For the money dont even think about it. For the money that my company paid more then 600 dollars a night this hotel is a huge disappointment, It desperately needs to be refurbished. Has all the ticks to be a great hotel but an early 90s room is letting it down when asking for such premium prices. I was very disappointed. I have to say the staff where excellent.

<Content>Fantastic I stayed at the Kimberley for 8 nights during September 2008, with my Mum, Dad and brother. As we are all adults, we prefer to stay in an apartment/suite hotel, as it is often more expensive to have multiple hotel rooms, without the flexibility 'your own space' offers.Overall, we were very pleased with everything at the hotel. The 2 bed room was spacious and comfortable, with the benefit of a fridge, microwave and great view (we were on the 27th floor!). The added extra of a $10 voucher per person, per day, to spend in the restaurant was great. We had the breakfast there most days (a bargain at $6!). We also took advantage of the Sunday Brunch cruise on the hotel yacht and the internet facilities in reception. To top it all off, the door staff were especially friendly and helpful and really made our stay hassle-free.The location of the hotel is also a plus - one block from the 5 line and walking distance to Grand Central station means that getting around is easy. Also walking distance to Rockefeller, Park Ave, Times Square etc. There are also many places to eat nearby and a good supermarket 2 blocks away for milk etc.

<Content>A Wonderful Experience After an exhaustive search seeking a hotel to stay we took the punt with a boutique hotel and in hindsight it was the best decision we made. Location was perfect ... close to the subway ... close to restaurants, bars, convenience stores ... close proximity to Times Sq, Rockefeller, 5th avenue shopping, etc, etc. Staff were very friendly and always willing to assist. The room and accommodation itself was first class. We do not experience one single problem within the room. Th bed was comfortable ... the bathroom clean and working ... TV was of a great size ... air con was flowing ... Loved the room. Facilities at the hotel were also good. Business centre with internet facilities were well utilised and accessible. Restaurant food was very nice and reasonably priced. In the end I would highly recommend the Kimberly Hotel to any single, couple or family. It was everything I wanted and needed ... and I travelled all the way from Australia.

<Content>Great Manhattan Location The hotel was fab. In a fantastic location in Midtown Manhattan. We only stayed in a standard room (ie not a suite) but the beds were sooo comfortable and the room was plush. The porters and concierge were lovely, helpful and didn't ask for or expect a tip once, although we did tip right at the end of the holiday. The receptionists were polite but a bit sullen and not over-friendly which was the only downside. We even got a daily $10 voucher each for a meal in the ajoining restaurant, Ferro's where we ate a lovely and reasonable priced lunch. All-in-all a fantastic place to stay and I would definately stay there again!

<Content>Fabulous Hotel In A Superb Location We had a fabulous stay at The Kimberly for 8 nights in late August/early September. No complaints from us on anything. Our room was spacious, quiet (we requested an away-from-it-all room). The beds were comfortable and linens high quality. Big, well appointed bathroom. We don't require maid service everyday and put our little don't disturb sign out. However, on the days we did want maid service, the room was impeccable. The staff was courteous, efficient and prompt. The conciere was also very helpful on helping us get around NYC. Be sure to take the free sunset cruise on the yacht they have--it's 3.5 hours and goes around the East River and up the Hudson (great views of the skyline. For $20 extra, you can enjoy the appeitzer buffet on the cruise. We didn't take advantage of membership to the health club (with pool) that the Kimberly is associated with, but we did enjoy the $10 dollar discount off the $16 full buffet at Ferro's next door. Lastly, this hotel is centrally located in a safe eastside area on 50th and close to the subway. We'll be back.

<Content>Midweek trip to NYC with the Kids My wife and I booked the Kimberly after an exhaustive review of upscale hotels in NYC that could accommodate our family of 5 (Me, my wife, our twin 5 year olds and our 4 year old). We are very picky about where we stay wherever we go. All in all the Kimberly was perfect and I would highly recommend it. The suite we had was a good size (for Manhattan), very clean, with a balcony and well above the street noise. The small kitchenette was ideal for us as it had a fridge, microwave, and was well equipped with plates, utensils, and glasses. The location was perfect, just a couple of blocks from St.Patrick's/Rockefeller center and there were two subway stations close by. We found a great bagel place and several nice restaurants within a two block radius. The staff were friendly and accommodating. We had to cut short our trip by one night due to an unforeseen circumstance and the hotel staff were very understanding. I have booked the Kimberly again for a two night trip in December and am looking forward to visiting the Kimberly again.

<Content>Outstanding service and accomodations We stayed here for our honeymoon. We were given champagne and the minibar stock for free. Our room had a balcony with two parts to it. One part of the balcony was enclosed in, so that one can be protected if it rains. The concierge arranged a sunset harbor cruise around Manhattan. The cruise was complimentary for all of the guests. The hotel is located a block from the subway, and is an easy stroll to Rockefeller Center.

<Content>We chose well we chose this as it was written up in a guide book as having great family rooms, in great location and not prohibitively pricey...the guide book was absolutely right.We had a one-bedroom suite (i think all rooms are 'suites') which had 2 double beds in the bed room, large sitting room, small but adequate bathroom and plenty of extras (extra sink, microwave, coffee perculator, 2 huge TVs, big fridge, etc etc). Hotel's having a bit of a refurb it seems of some of its room but there was little disruption. Had a light lunch in the restaurant one day and that was very good. Staff were generally very good and genuinely friendly (not just on the look out for tips).Location on East 50th between Lexington and 3rd was excellent. Negatives? Front desk was a bit sullen. Hotel only has two small lifts and so waiting for one takes a painfully long time, however they are in the process of adding a third so this should improve things.Generally really very good and if we go to NYC again with the kids, we almost certainly would return.

<Content>great hotel!!!! I would recommend this hotel to anyone! My family brought me here for my 21st birthday and I had the time of my life! New York was one of the most exciting places I have ever been to and the hotel was magnificent! When we arrived they had upgraded us to a duplex suite free of charge! the rooms were beautiful and the beds were so comfortable you completely forget about the bustle of the city and you're asleep in no time! The staff was very friendly especially helping us park, especially in manhattan! Check out the kimberly the next time you're in manhattan im sure you wont be disappointed! and be sure to ask for Ralph the door greeter!

<Content>If it's Good Enough for a U.S. President..... Just returned from NYC and a night at The Kimberly Hotel. I've stayed at a lot of hotels in the city, but this topped them all for value. I prefer the intimacy of boutique hotels and this hotel was also incredibly reasonable (comparably priced on most of the websites). The hotel website had much higher rates for the same rooms.Pros:Great location for shopping. Take the E train from Penn Station and you arrive a block from the hotel. Also plenty of cabs in the area.Our standard room was large, quiet and immaculate. Bathroom was average size, renovated with marble floors etc. and shelf space for toiletries. And the air conditioning purred - no clunking as the temperature adjusted. Comfortable beds with crisp, white sheets. And so clean - a great room.The staff is well trained and helpful. I mentioned my concern regarding the noisy rooms by the night club mentioned in some of the Trip Advisor reviews, and the receptionist immediately took care that our room was in a quiet location. Concierge provided great maps and a recommendation for a moderately priced Italian restaurant on 53rd St. between 2nd and 3rd. Felt like the East Village - 10 tables - and very inexpensive. La Gioconda - fantastic food - esp. the crepes with chocolate sauce! Thank you, Lindsay, for that recommendation. Management take note - Lindsay should be your top PR person- charming and efficient!The $10.00 coupon towards the $20.00 buffet breakfast was well worth it. We also had a late lunch there that was excellent.Cons:For the hotel, none. The area, however, was very crowded and rushed, but it is summer and the tourists are spending their Euros. And there are stores everywhere.And should I complain when there is a framed letter from President Jimmy Carter complimenting the hotel? It seems he has stayed there many times.

<Content>Bargain hotel in Mid Manhattan Central and safe. Four nights in luxurious accommodation for a fraction of the cost of the well known hotel where we usually stay a block away! Comfortable suite with kitchen, if needed, + balcony and views over Manhattan. Just two minutes walk to St Patrick's Cathedral. An incredibly busy schedule demanded a central hotel and the Kimberly provided all we needed - sumptious bedroom and separate drawing room with cosy sofas, desk and chairs. Printer/fax provided + stack of paper and laptop was up and running immediately + a Business Centre on ground floor. High quality furnishings and fabrics. Staff helpful and polite. Room service fast and efficent. In pouring rain the doorman found a taxi almost immediately - nothing was too much trouble. The restaurant was relaxed and food good. Will definitely use this hotel again, perhaps for a longer stay with teenage children as sofabeds in drawing room and plenty of room for all the family.

<Content>Cute place but ... This was our first stay in a boutique hotel and overall we've had quite a positive experience. On the positive side, the staff is excellent, the suites are spacious, and the location is great. On the negative side, the rooms are really dated (ugly green carpets), old and dirty AC units, cheap looking sofa, tiny bathroom. The reception area is very small and would benefit from more chairs (there were only 4) and air-conditioning. There was a construction (a new elevator?) at the time of our visit but we didn't notice any noice. You get $10 coupon for breakfast in the next door restaurant, which we used ones and enjoyed the quality and quantity of the bufet style food.

<Content>Not Bad Not too bad....the rooms were a mix of 4-5 star and a Courtyard Marriott style....the beds were the saving grace as they were soooooo comfy and amazing....the ac didn't work well so at times the rooms were stuffy....the staff was amazing....beyond helpful and nice...we would probably stay again as the price was great for being right in the heart of east side near everything...however we would probably check other hotels first for an over all nicer room...

<Content>Great rooms and location but lacking friendliness Arrived at the hotel after a much delayed flight was greeted by very friendly doorman but cannot say the same about the reception greeting. Reception area small and reception staff quite unfriendly.The one bedroom suite was large, clean with very comfy beds. Refurbishment work was going on at the hotel which we were aware of before booking. Whilst there were no major disturbances the workman were using the lifts and on a number of occasions we had to resort to resort to the stairs. We were given money off vouchers to use in the restaurant but we did not use them as thought there were better dining experiences elsewhere. Location was great and given the good size of the suite and room facilities would consider staying again. Hope next time reception staff will be a bit more friendly - it is New York!

<Content>Fantastic! My husband and I spent a weekend at The Kimberly for our 10th year anniversary. It was the first time either of us had been to New York City. The hotel was great! The suite provided plenty of space and it is within easy access to all the great sites such as Rockefellar Center and Times Square. You have your own kitchen and there is a market within walking distance for snacks and drinks. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The absolute best feature is the bed. Wow! The mattresses were so comfortable! Nice to come in and relax after spending the day....or night on the town. We would definitely recommend this place for couples or famililes.

<Content>Great location, homey place The Kimberly Hotel is in a great midtown location with lots of other hotels and places to eat, both humble and elegant. I agree with all of the past reviewers, that the lobby is small and pretty, with antiques, but the room was a bit tired. They are in midst of rehabbing, and I bet the newer rooms are spiffier than our suite on the 4th floor was. But it was very comfortable, clean and having a full kitchen was a treat. We were tired after a full day, and were happy to do take-out and eat at home.The bedding was really nice and reminded me of Switzerland. The down duvet was covered with fine linens, and not tucked in. The street noise was very loud, but in NYC we expected that. The staff is congenial. We'd stay here again.

<Content>You only get one chance at a first impression I鈥檓 almost torn to tell you my experience with this hotel as after initial problems we had an absolutely fantastic stay. We arrived tired after the flight from London, and were really disappointed to discover that instead of the one bedroom apartment with two double beds that we鈥檇 booked, there was only one bed in the room. No real issue, we thought a quick trip back down to reception would sort out the problem. I can honestly say in all the hotels I have stayed in, the lady on reception was the rudest and most unhelpful I鈥檝e ever come across. She said the hotel was full and she couldn鈥檛 move us, and that it was our fault. Quite how I really don鈥檛 know but we just wanted to crash out for a couple of hours and her attitude was horrific. As she was barking away I found myself reading a thank you letter on the wall from Jimmy Carter, saying what a great stay he鈥檇 had there and how courteous the staff were. Clearly this chick hadn鈥檛 been working that day鈥?br/>Anyway, we asked for the manager who turned up 10 minutes later and said he鈥檇 put a rollaway bed in the room, and then three of us would share the other bed. Luckily we鈥檙e not the tallest girls in the world, and I must say the bed was huge! We were in fact moved from 3E to 29G the next day (boy that鈥檚 high!) and a nice bottle of wine was waiting for us with an apology letter from the manager. I was later to learn that the behaviour of this one individual was not the standard the rest of the hotel staff; they were all lovely with a capital L. OK, now for the good bits. We were there for a girlie holiday (ages 22-28) with a mission to celebrate St Patrick鈥檚 Day and go shopping. The second room we had was excellent and well equipped with kitchenette, dish washer, iron and board, drinks, snacks, bath robes and wow what a view! We had a problem when the sink blocked one day and rang Hotel Maintenance, who arrived with in five minutes to fix it. As I鈥檝e said, the staff are so attentive (apart from the one awful receptionist) and the doorman Harry deserves a mention. He鈥檚 a real star and took complete care of us. The only other small gripe was the speed of the elevators. If you鈥檙e on a high floor, be prepared to wait a while then stop at most floors on the way down.The location of the Kimberly is superb, about 10 minutes walk from the shops on 5th Avenue, and with plenty of restaurants nearby (we like Houston鈥檚 on 3rd). We also spent way too much time in The Pig  Whistle, also on 3rd (go say hi to Pete and Liam) and PJ Clarkes across the street, which has an interesting oyster bar in the middle of the pub. The area has a residential feel to it and I never felt unsafe, even when walking alone at night. All in all, a fantastic hotel and I couldn鈥檛 recommend it highly enough. We were lucky enough to have this hotel paid for us, but I would imagine it鈥檚 worth every single penny. Just watch out for that one miserable check in clerk!

<Content>Good value for a nice hotel I have stayed here several times. This time I stayed in the Diplomat 2bdr suite. The bed was comfortable, The rooms had nice comfortable furnishings. Flat screen lcd TV's in each bdr and regular TV in living area. A terrace/balcony you can sit out on, but I just went out to check the weather. The hotel is a little old. The heater in each room had issues, but the staff responded immediately and fixed the problems, even on the first night when we got in at 2130. They came up right away.The staff is very nice. The buffet breakfast is pretty good and with the coupons they gave us, a bargin at $6 per person + tip, By the way, I tipped the maids $5 a day, what do other people do?The location is great. Just down from the Lex Ave subway at 50th.

<Content>Wonderful ! My daughter is currently contemplating colleges. In a misguided attempt to dissuade her from going far away in scary (to a mom) New York, I took her for a long weekend to the Big Apple. The Kimberly Hotel was in a great location, the staff could not be more helpful and the rooms were large enough to accommodate a crabby teenager and mother without any fuss. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to avoid the giant impersonal hotels, as you will have all the amenities and none of the hassle. Awesome Experience!

<Content>Make sure you get a refurbed room! We stayed in the Kimberly in November 2006, for a family get together over Thanksgiving. We chose the hotel on location and the apparent quality of the rooms, as shown on its website.When we arrived we were struck by the location, which is excellent, just to the rear of the Waldorf, a short stroll from Park Avenue. The public areas were promising too, done out in quite a stylish manner, but not too glitzy.Our room was a big disappointment. We had booked a suite that gave us a bedroom for my wife and I and a bed-sofa for our two children. Both rooms had small balconies, though the views weren't fabulous. My main problem with the room was that it looked very tired indeed, with loose fittings in the bathroom and kitchen area and a general down at heel feel to it. We phoned reception and asked what the deal was with the room not being like the one we had booked, and were told that only some of the rooms had been rennovated, and that ours was one that hadn't. We asked to see another available room, and were told that there was only one other that could accomodate us, but that it was identical to the one we had already, and was just two floors higher up the building. We grudgingly accepted the room that we had been given.Spending time in the room allowed us to see just how poor it really was. The worst thing of all was that it was a room where whatever you did, you seemed to generate enormous amounts of static electricity, so that whenever you touched anything, a shock ensued. We gave up kissing th children, as each time we were left with stinging lips! One evening I was getting their bed ready in the lounge area, and was unrolling the blankets in the dark, as it was late and we wanted to get them to bed. As I let the blanket open out, I could see a shower of small sparks!Fortunately in the wonderful city that NYC is, we did not spend a great deal of time in the room. However, this was just as well, as it was at best poor.I would rate the public areas of the hotel as a strong 3-Star, but the room a weak 2-Star, similar to a cheap hotel room in France for example.The hotel's restaurant is a dark and uninviting area off the main lobby. We ate there one eveining and had a very good meal indeed. We also tried it for lunch on the day of our departure, and found it just as good.In summary, make sure that you don't get put in the stables, and you will have a gret time at the Kimberley. We can't help feeling let down though, as my wife was very careful to check on the rooms when we booked, and then to be so disappointed on arrival is plain unacceptable.

<Content>Wow... When I was booking my 10 day 30th birthday treat in New York, I wanted something special and not too expensive. This hotel caught my eye and I was immediately seduced by the traveller photos on tripadvisor. However, although it was very cheap for what it seemed to be offering, it was a little more expensive than other hotels in the exact same area, and the money would only be justified if it really was as special as it looked (tripadvisor reviews vouched for the great amount of space, but as I was travelleing alone, charm and fantasy were much more important to me). I decided that it was too much of an expensive gamble and I went for the safe and cheaper bet of a well known chain hotel in the same area, which had raving reviews. Upon arriving in New York, even though I was satisfied with my hotel, I was curious to see 'The Kimberly' for myself (also since I'd fallen in love with New York, I wanted to check it out for future trips!) The staff were without exception immediately very welcoming, and I was shown around several different types of rooms! The lady that showed me around was obviously very proud of the hotel she worked in (that's always a good sign!). I just had to post this review on tripadvisor for all those who think this hotel is 'too good to be true' when they see the pics on the hotel website, and like me, opt for safer options and never discover the beauty of this rare place. The rooms are even more beautiful, spacious, and luxurious than they look on the website. From the gorgeous fluffy bedding to the luxrious carpet that your feet sink into as you enter the room. And so calm and sunny. I thought that being an appartment hotel it would be full of noisy kids, but actually it has more of a 'couples' feel to it than 'family' feel. It would certainly spoil the feel of the place if there were noisy kids running around, but it doesn't seem to have been designed with kids in mind. A word of advice - they have a mixture of dated and more renovated rooms. Personally, I prefer the dated ones (they're very well kept, and I prefer the charm and character of these), but I know some people would hate this decor, so don't forget to request a more modern renovated room if that's the case (I had a look at one of these too, and they are the same as the pics on the hotel website). As I say, I didn't stay here. But I fell in love with this hotel as soon as I saw it, and I thought that maybe there is someone out there reading these reviews, looking for something really unique and special for their trip to New York, and thinking like me, that it all looks too good to be true... I went for the safer option, and I was very lucky with my choice of hotel too, so I don't regret it, but I just thought this place deserved a special mention, since it really is a very special place in a wonderful location. And hopefully, someday soon, I'll be back here, and will be able to write another review...

<Content>The Kimberly: Best kept secret in NYC This is the second time I've stayed in this little haven and I can't imagine ever staying anyplace else . It is very quiet, conveniently located to all major attractions, but away from the commotion that some of the larger hotels attract. While the suites don't have designer furnishings, everything is spotless. Staff is very attentive, and without the attitude.

<Content>Great Service and Location We stayed here Dec. 20 to 23. Glad to say both elevators are now working. Never an issue. The location is great and the staff very helpful except on the last morning when we could not get anyone to answer any phone and send up a bellman for our luggage. We were in room 5c which could use some updating. The chair backs at the table were broken and it just seemed dated. My girls were very excited when they entered the lobby and then disappointed when they saw our room. The bed however is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Would definitely stay here again for the extra room, location and friendly staff.

<Content>We loved this hotel We had a long weekend in New York to celebrate our sons 18th birthday.Picked a 2 bed suite at the Kimberly as it was cheaper than booking 2 twin rooms. Room size was excellent with plenty of room to move about. Beds very comfortable, bathrooms small but functional.I think others say that the place could do with a re-fit. I guess that is true, but it certainly doesn't detract from the charm of the place.The massive LCD tellies were a little incongruous and you could argue that the money spent on them would have been better spent on new curtains, but again, i think that would be harsh.Simple fact is that its a comfortable, friendly hotel, in a great location at a reasonable price. What more do you want?

<Content>Great Value for Prime Location in Mid-Manhattan This was our second visit to the Kimberly, an all-suites hotel. We brought our children so we had a two bedroom suite, with a great view. The location is wonderful and the price was very reasonable considering its location. Obviously, this is not the Waldorf (which is only one block away) but it's great if you have your family with you and you want a kitchen and lots of room.

<Content>Great Rooms, Good Location, Pricey Very nice 1 bedroom suite in a great location near shopping and subway. Staff very friendly. This was a business junket, so we didn't have to pick up the tab. I think it was around $400/night. I could never afford to stay here on my own, but it was fun for just this one time.

<Content>Great Location, Comfortable Hotel We are 3 ladies who stayed at the Kimberly for a 4 night sight-seeing and shopping trip. we shared a one bed suite which had a huge bed in the bedroom and a pull out bed in the sitting room. The suite also had kitchen facilities although the gas supply had been disconnected for security reasons, but as all we wanted to do was make tea, coffee and toast we didn't care. We all felt extremely comfortable. There was no bar in the hotel which didn't worry us but it had a restaurant which we didn't use as we liked to try restaurants in different areas of the city each night. However next door is a great little diner for breakfast brunch, or a snack!The staff were excellent, very obliging, nothing was too much trouble. The room was cleaned daily with fresh sheets and towels, the bathroom was adequate rather than large but was more than made up for by the bedroom  sitting room.The location was brilliant, just a short walk to St Patricks Cathedral, the Rockerfella Centre and Fith Ave. (If you do nothing else in New York go to the Top of the Rock)!! Be prepared to travel for decent, reasonably priced restaurants as it is mainly expense account dining in the area so is quite pricey, we had great fun trying different places to eat and had mixed fortunes but thats all part  parcel of it. We didn't use the subway at all only taxis and had no problems and we felt they were good value. Just watch out between 5-6pm as they change shifts and can be hard to find. We would definately recommend the Kimberly if you want a comfortable hotel with no frills in the centre of the action!

<Content>A delightful stay! My husband and I spent three nights at the Kimberly Hotel and it was wonderful. Our room had a living area and a bedroom so we had plenty of room to stretch out which is unlike most hotel rooms I have stayed in New York. It was very clean and had lots of closet and drawer space. The two TV sets solved the every problematic fight over the remote control!It has the most comfortable beds that I have every tried and enough fluffy pillows to feel like a queen. What most impressed me, however, was the service. It was superb. We were always addressed by name when entering or leaving the hotel from the moment we checked in. Best of all, two weeks after we left, we discovered that we had left two shopping bags of clothes that we had purchased at Bloomingdales in one of the closets. I called the hotel and they had them in the mail to us by the next day and not one thing was missing. The only problem was that one of the elevators was not working so getting up and down was quite slow but the service and comfort of the Kimberly hotel more that made up for that glitch.

<Content>fantastic hotel I am just back from a stay in NYC and stayed at this hotel for six fantastic nights. One of the best things was the staff, they were all so friendly a special memtion to Harry the door man he was a true gent and always was happy and very helpfull.The hotel was in a great location with Smith and Wolenskys just around the corner and Mint resturant right across the street, both fantastic eating places.Four of us stayed at this hotel myself , husband and our 17 year old daughter and 14 year old son, we had a one bed suit, and the only thing we had to do was request two pull down beds for the living room as the sofa bed was very uncormftable, however this was certainly not a problem and there was plenly of room for them. the bed in the bedroom was very cormfortable.I would throughly recommend this hotel and when I go back to NYC will def stay there again. It's location was fantastic and very safe at night, the rooms were all cleaned to perfection.

<Content>Excellent hotel - would return. Stayed here for 5 nights and we were very happy overall. The only hitch when we were there was our friends got stuck in the elevator which was very scary for them, but was taken very lightly by the hotel.The elevators seem very old and seem to break down frequently. I believe that they should be replaced.Other than that were were pleased with the hotel. It's a great location.Laura

<Content>My Favorite in NYC I've stayed at the Kimberly a couple of dozen times over the last 15 years. It's my first choice of hotel in NYC and I stay there whenever I can. For the price of a 5 star hotel room you get a full suite with very comfortable bed and a lovely living room, just like an apartment. (It was actually built as an apartment building.)The staff is excellent and some (including Kevin, the doorman) have been there since I started staying there in the early 1990s.The only drawbacks: the elevators are slow, it's a bit tough to catch a cab in front of the hotel (I usuall walk two doors over to third ave) and it can get a bit pricey in high season.But it's luxurious, updated, clean and very comfortable, in a perfect location.

<Content>Loved the location This hotel was exactly what we were looking for. With 2 teenaged daughters, we needed a two bedroom w/ 2 baths. The bonus was the living area and small kitchen we used for snacks and breakfast. The price is better than gettting two hotel rooms at a similar property. The subway is 1.5 blocks away and covenient to everything NYC has to offer. We were on the 29th floor with views of the Chrysler building - we heard no traffic noise this high up. The staff (especially the bellmen) were very friendly and helpful.The only negative is that I have to agree with other reviews that the rooms and baths need to be refurbished. The only thing updated thus far are the flat screen tv's. It is not a fancy hotel, but suited our needs and space requirements.

<Content>Great hotel, but...... We recently booked two suites for a long weekend. The rooms are updated, beds very comfortable, large, bathroom average. One suite had no air conditioning from either a/c unit for two nights. The other suite lost a/c from the unit in the bedroom for one night. While everything else looks very nice, a/c units look (and sound) very old and unreliable. Staff very accommodating.

<Content>A patchy experience The location is very convenient, the staff was very helpful and courteous but the hotel itself is definitely in need of upgrading. Our room on the 18th floor was large and would have been great except for the feeling that it hadn't been maintained or refurbished in years. I also didn't feel that it had been cleaned very well. The bathroom especially is in need of work. And a more modern air conditioner that lets you sleep wouldn't go amiss.

<Content>Awesome beds! Looking for a central, comfortable hotel in midtown? You can鈥檛 do much better than The Kimberly. Rooms were larger than average, staff very accommodating, beds are just awesome! Huge and very comfortable.Little noisy at night with traffic, even though we were on the 8th floor but where in NY isn鈥檛? We didn鈥檛 eat here at all but the place is surrounded by great restaurants and cafes so you won鈥檛 go hungry. 5 mins to the main shopping areas and 10 mins walk to Bloomingdales.Will definitely stay here again!

<Content>Home away from home Loved this hotel! Our apt. suite was more than I could have hoped for. I have made many trips to N.Y. city and stayed in quite a few 4 star hotels. This by far was the best. Every day that I returned to my suite I felt like I was coming home to my own apt. instead of just a plain hotel room. The livingroom combo kitchen was big enough for a small party. The bedroom was bigger than most 4 star hotels with more than enough room as not to feel cramped. Both rooms had windows that took up an entire wall. Great open feeling. The balcony was to die for. It was really nice to be able to have my morning coffee sitting on the balcony and looking up at the sky. The maid service was excellent. Very clean. The resturant is some of the best Italian food I have ever had in New york. I have found my home away from home.

<Content>Rooms nice, elevators performance bad Suite was very nice and the beds extremely comfortable. Good location within walking distance to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Central park etc. We had a nice dinner at Fretto's next door and a good buffet breakfast there too. Doorman was very pleasant and helpful as were the concierges.Only 2 complaints. Room was noisy from all the air conditioning units on the roof below us. Worst of all was the situation with the lifts. Typically one of them was not working so the other was over used by 29 floors of rooms. On our last day we waited about 30 minutes for the lift to stop on our floor to take our cases etc to check out. Major rehaul of the lifts is sorely needed

<Content>Wonderful Hotel I was referred to the Kimberley Hotel by a good fiend who said the location was great and the kitchens were a nice addition for snacks, drinks and anything else you could want while staying in a hotel. She was right. The location was awesome. Almost everything you need is within walking distance. You can pick up fresh produce and grocery items 2 blocks away, there is a liquor store across the street from that. Bars, restaurants, shops, everything you can imagine is nearby.But the best part of our stay was the beds! I have never slept in a more comfortable bed in my life! We had a two bedroom suite with one king bed and one queen and they were both heaven to sleep in.The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great stay at The Kimberly One of the nicest hotels we've stayed in. The staff was most accomodating and attentive. The rooms were lovely, the bed was wonderful. We were in town for our daughter's wedding and had booked several rooms. Upon the last check-in there was a slight miscommunication, however it was immediately taken care of. The location was very convenient, yet quiet. We will absolutely return to The Kimberly.

<Content>A Small but Lovely Hotel My sister and I stayed at the Kimberly for one night. It was lovely. The beds in the rooms were ultra comfortable. The rooms are equipped w/ safes and even an room alarm, so I felt very safe. The staff was professional and nice, especially the doorman.All in all, I was very satisfied with the Kimberly and would stay there again.(By the way, Jimmy Carter has and continues to stay at the Kimberly when he goes to NYC. Posted at the front desk is a framed letter written by Carter in which he lauds the hotel).

<Content>Wonderful hotel were it was safe to walk at any time We stayed here for our 20 anniversary and found the location to be fantastic. We love to walk and were located less then a 20 minute walk from Time Square, Central Park or Grand Central Station and just around the corner from Rockerfeller Center and lots of shoppping. It did not matter the time of day we walked we always felt safe compared to other areas of Manhattan. There were door man at every hotel in this area as well as alot of extra security due to all the diplomats staying in the area. Our Room was 6I and had a large dressing area and bathroom plus sitting area with 2 queen size beds. The beds were very nice with nice cozy feather comforters. The umberllas in the room were a nice touch to bad we didn't take one with us on one of our walks. The concierge was knowledgable and helpful but Rolph the doorman was great recomending little pubs and getting taxi or limos.

<Content>Good Boutique Hotel We have recently returned from a 4 night stay at the Kimberly. In short the hotel is slightly dated and in need of some refurbishment. However this should not detract from staying there. The reception staff were efficient but where this hotel comes into its own is the doormen and the concierge. Each of whom were absolutely fantastic. I am very lucky as I work in the travel industry and get to see many countries and stay in some very beautiful hotels but I have to say the guys on the door were so courteous and the concierge very knowledgable it was a pleasure to be greeted by them when coming back to the hotel after a busy day. The suite itself was very clean and tidy but as stated a little dated. The only area for complaint was the bad attitude of one of the bar staff in the restaurant one young girl in particular. She really let the hotel down with her very poor customer service. Not in keeping with the rest of The Kimberly staff! Excellent location for all areas and close to the subway. Walk down out of the hotel a few blocks to where you will find some excellent restaurants Italian, Seafood and French all very reasonably priced.

<Content>Would not recommend the Kimberly Hotel After a great 3 night stay at the Kimberly Hotel in May 2006 I booked again for a 4 night stay in October 2006 but this time requesting a luxury suite for 4 nights - Again the staff was outstanding but unfortunately the luxury suite did not meet the standard I was anticipating. I stayed in suite 23G. Not only was the bathroom much smaller that the one during my past stay, the plug for the Jacuzzi tub did not work, that was one of the main reasons for getting the luxury suite. The faucet in the mini bar came off in my hand and that sink was unusable, I had problems with the safe, the drapes in the living room would not close leaving an opening of 8 feet, had problems with the wall mounted TV. After returning home I wrote a letter the the manager whose name I was given at the front desk and did not receive any response from the Kimberly Hotel. I would not stay there again and woudl not recommend that hotel to anyone.Why did I wait so long to place this - I just found Trip Advisor - staying at the Benjamin Hotel at the end of May and this time booked two suites, one for myself and the other for friends.

<Content>Really Good Location and Wonderful service This was a first visit to NYC for my husband and myself and The Kimberly was just what we were looking for in location, ambiance and service. We did not want a huge hotel that was impersonal. The size of the room was fantastic, especially because we had read so much about the small size of rooms in NYC. The full kitchen was terriffic because we had breakfast and sometimes dinner in. We felt we had our own apartment in midtown with the large living room and separate bedroom. The gas to the cook stove was turned off in the entire building due to safety concerns but it really wasn't necessary to our enjoyment.The hotel is obviously older and a little out of date fashion-wise but is very well maintained and very clean. The service from reservations to front desk to bell staff and doormen could not have been better. Their friendlyness and kind recommendations were consistant and helpful.The location was great for walking many places as well as very near the subway.We loved walking just two blocks to 2nd street between 50th  51st Ave for some great reasonably priced resturants as well as a good market. The Jamison provided a simple good meal with clean cozy ambiance one nite. On two other evenings we ate at Pasta Presto  Grill for really good meals that were incredably well priced. We could not believe how people would wait hours for overpriced mediocure food from chains that you could get at any city in America instead of walk a few blocks to wonderful little neighborhoods for a really special meal, great ambiance and reasonable prices. We recommend this hotel highly to friends and family and look forward to going there again.

<Content>Really great Hotel Went for an all girls week in October 2006 and were pleased with the 2 bedroom, 2 bath suite at $635 per night. Five of us stayed and did not feel cramped in any way. It was nice having the refrigerator and microwave for a light breakfast before we set out for the day or for a late evening dessert. The only small complaint we had was 1) the sofa bed was very uncomfortable and 2) the stove did not work. However, the hotel was quick to offer a 30% discount to the restaurant located dowstairs and brought up a roll-away to replace the sofa bed. This hotel is located very near a subway entrance and within walking distance to many sights. The room was quiet, clean and furnished nicely. I would recommend it highly.

<Content>Large rooms in the heart of midtown Although I'm not a fan of midtown, and I much prefer to stay downtown, I was traveling with my teenage son, so we needed two beds, plenty of room, and some privacy from each other.Downtown hotels are extremely expensive, and geared toward couples (not the mom  son variety!). So I was forced to look midtown and chose the Kimberly for their wide variety of rooms, at a decent price.I booked directly with the hotel in December for February 17-19, repeated all my requirements, including the date, and when I called back to confirm, they said you were a no show for January 17-19. I was outraged, as pretty much the first thing a reservations clerk should get right is The Date. Prices had gone up considerably since I had originally booked, but they honored the original price for a one-bedroom suite. They screwed up, but they made up for it. Can't fault them there.Valet parking was swift and seamless, just the way I like it. As midtown is particularly busy, this was particularly important. We arrived early (10:00 a.m.) and our suite was already available for us. Another plus.I opened the door, and the first thing I noticed was the Absence of Cigarette Smoke. Another plus. So many hotels say the room is no smoking, but they consider it no smoking if You don't smoke in there. Our suite was fresh smelling, clean, and Huge. Large kitchen, fully stocked with all the cookware you could ever need, large livingroom with pull-out queen sofa bed (my son said it was a bit uncomfortable, but being a teenager, didn't mind roughing it), and the master bedroom was huge and nicely appointed. Linens were high quality, the matress was comfortable, loads of pillows, and the comforter was a Very high quality down. Quite nice.Bathroom was very small, but after staying in many NYC hotels, I've become used to that. Shower pressure okay, nothing great, but no real complaints.Unfortunately, although my suite was no smoking, the Floor was not no smoking, and the hallways reeked of cigarettes. Not because anybody smoked in the hallways --- they didn't. But because the people in the suites across from mine were smokers, the fumes crept out into the hallway. Waiting for the elevator, outside Mr.  Mrs. Tobacco's suite, was brutal.Hey Kimberly Hotel --- take a hint from your neighbors at The Benjamin: Make your entire hotel no smoking.Beyond that, a glorious stay. As all our activity was downtown, we either walked or took the bus, and the bus stops frequently on Lexington Ave. (downtown bound) and Third Ave. (uptown bound), with many stops along the way.People behind the lobby desk are a bit aloof, but they get the job done. The bellhops and attendants who open the door and help you out are Fantastic. Extremely well-mannered and cheery, without being intrusive.If the Kimberly were downtown, I'd definitely stay there again. If you're looking for a midtown hotel with large, clean rooms, competitively priced, and comfortable accommodations, I'd recommend it.

<Content>Great Room, Great Location, Great Value Stayed at Kimberly for business earlier this week. It was my first time there and I was pleased in just about all aspects of the stay. Check-In was fast and efficient. The room was a good size and although you could tell the hotel is a bit on the older side of things, the room was very clean, and very large. Furnishings were of a good to very good quality, and room was quiet (15th floor). The king-sized bed was very comfortable and there were plenty of lights to complement the large windows in both the living room and bedroom areas. True, the rooms do not have flat-screen televisions, but both TVs worked just fine, and when I am in NYC, I am not there to watch TV if I can avoid it. Other reviewers may whine about this fact, but to me if the TV still works fine, why waste resources on a new one just to be trendy? (If you want trendy, stay somewhere else). Breakfast at the restaurant was ok, nothing special but not bad either...but a good value as it was included in the room rate for the stay. Staff was friendly and efficient. Location is just a half block away from the subway. From a value-for-money perspective, it was one of the best deals I have had in New York. You can spend twice as much for a room half the size in the same location, and it will probably be noiser. Because there only a handful of rooms on each floor, and the bedrooms are offset from the main hallway, you have next to no noise from the interior of the building at night to disturb your slumber. Overall, I would give this place a big endorsement and will stay there again.

<Content>Disappointing Stay at the Kimberly We chose to stay at the Kimberly because of its excellent reviews. Unfortunately, we were horribly disappointed. While the Hotel Manager was very nice, the Assistant Hotel Manager/Concierge was argumentative and rude. Additionally, the gentleman at the front desk technically did his work by checking us in, but he was not very helpful with our questions and acted like he'd rather be anywhere else than working at the front desk.The linens and towels in the room were beautiful and top-class. Unfortunately, the room itself was quite shabby and run-down. It was very obvious that this property was a converted apartment building and that no one had bothered to renovate this room (on the 4th floor). It was quite nice having a suite, but, once again, the furniture was old and worn out, the tvs were definitely old (compared to state-of-the-art tvs we've experienced at other hotels), and the room just looked terribly old and run-down. It was a huge disappointment from what we had been anticipating from reading other readers' reviews.At the front desk, there is a display of a letter from Jimmy Carter. I'm sure he had a much nicer room.

<Content>Excellent stay at 'the Kimberley' My wife and I stayed at the Kimberley Hotel for six days over this Christmas period.The Hotel met all our expectations:Although the foyer is on the small side all of the staff are polite and very efficient.Our room was very large containing numerous storage cupbords, large wardrobes, two TV's, a bed wider than it was long ( very Comfortable), lounge area with a three peice suite and coffee table, Kitchen aea with all neccesary appliances, balcony.The only minor disapointment was that the bath was small, more of a huge shower tray and the shower was really powerful.Finally our moring breakfast was something that we both looked forward to. Basically a buffet with every style of breakfast food available including a designated egg man. Fantastic it was a pleasure tipping such service.

<Content>My Family Still Raves about the Kimberly Hotel This trip to New York was for our 2 daughter's (ages 6 and 8) birthday extravaganza weekend. We traveled to NYC on December 2 and 3rd to do the American Girl, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, Central Park activities and had a blast. The Kimberly was perfect for our family of 4 and for friends of ours who traveled with us with 3 kids. The hotel was clean and nicely appointed. The location was fabulous and the staff, amazing. Harry, the doorman, was so kind to the children, he not only spoke to them, but played with them and made them feel like they were really welcome at the hotel. We will definitely go back to stay at the Kimberly.

<Content>Splendid!!!!!!!! This hotel is Great! It is in a brilliant location very close to three subway lines which is helpful for when you want to visit the attractions. All of the staff were friendly and helpful especially Raulph the doorman who gave us lots of resteraunt recommendations. Thee rooms were clean and comfortable and the addedextras e.g. robes, free internet access etc were great.The rooms were large by NYC standards and you have never felt beds like the ones at the Kimberley - Think goose/duck down and lots of it!! fabulous!If you have the capacity to afford the Kimberley the location (10mins walk from Rockerfeller and central park) and the great hotel atmosphere especially at Christmas are well worth it. Pictures to follow!

The room was immaculate and the beds were wonderfully comfortable. The staff was friendly and anxious to please. I will definitely stay at Kimberly on future trips to NY.

<Content>Great location, large room, decent price Per the recommendation of one of my colleagues, I stayed here on a recent business trip. By NYC standards, the room and bathroom were large. Both were clean but a little worn around the edges--small chips on the furniture, some staining on the grouting in the tub, etc. However, everything I needed was there: two very comfortable and luxuriously dressed beds, iron/ironing board, hairdryer, bathrobes, small fridge, good sized closet and, down in the lobby, staff members that were very polite and eager to please. Staff quickly got me a cab when I needed it, but the Lexington/51st Street subway stop is literally just around the corner. I paid $255 a night, and although that's not cheap by any means, it is a very competitive price for NYC right now. Given its convenient midtown lcoation--Rockefeller Center is a couple of blocks away--the Kimberly was perfect for my trip.

<Content>okay place, great location I booked this trip 6 months ago and got a good price of $255/nite when most comparable places were over $300 at the time I booked. I think it's worth the money I paid, but nothing more. Front desk staff was nice but not terribly knowledgable nor seasoned. We checked in late (11pm) and were given a room with 2 double beds instead of the queen/king we'd requested. (It was our anniversary). They said they never guaranteed those requests, but said they'd check in the morning. Sure enough, they moved us the next day (had to repack!!) to a room in the front of the building w/ a king bed. Double paned windows reduced the street noise just fine (we're used to a little urban noise). Size was decent for a NYC hotel room; bed and linens were really nice, and there were 2 dressers and a small closet. Bathroom was okay, but NO counterspace or any place to put toiletries. (The first room we had actually had a lot of counterspace AND a separate dressing room with a counter.) Overall, the place needs sprucing up - chipped surfaces, dusty fixtures (including the coffeemaker!), showing its age. There are 3 other hotels in the same block which, at times, have had competitve prices. They all looked nicer. Restaurant next to the hotel looked JUST okay (Im a food snob); the bar was fun, with impromptu opera and jazz singers taking the mike. The best bagels in the world around the corner on Third Ave. Great location in Midtown East, easy to get up- or downtown by walking. Subway stops close to get anywhere. Not a bad experience for the price and location.

<Content>Excellent Choice for Familes Our family of four just returned from a lovely 4-night stay at the Kimberly. Our one-bedroom suite was spacious and well appointed, although my son preferred to sleep on the sofa itself rather than the sofa bed. The bed linens, robes and towels were of very high quality. Having a kitchen is a godsend when traveling with children in an expensive city. We were on a low floor on the back, which meant that we had no street noise (a very welcome change from our last stay at a different NYC hotel), but the proximity to the air-conditioning units meant that we couldn't use the balcony. There was plenty of closet space. The bell staff and doormen could not have been better. The location - a fairly quiet hotel-laden street - was excellent as well.We enjoyed our stay and would not hestitate to return in a minute. Moreover, considering the price of even modest hotel rooms in NYC during the peak month of October, I thought we received excellent value for our money/

<Content>Cozy Little Place The Kimberly was wonderful. It was full yet I never heard any noise from the hallway. My bed was extremely comfortable; I rarely sleep as well as I did on this visit. The staff was professional. My air handler was a little noisy but everything else was great. They even had Neutrogena products in the room; nice!

<Content>The PERFECT hotel for a family vacation My husband and I took our 14 and 16-year old daughters to NYC for 10 days, and I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL HIGHLY ENOUGH!I used to travel to NYC on business every few weeks, and finding a spacious hotel room at ANY price can be a challenge. I really wanted the girls to see New York, but I was dreading sharing a cramped space with all of their stuff...I thought we would be climbing all over each other and their 30 pairs of shoes. But we stayed in the Executive One Bedroom Suite at the Kimberly for $420/night, and it was HUGE...king bedroom and nice masterbath, second 1/2 bath (godsend!), large living room/dining room combination with pull-out sofa bed (queen size, I think), fully-equipped kitchen (nice way to save a little money in an expensive city!), dining room that seats 6, balcony with a view of the Chrysler building, and 5 closets. Compare that to any accomodations for 4 in Times Square -- or even an apartment rental -- and you'll see what an incredible deal that is. (Book early...I think they only have one with a second half bath). They also have luxury suites with upgraded bathrooms, but this was very nice and perfect for our family.Great location in mid-town so you can get anywhere you want to go easily. I highly recommend this hotel, especially for families with teenagers (btw: I didn't think it was possible, but we spent 10 days on vacation with our daughters and never heard I'm SO BORED once!....Worth every penny!)

<Content>A good, not great option for those needing suites. Stayed at the Kimberly Sept 11-15. Had stayed at the Waldorf previously but needed a two bedroom suite with kitchenette and this fit the bill. The location is superb; easily within walking distance of any midtown adventure you would want. Staff: Very accommodating, especially the doormen. Although on arrival, our check in person (the blonde) kept us waiting while she finished a personal call. On departure our doorman had a tough time getting a taxi and walked down the street to Lexington (in the rain) to flag one going south and get it down our way. Room service was generally good; however, we did have to call down twice on one request. Facility: Know in advance that this is a converted apartment house. Thus the lobby is small and congestion around the elevators (if they are running) is not unusual. The elevators are old and unreliable as has been posted before. One of the two was out of service for our entire stay. The one remaining elevator was over challenged to support both client and hotel staff needs. After the first day, every time we left our room we started making bets on: 1) how long it would take to get one to our floor (the 24th), and 2) how many times it would stop on the way down. The hotel management tried to make amends for the inconvenience and offered a free breakfast at their Ferro鈥檚 restaurant for all clients. Bedrooms are nicely sized and the linens are superior. The bathrooms are nicely appointed; however small. The blow-dryer must be used standing up鈥?my wife did not appreciate this feature. Our two room suite was in need of a really good cleaning and paint job (the breakfast bar had been touched up with paint that didn鈥檛 match). Screening of upholstery condition left something to be desired. We discovered one sofa pillow that had what appeared to be vomit on one corner as did part of one sofa cushion鈥?.and it wasn鈥檛 fresh. We had a nice balcony with a great open view. It faced the Chrysler building and it was fun to watch the lights disappear in the lowering fog. The kitchenette offers all necessary items (including corkscrew) and we made a quick trip to the Food Emporium on 52nd and 2nd and the Beekman Liquors store at 500 Lexington to stock up. Note that Beekman only carries high end wines and liquors at commensurate prices. There are no deals. Our doorman later suggested Diplomat Liquors on second, also about two blocks away. The refrigerator/freezer has two ice trays and you should take every opportunity to keep them filled (check whether the freezer setting is on full cold otherwise it鈥檒l take a while for the ice to form). There are no other ice machines available except the one in the basement which is accessible only through room service. Would we go back? Probably not as a couple. If we had another couple to travel with again and wanted the suite option we鈥檇 consider it.

<Content>Great Location and Value! I've stayed in New York many times and thought the Kimberly was the best deal for the money, particularly if you have a family. My sister, two nieces and I had a one bedroom suite with two beds, kitchenette, living room, and balcony (which the girls loved). The beds were very comfortable and the kitchen was well-equipped and convenient for breakfast, quick snacks and happy hour. I felt we had plenty of room to spread out, keeping in mind that hotel rooms in New York are usually small. A word of caution, however, this type of room is not guaranteed. Another friend and her two daughters were with us and they also had a one bedroom suite, but no balcony and a king bed (although I requested 2 doubles for both rooms when I made the reservation with Express, which is now Quikbook). The only negative is the pull out sofa - it's uncomfortable, but we just requested a bunch of pillows and it worked fine. It's very well located for shopping, sightseeing and the park, with the theatre district about a 10-15 minute walk. The subway is also convenient and taxis are plentiful. The staff couldn't have been nicer, especially the bellmen and doormen. Part of our group was taking the train to DC and they were able to get all of our luggage in the trunk (and young girls don't pack light!).

<Content>Fantastic hotel ! we stayed in a one bed suite with a king bed and seperate living room which had a pull out sofa bed-ideal if you have children as we have. The room was beautifully appointed with a kitchen full of the necessary cutlery etc, and we were most impressed at the standard of the towels and linens but best of all was the fabulous bed which is probably the best we have ever encountered in a hotel. The hotel is in a great location close to the subway on lexington and has a good irish pub just two streets away and numerous coffee shops in the area. The staff were great especially Harry the doorman who made our seven year olds day every time he greeted her with a high five and a hiya princess! We would definitely stay here again as the location, service and standard of the rooms are wonderful for the rate that this hotel charges. I would certainly recommend it to everyone.

<Content>It was pretty good! My family and I stayed at this hotel for two nights. The lobby is tiny, but very warm and welcoming. We stayed at a one bedroom suite. The rooms were at a very reasonable price: about #300 per night. They were quite small, like the lobby, but very comfortable. I liked that there was a fully-equipped kitchen, and a nice dining room. The beds were relaxing, but the queen sized sofa bed was too springy and when I woke up, my back was aching. There were great amenities, but the Internet access is a little pricey. (I mean, $7.95 for 24 hours!) There is a printer/fax/copier on the desk too. The service is extremely friendly; they are polite and very kind to children. The dining here is great too. I have tried their breakfast buffet, and it was very good. On weekdays, the breakfast buffet is free for people staying at the hotel, but for outsiders, it is not complimentary. Overall, it was a very nice stay at the Kimberly Hotel.

<Content>Great Giirls Weekend!! Just back from a great ladies getaway for a long weekend of eating, shopping, theatre-going and laughing! The Kimberly was an important factor in our enjoyable escape. The doormen were all very helpful and charming. The room was very comfortable,quiet and spacious ( by N.Y. standards) and the bed very comfy. The A/C worked very well during our extremely hot weather. Having been many times to N.Y. this hotel ranks highly in my mind. Location is ideal......close to Bloomingdales- 5 min. walk...and not far from Rockefellar Center and Fifth Ave. Fine breakfast places nearby.

<Content>loved this hotel!!! I can't remember when I've stayed in a nicer hotel. The location was wonderful. The rooms are small but very comfortable. At night your bed is turned down and they put music on from the bose clock radio. There was a good size refrigerator and icrowave. The refrigerator even had an ice maker. There are plush terry cloth robes you can use. There's even a pillow menu. You can chose from 1 of 10 pillow types. The bathroom is very nice and clean. If you want a nice view you're going to have to sacrifice quiet. The inside suites are facing other apartment buildings but the upside is the room is quiet. There's a great lunchenette right down the street. We ate both dinner and lunch there once. All in all I think this was a great hotel. I would go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>not great when NY is hot i read how great this place was and must admit i was quite disapointed. I stayed in 3J. I arrived last week sunday to the NY heat wave to discover that i was never going to get the room cool with the 100 year old airconditioner that seems to exist in so many old ny hotels.Other than that the stay was fine but nothing memorable. Maybe a touch bigger than the cool boutique hotels, bed was good, but otherwise disapointing after reading reviews. Going to try the sofitel next week when i am back

<Content>That's right - believe the great reviews! My family of four stayed at the Kimberly from June 30 to July 11, 2006. It was our first trip to NYC, and the hotel was fabulous. The suite was great; plenty of room for the adults in one room and the children on a queen sized pull out sofa bed. The location was terrific; subway entrance to the 6 on Lexington was literally around the corner. Easy walking to Rockefeller Center and 5th Avenue. Any questions or concerns were promptly handled by the extremely friendly staff. The full kitchen was wonderful. With Ess-A-Bagel around the corner, we were set for breakfast for the entire trip. We definitely recommend the KImberly, and plan to stay there again when we have the opportunity to return to New York.

<Content>Believe the great reviews! We thoroughly enjoyed everything about our recent 6 night stay at the Kimberly. The staff is helpful, friendly and courteous. The Kimberly resides in a safe and centrally located part of Manhattan. This was our first trip to NYC and we were able to walk or take the subway to any part of Manhattan with little or no direction. Our hotel room was nicely appointed with a great bed and full kitchen. We took the subway to Union Square for groceries at Trader Joe's and/or Whole Foods and saved a lot of money preparing our own meals using all the dishes and utensils provided. Also, our suite was the quietest room we've ever stayed in; we heard no neighbor noise the entire time! Believe all these positive reviews - this is a wonderful place to stay and we will do so again on our next trip to the city.

<Content>Superb Kimberly My husband and I stayed here June 8-15, we were very pleased with our suite, noise was not a problem, (ear plugs provided but not necessary) The staff were courteous and pleasant, and efficiently handled our few requests. We were very impressed with the doormen, not only were they helpful, they rushed to open doors and always greeted us with a big smile. Great location, and the river cruise is an added bonus. Will definately stay at the Kimberly again, and will recommend it to our friends.

<Content>Great Location! We stayed at the Kimberly from 6/11 to 6/15/06. Great hotel, location, service!! We were given hotel options by our travel agent and after checking the reviews of all on tripadvisor.com we selected The Kimberly (145 East 50th). The room size was perfect (small apartment size) and very clean. Was better than any other hotel we have stayed in....bed was so comfortable and the down pillows were an extra touch. The hotel staff were very friendly and professional....especially Edgar (night desk) and Ralph (doorman). You can't beat the location as it is close to restaurants, museums, United Nations, etc.. At night we felt it was very safe to walk to dinner or just walk, walk, walk. We ate almost every morning at the New York Luncheonette two doors away....good food at reasonable prices. A block over, AuBonPain is great for pastries, coffee, bagel. Subway entrance is really close to the Kimberly and we took advantage of that by riding to Union Square to Havana Central (delicious Cuban food!) for dinner. If you are looking for a quiet bar/lounge (with windows for people watching) then try Lily's which is just a block over from the hotel. Really can't say enough good things about this hotel. Would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Fantastic elegance, location and service . I simply will not stay anyplace else. We have lived in NYC and this was the best of returns. The location ,near the Lex subway, the bus, the restaurants, and Bloomies , is wonderful .It is the staff from the doormen , who run the street, to the concierge and all the others who make your stay so enjoyable. Very confortable rooms with storage that is unusual. Beds to die for!

<Content>Clean Convenient Kmberly Kimberly is a clean convenient hotel close to the Grayline Tour bus stop and number 6 (1 block) train. We requested a King bed and when we arrived we not only got a King but were upgraded to a suite with a balcany. Did not eat at the restaurant looked good and they do offer room service. Staff was very attentive and always had a smile. Location was good, far enough from Times Square but not to far that you couldn't walk.

<Content>Just as wonderful the second time around My husband and I spent 5 nights here from 5/25 thru 5/30. This was out second stay at the Kimberly and it was again a great experience. We had a one-bedroom suite on the 20th floor overlooking 50th street. Having an in-room safe, two tv's, a full kitchen, and such comfortable beds make this a home away from home. We paid $279 a night plus $10 a day for internet service . . .certainly not cheap . . . but moderately priced for NYC. I'm sure we'll stay there next time we visit the city.

<Content>Great Stay We arrived very late at night and on the way to the hotel from the airport we were pretty tired from traveling. We arrived at the hotel around midnight and after unloading and checking in, we all felt wide awake. We decided to walk around a little bit, and boy are we glad we did. The area was so alive and we felt safe walking around at that time of night. The subway is right around the corner and everything is so easy to get to from here. Great walking area. You get a great feel of the big city here. The staff was so pleasant the entire time. We stayed on the 28th floor so we didn't hear alot of street noise. The streetnoise we did hear was pleasant sounding because after all, you are in a big city and it's a big part of it. We had a great balcony. Our room had plenty of space and we did not feel cramped at all. We felt it was the size of a small apartment. When I return to NYC, I will plan on staying here again.

<Content>Fantastic! The Kimberly is, truly, a gem!! Stayed for three wonderful nights in the two story and cannot say enough good things about the accomodations and the staff. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warmth and the utmost in hosptitality. The beds were glorious- down mattress pads and comforters!! Soft sheets!! Thick plush towels!! And the location cannot be beaten- perfect central location. I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else in the future.

<Content>Superb New York Hotel We spent a fantastic 3 nights , 4days , at the Kimberley this April. The staff from the moment we checked in to the moment we left were first rate.They were all polite , attentive and very friendly without being overbearing.Our room was the best we have spent in a Hotel anywhere.It was actually a suite including small kitchen area , Lounge , Bedroom and bathroom.It was spotlessly clean and the Kingsize bed was just fabulous.I snore a lot ( Allegedly ! ) but even my wife could'nt here me we were so far apart .She was also very impressed with the standard of the bed linen.We will certainly book this hotel for our next Visit.Andrew and Julie Newsome UK

Courteous staff, gorgeous accomodation - I've let colleagues and friends know and I wouldn't even bother trying any other hotel now. The location is great with a good deli close by and the proximity to all the stores - I could go on......

<Content>Such elegance! I loved The Kimberly! It's small, as hotels go, but I never felt claustrophobic in it and especially not in my room. The parlor was comfortable, the kitchen surprisingly complete, and the bedroom was QUITE spacious with an awesome bed. The staff was delightful, especially the doorman, an older African American man, who was quick with a smile and never, ever gave me the feeling he was looking for a tip (which made me tip him more!).It's conveniently located to many midtown attractions and also the subway at 51st and Lexington.I would definitely stay here again, but word to the wise: make sure you get your car out of the garage within a 24 hour time period or they will charge you for an extra day, even if you're only a minute or two late!

<Content>Annual Girls Trip I travel to NYC with my Best Friend every year. It seems more of our friends join us each trip. This past year we had a party of 4 so we rented a 2 bedroom suite at the Kimberly. It was so perfect. The most spacious room we have ever had in NYC. We had a private balcony and the bedding was dreamy. We did not use the kitchen except to store cold drinks in the fridge. They even provided us with umbrellas when it rained. I would and have recommended this hotel to others and will be visiting again myself. This only downside was one of the girls slept on the pull out sofa bed. It was not at all comfortable while the rest of us has luxury bedding.

<Content>This hotel is in a great location. I stayed at the Kimberly Hotel with my two teenage children in March 2006. We were in a one bedroom suite which was very large in relation to other New York hotels I've stayed in. The two double beds were comfortable, but the pull out sofa was horrible. The staff was very friendly and helpful save for the cleaning staff. They were unfriendly and loud in the hallways. I cannot say enough positive things about the bell and door staff though. They were very attentive and never hesitated to help us find a cab and our luggage was tended to quickly. If you want a location that is within walking distance of Central Park South, Rockefeller Center and Times Square than it's perfect. Personally I prefer staying in a quieter neighborhood and taking the subway or a cab to midtown. Overall it's good value for the price.

<Content>Nice location I spent 5 days with my two teens at the Kimberly Hotel. We had a one bedroom suite which worked out quite well for us. We had a good rate with Expedia. I considered upgrading to the luxury collection which is the renovated upper floor area but it would have been an extra $ 200/night. Also, I had read that the sofa beds are not comfortable (this is an UNDERSTATEMENT) the springs dig into your back! The hotel has a $ 30/night charge for rollaway cots. The beds in the room were quite comfortable and also had a remote control to lift the head and foot rests for the mattress but only one worked...On the positive side, the hotel is in a perfect location. We walked to the Rockafeller centre, Times Square, Fifth Avenue, etc. The Starbucks ( 1 block west) is a fast and easy spot to grab breakfast. This was better than the breakfast buffet in the hotel. I would most likely choose this hotel again as it is centrally located and in a safe area.

<Content>Perfect for a Girls' Shopping Trip Three friends of mine and I stayed at The Kimberly from December 1 until December 4, 2005. We're in our thirties and have each traveled extensively. We stayed in a two-bedroom suite on the 27th floor. It was a corner room with a balcony. We had more space than we could have ever put to use. (It did come in handy for all the shopping bags.) The staff was fabulous and the location was ideal for our purposes. The decor in our suite could be updated but really, how much time do you spend in the room when in NYC. It was exceptionally clean and the beds were to die for. I would recommend this hotel to anyone except those looking for an extremely posh and romantic hotel for their stay. We鈥檒l definitely be back!

<Content>Great for Families We stayed at the Kimberly Hotel Dec. 11-14 in a 2br suite. It was very spacious for a family of four adults and one small child. I was quite impressed with the cleanliness of the suite. We arrived early and our room was already available. The staff is very considerate and helpful, most especially the doormen. We were always met with a smile whether we were coming or going. I found the location ideal as it was central to most of our activities and with very little street noise. The walk to Times Square is short as is the walk to major shopping.Some of the furniture did look a little worn but considering the the space you get get for such a reasonable price in NYC, it was perfectly fine. I was very pleased with our stay at the Kimberly and would highly recommend it, especially to those on a budget and with children.We will definitely stay at the Kimberly Hotel again!

<Content>For the amountof space no complaints! I booked into The Kimberly the week after Thanksgiving for 5 nights after reading reviews here. Got a nice deal thru a web reservation service. The lobby was much smaller that I anticipated, but who spends time in the lobby? The room was VERY spacious by NYC standards. Had freinds staying around the corner, The W, and I visited their room.....TINY. They actually ended up staying an extra night in my room as I had the pull out sofa in the living room. I really like the balcony. It is nice to be able to walk outside and check the weather! The staff was very freindly, esp housekeeping! The receptionist tried to upgrade me to one of the premier suites but didn't have one for all 5 nights. The steak house adjacant served a good meal, but I would have appreciated better service at midnight with only 4 other tables in the place. They serve until 2am. I would stay here again at a discounted rate. Their published rates are much too high for the calibur of the property.

<Content>It is what it is.... Spent a long week there for business. The room was spacious with a full kitchen and sitting room It was clean and the bed was soft but comfortable. The work space provided was very small and the lighting was poor. I felt like I was checking my email in the dark most afternoons. It feels like an older apartment inside. The staff was nice and helpfull with several requests I made. One downside, one of the elevators broke and the on that was left was very slow. I walked down 12 floors to go out to dinner...happy that I wasn't on the 30th or having to walkup. It was fixed that night so it must have just been something small.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We stayed at The Kimberly Hotel, 145 E 50th Street, New York for a total of 6 nights in November and would recommend it to anyone for it's location, friendly staff, size of suites and comfort value. Perhaps not the cheapest of hotels but we could not fault it in any way. Suite had everything - large bedrooms with oh so comfortable beds, great living area and kitchen, spacious bathrooms with every comfort, everything spotlessly clean and the added bonus of a balcony with the breathtaking view of the Chrysler Building.It doesn't get much better than this.We wouldn't stay anywhere else now when we visit New York.

<Content>Best service, best value in Midtown I stayed at the Kimberly for the first time this week and at every turn, was suprised and delighted by the unparalleled service and amenities they provided during my stay -- from the complimentary upgrade to a suite, to the personalized note and free gift from the manager (completely unexpected), to the extremely attentive staff and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in outside of my home! All this for less than $300/night? That's unheard of for Midtown. Plus, the location cannot be beat -- it's 1/2 block from the Waldorf-Astoria. I LOVED this hotel and will definitely be back!

<Content>Great Location and Room I have stayed at and complained about many touted 4.5 and 5 star resorts. It is rare, therefore, that I would fully endorse any accommodation. However, staying at the Kimberly made my family and my first trip to New York a truly wonderful experience. The room was spacious, clean and well decorated. The only drawback was the less than friendly employee on duty for customer service. On the other hand the rest of the staff were so great that her less than helpful disposition seem so contrasting.

<Content>Suite Dreams The Kimberly has an excellent location, terrific staff and extremely spacious suites in a city where visitors regularly pay over $300 for tiny box-sized rooms. But, unless you are staying in one of the top-priced suites, the Chrysler, Ambassador or Empire, don't expect to be utterly thrilled. Our 1-bedroom suite was roomy and well-appointed with large windows in both bedroom and living room (with balcony), but they hardly mattered, as they looked out onto a dingy blue building directly across and down to heating vents and compressors. This meant the room stayed dark even though we had sunny weather during our 3-night stay. The upside of being on this side, was that the drone of the equipment below was perhaps preferable to NYC street noise, even on the 15th floor. As mentioned in other reviews, furnishings are somewhat dated; my husband thought the lamps were particularly ugly, however everything was clean and in working order. Two terry robes were provided, one TV in each room, a CD player in the bedroom, full bath with Neutrogena toiletries, lots of closet space and drawers, extra towels and pillows, a well-equipped kitchen, comfortable bed with good linens and down duvet, big couch, soft chairs, dining table and chairs, desk with fax machine and in-room wireless or ethernet-cabled high-speed Internet, - on the whole better than many a working New Yorker's apartment. Like anywhere, your impression of The Kimberly will depend on your expectations. I had a good idea of what I was getting into from reading many of the other reviews, both favorable and not. We left feeling satisfied with The Kimberly, but somehow it did not earn our affection as a favorite hotel. As long as it remains competitive price-wise however, it will be a contender for future stays.

<Content>Superior service  We do not normally write and express our views but we had such a great week at the Kimberly that we felt it necessary. We knew the location was good having stayed at the Waldorf the previous year but the service at the Kimberly was far superior. The staff were always pleased to see you and provide assistance. On entering the lobby Gregory always greeted you with a beaming smile and made you feel welcome.The one bedroom suite was just as expected, very clean and spacious. It was a haven to be able to return put your feet up and have a hot drink whenever you liked from the comlimentary filter coffee or tea.The small kitchen was well fitted with gas hob/oven, microwave, fridge/freezer, toaster, coffee machine and there was even a dishwasher!It was great to be able to get to all parts of Manhattan quickly from the nearby metro lines and Fifth Avenue and Central Park only a few blocks away.We didn't expect to receive such a personal service but that is exactly what we got. Congratulations to the Manager and all the staff.

<Content>Every year Unless you just want to pay for over the top luxury, why stay anywhere else? The Kimberly is part of why we love NYC. Great staff. Great rooms. Great location. Can't wait for next year, it'll be our fifth year in a row at the Kimberly.

<Content>Kudos for the Kimberly I stayed at the Kimberly for two nights recently with a friend. I requested an updated room on a higher floor and they accommodated my request. When I asked if we could be upgraded, I was told that for an additional $30 they could give us a one bedroom suite. We declined to spend more but were very impressed with our accommodations. The beds are just heavenly and all those pillows!! The room was more like a personal bedroom than a hotel room. It was nice to have a refrigerator too.I had stayed at the Kimberly once before and had an executive suite which had plasma tv's on the walls...the deluxe guestroom had a small, older tv, but it was fine. The price was really good compared to just about everything else in the midtown east area. We were very satisfied with the room and with the service. The bellman and doorman are very friendly and make you feel like you are coming home each day. I would recommend the Kimberly, but ask for an updated room as there seems to be some people who had more inferior rooms.

<Content>Wonderful experience I stayed at The Kimberly for only one night on a business trip in April 05. I loved it... The down comforter was amazing!!! They had a great supply of all newspapers available in the lobby for free. I was in a small suite and loved it - tons of space and soo comfortable.I am planning another business trip and while curious about other hotels I am seriously considering The Kimberly again.

<Content>I LOVE this hotel! We spent 3 nights here end of August. It was PERFECT with our toddler son -- he slept in the living room and we had the bedroom and bathroom. All BIG rooms -- so unusual for NYC. It was great having a kitchen -- especially with all the good deli's and convenience stores nearby. We would come back from walking all over the city and relax with milk for the toddler, and drinks for us. In general, it was one of our favorite locations -- near Rockefeller Center and Time Square and short walk to the Park. And a nice residential feel with small cafes just a block over on 2nd. Our bed was fabulous with soft pillow top and awesome linens -- better than any Westin Heavenly bed I have slept in. The shower was good, and with our inside location we had NO street noise -- it was soo quiet. The staff was nice, although not terribly well informed. But, with wireless connections in the rooms, you can just look stuff up online anyway.

<Content>Fantastic hotel! My wife spent days researching hotels online and we decided to try this one. We are very glad we did. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay August 28 through September 1. The beautiful suite was very clean and nicely appointed. The staff was very helpful and extremely friendly. The kitchen came in handy for breakfasts and the pillow top bed was very comfortable. Our daughter spent a couple of nights and slept in the sofa bed. We will definitely return to this lovely hotel.

<Content>The Kimberly is Great We just returned from a six night trip to NYC. We stayed at The Kimberly all six nights and enjoyed ourselves. My husband, 18 year old daughter and I were in a one bedroom suite on the 29th floor so we were quite removed from street noise. We felt like The Kimberly was a home away from home and a welcome respite whenever we returned, exhausted, from sight seeing. The major drawback was the sofa bed in the living room. It had springs poking through and had a huge sag in the middle. After one night, we called the front desk to see if they could offer a complimentary rollaway. They accomodated us graciously and we were not charged for it's use.Several times during our stay, we were asked by the staff if we were enjoying ourselves and that they were honored to have us as their guests. We felt welcomed by the staff and would stay at The Kimberly again. The price for a one bedroom was much better than most regular hotel rooms and it gave us some much neded space. Great location too. The other thing we liked, was the relative small size of the hotel. It allowed for much more personal service. We never had to wait in a line for a cab and we always got one almost immediately. All in all, we had great service and a wonderful time in New York.

<Content>Good location / tidy rooms To use an over used football ( Soccer for our American cousins) cliche' this hotel review is a game of two halves....We came to the big apple as part of our extended 2005 holiday to the states, part of which was a long weekend in NY, we had searched around for a sensible Manhattan hotel for our family of four,two adults and two teenagers, the KIMBERLY seemed just perfect and so we booked a four night stay commencing Thursday 4th Aug. We made it very clear that we wanted a one bedroom suite with two double beds in it.Now for the negative bit.Although the check in and conceierge staff were great, we found that our room was one with only a single double bed and a pull out bed in the lounge, we went to the room and it had a fabulous view of both the East river bridghe and the Chrysler building so we decided to give it a go.The pull out bed was perhaps the worst bed i have ever slept in !, so we asked to be moved the next day or at worst given a double matress to put over the very thin matress on the pull out.What then followed can only be described as Pythonesque, with a varity of various beds and matress's all turning up none of which were suitable.EVENTUALLY they did agree to move us to another room once it bacame available.Now the positive bit.They moved us lock stock and barrell with the minimum of fuss on our part, to another room with two double beds.WHAT A DIFFERENCE......the room was clean and spacious, the decor was a little dated, but the little kitchenette was very usefull.The reception staff were very helpfull, and the location is great, we walked 15 mins south to the Empire State building and 10 mins north to Central parkOverall we would return, my only advice being that if there are four of you ensure that they GUARANTEE you a two double bedded suite and you could not go far wrong !

<Content>Disappointed My family of four has just returned from New York and spent two nights at the Kimberly Hotel. Had we planned to stay longer or had it only been my husband I, we would have left and moved up the street to the Waldorf or the Palace; however we had two chldren with us and the Kimberly, formerly an apartment building, had two room suites, an ideal set-up for families. The good news: the Kimberly's one bedroom suite was good sized; did have a balcony, a kitchen and is in a convenient mid-town location.The negatives began at arrival. My children and arrived on an early flight knowing that our room would not be ready for several hours. We were prepared for this. I asked for a time to return and was told 1:00 P.M. Shortly before 2:00 P.M. we arrived back and when I inquired about the status of our room, was told it was not ready. Again, asking when we might return, I was told in a very terse voice to come back in a half hour. We did and this time without dierctly responding to my question, the clerk said give them room 21D. At no time during these exchanges did this man engage in more than the necessary words to convey the information regarding a room. Arriving at our room, I thought I had thought I had walked into my great-aunt's apartment which had not seen an update in 20 or more years. The lighting was so bad (yellow tinge to everything) that even with all the lights on, it was difficult to read. The lamps, ceiling and wall lamps were either left over from the hotel conversion or were an attempt at vintage lighting. Whatever the case, the effect was drab and dreary. When I attempted to turn the lamp on next to the bed, I noticed the light socket was out of the lamp. Calling the front desk, I began to inquire about a replacement lamp and the phone clicked in my ear as I was speaking. Calling back again, a gentleman came up, put the socket back in the lamp and told me I could operate it from the wall and not to use the manual switch.The wallpaper border was peeling off from the wall, the carpet was more than just a little old and dated but also stained. The furniture was a 1970s fake french provincial; the bathtub had part of the faucet hanging off and worst of all an alleged non-smoking room had a definite smell of smoke which apparently the management encourages as there were ashtrays in the drawers. All in all it was a drab and dreary place to spend a couple of nights not to mention the headache from the cigarette smell.We are not high maintenance travelers; however, we do expect some basic level of service from a hotel. When my husband arrived in the afternoon and asked for a key to the room, he had to ask the woman at the desk if she wanted to see his I.D. And perhaps it was the treatment by the desk staff that seemed to leave such a poor impression of the hotel. At no time, at check in or check out, did anyone ask if there was anythng they could do for us or gave us the usual have a nice time in ..... and if there is anything we can do for you recitation. The two times I called the front desk regarding the lamp issue, I was not greeted by name (even the Holiday Inn Express answers Hello Ms...... When I checked out, the woman at the front desk did not ask me if we enjoyed our stay, either at the Kimberly (no) or in New York (yes). The coincierge was so busy on the telephone talking to whomever that it took a half hour to arrange for a car to take us back to the airport. Thank goodness we didn't need help with tickets or information as to where to go or how to get around.My last stay in New York was at the Plaza. Even as that grand hotel was closing (and was quite shabby itself in its last days) and the staff was aware of their imminent unemployment, they remained professional, courteous and very friendly. The Kimberly might want to pick up someone from the Plaza and find out how to make guests feel good about staying at a worn out hotel. The next time we need two rooms in New York, we will head up the street to the Benjamin.

<Content>Kimberly OK place to stay Our family of 4 stayed at the Kimberly for 5 nights in August. The hotel is older, but very clean. The King in the master is very comfortable. I loved the down feather bed and the down comforter. The pull out couch mattress was too uncomfortable for even my 100 pound daughter, so she just slept directly on the couch. My son slept on the roll away which was fine. The furnishings were fine, having two tv's was nice, although they are old and small. The location was really great. Close to shopping and dining. Upon check in I tried to upgrade to a larger room with an extra bathroom and although they had it available, one person told me it would be an extra $150 per night and the next day I asked someone new and he said it would be an extra $200 per night. My feeling is that we are staying for 5 nights, so why not be gracious if it was available. Also, I had requested a renovated room, but was told none were available. I did chat with others who were able to get them on the 22nd and 23rd floor.My two biggest complaints are 1) the bathroom was too small and 2) The air conditioning. Because it is an older unit it goes on and off all night long and it is loud, so it definately interrupted our sleep.We did have one bad experience with the concierge. We told him we wanted two Met鈥檚 tickets for a Wednesday night. He found them for us at a Sporting goods store a couple of blocks away. We went over there, purchased the tickets and went to the game. When we got to the game, we were told the tickets were for the night before. We spent $70 on the first set of tickets and then $100 at the door so we could see the game. It was a bummer. The only other thing is that I left behind my digital camera and no one seems to have found it. Hmmmm.All in all a fine place to stay.

<Content>Kimberly-Good place to stay Just spent a weekend at the Kimberly, 50th betw. Lex  3rd. We had 7 people in the group so we splurged a little and got one 2 BR/2 bath suite and one 1BR/1bath suite. Rooms were nice, roomy, kitchenettes in each. Nice view from the walk out patio on the 30th floor. We went with the suites beause it would have cost similar to have 3-4 rooms at a standard hotel. Kimberly is an older property, so there are a few imperfections, but all in all I'd stay there again. Staff is nice  helpful.

<Content>We loved this place!!!!!!! We pulled up in our rental car around noon, planning to stash our bags and hit the streets, as we did not expect our room would be ready. Not so! Not only were we allowed to check in early, they held the rental car at the curb while we settled in to our 2bdrm suite on the 25th floor. The suite was unbelievably spacious, especially for New York, with a nice kitchenette, living room and dining area. We had a lovely view of the Chrysler building and the East River. The beds were so comfortable (and HUGE) with high quality linens, featherbed and tons of down pillows. I am a pillow fanatic. I never travel without my own pillow, but next time I go to the Kimberly, I will leave my pillows home! The hotel staff was the best! Everyone was extremely friendly and helpfully. Our teenage kids loved being able to check their email in the complimentary business center. The common areas of the hotel were small, but who wants to hang out in their hotel in NYC? In fact, that was the only downside of this hotel. Our room was so nice, I would have wanted to spend more time in it, but I also wanted to see the sights. The location of the Kimberly is great for that! It's East-side, Mid-town location made it an easy walk to so many of NYC's great attractions. The rest were easy access by subway, with a stop only one block away. And for all this, we paid less than we would have for 2 regular hotel rooms anywhere else.

<Content>Excellent choice, excellent location. My family of four enjoyed a great four nights at the Kimberly from July 4th thru July 8th. We were located in a one bedroom suite that gave us plenty of room to spread out especially with a 17 and 19 year old. We really took advantage of the fully equiped kitchen for breakfast each day. The Kimberly staff was tremendous, and service was first rate. The smaller scale of this hotel was 'just right' for us. Location was quite good since most of the midtown sites were no more than a 10-15 minute walk away, and a subway stop at 51st and Lexington or Grand Central got you to anywhere else. We would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Summer in the City! Stayed for one night at the Kimberly. Had an executive King suite with a balcony overlooking 50th. The great room was really large with a kitchenette and comfy sofa (a little worn). The bedroom had a great bed with featherbed and down comforter and tons of pillows. The sheets were high quality as well. The bathroom was old and a little small but clean and good shower pressure. The staff was exceptionally nice and took great care of us. We used the concierge extensively and she did a great job. I highly reccommend the NYHRC cruise - pretty casual, edible food, cheap price and the best (albeit expensive) long-island Iced Tea I've ever had.The only reason I don't give it a 5 is that I paid ~$525, for one night including room service breakfast (very overpriced and not very good) so I don't think it was a great value. But I enjoyed it anyway!

<Content>Stayed at the Kimberly June 24-27 I had a confirmed reservation made two months before arriving for a 2 bedr, 2 bath suite - upon arrival was told I was being upgraded to a 3 bedr suite - how nice! Only problem was 3 bedr had no living room and no full kitchen and we needed those rooms for our group of 6. They moved us to 2 one bedr suites across the hall from each other - beds were comfortable, pull out sofa not comfortable - you could feel the springs - good location, nice doormen, and I would ask for terrace with a view - our first 3 bedr upgrade had a beat up looking terrace and looked into another bulding - depressing - other than the reservation being not what I wanted we all said we'd stay again -

<Content>Huge room for New York, and most comfortable bed EVER! After a recommendation and lots of research, we chose The Kimberly for a short stop off in New York this past May. The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating and allowed us to check in early at 10am as we arrived fresh off a red eye from San Francisco, California. The hotel's common space is on the smaller size since this is a boutique hotel, but the one bedroom suite we stayed in more than made up for that! There is a nice sized kitchen complete w/ stove, oven, dishwasher, and refridgerator, spacious living room area w/ a sofa and television, and large bedroom, esp for New York. The bed had to have been at least a King (if not Cal. King) and was THE MOST comfortable bed I have ever slept in at a hotel. Crisp linens, plenty of pillows, and a high quality feather bed to top if off!! Room was quiet except for some morning traffic noise that filtered in. Only complaint is the bathroom is small and some of the decor was a bit dated and tired (hence the above average rating), but the hotel's prime location, room size, bed, and overall price is unbeatable. Also, many discount sites offer lower rates for this hotel. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Loved it-want to go back! My husband and daughter and I stayed four nights at the Kimberly and absolutely loved it. I usually book much less expensive hotels but wanted to enjoy NYC at its best. The hotel was excellent and comfortable without being overly fussy. The location was great and we walked to nearly everything. I don't get the opportunity to stay at higher end hotels much but this rated only 1 step below the Grand Hotel in Oslo Norway for me.

<Content>Charming Place My parents and I stayed at the Kimberly this past weekend. We were in the City for overnight to attend a family wedding. We took a chance on the hotel because of its location and price. From the minute we pulled up curbside until we got in our car, the treatment was outstanding. We had a room with two beds , beds I might add I wish I could have taken home and so many pillows! We had stayed previously at another boutique hotel midtown that we found on the internet and were very disappointed. Not so with the Kimberly! The only drawback was that my mother, who is not so young anymore could not use the bathtub/shower as it was too high for her to get into. There was a great brunch offer for hotel guests which we unfortunately did not have time for, but there was a great luncheonette next door and plenty of choices for dining if we were there longer.Would definately stay again.

<Content>Not bad, but still overpriced Stayed at the Kimberly Hotel in Manhattan in June 2005. Not bad, but still too small for the price. First night, hot water handle broke, so we could not shower that night. But repairman came first thing in morning. Cable went out for about six hours. Relatively clean but carpet could be replaced. Convenient location (I guess that's why the price is so high). Personnel were friendly and helpful. Doorman was always pleasant. Whatever you do, don't eat at O'Neills in the lobby (unless money is no object). WAY OVERPRICED! Millions of other places locally to chow down that are much cheaper and good.Would recommend, but reserve far in advance. Prices skyrocket as your date gets closer, especially in summer.

<Content>Very pleased with the Kimberly My cousin and I stayed 6 nights at the Kimberly in a 1 bedroom on the 26th floor. The beds were wonderful, the best I've found in New York - including The Plaza. The furniture was a bit worn, but fine. The room was very quiet and the balcony was an added plus.The door staff was friendly and helpful and the hotel was in a good location near the subway and many great restaurants.I will definately stay at The Kimberly again.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! The Kimberly is truly my favorite hotel in NYC!!!! The one bedroom suite I requested was perfect, with a great added touch, a private balcony with a view of the city. The beds and bathroom were very nice, as well as the staff, who were all very helpful and friendly! The FREE Internet kiosk off the hotel lobby is also an awesome feature. The location is also with in walking distance of several midtown attractions and the shopping on 5th. Ave. ! The concierge recommended MAMA MEXICO, a fabulous mexican restaurant just down the street from the hotel for dinner one night, and it was truly amazing!!! I love this hotel and hope to return ASAP!!!

<Content>Will definitely go back. Excellent hotel staff, service and location. The two bedroom suite was perfect for our group, although not inexpensive. We loved having a balcony to got some fresh air, and a full kitchen was very nice. The decor is somewhat tired. However, the beds were the most comforable I've ever encountered in a hotel (and I've stayed at several Westins). Clean and a good value. Great luncheonette next door, Starbucks, McDonalds and a great bagel place right around the corner.

<Content>Has to be the best kept secret in nyc, superb From the moment we arrived at the front door and was greeted by the wonderful staff our incredible experience began. My self and three of my friends (all girls) stayed for 3 nights May 26- May 28, we never felt crowded at all in the very spacious rooms. Very clean, beds wonderful, bath was fine even for 4 ladies trying to get ready. We definitely will be back to the Kimberly, we recommend it to everyone. Good bye Waldorf Astoria, the kimberly is our new home away from home.

<Content>Great all-around hotel! The Kimberly hotel was an excellent experience. We were on a bachelorette/girls weekend and the hotel staff did everything from making dinner reservations to coming to our room to take a group photo of us on the balcony. They were extremely polite, the beds were wonderful, great location and price! I would definitley recommend this hotel!

<Content>A great hotel in a great location Just got back from NYC and spend 3 nights at the Kimberly. We were most impressed. Good rooms with great space and fantastic beds.Location is great. We ate at O'Neills the steakhouse joined to the hotel (they also serve breakfast). I had the best steak I have eaten in years and superb service. I would highly commend both the hotel and restaurant. As and earlier reviewer mentions, if you are looking for modern chic this is not the place as it is a very traditional hotel. All in all a great place and one of the biggest suite we have had in any hotel. They also have access to a local gym and health club which was a nice bonus.

<Content>Highly recommended We stayed at the Kimberly for 6 nights in April and we would recommend it to anyone. It was convenient for subway, bus routes, 5th Avenue shops and Central Park. The staff were incredibly friendly and very helpful. We had a suite which had a sofa bed in the lounge area and two very comfortable double beds in the bedroom. Also two TVs and unexpectedly well equipped kitchen complete with dishwasher, microwave, oven and kettle! We also had a balcony - nice to get fresh air in the mornings.Our only complaint was that the sofa bed was a bit lumpy and, to be really picky, the bathroom was a little small. The decor is very traditional - if you want chic and modern this is not for you. However, it was clean and very comfortable.Ask for a room as high as possible - more light and better views. Also rooms at the back of the hotel avoided the street noise.

<Content>lots of room, great location stayed over spring break '05 - book with the hotel direct to be sure of room type - good front desk and concierge - excellent housekeeping staff - linens were great. Best thing was the amount of space in the suite! 3 in the family means we loved the extra room. Good moderate price cafe next door! Central location close to the Waldorf means easy access to Rockefeller Center and Times Square is a 10 min. walk. Undergoing rooms renovation. Needed. Service makes up for it. Would recommend.

<Content>Everything I expected Just stayed 5 nights at the Kimberly with my wife and 2 young teens during spring break. The hotel was everything it was cracked up to be in the recent reviews. Location was perfect for a family vacation. I would not recommend staying in Time Square which is too hectic and noisy and does not feel as safe. The staff was overly courteous the entire time. The 1 BR suite was more than adequate and had plenty of room even with a rollaway bed (no extra charge.) As others have stated, the bathroom is a little small but not a problem. Did not eat breakfast at the hotel but excellent and reasonable breakfast could be had around the corner at Essa Bagel or the Metro. The bed was very comfortable and had a nice down comforter and pillow top. Only negative was that the bedroom door did not have a lock which took away some of the privacy factor...oh, well. Would definitely go back next time.

<Content>My Honeymoon was wonderful!!! I love The Kimberly Hotel!!! My new husband and I spend the week there for our honeymoon in March 2005. Every employee was so friendly and really made us feel special. The hotel is in the best location... walking distance from many of the best New York sites. We were in the one bedroom suite and it was so roomy... we spent a few days just in the room and it never felt crowded. The balcony was a nice touch, too. Best in New York for the price.

<Content>Great weekend at the Kimberly We just returned from a trip to New York where we stayed at the Kimberly. The service was tremendous. The doorman was the best we have ever had. The lobby was clean, the elevators were small, and the rooms were clean. We stayed in a one bedroom suite and although it was clean there were some improvements that could be made. When you turned on the lights, you could see what appeared to be burn marks from the light bulbs, also there was a picture on the wall and the frame was coming apart. Everything was within walking distance. We ate breakfast at the restaurant and it was ok. We went back to the restaurant for desert and coffee and as we were eating my wife spotted a mouse near the front of the place, the waiter acted surprised and then came back and said did it leave yet, like it was a joke or it happend all the time. I would not recommed the place. The best restaurant we ate at was St. Andrews on West 46th street the steak and chicken dishes were spectacular and the price was right on. Can't wait to go back.

<Content>Can't wait to go back! Just got back form a 4 night stay at the Kimberly. The location of the Kimberly is great! Just a quick walk to Rockefeller Center and St. Patricks. Within walking distance to Times Square and ESB. We felt extremely safe in the location. The resturant (George O'neils) has a $10.00 breakfast buffet that is great! The room was huge! It had a full kitchen stocked with everything. The decor was a little dated, but everything was clean. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I will stay at the Kimberly the next time I get to New York!

<Content>Fantastic place to stay! We have just come back from a 3 night break in New York with our 3 year old son having had a fantastic time. We booked at the Kimberly Hotel last minute when an appartment company let us down... and we were so glad that we ended up here! The location is great, staff couldn't have been more helpful (suggesting child-friendly restaurants etc). Suites were very roomy and well furnished - beds were amazingly comfy!(although we overlooked the air-conditioning units at the back of the adjacent hotel). The breakfast at the adjoining restaurant was a bargain $10 buffet and they didn't charge for our son! We will definitely be staying here again. (More comfortable and better value than the Waldorf Astoria where we stayed last time!)

<Content>Great hotel, great location A+++ Stayed at The Kimberly Feb. 26-28th and was very pleased with our choice. I booked it because of the reviews I read on Trip advisor and everything was right on. The location was perfect ,close to walk to the 5 th Ave. stores and the play we saw on Broadway.The beds are so unbeleivably comfortable I am buying a feather bed for myself.We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite that was really big and had a nice kitchen and a balcony! It was very clean. I would highly recommend having the breakfast buffet in the connected O'neils Restaurant for $10.00.Omlets to order, carmelized french toast, carved ham etc... it was wonderful as was the price.I can't beleive the price of the rooms, for New York you can't beat the value and the quality.

<Content>Can I move in? The staff and rooms are soo wonderful. This mostly suites property provide clean very spacious rooms at extremely affordable rates. A rarety for NYC.   Conveniently located in midtown, the staff make you feel like you're at your 2nd home. Little things like remembering your name, turn down service, craftmatic beds (not in all rooms), balcony, too many benefits to list.  Can't wait to come back!

<Content>What a gem!!! My husband and I stayed at the Kimberly from Dec. 12-15 and were delighted with the room we were assigned. We did not have a suite, and I wasn't sure what to expect as far as room size, since so many posts talk about the small rooms in NYC. What a pleasant surprise to find our lovely, large, spotlessly clean room! The staff were all pleasant, helpful, and friendly. There is a subway station just one block away (or less), and the Manhattan Cafe next door was a great place for a filling, delicious, inexpensive breakfast. We did a lot of walking, day and night, and always felt completely safe walking to the Kimberly, even though it is 2 or 3 of the long blocks from the 5th Ave. area. My husband and I agree that we have never slept on a more comfortable bed--anywhere! He even removed part of the bedding trying to find the brand name!! The robes were plush and comfortable--and meant one less thing to pack! We were not on a very high floor, but if there was any road noise, we didn't hear it. Our only complaint might have been a rather loud band playing somewhere one night---but before we could think about complaining to the desk, that comfortable bed just put us right to sleep! We would certainly stay here on future visits, and highly recommend the Kimberly to everyone.

<Content>It was the best We stayed here for 6 nights including Christmas Eve. I don't think there is any comparable hotel suite this size at this price. We found almost everything to be top notch. I am astonished at the negative reviews and can't help thinking that the hotel must have since then undergone some renovations and/or upgrades at least to the 2 bedroom I stayed in (28B). I found it elegant and beautiful. The furnishings aren't meant to be modern and they were certainly not outdated. Since we were there during the winter, we didn't get much chance to use the balcony but what an added benefit. It is obvious that the Kimberly was once an apartment building as our suite was the size of a NY apartment, far larger than the ordinary (and even expensive) hotel room. While the bathrooms may not be marble, they are spacious enough and nicely appointed. The towels and bathrobes are plush. Unlike one review said, I found the lobby to be very beautiful and beautifully decorated for the holidays. And there wasn't a time when a doorman or two wasn't there to help with the revolving door and to hold the elevator. There is a full time concierge available to arrange for your every need. I will agree with one review that the kitchen is not well supplied for cooking. There is a medium size frig, a small oven and range and microwave and coffeepot. There is a basic set of pots, silverware, glasses and dishes. But no baking pans, mixing bowls, or microwave dishes. So don't plan on doing a lot of cooking. All of the staff are extremely delightful and friendly. I felt like it was a home away from home and would highly recommend this hotel to everyone.

If I have to say anything I would have changed it would have been to stay on a higher floor. The only view we had was into a building next door! The Kimberly will be my home away home anytime I am in the city!

<Content>Good experience overall with the Kimberly My wife and I and our son, age 13, stayed in a 1 BR, 1 bath suite at the Kimberly October 23 for one night.The hotel location was great for us: We were in NYC visiting relatives in Yorkville (Upper East Side), and the entrance to the Lexington Ave. subway was just a block from the Kimberly.The suite was spacious, and the furnishings, though more formal than we're used to, we're fine. The bathroom was small but not intolerably so. We used the kitchen only for coffee, but would have used it more had we stayed longer.We drove to the hotel. The bell captain on duty promptly and attentively handled our valet parking. The next morning after checking out we left our luggage in the bell captain's care so we could window shop before reclaiming our car. This arrangement went off without a hitch.One problem: Our suite was awfully warm. The heating/cooling controls seemed useless. We kept the room comfortable only by opening the windows and the balcony door.The $10 breakfast buffet at George O'Neill's is a great deal. The service was only fair though.

<Content>Great location, comfy beds, dated decor Found the Kimberly via this website and couldn't believe the good things written about it. We (two moms, 3 kids) spent 3 nights in October, and found the 2 bedroom, 2 bath suite accommodations more than adequate. While the furnishings were quite dated and needed replacement, the beds were fabulously comfortable with their featherbeds over the mattresses. The 2nd bedroom was small, but adequate as we were here to sightsee, not spend time in the room. The master bedroom was quite spacious. George O'Neill's is as stated by others - the best bargain to be found!! Huge, beautifully displayed and delicious buffet with carving station, made-to-order eggs, etc. If I lived anywhere in the area, I'd eat there every day - you can't buy groceries for the cost of what they serve!If you're looking for finely appointed accommodations, our suite wouldn't fit the bill. But it was clean, well-priced, spacious (except for the bathrooms) and very convenient for all of our sightseeing activities.

<Content>fine value for a suite, but not as good as I expected We stayed here just this past weekend. Our 1-bedroom suite with terrace was airy (I loved being able to open the windows), quite clean  well-maintained (e.g., no stains on the carpet), had great storage/closet space (there was even an umbrella for our use in the foyer closet). The bathrooms, however, are not full marble as you might expect from their website, (the walls are only partially clad in marble tile); the lobby is ho-hum  provides almost no seating space for those waiting; and our suite's kitchen was not as well equipped with serving/cooking pieces  utensils as the typical Residence Inn. The furnishings are not high-end, but attractive enough; the lighting is excellent; there was a fax/printer/copier atop the desk; and our bed was exceptionally comfortable.The Kimberly's level of service was appreciably lower than we were expecting based on recent reviews here. No doorman or bellhop greeted us upon arrival; we had to ask the front desk clerk if one was available, and when he appeared, he appeared to be only half-awake  was still struggling to get his uniform jacket buttoned. The $10 breakfast buffet is a terrific deal, especially in Manhattan, and the omelet chef was personable; the wait staff was not attentive, e.g., we never did get the coffee creamer we asked for twice. And check-out was inordinately tedious: front-desk operations are not fully computerized, and they couldn't find our paper billings  kept on looking for our folder long past the time when I would have apologized and re-opened the account.I'm willing to believe that the service we experienced was below their norm. But even so, I would say that if having a suite is not important to you, there are better choices available in the same (or lower ) price range. such as the Iroquois.

<Content>Kimberly Hotel - Fantastic! We spent a week in mid-October at the Kimberly in a one-bedroom suite. The staff was very accomodating and gave us a corner suite with a terrific balcony view on the 26th floor at check in (yes, we had requested a view and high up). We loved our room! It was sparkling clean, plenty of closet space, well-appointed kitchen, living room with big balcony and great view, great feather bed, and marble bathroom with lots of storage. The attached restaurant, George O'Neill's is a steak house, but offers a huge $10 buffet breakfast. Consequently, we hardly used our kitchen. This is in a great midtown location and is just around the corner from two different subway lines.

<Content>Great for Families I stayed at the Kimberly Oct 8-10. The one bedroom suite was large, comfortable and clean. I loved the balcony. The bed was very comfy. My kids slept on the pull out couch and had their own TV . It was nice to have the extra space. The bathroom is small but it has lots of storage space and a lighted make up mirror. The staff was friendly and professional.The hotel restaurant George O'Neils had a nice breakfast with a piano player. I look forward to my next stay at the Kimberly.

<Content>Great Hotel Went to New York to set my son up for Culinary studies and so after researching the net for over 6 months and comparing hotels I settled upon The Kimberly. Very glad I did. Centrally located to alot of what you go to New York to see. The staff (everyone included) made our stay most enjoyable. We were there for 12 days. I got to know several of the employees by name and they knew me and my family by name. The staff at the adjoining restaraunt George O'Neills was just as friendly. The service was great and the food excellent and they have a staff that they should be proud of - as I know they are. Loved the outside cafe. Thank you Vince for putting up with me just sitting outside soaking up the city and people watching. The conceirge staff at the Kimberly were very helpful in anything that I inquired about and very knowledgeable. The suite was good size and very clean and the noise level was hardly noticable. Slept like a baby. I was very impressed. Would I recommend this hotel to anyone - YOU BET. Thank all of you for the help, directions, watching over me, the ideas and most of all good service and great food. Will be going back in March and hope to see everyone again. - till then - the Matthews family.

<Content>Excellent hotel My husband and 18 year old son and I stayed at the Kimberly 1-4 September 2004 and we had a great time. What a great asset the doormen Gregory and Jose are - always smiling and helping out - I would go back just to see them at work again!The one bedroom suite was clean and roomy(the king size bed had the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in) and the hotel is in an excellent location - within walking distance of most places but also near the subway.The 3 hour boat trip was very good - what a fantasic way to see New York in the evening. We would recommend this hotel to anyone and hope to go back one day.

<Content>Kimberly is great! We stayed at The Kimberly from July 31st to Aug 8th 2004. The suite was great, with enough room for all four of us. My two sixteen year old girls found the sofa bed quite comfy and plenty roomy enough. The bathroom is small but spotlessly clean.All the staff were very friendly and helpful, but a special mention has to go to Greg, the doorman, whose welcoming smile was a pleasure to come home to after a long day of sightseeing. Don't bother looking for any other hotel!

<Content>wonderful choice! Surprised my husband with a birthday weekend in NY. Chose the kimberly from user reviews and a great deal at hotels. It exceeded expectations - the spaciousness, the balcony, the staff. Some of the perks include passes to NY Health  Racquet club a couple of blocks away with a great pool/sauna/whirlpool. for working off that fabulous breakfast buffet). Several subway lines and the crosstown busses on 49/50 make this very convenient for low cost getting about. If you need a cab, just call down ahead and concierge will arrange it - they were always more than willing to help - for ex. our smoke alarm battery was beeping, maint. was there in less than 5 minutes.If your looking for space, cleanliness and a smile, (without needing luxe in furnishings) visit the Kimberly...... Couldn't figure out The Vue next door - is it a nightclub, bar, restaurant - ??? Doorman/bouncers looked ominous.

<Content>Wonderful Stay We had a wonderful stay at the Kimberley Suites Hotel. Our room was spacious and very clean. It was great to have a bedroom separate from the kids and a kitchen (although we didn't use it). The staff was kind and helpful and the ajoining restraunt had a fabulous buffet breakfast for only $10. We were there for pleasure for only 2 nights but I can certainly see staying here on an extended stay for business (or pleasure, if Manhattan's your thing). The ONLY down fall was that it was very difficult to get a cab in the rain, so leave early if you have a curtain or reservation to make.

<Content>Great for families Stayed 5 days and couldn't have been happier! Rained one full day of our vacation but the spacious living area and kitchen felt more like home watching TV than stuck in a hotel room. The balcony was a great bonus! Bathroom was rather small but the rest of the amenities made up for it. Clean, good price for the area, great location and very friendly staff. Will stay there again.

<Content>My Favorite New York Hotel! I loved this hotel! It is far superior to better known hotels in the area. The value much exceeds the reasonable price. The hotel is quiet (for Manhattan), my suite was very nicely furnished, large and luxurious. The high speed internet connection and laptop-sized room safe were a great advantage. I was quite pleased with everyone I met on the hotel staff. This is a small, boutique hotel (by New York standards), and with a living room and kitchen, I felt that I could come home at night more than anywhere else I've ever stayed in New York. There was simply not one negative thing I saw in a four-night stay at this very lovely hotel, and I have only good things to say about it. A rare treasure!

<Content>Excellent condo hotel Well maintained hotel coverted from former condo building.Understand it was rehabed completed within past 4 years.Very comfortble, amenities good. All come with small kitchen and dining areas, high speed internet lines, etc. In upper east side of Midtown, one block to east side subway lines. Rates are reasonable for NYC, but get far better prices from hotel websites as hotel just refuses to deal.

<Content>Loved The Kimberly We stayed at The Kimberly May 13-16 and from the time we arrived we were treated great. The entire staff was wonderful. Our room (1 bdrm with a terrace) was quite roomy and pleasant (there were 4 of us). We ate at the restaurants outside tables and had a blast with the staff. The food was good. We wished we could have stayed longer and we will go back.

<Content>What a great hotel! Made my first visit to NY 3-18 to 3-21. Had a 2 bedroom suite. It was wonderful! The bathrooms are clean and well stocked with goodies. Had a problem with the heat in one bedroom. Dont really think they fixed it, but opened the window.The suite was very spacious. Even had a doorbell! Nice to have a kitchen. The location is great. On a quiet street, yet close enough to everything you would want to see! The staff was very friendly.The consierge was great! The big plus was the balcony! What fun to sit out on nite in the city that never sleeps! Only had breakfast at George Oneil's. It was very good and almost too pretty to eat! Would surely recomend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Kimberly is great The Kimberly was outstanding. First we flew into Newark and since there were six of us, they clued us in to a Limo Service (Ask for Ralph 718-823-4350 GQ Limo $175 included tax) as it was cheaper than two taxis and didn't have the hassle of a shuttle. The rooms were killer. We had one with two double beds and a pull out couch (Sleeps like any pull out - Not like your bed at home but ok) and another one with a King and a pull out. Full kitchen. Very clean. Decent bathrooms (small but tidy). The living room and dining area were excellent and the best was that they put us across the hall from each other so we just left our doors open and ran back and forth. I think there are only 6-8 rooms on each floor and the people at the front desk and concierge desk were top notch customer service. There is a deli around the corner that will blow your socks off (Azure). On weekdays it has everything you can think of and was outstanding. Concierge also recommended Umbertos in Little Italy which has excellent food and a decent price - There is even a fun karaoke bar around the corner. Have fun in NYC and enjoy the Kimberly - It will not disappoint.

<Content>Great location, nice room, fair price We just returned from 3 nights at the Kimberly. After a slight glitch checking in (there were no rooms with king beds so we had to upgrade to a larger room), we were very happy with our surroundings for the three days. A stone's throw from all we wanted to see - including great shopping on Fifth Avenue, Central Park etc. (and a wonderful mexican restaurant called Mama Mexicano, one street away opposite Pampanos).Fantastic service. Very helpful staff. Spacious room. Would definitely return again ...
