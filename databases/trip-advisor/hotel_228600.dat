<Content>Great hotel in great location We are a senior couple who stayed in the Maria Elena Palace Hotel in Madrid for 2 nights in early October. We just happened upon a great rate of 75.00 euro per night, and boy, did we luck out! The room was on the small side but perfectly adequate for the two of us, and very spotless. The bathroom was very modern and also spotless. Plenty of hot water for the shower. It was only 2 blocks from the Sol metro station and even closer to Sevilla Station. We managed just fine with our rolling cases, coming from the airport on the metro. We would definitely give this hotel high marks and would stay again at that rate in a heartbeat. It was also very close to a good restaurant, Finca Susanna, where we loved the food so much, we ate there twice!

<Content>Great central location Location couldn't be better. On a side street, close to Plaza del Sol. The side street affords a quiet place in a city full of noise and people.A grand lobby beckons to days of old and the great hotels.Was disappointed in the room size and it was a little tight, but good enough closet space to get luggage out of the way and and excellent size bathroom with a good shower tub combination.You will pay for location, but that is normal.Interesting area and easy access to the undergournd and busses.No real problems with the hotel, had a nice airconditioning, which is important in Madrid.Front desk pretty average, but bar attendants were excellent as was the breakfast.We did not book the breakfast as part of the room as it was too expensive and found we could buy it cheaper upon arrival.Many excellent places to eat, most located in the numerous plazas, close to hotel.Odd to see the police station on the main walk way where the hookers ply their trade, but we felt safe at all times.

<Content>Pretty good overall We stayed at the Maria Elena Palace for our three days in Madrid and we enjoyed it. True that it's immediate surroundings are not perfect (tattoo parlors, arcades, etc...), but it's well located to be able to walk to almost everywhere. The room was very clean and relatively big by European standards. There was absolutely no noise (perfect for siestas), except for the room maids but it didn't last very long. The A/C was working perfectly too. The beds could be more comfortable but overall we were pretty satisfied with the room.

<Content>Location isn't ebverything Loved Madrid and must return one day but as for the hotel...........This hotel has garnered many good reviews,but I found it barely OK. First of all lets discuss its much vaunted 'location'. The reality is that it is on a side street just off one of the scuzziest streets leading off Puerto Sol. If your idea of location is having to walk past sex shops, piercing and tattoo parlours, shops sell questionable goods, pinball arcades, fast food joints, crowds of probationers queuing up outside the police station, ladies of the night plying their trade etc. then this place is for you. If you want to be greeted by things to delight the eye and the senses, look elsewhere.Someone said that the rooms were huge. Hello! the room size was a huge disappointment - barely room to walk around the bed.My most heartfelt criticism though, must go for the beds, in this case a double. Perhaps the hardest, must unyielding platform I have ever slept on, with the exception, when I was a backpacking teenager, when I slept on top of a brick wall!Complaints brought forth no help whatsoever from the desk staff.The breakfast was abundant in its ordinariness and I would suggest going elsewhere.Sorry folks, but that's my take on the Maria Elena Palace Hotel, Madrid.

<Content>Excellent hotel, good location This hotel is in a road near Grand Via and Sol and is hence in a perfect location for the central sights of Madrid. As it is down a side street, there is no noise which means a peaceful sleep at night.The rooms are well appointed, clean and well maintained. The bed was large and comfortable. The only downside was that the room was a bit small and there was nowhere to sit down in the room to read a book / relax apart from on the bed.The staff were very efficient - we initially thought that there was a problem with the air conditioner, and after contacting reception someone came up straight away. In fact, we realised afterwards that the aircon cuts out if the window is open - clearly a sensible idea.Madrid has everything for a short city break - the Prado etc, good parks, restaurants (we ate in an interesting Peruvian restaurant in Cheuca, Theatriz in Salamanca and the cheap and interesting Bazaar in Cheuca), bars and excellent Tapas! We even took a day trip to Segovia on the high speed AVE train, arriving in under 40mins...The hotel provided a perfect location to return to after our various sightseeing trips around the City. It meant that we could drop in and rest before going off again for dinner / shopping etc.Highly recommended.

<Content>Brilliant Hotel We stayed at the Maria Elena Palace for 3 nights in May. I was really pleased with our choice. A beautiful hotel in a quite place close to Puerto Del Sol (2 mins to walk).The hotel was realy clean, the rooms spacious and the hotel staff were very helpful when asked anything. We did have the breakfast every morning and although this was expensive it was good, they even made hot boiled eggs to order every morning for my husband! For a city hotel this is excellent, we couldnt believe how big the rooms were. When I booked online direct with the hotel we asked for a non smoking and quiet room. I dont know if it made a difference but it was nice a quite, we even had a balcony overlooking the front of the hotel.I would highly recomend this hotel, it has been one of our best choices over the years of city hotels.If travelling by metro, like we did, we found the easiest route was line 8 to Colombia, line 9 to Principle de Vergara and then line 2 to Sevilla. I would recomend coming off at Sevilla rather than Sol as this is a much quiter station and equal distance to the hotel. The metro was really easy to use and with good sign posting.

<Content>Just OK This is a marble clad, formal, business-man on expense account, old fashioned type of hotel. Hence to me, boring. The rooms are nicely furnished in a very traditional style and very clean with modern baths. The location is good, on a quiet street around the corner from Puerta del Sol, Madrid's main square. Near pedestrian streets. A couple of sex shops on adjacent street, but they are the upscale type, not the sleezy type. The tourist books refer to this street as a red light district, which is a major exageration. One probably could see more prostitutes near the Holiday Inn! The large fancier hotels are a couple of blocks away, but they are on busy, noisy streets.A couple of notes of caution. The part of the hotel I stayed in had a persistant humming noise, as if high voltage lines were running through a shaft in the hallway. The noise was especially noticeable at night. So if you are a light sleeper, without earplugs, beware of the rooms numbered _0_, like 507 that run along one side of the hotel and face the back. My sisters stayed in 405 that faced the front street and the noise wasn't really noticeable there. The staff at the front desk were minimally helpful day and night and not especially friendly. Seemed irritated to have to help you and their English was only fair (but way better than my Spanish!!) But they were never rude.Breakfast is an ample hot and cold buffet but it is 12 euros a person. My room had a mini bar but no coffee maker. There is room service and a bar and restaurant in the lobby.I would stay here again, but prefer to stay somewhere more interesting and less staid.

<Content>Nice Hotel Great hotel, the lobby floors and the most of the walls is marble, which gives it great looks. When I booked I was worried that it will look nothing like the images online (just like lots of hotels) but certainly it looks the same.Hotel location was just perfect, if you turn right you are in the old city part and if you turn left you are in the new city. One thing I wasn鈥檛 sure about is seeing lots of hookers down the street right next to the police station, which was right at the corner of the hotel. And the 鈥淢en鈥檚 only spa鈥?which was right by the hotel was little suspicious when we walked in trying to get a message but it was booked. The room service didn鈥檛 speak much English and was hard to communicate with them. The receptionist also didn鈥檛 speak much English but wasn鈥檛 as hard to communicate with. The room that was assigned for us (standard room with two twin bed) smelled so bad and I think they washed the carpet and wasn鈥檛 dry enough which made it stink. We requested to change the room, they first tried to spry it with air freshener but didn鈥檛 work then they gave us another room on the forth floor which was so much better and bigger then ours, the new one had a large balcony with a patio chairs which was great for sun tan. The front desk was very helpful when we asked them to book us a Flamenco show and we asked them to request a nice seat. We were surprised that they booked us a table right in front of the stage. We felt so special!

<Content>Fine Hotel but be aware ... Plus:Centrally located within walking distance of all major attractions.Room  bathroom bright, smart and, as reported elsewhere, very clean. Fine communal areas. Excellent hot  cold breakfast buffet. Unlike reports elsewhere, we found front desk staff most helpful and quite capable of multitasking under pressure.Minus:Centrally located between red light district on Gran Via (C. Montera) and pickpocket mecca around Sol (Pl. d Carmen, only 50m from a Police Stn.(!!), Pl. Jacinto Benavente  Pl. d Angel). Room small (barely space to walk around beds) and stuffy (unable to open window because of street noise). Beds v. firm.Not real problems if you are aware.

<Content>Maria Elena Palace an excellent Hotel Hotel Mar铆a Elena Palace, Madrid, Spain.Date: 12th March 2008Reviewer: A Trip Advisor Member, Dublin, IrelandWe have just returned after spending 4 days in Madrid. The city of Madrid is lovely and the Hotel Mar铆a Elena Palace is very close to all the Major attractions. Its five minutes walk from Puerta Del Sol and a quick Metro journey from The Prado and the Palacio Real. The staff could not have been more helpful and the room was spotless with a huge six foot bed and generous bathroom. The Hotel faces onto an ordinary looking street so we took an inside room which was very quiet and overlooked the internal atrium of the Hotel.The breakfast was very good with fresh juice, cereal, cheese, rolls, fruit and a hot selection.The reception staff recommended the Barbarroja restaurant in Cava San Miguel Street (near Puerta Del Sol) which was excellent with a great value Tourist Menu for 鈧?3. For a very cheap Oriental meal try WOK just around the corner from the Hotel. Also do not miss coffee and pastry for 鈧?.70 at La Mallorquina in Puerta Del Sol, the place is always packed and a great experience. There are lots of good shops near the Puerta Del Sol which looks good lit up at night as does the Plaza Mayor which is a stones throw away from Puerta Del Sol. Put aside at least two hours for the Museo del Prado and Thyssen -Bornemisza museums as well as the Palacio Real but the El Rasto Sunday flea market can be given a miss unless you really want rip off CD鈥檚 or videos.The Metro is the way to get around in Madrid but BEWARE ! of pick pockets especially on Saturdays and Sundays. They push you when you are getting on or off the Metro and are looking to where you are going. So keep your hand on your wallets and bags when are getting on or off to the Metro and you will be ok! We did and they went away empty handed.

<Content>Nice hotel room, terrible customer service The Maria Elena Palace hotel is located in an excellent location. It is walking distance to Gran Via and the metro. Initially we were allocated a small room which was not cleaned properly. I escalated this issue to the front desk and after too much haggling, I was allocated a decent room in the 3rd floor. Positives:1. The new room was spacious and had clean bathroom2. The breakfast is excellent and is a good value for moneyNegatives:1. Terrible customer service. Talking to the first desk was a nightmare. The lady at the reception was just too rude (BTW, I think she is the only one who can speak english!)2. The laundry service is sloppy, they do not speak english. In my case the clothes were not folded, they just got them in hangar and left it at the reception as I had checked out earlier. In summary, next time I am in Madrid I would move to another hotel which provides better service for the same 4 star price

<Content>Excellent quality hotel - very central I highly recommend this hotel which you can get for about 鈧?20 some nights. New build with rooms off balcony around an internal atrium. Rooms a little small for 4* (as others have noted) but good large beds and as clean as I've ever found any hotel. Secure and very quiet considering it is so central. It's in back street behind government buildings just 300metres from Sol/ Gran Via/ Sevilla metros.The bonus is lovely public rooms on ground floor which would particularly suit if you are with friends. Good sized Buffet Breakfast under domed feature roof was excellent value at 鈧?0. For a combination of location, quailty and value it's probably unbeatable. I thoroughly recommend.A warning, be sure you can expalin where it is as our taxi driver had no idea becasue it's only new.

<Content>Very Pleasant Stay We stayed in this hotel for three nights and had a thoroughly enjoyable stay.The hotel is very centrally placed with most of the main attractions easily reached by foot. Our bedrooms were spacious and the beds very wide - although a little hard for my taste. Bathrooms were also spacious and well equipped with plenty of toiletries provided - even razor and dental kits. Bedrooms and bathrooms were very clean.Our experience of the customer service was very good with the receptionist being extremely helpful. We had made a mistake with our e-mail booking but the receptionist sorted the matter out quickly. Hotel was obliging in posting postcards and arranging taxis.Breakfast was very pleasant with plenty of cereals, fruit, cheeses, rolls etc. on offer along with eggs, sausages and other hot items.We had read that a nearby street could be a little unsavoury but this was easily avoided and did not impact on our stay whatsoever.We would have no hesitation in returning to the hotel in the future.

<Content>Nice clean room, Horrible cutomer service First off, this was listed as a 4-star hotel on their website. Do not be deceived. It could have been, if not for the fact that I felt as if I was annoying the front desk staff with my mere presence. They were the epitome of bad service. When I inquired as to the bullfights (we were there over the weekend) they asked me to hold on for a moment while they finished their personal telephone conversation. Needless to say, five minutes later they were still talking to their friend on the phone and no one else came to the front desk to help us.The room was nice, but pricey. Be sure to take advantage of the included breakfast. It is not great, but is a fair way to start the day.A note of safety, the hotel is in the red-light district so beware if you return after dark. Just be sure to smile at the ladies walking around outside!

<Content>Great hotel, great price Great hotel for a great price. The rooms were large and clean, with a nice sized bathroom. Our room even came with a balcony. The hotel was nicely furnished, and appeared to be constructed or renovated recently.The location was busy, but convenient. Located near the Metro and the Royal Palace.The only drawback is that the hotel is devoid of character, since it is a larger more-modern hotel. But if that is not a concern, I definintely recommend it.

<Content>more than I hoped for Fantastic hotel in the heart of Madrid. Room small but well furnished. Breakfast was superb. Great value for money. Only complaint was that the hotel bar closed at 12. Not great if you want a late night drink. Still, probably had enough by then anyway!

<Content>The Silence In The Middle Of The Crowd THE LOCAL: The hotel is situated in a very small and narrow street between Gran Via and Calle de Alcala. This means that we are near themost important places of Madrid but at night in the room we are far away from the noise and we can rest. From the hotel to Gran Via is 3 minutes walking, 5 minutes to Puerta del Sol, 10 minutes to Plaza Mayor and Prado, 15 mutes to Royal Palace.THE BUILDING: When we watch the hotel for the first time we feel a certain deception because the aspect is too severe and grey, but we are obliged to recognize thar we are in face of a good adaptation of an old building.THE INTERIOR: Some reserve we had desapear when we enter in the lobbyvery beautiful with good furniture, the bar as well is veryconfortable and nice.THE ROOMS: Are very well furnitured but small. However in terms of confort are very well equiped and decorated.In my room the choice f TV channels was very poor. THE SERVICE: The service is really a 5 star hotel service. Very efectivness and staff well trained and simphatic.IN RESUMEN: A good stay

<Content>class act Classy hotel at a good price right in the very centre of Madrid (around the corner from the Place del Sol and the Grand Via and 5 mins from the Place Mayor). Friendly helpful staff. Had a beautiful lobby with glass atrium and very nice rooms and bathrooms - all sparklingly clean.Beds slightly hard and hot breakfast selection could be better but made up by the measures poured in the bar~! Quiet, except for some Saturday night street noise - but when you have seen Madrid on a Saturday night you will understand! Enjoy!

<Content>Quiet hotel close to Gran Via We stayed here for two nights upon our arrival in Spain. Our intention was to rest for the first day and then visit the outskirts of Madrid (El Escorial/Valle de los Caidos), so we were happy just to have a comfortable place to stay. The hotel is on a small side street with no parking underneath, but we found a public garage (expensive) a few blocks away for our rental car. The room had two twin beds that couldn't be pushed together, but the beds were comfortable. The lobby area was quite large with many areas where people could sit on couches or chairs and read, have a drink, or talk with friends. The breakfast was quite good, with a variety of eggs, meats, cheeses, pastries, cereals, and juices to choose from. There were also bottles of red wine and water for those who enjoy having that with breakfast. The staff was quite friendly and helpful. When I tried to use the computer in the lobby and had trouble with the access code that the attendant had given me, he took me behind the front desk and let me use his computer. The hotel was very quiet, which made us very grateful as we overcame our jet lag. For those who like to shop, it is very close to the Gran Via, the Puerta del Sol, and the Plaza Mayor.

<Content>Great Choice I stayed at the hotel with my two teenage sons and it worked out perfectly. The location could not be beat. You're in the center of the old town, which is lovely in itself, but also right near a central metro stop from which you have easy access to every other part of town. The rooms were clean and fresh; the bathrooms were great. The weakest link was the television which was small and often limited to 1-2 channels, but the staff said this would be fixed. Internet access is available but not wireless yet; you can plug in in your own room. A standout feature of our stay at the Maria Elena was its breakfast. It is an incredibly extensive, bountiful buffet with many items for both children and adults; and it gave us a great start to each day.

<Content>Great location We really liked this hotel - it was right in the middle of Madrid and within walking distance to good stuff like the Prado. Parking is not on site and expensive - about 30 euros a night - but it is a very secure lot. Staff were quite friendly, particularly the lady at the front desk. My advice would be to request not to be on the top floor - we were on top and the ceiling was slanted and we kept banging our heads!

<Content>Superb central location A few minutes walk from Puerto Sol gave it a central location allowing easy access by foot to all places of interest or to the Hop on Off bus. The hotel rooms were spacious and the bathroom shower fantastic. Front room noisy Fri/Sat due to popularity of bar in same road. Ask for rear room!!Breakfast a feast and all staff helpful-tours and Tourist bus available at desk. So called red light area was fine to walk by at night for ladies might be different for group of men so alternative route via Starbucks suggested. Fab VIPs across the road from Starbucks for cheap meal in clean surroundings, nice more traditional menu at restaurant next to Hotel REgina aroudn the corner. Did nto go to up to Gran Via for meals preferred areas towards and icnluding Plaza Mayor and other side of square. Do not miss the cake shop of the corner fo the square--Mallorquinna --best cakes nice coffee and upstairs window view of the square great.Would recommend quiet room in hotel and location 1st class. Zara, Mango and Cortes a few minutes walk!!

<Content>Do not look for another Hotel, this is it. This is a beautifully decorated hotel, with large rooms, very modern furniture and a very nicely appointed bathroom. The lobby is magnificent, the breakfast is included even though they do not tell you (better than the other way around!). Service is very good. You have wi-fi in the lobby, which has chairs, lounging areas, large TV, a bar till late at night, etc. The Calle Aduana is called a pedestrian street although cars pass through it (do not let a taxi driver fool you and say that he cannot take you to the hotel door: he can). When you go out of the hotel, you turn right and in 100 meters you are in the Porta Del Sol, the heart of Madrid. Within 7-10 minutes walk you have the best restaurant deal in all of Madrid at the Finca Susana: excellent food and wines, for less than half the price of all surrounding restos, plus great atmosphere and service.

<Content>A great Hotel right in the city center We stayed for one night at the Maria Elena and what a surprise for the price. The hotel is impeccable and certianly a 4 to 5 star hotel. Iit was a great deal. The location was right in the city center on a very quiet street. Staff were courteous and helpful. the buffet breakfast was 10 euros but worth the price. I would definitely stay here again and highly reccomend the hotel.

<Content>Great find in a fab location Found this trawling through the internet and was slightly dubious as it was such a bargain. We booked 3 rooms and it cost us 拢70 each for 2 nights. The rooms are big enough for a short break and we had two small double beds in ours. There is a room safe, wardrobe (big enough!), TV, and a great bathroom with power body shower. We also had a window that opened up to a small balcony- just enough to put a toe on - nice to have though.The hotel is in a fantastic location, hidden up a quiet side street but right where you need to be. There is a little cafe in the street for coffee/cake but turn left out of the hotel and then right and there is a Starbucks on the corner.Slight note of warning :if you turn right out of the hotel and walk for about 5 mins you come out into the red light area!! makes for an interesting walk but probably best avoided if easily offended!A great night out tip is Las Carboneras (Plaza del Conde de Miranda)- a flamenco restaurant which has the most amazing flamenco dancers. Need to book as it gets packed and it's a very small place - but very authentic.

<Content>Very nice experience. Very pleasant room. I'd asked for a something quiet and although the view was non-existent, the room was fine with two twin beds. Bathroom sparkling clean with great shower/tub. Wi-fi not available although the front desk staff told me the technician would be fixing it within the hour it never happened over my three-day stay. I did manage to pick up a free signal in my room. TV got CNN. Hotel is on a quiet back street and convenient to everything. Seville metro station is around the corner. Breakfast is great--lots of selection and was a good deal at 10 euros. Starbucks is just around the corner if all you want is a muffin and coffee (about 5 euros).

<Content>A Palace to call your home in Madrid Thank you TA folks! I had a time crunch to secure rooms in Madrid FAST and I turned to TA for assistance with a conveniently located nice hotel that would please a discerning crowd (mulitple room bookings) and WOW was I pleased! We stayed at the beginning of our trip to Spain, and again at the end (r/t flight Madrid to USA). First stay had no view room, but, as told on TA, the beds were great (firm), and showers excellent, and staff super nice. Got a room with a balcony for the return stay which was nice, but honestly, once in Madrid, I did not spend much time in the room. The location is A+. A Madrid friend asked about the did you know re the hookers, but no issues whatsoever. Just make a right out the door, left at the street, and you'll never know they are there if you want to avoid that aspect. Totally Not Scary - rest assured. People in our group adored the fact that Starbucks was nearby. Staff went above and beyond to ensure all went well for us. Will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Superb Staff After missing our flight into Madrid due to poor weather, we arrived very tired just before check out time. We were hoping to use the room simply for a shower, if we were lucky. The very gracious desk clerk couldn't have been nicer. We were allowed to check in, take showers and nap before leaving at 6:00 pm to catch our flight to Marrakech. The rooms were sweet, bathrooms great and we found the beds to be perfect but it is the service and warm welcome we will always remember. Thank you very much!

<Content>Great Location Our stay at the Maria Elena Palace was very favorable. The location was great. We were within easy walking distance of all of the major sites. The rooms were very clean and attractive. The buffet breakfast was good. The reception at the desk was excellent. All of our questions were answered promptly. M. Lopez was particularly helpful. As far as the questionable district around the corner. We walked home at 11:30 two weekend nights in a row, and I was not in the least bit concerned. A police station is located on the questionable street. This is a non issue.My only negative would be that the beds are very firm.

<Content>right in the centre Stayed for 2 nights, purpose of visit was to attend Rolling Stones concert. Reception excellent, efficient, friendly, was booked in very quickly. Room was very clean, comfortable bed, excellent bathroom with a very complex power shower! Breakfast, everything your could reasonably want from eggs,bacon etc. for the Brits to cereals, cold meats, cheeses etc. for the rest of us. Restaurant was of a high standard, food very well presented and not overpriced. Good bar lounge area with waiter service, again at reasonable prices. I have just one small critisism, after the Stones concert which was late 2AM in the morning, we had intended to take advantage of the all night room service for food. When requesting this I was told by a rather surly receptionist (male) there was no waiter available so we could not get any food. The main plus point for me was the position of the hotel, right in the centre but quiet. We walked to the Royal Palace, the Plaza Mayor, Plaza Santa Ana and el Retiro, all in easy walking distance. Next time I go to Madrid I will certainly be staying at the Maria Elena Palace.

<Content>Can't really fault the hotel Spent 5nights at this hotel between 10th-15th June. Found the staff very helpful and friendly (thankfully not to the American 'have a nice day' excess). The Concierge was more than happy to book restaurants, taxi's, help with directions and find tickets to 'sold-out' venues.Hotel is located in a quiet side street in an extremelly central location. Our rooms were at the front of the hotel  the lighter sleepers did on occassion hear the nocturnal bin men, but i'd imagine no hotel is immune to the din these guys make.Otherwise sound insulation was superb, helped by the side street location.For a Spanish 4Star hotel it was plusher than I expected (their website images dont do the hotel justice), Decent sized rooms (i'd describe the beds as firm which suited me fine), large bathroom with excellent shower, mini-bar and free in-room safe. Air conditioning/heating worked fine  windows that fully open .Didnt sample the restaurant, but drinks at the bar were well priced  service attentive.Back to 'location'. It's about as Central as you can get without being on a busy (noisy) main street. Just 2minutes walk to Puerta Del Sol (metro station  Madrid 'Vision Bus'), 3minutes to Gran Via  100yrds from the nearest Police Station (not that we ever needed to visit).Didnt see any hookers hanging around the hotel either (as mentioned in an earlier review). The only time we came accross them was when walking along one of the streets leading from Gran Via towards the hotel (closer to other hotels than the 'Maria Elena'). They seemed well behaved/restrained, werent approaching anybody and could go unnoticed if you're not paying attention. The street can easily be avoided anyway if you are of a delicate natureNon of our party could find fault with this hotel, excepting a very minor grumble that the hotel didnt have a loan iron (so, dont forget to pack a travel iron).Would recommend this hotel without hesitation

<Content>Great hotel Stayed here for five days and though it was ideally situated in the centre of Madrid, a stone's throw from the Puerta del Sol, it was in a quiet street and there was very little noise. We had requested a quiet room at the back and that was exactly what we got with a cracking view of one of the clock towers to boot. The bed was huge and very comfortable and the room was spotless although a little on the small side. The shower was interesting, if a bit complicated to work...I let my husband try it first!!!! We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel but there were plenty of places around about for a quick bite (La Mallorquina on the Puerta Del Sol was an experience, organised and chaotic at the same time but great pastries and coffee) The hotel lobby was beautiful, lots of marble and comfy seats and the staff at reception were efficient and helpful. All in all, I would stay there again.

<Content>Great location The hotel is conveniently on a small street right walking distance to the Prado and the Plaza del Sol. The lobby is comfortable and nicely appointed. The rooms are small and the beds are like rocks. All of the adults in our group commented on them. The hotel staff suggested that we use blankets to soften the beds. The garbage truck came every evening at midnight and made a huge amount of noise. This is a shame as the hotel had a lot of potential.

<Content>Nice but overheated Firstly I thought i already wrote a review on this hotel, but apparently I didn't, so here it is 4months late..!The staff were polite but a bit stern at times, I wouldn't really call them friendly. They all spoke good English but I speak Spanish and that was a real benefit - they seemed a lot, well, happier, when they talked to me than when they were being forced into English. Don't get me wrong, they weren't rude, they just weren't exactly happy.The hotel looks beautiful. Our room was spotless and the bathroom was huge but like previous posts the room was hot, stuffy and there was no circulation of air - we had to resort to opening the window at nights just to get some air, and this was in January, when Madrid aint exactly warm. If you have any kind of breathing difficulties I would think twice about staying here.The location is excellent - quite quiet despite being only a couple of minutes from Puerta del Sol. There is what appears to be a Goth Club just along the road, there isn't really any noise from this (our room was at the front and not far from it), but it does mean you get some interesting characters walking along the road at 2am! But again there was no problem with this.Breakfast was good, didn't eat there apart from that.Basically if you get cold easily and can speak a couple of words of Spanish, even just hello, please and thank you then you will love this place. Little tip on Madrid - the metro system is excellent - quick, clean, well signposted and not as crowded as e.g. London's. If you fly into baracas then the metro is linked to this (ok it's a bit of a walk from some of the terminals) and it's counted as part of zone 1 / whatever they call it - so buy a 10 journey ticket from a machine for (I think??!) 6 euros 80 - meaning that a trip to Sol for this hotel is only going to cost you 0.68 euros - or roughly 40p. Bargain!!!

<Content>Great location and very helpful staff Having just returned from a long weekend staying in this hotel, I would have no hesitation in recommending it to others based on the following:Location: So central, easy access on foot to most places and metro 3 minutes walk away, it is a very noisy busy city yet this hotel was located in a quite side street. Other reviewers had mentioned it being near a Red light District, don鈥檛 know what they were talking about, never came across anything or saw anything. It is walking distance of shopping area and areas to eat and drink.Rooms: Spacious, ours was on the 3rd floor and overlooked the street, large double bed, usual other furniture, bathroom was really lovely 鈥?marble and excellent shower, lots of room for two people to get ready. Cleaned every day. I have stayed in bigger and nicer rooms and can be a fuss pot ,but I felt it was really nice for what we were paying for anyway. Lovely decor in the room and a safe also. Staff: The staff at the reception could not have been more helpful and friendly especially the 2 girls whose names I cannot remember. They were always willing to help us with our queries, book us a restaurant, and recommend restaurants, book tickets and taxis. They set us straight on a few things so we would not be ripped off etc, showed us how to get places using the Metro. They went beyond the call of duty, I felt like the word 鈥淭ourist Information鈥?should be over the reception desk!One tip, the rate going on their own website is better than the rate on other sources such as hotels.com or expedia as it includes breakfast, however when booking on-line on their website it says it accepts Visa only. If you put 16 digits (any 16) it will bring you through to the next page which will allow you to pay by Mastercard or Amex etc. Alternatively ring the hotel directly. The price looks the same on the other websites but it does not include breakfast which the price on their own website does.

<Content>Very good value This hotel is located on a quiet backstreet 300 paces from the Puerte del Sol. You can walk to most of the big attractions from this hotel -- Prado, Plaza Mayor, Plaza Oriente, Teatro Real. The subway stop in the Puerte del Sol serves three different lines.The room was clean, modern, and quiet. The staff was very knowledgeabl, friendly, and helpful.We would stay here again and recommend highly.Stay away from the internet in the hotel. It is four times as expensive as any internet cafe.

<Content>smart and peaceful We have just returned from a three night stay at the Maria Elena Palace Hotel Madrid.In a perfect position situated on a quiet side street away from the hustle bustle and noise of central Madrid.Three Metro stations are nearby ( Sol, Sevilla and Gran Via ) making travel around the city very easy although we found Madrid itself to be a very walkable city.The hotel is smart, good quality.The bedroom we had to the front of the Hotel was beautifully furnished. Lovely marble tiled bathroom. All kept spotlessly clean.The Hotel has a very fresh feel. Everything looks new.Great hotel to return to at the end of each day to enjoy a peaceful nights sleep.Very good Buffet Breakfast with plenty of choice of hot and cold dishes.Snacks are available throughout the day from the bar and the Restaurant is open for both lunch and dinner but we did not eat there as there was so much choice of places in Madrid.Overall an excellent choice for those wanting a smart peaceful hotel in the centre of Madrid.We used the excellent Aerocity Shuttle service from and to Madrid airport costing 20 Euros for the two of us each way.

<Content>Great hotel, great location! We could not have been happier with our hotel choice--in fact, we were booked for two nights at the beginning of our trip to Spain and decided to return for three more nights at the Maria Elena Palace at the end of our trip. Both rooms were spotlessly clean, quiet, attractive, very reasonably priced and each had a comfortable bed with nice pillows. The rooms were small, but the bathroom was a decent size with a great shower with lots of hot water and excellent water pressure. The closet was tiny but the safe was easy to operate. The staff were extremely nice, responsive and helpful, and spoke very good English. In particular a lovely woman, whose name I believe is Nerea (not sure about the spelling) was most gracious and helpful. The location is superb for walking to museums, shopping and everything else, and there is also a metro stop very close by.

<Content>Very nice hotel - an oasis of quiet in Madrid We have just returned from a late February/early March 2007 trip to Andulasia via Madrid and this and another small hotel in Cordoba were the only non parador hotels we used. I selected the Maria Elena based on other Tripadvisor reviews who mentioned how quiet the hotel was because of it's location in a small alley despite being near the Plaza del Sol and walking distance to all the major museums and palacio real. This is a real asset since Madrilenos are out until very late at night and the noise from the street can be significant. When one has arrived from a trans Atlantic flight and suffering from jet lag, having a quiet place to sleep and adjust is a major plus. The hotel is sparkling clean, with nice public rooms and excellent breakfast buffet as mentioned by others. The rooms are small but still comfortable. The bathrooms are very high tech (took a while to figure out the shower with its 6 spray nozzles, fixed shower head and hand held shower!). The room was very warm when we arrived but that was quickly resolved by opening up the windows (very high quality, when closed the noise level dropped considerably) and turning off the heater in the bathroom since apparently the air conditioning was not working. Maita and Neria in particular were very helpful receptionists with excellent English. (I had left my credit card in Granada at the parador and Maita quickly contacted them and had them shred it.) One receptionist did give us wrong directions and was less helpful with phone calls, etc. Other reviews mention the proximity to a red light district; I feel this is absolutely a non-issue. Compared to other cities (we live in San Francisco), the area is clean and filled with people. We never felt unsafe walking to the hotel and were never hassled by people. We took taxis to and from the airport as well as drove our rental car to the hotel to retrieve luggage and were able to negotiate the small alley easily and park outside the reception area. My only negative comment is that several times the housekeeping staff did not get to our rooms while we were out in the late morning and early afternoon. Because we were sleeping in the mid afternoons during the jet lag adjustment period, once our room did not get cleaned at all because we opted to sleep rather than leave to have them clean the room. So better attention to our coming and going from the room (they have electronic locks and should be able to monitor this) would have been nice. And finally, on our last night before leaving for home, we were given a different room than our earlier one. Despite asking for a non-smoking room in the original reservation, they gave us a smoking room because it was the only one with an available double rather than twin bed. This wing of the hotel is adjacent to the restaurant which is the only public smoking area and the room itself smelled mildly of cigarettes. Make sure to ask for a non-smoking room in the opposite side of the hotel away from the restaurant. Fortunately Spain and Portugal as EU countries are passing more and more restrictive smoking laws so maybe in the future we in the non-smoking majority can go to bars and restaurants without having to reek of tobacco. I noticed my very mild asthma symptoms were increased during my stay in Spain. The back portion of the hotel is very smoke free. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel as a good value for the money (make sure when comparison shopping the web sites that you include meals and VAT taxes plus any fees to make sure which offers the best value). I had booked three days via the internet but also got very good rates at the desk for the additional days I added at the beginning and end of the trip (around 130 euros for room and breakfast).

<Content>Great Location Loved our three days in this Hotel, it was ideally situated for the open-air bus route, the Plaza Major and many other super places to walk to during the day and evening.The hotel room was a little small (we had insisted on a double bed) and also the room and hotel was a little hot for our liking as we tend to prefer more fresh air, but then for many people it might have been ideal at this time of the year. The breakfasts were good with a large selection and the hotel is extremely clean and tidy and the frontdesk staff very helpful. The only problem is it is situated in a oneway street and because of traffic problems in Madrid at the moment the taxi dropped us at the top of the street, and when we were leaving we had to walk to the bottom of the street!! Otherwise a great hotel and would return.

<Content>Unfortunate circumstances I was looking forward to staying here as it looked really lovely on the website. It turned out to be a very pretty hotel; clean, good location, spacious bathroom, lovely lobby  buffet. We were disappointed that there was nobody to help with our luggage despite traveling with an elderly person. The elevator was also very, very small. Our unfortunate mishap was that our reservation was cancelled because we did not arrive until 7 :15 pm the evening of our arrival date. Five days before, my credit card was misplaced and the company had to expidite another one over night. Our flight from Portugal was delayed due to weather and so we did not arrive at the Hotel until after 6 pm. Forgeting that the hotel would charge the room at 6 pm the day of arrival, I did not call to notify them of the change in credit card number. They were not able to give us a room despite arriving only 1 hr. later. They did pay our cab and put us in another sister hotel way out by the Barrajas Airport which only had the available room for one night. After calling the MEPalace manager and voicing our frustration again, they found a room for us at the Maria Elena the next day and paid for our cab back, but the inconvienience back and forth with my elderly mother was stressful. Lesson learned...if you have to replace your credit card along the way, don't forget to call the hotels or airlines you have reserved on with the prior number!

<Content>Excellent Hotel With A Great Location!! My wife and I stayed here here for four nights and spent New Year's here. It was great! The hotel had a nice bar, restauarant, and beautiful rooms. It is located right in the center of Madrid, Puerta Del Sol, with a metro station within a short walking distance. You can easily walk to all of Madrid's splendors from here. Also, there is a small bar/cafe next to the hotel called Barril. It is a great place to hangout and they offer great meals at even better prices!!

<Content>A jewel in Madrid - central and friendly We have just stayed at this wonderful hotel, together with our son and girlfriend. We made our reservation direct with the hotel and the staff could not have been more helpful and were a delight to deal with, especially Maria Elena, Franciso, Neria, Juan and Antonio. On arrival we were offered the choice of 2 rooms, one large at the front but this could be a little noisy as there is a club next door, or a very quiet, although smaller, at the back overlooking the glass dome top restaurant, which we chose. Usual facilities with a mini bar, powerful shower in the bath etc. Excellent buffet breakfasts were included in our Winter rate and we dined in the Restaurant where we were very well looked after and had a delicious meal - obviously a very good Chef and reasonably priced. This hotel is so central and within walking distance of all the major sights in Madrid. We would highly recommend Maria Elena hotel to anyone.Charlesworth Wiltshire UK

<Content>Beautiful hotel in terrible area! We went to check out this hotel but did not choose to stay there because it is inside a red light district. It is very close to the shopping streets of Puerta del sol. The hotel is hiding behind the shopping streets on a small alley. The hotel itself looks new.... spacious lobby with glass roof sitting area, clean and nicely decorated rooms. Definitely book on Internet because the rate is a lot less expensive. Only recommand to people who don't mind staying inside the red light district!

<Content>Excellent service, clean rooms, top location - would definitely visit again We booked the hotel through [----], pretty much trusting their recommendation. To be sure, however, we compared travel agent's story with the reviews found on the web: we found nothing but praise for Maria Elena Palace.Now, after having stayed for six nights around new year 2006/2007 we want to join the chorus of appreciation. Everything worked like a charm! The hotel was modern, clean and quiet. The staff was friendly and helpful. They spoke reasonably good English (and apparently managed their way in French and Italian although a group of smartass Italian tourists saw to themselves to correct their grammar) which helped things go smoothly.Even though the hotel's website mentions that double beds can only be found in suites, we got it simply by asking it on the reception. Apparently we were moved to fifth (uppermost) floor with a nice view to the Telefonica Tower. If the room was suite (which I doubt), it was terribly small - it was large by European standards, though.The location is excellent: Puerta del Sol and La Chueca were right around the corner.Lastly, we enjoyed the generous breakfast which was comfortably served until 11 AM. You could sleep without alarm clock until hunger wakes you up. ;-)

<Content>V. helpful receptionists Contrary to some other reviews on tripadvisor, we found this hotel to be excellent. The location was great, the decor was classy and the receptionists were all helpful and friendly, with good English to boot. Maite in particular gave us good advice on our trip to Granada. We experienced no noise but there was the usual problem of overheating the room. Recommended.

<Content>Great location, but lacks charm We stayed at the Maria Elena for four nights in early November. The room was clean, nicely decorated, and had a nice bathroom. Nothing spectacular, but a good value considering the price (we paid around 100 USD per night). Location is right near the city center, about a 3 minute walk from the Sol subway stop and the Puerta Del Sol. While some of the surrounding streets don't have any particular charm, there are some good restaurants nearby.The reception staff was not particularly friendly, but they were able to move us from a room with two twin beds to one with one king bed at check-in.

<Content>Won't hesitate to Stay Here Every Time! We booked this hotel for our stay in Madrid at the Maria Elena Palace after reading the reviews on this site. Tripadvisor did not fail us! The location is perfect, the rooms are quiet, new, absolutely spotless, and the rates are reasonable. The only criticism you might be able to place on the hotel is that the rooms are very small - much like New York City hotel rooms. We were only in Madrid one day. So it was nice to be able to walk to the Prado and find a great place to eat. The Maria Elena Palace was a lot nicer than we were expecting for the price we paid in that neighborhood. We like to stay in the Plaza del Sol area because it is close to great restaurants, major sites, and night life. Plus, you are close to a Metro stop to get you anywhere else in the city. Thank you fellow Tripadvisor members for telling us about this great little hotel!

<Content>This is the place your looking for! We just got back from Madrid and LOVED this hotel. It is close to everything, the hotel is new, clean and classy and very quiet. The rooms are elegant and the bathrooms have a more room than other hotels we have stayed in when visiting Madrid. The staff was great, very helpful. We plan to come back next year and will be staying here for sure!

<Content>Outstanding! I can't say enough great things about this hotel. On a quiet street in the heart of Madrid, within walking distance to the Gran Via (5 min) and other important locations such as Puerta del Sol. Rooms are outstanding, clean and staff is great. Maite was especially friendly. We booked an extra night while there and they gave us a great deal. You will not regret staying here. When I come back, this is where I will book!
