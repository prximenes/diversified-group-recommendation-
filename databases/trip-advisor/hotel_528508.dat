<Author>DickieB77
<Content>OK Hotel-too far from the action I've read many of the previous reviews. I'm not sure what the expectation is but if your expectation is to be in a business hotel 40-60 minutes outside of the city this fits the bill. The rooms are in line with a business class European hotel; small by American standards but with the expected amenities. The free wi fi is a definate plus not expected in Europe. The strongest point in favor of this hotel is the breakfast. Our room included the breakfast and was paid for by the company. Normally, I believe breakfast is quite pricey so if you鈥檙e thinking staying here, and of course you care about breakfast, try to negotiate breakfast into the room price. Hotel breakfast includes unlimited espressos and cappuccinos, croissants, fruit, pancakes, smoked salmon, local meat and cheese, eggs, bacon, juice, etc. A very nice spread and I鈥檝e eaten at a lot of hotel buffets. There is nothing close by for eating establishments so plan to eat dinner in Amsterdam. No comment on the hotel for dinner as I didn鈥檛 eat there. The hotel has a small fitness center, tread mill, bike some minor amounts of weights. Not much. Everything from this hotel is a drive or a tram ride. I read amount service comments. There are some bad apples here, basically some youthful slackers but I felt they were contained and didn鈥檛 impact me. On check in my wife commented that the clerk was a bit curt. However they let us check in at 8 in the morning and didn鈥檛 charge us a second day which was also unexpected. This is big deal as we were both exhausted from the flight. We hit the bed at 8 AM ish and slept until 4 PM without any disturbance. If you鈥檙e coming from the US, check this out. The WSJ did a piece a few years ago about London hotels that wouldn鈥檛 let people check in until 3PM. So I think a very nice feature. The worst thing about this hotel is its location. A five to ten minute walk gets you to the tram station. From there you wait. There is a schedule but essentially a tram comes every 10 minutes or so. Thus, the wait isn鈥檛 that bad. The tram ride is 30 minutes to a major tourist area. It runs right through central Amsterdam so you can get to most everything with a straight shot of a tram ride. The museum district, the dam, and the main train station are on the route. The hotel staff are not very helpful in terms of traditional concierge service. Essentially you鈥檒l get a very marginal amount of assistance compared to a concierge at a Four Seasons or Ritz. They try marginally to help and are polite but not very knowledgeable. So all considered, I would rate this as a three star hotel. The service is not great but not horrible. The rooms are reasonably clean. Proper amenities are applied for the style of hotel expected. The restaurant appears to be well stocked and in line with a higher caliper facility. Workout facilities are basic and there is no outside gym option. Attractions are too far away and add a hassle that, if you pay $300 plus a night, you shouldn鈥檛 have to deal with. In my mind, this is a hotel for people stuck on a layover from the airport who are going to stay one night and clear out. From that perspective, it is aces. The other group here would be tour groups on group rates. Tours can tout the 5 star hotel BS and one could argue it loosely fits the tour guide description. From a critical view, this is puely a thee star location. From any other view point, I have to think anyone who recommends this hotel just hasn鈥檛 traveled enough or experienced enough of the other options available given the hotel鈥檚 price point. There are far better options inside the city with easy access to the sights you came to see at better price points, so why bother with this place?

<Content>Beautiful hotel overall, if a little pricey. Hotel Artemis blew me away, what a gorgeous hotel. The room was fully equipt and clean, the food was great, the room service was great. The only complaints I have relate to the restaurant and bar- 14 euro for 2 drinks was excessive and the restaurant staff were incredibly unprofessional; they seemed not to know what they were doing and were very slow in bringing us drinks, our bill, etc.The hotel is a bit out of Amsterdam city centre, but it was easy to get the 145 bus behind the hotel to Leidsplein which was in walking distance from all the sites, or 10 minutes down the road to get the metro station where you get line 51 until station rai then change to 50 which takes you straight to centraal.I would stay again because it was such a beautiful hotel, but next time I might try something a little more down market to be closer to the city centre.

<Content>Excellent value Really nice hotel, friendly helpful staff with excellent breakfast buffet in the mornings.Close to Schipol airport so convenient if arriving that way and about 20 euros in a taxi or there is a shuttle bus or service bus 195.There are not restaurants or shops in the area which is a pain but its a bout a 10-15 minute walk to the tram and bus stops from where you are in the city centre in 15 minutes. The tram costs 2.4 euros or it is about 30 euros in a taxiI would recommend it unless you like having everything on your doorstep

<Content>Nice hotel, horrible location It describes itself as a design hotel, but there were very few touches making me think of it as that. The room was spacious, but staff was mediocre. Because of a flight delay, I arrived later than I expected and they had canceled my reservation (even though I pre-paid). It took almost an hour to get it resolved.My biggest problem was that the hotel is quite a distance from any restaurant or attraction. It's a bit of a walk to the tram and metro stations, and several minutes to get anywhere from there.

<Content>Not a bad option It is located 30 minutes walking from downtown, but there is public transportation to make your life easy, and always you can haul a taxi (average 15 Euro). The hotel is clean and nice, although is, somehow, already old-fashion. I though some years ago should had been a superb place, boutique style, but time has gone by, and what was avant-garde 8 years ago, today is kind of cheesy. Staff is not truly helpful; they have this frozen-fake smile that makes you thinking they are pretending. If the tariff is reasonable, it is a good alternative to the extremely pricing and not always worthy hotels in the tourist areas.

<Content>Good, modern hotel, reasonable price but out of the way I stayed here for 1 night and found the hotel to be new, clean with modern decor. Free wireless internet but no breakfast included in the basic price. If you are without your own transport then the trams are quite a walk away. My wife and I were very comfortable for the 1 night stay here.

<Content>Great for business Yes, the tv is bad and yes the room service isn't great and yes it's quit a long way from the centre of town, but.....If you're looking for a nice business hotel, one that actually provides nice and quiet rooms and doens't cost more then 150 a night during week days, this is it.I've been to most business hotels in Masterdam and most are comparable and some are better, i.e. the Hitlon or Westin, but most are almost twice as expensive during weekdays and are often fully booked.

<Content>Near the airport , 20 minutes from centre I peronally think that Artemis is a nice hotel . It is located very near the airport (take bus 195 to avoid excessive taxi rates ) . However it is not near the city centre (it is about 20 minutes with tram number 2 - station of tram is 5 min walk from hotel ) . Rooms are clean , there is lot of space, cable TV , and all amenities a traveller would require. As regards surroundings , i think the hotel is in an area the gives the impression you are in the country rather than in a city. A lot of green , many ducks, we even run into a rabbit once. Hotel staff is friendly. In general it is good value for money, i think it is a very economical hotel , as compared to other hotels in Amsterdam of the same class, and quality of rooms and service are high . !

<Content>Nice hotel, but EXPENSIVE There are many mixed reviews about this hotel so hopely this one will be somewhat informative. First of all the hotel is located quite some distance from the city center. If you need to get there from the amsterdam train station it is Tram #2. (In an altered state at night the night bus is #358) You can also take the metro, but its quite a walk from the metro station, about 2 miles. Its located somewhat between Amsterdam city center and the airport. Its in the same building complex with IBM and other corporations. The hotel itself is very interesting. The front desk staff is not the nicest. Not quite rude, but somewhat arrogant. Once we got to our room, i have to say it was nice. The only room left was a smoking room on the 8th floor costing 138 euro. Very Very expensive, but somewhat average amongst the other amsterdam hotels. The room was nice with a double bed and a flat screen TV. The bathroom was also very nice with standard ammenities. The room comes equiped with a mini-bar, and pay-per-view movies (12 euro each). Overall, not a bad hotel. The distance from city center is significant but honestly it is still very accessable by Tram or night bus requiring just a short walk. The neighborhood is very safe and quiet so it was not at all a concern. If the price wasn't so high and staff wasn't soo stuck up, i would highly recommend this hotel

<Content>Not bad hotel but too far out The Artemis Hotel is perfectly nice inside. The staff were relatively friendly (they smiled) and checked us in and out fairly quickly. The room was perfectly fine, very comfy bed, excellent toiletries, stocked minibar, air con. Nice flat screen TV with a selection of music tracks. All in all I'd say it's a nice hotel, however, the location is not great if you're wanting to go into the city. It's located pretty close to the airport and is a good 20 mins tram ride away. It's in a business district with no bars, cafes or amenities surrounding and is a bit isolated with no atmosphere. Perfect for business guests who want to stay near the airport, but not for tourists wanting a weekend getaway to Amsterdam.

<Content>Style over substance This was my first stay at this hotel as I was working nearby. The hotel looks OK and is clean and well built.However, this hotel is all about style rather than making your stay a good one.Things I didn't like:1. Slow check-in.2. Check-in staff with a bad attitude.3. A restaurant menu that's all about presentation rather than giving you a good meal. As a traveller I want to arrive and have a good quick, filling meal. The menu here is all about looking good.4. Poor veggie meal selection - the only veggie option was asparagus risotto.5. Restaurant staff who prefer to hide out of site behind the bar rather than be out serving diners.6. Slow restaurant service - we arrived at 9pm and left at 11:30pm even though we were in a hurry.7. Check-out take ages even though I was the only person in the queue. How can check-out take so long?I didn't have breakfast as it was 鈧?7.50. I'm not going to pay a fortune for a couple of pieces of bread and a coffee. However, my colleague regretted going for breakfast, as they were missing bowls, spoons and the queue for the single coffee machine was 20 people long.This hotel could easily be a pleasure to stay in but at the moment it's more of a pain.

<Content>What is Good Design? Billing itself as THE Dutch Design Hotel, I think Artemis comes up short .I was always of the understanding that good design is not just about style but also about functionality and it is here that Artemis goes way off piste. Consider: Where would one expect to find a lightbulb? Above a mirror adjacent to the hair drier? In the shower cubicle? Not at Artemis, here you shower and dry your hair in the dark or half light if you're lucky! And what about those little things like the full length mirror. For 2 days I complained a bout a lack of one until I discovered it behind the inner door - handy location! The desk chair I sat on to draft this review looked great but boy, after only 5 minutes I had a numb bum as it was unpadded. So, how does one work at the desk? answer, by using a bed pillow to sit on - a great look I'm sure you'll agree. Lastly, and to THE most annoying aspect (aside from the unsealed oak floors and soaked in wine stains together with the tip toe of stilettos on ones head morning and night) is the positioning of the light switches. Not content with poor task lighting, even turning them on is difficult! Some lights are controlled by switches one side of the bed and some the other; so you toss and turn in bed before even going to sleep. Then there is the bathroom; the door opens to the left and so guess where the light switch is placed? Yup, you've guessed it, on the left, behind the door, this coupled with the fact that the bathroom door opened tightly against the bed effectively seals the switch from your grasp. But, with glass doors and a light sleeping partner, perhaps it was done on purpose - you know - don't turn me on you'll wake them up!Lugging baggage up and down to reception on arrival after being checked into an occupied room, TV not tuned, no air con in the gym, lack of storage for 2 persons clothes, and baggage, no laundry bag or list ( I only found out on leaving there was a laundry service), overpriced breakfast 17.50 euros, 10 minute walk to the nearest tram stop and a good 30 mins on a tram to the centre of town, would I stay here again? What's your guess?

<Content>Stunning Hotel! Loved this hotel - stayed here for one night in August 07 with three friends. Its modern, clean, new and really special.The breakfast was amazing and the staff great.Its quite far out of Dam centre but the tram is just down the end of the road. i wouldn't stay here again if I was only in dam for 1 or two nights as I would prefer to be in the centreAnything longer though and I would definitely stay here...

<Content>Stylish but lacks substance Clean hotel. Affordable. Bed's are reasonable comfortable but could be stiffer. A little bit too far from the tram.MAJOR PROBLEM: The cleaning staff. Most importantly, they stole 50 euros from my wallet. And the wallet was not in plain sight. It was burried in my backpack which was in my suitcase. Not at all thorough, took away used bottles of cream and shampoo without replacing them. The top cover of the bed was made but the underlying sheets were left rumpled and untouched.

<Content>Nice hotel, indifferent location This is a good hotel - nice layout, well furnished, interesting decor. It's downfall is its location - on the outskirts of Amsterdam in a business ara between the city and the airport. I took my girlfriend here and I chose it for its arty-boutiqueness but in truth I woud have been better off choosing a traditional, central old-fashioned hotel in the city centre. That's not to criticise the hotel - the staff were fine and it is well designed and a good place to be in. It's just its location lends itslef more to the busines traveller than the tourist.

<Content>Nice but a little far removed It was a nice hotel and had nice rooms but we had some trouble with the staff on arrival as they originally gave us a twin room which we complained about as we had booked a queen room and they were not very accommodating about changing this for us. we eventually got it altered though and the service the rest of the time was great. The pillows on the bed are RUBBISH! but other than those minor misdemeanours, its a nice hotel though a bit far from the city centre. it takes 10mins to walk to the tram and then about 15-20 mins on the tram. breakfast is 17euro50!! so we didn't eat it. we just got something once we got into town. great and cheap place to eat in china town just behind the red light district is eat mode, great food and very inexpensive.

<Content>Bad hotel stay away. The Artemis Hotel in Amsterdam.It was my first and last stay in this hotel.The welocome was ok no problems there.After check in we got our card for the room.When I arrived on the second flor opened the door of (my) room to find out that the room was already occupied.Imagine your self having a romantik moment with your wife or girlfriend and then a completly stranger comes in the room...how 4* is that?Ok ,I went down told the reception about that matter and eventualy got an other room.Checked, and yes there was no other people in. I arrived with my car from Germany and was told that the hotel has a private parking for the costumers.A privated paying parking that was.Rates 2.40euro per hour...Ok Amsterdam has a parking problem ,I accept that,but Artemis Hotel is not in the centre of the city.A lot of spare space all around the hotel is free, but no you have to pay.So...here comes the hit...When I got back from town the first day I saw 4-5 cars parked outside the hotel.A Mercedes , a Range Rover sport , Porsche and an other car.I decided to park there also.First day ok ,second day at 22:00 I wanted to leave the hotel and saw that my car had a nice parking ticket of 50 euro.The area of the hotel is far away from the center where you really should be carefull where to park...and there are no police controls of course.Wild guess...the hotel called for the police to give tickets because they was loosing money from their huge underground parking lot which should be free for a 4* hotel...at least. The room cleaning service...Bad BAD bad.The room cleaning was only to change towels and make the beds.That is all.I had a smoking room...my ashtray was never cleaned ,some small garbage was never removed and the best of all together is some of my MONEY WAS STOLEN.Oh yes I have evidence for that.I left some change money like 5-6 euros on the desk in my room and took a picture of them with time and date also left a 50 euro bill and left the room.When I come back the 50 euro bill there the garbage was there the ashtray full like always but the coins where gone.Just great for a 4* hotel don't you think.I went to the reception told them to change my departure for the next morning.I hope you all have a nice time in the famous Artemis Hotel.

<Content>Nice Hotel, rubish staff! My Girlfriend and I already knew first hand that this hotel was a bit of a distance from the centre of Amsterdam, we had stayed there before. Two years ago give or take a couple of months. We where impressed enough to return to the Artemis by the modern spacious design, the adequate fresh clean rooms and the excellent buffet style *FULL* cooked breakfast included in the price.On this first stay we had found one member of reception staff (who checked us in) to be quite unwelcoming almost to the point of being rudely abrupt. However, we never thought much of this and the rest of the stay was perfect.  We stayed again this year (from the 1st Jan 08 in fact!). Whilst some aspects of the hotel where the same, the general appearance and well maintained quality feel of the room and the rest of hotel remained, other aspects had without a shadow of doubt, got worse. When we arrived at the hotel at around 9am, we intended to get a couple of hours sleep to top up the few hours we had managed to get before our early flight. We where told that the check in time (earliest) was 2pm.  We looked, and this was indeed stated in small print on the reservation form. Whilst of course it was not the receptionists fault at all, and we where fine with coming back to check after 2pm, it was the way she dealt with us which concerned us. She was very unsympathetic and inhospitable towards us. We ourselves had to suggest simple things like leaving our luggage in the hotel until check in, and filling out our forms and necessary details in advance so she could have our room ready as quickly as possible when we returned after 2pm (we still intended to catch those couple of hours sleep before seeing some Amsterdam nightlife). When we returned at *5pm* to check in things got worse. We stood at the reception desk for *TEN MINUTES* looking at the*TWO* receptionists behind the desk and trying to make them engage with us or at least say that they would be with us in a minute or anything just to acknowledge that we where standing there waiting. They *BOTH* continued however to deal with a rich European woman who was also it seemed still waiting to check in. When we finally got seen to by the frosty female receptionist, we explained that we had already given our details and signed check in forms that morning. She left us waiting for a further 5 minutes before the guy asked us all the same questions. It turned out the girl earlier had messed up and had left the form lying around or something. When they eventually found the it, the guy said (after trying to charge us a further 100 euro鈥檚 for a deposit we had already paid) that we would have to wait to check in as 鈥渢he system was down鈥? He gave us 2 free drinks (one each lol) at the bar whilst (he said) he would fix the problem as soon as he could. Another 20 minutes past. We had long finished out tiny Artemis cocktails (he specified which drinks we could have!), so I suggested to him we WOULD be having another complimentary drink which he agreed to. When we eventually checked in the room was clean and fresh as was the bathroom to the credit of the cleaning staff. The other problem id' like to mention will no doubt seem very petty to some of you but let me explain. Remember, we had stayed here before and the things we liked about the hotel where why we returned for a second stay.The breakfast before had included hash browns, tomatoes, and a selection of eggs (not just scrambled).Worse still we where told at check in that the breakfast service would finish at 11am. We went down at about 10:15am to find that breakfast was (for a reason which nobody bothered to explain to us) finishing at 10:30am instead of 11am. Again the staff where very defensive about this and again not apologetic in the slightest! They where taking away trays of food whilst people where coming down to eat!!! The earlier time was the same for the whole stay.From reading other reviews it would seem that the rudeness of the staff at the Artemis is a problem for lots of people. A smile and polite hospitable attitude are expected from hotel staff the world over. It isn鈥檛 allot to ask for.(*pleas read*) What we are most upset about is that we missed pretty much a day of our stay in Amsterdam because when we finally checked at 6pm, we fell asleep and didn鈥檛 wake until the next morning as we where so tired. This is a nice Hotel but I wouldn鈥檛 give them any more of my money in the future.For a 4 star Hotel they lack allot of hospitality and simple etiquette.

<Content>Grotesque overrated - try somewhere else!!! Stayed there for one night only. No one at the entrance to meet and care for your luggage (remember: 4*-hotel). Hotel is far from central town, expect 30 minutes to get to citiy centre by foot and tram. But especialy the service is totally incompetent: After our arrival we complained about the tidyness of the bathroom - there were e.g. disgusting stains on the toilet - to the staff at the reception. The guy there seemed to be irritated that we couldnt name the exact spot that was to be cleaned but asked for a second run through by the houeskeeping through the bathroom. He promised to care anyway. When we got back in the night the bath was no cleaner than in the afternoon.The Parking is - comparing to the distance to Shiphol and City centre - much too expensive (15 鈧?the day). Too sum it up: A nice surface but with imcompetence beneath.Don't go there!

<Content>Nice place - quiet location the hotel was nice, very modern and stylishly decorated. didnt spend too much time there as was to-ing and fro-ing in and out of town, which is about a 15-20 walk away or you can just jump on a tram around the corner from the hotel. ideal for business travellers who dont want to be in the hustle and bustle of the city centre. beware of taxi drivers they will rob you blind!

<Content>Charming and hip Hotel Artemis was everything we were looking for in a hotel. Large, comfortable room with all the amenities, excellent restaurant, and a well-above-average breakfast buffet. The staff made a mistake with the Design Package we'd booked but quickly corrected the situation. Parking was expensive (15,60 euro for 24 hours), and the nearest tram stop is a ten-minute walk, but other than that it was great.

<Content>A lovely place! Once we arrived at our hotel, the reception was very friendly and showed us to our room immediately. We didnt have any problems with the service, the room was amazing for the price we payed which wasnt much. The bathroom was a little dirty though, but you really have to search for the defects to actually find one. When it came to the chambermaids cleaning up the room, it upset me the way they changed the sheets and just threw our clothes in a pile on the bed. We found some of our clothes underneath the bed too. Breakfast buffet was lovely but it was also included in the price, if youve got a room only deal, it is a little expensive at 17.50euros a day. The main downside of the hotel is that the restaurant is EXTREMELY expensive for what it serves. The waiting staff are all lovely, but when the bill arrived we were shocked! I suggest eating out. Although the hotel is not in the centre, there is sufficient transport taking you there. Tram number 2 is a couple of blocks away and takes u straight up to central station, and Tram number 145 takes you to the Leidseplein. There is also a bus close by (number 195) which takes you to and from Schipol airport.

<Content>Lovely Hotel - would recommend My partner and I have booked to stay at this hotel in November and it will be our third time here at The Artemis. We dont mind at all the 20 min tram ride into central Amsterdam, as it really is such a comfortable hotel. Ok the surroundings arent the best (with the business park) but the hotel does make up for that with its comfort and style. We would recommend a great company called travelrepublic to book with. Through them we've recently booked 2 nights for 拢116 (per room) and that includes breakfast. We've used travelrepublic before and have got it even cheaper! The only negative would be the TV channels but apart from that, its a great place and no doubt we would stay there again! Enjoy!

<Content>Nice hotel with unfriendly and untrained staff The hotel is recently opened and therefore the rooms are very new and clean. The design concept is nice and the rooms and the hotel is well decorated. The bar and the food are both very good.The hotel is outside in a business area, so you should only stay here, when you are on business trip or have a car.The really bad thing about this hotel is the staff. They are very lazy, untrained and unfriendly. Did not fill up minibar, takes them ages to do soemthing (e.g. get the bill, help you with luggage ...), when you are complaining they are just laughing at you... it is really terrible - therefor I would never return.

<Content>Nice and new hotel in Amsterdam We were on a short scape for 4 days in Amsterdam for tourism (i went with my girlfriend) and we were looking for a comfortable hotel, secure and easy to get to it from the airport. It was really a nice price for the hotels in Amsterdam but you have to pay for it being in an industrial suburb of the city. I mean industrial because it is a kind of park full of companies such as IBM and more, but it is really close to another neighbourhood were people live apart from the city chaos.The hotel is very very new, with an styilish design and very modern.It took as a little ride in the bus from the airport which lead us to the door of the hotel.It is out of the city noise but indeed out of the centre of Amsterdam but it was nothing problematic due to the fantastic tram service which is 5 minutes walk from the hotel. It took us around 20 minutes to get to the center but we used to spend all day out of the room so it was perfect for us.We were on a weekend and the monday and tuesday after and there were no noise from the outside during week days.The room was huge and we had a nice flat tv and a nice bathroom as well. Everything was perfectly clean and the bed was very comfortable and wide.If you are looking for something in the middle of everything, this is NOT your place but if you are looking for a new, comfy and modern hotel with all the good things and apart from noise and shared bathrooms this is your choice.

<Content>Lovely Hotel - We are just back from a long weekend in Amsterdam, having stayed in Hotel Artemis. Having read some of the reviews regarding this hotels location I was quite worried. However I should not have have worried at all, as the location is absolutely fine. Yes it is a bit out from the City Centre, but as long as you are aware of this when you book it should be fine.We got the 195 bus from Schp Airport which dropped us off around the block from the hotel, (3 mins walk), and back to the airport again, Its a very frequent bus.Getting into the city is perfect, the No 2 tram takes you right in as far as Central Station, passing Leidseplein, Dam Square and then Central Station. The Tram Stop is a little more then 5 mins walk from the hotel. The last trams stop and midnight and then night buses kick into action. The 358 night bus drops you off at Aletta Jacobslann, Same as tram stop. Location is really not a problem staying in this hotel.Hotel itself is lovely, clean and friendly staff. We didnt eat there, the only complaint I would have about the hotel is that breakfast was 17.50 per person. ( It wasnt included in our package)Oh yes another piece of advice, get a travel card for the buses and trams, its so much cheaper, we got a 72 hour card, that did us the whole weekend, and it worked out really good value(13.50). Its so much cheaper then paying per trip as you go

<Content>Wonderful Such a wonderful design hotel! Probably the cutest hotel I have ever been to. Everything is brand new and spotlessly clean. Our room was splendid and the bathroom was hyper modern, with the best power shower I have ever tried. Would go back at once!

<Content>not too shabby sharing a room with a pal, it cost us 拢2 each per night which is really quite reasonable for a nice hotel. beds were comfy and food was nice. staff were a little rude though and beer was about 拢4.50 a pint. Bus into central amsterdam was worth it for the savings we made id say.

<Content>nice place - bad location While this is a nice hotel we would not really reccomend for a trip to see amsterdam centre unless you have a car or a lot of cash for taxis! Its a long way out and while the metro and train run regular its a good 10 min walk to the station, not really what you want at night. The rooms are nice something similar to a tulip inn. The decor is refreshing but not spectacular. the resturant food is good but not a lot of choice and the hotel bar is not the best, no atmosphere.The staff are friendly and helpful. The place is ok for business but not really suited to a holiday break as nothing to do and 30 euros away from anything interesting.

<Content>All facilities fully booked We booked a weekend stay in the Artemis Hotel in November 2006. On our arrival, we were told that all the facilities (restaurant etc) were fully booked by a Corporate event happening nearby. It was suggested we either use room service or the sister hotel located miles away with no transport! As neither were great choices, we had to arrange taxis to take us for all meals. I wrote to complain but was met with a useless response.Staff poor, location poor, hotel standard (rooms etc) adequate.

<Content>Location not an issue - awesome hotel! This hotel was very art-chique, and for Holland had good sized rooms, beds and bathroom. Very, very clean and modern, the restaurant had some good food but best is the interior design. We found it a little hard to find, and it IS a bit out of centre, but the #2 tram takes you RIGHT into the centre every 10 minutes, and the night bus works great for those coming home late. The service was *amazing* at this hotel and I would definitely stay again.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel in peacefull suroundings This hotel is EVERYTHING it advertises. The people who book to stay here and neglect to look at the location first, are idiots. The hotel is hard to find but we found it nice to explore the area. The hotel is new and in a business district. It was quiet and on a main tram route. We managed to see all the sights and have a few late nights without the hotel location being an impediment.We stayed here for 4 nights summer of 2005 at the same time the international fashion week was on. There were pretty people eating oysters on the deck of the beautiful restaurant. Very cool if that鈥檚 your thing. I have no complaints at all with the hotel. Staff were nice. Rooms were really big. Food was FAB. All was clean and new. All was as advertised. If i had to say anything is that the interior decoration is MUCH better than shown on the hotel pictures.

<Content>Love Artemis hotel Last February i went 4 days to Amsterdam and stayed at Artemis hotel... What a great experience. From airport we took the shuttle services that left me at the door of the hotel. At check in receptionist was a great lady and gave all of our instructions for the room and gave us advice about city and a map. Getting to the room was great, especially after a travel through Europe in little rooms and not so nice bathrooms. Very modern room, excellent beds, great bathroom and what to say about the buffet breakfast. Excellent!!!!!! Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And don鈥檛 worry about distances. A little walk you get to the first tram station and from there to city centre. At night, again, get the tram and no more than a 3 minute walk back to the hotel. It good to get to know a little bit more. Really recommend it!!!!!!

<Content>Desing hotel but very unconfortable beds! Hotel situated between Schiphol Airport and Amsterdam. To reach the cemtrum you should take Tram 2 from Station Aleta Jacobsson (it takes 10 minutes walking to reach this station) and to Dam Square is around 20 minutes. Lobby. Very big with sofas to seat down.Lifts. There are 3 big lifts enought to carry one big group in minutes. Reception. They will request a deposit to allowed you to use de telephone, pay Tv  Minibar. Atention if you have a group of people there and you are guide because the amount of this deposit could reach 1.500 euros.Rooms. Clean but some rooms of my group had some litle problems in bathrooms like wash-hand basin with broke cap. Or shower that shed out water. etc. But the most important problems I found was the beds. In singles-rooms they have instead of a bed a Sofa-bed wich is impossible to sleep. The double rooms have a regular bed but the mattres is too thin and the sheets are short so in the morning you wake up with your bed complete chaosRestaurant is good. Very good buffet for breakfast ans during the lunch and dinners the service was good and the food well presented and good taste. Bar. If you order a wisky with seven up you will pay 12 鈧?but you need at leats to drink 5 to feel a bit happy. It is maybe 1/2 centimeter of alcohol in your glass.

<Content>Great Bathroom! Came back yesterday from a 4 day break in Amsterdam. The Artemis made our break very enjoyable. This hotel would be best described as 'No chintz', very sleek and modern, clean with friendly staff. A little far out from town for tourists (25mins to Central Station) but I found that getting the bus 145 from behind the hotel to Leidesplein then progressing into town via a tram, broke up the journey. The only complaint I have is upon our departure. We had an early flight, and checked out at 6.20am We tried to get some breakfast (which we had paid for) before our taxi arrived at 6.30am but were told that we couldn't as breakfast doesn't start till 6.30am. As it is a self service buffet we found this rather frustrating...so I helped myself anyway!

<Content>Very Impressed, what value! I was very pleased and totally impressed with all aspects of this hotel. Squeeky clean, new and fantastic value for the money. Tram into the City was a piece of cake. If you don't need to stay in the City, I would highly recommend this gem. I made several international calls from the room. Upon checkout, I was expecting to shell big bucks out to settle the account. To my pleasant surprise, the cost came to just over 3 euros!

<Content>Wish Travel Inns were like this in England Having read the reviews on the Artemis Hotel we booked a short break to Amsterdam in March. The bus pick up and drop off was so simple from the airport.We arrived for 9.00am and were shown to our room without any hesitation whatsoever. Great to be able to drop the bags and get straight off into the city . Tram goes from around the corner which we found no bother at all.Not at all like a travel Inn We would be going every weekend if there was an Artemis Hotel built here.Great place to stay great staff and great value.Really recommend it

<Content>out of the way-prety hard to find After short flight from Liverpool arrived at Schiphol at 9am. Caught bus no.164 from Schiphol Plaza outside airport, get off at Slottervart IBM and hotel is just across road; Hotel is on Business Park.Checked in at 9.30 am with no problems getting our room. Rooms a bit dark be warned, don't touch the minibar as it cost us 13euros for four cans of pepsi! Take your own!Quite a walk to Tram stop that takes you to city centre (Outside Hospital), but once you have the ng of the trams, its a fascinating experience- if alittle long at half an hour to centraal station :(Rooms very clean, but staff have a bad habit of wandering in-and-out at strange times of day. Don't leave anything of any value inthe room, noticed someone had been in whilst away and moved certain items not relevant to cleaning.Apart from that, breakfast buffet very nice- we found this Hotel to be on a par with the 'Travel Inns' of England.

<Content>Very Poor This place does certainly not rate as a 4 Star hotel. Its location to Amsterdam is terrible (30 mins on bus or Tram to central Station).We checked in at 1410 (1400 check-in allowed) and was told our room was not available. It was 2 hours later before we were able to get one allocated and then given the key cards to the wrong room. More messing about to get the receptionist to try and understand what the problem was. We were invited to have a cup of coffee during our wait and was then charged for it.The rooms whilst clean and tidy and not particularly big and rather sparsely furnished (the Modern look).Personnel items were taken from the bathroom. When we complained to management, they just shrugged it off.Check out was just as bad, taking 45 mins before the computers finally ground out our bill.Business people, whose company is paying the bill may enjoy this place. If you are paying out your own pocket, STAY CLEAR.(I did put in a written complaint to the management, with all my relevant addresses, I never had a reply).

<Content>Good hotel to spend some time when flight is canceled! Due a snowstorm and a canceled flight I ended up at this hotel, thanks to Scandinavian Airlines. Overall I can say: they picked a nice hotel! + Design is great - modern but cosy. + Hotel bar is nice, prices are decent and the housewine is pretty good.+ Modern design of rooms: wooden floors, modern bathroom with bath, coffee / tea maker.+ Comfertable bed.+ Breakfast was good, with everything you want.- I couldn't find a clock in my room?- TV didn't work. Of course the location wasn't important to me since SAS rebooked me to a flight the next morning.I would recommend this hotel to travelers who like design and aren't annoyed by the fact that it will take some time to get to the city centre.

<Content>Where is It? Finding the hotel was terrible,once we found it though everything was superb.My partner and I stayed for 2 nights the room was lovely nice size and very comfortable bed!!The staff are probably the most helpful I have encountered in various hotels around the world.This as i said was all let down by finding the hotel, here is my tip.Get the Bus 164 from the Airport get off at the IBM stop(you ll see what i mean) Cross over the road and the Hotel is facing you .If only i'd known that rather than walking round for about 45 mins trying to find the place!! Tram no 2 takes about 15 mins to the city centre but is very reliable and very punctual. I would stay there again

<Content>Not a great experience We stayed in October and can't say great things about our visit.The location is great for business travelers but not tourists.The food was moderate at best and the service was slow - poor.It was clean and the interior was nice but the restaurant was totally disorganized. We also left a wake up call one morning which we did not get until 2 hrs late. When asked about this, they said oops! We missed an appt because of it.The view from the room was an industrial park....

<Content>Good hotel REALLY BAD LOCATION I Have just returned from a four day stay at the hotel artemis.if you are looking for somewhere close to stay near the city centre THIS IS NOT IT!! TRAM 2 goes near the hotel get off at aletta johansson, then its about a ten minute walk.The hotel itself is very modern and feels very new.The service was good apart from when we ordered room service for breakfast and it did'nt turn up.The manager was very apologetic and for the next three mornings sent us a feast! This hotel feels very much like it's in the middle of no where especially at night when it is very deserted.My partner and myself wanted to be closer to the city centre and were very dissappointed at first,but the bedroom swung it for us, the beds were so comfy.IF YOU WANT COMFORT DON'T BE PUT OFF BY THE LOCATION.we really enjoyed are stay at hotel artemis. *BEWARE DEPOSIT REQUIED* 60 EURO PER DAY IF YOU DONT HAVE A CREDIT CARD.

<Content>Bad location but great interior The location overshadows the hotel comfort. After getting off the TRAM (i don't remember the actual stop but it is available from some other reviews), there were about 3 groups looking for the hotel. After you get off the TRAM, walk directly parallel to the TRAM line as if you are following the leaving TRAM that just dropped you off. Keep walking straight(the TRAM line will turn to the right after about 100 feet but you must walk straight), walk about 1/4 mile and you will see a small sign on a street pole, indicating that the hotel is to the right. Take that right and hotel is on your right about 200 yards later behind the IBM building.Again, locatoin is terrible. It will take you about 25 minutes to make it to the city. The hotel itself is excellent. The beds and the comforter covers were the MOST comfortable bed and comforter we have ever slept in. Hotel had great modern feel and very helpful staff. However, our wake up call was about 10 minutes late.We thought, we would not mind walking for about 10 minutes from the TRAM to the hotel and another 15-20 minutes on the TRAM, in exchange for a great hotel but for us, the location did not over come the hotel luxuries.Good luck and enjoy!

<Content>Great hotel, shame about the location Very contemporary hotel with helpful staff and great decor. Stayed with my 3 kids - 14 to 5, and we all enjoyed our stay there. On the day it rained heavily they even managed to rustle up some brollies to lend us for our day out. The hotel would have benefited from a pool which I would expect at a modern hotel of this style. Didn't eat in the hotel apart from breakfast that was fine. The menu offered only a few choices that sounded good and at a sensible price but didn't offer the range I needed to meet the kids needs. The trip into the city centre was fun but at 30 mins each way inc the walk to the tram stop, meant that we tended to stay out in Amsterdam all day rarther than out, back to the hotel, eat and then return to the centre. If I had been a woman I may have been put off by the walk to the tram as the hotel is in a commercial area which was deserted after normal office hours. The kids had the superior room that was fine with a decent sized shower. Their view was over the hotel pond and the canal. I had the executive that was bigger and had a large walk in shower and seperate bath with overhead shower. The view however was of the office block next door. Given the lack of pool and location I felt that the price I paid was about right for the hotel and I would stay again.

<Content>Very impressed with Artemis We prebooked a double room at the Artemis online for three nights. through Superbreaks. The room rate was very good and included breakfast. We understood that the hotel was very new and a bit out of the way from the city centre, however this appealed to us as it would be quiet. Getting to the city was not a problem as there is a bus stop a couple of minutes walk at the rear of the hotel and a tram stop about 10 mins down the street. We recommend getting the number 2 tram from Alette Jacobslaan which will take you straight to town and terminates at Centraal Station. We also recommend you buy a 1,2 or 3 day pass from a metro station so you can get on and off whenever you like. We paid 10 Euros each for 2 days travel. If you are getting a taxi from the airport it is a good idea to provide the address of the hotel since it is new. The trip should coast between 23 and 28 Euros. Any more than this and you are being taken for a ride. Once at the hotel, staff will call the cab company they use frequently if you want to cab it. We found our room to be very clean and tidy. It was very modern and stylish in a minimalist way. There was ample hanging space for clothes and drawers as well as a place to store your empty bags. The room also provided a digital safe for important documents, valuables etc. There was also a well stocked mini bar. For those of you who like digital flat screen TV's, there was one of those too. The bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in and ensures a good night sleep so you awake refeshed and ready to tackle the city.The staff were extemely welcoming and helpful. From the moment we stepped out of the cab we were taken care of. Our bags were whisked away and placed in our room ready for us when we had completed checking in. There was a slight problem with assigning room numbers to electronic keys so our keys did not work initially but this was resolved with much apology and explanation. We looked on it as a quirk of travelling rather than any real fault on behalf of the staff. It was something to laugh about. Breakfasts were very good with a large variety of choice. All tastes were catered for incluing full English, continental and even donuts for the American palette. Also for Americans, if you are having the waffles, they provide real maple syrup. Sorry, no marmite for the English ;-). The breakfast buffet was well maintained with staff constantly checking if items needed replenishing. We ate one evening meal at the hotel restaurant and were treated to a complimentary starter. The main meal itself was very good, well presented and hot. Staff do not expect gratuity but it is nice to show your appreciation. If the weather is good, staff will open the glass doors at the rear of the restaurant which open out onto a patio beside a large glass-like water feature. You can eat your meals out here. We ate one breakfast outside and it was very pleasant.Overall, we were greatly impressed with the Hotel Artemis and would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it to anyone travelling to Amsterdam.

<Content>nice hotel a very pleasant clean and tidy hotel. Rooms were quiet and well equipped. I'm going back this week end.a little far from city centre, perhaps a walk of up to 10 mins and a tram ride of 20 mins I think.
