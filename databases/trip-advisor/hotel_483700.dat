<Content>Excellent A very good, modern hotel in a traditional building. Well furnished and decorated rooms, kingsize bed, full bathroom with bath and bidet. Good soundproofing, heating etc. No tea/coffee making facilities which was a drag. We had a 3 nights for the price of 2 deal, which made it exceptional value.Staff were charming and very helpful.Breakfast a bit pricey at 11 euros but it's a help yourself buffet, so if you've got a good appetite in the morning you can 'fuel up' for the day ahead! Alternatively there are local cafes that will do coffee and cake for 2-3 euros.The local area is a fairly well off residential district and the streets appeared safe. Plenty of choice of very good cafes, bars and restaurants. The hotel is ten minutes stroll from Urgell metro. The Aerobus from the airport drops you off at the metro but picks up on the return trip from a stop just 200 metres from the hotel (turn left out of the hotel and the stop is by the children's playground in the centre of the road).

<Content>LUXURY AT AN ECONOMICAL PRICE...SMALL, COZY BOUTIQUE Luxury at an economical price. Magnificent modern/graphic original art throughout lobby and rooms. Small, cozy, definitely Boutique- Hotel. Large, spacious ind. rms. Glass front windows curve with hidden corner entrance, each with a different colored giant letter- together spelling AMISTER. Truly a unique hotel sign, that blends into the neighborhood and sets the modern mode for the hotel decor!!!BEST BREAKFAST BUFFET OUR ENTIRE 40TH ANNIVERSARY TRIP, INCLUDING FOOD ABOARD OUR 12 DAY CRUISE. Staff goes out of their way: made 2 great recs for restaurants within 3 block walk. Overlooks/ is on an Esplanade- typical Moderniste apartments with balconies...locals walking their dogs,etc. Web site excellent with perfect driving directions from airport. (ONLY THING MISSING IS A HAND RAIL DOWN INSIDE CURVED MARBLE STEPS ENTRANCE- BUT THEN EUROPE IS NOT EXACTLY HANDICAP FRIENDLY.) STAFF CARRIED ALL LUGGAGE. Would definitely stay again.

<Author>GlobeTrotter351
<Content>Loved it! Everything was exactly as advertised and some things here are even better. We were able to get our room at noon, which is always great after a long flight. The rooms and beds are spacious. Also, we were worried that since it is out of the center, that maybe cab drivers would not know it but that wasn't the case at all. As others have said, the metro stop is far (a 10 min. walk) and there is not much as far as food/drinks on the immediate blocks nearby. But if you don't mind walking, there are lots of places close enoough nearby. You don't need to get the breakfast because there are cafes on the way to the metro where you can get coffee and pastries for about 2 euros a person. The staff was so helpful, plotting all points of interest on our map, making dinner reservations, and arranging for a credit card payment for the ride back to the airport. Barcelona is fabulous and Amister is a great base for it!

<Author>Stranger_in_town
<Content>Exactly what we wanted Great hotel - spotless and modern. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious and immaculate. The breakfast buffet had a lot of choice and was nice and fresh. The croissants and pastries were delicious. If you book this hotel, do so via the website to get the breakfast included in the price of a night. The hotel was a bit far out of the centre of town but we didn't mind the walk to the metro station.Wish there had been a satellite TV channel in English but after all the walking I don't think I would have stayed awake for a whole programme anyway. What a fantastic city!

<Content>Mixed Feelings My mother and I stayed here for 2 nights and generally found the hotel to be alright.Th Good PointsStaff friendly and helpful enough - recommended a couple of local fish resturants; allowed us to use their laptop to check-in to our flight on-line; gave us directions and good sight-seeing advice; good sized clean room with bigger than average beds; located within 5 mins walking distance from the airport bus stop; nice safe part of the city.The Bad PointsTook us 1 hour 15 mins to check-in (there was a group pf delegates checking-out after a conference); the 11 euro breakfast while nice is seriously over-priced; the hotel is far from the city centre and a 10-12 mins brisk walking distance from Hospital Clinic (the nearest Metro station); our room was freezing as their heating was not working; there were no porters to help with baggage.Tips Coming from the airport to the city centre it's best to get the airport bus and get off at the second stop at Urgell. This means staying on the bus past Catalunya and Prestige Paseode Gracia. The bus then goes down Avenue de Roma.The city is best experienced during high season May to September as a lot of the attractions had restricted opening times or were closed completely Also the weather did not feel very Mediterranean and rained quite a bit which prevented us from visitng some of the oudoor attractions.

<Content>Great place to stay I stayed here with my boyfriend who is vegan. We arrived at 10pm and the staff found us a vegetarian restaurant, printed out a map and rang ahead for us. The room had a lovely bathroom, was comfortable and had Sky tv and a mini bar but the bar gladly lent us a corkscrew to drink our own wine in our room. It is a couple of minutes walk from the airport bus stop with a fare 3.90 euros to the airport and buses every 15 mins. We were told the nearest tube is Sants, but it is actually Hospital Clinic, with a direct line into Seguda Familia..Gaudi's cathedral.Local bars are excellent, lots of tapas. One word of warning..you need to speak Spanish in this part of town, because there are few English speakers Overall, a terrific stay. Would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel Great hotel in a good location. 5-10 minutes walk from Sant Estacio which has 3 train lines but only a 5 minute walk to Estrenca. Clean, big rooms with good bathrooms - with a bath! We didn't have breakfast because there are lots of lovely bakeries nearby selling croissants and pastries.Reception staff were really friendly and helpful - let us leave our bags there on our last day, gave us their laptop to borrow and were generally v good.Only one complaint - the air conditioning in our room was a bit tempremental so it was quite warm but I'm sure that if we'd bothered to complain, the hotel would have fixed it or moved us to a differentroom.

<Author>Mike.001
<Content>Good value hotel My wife and I stayed for 4 nights and had a very enjoyable stay. The hotel is relatively new, in an artsy style, if somewhat cold, but perfectly pleasant. Rooms are pretty standard hotel rooms but decorated to give a slightly different 'feel'. Good size bathroom with an excellent shower. One thing no-one has mentioned is the CD player in the rooms, which would have saved me some luggage space if I had known. We did not notice the noise problems mentioned in other reviews; in fact I found it to be very quiet.We arrived for a late check in and were dealt with competently by very helpful staff, something which was repeated throughout our stay.Yes it is slightly out of the city centre, but the taxi's are very cheap and there are hundreds of them, the bus stop is over the road and the staff will advise on which numbers you need. We did a lot of walking, 20 minutes to the PL de Catalunya, but you get a much better feel for the city on foot. It is more of a business district so you do need to head back in the evening to the city centre for the main restaurants / nightlife, but for us this just aded to the experience.Would I go back? Absolutely, it is good value for money, other than, with so much choice; why go to the same place twice!

<Content>Nice but noisy Were transferred by an overbooked hotel to the Amister in Barcelona. It's a stylishly designed modern and clean premises with helpful staff and very good restaurant.It's a good 10 minute walk down Via Roma from the Estacio Sants station, but Entenca and Hospital Clinic metro stations are slightly nearer.The room was spacious and stylish with excellent facilities including CD stereo, flat screen TV, bidet in the bathroom etc.The main problem apart from the common difficulty of Barcelona hotels with traffic noise outside was the design of the central atrium which ran from floor to ceiling throughout the building. The heavy modern room doors surrounding this were banging on entry and exit for each guestroom, and were audible throughout the 6 floors. The effect reminded me of the echo of prisoncell dramas!!!The friendly pharmacy around the corner seemed prepared for my request for earplugs after the first night of our three night stay, and had no less than three different models available. They helped considerably, but more functional floor divisions, while a little less Gaudi, might have produced a lot more sleep.

<Content>Not for the noise sensitive. As a newer hotel the property is in good condition with a artsy, stylish bent to the decor. Rooms are contemporary  functional although the pillows are of poor quality. The staff is friendly and helpful, speaking perfect English. Location of the hotel is convienient to Sants train station but not in the heart of tourist BCN although if you enjoy walking, not too far from sights. Close to Barcelonas gay area. The hotel advertises WIFI in room however mine was very weak and the front desk advised me it did not work past the 2nd floor at which time they provided a cable connection. The architectural design of the hotel while appealing, with an atrium reaching from lobby to roof is a poor design as all noise from all levels can be heard by each room at all times. i.e. when gsts. come in at 1am and slam their door or depart at 5am and slam their door all guests share the experience.

<Content>Hard to fault I stayed in the Amister with a friend in April 2005. The hotel had only been open 6 months at this time so some taxi drivers didn't know where it was, but that should change. Although it's not central, for me the location in the Eixample district was fine: 10 minutes' walk from Sants station along Avenida de Roma, and two blocks from the nearest tube station. It's just two or three tube stops from the main tourist/dining areas of La Rambla/Placa de Catalunya/Passeig de Gracia/Diagonal etc.The hotel itself is very stylish and modern, with good facilities: sumptuous breakfast (but get in early if you want the hot stuff), air conditioned rooms, multi-channel flatscreen TV etc. Our room was a good size and had a large bathroom, and the decor was very 'cool'. Only complaint was that our room had a (locked) adjoining door with the next room (presumably for families) and there was some noise as a result.Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Amister. I don't know what prices are like as we were transferred there from another hotel which was overbooked.

<Content>Nice Modern Hotel but.... How do I get there? We stayed for 2 nights at the Amister during our Honeymoon. We hadn't been in Barcelona before so we took an advice from a friend who used to live there. Stay at the Eixample he said. Well... we did stay at the Eixample, but had no idea that It was so big and that our hotel was so poorly communicated. Publicity said it was near Sants station... well, near means 10 long blocks (15-20 min walk). And by the way your nearest metro stop, and your nearest bus turistic stop. There's a bus station near by, but nobody was willing to explain us the routes, etc. However, if you looove to walk or you are willing to pay the taxis. The Amister is a GREAT hotel. Bedrooms are clean, new, modern and quiet. They all have nice features as beautiful bathrooms and Plasma TVs. Breakfast was delicious, including the famous spanish egg  potato tarta, yogurth, cereals, pastries and a huge variety of cold meats. Service is great, and the front desk helped us build a turist rout for the two days and even helped us find tickets for a Barcelona Soccer game and for the movies. Will I stay there again? Probably, but I'll study bus lines before.....

<Content>Great modern hotel at reasonable prices This is one of the nicest hotels that I have stayed in in Spain. The hotel just opened Oct. 2004, the interior is very stylish, there is a cool lounge and a nice place to have lunch, it is not too big. The rooms are very modern and stylish, the breakfast is great (good coffee, fresh squeezed juices, great Spanish pastries, fresh fruit and etc.) The price is very reasonable for Barcelona. The location could be more central, or a metro could be closer, that is the only drawback.

<Content>One of the nicest and friendliest hotels I have ever stayed in the world. One of the nicest and friendliest hotels I have ever stayed in the world. The hotel is very modern, clean and has a very relaxing feel to it. The Rooms are very modern, extremely clean and beds extremely comfortable - proper duvets and soft pillows, not just blankets which you get in must hotels. Bathroom is extremely spacious as there is plenty of room between the toilet and the shower/bath, great mist free mirrors and very soft towels!Breakfast is a bit better than your standard buffet breakfast on the continent, but you have all the necessaries and can eat as must as you want!The service was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, they recommended were to go and showed us in detail how to get there. They even sorted us out with FC Barcelona tickets an hour before the match at cost price.The hotel is within walking distance of everywhere. It is only 10 minutes walk from Sants train station, which has a regular train every 30mins to the airport. 15/20 minute walk from Las Rambla and Pl. de Catalunya, one of the main shopping and dinning areas, 15 minutes to Sagrada Famé“†lia and 20 minutes walk from the Nou Camp.When we were checking out, I was very impressed with the way staff handled a very awkward and rude American pair, who were complaining and giving out before they even checking in. The dealt with the matter very professional and were extremely friendly and courteous to the pair.

<Content>Worst place to stay in Barcelona Iéº“ve been to Barcelona many times, usually stay in the city center but this time I decided to try this newly builded Hotel. Big mistake. Altought the Hotel is nice, the staff is higly unattentive and unpolite. Specially front house staff which were extremly unhelpful. Breakfeast was not good either. I dont know haw can they claim to be a four star hotel. The other good point is that no one in the city knows where this Hotel is, therefore if you want to take a taxi there you have to give directions. I wouldnt recommend this place at all.
