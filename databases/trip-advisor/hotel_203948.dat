<Content>Great stay I had stayed at Hotel Pendini in 2005 and had a very small double room that was unfortunately exposed to some significant piazza middle-of-the-night noise. This time, I had a single that was probably double the size of the previous room. It was in a different section and required walking through a couple of passage ways. I believe the room number was 401. The bed was queen size and very comfortable. There was absolutely no noise problem in this room. I have been pleased on both occasions with the breakfasts offered at Pendini and have found the staff helpful. A very good experience overall.

<Content>Fantastic location in the heart of Firenze I stayed here alone in the middle of June 2007. I got a room right next to the reception and felt very safe and looked after. The building was just the most charming place I've ever stayed at. My room was facing the backside but I imagine the view from the rooms facing Republicca must have been amazing. The room was clean and welcoming. The breakfast was so so, but ok. The location of this hotel is amazing, in the middle of Piazza Della Repubblica. You feel like you live in the very heart of history with just a short walk to the Cathedral.Great hotel, but chose one of the many pasterias for your breakfast.

<Content>Some rooms are better than others We stayed for a few nights at the Pendini because my parents love this place. They've stayed here a few times and have always enjoyed it.It's listed here as 2 stars and it's at the very top of that range, in my experience. But I didn't love it like my parents did. The place does have a funny smell, our room was passable but nothing special. The breakfast was poor (but the bread edible enough to grab on your way out the door).The location is excellent.All in all, it's a great place to stay if the price is right. Get a room higher up if possible. Also consider that some are noisier than others (though in my books the noisier rooms have more atmosphere as they look out over the centre of town, which I prefer).

<Content>great location we had 2 days in florence in july and liked the room we booked at the pendini. there were 5 of us and the room was very spacious and has wonderful airconditioning which was great as we hit a 40 degree heatwave. The location was great but check out the side streets for restaurants as the plazza is expensive. we drove into florence and one of the reasons we chose Pendini was that they parked your car. I would not reccomend driving but if you do this service was excellent. The breakfast was good and the internet access was a bonus. The directions by car were very confusing and it was a bit of a challenge finding it, so take a good map.

<Content>Nice We stayed at the Pendini for a week while visiting our son who was in school in Florence. It is a very charming, older hotel. For the price, it was fine. We could have spent 3 times that and stayed on the other side of the Piazza at the Savoy but why? After a day, we were able to move to room #207 which I would ask for. It looks down on the Piazza which is lively long into the wee hours of the morning and if that bothers you, ask for a room on the backside of the hotel. Room #207 would remind one of the movie A Room with a View. It has a fabulous view of central Florence. It is close to the river, the Duomo, the Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio, all the high end designer shops and is surrounded by dozens of restaurants. It has a very nice continental breakfast .The staff was very polite and helpful. When I read some of the reviews that said otherwise, I have to wonder if they are classic ugly Americans and got what they precipitated. If you expect to be in some place like the Beverley Wilshire or the Plaza, go spend $750 a night over that the Savoy. For the price point and location the Hotel Pendini is hard to beat!

<Content>Great location and nice property We had a great stay in their family suite with a second bedroom. The internet computer in the hall is a great feature and a good continental breakfast. Located right on the Piazza Della Republica close to everything. It was a challenge to get the rental car to the hotel with all the one way streets before returning it but we made it! Wouldnt recommend using a car there, walking much easier. The staff was friendly and even got the room ready early so we could drop our bags.

<Content>Great location, good hotel We spent 3 nights here in July. The location was perfect for wandering around town and being able to stop in the hotel to rest up. It was a bit hard to find but all the streets are one-way (usually in the direction we didn't want) so it took a while to get there. We used the valet parking and it worked fine. Just be sure to leave your 4-way flashers on while the car is waiting for pickup. We were almost given a parking ticket but the receptionist sorted it out. The breakfast was good with croissants, bread, yogurt, fresh fruit, meat, cheese, coffee, jams, juice. We had a family room that looked out over the back courtyard so the only negative would be our view. We had a family suite that was large, had a nice updated bathroom and fluffy towels changed daily. It was clean. Overall the hotel could use a coat of paint but that is a small complaint.

<Content>bad attitude, wrong information, go somewhere else ! I choose this hotel after reading the review by Lonely Planet's (2006) and this site. The only good thing about this hotel is it's location - smack in the middle of old Florence. We ordered a superior double room with breakfast for three nights. Arriving at the hotel with a car is complicated due to the street layout of old Florence. The GPS was not helpful as where directions from locals. when I called the hotel they where uncooperative on the phone. when we got there we realized we have to take the baggage to the fourth floor of the building in a small, old, smelly elevator. we then received a small, dark, dump room looking at one of the inner courtyards. The bed was two single beds, the bathroom small and smelly and the toilet seat broken. The TV set was the size of my cell phone screen and the cupboards had no shelves. when we asked for another room with double bed and a normal cupboard and bathroom we recieved a hostile response. They told us all the rooms are the same and that they have NO double bed in the establishment and that we should use the extra bed for putting our cloths on. We were shown two other even smaller rooms at same condition so we stayed in ours. The breakfast is a joke - Heated coffee, factory croissants. A shame for an Italian to even look at those. When we contacted our travel agent (who called the owner) we recieved the owner's response - the bathroom is great, they don't like our other rooms, I don't see the problem.The worst thing about Pendini is the attitude we received from the stuff and the owner. I could probably stay in stables if someone smiles at me and try to make me comfortable.For the 120 Euro per night + 25 Euro parking you are better off staying at any other hotel in the area.

<Content>Big Disappointment I stayed at the Pendini in 2000, so didn't think to check reviews. Big mistake!!! While the room I had in 2000 was very nice, this was quite a different experience. We were scheduled to stay 3 nights. The room we were given (Room 108) was small, but not terrible, until late that evening when we attempted to bathe. The tub/shower combination was tiny, uncomfortable and unsafe. We complained and were given a different room (Room 409) the next morning. It was three times the size of the previous room and had a great bathroom. We called the Pendini from Rome as we thought we had left an item there and told the clerk we had been in Room 409. He replied we have NO Room 409). This leads me to believe that they give the awful rooms first and if nobody complains, OK. If a guest complains, then they give the phantom room (409) to them. I would never stay here again, despite the wonderful location. It is a shame, as this could be a perfect hotel if someone just fixed it.

<Content>Really trying for that fourth star This three-star hotel seems to be trying for its fourth star. We stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms. These rooms are huge for a European hotel. The Pendini is located next to the Piazza Della Repubblica, which is a mixed blessing. It's centrally located, near shops and restaurants, the Duomo, market, and Ufizzi gallery. Plus, it's a short walk to/from the train station. However, the square can be very active at night. When we stayed at the Pendini, there was a singing accordianist with an amp and microphone in the square below.

<Content>Perfect Hotel Pendini The rooms were wonderful..spacious, clean and awesomely comfortable beds. The location was perfect as everything was near and within walking distance. We had a view out our window of the Plaza Rebublica with its charming carrousel. The staff was helpful and courteous and to round everything off, the breakfast was plentiful and tasty.

<Content>Group Review of Hotel Pendini We took a group of college students to Italy and spent 5 nights at Hotel Pendini. We had several rooms reserved so we were able to see a variety of what they had to offer. The rooms were great, very clean and had spectacular views of the Piazza. The walls are thin, but they are most places we stayed on our trip. We couldn't have asked for a better location and the hotel staff was very accomodating to are needs. They even had free internet for the students to get on. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Old, but Good We spent 2 nights at Pendini and were pleased with our stay. It is located right on a main square and within easy walking distance of everything there is to see in central Florence. There is no parking on site, but they have a valet service that will pick up your car and store it until you are ready to leave, then they will deliver it back to the front door of the hotel. The cost was about 20 Euro's per day. If you arrive by car, as we did, you will definately want to use this service.Our room was very large with two beds in it, one king and one twin. It was on the top floor and over-looked the square out front. We even could see the top of the Dome. The bathroom was adequate, especially by Italian standards. The hotel is located on the 4th floor of the building. When we were there the small elevator worked ok, but we've heard that it does go out from time to time which would be terribly inconvenient for checking in/out and after a long day of walking around town.I have also seen complaints about the noise from the square at night. We didn't find that to be a problem. The first night there was a large gathering of young people in the square that turned into a street party with dancing and music. Florence is very much a college town with students everywhere so you are going to have some issues like that, especially in the city center. It ended by about 1 am though. We are younger people (early 30's) so we usually didn't get back to our room until after 10 anyway and didn't mind the music. The second night there was no real noise at all. We slept very well both nights.Florence is a must do and the location of Pendini was tough to beat. It is just 2 blocks from the Cathedral and about 4 blocks from the Ponte Vecchio. Our longest walk was about 10 blocks to the Pitti Palace on the other side of the river. There are nicer hotels located on the same square and also some located with great views of the city and on the river. But the combination of price and location made it easy to overlook the minor imperfections of Pendini.

<Content>Awesome location! I booked this hotel through Venere. I wasn't hoping for much because I haven't had good luck in Florence before. I was pleasantly surprised at the Pendini. It was a little bit worn around the edges and needed some TLC, but it had alot of charm and a great location in the center of everything. The bathroom was small, but had been newly remodeled in Marble (watch out when the floor it wet!). Our beds were comfortable and the breakfast was good. We didn't have too much contact with the staff because we had such a full schedule, but they were helpful and professional. The hotel was clean and it was easy to find from the train station. I would stay here again when I return to Florence.

<Content>Unfortunate experience! While the staff at Hotel Pendini was wonderful and the location fabulous, our stay in Florence was clouded by our stay at this hotel. We dreaded walking through the hall of this hotel as it smelled of sewer, Rains had caused an issue. While our first room was unbearable the second was a bit better after leaving the windows open. We couldn't wait to move on to the next city. I do hope this hotel gets it's issues fixed as the staff is very nice to work with.

<Content>Great find in central Florence This centrally located hotel was perfect for our needs. We had a wonderful window view overlooking the Piazza Nationale. Could not find a better location. All the main points of interest are a 10-15 minute easy walk. The room was large, the bathroom large and most important to my wife a bathtub. Even though located on the 4th floor, the hotel had its own lift. We felt very safe. Breakfast was a typical European spread with plenty to offer, clean, and window views of Florence. The staff was helpful in suggesting places to eat. Was able to leave my luggage at the hotel after checking out. Everyone was very accomodating.

<Content>One to avoid Our stay at the Pendini ruined what has otherwise been a womderful trip to Italy. The room can only be described as dismal and depressing, and felt like a room in the local dungeon. The 'paper thin' walls gave us privvy to the bedroom habits of those above us and the early morning chorus of the local builders. The bedroom in question was room 101 and we can only presume that Mr Orwell had spent some time in the summer of 1947 looking for inspiration for his apocolyptic vision of the future!!

<Content>Great! The hotel Pendini greatly surpassed our expectations for one of the cheaper Roman hotels. It was a perfect location and very central to all of the sites. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and everyone spoke great English. Breakfast was included, and it was very good. The rooms were very cute and very quiet!! The bathtub was TINY, but otherwise was sufficient.. The elevator was the tiniest thing I have ever seen in my life. That was the worst part. Otherwise, I highly recommend this hotel and I'd stay there again.

<Content>We Loved the Pendini The Pendini is an older hotel right in the heart of old Florence. Our room was reasonably priced, comfortable and nicely decorated; the bathroom was a standard small European bathroom. The room air conditioning kept the room cool, and it was hot when we were in Florence in July. The breakfast was a very good buffet breakfast with fruit, yogurt, juice, pastries, cheese, etc. The staff was helpful; we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Florence Hotel Florence - Hotel Pendini19 May, 2007We've just arrived home from a week in Florence. Our stay at the Hotel Pendini was fabulous. On the fourth floor of the arch in the Piazza Republica, the hotel is centrally located, walking distance to all the sites that the city has to offer. The rooms are reasonably priced, clean and comfortable, and the staff of the Pendini is fantastic. We were served by Barbara, Pamela, and a crew of helpful folks whose names we didn't learn. Their restaurant recommendations and reservations were first class. We've enjoyed the Pendini's hospitality in the past and will certainly stay with them on future visits to Firenze.Bernard  Bette GoldsteinSaint Helena, CA

<Content>Worth the money! We stayed 3 nights at this hotel and had a wonderful stay. The staff was very nice and helpful. The room was very comfortable for our stay. The big plus is the location. Hard to beat the short walk to so many of the sights. I recommend this hotel for anyone who just uses their hotel as a base of operations to explore Florence. If you are looking for luxury the you are looking at the wrong hotel, but if you want a reasonable price and a nice stay...this is a great choice

<Content>Can't beat the location. We have just returned from a 3 night city break in Florence. I booked a family suite at the Pendini for my husband and I and our two children (21 and 18). We walked from the station and it took about 10mins. The location is its best feature. It's very easy to get to any of the major attractions (not that Florence is huge...most places are an easy walk)The entrance is just off the Piazza Della Republica, down a tiled corridor. The lift is tiny, but seviceable. Reception is on the 4th floor of this grand but tired building and service was friendly enough if you made the effort.Our suite was on the 3rd floor with windows into the courtyard, making it quite dark unless you opened the shutters fully. It was clean if a little dated and the rooms were serviced and fresh towels put out every day. (The towels were bright white, big and fluffy). There were two bedrooms and a shared bathroom.The beds were comfortable enough, although after a day of museums, gardens and piazzas, we could have slept on concrete! We did notice an odd smell in our room and couldn't track it down.The walls were a bit thin and you could hear the people in the adjoining suite when they were watching TV or laughing.The bathroom was large and clean, although the push button on the toilet was temperamental and my husband did some running repairs. There was also a strange smell in this room at times. The shower in the bath was good...plenty of hot water and fairly powerful, but the shower screen was very wobbly and had to be leant against the shelf to keep it from falling on the floor!Breakfast was taken in the room which is in the arch. It was ok...a couple of choices of cereal, sticky croissants (which were brought in fresh every day) breakfast rolls and various jams and 'dairylea/la vache qui rit' type cheese. There were some ham and cheese slices also, some fruit and yoghurt.Orange juice was from cartons but it was ok. Coffee,milk and hot water were from thermos jugs and there was a selection of tea bags. There was a wide range of people and nationalities who stayed here from students to families with young children, young couples to families like us with older children. Internet access was free...you just sign in and sign out.Overall the Pendini was fine for a short break.

<Content>Don't let them fool you If you do anything on your trip to Florence, do not stay at the Pendini. It was our worst experience on our trip to Italy. I am not one to write poorly about anything, however feel that it is my duty as a travelor to help save other travelers from making the same mistake we did by staying at the Pendini. There are so many better hotels in Florence.The staff, particularly Pamela and Barbara were extreemly rude and unhelpfull. Asking a question like,can you reccomend a place to eat would completely annoy them and they made us feel like we were asking them for the world. The breakfast was brutal, stale and very American and the walls are soooo thin, you can hear everything above below and all around you. Don't plan on having a good night sleep here because lots of young kids stay here due to the price and they keep the entire hotel awake. The hotel staff does not do anything about noise, they just brush it off. Do yourself a favor and look for a new hotel, this place ruined our trip to Florence.

<Content>Run down hotel. This hotel is definitely overrated. The first night we were there we were in a room that was near the elevator on the 4th floor (close to the receptionist). This was a terrible location because the whole night I could hear the front desk phone ringing and people getting on and off the elevator. The bed was also extremely uncomfortable and a bug actually bit me on my face in the night. I hardly slept at all and was very upset after 1 night stay. Also, the bathroom in the room smelled really bad and my bed was close to the door so that didn't help with the sleep factor.The front desk was able to switch me to a quieter room later that 2nd day on the 3rd floor (Room #120) which was much quieter than the first. This new room also had a renovated bathroom with a tub and a really nice shower. Needless to say I was MUCH happier with the new room.Overall, I was not impressed with this hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful but the rooms are not comfortable and the breakfast is average. It was nice having free internet access though to quickly check emails. When in Florence try out the restaurant Osteria Della Nonna or Trattoria Del Carmine...both are very good. Avoid the Osteria which is just north of Ponte Alle Grazie (not very good at all) and overpriced.

<Content>What can I say? It's okay-ish. Well, this would be a good place for young people, I think, say if you wanted your college age kids in a good location in a safe area near the major sites. You can walk from the train station, though it is quite a walk, so only with a carryon or rollalong bag and once you find it, a bit tricky as the huge sign faces the main square, but the entrance is off on a side street to left (if you are facing the sign.) Then it is up to the 4th floor in the world's smallest elevator. I just kept hoping there wouldn't be a power failure while I was in there! The management is friendly and the rooms are good sized, but I found both of mine (long story about a missing bathroom) dark and kinda grim. The bathroom was very clean. TV worked. I was in an inside room with less than no view (one bothered why there was a window at all.) AC worked. Long complicated walk to the breakfast room on another floor, but the breakfast was good. What can I say? For those who want a bit of glamour with their Italian holiday, this is not the place. For those who want a bed, a good location, and some funky Italian charm... it's fine; and very reasonable in price, as it should be.

<Content>A real family hotel A great family hotel right in the heart of Florence: a stone's throw from the Piazza Repubblica. It's a great rambling place occupying the fourth floor of what seems to have been a Florentine palace. We booked a suite and it was huge: must have been 800+ square ft. elegantly furnished, and clean. We were on the side away from the Paizza which meant peace and quiet.The service is great, a real family hotel. Reservations for the Accademia and Uffizi no problem and no charge. The breakfast was great. One drawback was the limited Internet availability (one terminal in the lobby) but the hotel was up front about it before we booked.

<Content>Wonderful Italian City Hotel Wonderful location and cheerful and extremely helpful staff. This was our first trip to Florence and the Pendini staff was more than happy to share information about directions, restaurants, best gelato places as well as answer any American questions we might have. The room was quite spacious for a European hotel and the breakfast more than adequate. Though some might have found our room over-looking the street a bit noisy, we loved going to sleep listening to Puccini being sung below. A real Italian experience! We'll definitely be back on our next Florence trip. Thanks to everyone connected to the Hotel Pendini.

<Content>YMMV, (your mileage may vary) Well I must say the hotel is central to the sites you'll want to visit in Florence, but... My wife and I stayed 2 nights, 2 different rooms. 1st nights room #206, faced the indoor roof line, (center of a square doughnut), room was of decent size, double bed, small 13 inch t.v. mounted high on the wall, hardwood floor, thin walls noise outside room came right in and I assume our noise carried back out. But the bad news for this hotel is the bathroom, ugh. Mold in the shower, walls grout etc... the worst was the shower curtain, looked like it hadn't been changed in years, moldy, water stained, inexcusable for an item that retails 5 euro or less. Complained that night to move, but no other rooms available, next morning we were ready to move to another hotel, but they then agreed to switch us to another room that was coming available in the afternoon. Room 202 faced Via Strozzi, so there was a bit of street noise from below, much better room, carpet on the floor, nice double bed, (actually 2 singles put together) - but again, the bathroom, no visible mold... but, you know the smell, this hotel has a problem, I suggest they fix it quickly. Our experience was with 2 different rooms. I would think you can find something better, we choose it out ot the Rick Steves Guide, I would hope he drops this place in the 2007 edition. Breakfast was standard European fare, staff was nice, friendly, air condition worked well in both rooms. But mold, just say no and pass on this place.

<Content>Great location, less than great hotel We stayed at the Pensione Pendini for 3 nights in June (E150). The best thing about the hotel was the central location. We were able to walk everywhere. (Accademia, Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio, Duomo, markets) .Local, outdoor nightlife was fun...be sure to head to the piazza by the Uffizi gallery or the Ponte Vecchio at night for music and people watching.The hotel itself was disappointing. It was dreary and weathered. The room size was small but average. The bathroom was very small. The shower was nearly impossible to use and unsafe. The breakfast room was large and pleasant and the food selection was typical and satisfying. We stayed in a room near the breakfast room and it was very noisy in the morning. The air conditioning was not sufficient during the heatwave that we experienced. The electical circuit blew each time I used the blow dryer.I would not recommend this hotel nor would I return on future visits.

<Content>GREAT LOCATION! This hotel is not easy to find, and DO NOT drive near the Uffizi or you will face the hefty fine. Once you find this hotel you will see that the location is stellar! The rooms are basic, but the views are great. We had a four person room that overlooked the center square. It was very easy to walk to and from the main city cites from the hotel. The staff is very helpful. In fact one lady recommended a restaurant for us, and it turned out to be one of the BEST meals we had in Italy! (Resturante Natalino) This is a basic hotel with a fabulous location.

<Content>Wonderful hotel Hotel Pendini is a wonderful hotel in the heart of the city and within walking distance of all the local museums. Having just stayed at a terrible hotel in the heart of Rome (avoid Hotel Abruzzi near the Pantheon), the Hotel Pendini in Florence was just terrific. The size of the room was a great surprise considering the location of the hotel (and compared to the small room in Rome). The staff at the hotel were wonderful and they helped to make reservations at the Ufizzi and the Academia (highly recommended to avoid standing in line for hours). The breakfast buffet is more than sufficient and there is also a computer with internet access near the front desk that is available for free. So without hesitation, I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>A wonderful place to stay I don't have much experience in European hotels, so I didn't know what to expect. But Hotel (Pensione) Pendini was a perfect place to begin our trip. The central location was a huge plus. The hotel is so charming, with beautiful woodwork. Our room was very warm and colorful, and overlooked the Piazza della Repubblica, which was lovely. Some people might not like the noise at night, but it didn't bother me. They weren't what I would consider annoying noises -- no car horns or sirens, nothing like that. Just people talking and laughing and having a good time.We had a double room with two single beds, and they were very comfortable. I'm picky about beds, but I slept like a rock. (Of course, that could be because of the exhaustion from walking around all day, but still.)I'd like to mention the excellent staff, who I think really make this a special place to stay. They were incredibly helpful and friendly, and forgave our terrible Italian and spoke very good English. We had some travel mishaps on our first day and didn't get to the hotel until almost 4 a.m., but someone was there to greet us and help us out, which was a tremendous relief after a heinous ordeal.Florence was our favorite part of Italy, and Pensione Pendini was a big reason. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.(Side note: If you stay there, you have to go to Festival del Gelato, at Via del Corso 75r, right off the Piazza Repubblica. It was by far my favorite in Florence.)

<Content>Hotel Pendini - great for families Stayed 3 nights at Hotel (Pensione) Pendini in Room 303 -- a large 2 room (+ nice BR)on third floor, next to another large room that join, so would be good for large families/small groups. The total footage of thet 2 rooms was probably around 550, which seems huge in Italy. The rooms are not 5 star, by any means, and my daughter fell over in a chair that broke, but the beds were comfortable (King in master, and 3 twins + sofa in front room). These 2 suites are the only rooms on the 3rd floor, have their own entrance, but just off of elevator (typical small one), and you walk up (or ride, if you can squeeze in) to 4th floor for a very nice breakfast. The rates were reasonable. The rooms on the 4th floor seemed to be singles, and not that big, but again, you're in Europe. The location is great. The staff is great -- the desk clerk even called around and told me where to get tickets to see Eros Ramizotti in concert! Free internet computer. This is an older building, and the entrance is a little funky, but if you get in the spirit, a wonderful place to stay.

<Content>Lovely place excellent service Just came back from Italy, the Pendini is one of the most nice experience we had. Great location nice rooms clean and well decorated. The bathroom was a little small compared to what we are used but was nice and clean. Excellent service. The staff at the desk both during the day and also at night was always friendly and helpful. Surely I will stay there next time.

<Content>Great location Our second stay at this hotel, which is located in Piazza Republica, right in the centre of Florence. It's just about the best spot in town for visiting all the sights.The hotel is comfortable, with good facilities, and helpful staff.However, rooms overlooking the road can be a bit noisy at night, so ask for a room overlooking the Piazza or inside.

At night, we were serenaded by the music from the plazza below, very charming and romantic. Some might want to bring earplugs. Staff friendly and helpful.

<Content>Pass on Pendini Our hotel room was small and there was an odor coming from the carpet. When I went to bed I realized that the top blanket was damp. The shower floor and tiles were black in spots. The curtains broke when I opened them. The walls are paper thin. I could hear everything from the hallway and other rooms. Unless you are completely desperate for a room, pass on this hotel.

<Content>Great Location We stayed for three nights and absolutely loved this hotel. It is on about the fourth floor of a building which overlooks one of the main squares. Rooms are very spacious with very high ceilings. Bathrooms are a bit small as is typical for our Italy experience but in no way a problem. It is within walking distance to everything in the main part of town. The breakfast room overlooks the street below and is a wonderful place to start your day of exploration. The hotel staff was very helpful and cheerful! We would definitely stay here again!!!

<Content>OK Hotel We stayed here for one night on our third trip to Florence, so we kind of knew what to expect. Pretty OK place - not the most modern, but fairly large room and decent air conditioning.The hotel is accessible by a small elevator from ground level.Staff was friendly and helpful. The location is excellent - you can't beat it. In Florence, you don't spend a lot of time in your hotel, so if you can get a good deal here, then jump on it.

<Content>Perfect Pendini I had to take ths opportunity to counter some of the negative reviews of the Pendini. The room in which I stayed was a good sized double with a huge bed, an immaculate (although slightly cramped) bath, air conditioning in perfect working order, and a giant double-glazed (and thus sound proof) window overlooking the busy via Strozzi. The breakfast was completely normal for continental European standards (breads, cereals, fruit, coffee, meat, cheese, juice, yogurt), although I have received boiled eggs at other Florentine hotels. We arrived at midnight and the man at the desk actually carried our bags to the room for us which, in my experience, is a rarity in any European hotel. The location is unsurpassed. I will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Not for Solo Travellers. My 3* single room was too small for 110 euros and the tiny attached bathroom had an odd smell. Apparently some of the double or triple rooms have good views of the Piazza, but unfortunately, those in single rooms have to settle for views of the central air well. Apart from the night receptionist, front desk-staff were brisk and not quite friendly.

<Content>Do Yourself a Favor: Don't Go This place bears no resemblence to the blurbs in many of the guidebooks. The bathroom was moldy, the linens worn and threadbare, the breakfast horrible. As for service, I didn't notice any. Yes, the location is good, but there are a lot of other hotels with good locations. There are no circumstances under which I would ever revisit the Pendini.

<Content>Great Stay We stayed 5 nights there and it was nothing like some of the reviews here say. We booked a regular room and got a free upgrade to a big room with a view to the beautiful piazza della republica. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We had capuccinos,cereals, juices, ham, cheese, bread, etc for breakfast and the location is awsome! There was some noise, so the only piece of advice here is to take your earplugs and not to book the rooms near the lobby. Other than that, the hotel was really a great deal and we will definetly stay there again.

<Content>Stay Somewhere Else With all the hotels available in Florence, the Pendini is not a good choice. The elevator from the lobby is creepy covered with graffitti and scratches. The rooms are inconsistent. We were begrudgingly shown 2 rooms and both were very small with inadequate bathrooms. For a 3 star hotel to have a hole in the floor for the shower is not acceptable. The public rooms have an old world charm, but the front desk has no charm at all. For our next 2 nights we happily moved to the Firenze which is better located, friendlier and much less expensive.
