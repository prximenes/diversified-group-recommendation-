<Content>Very satisfied with this hotel This hotel is conveniently located near the metro but we also enjoyed walking on the Gran Via down to the Prado and Sol areas. I agree that the hotel needs to soundproof their rooms more because I could hear clearly when guests close and open their doors. The air unit only gave out warm air, which was a bit annoying but not a major hassle. The room we stayed in was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was clean with plenty of towels. The staff members were very cordial and helpful. We had to check out very early and the concierge made sure that we had a taxi (which costs about 30 Euros to the airport). Overall, we were satisfied with the hotel and will definitely come back for a second stay.

<Content>Not quite happy Not quite happy, not quite gran, not quite 4 star.Hotel Versalles, 3*** - it would be more appropriate for me.But this is not the real issue, the place is basic but OK, it is not an old and dirty place - the hotel itself is fine. The real problems were: 1) Soundproofing- I don't know how they built this place, but, I swear, I have never been in a place where you hear a breath on the room beside. I was washing my teeth and I jumped: oh my god, someone entered into my room!! - of course, this was not the case, but I have travelled a bit and I have never seen such a place. 2) Heating: last week of December and I slept 4 nights with the window open!!! and there was nothing else I could do!! - again, i don't come from the north pole,I mean, it was not normal..Good points: - very good location close to the metro in a nice area and staff kind - I am afraid not enough to make me go back

<Content>Mixed feelings... Although the majority of the staff we encountered was helpful, some were not as willing to go beyond their call of duty. The use of the business centre is not free (which in my opinion it should be if you're staying at a 4* hotel), and the computer itself was ancient and slow. The room was small and cozy but we found hairs on our bed sheets which made us question the cleanliness of the place. The hallways had a funny smell too. The bathroom although small was clean so no major complaints there. The walls are paper thin so be sure to bring ear muffs. The hotel's location is not the best, but convenient enough for the metro stop Alonso Martinez which connects about 3 lines of the metro including #10 which takes you to Barajas Airport. The hotel is also close enough to La Chueca which was cool.

<Content>Great hotel, handy location I stayed 4 nights in the Gran Versalles. Its a lovely hotel. Our room was spotlessly clean. Staff were very friendly. Breakast was not included but was available for eur11 which is a bit steep considering whats available close by. Hotel is located across the road from Alonso Martinez Metro station - very handy location. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Very Good Madrid Hotel We stayed here on our trip for a couple of days after the New Years. This was an a very good hotel for the price. The beds were comfortable, but the rooms were kind of cramp (typical of european hotels). This is an older refurbished hotel with a clean bathroom. The carpet was a bit worn. Breakfast (11EU) was not included in our rate. Instead, we went across the street to a cafeteria there. It had very good food at reasonable prices. Since the hotel is located on a side street that is away from the very busy main street, it was very quiet. The hotel staff was friendly during check-in. The hotel is directly acorss the street from a metro stop. I would highly recommend this hotel to other travellers.

<Content>Good experience at Gran Versalles After much deliberation chose the Versalles for our four nights stay because of its location. Proved to be a very good choice. Central location in a quiet street with plenty of local atmosphere and restaurants very close. Hotel service was excellent, our room was on a 'no smoking' floor with no disturbances. I would certainly recommend this hotel.

<Content>I'm a regular! I go to Madrid about once a month for work and almost always stay here. It is in a great location, right in the centre, within walking distance of the shops and most tourist attractions, but on a quiet street (which is a real bonus in Madrid). It's not luxurious but it is reasonably priced and the rooms are quiet, clean and comfortable. One word of warning: avoid the hotel breakfast - it's better and cheaper to go to one of the numerous caf茅s nearby.

<Content>Quiet and friendly This was my second stay here. Once again the room was of a decent size and the bathroom was very clean.It is two minutes from Metro Alonso Martinez . If you come out of the Metro you will see a cafe on the junction , go straight across the pedestrain crossing and turn left. It is the first turning on the right,The cafe itself does a decent breakfast or try the Barbera restaurant on the other side of the road for some tasty seafoodOverll a good hotel away from the major hustle of the city

<Content>Loved It, Would Stay Again I was looking for a hotel in Madrid that was close to a Metro station and located in a safe and quiet neighborhood. I found both with this wonderful hotel. The hotel was business like and a joy to stay in. The Metro was right down the street and the neighborhood was gorgeous. The staff was courteous at check in and check out. The hotel is not flashy but not a drag to stay in either. The room was about average size for Europe, AC worked, and the room service was quick and painless.The only two reasons I did not rate this hotel as excellent was because of their lack of complimentary breakfast and the room's thin walls. The breakfast was downright expensive with a price of 10 euros per person. The thin walls didn't bother me until we had our neighbor jabbering throughout the whole night one of our nights there. Other than that I loved it and would most definately stay there if visiting Madrid again. I'll just make sure to find breakfast elsewhere next time.

<Content>Quiet yet fairly central Lovely hotel in central location. Less than 5 minutes walk to the nearest metro station and from there the whole city is accessible. Alternatively you can walk to some very lively spots with great bars and nightlife. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. The room was good and clean with a very comfortable bed. Very little noise in this area of the city so we had no problems getting a good nights sleep. Would definitely use this hotel again.

<Content>Good, clean, excellent location Hotel is alomst exactly what I want from a central major city hotel.Firstly, the hotel is in very good condition. It has a more business like feel to it, which generally means its clean and well kept, which was true. Not for those that like 'character'. Only odd downside was that one side of hotel had no direct lift access from reception (you had to climb 15 stairs with suitcase before a lift??). Very Odd. Also roadside was down 5 steps (not great place for handicapped people).Location was great. 25 mins walk to Puerto del Sol is no problem for me. But it means its in a nice neighbourhood, very quiet, but with local bars and restaurants (and Starbucks/Steakhouse for those days when you want home!).Its very easy to get from here to anywhere, especially the sights like Prado. And metro right around the corner.Amenities in hotel aren't top for this price (hence only 4 stars). There is no late night bar (11pm) and its very small and smoky. Not sure there is a separate breakfast place either (personally never do hotel breakfasts). There are plenty of very close local late bars so not a major issue, but at this price/level this should be included in my opinion. Room service food good, but strange menu (many main meals, few 'hotel' type snacks.Service at front desk good. One guy was not particularly helpful, but all the others were very nice. Booking restaurants for us no problem. AND the room had a Madrid 'Style' book listing many restaurants and sights which was excellent.Overall, very happy with experience and would use again if I went back.

<Content>Great service, but the amenities could improve I went in with caution after reading the earlier reviews here.1. The location and service are great. Kudos to the reception desk. They were always helpful and smiling !!The place is very silent too. No more construction. 2. The amenities are OK. It compares to any motel chain in usa. Simple things like Coffee maker and toiletries like body lotion were absent. And oh the cable service sucks. Personally I prefer to stay at Senator Gran via if i had a chance for an extra 20 dollars but, for the price this place is not that bad

<Content>noisy, noisy There was construction going on just outside my window and it was very noisy.When I checked out, the staff accused me of trying to skimp on minibar purchases. They claimed there was a half-drunk, open bottle of beer in the room when there wasn't. I found them very rude and disrespectful.

<Content>Ok, but some significant failings I booked this hotel due to the positive reviews posted on this site but have to say that not all was as expected. On the whole i found the hotel to be less than average. I travelled to Madrid with my wife and baby daughter (10mths) during July. This happened to coincide with one of the hottest weekends with temperatures being well over the 40C range around midday. However the hotel does not have an ice machine. In order to get Ice you had to pop down to the Bar or restaurant and ask for ice which was generally provided in a plastic carrier bag! This wouldnt have been too much of an issue had it not been for the fact that although the rooms had air conditioning, it was clearly not strong enough to cool the whole room. My daughter struggled to sleep in the heat and had a number of restless nights. We even noticed that the air con was turned off during some hours (though usually when most guest were out sight seeing).Other problems we experienced were: - The hotel is undergoung some renovations and so building work could be heard early in the mornings (around 8am) - We could only receive 9 of the 16 tv channels. The staff claimed that they only offered 9 channels when clearly the in room literature stated 16 channels. - The room had a weird smell to it when you first entered. We did ask to move rooms but there werent any available. - The bathrooms must have had very thin walls as you could hear what the people in the neighbouring rooms were up to (it was not pleaant!)It wasnt all bad though. Positives included: - Good location. Within walking distance to some of the key sites. A Burger King, Pizza Hut and Subway within walking distance if your stomach cannot handle the local delicacies. - Only a few hundred yards to the nearest underground subway/metro - Staff were very friendly and helpful.In summary, its a hotel that has a lot going for it, but sadly let us down in too many ways and we wont be staying there if we ever return to Madrid.

<Content>Clean, Quiet, basic The hotel is in an OK location. About a 20 minute walk from most attractions (Museums, palace, cathedrals) and one block away from a Metro station. There is construction next door, but I heard nothing.The room was clean, but the room was hot (temprature) even though I turned the heat off. I had to keep the window open to moderate the temprature. There sometimes was also an odd smell coming from the bathroom, kind of a sewer-ish oder. Never quite figured that out.Room was an ok at 90 Euro.50-50 as to going back. I also stayed at the Confortel Madrid Suites. 2 room suite (bedroom, living room) for $90 (US dollars). Further out of town so walking around town is out of the question, but the Metro station is less than 50 meters away. I would go back there.

<Content>Hotel Reviews are accurate except for construction noise Stayed at the Gran Versalles beginning Dec 12 for six nights. The location is good via the subway (50 yards). Staying in the Sol or Gran Via area would have been much more convenient and but probably more costly (excellent subway system).The room was very clean with good service throughout. We were able to check in by mid morning. The room was very warm at times as a little bit of heat was still being generated even though the thermostat was off.The major complaint is the construction project precisely next door. Continued loud noise from 8am through 6pm. The construction has been ongoing for months. The hotel should post a warning of this construction noise on its web site.

<Content>One of Madrid's best hotels Hopefully this review will push this hotel up the charts a bit more, as it was well worth it. We came here on an Expedia deal (the first time I used them) for 2 nights @ 150 euros and found it to be well worth the money. As folks pointed out before about the helpful staff, we found them to be helpful beyond the call. The porter, who gave us advice about a club we were visiting and who also made phonecalls to make sure it was open, the very friendly front desk gentlemen who gave you the feeling they were happy you chose their hotel and even correcting a spelling mistake on our postcards! The location is fantastic - the Alonso Martinez metro station is a great hub for going anywhere in the city and we were a short walk away from the Plaza Colon and the Paseo De La Castelleano, where the 12 October parade was being held (The Hard Rock Cafe is also there and a few minutes more walking and you're in the shops arround Serrano and Goya stations). If you want a hotel, this is the one you have to choose.

<Content>Clean and cool in the hot city The four stars are really for the spotlessness of not only the rooms but of the Hotel itself.Our room was adequate.It overlooked what seemed like a backyard and there was not much cupboard space , even for us who travel lightly. The TV had also terrible reception.Having said all that, the staff were helpful and always let us in when the doors were locked in the early hours .It is in a quiet , safe area and two minutes from the Alfonso - Martinez Metro.From here if you go down the hill / slope there are a couple of lovely bars, one being the Cervezera Santa Barbara ( or something similar )Overall , a good decent hotel

The hotel is well located within 10-15 minutes walk of most of the major attractions but in a quiet area next to a metro station. The staff were friendly and always helpful. A real find.

<Content>Lovely hotel. The Gran Versalles is a lovely hotel just off the main road with little traffic passing so not too much noise to deal with (besides Spanish taxi drivers at the front of the building). The hotel is adequately located just away from the major tourist attractions but this is not a problem as the Metro system in Madrid is top class and will get you anywhere you want to go easily and cheaply. The rooms were clean and nicely put together (the maid who cleaned our room every day was hot aswell!). The staff were very helpful and spoke very good English so no hassle checking-in or answering our queries. My only gripe is the bar. It was very small and very very standard. But atleast it was clean and the barman was very polite and friendly and saw to all our alcoholic needs.

<Content>Everything we could have asked for My mother and I stayed in this hotel for a week during a vacation to Madrid. The staff was very accomodating. After checking in, the staff remembered our names and greeted us like friends every time we entered or left the hotel. We were quite impressed with this as the hotel was sold out most of the nights we were there. We went to Barcelona for two nights and only wanted to take over night bags and the hotel was more than happy to store our bags for us 'til we returned to Madrid. Our room was very very clean when we arrived and was well cleaned every day. As other reviewers mentioned, the walls were thin and we were right by the elevator so we were aware that people we around us but by no means was the noise disturbing to our stay. I would stay here again on another trip to Madrid.

<Content>Tucked away My wife and I were very satisfied with our stay. We arrived jet lagged and found the staff helpful and responsive. Breakfast had a nice spread of hot and cold foods. We had a French Tour group staying with us so the dinning area was packed. We did the European thing, asked if we could join someones table. (This is appalling to Americans) The Hotel is very safe inside as outside walking home at Midnight. We didn't bother with the Metro even though we had a stop close by. You can walk to most places of interst without fanfare. I use crutches by the way...... We did take a cab on suggestion of the Hotel to a Bus station and it was reasonable 5 Euro cross town. Within 8 city blocks we had a Tony Roma's, Hard Rock Cafe, Sub Way and Burger King. For some this can be handy since the Spanards eat late. Tony Roma's for example closes at 2 PM and opens back up at 8:30PM. We ate the local food which is excellent. I would stay in this Hotel again.

<Content>Nice centrally located hotel Nice hotel, centrally located about 50-100 metres from Alonso Martinez Metro. Rooms brightly decorated but rather warm (in Feb) air-con didn't seem to be working. Evening bar rather impersonal, very bright lights but tapas served with the drinks. Friendly staff. Overall very good value for money would definitely consider staying there again if in Madrid
