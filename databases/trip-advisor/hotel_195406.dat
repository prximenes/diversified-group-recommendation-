<Content>Great location but noisy room I stayed here two nights on a business trip and, warned by previous reviews on Trip Advisor, asked for a room on a floor well away from street level noise. Unfortunately my room was just below the breakfast room and I was awoken very early each morning with chairs being scraped across the floor above. The staff were also very noisy in the corridors and were even hoovering the corridor at 8 am in the morning (surely no hotel should need to do this!) So this is not a hotel to choose if you like to lie in in the morning. However, the room itself was very smart, bright and charming and the reception staff were also very charming (perhaps they sacked the last lot cos of comments on Trip Advisor!) However, there was a rather unpleasant smell in reception which I couldn't (and didn't really want to) place... The location of the hotel can't be faulted but, overall, next time I'd try another central hotel.

<Content>Not so Grand Cavour Price was right, location to most museums was perfect. Most of the desl staff is a bit unwilling to extend any energy into engage with the customer.We stayed 4 nights, the night before we left was the worst I have ever expereinced. The hotel neglects to warn you that they share a courtyard with private apartments. It was a Friday and loud, very loud music was echoing up the courtyard to prolbably the entire hotel. I could hear it in the halls!I called to complain,but the staff was unwilling to take any action to get the noise to stop. They offered to move us, but that wouldn't have made any difference.I asked to speak to the manager, and the young woman at the desk said that she went home and that it would help because we were checking out in the morning before the manger would be back.There are more reasons not to stay than to decide to stay, but this one event is enough.

<Content>Very good time in this hotel. I spent one night in the hotel in my first visit to Florence. The hotel has a great location, just steps from the most important atractions. The room was renewed, clean and with elegant and classic furniture. The beds are excellent and breakfast superb. The only thing i didn't like was the reception desk attendants. They don't really make any effort to give you any help.

<Content>Excellent Location We were on a tour group and I specifically picked the date of this tour so we could stay at the centrally located Cavour. It is a fantastic location. The room we got was extremely nice, however, smelled of paint, toilet didn't work and shower was broken. We did have a lovely corner room which gave us 2 windows, however, it was extremely loud with street noise, cars, street cleaners, etc, louder than anything I have ever heard due to being on the 1st floor in the front facing the street. We were going to ask to be moved, however, we didn't know what we would get so we stayed. I never slept. Since it was only 1 more night we were staying, we just kept the same room. They fixed the toilet and shower, but the noise was aweful, albeit, lesser than the night before. The breakfast was worse I have ever seen and I usually don't complain about the breakfasts since I have travelled alot and have been on many tours. I usually find something I like. I just had tea both days with a roll and butter. Terrible breakfst. It is a shame they cannot do something about the noise and breakfast, because the hotel is pretty nice and you cannot get a better location.

<Content>Nice, Convenient Florence Hotel The Hotel Cavour was perfect for a visit to Florence. It was a good price and conveniently located. Their breakfast was great, our room was modern and clean, and looked like it had been recently rehabbed.

<Content>Unfriendly staff We stayed in the Grand Hotel Cavour for two nights during a trip to Tuscany. Although the lobby was very attractive, our inital impressions were poor. The doors were difficult to go through with luggage and no one offered to help. The reception staff were unhelpful, unfriendly and rude on occasions. We dropped off our luggage and returned to the hotel to check in at the correct time. We were informed our luggage would be brought to our room and were told breakfast was on the sixth floor. On arrival to our room, the maid was finishing our room - however had put the cleaning products on the bed which had leaked - meaning the bed had to be changed while we were waiting. It then took 45 mins and a phonecall to get our luggage brought up (no apology). Although the room was nice, it was very small and I would not have called it a superior room. On discussion with the staff they reassured me it was a superior room and kept saying 'do you not like the room?' but nothing else. Checking the website on return home the room did not meet the standards listed for a superior room.The room although small was nicely decorated and clean, as was the bathroom. The location of the hotel was excellent.The breakfast was disappointing in comparison to the other hotel we stayed in during our trip. There was no mention of the roof terrace, the room was overcrowded, ran out of hot water for tea and there was no fresh fruit - only tinned and dried fruit. In summary, the hotel was nice and in a good location but did not meet our expectations. The unfriendly staff were the main reason we did not enjoy our stay - ending with the reception staff during checkout asking us three times in a row are you sure you took nothing from the minibar? while we tried to convince them we hadn't. I wouldn't recommend this hotel as a 4* although with friendlier staff I'm sure I would.

<Content>Started off ok and then got worse My girlfriend and I stayed at the Grand Hotel Cavour for three nights in August and from the web site pictures we both thought that we had chosen the right hotel for our stay in Florence. After arriving and having to haul three suit cases across Florence as we were told that the hotel was close (Walking distance) from the train station it was a god 15 to 20 minutes away. Once we finally got there and walked through the doors we were both plesantly surprised to walk in to a rather grand and very air conditioned enterance/receiption area, we were greeted by a very helpful lady on the receiption desk who explained that the roof terrace was being painted but would be open the next day and the rest of the info about the hotel we were then shown our room which was nice double bed, air con, mini bar and a rather great looking bathroom. Although the room was nice we soon noticed that the air con wasn't all it was cracked up to be as even though it was on full blast there didn't really seem to be any air blowing in to the room as I think that most of it was being pumped to reception area downstairs. It being extremely hot in Florence I decided to have a shower to find the shower head was attached to the wall but at knee height which meant if you wanted a shower your had to sit down in a very narrow bath and basically get water everywhere.The hotel in fairness could not be positioned any better it is only a few hundred yards away from the Duomo and a five minute walk from the Ufizi so went spent the day sightseeing to come back to the hotel find a new person behind the reception desk who I felt was most of the most unhelpful people I have ever come across (whether he was having a bad day I don't know) but when I asked him a couple of questions about if the bar was going to open the reply was 'no' and no explenation why it was closed I asked if could have a price list for the mini bar as there wasn't one in the room I got the same reply 'no' so I asked if he could let me know what the prices were and he only gave me two for water and coke, both these prices were not the ones I wanted anyway, so in the end I gave up as he was just not interested in what I had to say not what you really expect for service at a so called four star hotel.... the icing on the cake for me was on our last morning at about 5am I was awoken by a really bad smell of sewage in our room which I thought was strange as I hardly thought that the drains could have backed up due to the fact we were on the 6th floor but it was truely unpleasent but no one could tell me what it was but thinking about I don't think I wanted to know anyway..... our time in florence was great the city is amazing but the only sour point was the hotel I would say that the enterance/reception area is four star but the rest of the hotel is lacking a long way behind as in another review 2.5 stars at the most. We will go back to Florence but I don''t think we will be staying at the Grand (that's a joke) hotel Cavour again.The yoghurt for breakfast was nice though

<Content>This is not a 4 star hotel...maybe 2 star at best I am very surprised about all the reviews I've read. We arrived on our honeymoon last week to find two separate twin beds even though we had booked a double. When we asked to change rooms or fix the bed they said no that they were booked and that the chamber maid had gone home. (who was cleaning the room next to ours) When I pointed that out they then said that she was too busy to help us and we would have to wait until the following day. We pointed out that our booking instructions had said HONEYMOON and they still didn't care. We were then finally moved to a room that had black carpeting (from dirt) that was meant to be beige, a TV with no plug and about 1 inch of dirt on everything. After much complaining we were finally moved to a room that was clean with the twin beds pushed together. I'm still not sure why they just didn't move us there in the first place. We weren't asking for an upgrade. Just wanted what we booked and were treated as if we were asking for too much. This hotel was 1/4 full at best and everything was shut including the restaurant and laundry service.The only thing I liked about this place was the lobby, the coffee in the morning and the location. The breakfast was pathetic.Note that this is from a couple who have traveled for over 10 years together. We've only asked to change rooms one other time due to the fact a construction site outside our window was knocking the pictures onto the bed at 6 am while we were sleeping. Such a shame because the website looked so nice.

<Content>Super hotel, great location Requested a quiet room on high floor and got up graded to a deluxe room on the 5th floor. No view but room and bathroom facilities were superb. Hotel in perfect location for walking to any of the major tourist spots and restaurants. Lovely roof terrace with great views over the city both day and night time, the breakfast was the best we have had in Italy and reception staff very helpful especially with driving routes out and into the city! Would recommend this hotel and would certainly use it again.

<Content>Disorganised front desk The hotel is in a great place, but you cant get there with your car. The garage they used crashed our car costing us éˆ§?00 in damages. They were confused when checking us in (was it the right room or not?) and again when checking us out. Their recommendations for restaurant were sub-par. The hotel, though decorated nicely, was a disappointment as we booked a double and got twin beds. Not nice for a first anniversary getaway. We'll head back to the Savoy on our next trip.

<Content>Grand Cavour was grand enough for us Very patient staff helped us finalize our choice of room. Extremely comfortable room: clean, cool, spacious, well appointed and comfortable..large bathroom and lovely extra sitting/dressing room with day bed. Across from elevator was not the problem we anticipated. Breakfast room very pleasant and roof top terrace did not disappoint, the main reason we selected this hotel from the start. Duomo view!!!Main day desk gentleman ( never got his name) was very helpful to us with advice for day train trip to Siena and booked us for a dinner theater experience in Florence that we will remember as a highlight of our trip. Last evening in Florence one of the women at the desk recommended a terrific restaurant where we had a fabulous meal, Boccanegra, Via Ghibellina, 124/RVery central location to all our wanderings and meanderings in Florence-- stayed four nights. Great spot. Very nice hotel.

<Content>needs improvement I always try to look for the good in any experience. Here are the good points to the Grand Cavour: It is in a great location and an easy walk to all major attractions, the lobby is beautiful, the toiletries were nice, and the breakfast was the best of any of the hotels we stayed in during our trip to Italy.Now for the other side: We may have just had bad luck, but this was our experience with this hotel. The room was shabby. The closet door stuck. Every drawer in the room (closet, desk, and bedside tables) was warpped and therefore difficult to open). The vent to the AC rattled terribly. Management did nothing to fix it. My husband eventually fixed it himself. Florence is a lively city. We could hear tons of noise with the AC on but alot more when we tried to leave it off. Housekeeping entered the room without giving us a chance to answer the door at 8:00 am. There was a service stairwell across from our room. The stairwell had no door. It was an unattractive cement sight and the food and trash smells coming out of it we very unpleasant. The shower dripped and the toilet ran some (we did not even try to have management fix these issues.) Overall, I wanted to like this hotel but just did not.

<Content>Fabulous location / great hotel What a fabulous place to stay - located very close to the cathedral in the old area of the city and within walking distance to lots of attractions and a great location to shop. The hotel was excellent , a very good 4 star hotel. Our room was very clean and comfortable, the staff were very polite and helpful and the breakfast was good. There are lots of places to eat nearby and you don't have to spend a lot on food. Would stay here again and have already told friends about this hotel and its great location.

<Content>Florence in the rain My husband and I stayed at the Cavour for 2 nights in September. Overall it was a good experience other than the bathroom. The showers in the room are not as you would expect. There is a large narrow tub with a hand held shower mounted on the side of the tub about midway between top of tub and the ceiling. There is a movable glass barrier that is suppossed to prevent you from getting the entire bathroom wet. I wish I had taken a picture for a better explanation. I have a very bad back and it was a bad situation for me. I ended up sitting in the tub to wash my hair etc but the tubs are hard to get in and out of as no handles etc. When I asked about changing rooms because of the bathroom I was told all the bathrooms were the same unless I wanted to go into a single room with a standup shower and no tub. I looked at the room but it was 1/2 the size of the first room so we stayed in our original room and the bathroom was soaked every morning. It rained the entire time we were in Florence but we still had a great time. The hotel has an excellent location. Close to all the galleries, Dumo and shopping. We walked everywhere without any difficulty. The staff was friendly but not like other hotels we stayed in through our tour. We had a corner room on the 3rd floor so it was great to have 2 windows but it is very loud at night . The rooms are equipped with extra shutters to close over the windows so this took care of much of the noise. They provide turn down service with fresh towels each evening. Breakfast was great every morning with the best coffee. Did not get up to the terrace because of the rain. I probably would not stay here again only becasue of the shower situation but if this situation does not bother you go for it!!!

<Content>Love the location and everything about this place! We stayed in Florence for three nights and loved every minute of it. The hotel staff is wonderful. We arrived at 8:30am so our room was not ready. They offered to care for our luggage so we went out and enjoyed ourselves and did not return until late afternoon. We had booked a honeymoon package so we had a bottle of champagne and a basket of fruit in the room. That was a very nice touch. None of the other hotels had that option. The room was very nice, spacious and very clean. The shower was wonderful and excellent size. The staff was very friendly. They printed things for us from the internet and were always friendly and willing to help. We felt the sincerity in their words. The hotel has a very nice breakfast that was delicious and very complete. Our room faced the front so we heard some street noise since it's a busy street but nothing that would prevent us from sleeping or that would wake us up. So we didnt think that was an issue. The lobby is spacious and very nicely decorated. The location is excellent. Only two blocks from the Duomo and very close walk to the Ponte Vechio. You could walk everywhere and not have to take a taxi. The only day we did take a taxi was to arrive and leave since we did not want to drag our luggage through the streets. We highly recommend it and would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Great location We spent two nights in Florence. The hotel is a short taxi ride from the train station. The staff is very friendly. Our rooms were not ready so they offered their breakfast buffet. They have a wide variety of food. The view from the terrace is great. In Florence, you can walk anywhere. The hotel is in the middle of everything. The Bargello Musuem is one block away. The Accademia and Uffizi are short walks. We reserved our tickets before we left for Florence for those three museums, which I highly recommend (there were three hour waiting in lines for some of the museums). The staff was great, very helpful. We ate at the restaurant in the hotel, I do not recommend it. There is a cafe next door that is fabulous. They re-open for dinner at 7 p.m. and get busy fast. The Duomo is a short walk away from the hotel. The only problem I had was that the room was not sound proofed. We could hear people in other rooms and on the street (we were on the first floor). The room we had was for a handicapped person, so the room was large, The bathroom was huge.

<Content>Nice lobby so so everything else The lobby was lovely old world and the girl at the desk was very helpful. It was very warm for October and there was no airconditioning. We were told it was against the law to run the air conditioner in October in Florence no matter that it was 80 degrees. Room was very small and the street noises were bad. We had to make a choice at night between being too warm in the room or have some outside air and lots of noise. Pick your poison. The breakfast was only so so. In all it was clean but nothing spectacular.

<Content>modern rooms, amazing location We stayed at Grand Hotel Cavour for 2 nights during our honeymoon in October. The best thing about this hotel is the location. Florence is not a large city, so you can walk almost everywhere, but this hotel is literally in the middle of everything. A few steps from the Duomo, Santa Croce, and even the Uffizi Gallery. The staff at the front desk were very helpful in showing us where to go on the map, but I would try to find restaurants on your own (they only had 2 recommendations). The rooms were very modern with brand new bathrooms. I am VERY picky about cleanliness, and the hotel was perfect. The only downside is the small size of the rooms (which is common in Europe), but when in Florence you don't spend much time there anyway.

<Content>Great Location and Beautiful Hotel This is definitely a 4+ star hotel (the European version of 3 and 4 start can vary widely!).The lobby is beautiful with a lot of marble and dramatic arched ceilings. The staff was very friendly (thank you to Alicia for the reservations, maps, and friendly smile). The room was very clean with triple pane sound proof windows and interior full coverage wooden shutters that make mid-day = midnight. The room was spacious by EU standards and so were the ones we could see in while they were being cleaned. The biggest / only complaint was that neither the non-smoking floors or the non-smoking rooms have ANY signs that say so. There is literally no way to know that you are on a non-smoking floor or in a non-smoking room....consequently people were filling our floor (the 5th) with smoke for three days.The breakfast (from 7 to 10:30) is incredible with a dedicated 6th floor room with dramatic lamps, floors, and white table clothes and is really a full breakfast.The view from the top floor terrace is beautiful in the day or night with a direct view of the Duomo dome and top of the church, also you can see many other sites around the city. The location is very central ~ 3 blocks from the Duomo (between the Duomo and the Uffitzi sp? Museum) right off the main shopping streets.

<Content>Great Location!!!! We stayed in this hotel on our August trip to Italy. The location was perfect! It was in the center of everything. Close to shopping, the Duomo, and tons of restaurants. The rooms were spacious and clean. The airconditioning was kept at a very comfortable level. The breakfast was so-so, but each morning we carried our trays upstairs to the rooftop dining area and enjoyed the view of the city. When we climbed the Duomo we saw our table from the top! There is a cafe accross the street that is open late, so we would stop in on our way home and take a tiramisu home with us!

Could walk to anything around very quickly.The free breakfast was pretty weak selectionwise and the service was almost non-existent, but otherwise we had a great experience here.

<Content>Don't forget anything at checkout time!!! I took my 3 grandchildren (16,19,21) for a trip of a lifetime.We stayed at this hotel two days and loved the hotel. The staff was not too friendly.We checked out and took the train to Rome. At that time my 16 year old remembered that he left a white envelope with $700 and 200 euros on the bed. When we got to Rome, we called and they said call back in 5 minutes. We called back and they didn't find the money. This incident put a damper on the rest of the trip.

<Content>Nice Surprse We were sent here after the hotel we booked was full. We required a quad room as a family traveling with two children. The Quad room at the Hotel Cavour was generous in size (not our usual experince in Italy) and appeared to be newly renovated. Others have complained about the noise our room was on an airshaft so noise was not an issue but surprisingly neither was light. The fourth floor room got enough light and even some direct sunlight that it never felt dark or closed in. The only issue was that the bathroom did not have a tub. After a long day of touring it would have been nice to soak in the tub. However the shower was wonderful with a rain shower head. This hotel was a wonderful surprise and I would recommend it to a family traveling with children.

<Content>Good Location at the Cavour The hotel was in a great location - steps away from the Duomo. Our room was okay. the bathroom was very old. the toilet ran all the time (unless we jiggled the handle) and the shower was horrible. Also, our room was VERY loud (though I don't think all rooms would have this problem). We were on the 2nd floor with a balcony overlooking a very busy street. 5:30am every morning a truck went by. I'd definately recommend requesting an inside room at this hotel.The breakfast and the hotel restaurant were really good!Front desk people didn't offer any assistance with tours or anything though they did give us a map.

<Content>An Ok Hotel We stayed here on our CIE Tour. The hotel is in a good location, convenient to most of the popular sites. However, it is still a very noisy part of town and most everyone in our tour group was kept awake by party goers and seranades most of the night.Our room was large and the bathroom ok. It only had a hand held shower and it was very difficult to manuever around in the tub without spaying water everywhere. I still don't understand why European tubs are so tall..it is hard for someone short to get in and out of them. If I ever go back to Florence, I would seek out a hotel in a quieter section of the city.Our continental breakfast was fine and the staff was very helpful here too.

<Content>OK rooms; extremely noisy hotel. Wouldn't stay again. We stayed in one of the hotel's Deluxe rooms over Easter. The room was modern, clean and comfortable, although I believe there are better value for money options available. One thing this hotel forget to install was double-glazing on its windows. Our 4th floor room absorbed all the noise from the drunken students and people smoking outside the hotel bar below well into the morning. After 3 night staying here I was glad to get home for a good night's sleep. The hotel also didn't get our In-room breakfast service right on any of the three mornings during our stay.

<Content>Great hotel We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and wish it had been more. Our room couldn't have been more perfect. It looked like it had been recently remodeled so I'm not sure if all the rooms are as nice. The room and bathroom were the cleanest I've seen at a hotel. The bed and bedding were comfortable and very clean. The bathroom was spacious and beautiful. The location of the hotel was perfect too. For this price I can't imagine a person could do better.

<Content>Great hotel! I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in October 2006. I must say I was a bit apprehensive, considering all of these negative reviews. My party booked 2 rooms, and though they were on 2 different floors, and were very different rooms, both were wonderfully sufficient for our needs. Both had newly renovated bathrooms. One room had a large tub and the other had a stand up shower. The rooms were, I felt, rather large for Europe and were very well appointed. We found our bed to be very comfortable. We had no problems with noise.The only mishap we had was that for some reason my parents were denied the included breakfast one morning. The waitress apparently had them confused as part of a tour group that was eating separately on the ground floor. Once I asked the hotel desk what had happened, they were apologetic stating that this was a mistake. They also sent a bottle of wine to our room as well as a second bottle of wine to my parents' room by way of apology. The hotel is ideally situated for a stay in Florence. It is very near the Duomo and many other sights are in easy walking distance. I would definitely stay in this hotel again.

<Content>What a wonderful hotel - Great location, great room, great staff Having read the previous reviews of this hotel I was not looking forward to our stay. I could not have been more wrong. This hotel has obviously been updated very recently and I would assume that some of the standard rooms are still undergong work. However, we had a deluxe room which was beautiful. Light, airy and newly renovated. The staff were extremely helpful when we arrived and throughout our stay. The location is just THE BEST! You are 2 mins walk from everything. My only comment was that breakfast was somewhat disappointing - very ulk standard hotel contiental breakfast, but it was all fresh.Having worked in hotels for over 20 years I realised that this hotel was being used by a well known American tour company - unfortunately these companies tend to pay very little for their rooms (not the guests who see a price that has been marked up several times) and this has probably led to these tour guests being given the standard rooms and hence the negative comments. As a private traveller we had a great time and will definitely be returning to this great hotel in a great city.

<Content>Be careful with Reservations The Hotel Staff is totally useless. They don't care about reservations and/or cancellations. They mix everything up and do not fulfill their promises. If they had a business in the US, they would be either in jail or bankrupt.

<Content>you will get much better room if you can pay a bit more!!! we have booked this hotel for a short trip (1 night). Firstly, we have a reservation for standard room but when we read the review of the one below, we are frightening and immediately change the room to the superior room. Eventhough it is not the same one as the hotel website but it is nicer compare to the standard room.If you can pay a bit more and ask for the new wing, it will be fine. Location wise , it is fantastic as near every museums,shops and restaurants.

<Content>Great Location but the rooms are nothing like pictured on the web-site I booked into this hotel over the New Year period having liked the location it was in (which is excellent) and from the pictures on the hotels own web-site showing clean comfortable rooms with modern bathrooms and the decor in a cream/beige contempary style. It looked perfect!however upon our arrival things were very different, we checked in and the reception staff were friendly and helpful, although the lobby did have an aroma of untreated sewage about it. As our room was not ready we had a walk around Florence for around an hour before going back to the hotel to have a rest in our room prior to going out in the evening. Upon getting to the room and opening the door I was shocked, disappointed and very upset to see the room did not even slightly resemble the rooms pictured upon their web-site, instead of cool sophisticated contempary room with limestone bathrooms I was greeted with a seedy looking dark red highly patterned carpet, old fashioned furniture, walls which were bashed, marked and battered and a bed which had lets just say definately seen better days. I then went into the bathroom which was covered in turquoise tiles with the customary grubby grout one would expect from a bathroom as dated and worn out as this. The room felt seedy and the clealiness was not to the standard I would expect with large amounts of dust upon the skirting boards.I immediately rang down to the reception and expalined this was not the room I had booked from looking upon their web-site, they explained that the room on the website was a deluxe room and as I had booked a standard rooms this was it. To cut a very long story short, which would mean descibing all details and conversations i had with the extremely unhelpful man (not the Manager as apparantly they did not have anyone in the hotel for the next 2 days who was Management), this hotel only has 25-30 rooms out of the 109 rooms which have been refurbished and the hotel does not seem to feel there is anything misleading or wrong by not pointing this out or even picturing the standard rooms upon their website, they were dishonest, lied and incredibly unhelpful. We were told that if we checked out we would be charged 180 euros for our first night, I informed them they were not to do this as we had been sold something completely different to what we received (it remains to be seen if they do charge us) I asked if they could assist in finding us another hotel room as they could not provide us with what was sold and i was unprepared to sleep in a room that was not as clean as it should be, they lied and said they had tried all the city hotels and they were full (it was New years eve). In the end I went to reception and demanded the local telephone directory and called the Gallery Art Hotel and was told they had availabilty. We checked out and for an extra 12 euros per night stayed in a hotel which was fabulous, with polite, helpful charming staff set in a clean contempary setting as I'd hope the Grand hotel Cavour would be.Think very carefully if you book this hotel,it has nothing going for it other than the location.

<Content>Loved the location The location for this hotel was great. The room we had was very large but the street noise was bad when trying to sleep. For the price the hotel was sufficient. We had an older room and the bathroom layout was awful. Not much space and when you took a shower water would spray outside into the room. Also I didn't see any bugs but got a few bites.

<Content>Fine and practical for visiting Florence For a 3-star hotel, which is its local rating, even though our travel agency listed it as 4-star, the Cavour is fine. The room they had reserved for us had been recently remodeled. Unfortunately, it was dark, being on the 3rd floor on a narrow street (we had requested a quiet room). The newly modeled bathroom must have been designed by an engineer concerned more with aesthetics than comfort. Anyway, we asked for a brighter room and switched to the 5th floor on day 2. There the room was older but comfortable, still on the same narrow street but with a great view of the Bargello and the Palazzo Vechio over the nearby roofs. The bathroom was small but practical. Small but good shower. The beds were slightly less firm than in the first room but acceptable. Breakfast was not very interesting. In both rooms, the electrical lighting was insufficient. The best thing about the Cavour is its location, between the Duomo and the Piazza della Signoria.

<Content>Would definately stay here again But would bring bug spray for the mosquitos. Our room was in the old wing, but the room was, by far, the largest on our trip. The room looked like it had been remodeled and everything worked. You couldn't ask for a better location! The desk staff was average. They didn't go out of their way to be friendly, but weren't rude either. The roof top patio has an excellent view.

<Content>Good Location but that is all I can say I was quite disappointed in this hotel in that it is rated a 4 star, but on our trip through the US, France, Italy and Greece, we stayed at 3 star hotels that I considered better. The front desk staff were indifferent, 3 star hotels had a 24 hour reception, but the Cavour didn't, the room had a stale smell, the airconditioning might as well not have been there, and Florence has enough of a mosquito problem as is, however the hotel did not have a fly screen on the window, so the minute you left the window open a little bit, a million of the things would come into the room and proceed to bite every bit of skin. Only one of the powerpoints in the room worked, so charging batteries for phones and cameras was a bit of an exercise.Its only saving graces was that it was close to everything - the Duomo is a 2 minute walk away and it is still quite close to things like the Ponte Vecchio and Santa Maria Novella Train station. Breakfast was also very adequate and served on the top floor where if they didnt have stain glassed windows, you would have an excellent view of the Cupola and Bell tower of the Duomo. Would probably not stay there again.

<Content>Disappointed My husband  I spent part of our honeymoon here. We had stayed here 2 years ago. Either we had romanticized the place or they really went downhill. First, we arrived to find that we got a room in their newly renovated wing. Everything about the room was modern from the bathroom to the artwork. However, the sink in the bathroom spit brown water when we turned it on and the shower went from hot to cold several times during our (very) quick showers. The artwork had a splattered red look  reminded me of a crime scene. Not the most romantic. The room faced a dingy courtyard that made the room even darker. The bed was also very uncomfortable. Apparently the room we had was their best because they were surprised that we wanted to switch. So we got another room in the old wing facing the side street. The bathroom smelled like urine  the beds were no better. Even the breakfast was better last time we were here. We only stayed 2 out of the 5 nights we had booked. The hotel's only saving grace was the location  the helpful staff.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised! After reading some of the mixed reviews on this site, I didn't know what to expect when we visited Hotel Cavour. I'm happy to say that our stay was wonderful! The hotel's location was perfect. It was close to everything, but not on a busy street or in a busy square, so there was minimal noise. The rooms were clean, and the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. When we checked in, the hotel was full, but we needed a larger room, and the staff was able to juggle things around to meet our request. As a result, I am getting married in Italy later this year, and have decided that me and my guests will be staying at Hotel Cavour.

<Content>Good hotel We stayed at the Cavour from 5/19-5/24 and had very good accomodations. Room 401 faced a quiet courtyard and was extremely spacious fitting 3 people. The room was clean and up-to-date. The only problem was a continuous leak in the tremendous bathroom, reported several times to management. Also, staff was the not the friendliest.

<Content>Wonderful Choice location wise This hotel had such a wonderful location, that made me forget the noise during the evenings from the next door bar, and the rudness of the people at the front desk. Once the airconditioning is running you dont hear the noise, and when you only need five minutes to get to any place, you forget the rudness of the front desk staff. The rooms were clean, the breakfast was ok, and remember this, if is clean and has a great location, the restis not important.Will definitely come back here. They have a small restaurant in front openfrom 8 am to 11 pm, with very good food.

<Content>Couldnt have been better Everything about this hotel is great beginning with the front desk personnel who are friendly and helpful all the way to the pleasant breakfast room and nice breakfast. The room was very pleasant, a corner room on the third floor--would highly recommend it. The room was nicely appointed and quite spacious by three star standards. The bathroom also spacious and up-to-date. The interior design, lighting, all the features of the accomodation, very nice. Very highly recommend this well-located hotel

<Content>First-rate in every respect Traveling with one other couple, we spent seven nights at the Cavour, Feb 19-26, 2005, and found it to be an excellent choice for anyone who wants to be in the heart of the historic district. We both had fifth floor rooms with a nice view of the city. Our bedroom and bathroom were clean and housekeeping did a good job of keeping them so. The bed was very comfortable, the staff friendly and helpful, and breakfasts adequate and appealing. Everything is in easy walking distance: less than one minute from the Bargello, five minutes in one direction to the Duomo, and five minutes the other direction to Piazza della Signoria. We would certainly want to return there on our next visit to Florence.
