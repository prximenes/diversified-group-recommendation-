<Content>Good Value Overall I really liked this hotel. The local area is really lively. Tokyo taxis are expensive of course, but for local public transport you only need to take a ten minute walk to a giant subway station. It's almost an underground city. You can get there completely underground through tunnels, which I really appreciated this Winter!I hope they can get more staff who speak English. They're very polite and friendly but I felt embarrassed when I couldn't get 3 staff to understand over the phone that I needed an electric adaptor. I took the gadget to the lobby and showed them it!The rooms here are small, but aren't they all in Tokyo.

<Content>Seriously, don't stay here! I was booked in here for two nights after staying in the Keio Plaza last week and The Kanko Nagoya for the past few days. It was booked through ASIA rooms who said this was a 4* hotel - but it so is not!!On arrival, the person at the information desk very gruffly sent me upstairs without explaining where to go, or why. On check in ( the wait for the lift was about 5 minutes) nobody offered to help me with my luggage, which is unheard of in a Japanese hotel. Then, whilst ladden up with luggage, the receptionist tried to give me a box which had arrived from my company, i could barely make it to the lift without extra boxes - and she was very unhappy when i asked her to keep it for a while (they do not bring things to your room).  I was told i had been upgarded to a 'much larger' room, but when i got here.....I am unsure if this is a capsule hotel, but if so, it doesn't state it. There is no wardrobe, desk, drawers, there is not even room for a case which is now under the 'dressing table' but it means i will trip over the chair if i decide to move. The window is tiny - the air con is pumping out hot air, the bathroom is exactly the same as a pod in my uni accommodation - infact, that is what this 'hotel' is - a large uni residence. It stinks of smoke, there are all kinds of undesirables walking around, the staff could not be more unhelpful if they tried, the walls are paper thin, the room (and in fact whole floor) looks like it was 'desiged' in the very early 80's and i'm dreading breakfast tomorrow! I can't say i was particularly impressed with the Keio plaza, it was a standard four star hotel, but it's now looking like a beacon of hospitality in contrast and it cost exactly the same! Please, don't stay here, leave it to the numerous school trips that use it, try the Keio or just go to a nicer area. On the plus side, it's very close to other hotels and restaurants and is just a minute walk for the park hyatt.I really hope you have a better experience, but i will never be coming back. And feel sorry for me, i have another prepaid night here in this prison!

<Content>Convenient Locatiion With JR Station having an underground walkway built directly linking to the hotel, for people who are independent travellers wanting to explore Tokyo, this hotel does provide excellent convenience. On my last day in Tokyo which was a rainy day, I could explore around the department stores, did some shopping and had my lunch before going back to the hotel to pick up my luggage for departure to the airport through limousine bus, and without getting a drop of rain.Shinjuku Station provides excellent transportation to all parts of Tokyo, whether on JR or Metro. I had a side trip to Hakone and took the Odakyu line from the station, went to Ueno for the museums on JR and Roppongi on Metro. You do not need to know the language and still can find your way around very easily, not to mention of course is the department stores and restaurants in the area.I booked through Priceline with a good rate of around US123 for a single room including breakfast. And the view of the city from the 25th floor when having breakfast is breathtaking. Though you cannot expect much in terms of room size and amenties, this's a pretty good deal. And they offer internet service in the lobby at 100 yen per 10 mins which is convenient for making on-line check-in.

<Content>They really preforms their 3-star hotel's characteristic - NO SERVICE This is my leisure trip and travelling with my husband.It is far away from subway station and shopping area, we need to walk around 15 minutes everyday. So you did exercise enough on every day eventhough they don't have GYM Room.If you are a foreigner, they had strongly and highlight to put the signage/note to ask you go to another corner for the check-in arrangement. It looks like isolated. As their Front Office Ladies is so cool and shouted to me - ask me move front for check-in. However she can be more polite to escort me to walk front for check-in (Do I too demand or this is basic service?) If they can be more polite then they can make me feel more personal service - I think that is their mangement's original concept. But their staff cannot perform it.Room size is small but most of the hotels are like this in Tokyo so I understand and accept.Location of this hotel, no comment as this is fixture, cannot change, unless they can provide complimentary shuttle bus servcie between hotel to shinjuku subway station. They had check-out machine in lobby, which you can make the check-out procedure and no need to talk with their staff. So don't expect they will say Good Bye or Look forward to welcome back you soon. As I mentioned that in the sujbect - they highlight their hotel is no-service provider's hotel.Anyway, if you can afford to pay USD30 more on everynight, why not choose the hotel (Shinjuku Prince Hotel) which is near by the subway station, shopping area and they just completed the renovation for the guestrooms.

<Content>small but clean and great location The Shinjuku Washington is great for location and service. It's a five minute walk from the South Entrance of Shinjuku station.You can anticipate a very small room, but is clean and almost cozy. Free internet and if you book through Asia Rooms you might get a free breakfast too. There are 6 restaurants to choose from. My advice is to book the new building of the annex - the rooms are sligthly bigger.

<Content>Good budget choice to see bustling Shinjuku but be prepared to walk My family and 1 stayed at Shinjuku Washington from 1 - 8 Aug 2008 and booked 2 rooms between the 5 of us. I had subjected the reception of the hotel to a long drawn email QnA session to clarify all our doubts before making a booking. I have to commend them for always being polite and answering my questions promptly. Sometimes even offering more information to help me plan our trip. Kudos to them and it certainly left a good impression before we even left home. I had booked our rooms via email with them so I was assured of getting rooms in the Annex block as well as a double room and triple room as requested.We took the Airport Limo which was easy enough to find and which alighted us at the main entrance. If you stay at the Annex, pls wheel yourself directly to the Annex block. There's an information counter at the main block which we waited at for a good while before being directed to the Annex. The lobby is on the 4th floor (I think, there are many signs) and check in was a breeze. We bought Airport Limo tickets for our journey back at check in as the reception advised us that they might run out of tickets for the only bus we could take back to the airport. I got a triple room with my brother and bf which was large enough with 3 super single beds. It's probably smaller than most western hotels but large by Japanese standards. My parents' double room was however much smaller with little space between the bed and the walls. Enough for 2 but probably claustrophobic for people more accustomed to rooms large enough to swing a cat around. The toothbrushes, shavers and towels are replenished everyday and shampoo and body wash is provided from push dispensers at the tub. A small thing but we thought that it was super smart and thoughtful of them to always provide 3 toothbrushes of different colours so that we wouldn't get them mixed up. The TV gets local channels as well as CNN so we were either amusing ourselves with Japanese ads (which rock btw) or watching CNN's coverage of the lead up to the Beijing games (which was pretty painful). Check the top shelf of the cupboards and you will find more pillows. Use those as the ones on the bed are soft and flat while those in the cupboard are buckwheat pillows which made for very very good sleeping!There is a Family mart (24 hr convenience store) at the ground floor of the main block where we got our breakfast in the mornings. There are a couple of microwaves just outside the Family mart which came pretty handy. There is another family mart and ampm nearby, on the way towards the Shinjuku station if you walk above ground.Though the hotel was pretty good in terms of facilities, you have to be prepared for a trek to the station. There is an underground walk way which connects the hotel to the station. It's at the basement (again not sure of the exact numbering of the floor) near a Qb (A 1000 yen hair salon) and a 10 min walk will get you to the station. The walkway closes at 11pm though so don't get trapped inside. It's better to use the underground walkway to walk towards the station in the day as you can avoid the sun/ cold and the walkway is sloping downwards towards the station. Coming back at night, it would be better to walk above ground as walking up a gradually uphill snaking tunnel when you are exhausted is no fun. There's also a 100yen bus which goes from the station and stops at 2 bus stops near Shinjuku Washington. There is a busstop at the main entrance of the main building as well as one at the back of the Annex block. You should be able to see the 100 yen sign at the pole of the bus stop and check the timings. The last bus is at 10pm if I recall correctly and it's a short ride to the station. The bus service runs in a loop with the bus stopping at the main building stop right out of Shinjuku station and stopping at the Annex block stop after it has done its rounds before going back to the station.Sry for the long post but I really wanted to give as much info as possible to let everyone decide for themselves. This hotel is not for everyone and if you're concerned about dust behind the heavy tables then Keio Hotel or Hyatt might be a better choice. However it's good enough for a bunch of adults who want a comfortable home base to seek Tokyo from.

<Content>Reasonably Priced in Tokyo I have been surprised by some of the reviews on this hotel. People seem to compare this hotel to international hotels in the US or in Europe and you just can't do that. Hotels and apartments in Tokyo are typically small. The Japanese are great at maximizing usable space and this hotel is no exception.You are paying for the convenience of being in Shinjuku. This is the business and play area of Tokyo You are surrounded by many international hotels in the middle of everything that reflects all of Japan, paying a fraction of the costs of the other hotels. I can't say that I love this hotel. It is centrally located, near shopping, restaurants, the parks and transportation hubs. It is convenient and reasonably prices. It is huge complex with very small guest rooms.On a second note, they have the worlds greatest fishing restaurant. It is hard to explain, but your need to understand that in order to get some fresh fish, you will need to catch it out of the stream that runs around the seating area. Our group had some Lobster sashimi that was so fresh that I believe the lobster was still alive as we ate the sashimi. It was delicious.Check out the hotel if you are looking for a bargain. Definitely eat at the Fishing Restaurant. It has been a highlight of my trips to Tokyo. Enjoy!

<Content>Avoid like the plague This is the worst hotel in Shinjuku. Unless you have no other alternative, this hotel is to be avoided. No matter what the price, it is too much. Paper thin walls, plastic sheets on the beds, rude staff, tiny rooms, no windows.. it is an awful place. EXAMPLE; I left clothes in to be laundered. I wrote on the ticket that there were 8 pairs of socks in the bag and five shirts. When I went to collect my clothes, they informed me that I'd have to pay a penalty because there was actually 10 pairs of socks in the bag. Not only that, when I discovered that I had actually only 3 shirts in the bag, they refused to refund my money. Nasty nasty place.

<Content>"Small""Smelly""Dangerous""Expensive"=="Washington Shinjuku" Here are the list of my comments:1, First of all the bathroom was very Dangerous.because the door step is too high it was about 8 inch and is accident prone especially for old people and children,the door was also dangerous because its kind of weird because you have to push it instead of pulling in when you are inside which can be very dangerous when someone is waiting outside.....2. The front desk staff did not even care to ask first if we wanted a non smoking floor or not i believe that this did not meet international standards worst, we would like to move to a non smoking floor but was already fully book!3. There was no complimentary bus going to the shinjuku station(only takes 5 minutes.).4.There was no cabinet doors only hangers5.The toilet is too small and you cannot move comfortably. the bathtub is like a baby bathtub.6. They only give one key and you have to insert the key to have the main power switch on ,when you are outside the power is off 7.i found one of the bed sheets it has several holes in it.8. The max volume of the TV was too low i can barely hear the sound from the bed.9.It was the first time in my entire experience that you need to fully pay your bills during check in....10. it would be impossible for Yao Ming to stand inside the room he will have back pain!..11.The Center table is too low and is wiggly(Made of 1x1 wood only and a small piece of glass)..12.I cannot tell if it was a chair or a sofa..13.I could not tell whether if it was a refrigerator or a safebox because it was small and empty.14.in order for the internet to work you need to open the Television..15.The trash can was very small.16. It was weird the elevator stops at 3rd floor every time when going up and down for no reason..I Rather stay in a capsule hotel than in this hotel.its like a expensive budget meal it was not worth my money (20,000 YEN) From.Room  23**

<Content>great location and breakfast This is a large hotel with all the services included. It looks posh with over staffing everywhere from driveway attendants to downstairs entry information(1st floor) then Reception, lobby attendant and foreign visitor information that doubles as a porter's desk (but no porters) on Level 3 (LB , short for lobby).My wife and I struggled with 3 bags and a 2 year old child, my wife is 5 months pregnant. I was offered no help with the bags at any time but all staff watched us fumble our way into the lobby then to our room. For a service country I found this a disgrace.We checked in and were given a smoking room that was tiny and smelt like an ashtray (smoking is common in Japan). We swapped to a non smoking room and the room was more modern and within the room was a tiny round table useless (removed) and pants press (removed) and a massage chair with kneading and shiatsu settings that was too big to move. It was also very good . The room was tiny and it had a small non-opening window.The entertainment unit was connected to an intra net where you could get RJ45 net connection and a variety of speeds (was best in the mornings when the businessmen had left). Also connected was videos on demand and TV and a few other quite simple information.The room once emptied of round table and pants press was quite nice and although a small room it was well appointed. The bed was against the wall.We had no problems getting an extra towel and other bits.The normal capsule type bathroom was the largest of the 4 hotels we did stay at in Japan.Breakfast was included and was great, with a wide variety of Western and Japanese food available.We did travel with a child of 2 and the hotel made no attempt to create any extras or help or obvious immediate help without being asked. I was told that I was only allowed one room key. I was given another after I begged for about 10 minutes as my pregnant wife did not want to be woken up at 3 am when I arrived home at night and that she would need power while I was gone.Some staff spoke English and some staff should never have entered the hospitality industry but at the same time some staff were great. I believe if you work in an international hotel as a lobby attendant you should at least be willing to try and listen to guests instead of walk off (obviously) and help someone else.The smoking room we had originally been given was smelly and somewhat oddly wrong , but the second room (non smoking) was great, if not small for 3 people and 3 bags and the desire to stand in the room at the same time. However we extended our stay in this room as the breakfast and the location where very very good. and the room had all modern amenities.the room was sometimes very hot and the air con only had low, medium or high settings only. check in and check out was sometimes met with a line. I might stay here again if average could not be found cheaper some place else locally.

<Content>small rooms but surprisingly good hotel for the price Stayed at this hotel at the beginning and end of a trip round Japan visiting friends. It was the only hotel we stayed at in Japan so cannot compare to other hotels but I found it to be in a great location in the heart of lively Shinjuku, close to the train station and lots of other attractions and amenities.The hotel seemed to be mainly for Japanese and foreign business people and didn't have much of an atmosphere, it felt a little like a shopping mall, but it was good value for money and the rooms were comfortable and clean if a little small. Had a few laughs using the toilet the first couple of times until I saw some more ridiculous ones later in my trip and I gather as in most Japanese hotels, there is no western style bath in the bathroom.Tokyo was just awesome and the Japanese people are amazingly friendly and honest. It helped to learn a few Japanese phrases especially asking for directions and the basis niceties as they are so polite. Even if they cannot explain in English where to go, I found several times that people will make an effort to show you directly.A big regret in Japan, at least at the beginning of my trip was not being a bit more adventurous with the food. Spent the first night in KFC with hundreds of other hungry looking foreigners!

<Content>There are better choices I stayed at the Shinjuku Washington, hoping to save a bit of money on a trip to Tokyo. The hotel lobby was in a chaotic state and the staff were not particularly helpful or courteous. My room was clean, but truly tiny and in need of refurbishment. I had to pay extra to leave my luggage for a couple hours after check-out. I would prefer spending more for a nicer hotel, such as the Century Southern Tower in the same area or the Mercure Ginza.

<Content>Terrible Service I'm a frequent traveller and never encounter such poor service by any of the hotels that i had stayed! I had requested an iron and iron board for my clothes. And for 3 nights there's no response from the hotel personel. From day 1, i was told that the hotel has ONLY 5 irons available and i'm on the 2nd waiting list. On day 2, i'm the first of the list and there's still no news til the end of 3rd day! I'm just disappointed with the hotel of such calibrate and in this country !!!!

<Content>Amazing Shinjuku The Washington Shinjuku was everything we expected from a Tokyo Hotel... comfortable, clean, efficient, well-located. We booked a BB option and the breakfast was a lovely choice of hot and cold western  japanese style food. Lovely coffee machine too!The rooms were compact but not as tiny as other reviewers have stated.... The electric toilet was hilarious to use, and I think just added to the whole Japanese experience.The tour desk arranged our excursions out of the city with ease, and we found the metro around Tokyo easily accesible from the hotel. We don't speak a word of Japanese, but had no trouble communicating with either the hotel staff. A polite smile and nod/bow is all that is needed!The bright lights of Shinjuku are just a short stroll away, and there is a good choice of eating and drinking places nearby, too.Would definitely choose this hotel next time we're in Tokyo.

<Content>Passable tWe the Shinjuku Tokyo to be well situated close to good transport links and in a pleasant area. It was very impersonal and there was no help from staff with luggage or finding our room. The hotel was quiet and the room scrupulously clean though incredibly small. With two suitcases and a bed there was hardly any space to move around. The pillows were interesting and appeared to be stuffed with plastic macaroni!It was impossible for us to change our travellers cheques at reception, they would only deal in U.S.Dollars. Checking out was easy but there was a total lack of seating in and around the foyer.

<Content>good value The hotel location is near underground and is convenient to Shinjuku area. Although the room is small (my room is a twin room), I think it is common in Japan. The hotel facilities are adequate. The room is tidy and clean. The room rate is reasonable and acceptable for a small family, single traveller or a couple. The only drawback is that the window is too small. You cannot expect having a good view.

<Content>Not bad This hotel is tiny compared to other hotels we stayed in Tokyo. The positive side is, their room is neat  tidy, without any bad smell, and what surprised us is the in-room massage chair! But we also unhappy with the service we received at the hotel conceige, the staff did not speak English and was not very patient and polite. If they can improve the employee training, I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Small Rooms My wife and I stayed in the main building in a double room. On the positive side, the room was very clean and recently renovated, so it had a very modern feel. The hotel has a 24-hour convenient store inside which was great for snacks. Also there is a bus that stops right outside the hotel that goes to Shinjuku station, which was very helpful. There is also an underground walkway from the station all the way to the hotel.On the negative side, of the 5 hotels I have stayed at in Tokyo, this one was by far the smallest. The room was practically a double bed with 4 walls surrounding it. The 2 feet in front of the bed was not enough space to lay down any luggage. Also the heat from the shower raised the temperature in the room about 20 degrees, and there is no in-room temperature control. Be careful when you check out as if you are past 10am, they charge you an extra $10 an hour. Lastly, the walk to/from the station is much farther than it looks on the map, and the bus only runs until 9pm.

<Content>Great Location This is a great value hotel in a nice part of town. My wife and made our first visit to Tokyo and stayed here for 6 nights. The double room is small, but not at all unpleasant. Bed was hard yet very comfy. Bathroom was small. Our room had a massage chair, which proved to be a wonderful surprise. There is a 24-hr convini in the lobby as well as intl phones and Internet kiosks. The top floor restaurant is nice. The gov building with the free observation floor is a block or two away, and the train station is a 10 min walk down the main street. Room was around $120 per night. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>very comfortable stay I chose the Washington Hotel because of its convenient location. I found the staff to be very friendly and professional. The rooms are very cozy and clean. The concierge was always happy to provide me with all of the information that I required about hotel services, city attractions, and transportation to and from various places in the city such as Embassies and subway locations. I would definitely stay at the Washington Hotel the next time I am in Tokyo.
