<Content>Great 5* Hotel, but consider the following thoughts before you travel - Travellersalot has been written re the Interconti in Berlin; a very brief summary:Positives- renovated hotel building- ok-sized rooms, with modern bathrooms, not too small- efficient service, be it the Concierge or be it the Room Service- spectacular pool and spa area - gym is a bit cramped and smallish but has running, cycling, crosstrainer plus 3 machines- attractive leasure rates!- HUGO's - a Michelin-Star restaurant, on the top floor.-- There is really nothing to complain.However, a few thoughts for you to consider:-Location: Hotel is in the West, good location for shopping in the West in KaDeWe - but not much more; its a bit of a trip to the Pergamon and other Museums. My observation is that most of the funky and interesting sites are no longer in the area of the hotel, but have moved East. if you plan to be there, by the Government buildings, the location is a negative.Business purpose of Hotel: The next US President will stay here, so its a clearcut business Hotel; a leasure guest will feel a lack of soul - its big sized and has lots of space in the lobby.So i rate it 5* - its very well managed, but might be a bit off for the LindenOper, Pergamon Museum, Friedrichstrasse Shopping, Alex, etc.

<Content>Brilliant time at the Intercontinental Just got back yesterday and we had a great stay at the Intercontinental. The refurbished rooms are tastefully decorated and our family sized room was spacious. Only gripe is the lighting is a bit dark. Nice elemis bathroom products, the swimming pool and jacuzzi very welcome after trudging around in the cold. We found the staff very friendly and helpful. Would definitely go back there. Had a great time in Berlin generally but everything of course seems so much more expensive now with the terrible exchange rate.

<Content>very modern rooms I stayed for several days and was really impressed by the modern design of the rooms, one part of the wall (holding the tv and mini bar) could even be swiveled, something i've never seen before. I was on the 4th floor facing the street but the traffic noise was not too bad, and could not really be heard if the window was shut (it was nice that you could open the windows for real air though). My two problems with the hotel were:1. tv was totally sealed in the cabinet behind some glass, so I could not connect my laptop to it to use the tv as a display. the glass was dusty on the inside too which didn't do much good for the tv quality, not that I watched tv that much.2. concierge gave totally incorrect advice on whether to get a day travel pass or a berlin welcome card (which = travel card + discounts on some museums and attractions). according to him the welcome card was only good if you visited lots and lots of things, but in reality a 3 day welcome card was only 3e more than a 3 day travel card and one trip to the zoo got me 3e discount so the welcome card is worth it even with one visit to somewhere like the zoo.

<Content>Business Beside Ritz Carlton and The Regent the best Hotel for a Business Stay in Berlin. Quick check in and check out (like 1 minute each, people use your name when speaking with you, which you do not see often in Europe), freshly renovated rooms, convenient amenities. What do you want more when travelling for business and only sleeping/staying like 6 hours in a hotel.

<Content>LOVED IT - COULD HAVE STAYED LONGER A very luxurious hotel. Great swimming pool area.Wonderful huge bed. Great choice at breakfast. Although it is probably not in the best location since the wall came down. The bus 200 stops right outside, which takes you to either Zoo or Alexanderplatz.

<Content>Memories of West Berlin The Interconti used to be a legend, staying there was so out of reach for most people that it became associated with movie stars, politicians and the superrich. 1970s design prevails, if you're into retro stuff this is the place to go. Staff was friendly, my room was renovated and quiet. The location is somewhat disadvantageous since the wall came down. The heart of former West Berlin is no longer where the action is and you'll need a taxi to move around. The buffet breakfast in the L.A. Cafe at 27 euros is somewhat overpriced. Choice is limited and I haven't seen roastbeef, shrimps or other expensive ingredients justifying that price in a city where eating out is ridiculously cheap. I got a coffee refill after a while, but no one ever offered me a capuccino. Catering staff simply doesn't care that much, but maybe that's Berlin. So I would stay there again and get breakfast outside.

<Content>An excellent choice My husband and I stayed at the Interconti Berlin for four nights during X-mas 2007. The hotel is huge, very modern, elegant and sparkling clean. It was beautifully decorated and staff attentive.We loved our room, although a bit small. Pampering bed-linen changed every morning. Bath robes and slippers wait for your at the bathroom. The bath tub itself huge and you can choose the exact temperture of water you like. After a frozen day in Berlin, it was something we really appreciated.Breakfast was rich with so many choices, that each morning we practically had a different breakfast.the hotel is ran smoothly, and surprisingly it is very very quiet.One small problem, it is a bit off the center, about 15 minute walk from most attractions and from the nearest subway station.It is a nice walk, but if you plan to stay out late at night, better grab a cab.

<Content>Fantastic! I have just returned home from a weekend in the Intercontinental in Berlin and felt the need to write an immediate review. I absolutely loved this hotel - there was nothing I didn;t like. The Vitality Club is fantastic with really good facilities - we thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon swim and sauna. The food in the LA Cafe was excellent; particularly the chinese food. The room was lovely and the beds extremely comfortable. The hotel is in a great location - close to one of the main thorougfares where we were able to get a sightseeing tour of the city. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to have a special weekend in berlin. I will definitely book this hotel again

<Content>Very Nice Hotel This is a huge hotel near the Zoologcal Garten... The rooms were clean and a good size.... We stayed for 3 nights from 13th July...The hotel was busy....and plenty of people coming and going....the first night we were tired so we tried the Chinese restaurant in the hotel...The food was nice but expensive and lacked any atmosphere with only one other table occupied on a Sunday night....(I cant understand why some of these 5 star hotels dont lower their restaurant prices...when they have so many pottential customers staying on the premises, who normally eat elsewhere,it doesnt make business sense).Anyhow the hotel is nice...and I got it at a good rate...Its in a nice area...and the 200 bus stops outside the hotel...To travel around Berlin...I would recommend getting a welcome card trael ticket at the train station...鈧?5.50 for 48 hours... it covers all trains and buses that you will need.ie in Zones A and B...(But Beware Schonfeld airport is now in Zone C). To see Berlin in a few days...it is difficult on foot unless youare very fit..

<Content>Overall great - modern style room Overall very good. We used the room, lobby and garage for a one night stay as tourists in Berlin. We got a room (295) in the renovated section and liked the style and amenities. They have integrated the bathroom and closet, in a functional way. The room felt spacious and in addition to the queen (?) size bed a desk/chair and one sitting chair. Lots of useable shlf spaces in the room. The tv was small. The room did face Budapester Strasse, still the noise was OK, even when we opened the window.The checkout was ok - except for a discussion over a charge for a pay for movie we did not watch and the hotel waived the charge. We did hang out for 20 min in the lobby and it is large, I'd like it to be a bit more cozy.Regarding the booking: we used hotwire to book and then found out rooms in Swissotel (highter rated in tripadvisor) were available for the same rate.

<Content>Like home away form home... This is my preferred hotel in Berlin. I stay there often and I look forward to it. It is located on a treed, less busy street, a short walk away from great shopping, and the park. In the main (older) the rooms are spacious, with a large work desk and a sitting area. I prefer that old part of the hotel, where the rooms are bigger and better laid our. These are better than the junior suites, which are essentially the same space divided into a small ante room, a small bedroom, without a bidet in the bathroom. This main part of the hotel could use a makeover, as the decor is a bit tired in some rooms. Hopefully this would include modern amenities, such as flat screen TVs, while maintaining a classic and calming decor. The new part of the hotel is recently renovated: the rooms are smaller, but meant to be multi functional. I suggest you look at those rooms to see if you like them. The service is great, as is the housekeeping and food service (great breakfast).This used to be THE happening hotel in Berlin, these days perhaps a bit overshadowed by the Adlon Hotel (very expensive) for Government business but still no small player. Many celebrities appreciate it's location and great service: politicians, sports personalities and foreign heads of state.

<Content>A great hotel Stayed for two nights 17th / 18th May 2008, it's a great hotel with great rooms, the bar area had live music on the two nights we stayed. The food in the restaurant was very good and the staff were really attentive. The hotel also has a great swimming pool and spa area.It's also in a great location for central Berlin on a quite side road, 10 mins walk to the centre of Berlin.Would definately recommend it at the price we obtained for the weekend, not as expensive as you would imagine.

<Content>Place to stay in Berlin - business Enormous hotel for Berlin, great rooms, wonderful breakfast, real swimming pool  spa, good fitness center with TV incorporated in the running belts (don't forget the earphones).Otherwise, when the weather is nice you are along a few very nice running paths with a nice park.Nice location, and don't forget you're very close to the Berlin Philharmonic with two separate concert halls  great concerts ! (Even if fully booked take your chance one hour in advance and try to get a ticket if you can).I stayed in a normal room, it is very very nice when compared to others in Berlin ( elsewhere...). It was clean for sure, but might as well take the dust off those nice wooden shelves...Also friendly  professional staff...

<Content>ITB I stayed at the Intercontinental Berlin in March 2008 for the ITB travel fair. This is a very busy time for all the Berlin hotels and naturally also for Intercontinental. When arriving the blond receptionist informed that my reservations must have been double booked as there were two bookings under my name and that the reservations could not be cancelled. I was told that I probably had double booked when booking through the internet. After finally checking she came back and informed that it was a mistake by the reservations department... When you pay 325 Euros per night, this is not the best welcome...Later on the same day the dark haired receptionist compensated for everything with a gentle smile and very correct and concise information regarding any query. The rooms of the hotel are nice, spacious and with all amenities that you expect from a hotel of this category. I had dinner in the cafe that was very nice with friendly service. I opted for the buffet but also the a la carte was of very nice presentation. Only negative point was that maid service knocked on the door three times before 09h30... I guess they were in a rush... but to their excuse the red light button - do not disturb - was not lit.The hotel is very well placed with walking distance to many interesting points in the city centre.

<Content>Fabulous stay I spent five days during last Christmas in Intercontinental Berlin and I think I don't have so many things to say. A really Excellent hotel!When I can start from. A perfect location very close to the city center, but also a very quiet one.Excellent rooms, so elegant with impressing decoration and facilities. Superb bathroom, with all required facilities for a luxury stay, even a separate small room where you can put your whatever you don't want to have into the the main room.Satellite TV, all kinds of teas and coffees for free into the room. Fantastic beds! Also a small desk full of information brochures about the hotel and Berlin!Very rich breakfast with everything you can imagine!Huge lobby with many different places where you can stay, enjoyning your coffee or your drink. Consider Intercontinental Berlin as a 5-star hotel and go there when you have the possibility.

<Content>Nice hotel, but a bit expensive for food and drink This is a very nice full-service hotel. We stayed for 5 nights over New Years. Hotel is in a convenient location that's just far enough from the bustle. Hotel garage has a really small garage and is 20 euros per day. They ran out of space for cars on New Years Eve/Day. Internet is 20 euros per day in the room, but there is free wifi in the lobby, a real treat in Germany!Nice bar, but it has a limited selection for food items, and is fairly expensive-a 3/4 liter bottle of water is 12 euros-and not at all helped by the lousy exchange rate with the dollar. Buffet breakfast was very good and had a large variety items, but was about 25 euros per person. We had dinner once in the LA Cafe, which specializes in Chinese food, was really-well prepared, probably some of the best Chinese food I've had anywhere. Lobby areas became non-smoking on January 1.We had requested a renovated room because of the reviews that had been posted about older rooms. Room was a nice, renovated, contemporary with a queen/king bed. Bathroom was nice but because of it's design and door, didn't contain noise very well, it would be hard not to wake up someone who was trying to sleep if you were taking a shower. Also the shower has the typical 1/2 glass shower panel which tended to leak/splash water all over the floor. There is also a window above the tub opening to the room which has a closed mini-blind in it, which allows for some visibility into the shower  bathroom, which may not be pleasant if sharing the room with a co-worker.There is a nice pool/hot tub area. Access to the spa area is 15 euros. The spa area is really nice and has a cold room with cold plunge pool/ice batch and has an open roof to the outside. Nice sauna/steam areas and 2 relaxation areas, 1 with personal heated water beds and 1 with heated recliner-like lounge chairs. We spent New Years Day there since most things were closed.We had booked the room through our travel agent and had a non-refundable rate which was a bit cheaper. The Priority Club loyalty program would not credit our $1900 stay, calling it a non-qualifying rate which I found to be a hugely aggravating. I would choose to stay somewhere else because of this fact alone.Overall this is a nice hotel, but it is a bit expensive and I felt a bit nickel and dime'd at times.

<Content>Excellent Club Service. I have recently returned from a three night extended weekend stay at the Intercontinental Hotel in Berlin. The hotel is very easy to find and is around a 10 minute walk from the Zoologischer Garten station. The taxi fare is around five euros.At check-in I was assigned a Club room which was a great touch as I am a platinum elite and Intercontinental Ambassador member of priority club.The hotel has two Club floors which are located in the newer East wing of the hotel. My deluxe club room was excellent and had two twin beds, two televisions and the bathroom was just beautiful with large tub and separate rain shower and of course, Molton Brown amenities. I also had a lovely letter from Guest Relations welcoming me back to the hotel. Turndown service was provided each evening.As my room was on the Club floor I also had exclusive access to the IC club lounge. The lounge offers complimentary internet access with one public computer for the sole use of club guests which was heavily used. Refreshments and snacks are available throughout the day. In the evening a self service cocktail bar is available with unlimited champagne, spirits, wine and beer together with a selection of evening canap茅s. The IC lounge has separate seating areas, dining area, magazines and newspapers. The lounge closes at 22:30.Breakfast was also provided in the lounge for Club guests. The breakfast was excellent including cold and warm choice.I also used the vitality club which is available to club guests. The gym is rather small with limited equipment and some free weights. The pool area is lovely and the wellness area with sauna,steam and relaxation areas is truly superb.Overall I had a great stay at the Intercontinental Berlin and loved the Club level service.

<Content>Interconti maintains the stars shining It's been 2 years since my last stay at the Interconti Berlin. Returning with high expectations from my previous stays I was more than satisfied. It even seems they have strenghtened their standard of guest services even further and have added some small amenities. (E.g. I don't remember tea and coffee makers in rooms 2 years ago, also the dusty patches hanging from the ceiling 2 years ago were not the case this time). Housekeeping does their job really thoroughly. Everything else in the hotel is consistent with its 5-star classification. The 2 things which especially stick out are the pool/wellness area (which is great) and the excellent breakfast buffet. If there is an item they don't offer for breakfast just ask the cheff and he'll get it for you :). They only small complaint about my this year's stay is the room temperature. I just couldn't get it warm enough, although I had the sensor set to the highest possible value.I am looking forward to coming again to Berlin Interconti.

<Content>Highly Disappointed The Intercontinental in Berlin was highly disappointing to my fiance and I. I was excited when we first checked in because the lobby is very grand and fairly well appointed. The staff seemed nice enough and helpful. The true disappointed came when we checked into the room.The rooms are very TIRED. The carpet from the 1970's has blue bows on it and looks like something from your grandmother's house. The TV was very small and not at all modern, and all of it felt very outdated. The worst part though was the temperature. The room was VERY warm all night long (and this was in a cold night in November). We got up in the middle of the night to crank up the AC and open the window, but the temperature didn't change. Only when we called the front desk in the morning did they instruct us to remove the wood paneling below the sink in the bathroom (which revealed all of the pipes, etc.) and manually turn down the radiator (which was on 5 - the highest level!). I would not recommend staying here, it is not a good value at all, not is it a good experience.

<Content>Fantastic I stayed in this hotel in September 2006 with my partner. It was absolutely beautiful. I could not fault the hotel in any way. The room was very big with a super -kingsize bed. T.v, tea  coffee, facilities etc. The bathroom was big and cleaned to high standard. The bath and shower were brilliant. The breakfast was buffet and there wasa great selection.The hotle bar was lovely with very warm and friendly staff. The cocktails were made to perfection!The hotel was very close to the zoo and the train station.

<Content>Dirty bathroom, bad service The room - on the executive floor - could have used a good dusting. The bathroom was only partly cleaned, especially the toilet wasn't. Even after telling housekeeping about the problems, one would figure, they would give the room a very good cleaning the next day - well, that didn't happen. Just the bath tub and the sinks got cleaned, the mirror, glass partition, tiles were very obviously not. We had reserved a non-smoking room and upon check-in the receptionist confirmed the room as non-smoking. Entering the room we had to discover - it was a smoking room.People in our party asked for another room, because of the proximity to the elevator and twin beds (mentioned in the reservation) and were told very rudely that's the room we've given to you, so you have to take itThis is no 5-star hotel. But with their location and being one of the hotels in Berlin offering a great number of rooms, they think they simply don't have to work that hard.Very disappointing experience there!

<Content>Always Stay Here I have stayed here on at least 5 occasions. I love this hotel. I stayed in the new rooms the first time which I liked, but from the second visit onwards we have stayed in the older wing. The rooms are usually suites. They are huge. They have always been quiet. I think I may have commented on this hotel before, but the guy who had the problem with the concierge has prompted me to add my tuppenceworth.We asked for two pieces of information. Firstly how to get to the Gardens of The World which is in the deepest east. The concierge told us exactly where to get off the S bahn, what bus number to get on, and what stop to get off. He had to look up the 'puter, but none the less we were delighted. The gardens are a gem, especially the Islamic one.We noticed posters up for horse races around the place. We asked if the track was flat racing, jumpers or Carts. He knew it was carts, which isn't our cup of tea. We have no complaints. The guy will get asked dumb questions like these two from the tourists. He does OK.

<Content>We were slightly dissapointed The hotel was modern, the staff friendly, the breakfast-buffet great and the location very central with a city-bus covering all the major attractions in Berlin right outside the door. But as mentioned we were slightly disappointed. The largest problem was that the modern room design, with doors chosen for their looks, and not for their sound-insulating capabilities. The result is that privacy on the loo is only possible by turning up the television-volume. The maid not respecting the do-not-disturb light and the complementary shampoo smelling like cleaning detergents were also letdowns. Considering the price of the rooms we can therefore only rate the hotel as average.

<Content>Ultramodern rooms I stayed here in May 07 for a business conference, and thought it was a great hotel. There is a new, redesigned wing, and an older, classic wing. I stayed in the new wing in an avante-garde designed room with a great view of Berlin's central park. Very nice room, bathroom, and facilities. Seems like it caters mostly to business travellers and conferences as opposed to families. The sauna was incredible (hot sauna, ice bath, turkish hammam, rainforest shower, etc), but beware that the Germans feel comfortable hanging out naked. Not sure this would be my hotel pick for a vacation - I like more friendly and intimate, but it was perfect for business, and very high-class. Berlin is amazing, make sure to catch one of the boat rides if the weather is nice.

<Content>Excellent Stuff Just got back from a 3 day break at this hotel. Well located for the Tiergarten and only a 10-15 walk from the S or U Bahn. Breakfast was of a high standard, and champagne as well, which was a pleasant surprise. Had an extremely strong cocktail at Marlene's Bar, a Captain Cocktail that had a flaming passion fruit. Floating on top, very theatrical.Did not try Hugo's or any food in Marlene's but i can HIGHLY recommend the Greek restauranty directly across the road. Amazing prices and the best greek food i have ever had, opened till 1am and you can reasonably priced wine during their happy and even a crazy hour. We paid 38 euros for 2 starters 2 mains, 1 litre of wine and 3 cocktails each. BARGAIN!! It was called Rominissis or something, but its the only restaurant around so you really can't miss it.Overall a good stay but Berlin wasn't nearly German enough for me, i think i would have preferred Munich to be honest.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel I stayed in this hotel in December with a large group of Girlfriends. The hotel was beautiful and the staff were really friendly and helpful. The rooms were of a really high standard and beds V comfortable!, there is also a really nice bar and a great gym with pool. Breakfast is also great with a wide selection - put on a few pounds that weekend! - all in all can't recommend this hotel highly enough and hope to return soon.

<Author>London Frequent Traveller
<Content>Top-end business hotel I stayed here in March 2007 while attending a conference. It is located in the old West Berlin, about 5 minutes' brisk walk from the Zoo station. Many rooms have a good view over an old canal towards the Tiergarten. Generally this is an extremely good, well-run international business hotel. The rooms are well-sized and extremely comfortable and convenient. The buffet breakfast, served in a large and often very busy multi-room complex rather remotely sited at the west end of the hotel, offers a very varied choice. The business centre offers high-speed internet access at reasonable rates. If you're on business in Berlin and can afford the rates, this is probably as good as you can find.

<Content>as always... ... positve.usually i prefer boutique hotels, but this is a phantsatsic hotel. great room, very friendly staff, excellent concierge tipps, attent bar peopleincredibly good breakfast. whilst i get upgrades at intercontinentals because of my ambassador club even the standard rooms are big. we were there for new years, and for a fair in feb, and i look forward to our next stay.in the past i disliked the fact that sauna is outsourced, but the beauty is that the 15 鈧?keep many people out, so it is luxouriously empty.

<Content>Space, calm and a wonderful pool/spa Slightly out of the centre but very close to the zoo, aquarium and Wilhelmskirche, this is a top-end luxury/ business hotel. It is above all spacious, clean and calm. Rooms are big and well-kept. The public areas are palacial, the restaurants very well presented and the spa/ pool area is big and luxurious.It is a proper swimming area and the adjoining spa has waterbeds, hot marble beds, plunge pool, sauna and Turkish. Germans go for naked saunas left to themselves (not hotel policy as such!) so be aware of this. The hotel caters for giant functions but they are swallowed into the common parts without a ripple. We stayed a week, with a child, and found the place very friendly and well organised. The concierge is the only let down, being unimaginative: you are better off relying on guidebooks. Taxis are pretty cheap and drivers know where things are. Due to size it is somehow less formal than the Four Seasons but without the loss of any real amenity or style. I actually preferred it. Rates on the internet packages are accessible and you get what you pay for.Girls, take a fancy frock and heels for the evenings.There is one of the best-chosen hotel wine lists I have seen in a long time and much of it is available by the glass to try.

<Content>One word: Outstanding! We stayed in this hotel for our first ever visit to Berlin. We stayed in Deluxe King room, the price of which was extremely reasonable - around 138 euros per night, compared to its standard 350 euros per night.Everything in this hotel impresses - the modern decor, airy and spacy rooms, spa like not many (includes marble heated beds, water beds, numerous variations on showers and even a snow dispenser!), excellent bar, thai/chinese restraunt on the ground floor, internetional award-winning restraunt on the top floor (although if you're on a diet - be careful there ;-) ), and location.Spa is nothing but amazing. Swimming pool, jacuzzi and fitness centre are free, but numerous saunas cost extra 15 euros per evening per person. The service is the one you would expect from one of the top 5 star hotels - with a huge selection of tea and snacks in the swimming pool area.Massages are definitely recommended.Location-wise, it is a short (5-7 minutes) walk from the main shopping area in Berlin - Ku-Damm. A magnificent old cathedral which caught a bomb during WW2 and was preserved the way it was then is near the hotel as well.Overall, the approach Intercontinental takes to pricing is also very appealing: you get an exellent room for a reasonable price, but you don't pay for any extras you don't use - i.e., breakfast, spa, car park, etc.Next time we're in Berlin, we know where we'll stay!

<Content>Modern Luxury We stayed in the Interconti in at the beginning of February 2007 and really enjoyed our stay. I would echo other travellers views that you should ask for a room in the renovated part of the hotel as the rooms really are superior. Our room was big with a 6' bed, under floor heating, a walk in closet, walk in shower and a TV cabinet that allowed you to watch TV in the bath :-) We also had a choice of 7 different types of pillows and the addition of extra blankets, slippers and fluffy dressing gowns were a nice touch. The bed was comfortable and the blackout curtains were excellent. The windows also seemed to be double glazed which meant that the room was very quiet at night. Food in the hotel is very expensive but the breakfast is excellent, there is a very good choice. The bar in the lobby is expensive and the service is slow, so I wouldn't bother with it much.You do have yo pay for use of the sauna but it's worth it as it keeps it relatively empty. There is a womens only sauna as well as a mixed sauna which is a nice touch.All in all I would definitely stay in this hotel gain although it is expensive.

<Author>EdenVillasTilos
<Content>Couldn't fault anything. Wow, what a hotel! The breakfast is amazing and served until 11.30 am (22 euros extra pp if room only). Rooms spacious and a very comfy bed but the highlight for us were the leisure facilities. Large swimming-pool and lots of loungers to sit on. The best thing though is the sauna area, (15 euros extra per day but worth it) there are heated beds or water beds to lie on, a steam room and a herbal steam room, a tropical shower room with different types of showers, a cold room with plunge pool, cold shower and crushed ice coming out of the wall to cool you down after the extremely hot sauna. Be warned though, the German culture is to go naked in this area so if you are shy it may come as a bit of a shock. We found it very liberating and relaxing and would recommend trying it. We did, twice a day during our three day stay!

<Content>Great Value Stayed here for 2 nights Dec. 16 - 18 whilst visiting Berlin for the Christmas markets. There is nothing much that I can really add that other reviews have not said. Central location close to public transport links and Ku'damm shopping area, yet seemed quiet for such a large hotel. All staff that we came into contact with, from front desk to maid service, were helpful and welcoming. Breakfast offered a good selection both hot and cold with an enlarged overflow area for the busy weekend. The room was a nice size albeit not the largest we have ever stayed in but the extra touches (eg. fluffy robe, slippers) were welcome. The best bit has to be the value for money - we paid Euro118 per night for the two of us including breakfast, which we rate as very good.

<Content>Very good Overall, an excellent hotel. Near enough to centre of Berlin (200m from the Zoo) and transport to all areas so location is ideal. Booked online through hotel website at a rate of EUR49 p.p.p.n. - I consider that very cheap for a 5 star hotel but I am Irish so I would! When we arrived at 11am on the first morning (check-in is 3pm), we were offered rooms if we wanted them but told they were near a service elevator or we could wait for rooms and they would ring us when they were ready (they were ready by 1pm). We were given advice on all the things to see in Berlin and restaurants to book. All in all, we got a great impression of the staff. The rooms are of a good standard and the beds are extra-comfortable. The decor of the hotel in general is modern but classy.Pool and spa are great - the EUR15 charge for Sauna area keeps it quieter and more exclusive than it would be if it was free, though the pool was a degree or two below what I would have really liked! The bar is good but we didn't try the restaurant. Prices in the bar are definitely 5 star level for shorts, if I had to complain about something!

<Content>The best hotel As this is the hotel I always stay in. This review is to reconfirm its status as a very good hotel.I have to admit I always stay on the Club floor but it is certainly worth it to pay an extra 50 Euro's or so for the wonderful rooms, the quiet and attentive atmosphere and the wonderful presentation of all the food and drink. The Gluhwein and the absolutely scrumptious Christmas cookies at this time were a wonderful touch.The ever delighful concierge staff downstairs were as helpful as ever. Securing me table one tickets for the Ceasar Twins show.The only critisism one can find is the location of the hotel because it seemed we were never on the West side of the city. It all seems to happen in the East side. I had a peek in the Hilton on the Gendarmen Market which is a great location but oh dear the Executive level rooms were broomclosets with a terrible corporate feel to them. The Executive lounge was totally no competition to IC's Club Floor.

<Content>Very Good I spent two nights in this hotel. The room was spacious and exceptionally comfortable. All of the staff that I dealt with were helpful. The room was one of the newer ones in the east wing, which, as other reviewers have noted, have some interesting revolving furniture and a rather curious arrangement whereby the wardrobe area is in the bathroom. It all seemed to work well though. Good sized pool with sensible opening hours with a dedicated lift. Good car parking arrangements and an excellent breakfast (worth 鈧?2 if you are going to eat the works, but obviously too expensive if you only want a coffee and croissant). Quiet location, but only a short walk to the centre of West Berlin and the Zoo station.A most enjoyable stay.

<Content>Perfect Business Hotel I took a suite. The rooms were small, but clean and the bathroom was great. The breakfast for 15 eros for two per day was amazing. The #200 bus picked us up across the street and goes to the Brandenburg Tor and all through the center of the city. The Ku'dam shopping street is about a 200 meter walk. By looking at the clientel this hotel is mainly for for business travellers. It's the cheapest Intercontinental in Europe if not the world.

<Content>Good hotel in decent location Got a great rate on this room (booked on Hotwire and then found it cheaper online and Hotwired gave me a double the difference credit). Front desk was very nice - allowed me to check in early and even upgraded me to a suite. Room was on the small side but very nice. Location is great for West Berlin, but found it a hike for other sights but not complaining. Didnt take advantage of the spa and pool but heard it was very nice. GREAT PRICE!!

<Content>Keeping it Old School at the Modern Intercontinental At $114 for each of three summer weeknights, I was really satisfied with the Intercontinental. I booked about a month in advance on their website. As stated in other reviews, the location is on the (slightly tourist) bus line 200 and a 5 minute walk to Ku'damm, and 10 minutes to the Zoo Garten Train station. Note, it was a 15-20 minute walk to a cheap internet cafe (open till eleven-thirty) attached to a dunkin donuts on Ku'damm. This was a decent vantage point and was obviously a safe and quiet neighborhood. Fast food restaurants are opposite the Gedaechtnis Kirche if you are absolutely desperare for cheap fare late at night. The rooms themselves are very modern, but almost frustratingly so. The bathroom door has a hole for a handle, and the toilet door is opaque. So, no real sense of firm privacy is established. The shower also had no curtain, but rather a limited glass door. So it was kind of easy to accidentally spill some water on the floor (not to mention slip and break your neck). Still the design was cool and memorable. The breakast buffet was too expensive for our liking, however, our guide book had a listing of six special places for breakfast in Berlin. What also bothered me was the fact there was a 3 euro surcharge for dialing a 800 number (so to use a phone card, you had to go to the Telefonzelle across the street. The pool was mid-seized but adequate and clean. The whirlpool was out of this world. On weeknights we had the facilitiies practically all to ourselves. Plus they are open to 11, perfect after a long day and big dinner. The staff was friendly and completely bilingual. Be sure to pick up an umbrella (for free) at the concierge if you anticipate rain while sightseeing. Alltogether I enjoyed my stay and would book again at anything below $120 a night.

<Content>Very good! I stayed with two members of my family at this hotel. We had a junior suite and it was great. It had two bedrooms - one with two single beds in it, your average hotel room, and one with a large double bed and a living room area. We also had two bathrooms. The room was very comfortable and it was nice to come back to it after a long day of sight-seeing.I only had one breakfast at the hotel because of various reasons, but it was very good. Close to the main concierge were a collection of jewellery shops if jewellery shopping is your thing.I loved how the Intercontinental Berlin was so modern in every aspect. It was also decorated beautifully, but more modern than traditional. I think anyone going here for business or tourism or any other reason would have an enjoyable stay. There is a taxi rank just outside the hotel if you want to be driven somewhere.Great!!!

<Content>Excellent Berlin Hotel I have stayed here for business and pleasure and both experiences have been great. Only downside is that it takes several minutes walk to the Ku'dam or subway but there are always cabs available at the door. Staff courteous, rooms are very comfortable and the breakfast is excellent. I have stayed at other 4 and 5* hotels in Berlin but this is my favourite as well as being very good value. Book early and you can get some very good deals.

<Content>Loved It! I'm surprised that this hotel only rates as a 4 Star. This was my third stay here and I absolutely enjoy this hotel. It is in a great area (if you like shopping); and there's even a zoo right down the street. The hotel staff is very courteous; and for all you bathroom fanactics (like me) --- the hotel has beautiful marble bathrooms. The breakfast is a little pricey; but it presents a nice buffet. The restaurant at dinner time is pretty good as well. Each time I've stayed at this hotel; I've gotten a good rate. To me, this is the best deal for the money. If you like the modern feel of hotels; then this will satisfy your taste.

<Content>First class hotel My family and I stayed at this hotel last August. As members of the Interconinental Hotel Group loyality program our rooms were upgraded to suites. My wife and I had a classical room whilst my children (19  23) had a modern room with some revolving furniture, including the unit the television was on which they thought was pretty cool. The staff was very good. We took advantage of the hotel's own airport limousine service which again was excellent. Normally I am against eating in hoteIs but we chose to eat on a Saturday night as they offered an excellent barbcue which was very reasonable. The hotel is reported to have one of the best restaurants in Berlin. We didn't visit this rooftop restaurant, however it is clearly used by the locals - you may have to prebook a table - I think it was full when we visited. The hotel is close to the zoo and has metro links within walking distance that take you to the main tourist areas of the City.

<Content>Very good second trip Just back from a second stay at the Interconti, and again we had a very good time. This time we upgraded to the club floor, and made very good use of the club lounge and its facilities. Everything was spotless and of excellent quality, and we got our money's worth in breakfasts, afternoon coffees, early evening beers and generally lolloping around in the lounge so as not to feel cooped up in the room (we did leave the hotel as well to go sightseeing, honest!). My only complaint would be that the club lounge did close a little early, and when we tried to go up for an after dinner drink at 10.30 they were closing up for the evening. The room was spotless and the bed really very comfortable. While the rotating TV cabinet was amusing, it didn't really add greatly to our experience, and it was somewhat surprising when flicking through the TV channels to get a brief interlude of hard-core porn flash up on the telly for a moment. I think if you children with you, you can get those channels barred completely. The bathroom was very attractive, though the double ended bath was difficult to sit up in without getting your hair wet. Again, just little niggles.The hotel is on a quiet street, 5 minutes from the Ku'damm and Zoo Station. We liked being tucked away, and were not really disturbed at all it, but it may not be where you want to be if you like it at the centre of the action. We were reassured when we passed on a tour to be told that the hotel is the most secure in Berlin! Good.We can't wait to go back to Berlin, which is a fantastic city, and if we can get as good a deal again to the Interconti, can't see too many reasons for staying elsewhere.

<Content>Quite nice ! I have stayed in this hotel over the week-end with my girlfriend and our dog. It is not in a extremely central location, even if you still can walk to the centre ( or, better, take a cab, there are plenty of them available in front of hotel, a ride to the centre will cost you 10-15 euros ). The hotel itself is nice, modern-styled place. We have stayed in a Junior Suite, which have a very classical design - not necessary bad thing, but, compared to the ultra-modern standard rooms looks a bit outdated and disappointing. The room itself is quite big, with a separate sitting area fitted with a second TV. The bathroom was big, with a separate shover and the tub.However, the service was fine, them even give to our dog a dog-kit ( food plate, water plate, small carpet and a snack ), this was very nice and make you feel welcomed. The breakfast was fine, even if the restaurant is a bit overcrowded. The only disappointing thing was that you need to bring your bathrobe from your room to the pool , them refuse to give you a new one there, even if them have plenty of them available on the shelves ! This is quite a strange thing for a 5* hotel..... Overally, I would recommend this hotel, if you can find a good rate, it's a nice place to spend you week-end in Berlin !

<Content>Fantastic Hotel With Great Service This hotel has to be one of the best hotels in terms of service I have ever stayed in.We arrived during a major conference yet the hotel accomodated our early check in request. When calling room service guests are addressed by name. Service is exceptionally efficient and polite.We took a junior suite, whilst not the largest room of this type I have stayed in, it was exceptionally well appointed. The bathroom had a bath and separate cubicles for the wc and shower.The concierge staff were an amazing bank of knowledge, which is sadly all too unusual these days. They even purchased a mobile phone for me in advance as I had left mine at home and called them with only 1 hours notice.

<Content>Superb hotel We stayed for just 1 nght on the club level floor and couldn't fault the hotel (apart from the lack of coffee making facilities in the room.) Access to the club lounge was included and we enjoyed the excellent choice of snacks and drinks available all for the price of our room. It's location was very convenient for the zoo station not to mention the superb shopping at the Ka de We. We would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Shame about the awful smell in the bathroom! Stayed here on business and fortunately didn't pay for this myself. Was upgraded to a larger room with 2 seater settee and table. Extremley comfortable beds although the pillow was so soft it was hardly worth using. I'm sure though if I'd asked for more I would have got them. This is a very large impersonal hotel. Great for business but I'm glad I didn't take my family. The breakfast was really good, lots of selection and plenty of places to sit. All spotlessly clean, food was very fresh and tasty.The only aspect that let this hotel was the appalling smell in my shower when I returned in the evening. The smell of sewerage coming up through the drain was appalling and I was on the 7th floor. I have to say that this alone would prevent me from staying here again which is such a shame because the room was so comfortable.The mini bar was extremely poor and there was no turn down service but it didn't matter greatly as I spent so little time in the hotel.If they could sort the drainage problems out, I'd stay here again on business. But it's too impersonal to want to stay here on vacation.

<Content>A pleasant stay Just returned from a 2 night stay - Was upgraded to a Senior Suite on the 5th floor of the new wing. In reality, the suite is two interconnecting rooms with the connecting door unlocked and the room was very dark. However, we enjoyed our stay, the room was comfortable and the service was average for a 5 star hotel.Would return though.

<Content>Excellent Berlin Hotel I just returned from Berlin where I spent 3 nights at the Berlin Intercontinental Hotel. I stayed in one of the club rooms that was located in the renovated part of the hotel.The room was very contemporary and comfortable, although a bit small. The hotel staff was extremely courteous and helpful, and the hotel was very clean.The hotel has a great 'Wellness Area' that is located on the first floor but charges regular hotel guests 15 euros a day to use it (club floor guests do not pay the additional charge).The hotel's gym is not up to par though....just a couple of treadmills, a few weights, and a couple of machines. Given the size and attention spent on the 'Wellness Area' I was surprised that the gym was so weak.Hotel is well located near Tiergarten and the Zoological Garden of Berlin. Club lounge on the top floor is very nice too, with free WIFI access to guests.

<Content>Swank hotel I stayed at the Intercontinental Berlin in July 2005.This is one of the most swank hotels that I have stayed in all of Europe. The decor in the room was VERY contemporary with a TV/bar that would swivel. Thus you could watch TV either from your bed or from the jacuzzi tub! The bedding was great, similar to the dream beds that are found in the Westin Chains. Finally the rooms are remarkably quiet. I felt like I was sleeping in my own house.The location is top notch. It is a five minute walk to the Tiergarten along a rather quiet street. The ZOO train station is a 10 minute walk in the opposite direction. I found this hotel in the last minute and would definetely stay again.

<Content>Perfect weekend We spent two nights at the Interconti. At check-in a manager welcomed us and guided us to club-level. Discreet atmosphere and modern design (retro). The other wing has a more traditionell make-up. The room was spacious, the bed perfect. The bathroom very pleasing with a cosy tub and an extra rainshower. Shoeshine was for free. The staff friendly and always at hand. Nice breakfast and a pre-dinner reception in the evening. Snacks and softdrinks all day long. I will be back soon.The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Zoo-station and a close to the KaDeWe.

<Content>A genuine 5-star experience! Second time we make a 1 night stop at the InterContinental Berlin (August 2004  2005). The first time, we couldn鈥檛 fault this top-class hotel. Breath-taking reception (you feel like you鈥檙e checking-in at the airport), polite and professional staff, great room (with separate rain shower) in the newly renovated wing, excellent location and, last but certainly not least, the amazing breakfast: the choice's so wide that everyone will find something to his tastes. This year, the only 鈥渄isappointment鈥?refers to the bathroom. The rain shower and the bath were integrated and鈥?it鈥檚 not so pleasant to have a bath while small drops are falling on your head from the rain shower above!Anyway, InterContinental Berlin deserves its 5 stars for sure!

<Content>Excellent We stayed at the IC Berlin for 6 nights in July 2005. Very warm and friendly welcome at the reception. All our requests (no smoking, two beds) were noted and we had no problems in getting the room we were looking forward to. The room was very nicely designed. Especially the turnable TV/Minibar was a fantastic idea we've never seen before. In the evening we hit the bar. Really great choice of (very good) drinks and very friendly service. The breakfast the following morning was one of the best we've ever seen. The choice cannot be described. Really great.We booked a luxury escape rate at Eur 147 - a real bargain for that kind of hotel and service. The location of the hotel is quite ideal. It seems that life in Berlin has moved to the eastern part of the city. But there's a very convenient Bus Service (Bus # 200) that stops just in fron of the hotel and that brings you to all the important points in the east just in a few minuntes.Overall a very good experience. Would recommend this place if you are looking for good service, value for money, good location and a very nice and cozy place.

<Content>Very Pleased Spent 4 nights at this hotel in May and was very pleased with our time there. We had a club floor room which was well appointed, spacious and well maintained. The added amenities of the club lounge were wonderful offering a great breakfast and goodies throughout the day and into the evening. It's large and spacious as well and does offer a non smoking area which was important to me. The hotel restaurants were good as well where we enjoyed a number of meals. Also found the hotel to be in a central location and within walking distance to many local attractions.Would definitely stay at this establishment again.

<Content>Weekend favorite Berlin is one of my favorite cities and this hotel is the tops. Spent a three day weekend in May with my daughter and her friend. Intercontinetal offered a special of 50% off on the second room, so I had peace and quiet, and the girls had their own space. We were on the club floor, perfect for pre-teens/teens, as there is always some kind of food and beverage provided. We even ate dinner in the club lounge our first night: soup, salad and assorted heavy appetizers. With possibility of breakfast, lunch and dinner, the club floors offer a good value!One of our destinations was the Berlin Zoo in the Tiergarten, so this was an easy walk from the hotel. We also walked through the Tiergarten the other direction all the way to Brandenburger Tor (only for the hearty!)Staff in the club lounge were very friendly and helpful. The bathrooms are already described well by others (the girls were able to quickly figure it all out!). The moveable wall separating the bath and the bedroom with the built-in TV was quite clever.The girls enjoyed the pool in the spa area (the second day they were made unwelcome by the staff, but they handled it having had a successful swim the day before).Note: This might be a farther walk than desired by some for KuDamm or public transportation. Taxis were plentiful and mostly friendly.

<Content>Convention city Great location but this is a convention hotel. Large and anonymous and you are surrounded by people wearing badges!Room was tiny, nice view of the zoo though. Shower was broken and this must be the only hotel in the world where you can not watch the TV from the bed. e20 for internet is outrageous and how can a hotel like this not offer WiFi.Stayed there the night of Champions League soccer and not a siingle TV in the place could get the Premiere channel that shows the Champions League in GermanyWent for a walk on my final morning, got back to the room an hour or so before check out to find my room already being made for the next guest, despite my bags etc still all over the place. Not a hint of an apology.Dinner in LA Cafe was poor with a choice of chinese or ... chinese, no atmosphere and surly staff.The only redeeming feature was dinner at Hugo's and fortunately I wasn't paying. The view over Berlin is a stunner and the food and service were excellent.If you are in Berlin for a convention then the hotel is OK, if you have a choice then try somewhere else.

<Content>Verry nice stay with super breakfast. We stayed at the Intercontinental from September 1 until 3. We were given a room on the thirth floor of the renovated east wing, but that room had no view so I asked another room. We were given one on the fifth floor. We found it a verry nice stay and the breakfast was super. The pool was verry nice in contrast to the two ladies behind the desk.Conclusion :I would go back

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Intercontinental for 3 nights from 9-12 October. Secured an excellent rate for a room on the Club Floor. The hotel was modern and sparkling. Stunning atrium entrance. The room was clean, although no tea/coffee making facilities. We had breakfast at the LA Cafe - wide choice and efficient staff. Still don't know why they allow smoking in public areas or in restaurants. I suppose they'd lose 40% of their clientele. The spa area was very nice as well. Also we made full use of the club lounge - open bar from 6pm -snacks during the day. Nothing like popping in for an aperitif or several nightcaps. Highly recommended.

<Content>Try and stay elsewhere What a disappointment this hotel is .At check in they had the wrong details ,the room we were first allocated was smokey and had cigarette ash on the floor despite being a non smoking room.Changed to another room which wasn't smokey but still very disappointing in terms of decor and comfort.I ordered an ice bucket ,four hours later it arrived.I reported faults with lights in the bathroom ,a faulty telephone and a fault with the air con.They only managed to fix the lights even though I reported all faults three times.Had dinner in the restaurant .Good food ,very slow service and warm beer.Breakfasts were very good .The Spa and pool were very good and they're open till 11.00pm.This is supposed to be a 4/5 star hotel ,but put it at the bottom of your list.Try and stay elsewhere.

<Content>Good Hotel The location of the Hotel InterContinental is undeniably excellent but the downside of being near the zoo is that especially during the summer you cannot open the windows as insects esp. mosquittos will get in your room. Not mentioning the occasional smell of elephant dung.We were lucky enough to have secured a reasonable rate to stay on the Club floor. The rooms are spacious and wonderful although the consensus from the four of us was that the beds are most disappointing for an Intercon. Especially the mattress leaves a lot to be desired, all in all the the mattress and bedding does not compare favourably to the competition like Westin's Heavenly Bed or le Meridien's beds in the Art+Tech rooms.Housekeeping standards are very high and the staff is helpful and yes smiley.The Vitality Club is great with a nice sized pool and whirlpool. Beware though that if you want to enjoy the very nice sauna and steambath area you will have to part with 鈧?5 with the exception when you stay on the Club Floor.In sharp contrast to the facilities the vitality Club staff is less than friendly and one person downright rude.The two ladies in our party were also very happy with the services and friendliness of the beauty salon.The concierge who has been there for years is knowlegable and friendly. The situation changes somewhat as his substitutes take over.Although the Club floor serves a nice breakfast we also tried the LA cafe's huge buffet breakfast it did not disappoint. Wonderful with friendly staff.We heard that Hugo's restaurant is very good. We could not get a table on saturday night. There was a waiting list of 8 tables.Our conclusion: a good hotel but they still have to work on the details and make sure the staff are retrained in the Vitality Club

<Content>Good Location Wiltshire, UK 29 August for 3 nights.An excellent breakfast shame the staff don't smile and that non smokers are put in the back , Marlenes bar is well worth a visit with friendly efficient staff. The pool with all its amenities are excellent with the jacuzzi soothing those weary sight seeing aches and pains. The concierge were unable to suggest restaurants or even suggest good shopping areas, having lived in berlin in the early 80's we went back to old shopping areas, but would have loved to venture anew. Whilst the new rooms are great getting in  out of the bath could prove precarious for the less agile, and whilst you can have a bath  watch TV you can't watch it in bed - mind you the beds have the comfort of a hospital bed with rubber mattress covers!!!!We would certainly go back just for the good location - but please interconti front desk staff smile the maids were all friendly and rooms were clean.
