<Content>First Paris trip Hotel Varenne was a great hotel for a second honeymoon and first trip to Paris. My husband and I had a superior room which was very large, comfortable and tasteful. The tub was narrow, but no other complaints. The staff was very helpful in making dinner reservations and answering questions in English. We took full advantage of the nearby metro stop and traveled most places by metro or foot, using only an occasional taxi. We had the continental breakfast a few times (one order fed both of us), but also enjoyed the great bakery just steps from the hotel.

<Content>Wouldn't hesitate to return... Loved the Hotel De Varenne, it's in a central location within walking distance of the museums and the Eiffel Tower. Handy for pretty walks along the river. Good area for restaurants. Nice and close to a couple of Metro stops if you want to travel further afield.Nice, clean, well maintained hotel with very helpful and friendly staff.Many thanks for your hospitality.

<Content>Excellent Hotel and Location This is a very pleasant and quiet hotel in an excellent location. If you are looking for exciting in-the-hotel nightlife (bars, discos, lots of flash, etc.) this isn't the hotel for you.Our room was modest, clean, well appointed and very comfortable. The staff was very accommodating to our requests and were very hospitable.I have no idea why anyone would place a review in which they indicate the Varenne is anti-American. As an American, I found the staff to be friendly regardless of my country of origin. I would disregard the review indicating anti-American sentiments. I recommend this hotel and will stay there again.

<Content>fantastic We had a four night stay here on the recommendation of TA. The hotel is in a fantastic location within walking distance of many of the city鈥檚 iconic sites. Rue de Bourgogne is a wonderful street an oasis after a hectic day of sightseeing as well as catering to the more mundane needs i.e.: supermarket across the street,bakerys coffee shops est., est.The hotel reflects all that is marvellous about Paris charming discrete, understated style.The staff were at all times helpful and friendly.The hotel added greatly to a very successful break away for us.

<Content>Loved the Hotel de Varenne This was a wonderful and cute hotel with great staff. The rooms were immaculate, the breakfast was great and the little courtyard so nice. Location was quiet, close to Embassys, federal buildings but also Museum Rodin and Hotel De Invalides were around the corner from the Hotel as well as the Metro. I would recommend this hotel anyday.

<Content>Lovely hotel, perfectly situated After staying nearly a week at the Varenne (in a twin superior room), we echo the vast majority of tripadvisor posts here: it's a wonderful hotel! It's exactly as pictured and described on the hotel website (and in tripadvisor traveler photos), with beautifully decorated rooms, as well as air-conditioning, a refrigerator and safe in the room, and pleasant, helpful people at the front desk. Our room faced the street, yet was very quiet when the windows were closed.The location couldn't be better: within walking distance of a largenumber of tourist sites (Eiffel tower, the Seine, Rue Cler, Invalides + Napoleon's Tomb, Rodin Museum, Place de la Concorde, Pont Alexandre, Champs d'Elysees, Tuileries, etc) yet the immediate surroundings are not touristy; one has the feeling of being in a typical Parisian neighborhood. There was a wonderful boulangerie a couple doors down; also on the same block were a pharmacy, a veg/fruit shop, and a small grocery store. The Paris metro is only 1/2 block away; the RER (railroad, e.g., for trips to Versailles or Vincennes Chateaux or to CDG airport) stop is about 10 min walk. We would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Charming Hotel with a Fantastic Location Just returned from a short stay in Paris. I chose the Hotel de Varenne based on positive TripAdvisor reviews and am now adding our own rave review. The location is wonderful, close to two subway stops and a range of museums and sites. The Rodin museum is just around the corner and Napolean's tomb is a brief walk. The Musee d'Orsay is a subway stop away, but we walked it; the Eiffel Tower is also an easy walk. We booked a triple since our teenage son traveled with us and the room was comfortable, a double bed and single bed, and quite spacious for Paris. The room was well furnished, quite tasteful with a stylish French flair, and my son enjoyed the very large flat screen TV. (We didn't bring our laptop, but internet is available and our son was a frequent user.) The bathrooms were spotless and modern. Our third floor room had two windows which overlooked the flowered courtyard. There is a small elevator. The owners were warm and made us feel welcome. The owners kept our luggage for us the day we arrived before check-in and even the day we left--nice touch. We walked each day to Rue Cler for breakfast, and there are local fruit stands and bakeries on the street. Some fine restaurants including La Maupertu are a short walk near Invalides. I would highly recommend this delightful hotel and will definitely stay there when we return to Paris!

<Content>exceeded exptations The hotel was perfect, exactly what we wanted,the room was spotless and tastefully decorated, the staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfasts were good. It was located within walking distance of the major attractions such as The louvre, Eiffel Tower, Invalides and many more. All the restaurants recommended by the hotel were excellent and all within a few minutes walk. Try Tante Marguerite you will not be disappointed. Look forward to staying again on my next visit to Paris.

<Content>Excellent! The Hotel was brilliant! We had excellent service all thanks to the people [receptionist, porters, maids etc] .Everyone was very helpful and polite, who also all spoke english which was very useful to us as our french is not the best.Our room was very nice and immaculate, [cleaned and tidied after we came back from our days out also]. The Hotel in my opinion is worthy of more than 3 stars.The location of Hotel de Varenne was spot on too, we did not bother using the metro/buses etc as all the sights were within walking distance.We will definitley be staying here again when we next vist Paris.

<Content>perfect small, quiet, charming hotel Stayed for 4 nights. We had a double with shower, but should have reserved a room with a bath (to ease tired muscles after hours of walking each day). Very clean with all of the necessities.A quiet neighbourhood with a variety of cafes, restaurants, bakeries, etc. - good access to the Metro. Staff were very friendly and particularly helpful when my wife took ill one night - searched out a pharmacy that was open, called a cab and even asked how she was feeling the next day.Wouldn't hesitate to return.SB Graham, Toronto

<Content>Loved the location and hotel Great location for the hotel, close to all the major landmarks. Skip the breakfast that you have to pay extra for and watch out for the extra cost of the wi-fi. Having said that though this is a great place to stay, a great comfortable bed and updated furnature and bathroom. I would stay here again. Located in a quite block in the government district and the updated double pane window cut out any moped's and cars on the street. A great little courtyard that is a good place to kick back with a bottle of wine from the market across the street and relax after a day of running around the city seeing all the sites.

<Content>Lovely Weekend Getaway You can't beat this location. I'm used to big cities in the States where you expect to be mugged on every streetcorner but staying at de Varenne was a very comforting experience since it's in the Embassy District and there are cops everywhere. It's still within walking distance of a few important sites and other stuff you can reach by metro. There's a good bakery nearby with awesome French desserts but it kept some odd (=lazy) hours. No complaints whatsoever about the room itself or the staff. We requested a room with a view and were surprised we actually got one. It was really nice to look at the lit up Eiffel tower from our bed after a long day of sightseeing. Just what we were hoping our stay in Paris would be like.

<Content>Thank you Hotel De Varenne! My 20-year-old son and I have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Hotel de Varenne, May 5-May 11. We chose it on the recommendation of friends, and were very pleased. The hotel is in a quiet area and our room overlooked the courtyard, so we were able to sleep with windows open. Our twin room with a shower was very clean, very comfortable, recently renovated, and ample space for our needs. The hotel staff, from first greeting until our departure, was first rate and very helpful. Most of our dealings were with Beatrix and Soultan. Prior to our arrival they arranged reservations for a day-trip to the Normandy and D-Day areas. They assisted with our laptop computer, and arranged for a shuttle back to the airport on the final morning. We chose to have breakfast there each morning, and it was a great start to the day. I ordered the fabulous basket of breads and jellies, juice and a pot of coffee, while my hungry son frequently ordered a la carte to get omelettes or eggs. The metro stop Varenne is very close by, along with a public telephone if you want to use a phone-card. Our most fun experience on the trip was an afternoon tour of Paris by segway, by Fat Bike Tours. Our mom and son trip was a great success, thanks in part to the Hotel de Varenne and staff. I highly recommend it.

<Content>A Trip To Remember Our stay at the Hotel de Varrenne was among one of our top travel experiences. The location of the hotel is within walking distance of all the main attractions within the city. During the evening, we took advantage of many of the great restaurants also within walking distance of the hotel. As for the hotel itself, it met all of our requirements of a friendly staff, clean and comfortable rooms, and wonderful ambience. We will surely return for our next experience to Paris to the Hotel de Varrenne and would certainly recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Excellent hotel Well located, friendly hotel. Would probably be four stars if it had more facilities. Rooms clean and well decorated. The 10 Euro breakfast was a good start to the day and would only save about 2 Euros if you chose to eat at a local patisserie. Within walking distance of many attractiions and would have no hesitation in staying there again if we re-visit Paris.

<Content>Delightful hotel We have just returned from a three night stay at this absolutely charming French hotel. Everything about it was excellent and it certainly deserved a higher rating than three stars. Our superior double room was large, with a beautiful bathroom including a separate toilet. It overlooked the lovely small french street and it was great to watch the world go by. The double glazing was most effective. The reception and breakfast staff were most helpful and the small courtyard would have been a perfect place to sit had the weather been warmer. When we return to Paris, which I am sure we will, we will certainly go back to Hotel de Varenne.

<Content>Lovely littel hotel! We stayed in this hotel end Feb - It was a lovely littel hotel - right near the eiffel tower and all the areas you need to be in.The hotel staff are lovely and very helpful. You can borrow DVDs to watch whenever you want and the staff really look after you!The immediate area has some lovely quaint restaurants and in comparison to some areas, really reasonably priced. There is a lovely little pizza restaurant just round the corner!The street the hotel is on is quiet and there arent loads of restaurants or cafes as its not very busy, however there are loads of little streets just round the corner towards the eiffel tower which is where we went a couple of times!I definitely recommend this hotel - Its reasonably priced (we got a good deal on he website) and i hadnt seen many hotels in such a good area for a price like this (our room was lovely and the hotel has been refurbished and looks brand new!)Definitely worth a stay!!

<Content>Seasoned travellers can still find a GEM! Two Couples just returned from a great visit to Paris that was even more impressive by staying at the hotel de Varenne. The hotel was ready for us and every day gave us superior service from the petit de jeuner to directions to sights and restaurants and help with our rental car to depart Paris. The day receptionist went out of her way to provide us with help that has left us with a good feeling about Paris and Parisians. All were friendly and spoke English expertly. We recommend this hotel and this location for your French experience. It was quiet , something we appreciated more each day. Thank you all for a special stay.

<Content>Super location We spent two nights at the Hotel de Varenne. Our room overlooked the small courtyard and was very clean. The double bed was extremely comfortable. The shower was good and powerful with soaps and shampoo provided together with warm towels from the heated towel rail.A flat screen TV with satellite channels completed the facilities.Breakfast was the usual continental with freshly baked baguette, pastries and preserves, fruit juice and tea or coffeee. The down side is the dining room is quite small and can become crowded.The only reason we did not rate as 'excellent' is because we waited 15 minutes sitting at an uncleared table before clearing it ourselves and getting the manager's attention for some service. The previous day we had excellent service so maybe we were just unlucky on this occasion.This hotel is ideally situated for walking to the usual Paris sights, Eiffel Tower, Place de la Concorde, even 'les grands magasins'.As this was our first visit to Paris we took advantage of L'Open Tour, an open top bus tour. We opted for the two day ticket, giving four different tours, to orientate ourselves. Unfortunately, the weather was so cold that we spent the tours inside rather than on the open upper deck. This ticket was good value at 29 Euro as against 26 Euro for a one day pass.We also tried the 'Batobus' a river boat cruise, again with the two day option. This was a very relaxed way to cruise the Seine, in a totally enclosed glass cruise boat.We travelled via Eurostar which was quick and comfortable. Buying a 'carnet' of ten tickets for the Metro was a bit excessive as we only used four because walking and the bus tours were so convenient.We will certainly visit Paris again, and will probably use the same hotel, as the location is ideal.

<Content>charming Charming boutique hotel on the south bank walking distance away from main tourist areas but far enough to feel homely. A number of local shops chemist, grocer etc cafes/restaurants on the doorstep including a cash till. Lovely hotel it is recently refurbished and fresh. I stayed in a standard room with shower - shower was great which is always a big relief in europe. Continental breakfast was included, its basic but generous and we love french breads. A la carte is also available and its well priced. The management and staff are friendly and their english is very good they made great recommendations for eating out and also booked taxis etc. This hotel will be our regular when visiting Paris.

<Content>Great Little Hotel in a Great Location This little hotel is a gem. Its location is fantastic for all of Paris and the bits tourists want to see. Arrive in the evening at Metro stop Varenne and see the Eiffel Tower Sparkle. Walk around the corner, past the Rodin Museum and you are there. Great little bistro just up the road as well. Visit the local flower and speciality shops in the morning.The hotel staff are really friendly and speak 100% perfect English.Good quality rooms with TV/SAT/DVD, Piping hot water, nice and quiet. Immaculately clean and just undergoing an outside repaint to spruce up ready for the summer season. The little courtyard is a great place for Breakfast, and they are not mean with the Croissants and Coffee :-)But don't tell everyone, as it is too good a secret to share !

<Content>Perfect location, ideal for exploring on foot Just back from a three day stay in Paris at the Hotel de Varenne. The location in my opinion could not be better. Its in a quiet part of the 7th, surrounded by lots of ministerial buildings but its a short walk to St Germain de Pres in one direction and a reasonable walk to the Eiffel Tour in the other direction. We even walked all the way to the Marais via a visit to the Louvre but that was a long walk even by our standards. The hotel itself is a good 3 star standard. Rooms are comfortable although the central heating was a little warm. The most expensive rooms are spacious, the second price level was fine - not a huge size but a nice shower room with separate toilet. On the downside breakfast is not included. My parents paid for breakfast in the hotel one day but were disappointed with quantity and quality. My recommendation is go for a coffee and croissant at one of the lovely cafes around St Germain. Also, this was my first visit to Paris in winter and its a good time to go if you want to visit the museums which are really quiet compared to peak season. And great for the January sales at Gallerie Lafayette and Printemp!For fanstastic posh nosh try restaurant 'Tante Margriette' at the beginning of Rue du Boulongne (where the hotel is) and also visit the lovely wine shop on the same street. The owner is very passionate about wine, very friendly and gave some good tips about the local area.

<Content>Elegant and yet homey! Booked directly with the hotel at their website. Excellent staff, simple but elegant breakfast served on porcelan, small yet beautiful marble bathroom, very quiet and a fantastic location. Like staying at The George V at a steal of a price.

<Content>Excellent hotel This was our second stay at the Hotel de Varenne. We were there for two nights, December 17 and 18, 2007. We stayed in a superior double on the second floor. On our previous visit, we were given the superior double on the third floor, which is more spacious, but we were very happy with this room, as well.The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower and Orsay Museum, and very quiet. There are also two bakeries and mini-markets near the hotel.The staff was very professional and courteous. We checked in on a bitterly cold night, at around 8PM. They had our key ready for us, so it only took us a minute to get to the room, which was well heated.The room itself was clean and well-appointed, and the bathroom was spacious and spotlessly cleaned everyday.We also enjoyed the Continental breakfast. At 10 Euors, it is a little pricey but filling and convenient.We will be staying at the Varenne again on our next trip to Paris.

<Content>Love the Varenne My friend and I stayed here for 2 nights in October on a stop over in Paris. We were very happy with our accommodations. It was reasonably priced for Paris and all the people who manned the front desk were very helpful and kind and made our trip more enjoyable. The hotel is quiet and our room was clean. The bathroom was small but not unexpectedly so. The hotel is also in a terrific location for walking. We had a great time and I would definitely return to this hotel. Belated thanks to all the people at the Varenne.

<Content>Always a pleasant place to stay. This small hotel is in a great location with easy access to the Metro (Varenne station) and to left bank sights. Musee D'Orse, Rodin Museum, Eiffel Tower, St Germain, San Sulpice are all within easy walking distance. The hotel is on a quiet street with a small market, excellent artisan bakery, and ATM all only a few doors away. The rooms are obsessively clean, and understated in their decoration...none of that flocked wallpaper. The whole environment and the welcome are pleasant without exception.

<Content>De Varenne is a very good hotel - and good value. Hotel De Varenne, Les Invalides, ParisWe stayed for just over a week at this very pleasant family owned hotel. The room and bathroom were lovely, and the services very efficient. The staff went out of their way to be helpful: arranging with us our train travel to Brussels; pointing out metro services (we were en greve at the time - but it worked nevertheless!); and being generally pleasant and helpful without being in anyway overbearing. They provide breakfast - and the coffee and morning breads are just delicious. The hotel is on a quiet sreet with great cafes and restaurants, and a depaneur/boulangerie so you can pick up bread and cheese and a bottle of wine if you don't feel like eating out. They also have a little courtyard - which would be fabulous in the warmer months. Finally the location is great. Just round the corner from the Concorde and really accessible to all one might want to do in Paris - on foot, in order to walk off all that delicious morning bread. We had a lovely time at the Hotel de Varenne.Roberta Ellis and Ken Beeson

<Content>Good comfortable hotel We stayed at the Varenne (we being 4 young at heart women!) for 3 nights in November. The area is quiet and handy for the metro-about 5 mins walk from Les invalides in one direction and Solferino in the other. Room was fine average for a city hotel Nice bathroom and good shower and very clean. There is a small outside garden would be nice in summer. The reception staff were a bit slow -an older gentleman who took a while to understand that we didn't all have the same name, however he was very pleasant. I'd advise going out for breakfast as the hotel does not have a proper restaurant and where they serve breakfast is tiny and you have to queue. There are plenty of nearby cafes just past les Invalides. Overall a pleasant hotel.

<Content>Nice location, friendly staff This hotel is in the active city center, just south of the Seine. It is in the center of the Eiffel Tower on the west and Notre Dame on the east (both a 20 min walk on either side), with all major attractions like the Champs Elysees, Louvre, Musee Dorsay in between. It is close to the majore Invalides station which has the RER C line to Versailles.Rooms were new and refurbished. Staff extrememly helpful - helped us book our airport coach, lent us a lonely planet guide to Paris in English, etc

<Content>Great Stay I chose the Hotel de Varenne due to another TripAdvisor review. This hotel is in an area that is populated by foreign ambassador residences and the French Ministry of Defense. So the area is very safe and well patrolled by police. Easy walking to the Eiffel Tower, Louvre, and the Museum D'Orsay, with a metro station just around the corner. The staff was excellent, and although the rooms were small, they were clean and extremely quiet. I would recommend passing on the 10 Euro continental breakfast, not because it is bad, but there is cheaper fare nearby from area bakeries and brasseries.If you want to stay in an area where there is a lot of nightlife and restaurants, try the Latin Quarter, but for a nice, relaxing, quiet stay consider this hotel.

<Content>Good long weekend break Extremely well placed a few hundred yards from Assemble National and Les Invalides and their Metro stations. Also close to Air France terminal. Quiet neighbourhood.Hotel is an old courtyard house. Rooms overlooking the courtyard are quiet. Well equiped with fridge, LCD TV etc. Bathroom appeared recently refurbished. Bed comfortable.Staff helpful, for example preparing room in one hour when we arrived early at 10.30 am, and booking taxis etc. Be carefull though, prebooked taxi was 3 times as expensive compared with one flagged down for the same trip. Breakfast is fine, but the room is small and there can be waits if several people arrive at the same time.Range of nationalities in the clients with a majority american.A quiet pleasant hotel. Will use again. recommended.

<Content>Fantastic small hotel My wife and I stayed here for six nights in January 2007 and could not have been happier. We chose the Hotel Varenne based on TripAdvisor reviews, since we did not see it in any guidebooks.The location is fantastic. We were able to walk to the Musee d'Orsay, Saint Germain des Pres, Le Bon Marche, Eiffel Tower, as well as numerous locations on the Right Bank including the Louvre and even the Arc de Triomphe. The neighborhood surrounding the hotel is quite upscale, and is full of bakeries, small markets and other shops that cater to locals, not tourists (which we saw as a plus since we saw the real Paris). Rooms were a tad on the small side, but were very pleasantly decorated, quiet, and very comfortable. The staff was fantastic, and helped with booking restaurant reservations, since our French is lousy. The breakfast in the morning consisted of pastries and breads, and was a wonderful way to start the day.Overall, we really felt at home at the Hotel Varenne, and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Quaint  We had no idea where to stay when we began planning our trip to Paris. But just in time, our local newspaper published a full-page story on small Paris hotels that were economically priced. After reviewing all of the recommendations, the De Varenne seemed the right choice for us......and it was! When we arrived and walked through the quaint courtyard leading to the sliding doors to the lobby, we were certain that our decision was perfect. Our room overlooked the sweet courtyard where we spent every evening sharing a bottle of wine and meeting others from around the world who were doing the same thing. The hotel is one block from the Rodin Museum, a short walk to the Invalides where tourists can catch the on/off tour buses, and is very conveniently located near shops, restaurants, pasterries, and markets. The staff was so very kind and helpful. We look forward to returning one day.

<Content>Great Staff at Good, Small Hotel Spent 8 nights at this hotel and must say that the staff is remarkable. Dealt with many of them and everyone was willing to help with any request and never made me feel like I was imposing. In fact, when I had a problem with my room they had the owner/director respond to me personally and his response was courteous, professional and more than satisfactory.If you do want to eat at the hotel I would recommend the a la carte menu for breakfast as a better buy than the continental breakfast.As someone who wants to see the city all day but then be able to sleep at night, this hotel was ideally located in an extremely quiet neighborhood. If you want nightlife, you can find it elsewhere, but come back to the Varenne for a peaceful night's sleep. But if you like to sleep with your windows open as I do, be warned that like most European hotels there are no screens and we did battle mosquitoes a couple of nights.The size of the room was servicable and the bathroom was very big by any standard. The bathroom could have used a little sprucing up; some cracks/peeling in the paint due to the steam from the shower (no shower curtain or enclosure). The housekeeping service was attentive with one exception - had to ask for more soap and shampoo; they weren't replaced as a matter of form.The Paris metro is sensational and the hotel is located very close to the Varenne metro stop. Also an incredibly short walk to the Rodin Museum. We even walked to the Eiffel Tower more than once.As for dining, you can take Rue Grenelle over toward the Eiffel Tower to find several wonderful options starting at Boulevard de la Tour Marbourg and beyond, which we did practically every night.Right on the same street as the hotel, just a few steps away are a bank, small supermarket, fresh fruit stand, bakery, dry cleaner and pharmacy and around the corner is a post office - all your needs are covered.I think it added immensely to stay at this small, boutique style hotel than a major chain. I would recommend the Varenne and would stay there again.

<Content>A Very Special Place I first found this hotel several years ago surfing the web, and booked a room for three nights. From the moment I entered the courtyard, I knew I had discovered something very special. Every aspect of my visit then, and every time I've visited since, has been infused with serenity. The staff is superbly professional and discrete, yet warm and friendly. Beatrix, Bita, Sultan, Valentine, and Mr. Pommier are people that I have come to know and look forward to seeing every year. The rooms are of varying sizes and kept immaculate. The neighborhood is quiet and centrally located to all the sites one comes to Paris to see. After a long day of visiting Paris, it is lovely to come back to Hotel de Varenne and rest in the courtyard or the salon. If you want to keep abreast of the world you left behind, there is an ample supply of daily newspapers, including the International Herald Examiner, or, of course, CNN or BBC World on the flat screen television in your room. Each time I have been to Hotel de Varenne I request, and receive, a room on the First Floor facing the courtyard. I love the large casement windows. When I first went to Paris I was told to stay in a chain hotel, which I did for the first couple of times because I didn't know any better. After having discovered Hotel de Varenne I can't conceive of staying elsewhere. It has become part of the entire Parsian experience for me. As long as Mr. Pommier is the proprietor, and as long as Beatrix is assisting him, I know I will not stay elsewhere. I would recommend to anyone going to Paris to stay at Hotel de Varenne. You will not be disappointed.

<Content>Four years at the Hotel de Varenne! In January, it will have been four years since our first stay at our now- favorite Parisian hotel. We've stayed in every type of room (if not every room, in fact!) and have recommended Hotel de Varenne to many friends over those years. The verdict is unanimous: Hotel de Varenne is a jewel. It is intimate, pretty, friendly, well-appointed without being grand, clean, welcoming, tranquil, and, in spite of the dismally weak American dollar, affordable.We love the de Varenne's location in the 7th arrondissement, on and of the Left Bank, but just a few steps away from the Place de la Concorde, the Tuileries Gardens, and other treasures of the Right Bank.The staff are helpful and kind. Beatrice has become a friend I am always so happy to see when I return to our Parisian home away from home. Soultan is unfailingly polite and helpful. The staff has not changed since our first stay in January 2004, a fact that speaks very well of the hotel management.I stayed here, solo, in early September, in room 41, with its view of the Eiffel Tour (the top half, anyway!) and the hotel's bijoux courtyard. My husband and I are returning for several days in November. And then, it's on to our fifth year at the Hotel de Varenne. You could say we're fans.

<Content>A perfect sanctuary in Paris We just spent 8 fantastic days in Paris and stayed at the charming Hotel de Varenne because of the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. The reviews were right on. The staff was great, including multilingual and helpful Beatrix and the night man we called Alfred (cuz he looked like Bruce Wayne's butler).The rooms (Superior) was spacious with a comfortable king size bed, easy WiFi access (12Euro for 24 hrs of on time) and large modern bathrooms with full size bath and shower.The hotel is located in the quiet 7th district. This is mostly government offices so after 5 it is nice and quiet. The Metro is a 5 min walk and Les Invalides is about the same distance.There is a fully stocked mini grocery store across the street and an upscale wine store a little further down. Pastry shops and cafes are nearby.We ended up ignoring the advice to avoid the breakfast and chose to eat in the hotel and get it out of the way. Although the continental breakfast, at 10 Euro, is a bit steep, for 6 euro you could get 2 eggs, coffee and the ever present baguette. Not a bad deal and no leaving the hotel required.The rooms were air conditioned so you can close the windows at night. The windows were all new, so street noise was minimal.And at the end of a long day of looking at wacky French art, make sure you plan to meet in the cozy Varenne courtyard with a bottle of St. Estaphe, a wheel of stinky fromage and yes, a baguette. (and throw a few crumbs to the resident pigeon, who we named Abindicator)All in all, a great, charming hotel at a decent price. We will come back.

<Content>Great location; OK rooms This hotel is in a fantastic location in St. Germain. Very short stroll to Louvre, Notre Dame, D'Orsay and the street life of the district. The hotel was very quiet and the staff was really nice. They secured Priority Passes to the Louvre for us on very short notice. The rooms are VERY small; tiny in fact...but clean. The lounge/bar is a nice bonus in the evening.

<Content>Wonderful Experience This was our first time to Paris and we were celebrating our anniversary. We had spent hours looking through the hotels on-line and couldn't seem to find one that was close to the center of town, had nice amenities that wasn't going to cost us a fortune. We also were seeking good service as we do not speak french. Hotel de Varenne was perfect! We really enjoyed our room overlooking the garden/patio; it was very clean, nice bathroom, quiet, had a fridge and one morning we even smelled the baking of fresh pastries! We walked everywhere from the hotel and enjoyed a few very nice dinners that were close by as well. All of the staff we met there provided friendly service and were very helpful answering our questions and booking dinner reservations. They have a computer available for guests, umbrellas if it rains, breakfasts and can easily call taxis for you as well. We would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking to veer away from the 5 stars...we would certainly go back.

<Content>Absolutely Wonderful My girlfriend and I recently spent 6 nights at the Hotel de Varenne, and were very pleased with our pick of hotels. The hotel is on a rather quiet street in a quiet area of the city. This makes it very easy to unwind at night after a long day of exploring the city. The room we had was a standard double with a shower, and it was in very good shape. It was extremely clean and well kept. The bathroom was in excellent shape with a separate WC. The room itself would be considered small for people used to American hotels, but by European standards, it seemed like a standard size room. There was a flat screen TV with quite a few stations, and a DVD player in the TV. However, I don't know why somebody would choose a hotel in Paris based on the TV since it won't be watched much.The hotel is located within a five minute walk to the Invalides, which is where Napolean's tomb is, and about 2 minutes from the Musee de Rodin. There is also a metro station on the same block which made it extremely convenient and easy to get around the city.Most importantly, the staff was wonderful. The staff is who make the hotel what it is. Every staff member was extremely polite and made every effort to help us with whatever we needed. They also served an excellent continental breakfast which jump started our day of sightseeing. I would recommend this hotel to anyone without reservation and would more than likely stay here again.

<Content>Tranquil city hotel Just come back from 6 nights here with my wife and I in a superior double and our 2 boys (11 and 12) in a standard twin. The location has a LOT going for it if you're not used to city (or town for that matter) noise. We live in a rural location with no noise or street light at night, so finding somewhere that we can get a good night's sleep is very important to us and the Varenne certainly does that. The combination of a quiet area, a quiet street within that area and being tucked into a courtyard all help.Check was quick and simple (although I always understood that in customer service protocol it was a good idea to stand up to welcome someone?) and the lift small lift can just about take 2 people and a suitcase. Small but elegant reception area and the whole place has a cared-for feel about it. The hotel's own pics are a good representation of what you'll actually get. Our superior double (room 38) was larger than the boys' twin (25) although the sloping ceiling did mean that a good part of the floor area was either not really usable or could be walked under only with a severe stoop. I lost count of our combined total of head-bumping incidents!Good size and good quality double bed and linens. Very well appointed bathroom and separate WC in both rooms - all immaculately clean and look quite recently installed. Like most hotels they change towels only when you want for 'green' reasons, but sinks don't have plugs so you end up using a lot of extra water unnecessarily. Not quite sure how this fits in to a sustainability agenda?Large flat screen TV in each room - a huge Samsung multi-speaker set up in ours with DVD player too - a big hit with the kids, although it did rather dominate the room.Friendly staff and generous breakfasts served at a leisurely pace (until midday too!) either inside or in the courtyard, or in your room if you want.Location is ideal if you're happy to walk to get around or using the Metro. If you want to be able to stagger back from a heavy night this is not the hotel for you as apart form a small supermarket and shops and 3 or 4 restaurants, there's not much in the immediate area other than embassies and offices. I think the thing we missed most was the ability to get a coffee, tea or cold drink in the hotel other than at breakfast. Most UK rooms have tea and coffee making materials in the rooms and when a hotel doesn't have any bar or room service, and there's nothing in the immediate local area, this is a bit of a drawback.However that's minor niggle comared to everything else about this place and we'd certainly stay there again for a similar holiday.

<Content>We'd Stay Here Again 鈥淢y wife and I just returned from a three week vacation in France. The last three nights were at the Hotel de Varenne. The hotel was perfectly situated for everything we wanted to do in Paris--visit the left bank, the Rodin Museum, the Bon Marche deparment store, and the Orsay Museum. The nearest metro stops (Varenne and Assemblee Nationale) were several blocks away but still conveniently located. We were also in walking distance of some very good restaurants--L'Epi Dupin (near Le Bon Marache), and Florimond (on Ave. de La Motte-Picquet very near Les Invalides). Our room was quite spacious, very clean, air conditioned, and pleasantly decorated. The gentlemen at the front desk couldn't have been more helpful. They helped us with newspapers, taxis, and ordering a shuttle to take us to the airport on the day of our departure. Breakfast in the outdoor courtyard was plentiful but there were other options near by as well. We have stayed in other hotels in Paris in the same appoximate price range but de Varenne is the one we will return to.鈥?br/>

<Content>Great 3* htotel in a quiet location As a 3* hotel it is hard to fault. It's convenient for many of the sites in Paris. The immediate area around the hotel is a bit quiet and dull. You have to walk at least 10-15 mins to get to a lively area with bars  restaurants. That aside it's one of the nicest 3*s I've stayed in in Paris.

<Content>A lovely Paris hotel We enjoyed our stay here very much. The staff were friendly and helpful. The location is excellent, within walking to Place de Concorde, Eiffel Tower, Orangerie, Musee D'Orsey and many other great places to visit. We felt safe here as it is close to the National Assembly. Although the room was small we were only there to sleep and there was a mini fridge in the room that kept our wine cold. A pretty courtyard was nice to sit in and have an afternoon glass of wine and baguette purchased at the local bakery. A wonderful bakery and grocery store are close by as are wonderful resturants. The rooms are clean, the breakfasts were excellent even though it was a continental. We would recommend this lovely hotel to any one wanting good service and a central location.

<Content>Tranquil retreat Our family of four (including 10- and 13-year-old boys) stayed here for 4 days at the end of June. The hotel does not have connecting rooms, but we had two rooms next to one another at the back of the first (second) floor and felt as if we had our own little wing. As other reviewers have described, the rooms were spacious by European standards, nicely decorated, comfortable beds and linens, nice bathrooms. Couldn't have asked for more in that regard. Our rooms overlooked the lovely courtyard, which was very tranquil. A nice place to peruse your guidebooks while having a late afternoon wine and cheese break, as I observed one couple doing. We did notice that, because of the courtyard's enclosed nature, sound traveled quite easily up from the courtyard as well as from room to room. (For instance, with the windows open, we could hear our kids talking in their room next door.) However, during our stay, the hotel was very quiet (except for my family!) and we were never bothered by outside noise.Based on reviews here and elsewhere, we chose this hotel for our first stay in Paris because it was important to us to have a quiet place to return to at the end of a day out in the city. We got what we wished for--almost too much so! We arrived on a Saturday and the neighborhood was nearly deserted for the weekend. We had trouble finding open restaurants nearby on both Saturday and Sunday nights. Once Monday came around, it was like a different place, as the neighborhood is home to many government offices. There are grocers, patisseries, and fruit markets along the street, selling delicious (and expensive!) treats. The neighborhood is pleasant to walk around, but if you are looking for a lively neighborhood, with lots of street life, this is probably not the best location in which to base yourself.Once inside the hotel, all is quiet. I know that most people would find this very pleasant (and I'm not complaining!), but as a family travelling with two not-always-quiet boys, we sometimes found it a bit oppressive. Even at breakfast, guests seemed inclined to speak in hushed tones. So, just a warning that it might not be the best option for anyone travelling with young children.Recent reviews here have mentioned the helpful staff, but I'm sad to say that we did not find this to be the case. This is my one main complaint with the hotel and would be a serious consideration in whether I would ever stay here again. One of the reasons we decided to stay in a hotel during our first trip to Paris, rather than to rent an apartment, was because we wanted to be able to get information on local restaurants, the Metro system, shops, etc. Of the 4 or 5 desk staff we dealt with during our stay, only one could be considered friendly and somewhat helpful. When we were having trouble finding restaurants open on the weekend, and we specifically asked the man at the desk for suggestions, he just motioned with his hand that there were many restaurants over that way. This may not be the best place to stay if you are in Paris for the first time and are hoping to get advice from the staff about things to see and do. In the lobby, I didn't notice any maps or literature around for tourists. Though there were many tourists, mostly American, at the hotel during our stay, I had the impression that the hotel sees itself more as catering towards those who are on business in the area.Lastly, the subject all reviews must deal with: the breakfast! We chose to have breakfast at the hotel each day; it was just easier for us. People complain about paying 10 Euros but, unless you really are only going to buy a cup of coffee and a croissant, in that neighborhood, you really aren't going to save any money. You will save time, however! The breakfast room is small and we had to wait about 10 minutes one day for a table to open up. Even when we were the only ones in the room, service was quite leisurely, so don't expect a quick bite and a gulp and go! There is a standard continental breakfast, but also a junior version (6 Euros), and many a la carte options, including eggs. No complaints with the food; it was very tasty and more than ample. And you can walk a few doors down for the most delicious fruit to accompany your breakfast! For the jetlag set, another plus is that breakfast is available until midday, which we gratefully took advantage of the first morning of our arrival.This is a lovely hotel, as many reviews have noted. We wanted a quiet place, and that's what we got. My only complaint would be the less-than-friendly staff.

<Content>Great find! Very Romantic! This was a wonderful place to stay for a first time in Paris! It is a beautifully renovated mansion. It is walking distance from the Arc de Triumph, Eiffel Tower, and the great shopping on the Champs Elysses. It has relatively spacious rooms with big windows, AC, flat screen TV, nice wood furniture, and a gorgeous bathroom, all new marble. Good price too. The only downside was that the a few of the staff members at the desk were not very helpful for first timers in Paris. My boyfriend and I managed to make it anyways. It is also right around the corner from 2 major metro stations, very convenient! This place was worth it and we will return. It made for a wonderfully romantic stay in an enchanting city!

<Content>Lovely A lovely little hotel, tucked away in a quiet street, but convenient for the city centre, restaurants, shops and museums.My room on the second floor was small but well designed and comfortable, and included flat screen TV, safe, fridge (not minibar), aircon and, even better, windows that opened onto the quiet courtyard, plus a great shower. Breakfast in the courtyard was simple but very good (and not bad value for a Paris hotel) and there was internet access in the lounge. Therefore, everything I needed for a short business trip.I'd certainly stay here again.

<Content>Quiet, Convenient Location Our family of four, including two teenage daughters, just returned from a 8 night stay at the Varenne. The hotel is on a quiet street which is convenient to many sites and the metro. We booked two rooms (a double and a twin bed) facing the courtyard. The double was small, but perfectly adequate for our two daughters.We did not eat breakfast at the hotel as we thought 10 Euros per person was a bit high, so we picked up pastries at one of the excellent bakeries on the street. We appreciated having a refrigerator in our room to store water, drinks, etc. which we purchased from the store across the street.The only downside to the hotel is the fact that it IS in a very quiet location with many government buildings. On our next trip, we would probably stay in an area like the Marais which is a bit livelier, and which has more restaurants and activities.

<Content>Elegant Hello,we just got back from our trip to Paris and thought I would post on the two hotels we stayed at while there.This hotel was located in the district where the embassies are located. ON a narrow street boarded by large embassy complex's and Rouden Museum just up the street the invalides park just two blocks away. Charming area, very quiet. A long narrow street, boarded by small shops and including two small mom and pop grocery stores.The room we booked was on the 2nd floor. It was large and the window opened on to a view of other ( we assumed homes) not a bad view at all. the room was largest of the two hotels in Paris we lodged at and the 2nd largest of the three hotels for our whole trip. The bathroom was large and had lovely tile and amenities the shower was thought not large was roomy enough with a shower curtain closure. Soaps and Shampoos were better quality then at the other hotels, large towels of nice quality and in the winter the towel rack must be designed to heat the towels up, nice touch. The whole bathroom was tiled, it was elegant looking.The room had besides nice furnishings, a thin, mounted TV, with cable with two channels for those that miss their CNN or BBC, English speaking TV. Adequate hair dryer in the bathroom. A safe, and a refrigerator as well. The closet lighted up the interior when it was opened and had shelf's and room to hang clothing. There was also a stand to place ones luggage on, rather then have ones bags on the floor.The bedding covers were nice, as were the linens for the bed and mattress and pillows were comfortable. all matched the decor nicely.When you enter the hotel it has a garden entrance with small table to sit at and read or eat a snack, or write home. The hotel had breakfast , the usual fair for Paris hotels, but we skipped that to eat at the local bakeries and restaurants. The other guests ate breakfast and the food appeared to look good. The first floor contained the lobby which was quaint and a breakfast eating area. The lift goes to the upper levels and well as there is a carpeted stairs to the upper floors.We had one hot day on our trip , and we were at this hotel and the air conditioner worked well. Individual units for each room. So you could adjust the air to ones choosing. It was quiet area, we enjoyed our stay there and would go again. \for those that are disabled it would be a good choice as there is space for either a wheel chair or electric wheel chair to be stored and no stairs to climb, and the larger rooms size and bathroom would be plus.The staff were nice and helpful, but not as friendly as the first hotel we used, I would say they were more gracious in manner when helping the guests. Not snooty, just more reserved in manner. Always a smile. It was some what a little more elegant place, compared to our other hotel. I was told they accommodate many visitors that have business at the embassies near by, that might account for the more reserved tone of the hotel, but don't get me wrong, the staff was still very nice.It is still a thumbs up choice. The walk to the Eiffel tower , about 2 miles in distance.The Museum D'Orsay was also close, about the same distance. There are several restaurants several blocks over with outside dining .In all we were glad we had two slightly different experiences with the hotels we chose, This hotel was a good choice to bring back some fond memories of Paris.I know many say you don't go to Paris to see the room, but to wake up and go to bed at night or take a break during the day for us it was nice to have a little ambiance of Paris in our commendations as well. I hope someone finds this helpful when making their choice when going to Paris.As I found the reviews here on tripadvisor a real plus when making our choices as to where to stay.Barbie

<Content>Loved this Sweet Little Hotel The hotel was perfect for my daughter and I. It was in a very very safe area(government district with police presence on just about every corner). The rooms had a safe and refrigerator plus tv with built in DVD. The rooms were air conditioned......and the bed very comfortable!! The front desk staff(not really a front desk as the lobby is very small) were great........helpful with directions, etc. It was within a 5 minute walk to the metro.....Varenne(Line 13) and just a stones throw from a great bakery....watched the baker make bread each morning. The hotel was about a 25 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and 10 minutes to the Rodin Museum. If I can answer any questions please contact me at dls5775@aol.com. I would not hesitate to stay here again!!Dana in VA

<Content>Great service, lovely room. The Hotel de Varenne is near the Hotel des Invalides and the Musee de Rodin. The front desk staff were brilliant - very helpful and professional. A dvd player and the free hire of dvds from the hotel was great. In the drawer next to the bed in my room was a copy of the yellow pages including a street directory. This enabled my husband and I to find places of particular interest to us very quickly. I will recommend this place to other people I know who are intending to visit Paris

<Content>good value, great location Spent two nights at beginning of our France trip and one night at the end of the trip at Hotel de Varenne. Hotel was very centrally located for tourist locations - walked everywhere we went. Felt safe in the neighborhood even late at night. Although not a luxury hotel, the hotel met all our needs: friendly, helpful, English-speaking staff; very clean room with recently renovated bathroom; easy walking distance from attractions, and not overpriced. Ate breakfast at the hotel one morning (most of the area patisseries seem to be closed on Sunday morning) - standard French breakfast - pastries, bread, and jam - good quality and comparably priced to our other breakfasts. Overall I highly recommend the hotel - would return.

<Content>Great little hotel I booked two rooms for three nights for our three night stay in Paris. This was the end of a 17 day trip to France and Italy and we found this hotel to be the perfect end to a great trip. The staff were fluent in english and had a good knowledge of restaurants and directions getting around Paris. The hotel was clean, quiet and within walking distance of the major sights in Paris. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Nice little hotel I stayed in this hotel. It was very little, but quiet, nice, spotless.You even had a dvd player in the room, so bring your dvds with you. Room was a little bit tiny, but guess this is normal for Paris. Bath was new and with bath tube.There was no minibar in the room, you had to go to bed thirsty.People at the desk were helpful and friendly.Worst thing about the hotel is that you don't find any parking, and if you find one it will be more than expensive. But good area and walking distance to the tower.I payed about 120 鈧?for a night and would stay there again.

<Content>Great location We booked the Hotel de Varenne based on the Trip Advisor reviews. We used the RER to get there (Line B from CDG changing to Line C at St. Michel toward Invalides). This cost us 6.8 Euro apiece. Then it was about a 5 block walk to the hotel. This worked for us because we had carry on rolling luggage only but it wouldn't work for people with more luggage or those who couldn't walk well. You could take a taxi from Invalides if you wanted to but it would still be difficult to navigate through the train stations if you had a lot of luggage. We opted for the shuttle for the return trip as we had an early morning flight. Francesca at the desk arranged this (34 Euro for both of us) and then we asked her to confirm it the evening before. That worked out very well and we were at the airport in plenty of time. Actually we had excess time since Air France was late as usual.When we arrived at the hotel we were able to check in early which was very nice since we had come in from an all night flight. We had been confirmed with a courtyard view room but we were given a street view room. When I pointed this out to Francesca, she said there had evidently been a mix up and said there were no courtyard rooms that evening but there would be the next two evenings and that she would move us. She did move us to a higher floor with a street view room which was fine and we decided that it wasn't worth moving the next night to the courtyard room because there was very little noise from the street.One of the best things about this hotel is the location. It is on a very quiet street which is convenient to many sites, the Batobus, shops and the metro. The only downside we found as far as the location was that many of the restaurants were closed on the weekends. We ate at the Japanese restaurant down the street twice which was very good and reasonable in price. We at the restaufant Tante Marguerite the first night and I would not recommend it...it was very expensive with mediocre food with small portions. We ate breakfast at the hotel the first morning for 10 euro each. We thought this was a little high for a couple of croissants and bread and tea, chocolate or coffee but it tasted fine and was convenient. The other two mornings we bought our own pastries at a bakery down the street.We really liked it that the hotel was in a quiet area (near government buildings). It felt very safe and since there were big crowds everywhere else we went, it was nice to have someplace to go that wasn't full of people.The staff was very helpful and friendly and I would recommend it for a stay in Paris.

<Content>Very nice, comfortable and clean little hotel I spent days looking at hotel reviews on Trip Advisor and finally settled on Hotel de Varenne. The room was very nice, not too cramped, and very clean and well appointed. We had a regular twin and our friends had booked a superior twin--more space--but as nice as my room. The people at the front desk were pleasant and helpful. Location near the musee d'orsay was convenient--also not to far from the Louvre and the St. Germain area. Would stay there again.

<Content>Great location The hotel is in an excellent location. Nice and quiet and much more calm than the Latin quarter we usually stay in. It does take some transferring on the Metro and RER to get almost anywhere if that is your means of transit. This could be a problem if you are coming from the airport with bags as many stations only have stairs.The staff is friendly and helpful although do not expect a concierge who can make suggestions and book dining and site seeing. They do speak English and will call for you if you do the research first. There are many restaurants and cafes in the area so we never opted for breakfast in the hotel. It is also located walking distance from Rue du Bac where there is an excellent up-scale modern food store. Also there is Ryst Dupeyron, the best Armagnac shop in Paris where you can taste many old vintages and ports. The rooms do have small refrigerators which was nice especially for keeping that cheese and water cold. There is a small courtyard with chairs and tables at the hotel entry which we used to have our wine and cheese.Be prepared that each room has a heating/cooling unit mounted high on the wall in a corner. They mounted the controls under the unit so you have to get on a chair to make adjustments - which is problematic especially in the dark if you want to change the settings. There are also no instructions as to how to use the controls so you may want to ask.All in all I would stay there again.

<Content>Quiet, convenient location Stayed here for 4 nights with my teenage daughter. Had a wonderful experience. Room was small, typically parisian, but very clean and new. Lovely bathroom. We overlooked the courtyard, room #35. Desk staff were proficient in English even though we both spoke French. Continental breakfast for Euros 10. Lovely lady served us each morning. Great location, just a few minutes from a Metro stop, or convenient if you don't mind walking. We didn't need heat or A/C during our visit, but both were available. Had a small problem with their credit card machine at checkout, but once it rebooted all was well. Would definitely recommend.

<Content>Just what we needed We were looking for something clean (my wife has allergies), in a safe part of town, close to attractions or transportation and at a reasonable cost. We usually stay at Hampton Inns. We were very happy with our choice of this hotel. The staff was very helpful. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel because we are not big breakfast eaters and because we wanted to get going in the morning. We found two pastry shops and two small grocery stores within two blocks. The Metro trip to the Louvre was easy. The first afternoon we walked to the Musee d'Orsay and then took a dinner cruise that left from the dock on the Seine behind the Musee, La Marina de Bercy.

<Content>Very Pleased With This Hotel! This is a lovely hotel in an excellent location. We had the least expensive room, at 127 euros per night, and it was very small. It was comfortable and spotless, however, and the bathroom was relatively spacious. The staff was exceptionally polite and helpful. I would stay here again without hesitation.

<Content>Nice cosy little hotel in busy Paris Usually I always go to the same hotel in Paris, but decided after reading the review from fellow TAs to try this one out.It's actually a nice and cosy hotel, in a cool neighborhood (Invalides). It's very clean, the rooms are very nice but small (OK. who spends time in his room when in Paris ?) For a 3 star hotel, the price/quality ration is very good (hidden gem ? Maybe).Why not a rating of 5 then ? Mainly because the breakfast isn't that special (this is a standard breakfast in Paris, you can also get it in any bistro or caf茅), and also because I hate being waken up early by workers on the floor above...

<Content>Perfect for average Paris tourist Stayed here for 5 nights in Aug 2005. This place is 3 star and perfect for what the average tourist needs who wants to retire at the end of the day to peace and quiet. It is situated in the Government district of the city which is not only quiet at night but also full of fine buildings. Eiffel Tower is only a short walk away too. Literally a few minutes walk around the block is a Metro station as well. Rooms are great with all the necessaries - TV, safe, clean bathroom, reasonable space. We stayed on top floor at the back (no view at the front anyway and probably noisier there as well). The breakfast was by far the best we tasted in the whole 2 weeks we stayed in France, which also included three BBs. Had a sneak view of a bigger room and it seemed ok for families. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>paris please and thank you a lovely charming place. the service was fine and they had just hired a gentleman who made sure we had coffee the morning we had to leave (so very early)!!!- the others who worked there knew of the locations of restaurants and they also set us up with the perfect new Years Eve dinner! the rooms are typically parisienne in their size--so make sure you ask for the size you prefer! we had no complaints. And we had previously been to two boutique hotels-- Neither of those had internet access and one had poor lighting! we would recommend it again, and we are picky!

<Content>Peaceful,Posh and Good Value My husband and I have just returned from a holiday trip to Paris. After mind boggling searches for the PERFECT hotel.,I think I have found it. Hotel de Varenne is sophisticated without being pretentious. Staff helpful and courteous. Great location.Very peaceful nights sleep. Pleasantly surprised by the bathroom size as I'd been lead to believe all hotel bathrooms in Paris are tiny. I hope to return to Hotel de Varenne to enjoy this lovely place again.

<Content>Excellent value for money We stayed in this hotel from 29th Dec to 1st January. The hotel is small and the staff are very friendly. The room we stayed in was larger than we expected and was extremely clean and comfortable. As other people have stated, the hotel is in a quiet location but is in easy walking distance to other livelier areas of the city. It is also a short walk to the nearest metro station. Considering what some of the other hotels were charging in Paris, I would consider this hotel to be excellent value for money.

<Content>Quiet haven in Paris My mother and I stayed in Hotel de Varenne just before Christmas 2006. We wanted a hotel in a quiet and safe area, within walking distance of the city centre (St German des Pres etc.), and not too expensive.Hotel de Varenne proved to be just that. We booked the winter special offer (129 euro per room, breakfast included) and for that price, we got an authentic, nicely furnitured and comfortable place to stay; a quiet haven from the moment you walk into the entrance garden.Initially, we had a room on the fourth floor based on our miscommunication, but the staff was more than helpful to transfer us to the second floor; less stair-climbing and somewhat spacier.Considering the price, the room was good: nice furniture, excellent badroom and well ventilated. Not much view since we booked a room on the courtyard, but we had absolutely no traffic noise at night. Only the polyester blankets we considered out of date and not too clean, but this was not a great problem.Breakfast is (like in almost every hotel of this pricerange) typically French: tea, coffee or chocolate, orange juice and a basket of bread. If you don't expect an English hotel breakfast buffet, then it's all very fine.The hotel lies in the eastern part of the 7th Arrondissement, a very safe and well-heeled neigbourhood, with some nice restaurants quite nearby. We particularly recommend Le Ferme de Saint Simon (in the Rue de St Simon), a lovely restaurant with very kind staff, however somewhat expensive.Even late at night, this area is very safe, also for two women alone. You can walk to St Germain des Pres (twenty minutes) or to the city centre via the Tuileries (half an hour). There are also two metro stations nearby. If you want a quiet place to stay in a authentic, charming hotel on a moderate budget, Hotel de Varenne is just the right place to you.

<Content>Paris perfect! My daughter and I stayed in the Varenne for 4 nights in Sept 06.We had a wonderful stay.The hotel is in a quiet neighbourhood with plenty of daytime activity because parisiens actually live there.The hotel was a sanctuary after a hectic days activities.Open top bus(fantastic and our main means of transport) stop close by as is the beautiful Rodin Museum.Lovely little shops close by and everyone so friendly (which is a first for me in the 12 or so times I have been there).I think this is because it is not a tourist area.The staff are fairly cool but I think this is the french way of not intruding ,so I had no problem with it.Every request was politely met.The room was quaint ,clean,fridge a bonus, big bathroom with bath!!!!!!! and lovely big windows opening onto greenery .We slept with the windows open every night.We loved it and finally after all these yearsI love Paris too!

<Content>Quality at a bargain price. The Varenne is a real find. A clean, safe and really very pleasant hotel in central Paris, for a fraction of the price you'd expect. The rooms are small but spotless, the outdoor breakfast area is really nice and the location is ideal.I'll definitely be back

<Content>Best value for your Euro We had stayed at the Varenne 10 years ago, and were so pleased to find it even better than before. The decor is pleasant, the rooms are smallish but comfortable and clean as a whistle, baths up to date, but most of all the location is perfect. Centrally located at the edge of the 7th arr., easy walking distance to the Musee d'Orsay, the Rodin Museum, the Invalides, Grand Palais etc. etc. Close to a metro station. Most of all, the concierge/receptionist, Beatrix, is a gem. Multi lingual, very helpful, went out of her way to anticipate our needs, helped us find locations with a map of the city, lent us guidebooks, suggested restaurants and booked for us - all with a smile. We believe that the Varenne must be one of the best values for the money in Paris, an expensive city. We have recommended it to friends, and certainly would stay there again ourselves.

<Content>a perfect small hotel My wife and I stayed a couple of nights at Hotel de Varenne beginning of october and were very pleased. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. Our room was very elegant. A little small but this is probably french standard. We loved the ambience, the garden and the location in the peaceful 7th arrondisement. The staff of this hotel deserves every compliment. We shall never look for another hotel in Paris! This is the place to be when we return.

<Content>Excellent hotel and location We stayed at the Hotel de Varenne beginning of october for 3 nights. We did a lot of research on Paris hotels prior to our trip and found that the Varenne is an excellent value compared to other hotels in Paris. Perfect location, away from the crowds, in a residential neighborhood, but close to St. Germain, the Orsay, Louvre and Rodin. The standard of the room was excellent, relaxing, very clean and the bed extremelly comfortable. The service was very good. Friendly helpful staff, assisted us on numerous occasions with reservations and other matters.We warmly recommend this place to anybody. The value is probably one of the best you can find in Paris, you really feel at home at Le Varenne. I would certainly want to stay there again!!

<Content>Mediocre We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of september - Hotel was ok in that location is fine, though very quiet, and you need to walk a fair bit to find a bar / restaurant open in the evening. Main issues with the hotel were that the rooms are dark and lighting very poor - Bedside lights were just about enough to be able to read by.No iron / ironing board/ totally inneffective hair dryer / no glasses in the room (plastic only which cracked easily ) Also - not at all welcoming or friendly - they get quite annoyed if you dont leave your key in ( which I dont understand as they are plastic keys anyway) and as there is only one person on reception, who also make tea // coffee etc so you can end up waiting a while for your key if they are busy. If they installed proper light and were a more welcoming it would be a big improvement - we moved on to stay in Residence Foch for the last night and would suggest that the owners of Varenne stay a night there too if they want to experience exceptional service. !

<Content>Just loved paris My family and I just completed a trip to Paris from Canada and stayed at the small hotel de Varenne at 44 Rue de Bourgogne in Paris. We booked on the net. Small in size, it makes up for that with the excellent service and pleasant accomodation and breakfast in the garden setting. While staying at the Varenne we took day trips with 'Paris trips' and were royally treated by the guides Florence and Norma . These two lovely ladies made our trip to Paris unforgettable and they are a credit to their employer. Just absolutely tops. Thanks again.Matt Thys, Lethbridge, Alberta ,Canada

<Content>Nice and classy This hotel was GREAT! We stayed four nights in the 鈥渄ouble with bath鈥? It was a little small, but typical for Paris. The Good: a) Fridge in Room: There is a little store across the street where you can get all sorts of things, and the fridge was great for keeping them in. You can get 9E Chatauneuf De Papes!!!b) Internet is cheap (1 hour for 4E). You get a little card that you log in with and it keeps track of your time throughout your stay.c) Location. Extremely safe, and much closer to attractions than I had thought. Walk down the street, turn left, and there is a great view of the Eiffel tower. Invalides is RIGHT THERE! Amazing restaurants in walking distance.d) Breakfast is perfect鈥specially when it鈥檚 free! The waiting staff is really nice too.e) The box of DVDs is great for bed time if you are like me and need something on to fall asleep. The only channel that you can get in English is CNN鈥nd nothing鈥檚 a bigger downer on vacation than CNN.The Bad:a) REALY quiet (Area and Hotel). It鈥檚 the kind of place where you feel like you have to whisper in the tiny lobby. This could be a plus for some people. The street is DEAD past 10:00pm.The Ugly:a) The receptionist lady that works during the day was the only person in all of Paris that was cold to us. She warmed up quite a bit by check out. We think that it might have been because of the fact that my wife and I traveled with large back packs, and she probably looked at us like student back-packers, which I imagine is not their intended customer base. Everyone else was very kind to us.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We have just returned from a 3 night stay at The Hotel de Varenne. The hotel is located on a quiet little street, which we found quaint. The room was a reasonable size, well maintained and equipped with a flat screen TV, DVD player and fridge. We found the location ideal, within walking distance from most of the major sites. The hotel staff were very courteous and dealt with all our enquiries very efficiently. Overall we would definitely stay at this hotel on our next trip to Paris.

<Content>Can't beat it! I can't say enough about the Varenne. This was the perfect choice for a mother with teenage son. On a quiet street around the corner from the Rodin museum and the Place de Invalides - the location was perfect. We were within easy walking distance of the Eiffel tower and the Rue Clair district. All of the front desk staff were friendly and helpful and most spoke excellent English. Breakfast was nice and could be taken in room, or in the breakfast room or in the cute shaded patio area. Internet access was available for a reasonable fee. Our standard room was cozy but fine for 2, and the bathroom was spotless and modern. The furnishings were very nice and appeared fairly new. The beds were quite comfortable. Our room overlooked the little courtyard - no view, but also no street noise. Some of the rooms were quite a bit larger, so if you need more space book the deluxe. An excellent value for the money.

<Content>Nice hotel, a few glitches... My husband and I stayed at Hotel de Varenne for 8 nights. It was quiet and quaint. The courtyard is lovely and we enjoyed our breakfast there in the morning. The room was more spacious than anticipated, but cleanliness was not top grade. There was so much dust on the dark red lamp cover, I drew happy faces on it to get the cleaner's attention. The happy faces remained untouched for our entire stay. The DVD player came with the room, great free selection of movies too! but the DVD player turned out to be broken and didn't get fixed when brought to the attention of hotel staff. FInally, our flight got bumped to 8:30 am (instead of noon) and we let the manager know we would have to take a hotel room at the airport on the last night because we had to be there early and we were 1 hour away by metro. He told us that we had reserved the room and we would have to pay for it. We emphasized to him that we didn't want to leave, our flight time was changed, we had been there for 7 nights and it was 9:00 am - way before the checkout time, and we wouldn't be there for the breakfast which was included in our price. He suggested we take a taxi (about 100 E) instead of the metro (14 E for 2 people) and again stated he would charge us for the room that night regardless. We thought this was inconsiderate and insensitive. In the end, we called the airline, paid for advanced flight booking and woke up at 5:00 am to get to the airport by metro at 5:30. Overall though, we do recommend this hotel to others. It is charming and ideally located for sightseeing; just make sure you don't have a change in plans!

<Content>Inexpensive, quiet, perfect If you don't need or want the expense of fancy lobbies, huge chandeliers, etc., then this is perfect. I stayed there with my four kids (ages 10 - 17) for a week. It's a small hotel; the lobby is about the size of a bedroom and the dining room is even smaller. But it's right around the corner from the terrific Musee Rodin (sculptor of The Thinker, The Kiss, etc.), and within walking distance of Les Invalides, the Eiffel Tower, and the Rue Cler. My kids and I also walked from the hotel to places like St. Germain des Pres, St Michel (Notre Dame area), Place de la Concorde, Champs-Elysees...pretty much all the main tourist attractions are within a half-hour of walking, which is not much by Parisian standards.Comfort-wise the main things are that it has good air-conditioning in the bedrooms, the bathrooms are clean and updated and have great smooth Corian sinks (I wanted to take one home!). Like most European hotel rooms, the ones at the Hotel de Varenne are small by American standards, but the 5 of us were perfectly comfortable in two rooms. The staff is helpful and pleasant. A woman named Beatrix was particularly nice to me and my kids and gave us suggestions on where to go. The morning breakfast is included in the room rate and is the typical delicious hotel continental breakfast fare. I got very used to hot chocolate and croissants being served to me on pretty yellow and blue-flowered china.I would definitely recommend this place.

<Content>Spotless, Comfortable  We had 5 nights at Hotel de Varenne and we loved it. We booked a basic double room with shower and it was more than adequate. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom excellent. The staff are helpful and speak excellent English and breakfast is very good. The weather was beautiful and the staff were happy to arrange glasses and ice for us to have a drink in the garden. They lent us a corkscrew and generally co-operated with all our requests. Our Paris stay was at the end of a long holiday and after splashing out on dinner at the Moulin Rouge (absolutely fantastic and worth every cent) we were on a budget. The restaurants right by the hotel looked excellent but were quite expensive when converted to Australian dollars. However, a supermarket is across the road and we had delightful picnic dinners which suited us better. We have already recommended this hotel to friends visiting Paris and we will stay there again. It is very close to a Metro and we were able to access everything easily. A good, solid choice.

<Content>Perfect Gem of a Hotel We chose this hotel based on other tripadvisor reports. Stayed there July 24-30. We paid only 109 euros/night including breakfast (summer special rate). A small hotel but huge on comfort, cleanliness, and gracious hospitality. This is the 6th hotel I've stayed at in Paris and it's far and away the best 3-star value in all of Paris -- and we each stayed in the cheapest room available (single/shower only-no tub). It's also in a quiet 7e location (almost all rooms face in to courtyard, ensuring a peaceful night's sleep. Very recently completely refurbished top to bottom. Has a/c!

<Content>Loved our whole experience We stayed at this hotel and it exceeded all our expectations. We got quite a good deal and I really didn't think it was going to be a great hotel but we were pleasantly surprised. The courtyard was an Oasis in a Parisian Heatwave, where we relaxed in the shade. The staff may not have been on the reserved side, but they were there when we needed them. We had to get an English speaking Doctor to come to the hotel, which they arranged and he turned up within half an hour. Our first room was small but immaculate with a lovely veiw over the courtyard. The second room, which we were given when we extended our stay, was huge and had a view over the street and the courtyard. The hotel was cosy clean and very professional. I would definately recommend it.

<Content>Awesome Hotel! We loved it! My fiance and I travelled to Paris just a few weeks ago and loved it very much.Hotel de Varenne was just wonderful. It is situated in a very safe and upper-class neighborhood. The hotel is very close to the Eiffel Tower. The Metro is only a few minutes away as well. We actually expected the room to be much smaller, but since we were given the 147 Euro room even though we had booked the room for 127 Euros, this might be the reason for the slightly larger size of the room. The hotel has a nice courtyard where breakfast is served. We enjoyed a nice evening there as well.I can only recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Nice little hotel Nice hotel in a residential neighborhood. Very comfortable, pretty, clean rooms, yet small. It is Paris afterall. Helpful service. Make sure you have some pastries from the bakery down the block! We bought pastries every morning and took them back to the hotel patio, where we would order juice and coffee. It was very pleasant.If you don't mind having to walk a few blocks to get close to more busy areas, this is a really nice hotel.

<Content>Great value hotel We stayed at the Hotel de Varenne largely as a result of the reviews posted on this site, and I have to add that the reviews were accurate: this is an excellent hotel in a convenient location which, by Parisian standards, offers good value for money.The location is close to several of the French ministries, and is not on a main street, so is relatively quiet. The street is well served with restaurants, a small supermarket and a patissserie.The standard of cleanliness is very high throughout the hotel and, as it has recently been renovated, is also well and tastefully decorated.We stayed in room 17 (147 euros a night), which overlooked the small garden, and were pleased with the size of the room and the bathroom - it was not cramped at all. The rooms all have flat screen tv with 3 English-speaking news channels, a safe and small refrigerator. Bathrooms are equipped with a hairdryer and basic toiletries. Contrary to another report, it is possible to adjust the air conditioning.The staff were helpful and friendly, and all seemed to enjoy working in the hotel. However, we did request a taxi to be called for 8.30 am, to take us to the airport, but the staff did not call the day before, as asked, and the staff on the desk in the morning had a great deal of difficulty in locating a vehicle during rush hour.Breakfast was a resonable deal, but could be had cheaper at a local patisserie. The meal consists of tea/coffee, fruit juice, and an assorted basket of mini croissants, baguette and pains au chocolat/pains aux raisins. It is certainly sufficient for any adult with a healthy appetite. A la carte items such as cereal can also be requested at a modest price.I would not hesitate to return, or to recommend the hotel to others.

<Content>Great hotel, unfriendly staff My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for five nights. This small hotel is beautiful. We booked a superior twin with airconditioning and had a view of the street which was nice to open the balcony windows to. The only problem is the staff, the gentelman that works Monday thru Friday from 1-9 was so rude the whole trip. He was totally unfriendly and acted very bothered when we asked him for help. He was either talking on the phone and watching tv and did not to get up. He was very short and rude to me several times. Becasue of this I would not reccommend this hotel.Unhappy in Texas

<Content>We loved the Hotel de Varenne My husband and I just returned from a 10 day vacation in Paris. We stayed at the Hotel de Varenne in the 7er. We absolutely fell in love with the neighborhood and this little jewel of a hotel. Just as you have read in the othe reviews and forums here, Rue De Bourgogne has everything you need for your stay. A Patisserie next door -- delicious Quiche! -- an ATM, pharmacy, grocery stores, wine shop, book store and a couple of small restaurants are on this street. Assemblee Nationale is located at one end of the street and the Musee Rodin is at the other (across the street) so the area is very safe. There are two Metro stations nearby.We arrived at the hotel around 10:00 am and were delighted to find our room was ready for us. The room was small but very nicely decorated in provencial colors, very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was large with a tub and shower, a nice vanity and a separate water closet. We had very little noise because our room overlooked the courtyard. We stayed in Room 25.Beatrix and Soultan, hotel staff, were very courteous and helpful. Our luggage did not arrive with us (good ole United Airlines) and Beatrix and Soultan went out of their way to assist us in locating it. Beatrix also made arrangements for our side trip to Brugge, Belgium and she and Soultan arranged for taxis a couple of times. We made our request the night before and yes, they were there on time! We enjoyed the lovely courtyard area. It was a relaxing place to have a glass of wine after a long day of sightseeing. A couple of nights we just picked up something to eat and had dinner in the courtyard. Afterwards, we walked a couple of blocks to get a view of the Eiffel Tower light show. We are looking forward to our next trip to Paris and will definitely stay on the left bank at the Hotel de Varenne.

<Content>A nice hotel My husband and I stayed at Hotel de Varenne for 5 nights while we were in Paris. We picked this hotel based on the review here. We were in room 43 which looked over the front of the building. The room was the typical small room and very clean. We thought the hotel was in a very good location, and close to the metro; which made getting around very easy. The staff was friendly, and helped us when we had questions. We did feel that breakfast was not worth the cost here. For 10 euro, you would get a small basket of assorted breads, coffee and Juice. If you're looking to save a little cash, 2 doors down from the hotel, there is a great bakery and across the street from that is a nice grocery store. Since the room offered mini- refreg, we bought water, cheese, lunch meat and stuff for our bread that we got at the bakery and had that for breakfast.If we were to go to Paris again, I would probably consider this hotel again.

<Content>Decent stay We just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel, selected primarily on the basis of the reviews posted here and price (naturally). I felt it was a decent spot but not as good as the reviews have made it out to be. Our room was not available at 12:15 PM so we had to leave our bags and have lunch at a creperie down rue de Bourgogne (which was lovely, by the way). We came back an hour later and were given our key. The room was quite small (which we weren't surprised about) but relatively clean. Not that well lit, and the bathroom was very strange as it had built-in shelves that seemed very gratuitous. There was a flat screen TV and DVD player which was a nice touch, as well as a mini-fridge. Our bed was a not very comfortable double.As other reviewers have noted, the staff is not particularly helpful as far as restaurants although they did give my husband a little map of the area with marked places on it. They also helped him find a place to get some takeout soup for me as I was ill. Also they did not replace our soap or even the plastic cups used for water after I threw them away one night, which I think is a pretty basic thing to expect.The other frustrating thing about the location is that although you are nearly close enough to the Hotel des Invalides metro stop, the closest one is actually the Varennes stop, which is not on a major line. We did a lot of transferring to get to this line, although to be fair, you really could just walk most of the time. We walked from the hotel to St. Germain de Pres and the Eiffel Tower, although they might be far for some people. To summarize I would say it was a decent stay although I wouldn't be likely to seek it out again - will probably try another similarly priced, better located three star and see how we make out.

<Content>Nice Paris Hotel We stayed at Hotel de Varenne after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. We very satisfied with the hotel and would stay there again as a fall back should we not find something better.Location: Metro station is fairly close. Varenne is on the opposite side of the block, so it鈥檚 a 6 or 7 minute walk to the entrance. The hotel is located on a fairly quiet street 鈥?minus garbage day and when the police go whizzing by. We did notice a fair amount of foot traffic, yet felt very safe. Nearest shops and bars are located all along the street of the hotel. Great food shops and a pharmacy just down the street. The last little grocer closed at 22:30.Overview: The hotel is an older building with a clean and tasteful d茅cor. One enters the hotel via a garden which is set up with tables. Breakfast can be eaten here 鈥?it was a 10 euro option we declined. The lobby has a computer with internet accesses, available for 4 euros for 30 minutes.Staff: The staff at check in was friendly and helpful. There is only 1 person working the small front desk. You interact with them a lot since you must leave your room key behind each time you leave the hotel.Rooms: Small by North American standards, yet reasonable. Furnished with the same tasteful look as the lobby. The room included a small TV with basic mulit-lingual channels (3 in English, BBC/CNN/SKY), there was a safe and a mini fridge. Air conditioning was centrally controlled, so you had no input into the room temperature. Noise: Hotel is older, and you can hear the other guests closing doors and any other loud noises. The street can be noisy with Police and garbage trucks. Bed: We found it reasonably comfortable, however it was a double so small by our standards.Bathroom: Clean, yet small. Only had a shower which has moderate water pressure and a steady stream of hot water.Overall, we would recommend this hotel. The location is fantastic, however the noise is a turn off.

<Content>Great Value with shortcomings We stayed 9 days/nights at this hotel in mid-May 2006. We read all the reviews before choosing the hotel, and found most all the reviews were very accurate, though I have a different take on some aspects of the hotel and neighborhood. The value is very good for such a clean hotel with new bathrooms, in a nice neighborhood. But our room (the cheapest rate room offered, with a shower not a tub) was TINY and we felt b/c we were staying and paying for 9 nights they could have given us a larger room for the money. It's difficult not even having a chest of drawers and having to literally live out of the suitcase for 9 days. I love the 7th arrondissment. It's so close to many sites, and it's clean and picturesque. Musee Rodin is a couple blocks away which all our friends urged us to see and which was wonderful having nearby b/c we got to see it twice, once in the day and once late at night after dinner. The real difference between the pricier hotels and this one is the staff, ultimately. Only very self-sufficient and people who already know Paris should stay here because the staff know almost nothing about restaurants to recommend, how and where to get a cab for dinner (though they will phone for an airport shuttle for you) or what stores sell what nearby. They are all friendly people, but do not provide true, proper concierge service. We actually had to walk to another more expensive hotel our first night, to get a recommendation from that concierge for dinner who more readily helped us even though we weren't guests there. Also note the nearby restaurants (many good ones, btw) close early and keep odd hours on odd days, so if you need to eat dinner late plan to eat in another neighborhood or to buy sandwiches you can carry back to the hotel. Otherwise you'll be left digging for stray lefotver airline peanuts in your purse like I was one night! But don't be scared off by my comments, it's a great hotel and a great value. Just keep these tips in mind, and splurge for the room with bath which is significantly larger than the room with shower. Bon Voyage!

<Content>Great value in Paris My wife and I just returned from Paris where we spent 8 nights in Room 26, a standard double which looked out over the courtyard. Rate 146E. I researched the Parisian hotels extensively prior to booking. Try to find a 3 star hotel at this rate in a fairly central location where the rooms and bathrooms are relatively large, well decorated and clean, and come with a small refrigerator (great for storing wine and picnic items), an in room safe, a flat screen TV with 3 english speaking channels, and a shower curtain. There was no alarm clock but you can program the phone to give you a wake up call. I'd bring an alarm clock for back up though. The room was very quiet with respect to outside noise. But the walls are apparently pretty thin. The phone in the adjacent room was easily heard in ours. That said, we rarely heard any voices. I think everyone must have spoken in quiet tones. The prior reviewers were dead on with respect to the location of the hotel. For those wanting to walk out of the hotel into a street of action, stay elsewhere. Such a street is a good 15 minute walk or so. Nevertheless, there are plenty of restaurants, a grocery store and everything else you'll need very close by. ATM is just down the street. The nearest metro is an easy 5 minute walk. Most of the top attactions are within a 15-30 minute walk.The staff was for the most part reserved but very helpful. This is not a BB type place where they fall over themselves to help you but I believe that's the norm for Paris. There are about 6 people who staff the front desk 24/7. Not all had restaurant recommendations. They give you a xerox copy of a map showing some French restaurants in the 7th but they don't seem prepared to make other recommendations, which is probably not unusual. So come prepared with your own list of places to eat. They will gladly make reservations, call cabs and do all that stuff. For you Mastercard holders, you might check with the hotel to confirm that they take it. We tried to pay for our stay with one and it was not accepted. The receptionist didn't know why but said it was a problem on her end which was clearly the case since I'd been using that card all week, had notified my MC company we'd be in Paris, had gobs of money left on the credit limit, and were able to use it immediately when we got home. So I'm not sure what the problem was. Fortunately we had a Visa card which did go through.We would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel Just got back from staying here last week, and miss it already heh. Really nice hotel - while it isn't cheap per se (many of the rooms approach or exceed $200), you get what you pay for and I think it was a good value for the quality. Impeccable rooms in nice matching Empire furnishings along with flat screen TV, DVD player, and free movies. The staff was reserved but helpful; a good match for the generally well-heeled clientele. Location is good. A nice number of cafes, patisseries, and small groceries right on the street, but of course it isn't the Latin Quarter either. Lots of small fancy businesses, embassies, etc. so basically lots of people in suits during the day. These stores all close at night too, but the area is very safe at night and you're just a 10 minute walk to the Rue Cler area. About 5-10 min walk to the Metro. The nearest Metro stop (Varenne) is not on a main line, so some switching will be necessary if you're planning on taking it to most other areas. The location is perfect is you're planning on concentrating in the Champs-Elysees, Invalides, Eiffel Tower, Rue Cler area, or if you've seen most of the high-volume tourist areas near the Notre Dame already.Basically the hotel was so nice it made us want to stay in it longer during the day, which for jet-lagged travelers could be a dangerous thing! (By contrast, our first (and much cheaper) hotel in the 6eme was so small you always felt compelled to leave) Highly recommended, for those who aren't set in staying in the more high-traffic areas.

<Content>Accurate reviews First of all, thanks to all who write reviews for this website. We found the reviews to be very accurate. This hotel definitely deserves its rank.My only trepidation in writing this review is that someday it will be too popular to get a reservation! After comparing its location with my other top choices, I'm glad we choose it. The laws of physics dictate that if it's a busy street and you're above it, noise travels up! at first glance the street did look very quiet, but as we got to know the area we found all we needed. Others have mentioned the various shops for food, etc..so I'll just mention the ATM at the end of the block (left out of the hotel) where you feel very safe. We ate at Le Basilac, one of the restaurants on the sheet that the front desk will give you for asking. It's very close and business was just picking up when we left at 9p.m.We loved the hotel! The staff is gracious, polite and willing to help. The rooms are clean and tastefully decorated and the bathrooms were great. My husband is a pretty good-sized guy and he felt very comfortable with the beds and the bath. The mini-fridge came in handy and we stocked up from the store across the street (and the patiserrie down the street)We ordered a taxi for the airport the day before with the front desk and it arrived right on time.The gentleman that placed the order was kind enough to ask about our luggage and realize we would need to reserve a larger taxi.Oh,just remember that if you order a taxi, the meter starts from their departure point, not your's!We're definitely going to stay here again.t

<Content>Perfect hotel-Totally DEAD location This hotel is perfect for anyone who wants nothing more than peace, quiet and luxury from a hotel in Paris. But, if you want a lively neighborhood, a feel for real Paris charm and life - you won鈥檛 want to stay here and for this one reason, I personally would never stay at this hotel again. I just wish I could move it to a more interesting neighborhood. The location is perfect for those who prefer a very quiet in a rather ritzy neighborhood in Paris. This hotel is in the area of governmental buildings and embassies, on a street which has one or two restaurants, and a few businesses, mostly high-end specialty shops and very few places of interest in general 鈥?and it was dead, day or night. The neighborhood seems very reserved and uppity. The plus side is that it makes it super safe, but at night, its like a nuclear bomb has hit after 9 pm. Nothing is open and everything is deadly quiet- you are lucky if you see another human in the vicinity of the hotel after 10 pm. God forbid you need a meal after 9 pm in this area.... This may have been due to the season (Late March-early April) but somehow I got the feeling this was typical of the street all year round. As I much prefer a lively neighborhood with businesses that stay open late, I鈥檇 choose to stay in another area, such as Rue Daguerre in Montparnasse 鈥搚ou get a truly feel for Paris 鈥?the local groceries stay open till 3 am and people sit around chatting and drinking in cafes until well after midnight鈥?its a nice break from the over-lively and touristy St. Germain areas and has a number of nice hotels. If I could move Varenne to such an area, it would be perfection in Paris.If you are the type who likes to retreat to a super quiet residential area at night, look no further. There is nothing more you can ask for in a hotel in Paris in this price range and there is a reason why this is #1 on tripadvisor in its price group. The hotel is super clean, with the best quality material used for every part of it 鈥?from the windows, which are new and double glass for quiet, to the plasma TVs, DVD players, luxury bathroom with great shower and water pressure 鈥?you won鈥檛 find better quality at some 4* places in Paris. Everything is super clean. Skip the breakfast and go to another neighborhood for breakfast (because you won鈥檛 get any options here other than the Patisserie next door, which is pricey) 鈥ut other than that, everything about the actual hotel is fantastic. All you have to do is be the type who likes it totally dead in the neighborhood you stay, and thinks of the hotel as a place of rest and nothing else.

<Content>A great little hotel We stayed there for three nights last week and thoroughly enjoyed it. We had a room in the eaves (but there is a lift all the way) It was a good size and the bathroom and separate WC were generous. A very large plasma TV and DVD player (with free DVDs from reception) were other noteworthy aspects of the facilities. The guy at reception gave us three excellent and quite different restaurants for dinner each night and also made the bookings.The one criticism was that there were not enough staff on for breakfast and on two days we had to wait for tables to be cleared of the debris from earlier diners. The breakfast itself was at the good end of the typical continental breakfast spectrum.

<Content>A Good Hotel We stayed at the Hotel de Varenne mid-March for 7 nights. We did a lot of research on Paris hotels prior to our trip and found that the Varenne is an excellent value compared to other hotels in Paris. The hotel is on a quiet street, but very centrally located to many sites in the city. My one complaint with the location is the lack of restaurants in the immediate area, after a long day of walking around the city it would have been nice to have some options close to the hotel. There is an excellent bakery next door, a grocery across the street, and two bank machines at the rue de Grenelle and Bourgogne. The area is very safe and we felt very comfortable walking around late at night. The hotel: the lobby is very small, with a small dining area to the right as you enter. We never ate breakfast at the hotel, but was usually busy when we were leaving in the morning. A very small elevator was tucked away at the other side. The lobby was very small but quaint. We stayed in two different rooms during the week. The first was priced at 120 euros and was located on the second floor. It was located at the end of the hallway, which I thought would be great for noise, but the walls were extremely thin. We heard every noise made in the room next to us, below us and above us, usually sound doesn't bother me, but it was pretty bad...some nights we had a hard time sleeping because of the thin walls. The room was clean and small. One day they installed shelves in our bathroom, without our notification, after which the room smelt of varnish for the remainder of the stay. The second room we stayed in was much better, it was 140 euro on the same floor, but was much bigger, and had two large windows overlooking the garden, we wish we had stayed in this room all week. If you like extra features in your hotel: gyms, spas etc than this isn't the hotel for you. If you are self-sufficient and don't require a lot of attention, than this hotel could be for you. It is good value for the money in a very very expensive city.Based on recommendations on this site, we took a taxi to the hotel upon arrival at CDG, it cost approx. 45 euros on a quiet Sunday morning with two suitcases. We took the RER on the return trip to the airport and was glad we didn't attempt it on our arrival, but is a good option when you get familiar with the metro system. It cost 16 euros and took approx. 1 hour.Thanks again to trip advisor for helping us select another great hotel.

<Content>Strongly Recommend Absolutely best bang for the buck. Perfect location, away from the crowds, in a residential neighborhood, but close to St. Germain, the Orsay, Louvre and Picasso. Extremely friendly helpful staff, assisted us on numerous occasions with reservations and other matters. Mixed groups of guests, many French, some Europeans. Really feels like a bed and breakfast with all the advantages of a hotel. Clean,spacious rooms and bathrooms, with new furniture and fixtures.

<Content>Solid 3 star hotel We stayed 5 days in March. Room was a good size. Having a fridge in the room was great for keeping drinks.Internet connectivity is great - but the 3 hr card if you have your own laptop!The location is has close access to the Metro and grocery and food shops.I agree with other reviewers that you should arrive at the hotel via shuttle or taxi.

<Content>Nice overall impression Stayed at the Hotel de Varenne for 6 nights (March 5-11) with my wife and another couple. I liked the place quite a bit: GREAT location (close enough to things in general, but far enough away from hustle, bustle, and noise). Very good bakery 2 doors down, 2 grocery/convenience stores across the street - one operated by an extremely friendly guy who gave my wife a jar of nutella when she informed him that we were returning to the states the next day; a bnp paribas bank and atm on the same block (great for bank of america account holders - no atm transaction fees!).The only convenience we really lacked in the hotel was drawer space. Our room (#34, a double with a shower) didn't have any. Our friends stayed in room #44, which did. No complaints at all about the cleanliness, however.Madame Beatrix (who worked the front desk a lot) was really helpful, nice and friendly.All in all, we would stay there again, no question. You won't be disappointed if you go in expecting a good hotel and a good value. You will be disappointed if you go in expecting perfection.

<Content>Somewhat Mixed Feelings We just returned from a three night stay at the Hotel de Varenne. We stayed there based on reviews on Trip Advisor. We found the hotel to be nice for a three star hotel. The location is a bit off the beaten path, but we knew that from other reviewers. We found it odd that they allocated just one tiny box of tissues with four tissues inside, for two people for a three day stay???? Some of the staff were very nice, some icily helpful. The hotel was clean, but not spotless. There is no help with bags and the elevator is very tiny, which makes it difficult to transport your own luggage if you have more than a bag per person. We have stayed in many hotels in Paris and overall this is not a bad choice. We didn't leave the hotel with a great feeling, but we wouldn't tell other people not to stay there.

<Content>Best Stay for the Money We stayed at the Varenne for a week at the end of January, having relied on reviews in Tripadvisor. As usual, this site did not let us down.We (2 of us) stayed in a superior room, which was more than ample. We happened to see inside a standard room while walking out, and that room size is above and beyond in size from what you find in Paris at a 3-star hotel.Our room was very clean, but do not expect the George V. Having the fridge in the room was a big plus. Staff is quiet but very helpful. Internet station (for a small fee based on 1 hour or 1/2 hour) also was convenient.The location is excellent as to having close access to the Metro and grocery and food shops. However, if you are carrying a lot of luggage, I do NOT recommend arriving at the hotel using anything other than a shuttle or taxi. The RER stations are a long walk if the weather is cold and some of the streets are narrow. Plus, the Varenne Metro stop is not great for transporting a large suitcase. What you spend in additional money is worth the convenience. Otherwise, if you are travelling light, the Metro or RER is fine. If you absolutely have to use the RER, use a station on the RER-B as your entry/exit point and taxi to/from the hotel.

<Content>Loved this place Just had a lovely stay at Hotel Varenne in Paris- a perfect little Parisian Hotel I would DEFINITELY return to. Around the block from the Metro station 'Varenne' it is located in a very central, (right up the street from Musee Rodin) but quiet location with police and cameras everywhere as it is close to Embassy's. We felt safe getting off the Metro at anytime.After a long day in Paris, no worries, located right outside the hotel is everything you need and you won't have to walk far for an excellent meal no matter what your budget.From Orly to Hotel Varenne by Taxi: 22 EurosFrom Hotel Varenne to Orly Aiport: 40 EurosWith two people and luggage, this seemed like a bargain. You can take the Metro and transfer to a bus but in the end, the cost is probably equal to taking a taxi but without the headache.To get to Hotel Varenne from Charles de Gaulle:Take the RER 'Blue' Train and get off at St. Michel. Walk over to the RER 'Yellow' Train and go towards Versaille. A few stations down, exit at Invalides or transfer to the Metro 'light blue' light and get off at the next stop Varenne. Walk to Hotel Varenne from either the Varenne or Invalide Metro stop. (consult your own map- the hotel is very easy to find from the Invalide station).FYI- my most important advice....if you're flying out of Charles de Gaulle, before you get to the airport know which terminal you are flying out of (call the airline or go online!!) and give yourself PLENTY of time- 3-4 hours for international flights- I'm not kidding!! Good luck (especially if you're flying Air France or any of their partner airlines!!).Have fun (and skip Angelina's 'Famous' Hot Chocolate. Very, very sweet and thick. If you absolutely must try it, get one and share!)

<Content>Perfect !! We found this lovely hotel through the tripadvisor, and can only agree with all the good reviews of this lovely little hotel. The location is perfect, an easy walk to the Louvre, the Champs Elysees etc. Equally important is the fact that we felt perfectly safe in the neighborhood : it is close to their National Assembly and there are a number of foreign embassies in neighboring streets, so there are always policemen around. The hotel itself has a nice atmosphere that shows personal care of the management, the room was nice and the bathroom both large and clean. I would certainly want to stay there again!!

<Content>Location! Location! Location! We stayed at the Hotel Varenne for seven nights in February. We adored the location, clean quiet rooms, the friendly staff and the smell of the fresh bread early in the morning. This Hotel is one of the best examples of Quality Customer Service that we have experienced. Our hats are off to all of the staff at the Hotel Varenne.

<Content>Great Little Jewel of a Hotel I just took a business trip to Paris. I want to recommend Hotel Varenne as one of the classiest 3-star spots I know of. The room I was shown in was very clean, and smelled good. It was pleasantly warm (they have A/C and wall heaters), rather large, with plenty of space to accommodate a large suitcase. Nice, clean carpet, no dust on the furniture (Napoleon-style, I liked it). Overall it felt rich. The bathroom was spotless with marble-like amber-colored wall tiling, sparkling clean shower, a sink with a nice Corian top, heating rails for towels. The queen-sized bedding was firm but not too much, with a Treka springbox and mattress. Windows had double glazing, but even when I had them open (briefly, it's cold out there in January), I found traffic noise to be minimal: Bourgogne Street is a quiet one, and the room overlooks a fairly long courtyard. Wireless internet access is a pay-for system, but it's rather inexpensive. The hotel itself was well maintained and nicely decorated with wrought-iron handrails, and fine 19th-century prints. The owner, Mr. Pommier, is a mild-mannered gentleman in his early fifties. Always friendly, he was keen to help. The reception staff was also polite and helpful. I rate the hotel service as impeccable. On Mr. Pommier's recommendation, I had lunch nearby at a classy French restaurant named Chez Tante Marguerite. Truly delightful. The neighborhood is clean, quiet, and safe. The nearby Varenne Street is home to the French Prime Minister, the French Parliament, and several embassies: you can't walk 200 yards without seeing a cop. The St Germain des Pres district lies about 20 minutes away on foot. Overall, my experience with Hotel Varenne was very satisfying. Other TripAdvisor members also rate it highly, and I completely agree with them.

<Content>Varenne: Family Hospitality The Hotel de Varenne is a bargain. It is located between the Invalides and the Place de Bourbon, and just a half block from the Rodin Museum. During the day, at least one family member is present and unfailingly helpful and courteous. The night staff were always multi-lingual and very competant and eager to please. The rooms were clean and effcient. Baths were refurbished. All public and private spaces were done in excellent taste. Breakfast was good, with fresh baguettes from a local baker. If you want a full breakfast, there are optional items at a modest cost. Each time I visit Paris, I try to stay in a different neighborhood. This time I chose the right bank near the Hotel des Invalides, where you can see the tomb of Napolean, part of the military museum complex. In the opposite direction you can take a rigorous 10 minute walk to the Musee' d'Orsay and the St. Germain neighborhood, with its art galleries and elegant shops. Five minutes from the hotel you are standing on the esplanade above the Seine River.In the hotel, internet service is free if you have your own computer. The building is hot. Otherwise, be prepared to pay six Euros an hour to buy a card and use their one station. There are no internet cafes in the area, so the options are nil; this was my only complaint.This hotel is among the Top 10 among TripAdvisor Paris hotels, and the lowest priced of that group. Thanks to TripAdvisor for the tip and this lucky find.

<Content>Nice and Quiet We stayed at Hotel de Varenne over the Thanksgiving holiday. It was quiet, clean, nicely if modestly decorated, and comfortable for a hotel in this price range. Staff was pleasant, if not particularly forthcoming.The immediate area is not booming with restaurants or bars, and we found almost everything closed early (or not open at all on Sunday). Fortunately, it's a short walk to the bustling area surrounding Le Bon Marche.Metro access about 1-1/2 blocks. Note: we took several taxis, and I ended up giving all of them directions to this relatively small street. Know your adjoining streets!All in all pleasant, but if being near the Tour Eiffel is a priority for you I suggest looking in the Rue St. Dominique area (also foodie heaven!).

<Content>Homey, Friendly Staff, and Great Location We booked the Hotel de Varenne for 9 nights over the Christmas holiday based on Tripadvisor reviews, and we were not disappointed. Those of you who prefer to pay $300-$500 per night for a large chain with spa etc, may not find the homey atmosphere and quiet location your thing, but we loved it. The area is very safe and quiet, but right in the middle of all the fun areas you'll want to go. We took the RER from the airport and transferred to the C-line, so it couldn't have been easier to get to the hotel from the Invalides metro stop. As others have mentioned, there are great bakeries, produce stands, and markets on the street to grab anything you need to stock your hotel fridge. We enjoyed breakfast at the hotel (the traditional French nosh of baked goods and coffee), but anyone who is looking for a big American breakfast will need to get used to the grocery store. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and polite. The hotel owner, Jean Marc Pommier, went so far as to bake us bread one night when all the bakeries on our street were closed over the Christmas holiday! We were a little intimidated because we didn't speak much French, but as long as you practice some general niceties and try a little French, the locals are wonderful. Just note that they work a 35 hour wk, but when they work, they are extremely busy. They like to be efficient and understandably will get irritated if you dawdle and hold up service for other customers (see complaint in earlier review).As for the room, we had a nice size bedroom and bathroom by Europen standards. The beds leave you a little stiff in the morning, but are probably about the best we've had in our visits to Europe. Comments about cleanliness are correct, as this is one of the cleanest places around and recently renovated. (Just keep in mind to dodge the doggie droppings while out walking though.) The rooms are fairly quiet inside, and we had a view of the top of the Eiffel tower and the courtyard which was nice. We have definitely been recommending the Hotel de Varenne to friends and family and hope to come back soon!

<Content>Charming and Quiet My wife and I wanted a small, non-corporate hotel that was quiet, clean, friendly, and located in a safe and convenient area. Hotel De Varenne exceeded our expectations. It is only half a block from the Rodin Museum and only a few doors down from fine breads, pastries, and a small grocery. Jean-Marc Pommier's personal welcome when we arrived was appreciated and his staff were friendly and helpful. The room itself was outstanding. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip and will recommend Hotel de Varenne to our friends.

<Content>Great location, not so good beds My daughter and I spent 5 days from the last days of October to beginnings of November.We couldn麓t find a better location: very quite and charming neighborhood, a few steps from Mus茅e Rodin, a metro in the same block, supermarkets, boulangerie, laundry and even a ATM very close to the hotel. We felt very safe, even at night.The superior room we had was huge, as well as the bathroom. There was a video player, so we could see the CD with our photos and even listen music.The lighting was somewhat poor.I booked the hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and in the hotel web site. The fact that was decisive was the one about the bedding. We were disappointed because instead of being first quality the mattresses were too soft. They need to be changed. The WC was separated by a door, a very practical detail.The bath lighting was good, except for the dark tub. Furthermore, the curtain stucked against my body and that made the shower time quite unpleasant.The front staff, especially Madame Beatrix, was very efficient. In fact, she solved a problem I had with the shuttle reservation some weeks before my arrival. We had breakfast the first day but it had too calories and few variety. It wasn麓t worth the price.There is a fridge in the room so we bought supplies in front of the hotel. That was a great plus.I would return... but with refurbished beds!

<Content>Worth considering, especially if you're on a budget! This hotel is conveniently located about three minutes from Varenne Metro station. It鈥檚 a five minute walk from the Assembl茅e Nationale, and about 15 minutes from the Eiffel tower. Due to the presence of several embassies and diplomatic missions on surrounding streets and the proximity of the parliament, there is a very high visibility police presence, and the area is therefore probably relatively safe to walk in at night.We stayed here in November 2005, in a standard double room on the first floor. Despite being on a moderately busy street, there was no audible traffic noise at night. The room was small, but adequate, and well heated. The bathroom was also small but spotlessly clean. The bath had a 鈥榯elephone set鈥?shower attachment, but there was no wall fitting on which to attach the shower, so I had to hold it while showering.The double bed was small, and sagged slightly in the middle, making it an adventure to get a good night鈥檚 sleep 鈥?neither of us had an unbroken night鈥檚 sleep.The reception was small, but the staff were polite and helpful.A bakery (with incredibly rude staff who scream at you if you don鈥檛 respond immediately when they come to serve you!!) almost beside the hotel sells a good selection of fresh bread and pastries, and there was almost always a queue outside 鈥?if you are into croissants and Danish pastries to take away, this will make your day! I鈥檇 overlook the staff in favour of the produce.By Paris standards, the hotel was cheap, and despite the shortcomings listed above, I鈥檇 consider staying there again as it was good value.

<Content>First Class Hotel in a Quiet Neighborhood My wife and I spent 4 nights at the de Varenne in the end of September. It was a great hotel!The rooms were spotless. The bathrooms were large and even more spotless.Everyone at the reception desk was most helpful and answered all of our questions, even via E-Mail before we got there.It is in a quite neighborhood with some great bakeries and markets on the same street. It is a five minute walk to the Metro. The metro is the best way to travel. It is clean and runs every few minutes.We did a lot of research on trip advisor on finding a hotel, and it paid off!We had breakfast at the hotel twice. The assortment of rolls was nice.We even had a view of the top of the Eiffel Tower. It was most impressive.Only drawback is the location at night. If you want to walk to a nice restaurant, it is a long walk, There are only a few restaurantscloseby. If you are looking for a great hotel in a quiet and safe neighborhood....look no more!Do yourslef a favor, don't bring Cash. Use your ATM's to get Euros. Bring some nice walking shoes too. You will walk a lot.

<Content>A Delightful Small Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Hotel de Varenne for five nights. We were extremely pleased with the location as well as the quality of the hotel. We opted for one of the larger (more expensive) rooms and felt that it was worth the extra charge. There was a small refrigerator in the room and we purchased breakfast finger foods, drinks, and fruit at the markets near the hotel. When we return to Paris we plan on staying at the Hotel de Varenne.Soulton and Beatrice, both front desk employees, were so helpful and pleasant. They added to the pleasure of our visit in Paris.

<Content>Nice Clean Hotel in a Good Location I spent 4 nights at the Varenne with my wife and 11 year old son. The room was large enough for an extra twin bed, so it fit our needs nicely. The interior decor is very nice and the bathrooms are large and marble lined. The front desk is a little icy, and one of the gentlemen on the night desk was down right rude at times. But Soultan, the Indian gentleman at night, was very friendly.There are two mini-marts and a patisserie within a few doors of the hotel. I don't recommend paying 10 Euros for a breakfast of croissants and coffee. There are some decent cafes on Rue de Grenelle for lunch or a light dinner. Go to Maubourg or St. Germaine area for a wider assortment of restaurants that stay open later.

<Content>Great find in a lovely area We just stayed 2 nights at the Varenne, having found it via Tripadvisor.I booked a room with a shower, but was pleasantly surprised to have been upgraded on check in.The hotel is perfectly located for the Rodin, Musee D'Orsay and all the central attractions. It's a smart, diplomatic area.Try the walk from the hotel across the 6th and 7th districts to St Germain, great shopping and bistros everywhere. The only thing I did notice in general was that if you didn't speak good French, the locals don't seem to help a great deal and find it amusing, but I guess that's a good old English vs. French type thing, after all they have a lot to be proud of.We also found the best bisto ever next to Notre Dame - on the North side (next to a postcard shop), around 50 metres past the front entrance of the cathedral. Best food I've ever eaten.

<Content>Generally Good Hotel We spent 4 nights at the Hotel Varenne. Our rooms were smallish but well furnished and clean. The location is great, on a fairly quiet street and a 2 block walk to the Varenne metro station. Although the hotel advertises it is air conditioned, we found that the system had been turned off for the winter. It was unseasonably warm so we had to open the windows and endure the noise. Getting around is easy if you use the metro or walk. Getting a cab is harder--there are no cab stands nearby and few cabs frequent the area. If the hotel calls a cab, the meter starts when the cab leaves the stand--expect a 5-9 euro add on to the fare because of that. I would also echo the comment made in an earlier review--there is a potential fire safety issue with only one central open staircase and no fire doors. If the staircase was blocked there is no other exit from the top floors.

<Content>Great Value The hotel was relatively well located close to a few attractions and a relatively easy walk (20 minutes) to the Eiffle Tower. We picked up a bus tour close to the hotel and that was a great way to get a basic overview of the city. The hotel staff was not the friendliest, but oh well. I wasn't there to see them. My room was a little small, but my parents and my brother and sister all had good sized rooms...I even paid more than they did for an upgraded room??? The breakfast was good...try the chocolate crossants!! There was a cute little courtyard where my family and my boyfriend and I all enjoyed wine and cheese and pate. It was a lot of fun. We were there in August, so a lot of the restaurants close by that we wanted to try were closed, but there were a couple ok ones and there was a market across the street to buy snacks if you weren't satisfied with dinner. Overall a great value for what you get.

<Content>Loved the Varenne Just got back from a long weekend at the Varenne and just had to say we loved the place. Stayed with my wife and two kids in two seperate rooms. The area is quiet and full of embassies which actually made you feel really secure. Well positioned with the use of three different metro stations within 300 meters. The hotel and staff were terrific, and we will definitely stop again when in Paris.

<Content>Great Value in Paris I used TripAdvisor to find this hotel and we were not disappointed. Location is excellent for playing tourist. Good restaurants, pastisseries and boulangeries etc nearby. Rooms are somewhat small although the most expensive ones are a bit larger. They are well furnished and the bathrooms are fine. The larger rooms were all booked during our visit from Oct 1-7. Staff for the most part were very helpful. Although one gentleman seemed to be annoyed at the most basic request/question. He was at the desk much too often given his attitude. Wonderful croissants for breakfast (if not underbaked). We will definitely stay at Hotel de Varenne on our next visit to Paris--this was our ninth.

<Content>Nice hotel, very safe location, close to everything This hotel is close to everything -- public transport, The Rodin Museum, the Eiffel Tower. I will quote another reivew here ans say that It is also close to the little things a traveler might need -- pharmacy, cash machine and terrific little bread and pastry shops. The street is quiet and makes for a nice respite in the middle of a big city.The garden/court area is beautiful and quite. The front desk/dining area is tiny but adequate. We spoke almost no French, but in our minimal intercations with staff they spoke excellent English. They were even able to provice us with great maps of the city and subway system. Our room was excellent, it was well furnished (including a nice flat panel TV that we barely watched). We had a top floor room with a view of the Eiffel tower, it was just perfect. As with many other European restrooms we were a bit put off by the lack of shower curtain or door, but we got used to it quickly. The rest of the bathroom amenities were fine. Overall we have a very good stay at the Varenne. It was very safe due to its embassy location and easy to find. One note that I will make, and I found this at all our stops in large cities in Europe, parking is expensive and inconvenient. If I do it again, I will not drive into Paris but instead take a train.

<Content>Lovely stay This is a small Left Bank hotel that feels more like a large bed and breakfast. Our window actually opened, and it looked out on the pleasant courtyard at the off-street hotel entrance. The hotel is walking distance from the Seine, the Place de la Concorde, Boulevard St. Germain, Rodin Museum and Orsay Museum. Metro stops are omnipresent and get you anywhere quickly and cheaply. Our room was comparatively spacious (rooms are smaller in Europe than the USA) and very quiet. I have never, anywhere, been in a better-maintained hotel. The rooms, indeed the entire premise, are spotless and bright. They must scour the bathroom tile grout with toothbrushes. I am sure this is the only place in the world where one sees the hotel manager himself on a ladder cleaning and polishing the outside lighting fixtures. The staff was quite pleasant, save a glitch with a night clerk over purchase of Internet time.Breakfast (only) consisting of croissants, danish and coffee is available in the small dining area or your room for 10E, more for cooked items. But, there is better in the area. There is nothing, but nothing on earth, so wonderful as fresh-baked French bread and pastry in Paris. In our week at the Varenne, we usually ate breakfast from the Patisserie Besneir a few doors away. Unbelievable. We often prepared a takeaway picnic lunch or dinner from the same place, getting some fresh fruit, cheese and drinks from the Proxi mini market across the street. There are many small restaurants in the immediate area and sidewalk caf茅 upon sidewalk caf茅 are within walking distance.Our only actual bad experience in Paris was getting a purse pick-pocketed at the Orsay Museum. While we had heard that this kind of crime is common there, it is much worse than we had anticipated and the French police seem to do little about it. Pickpockets swarm in public places, especially among tourists. There are also petty thieves on one pretty quickly when attempting the Metro ticket machines or staring at a street map. This is an issue about which to be concerned when considering a Paris visit.The Hotel de Varenne is a lovely, unpretentious, beautifully maintained little hotel with reasonable rates. If you prefer the full-service George V sort of thing, go to the Right Bank and spend five or six times more. We enjoyed our stay at the Varenne and would happily stay again.

<Content>A wonderful hotel, perfect location but ... A wonderful hotel in a perfect location but let down only a little by the staff. Don't get me wrong the staff were nice enough but the service at breakfast was terrible. After several requests and 30 minutes later in only a half full breakfast room we eventually tucked in to a nice breakfast. A quicker service would easily have added the extra etoile

<Content>Excellent boutique hotel Hotel Varenne was our 1st experience in Paris. Very happy with room size and extreme cleanliness. Staff was very pleasant and efficient. We did not try breakfast @ hotel. Generously sized shampoo and soap amenities, PLUS washcoths! Most importantly--area is EXTREMELY safe! Located near international embassies. Evening walks from the hotel to metro and/or latin quarter are a delight and 24-hour ATM withdrawals by tourists are not intimidating.Many prior hotel guests refer to the Varenne metro station. We preferred to walk to the Invalides metro instead. Invalides is equally close, but it provides more selection of metro lines. We found Paris's metro to be EXCELLENT--clean, safe, and efficient. Absolutely no need to use rental car or taxis! Strongly suggest buying the orange pass. Valid for 1 week  includes unlimited metro/bus travel...a terrific investment even if used only 4 days.We highly recommend the Hotel Varenne and will certainly stay there again!

<Content>A Nice Little Hotel The first thing we noticed about the de Varenne is its location. Everything is close by -- Les Invalides, The Rodin Museum, the Eiffel Tower. It is also close to the little things a traveler might need -- pharmacy, cash machine and terrific little bread and pastry shops. The street is quiet and makes for a nice respite in the middle of a big city.You enter the de Varenne through a cute little courtyard garden. The indoor public spaces are minimal. There is a tiny lobby and a nice little breakfast room with about 8 tables. Our welcome was warm, but not exceptional. We spoke mostly French, but the staff were quite competent in English. The breakfast was a bit too American style for our tastes, but served by a lovely woman who catered to every whim.The rooms at the de Varenne are nice. They are small but well-furnished with nice creature comforts like flat-screen TVs. Ours (#18) looked out over the back of the entry courtyard for a fantastic view. Double-paned windows kept everything nice and quiet. Our bathroom was a bit plain, but fitted with top-of-the line taps. Everything was comfortable and clean.Overall, the Hotel de Varenne is a nice place to stay. It blends location and good amenities with decent (but not exceptional) service. We would -- and probably will -- stay there again.

<Content>A perfect small hotel I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I traveled to Paris with my parents and my partner, and my father came down with a bad flu not long after we arrived. The Varenne staff was outstanding, helping us get in touch with a doctor (doctors in Paris make house calls, and come with an hour!), and taking care of all of our extra needs (finding a pharmacist, etc.). The hotel is completely cozy, and everything is spotless. Rooms and bathrooms are just the right size. Beds are very comfortable. Nice flat-screen tvs. The breakfast was delicious (although all of those carbs so early in the morning can make for sleepy sightseeing). I couldn't imagine staying at a better place in this price range.The location is quite pleasant, although somewhat of a walk to more entertaining areas. Also, it's just about impossible to find a restaurant (or anything) open on Sunday, and next to impossible to find a restaurant open on a Saturday night. I would advise against using taxis if you can help it -- we found that the drivers took many indirect routes and added on all sorts of hidden fees.

<Content>Very Pleasant My wife and I stayed 3 nights at Hotel de Varenne in mid September and were very pleased.Friendly staff, convenient location, clean bedroom and bathroom and comfortable bed. We stayed in a superior double for 150 Euro per night.It is located in a quiet area, 10min walk from Varenne metro (Paris metro is very good for quick transport around town), and short walks to Rodin and Orsay museums and Rue Cler. Plenty of patisseries, grocery stores and restaurants in the area. 30min walk to the Eiffel Tower (or you can catch the metro). Also close to the Open-Top bus stop at Invalides.Would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>great night's sleep We stayed here as a stopover from visiting southern France and flying home from Paris so we were there only one night. But it met all our needs. Comfortable, quiet, clean, albeit our room was a bit small. We found enough stores nearby to buy fruit, bread, etc. but there's not much else going on in this neighborhood. And the Varenne metro stop is nearby.So was perfect for what we needed. If we were staying put in Paris for a while I'd still considerate it though other neighborhoods would probably be more tempting.

<Content>Nice place to stay My wife and I spent 5 nights at this clean and quiet hotel. The staff is pleasant and the location is excellent. Short walk to the Metro, 2 small grocery stores, a produce stand, pastry shop and pharmacy all with 50 meters of the hotel. We had a room with view of courtyard on one side and street on the other and it was extremely quiet.

<Content>very pleasant stay! My husband and I tayed im Hotel de Varenne last week and it was just wonderful. On our arrival, there was no delay in getting into our room. We had a very nice large bedded room, we were told that all rooms have been recently renovated . Well done, the atmosphere is very cozy and the bed was extremely comfortable and everything was so immaculately clean. It is so quiet during the night, you cannot imagine such a quiet locaton in the centre of Paris. The bathroom looked as if it hat just been redone too. The most wonderfull ist this very charming and peacefull garden. We feld so sorry that it was too cold in the morning to take our breakfast outside, but in the afternoon it was very nice and we sat down to read and drink some coffee.We celebrated our 25. wedding anniversary. For this occassion I asked the hotel to arrange a bottle of champagne in our room. We found the staff extremely friendly and helpful, everybody speaks several languages.The location was great. We walked to most major attractions. There was not much nightlife right around the hotel, but instead it was very safe to walk arround, even during the evening. The street Bourgogne ist charming.The WIFI connection in the room was a real big plus for my husband who cannot disconnect from his business, Schade! The only problem I experienced was the delay of getting a taxi in the morning to take us to the train station. But this was due to the exhibitions in Paris.We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and we will return again, maybe next easter.

<Content>Not all we hoped for The Varenne was indeed clean, lovely and in a good location. However our room (a standard double for 120 euros a night) was small even by Paris standards and the bed was sub-standard. There was no hot water one morning and the breakfast was poor. After 8 trips to Paris I didn't think you could find a bad croissant, but the croissant and baguette I was served seemed as if they had been reheated after being frozen. And there are two excellent bakeries within a block! On the plus side, the air conditioning was quiet and effective, which can make a tremendous difference in the summer. The staff were polite and helpful. However, there are better deals to be had in Paris and we will probably not return.

<Content>Security problems Hotel de Varenne it's definitely a cosy hotel, in a nice neighbourhood with good accommodation, but one item is lacking (a very important one, see the tragic incidents in Paris, recently): FIRE SECURITY pure and simply doesn't exist.I stayed in the upper floors (4th) and didn't see any fire prevention or emergency exits. The only stairs are extremely narrow. Believe me, I'm not a security freak or something like that, but the recent events in Paris show us that this is not a luxury. If this problem is solved, I'll agree completely in the previous reviews.

<Content>Good Value For the price and location this is a great hotel. The bathroom was clean and the toliet was in a room separate from the sink and shower. The bed was average-- a little soft- but certaily expectable for a few nights. The flat screen TV in the room had lots of chanels. The hotel staff was very friendly and are able to provide you with hot or cold beverages (for a reasonable fee) at any time of day. Very close to the Varenne metro and walking distance to many other attractions.

<Content>My "I Love Paris" Hotel My husband  I, who are in our 50s just returned to the US from a vacation to France  the UK.The highlight of our trip was our 6 days at the Varenne. What a perfect little Paris hotel! We loved the quiet, out of the way location. First you pass through a garden courtyard  enter the dignified lobby. The staff is helpful  speaks excellent English. It's only 2 blocks from the Metro  there are a grocery, bakery  restaurants plus museums close by.We had a very clean superior twin room, decorated in Neo-classical style which was as large as most US hotel rooms. The Varenne was recently renovated. The plumbing, tile  decoration are brand new  the rooms have a fridge, safe, cable TV  AC. The towels are nice  fluffy. We got a special summer rate with breakfast, so every morning we enjoyed hot chocolate  warm chocolate croissants in the courtyard--heavenly!The only negatives were the tiny elevator  the scaffold outside our window (but the workmen only worked weekdays, so weekends were quiet. Hopefully when you stay at the Varenne the scaffold will be gone.) Also our telephone didn't work very well.This is a great hotel for honeymooneers  romantics. Also, for women traveling alone, since the neighborhood feels very safe. The only improvement I can suggest would be a little vase of fresh flowers in my room  chocolates on the pillow--or is that too much of a cliche?

<Content>Customer Friendly We had a lovely stay at the Hotel. Staff were helpful but unobtrusive. The Hotel is very plesant, rooms are a good size and very well kept. The summer offers were excellent value and being able to have breakfast in the Courtyard was a real bonus. Ideal location for all the major sites. We will return and have recommended the Hotel to all our friends

<Content>Charming! INSIDE: Just renovated. Clean everywhere (bath room, carpet etc), nice interior, new towels, TV provided NHK, CNN, BBC and others. Suite and non-suite rooms are not too much difference (we stayed both). The rooms with windows facing the hotel's garden are better than the ones facing the street. Both types had safe, refrig., hair dryer, shampoo  shower gel. We did not use internet because they charge 6 euro per hour (or first hour, I don't remember). I wish they had bigger pillows (it maybe an American thing to have big and/or many pillows).OUTSIDE: Nice and quiet surrounded by govermental offices, super charming corridor and garding with table and chairs (we had wine, cheese and bread and sat there for 3 hours to enjoy conversation. hotel provided glasses, bottle opener, napkins!). SERVICE: Everybody spoke English except maids. Very friendly. Quick responses via e-mails. Nice breadfast comes with orange juice, croissant, chololate croissant, baguette, jam, butter, coffee (non-expresso) or hot cholocate. LOCATION: Hotel is at Metro M13 Varenne station. If you are coming from the CDG using Metro/RER, you will take RER B (30 min), switch at St. Michell to RER C, get off at Invalides and walk to the hotel or switch to Metro 13 to go to Varenne. Note Metro stations do not have escalators or elevators. To and from Varenne station, you can view Eiffel tower (beautiful at night!)PRICE: Go to the home page to find out any promotion. We paid 129 euro for suite and 119 for non-suite.I definately recommend Varenne if you want to stay in clean, quiet, nice but not intimidating place.

<Content>Magnificient! You all should stay here! Thank you trip advisor for the excellent reviews regarding this hotel!We (my husband and son) stayed here for 6 nights in July and have absolutely nothing to complain about, just praises and thanks to the staff who made our stay memorable. After hours and hours of walking our hotel made us relax and feel the essence of being on holiday. Loved the ambience and the garden where we had breakfast a couple of times. Special mention to one of the hotel receptionists, Farouk who was ever so helpful and always met us with his warm smile after being out the whole day. Absolutely maginificient and really, you all should stay here!

<Content>An absolutely outstanding hotel in Paris This is, without a doubt, the best Paris hotel I have ever stayed in, and certainly one of the best small hotels I've stayed in anywhere. The rooms are spacious, immaculately clean and have loads of light. The breakfast served downstairs each morning is fantastic - fresh croissants and baguette and wonderful cafe au lait. The location is perfect: within walking distance of the Champs Elysees and the Eiffel Tower, in Les Invalides.But it is the staff that deserves special mention. Everyone is courteous and helpful - indeed, they really do go the extra mile to be helpful -- to the point that they mailed two t-shirts that I had forgotten in our room to me. Even little things like checking when the local post office opens or locating a local laundry for me - it has been a long time since I received such excellent service in a hotel.I will not hesitate to return to the Hotel de Varenne the next time I am in Paris and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a wonderful small hotel that is centrally located.

<Content>Good value - good choice In its range it is a very good hotel. The rooms are clean and modern, service is good and the location is fine. Breakfast is very pleasant in the courtyard and the price (Euro 119) was unbeatable.

<Content>Great value, clean and quiet Most of what I have to say has been said before in the numerous reviews. The location is good, but not exactly ideal. You can walk to 3 museums: d'Orsay, Rodin, and les Invalides, which is nice, but the closest metro station isn't a major one so you'll have to transfer a lot. Its on a quiet street and the rooms are very clean and well maintained. The bathroom is big by European standards, but like many French hotels, there is no shower curtain or door so you have to be careful not to soak the bathroom when bathing. Breakfast in the courtyard was very relaxing and good, but don't expect an American breakfast. Its just a basket of really good breads and jams, OJ, and coffee, tea or hot chocolate. I didn't find the staff overly friendly, but they definitely were not rude or anything. They have WiFi in the rooms, but you have to buy a fairly expensive access card. Even the lobby PC has a fee to use the internet. There's a good bakery a few doors down and a small grocery store across the street. Several restaurants are within a 5-10 min. walk.

<Content>It's all true I want to thank all of those who have left reviews of this hotel before me, great recommendations and I would recommend this place to anyone. Great value, good sized rooms, nice flat-screen TV with good range of European / UK channels, air conditioning that worked well in a mini-heat wave, and the staff are friendly and speak good English. Location is peaceful but very central, only a few minutes walk from the metro or the RER. The safe worked (I find sometimes they don't, or they are temperamental so I dont trust them in case all my thing get locked and I can't get them). Lots of nice touches that you don't always get in this class of hotel: eg about a dozen good quality removeable wooden coat hangers in a wardrobe (I hate those hangers that you can't remove from the rail and are impossible to use sometimes). A couple of minor points.....a bit stingey with towels (1 small bath towel, 1 hand towel and 1 floor towel), maybe it's because I was staying in the room alone I only got this number, but an extra towel would have been appreciated. Had it been an issue I'd have asked for an extra towel, the staff are very approachable so don't think it would have been an issue....I didn't see any smoke detectors, and there is no fire door separating a corridor of rooms from the main stairway / lobby. I am sure it meets whatever standards there are, and maybe there are smoke detectors, but I'd have felt reassured to see a smoke detector hard-wired in the ceiling of my room and in the corridor. I felt safe (and was on 1st floor), but the fire safety precautions are thigns I am always aware of when I stay away, and comment on when I post reviews here - maybe someone else staying at the hotel can provide more information on this. Overall a real gem of a place, wish there were more like it and I'm certainly going to return (as long as it's not always fully booked because of all these good reviews!).

<Content>Hotel de Varenne: A Great Find Visited Paris recently with my husband and son. And we are so lucky to have decided to stay at Hotel de Varenne (thanks to Trip Advisor reviews). Loved the Hotel. Our room was super clean, super cool (with airconditioning that looked new to me) and big enough for 3 people (me, my husband and 12 year-old son). And the bathroom was really elegant and squeaky clean! The extra bed was a real bed not a rollaway or folding bed which other hotels provide. What more, they had a pretty garden where we had breakfast every morning and which really gave me a high after a tiring day. We also enjoyed the breakfast of soft and warm bread, and yummy hot chocolat. The hotel is also located in a very quiet place (embassy row) and for people like me who prefer to go to a place that's quiet after a hectic and tiring day, this is the hotel for me. It's so convenient to reach anyway because it is just 200 meters away from a metro station (Varenne). And there is a mini grocery at the corner and a bakery that sells very good croissant right beside the hotel. I also found the staff very friendly. And what makes it more amazing is the hotel rate which is very reasonable compared to other hotels. I would go back to this hotel and recommend it to my family and friends!

<Content>Charming Parisian Hotel My husband and I, along with my inlaws spent 3 nights in this charming hotel! The staff were kind and helpful, and the rooms and bathrooms were well appointed. The hotel's neighborhood was also delightful, with good nearby resaurants and cafes, as well as the Rodin and Orsay museums. My favorite hotel feature was the beautiful courtyard where we ate all of our breakfasts.We look forward to making a return trip to this special hotel!

<Content>Charming My stay in Paris was a short one but the Hotel La Varenne was a soothing and charming haven for the night. It is well situated near major attractions and the metro line. The neighborhood is upscale and quiet with several great restaurants nearby. My room was pleasant and nicely decorated with its own bath.The staff was extremely helpful and spoke better English than my French. I highly recommend this hotel to other travelers. S. R.
