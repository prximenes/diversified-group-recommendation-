<Content>THE WORST HOTEL (MOTEL)!!!! This was THE WORST hotel (motel) I have ever stayed in. The room was filthy. I would not recommend this motel to anyone... not even my worst enemy. Room service was also terrible.... we never had our room serviced for the 2 days we stayed. The bed was very hard which gave myself and especially my husband bad back spasms. There was NO free internet access. The way the motel looked and smelled...parking should have been free. There was no kind of professional customer service. If this motel was to give us a free weekend stay...it would be a DEFINITE NO!! DO NOT STAY AT THIS MOTEL!! DO NOT STAY AT THIS MOTEL!!I rate this motel a (-10) negative ten.

<Content>Bad Customer Service When I first checked in, I walk to the front desk welcomed by the female employee on her cell phone and her friend taking a picture of her. I don't think that was a part of customer service training. When I get up to the room, nice but small. Parking at the hotel was convenient yet pricey, Parking attendants need training. Other than that it was allright.

<Content>Stay Away!!! This is. by far, the worst hotel I've ever stayed! Dirty room full of cockroaches, very noisy, smelly and expensive. Also, this hotel apparently found an extra source of income... prostitution. Just go to floors 7 or 8 and wait for few minutes around 11PM. I have no idea how this hotel got 2 stars! Based on what? The only good thing I wasn't bitten by bedbugs...lucky me...

<Content>No wireless internet as promised! There is no wireless internet. I called the hotwire staff right after I made the reservations and the representative helped me to phone the hotel right away and confirmed the hotel have wireless internet access. But there is no wireless internet when I got there even on the lobby of the hotel. I had to pay extra for the wireless internet but the connection was still soooooooooooooooo slow.It's totally not what the hotwire representative told me!

<Content>We stayed only out of desperation We only had 24 hours on Oahu and planned our vacation to the letter except for our stay here. No hotels available so we booked this place through hotwire. We arrive at the front desk at 10:30 p.m. and they didn't have our reservation. We were almost opting to sleep on the beach after watching the parade of interesting people and working girls around the construction site of a lobby. After getting hotwire on the phone to resolve our reservation problem and checking out the room, we decided to stay. Our room was clean. The carpet was new and the bathroom very clean. Old but clean. The rooms are independently owned so some can be much newer than others. I was looking for clean and moderately priced and that's what I got. Think of a cinderblock high rise, because that's what this place is. The location is great, but one night was enough for me. Never again if I can help it.

<Content>Perplexed Compared to many, I have been lucky not to find bed bugs. However, the toilette didn't flush, and the drain was clogged with hair. The walls are extremely thin so to hear the tenants next to you. In my case, I ended up with a gay couple as neighbors, who was totally unbearable. I had to fight with my neighbors to have them shut up. They would fight at 3 a.m. for instance.I work and study and on a budget, so i couldn't just say, enough I'm leaving. The carpet was disgusting and the bed covers had cigarette burns and bugers. The good side was that the previous tenant left two sets of towels, dishes and burners. The management was also helpful...they fixed the flush and replaced malfunctioning appliances for free. The downside is that your comfort is dependant on your neighbors.

<Content>donot book with hotels.com Be very careful of your reservation. Don't book with them, they are scammers and will steal you money! I booked and then had to cancel 2 days after and they wouldnt refund the money! Their policy was outdated and was inconsistent to their online policy of cancellation either 24, 48 or 72 hours prior...STAY AWAY FROM BOOKING WITH THEM.

<Content>Good value for the price! We were very pleased with our room for the price that we paid. It was in fair condition and clean. The staff was courteous and let us check-in 2 hours before the official time. I would highly recommend this hotel for those who want a clean, safe place to sleep but would rather spend their time  money on other things. John  Rachel

<Content>Ok for the modest price Ok for the price and only if your are staying a day or two. This is one of the least expensive ok hotels in Waikiki and is in fair location (a little far to lug things to the beach, close to shopping and other Waikiki activities, good from a driving point of view)Parking is $12. Room had microwave and small frig. Free Internet was available only in the lobby.Bathroom toilet wasn't flushing but housekeeping was there within 2 minutes both times we called.Room was adequate and clean and was worth the modest price (Hotwire).There are a few better hotels under $100 if you are planning a longer stay.

<Content>good location I travelled to Honolulu, with my family from Australia we firstly booked the sister hotel the Resortquest Circle would definately never recommend that hotel for any family, the room was like a shoe box. Requested to be moved out, so stayed at the Monarch and was put on the 20th floor with good views, only problem we had 2 single beds and a sofa for a family, not really practical. The maid service was very bad, in 10 days did not have linen changed, beds just pulled up and sofa not even touched, did not vaccum floors, wipe benches. Air con very noisy and didnt seem to cool the room down.The spa was out of order for half the vacation, which was very inconvenient.The lady on the front desk was very helpful and kind.

<Content>Just okay Got this as part of an Orbitz package... It was adequate, except the room had twin beds, and the shower curtain was mildewed and smelly. Finally got that replaced after two calls to the desk. Quite a distance from the beach, but TheBus stops a block away. Close to Ala Moana shopping.

<Content>hotel for just sleeping and shower I was a bit worried to stay this hotel because of bad reviews. But my room was OK fortunately, no bugs, no dirty carpet. There was bath tab (but really dirty).As somebody said the blanket was smelly. I think traveler should bring room shoes and Fabreze!If you look for a hotel just for sleep and shower, this hotel will be reasonable price and close to Waikiki and Ala Moana.PS. My floor was 15F. Elevator area was dirty cause they are painting wall, door, everywhere. I saw a lot of notice there.

<Content>Needs to be torn down. We had a 12 hour stopover in Honolulu on our way home to Australia and I booked this through Priceline.com without knowing the hotel name - just the general location. Well the location was fine (walk to Waikiki action) but the hotel, if you could call it that, was vile. The very best thing about it was the girl on the desk, who was lovely. The room was hideous, pubic hair was on the bathroom floor, stained and chipped mismatched furniture throughout, dank hallways, it felt like I was going to crash through the bath bottom while showering (oddly the water pressure was good though). Terrible curtains that did nothing to block out the morning sun. There was a big cigarette burn in the bedspread. Need I go on? It really does need to be torn down. The one redeeming feature is Cheeseburger in Paradise, which has great burgers and is across the road. We've backpacked through Southeast Asia and stayed in many dives, for some reason, this dump just seemed so much worse - probably because it cost 9 times as much as something similar in Southeast Asia!!!

<Content>Not what i expected... carpets where DISGUSTING like someone threw up on every inch, my hotel bathroom floor was sticky so i wore my shoes the enitre time from out of the tub to leaving. they didnt even have an alarm clock or iron/ironing board. the person at the front desk is also the bell hop so it took forever to get new towels or an iron...this hotel was cheap and good if you are not going to be in your hotel ever, except for the 8 hours you are sleeping. nice view, parking was horriable, $9 a day and sometimes the lot would be full...this hotel has something like 26 floors and only 5 VERY small floors for parking. if you wanted a spot you need to get there before 5pm or you are screwed for the night and will have to park somewhere else and walk EVEN though you have already paid.

<Content>Stay anywhere but Here!!!!! A total surprise! I booked this trip as part of my Rest and Recuperation leave for duty in Iraq. I have slept better in the bunkers of Iraq and Afghanistan. I was truly disappointed that Expedia would include this hotel as part of their package deal. This place was dark, dirty, dingy and gloomy from the entrance to every floor the elevator stopped on. The on site laundry room was too expensive and the front desk only provided minimal change as not to run out for other guests. I was afraid to spend too much time there anyway; and they charged for the ice. PLEASE spend the extra money to upgrade to a better hotel. We learned our lesson on this one. I will always check the reviews prior to booking a hotel room with Expedia.com.

<Content>Not suitable for my enemies! Our original booking was with Sand Villa, but they sold our reservation to this place...The guy at the front counter had enough nerve to complain about someone being barefoot in the lobby when we were checking in. It turns out that that barefoot person should have been worried about what diseases he might incur while walking in this putrid establishment. Here's what we encountered: (1) A very negative person at the front counter (2) An additional $9 a night for parking (3) An unsafe surroundings (4) Dirty, worn, and stained carpets throughout (5) Holes in carpet (6) Bugs on counter in bathroom and on microwave (7) Smoke-smelling pillows (8) Partial shower curtain (9) Stained sheets (10) Stained walls... I could go on... I have stayed in many a hostel and even slept on floors of kitchens in Amsterdam, and this place beats them all! We weren't going for the hotel, but we did expect a minimal effort...None to be found at The Monarch! You're better off camping with the homeless on the windward side of the island! (Travelocity did ensure that we got a refund and we ended up staying with family on the island.)

<Content>In need of renovation Their site says they are a 3-1/2 star, but elsewhere they are rated a two. It's comparable to a hostel.The first day we were told they had just transitioned and are now under new management. Knowing that, we held our breaths for what we'd experience. We stayed on the 23rd floor where all carpets and sheets were stained. My mom found a bug in her bed, and we were disappointed to find that the room was NOT cleaned when we had returned from town. The bath-tub was questionable, and the room, and elevators smelt retched. The coffee pot was dirty, and the floor so stained that we decided to keep our flip-flops on the whole time. The redeeming aspect of the hotel is the fact that the new management is planning to change things. Hopefully they have the funds to gut the whole facility and start from scratch. I鈥檇 expect the hotel to be suitable in perhaps six months from now. I wish them good luck on their remodel.

<Content>Anywhere but here I had to stay in this hotel and had a horrible experience also. There putrid smell made me stay out of the room as long as I could until bedtime. Bed mattress--a hygenic biohazzard. Be careful of the activity in the community areas at nighttime. Be safe.

<Content>The Last Place You Want To Stay Got a really bad bug bite at this hotel. Skin-burrowing mite lives in the bed.I was the first victim, and the painfully itchy red spots spreading rapidly, and even after I got home, it's still increasing. Just yesterday the red spots started to grow on the skin of the person I went with. I saw some kind of insect laying dozens of white tiny eggs on the drainage of air conditioner.The door makes squaky sound all day. Everyone I see at this hotel does not look healthy, and I saw in my very eyes the police investigator interviewing the crying female resident of this hotel at the lobby!!! I could not believe my eyes. What kind of hotel is this? Trust me, I could not rest at this hotel.People should not use this hotel.Even if it costs a bit more, you should get a decent hotel. This is the last place you want to stay in the whole world. I am asking the travel agent to return the money.

<Content>good, cheap place to stay This is a discount, high-rise hotel geared to budget travelers. If you want to stay somewhere fancy, you shouldn't go to a place that is giving away $40 rooms on Priceline.The location is fine (it's not in the ghetto, as one truly ridiculous review said), but you will have a short walk to the beach and some other areas in Waikiki. The service is fine. The hotel is average as a whole.If you're coming to Hawaii to enjoy the outdoors and only need a place to rest your head at night, this hotel will do just fine. I enjoyed my stay.

<Content>Helpful Staff, Good Stay I too booked my stay here before reading any reviews, but I was pleasently suprised with our stay. The carpets and rooms could use a little face lift, but the staff frienliness really made up for that. They were so helpful from the front desk clerk to the bellperson everyone was very nice. It is not the Ritz Carlton so if you are looking for an upscale hotel this is not it. They have spectacular views we had a great one from the 21st floor. It is a short walk to the beach unless you are in horrible shape you should not have a problem. My husband and I had a great time. There are plently of restaurants within walking distance. We had a great stay!

<Content>Clean and safe I booked this hotel early this year through Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays. I booked it because it was inexpensive and before I read any reviews of the place. After having read some of the reviews, I was dreading this vacation.We checked into this hotel September 7 and departed September 13. Thankfully, we were pleasantly surprised by the Hawaiian Monarch. It was out of the heart of Waikiki (which we liked), and although the rooms were rather small (similar to those in Manhattan hotels), ours was clean and safe. Admittedly, the halls and the lobby could use some updating. And it might be nice if the elevators were air conditioned. The pool was very nice (a little spartan perhaps) but we only spent a couple of hours there one evening while doing a load of laundry.Others have noted that there are not a lot of amenities at this hotel. This is true, so if you want a hotel with a restaurant, room service, spa, etc. don't stay here. But if you want a safe, clean place to shower and sleep, the Hawaiian Monarch is worth the money.The desk staff was very helpful, as was the bell captain. Considering how little time my husband and I were in our room, we're glad we didn't blow a bunch of money on another hotel. The Hawaiian Monarch met our needs quite nicely.Our 19th floor room had a mountain view that was just beautiful.

<Content>will never stay there again Satyed there from Aug 31, 2004 until Sep 7th, 2004.This should be called a motel not a hotel. The carpets were dirty. There is no room service, but there is a famouse fast food chain next door. It was in the 90's and there was no air conditioning in the elevators. The rooms had those small window units that you find in some backwoods mom and pop motel in the middle of nowhere. The rooms were about the same too. Many of the units are being sold off to buyers, so needless to say, in the mornings we awoke to the sent of ciggerettes blowing in under the door. The front desk said we could stuff our 2 towels under the door to stop the smell from comming in. When we arrived there were multiple police cars present for some reason. We saw them there often during our stay. There was a nice pool, however no hot tub, and no towels at poolside (had to use the ones we stuffed under the door.) And where did they come up with the only a short walk to the beach and shopping? Long hot walk to all the attractions. Felt like I was in the getto surrounded by low income housing. Might be OK for someone on a REALLY TIGHT budget, but would be too embarresed to recomend to a friend. NEVER AGAIN. Do yourself a favor and spend the few extra dollars on a nicer hotel that is close to the attractions. Oh yes!!!, forgot to mention, a day befor we checked out, they had the nerve to slip a note under the door to tell us we had to be out by noon. Go figure.

<Content>An Experience Not To Be Endured We stayed there for a total of 12 nights in November 2003 and although we knew it was a 'budget hotel' we still got one heck of a shock. Trust me the tour brochure pictures and the reality are vastly different. For starters the entrance and lobby are shabby not to say the least, complemented with carpets full of holes and tares. The resturant (if you can call it that) is akin to some sort of downtown sleaze bar and the hotel shop is nothing short od a joke. Be prepared to be followed around by the 1 member of staff. The hallways resemble a prison interior and that said, still need a new paint job. The rooms are tidy but basic. The bathroom and the windows do have mould around the edges and what is it with charging for in-room coffee. In short you can do far better for the kind of money you are going to be paying - give this hotel a miss! O' and what ever you do, don't smoke in the rooms - the staff go nuts.

<Content>A clean and safe place for Waikiki I grew up at an early age (1963) in Waikiki. I live on the mainland the past 25 years but go for visits. I has always avoided staying in Waikiki like a pleague has hit. This trip I had no choice. Another reviewer - a woman - left a review earlier this year that really helped my husband and I decide. She said it was a key carded room with very good grounds and parking lot security. She said she could stay by herself and feel safe. That was good enough for us. We stayed from 5/9 to 5/14... Rm. 1714 with a mountain view. The room was really nice and as the lady said, I would stay there again because it is very safe! Great safe place for the $$

<Content>Not Reccommended! We have just returned from a 2 centre holiday which consisted of 3 days in Las Vegas and 7 days in Oahu, Honolulu. It was our first visit to both places and we enjoyed them both immensely. Circus Circus was the hotel in Las Vegas and no problems were encountered, in fact we would liked to have stayed longer. Oahu was simply paradise but the Castle Hawaiin Monarch Hotel was a disgrace. We have travelled to lots of different places and stayed in lots of hotels worldwide and this without doubt was the worst we have ever encountered. I have no idea what the nightly rate is as we booked it as a package here in England. To keep it simple, it is dismal, dark and drab. It is the most un-welcoming place we have ever seen. The entrance to hotel reception is appalling. The rooms are 'furnished' to an extremely poor standard and the bed linen was disgraceful. Dirty, holed and unironed would be a good discription for starters. Its a long way to travel to be disappointed and we certainly were that. DO NOT go to this 'hotel' even if you want the basics as you will regret it totally. Oahu is beautiful, very clean, the people are delightful, the flowers are sensational but the Castle Hawaiin Monarch is awful.

<Content>Plesantly Surprised! We have just spent 10 nights at the Hawaiian Monarch Hotel/Condos and were plesantly surprised - having read some of the reviews beforehand we thought we were going to hate the place. We were on the 10th floor, corner room with many views of the city, the room was small but perfectly acceptable for two of us, house cleaning, the laundry and pool were very good. Would recomend it at that price!

<Content>Terrible hotel Stayed here three nights. Had requested non-smoking room. Got smoking room. Hotel said they didn't have any non-smoking rooms. Very small room with twin beds. Dirty drapes with cigarette burns. Window airconditioner. No alarm clock or radio. No hair dryer. Packet of coffee in room is $1.56. Ice is twenty five cents. Cockroach on ceiling. No restaurant. Drab hallways that need painting. Hotel is old and dingy. Would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Place If You're On A Budget This is a great hotel for someone on a budget. I actually paid around $250 for four nights. Not too shabby for a place I only slept at during my visit to Honolulu. It was definitely within walking distance of the beach and other areas. True, this is not a Hyatt or Hilton, but rather along the lines of an older Holiday Inn perhaps. The halls are definitely line with worn carpet and funky pink paint. I stayed on the 21st floor and had a fun view of the city/mountains/canal. The staff was very friendly but the elevators old and slow. I think I would stay there again, but if traveling with my wife, I may drop a few extra bucks and go someplace a bit nicer.

<Content>Good Value for Money I stayed at this hotel for 9 nights. It is a basic budget hotel but clean. I felt safe there due to the security cards required for the elevator and the security guard at night (good place for single women to stay). The phone calls are expensive 0.75 cents per call. The only drawback is it is a loooooong walk to the beach and amenities but it is away from the hussle and bussle and is quiet. It is also close to the Ala Moana shopping centre. I would stay there again but it is good value for the money. Keep in mind some rooms are better than others so if you are not happy ask for another room.
