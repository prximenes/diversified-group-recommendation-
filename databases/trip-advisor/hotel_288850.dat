<Content>Why aren't all hotels like this ?! Where to begin. The rooms are just perfect. Enough space, super comfortable beds and linen, good TV service, free fast internet connection, bathroom that you want to copy for your own home and room service that is actually worth the money.Then there's the free health spa down on the 1st floor, complete with pool, sauna, steamroom, relaxation room, different types of showers, ice for body scrubbing, and massages available for reasonable rates.I know I sound like I work for the company, but this is my second time staying here, and think it's one of the best designed contemporary hotels in the region, perfect for a few nights business trip.Highly recommended.

<Content>Great Hotel, especially compared to others in the city center I was in amsterdam for a business trip and I spent 2 night at the Dorint .I arrived at the hotel at 2am in the night and had no problem with the check-in. I had an executive room which was great. It was much better (and cleaner) than previous hotels I have stayed in in the center of Amsterdam. The room was clean and was quiet. Anything you could need in your room was available. I liked the fact that you can choose the temperature of Air conditioning and also the sliding door between the room and the entrance / bathroomI had free internet (network cable was already in the room). The quality of the breakfast was good (although it was expensive).The hotel is quite far away from the center, which was not very convenient for me.

<Content>Second great year My company is a charter airline and for the second year in a row we have based numerous crews in The Dorint. Two months in 2007 and four months in 2008. We have had upwards to seventy five individuals in the hotel at any one time. The facility is superb with good food and drink available at reasonable prices. Additional services include the Spa, bikes, smart cars, and buses to downtown and airport ,free of charge. The Dorint backs up to The Amsterdam Woods which beats Central Park for its trails, canals, and amenities. The Pancake House is a must. After experiencing The Dorint on my own last year(07) I took my family this year and the stay was a huge hit. We will return in 09. Ross Fischer CEO Miami Air.

<Content>The best Hotel during our Trip At the end of our Trip we stayed in this beautifull Hotel.Compared to the other hotels this was a very pleasant experience. Friendly Shuttle bus driver from the airport to the hotel, froiendly check in, a good room with an amazing bed.Only comment was that the temperature in the room was a bit high.There is an impressive Gym/Spa an even a massage treatment for 22 euro! delightfull after a 10 hour flight i must say.A breakfast buffet you can not believe, and the bar is open 24 hours and was very in expensive. We had dinner however downtown, not in the Hotel.We know Amsterdam, but for people who want to see the downtown area you might consider this Hotel a bit far out, but they offer a shuttle that drives into town in 20 minutes.Very clean, very friendly staff.Our room even looked out on the forrest?? All in All a great experience with good value for money( euro 165.00 for a double)

<Content>Very nice hotel ...made my first trip to AMS extreemly esteem I have visited Amsterdam on my last trip to Europe, i have never been to The netherlands b4r. this hotel has made my this frist trip to AMS very memorable and esteem. i liked the hotel from all point of veiw. i have visited The Neatherland as a guest of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and they have arrainged my accomodation for 10 nights in the this hotel. the check in staff was very cooperative and very obliging. they have allowded me to early chack in as there reguler check in time is at 1400hrs. but they allowed me to check in at 0900hrs. Atcually i was booked in Sharaton which is there just in front of schipol Airport. but due to Unavailability of the rooms for all of us in the sharaton they have asked me and my few other fellow guest to stay for 1 night at this hotel but after being stayed here for one night we dint felt to check out from here and to go to sharaton so , we all have desided to stay here only.Here not only front office staff but the restaurant staff was also very humbeld and allwasy smiling. the breack fast room is quite specious and nicely decorated equipped with all the eminities and facility which requiers to serve the guest in betterway.the rooms are also very nicely decorated and maintain.so all n all this hotel is worth of staying and worth of paying( eventhough i havent paid for but still) .after that first saty i have allways asked KLM to book me in the same hotel for next two of my visit to AMS and will allways ask in future also to book in the same hotel.As it is very near to the Airport and not so far from city center. If you want to saty for peacfull yet near to city then i would recommand this hotel for sure....

<Content>Great Hotel What a great hotel. Everything about this hotel smacks quality. The rooms are nicely furnished and as has been said before have everything and more than one wants. This is a very relaxing hotel at weekends (I have stayed in the week and it is a bit busier with stopovers and company seminars) but at week-ends when we stayed it was convenient for the airport and also for train services back to Amsterdam. We ventured into town on a couple of occassions and also hired a little Smart car to visit the beaches of Holland which are well worth a visit, especially if you can get the weather right. Once back at the hotel my wife and I made good use of the spa and gym facilities. Just a word of warning the sauna/steam and relaxation area are all clothing optional as with most in Holland and most of the Dutch and Germans do look dis-approvingly at anyone who enters with a costume. My husband and I do not have a problem with going au naturel but be warned if you are not happy stripping off. If we had to make one criticism it was the cost of eating in the hotel, especially with the plunging 拢. But all in all enjoy the great facilities. Have a look on Ebay as the hotel put a special weekend package together and auction it on the site. We will be back.

<Content>Great Nights Sleep! After 24 days of hotels, we ended our Trafalgar tour here. Although it was far from city center, the rooms were worth it. The beds have a great feather bed on top, and you can order pillows to match your needs. It also has a special closet with all kinds of amenities. If you are coming from City Center, beware of taxis - we were told that there was construction (which there wasn't any) and so we had to go the long way and that tacked on about 5 euros.

<Content>Excellent ... For an airport hotel (Take your own Ethernet cable !) Aiport hotels are well known for being awful. This one is not, though it is on the otherside of the airfield to the airport so buget 15-20 minutes to get to the terminal at least. The rooms are modern, well appointed, quiet with aircon and you get free wired internet in room. One wrinkle with this is that you have to either bring your own ethernet cable to plug between the wall socket and your PC, or traipse back to reception (who don't mention this on check-in), who will lend you one after putting a refundable deposit on your room in case you make off with their cable at checkout. This is just weird - the hotel is not cheap and what you get is worth paying for, but bearing in mind that 99.5% of guests are there on business and you have to ask why they would do this to guests in the first place and not just leave cables in the room like every other hotel on the planet ? There is secure underground parking at the hotel which had pink lady parking bays near the hotel entrance which I thought was a nice touch - even though it meant I had to to park further away ! Overnight parking was 20 euros. I arrived late and didn't get to try the food, but the restaurants looked busy and there were several. All in all, expensive, but well done and I would return - just take your own ethernet cable.

<Content>A good Hotel at Schipol A good and modern hotel for a layover at the airport or as I stayed, for a 2 day conference.The rooms are comfortable and have all the needs for a short stay. Tea and coffee making in the room and iron and ironing board. Good buffet breakfast and other meals also well catered for.The conferencing suite was very efficient and things just workedI will stay again.

<Content>Good for an airport hotel. After staying at the Dorint for one night, I would say that it is a pretty good hotel, and is very handy for those who have layovers or are in Amsterdam for a short time. We booked a triple room, and I pleasantly surprised that they brought in an actual bed for the third bed, rather than a pull out couch like other hotels I have experienced. The rooms were modern and comfortable and had some nice touches like heated tiles in the bathroom which were great during winter.It is quite far from the city centre however, but the hotel does have buses running back and forth, but as we were in amsterdam for a short time, we weren't able to use them. Car parking is handy for those who have a car like we did. Free internet access is also available in the foyer as well which is nice.There are a couple of resturants within the hotel, and we ate at the sports bar which gave us a pretty good meal that we all enjoyed. There isn't anything else around the hotel though, except for hotels, so if you want to go take a look around, it is quite far from anything.But for a short stay, it's a great place!

<Content>Great airport hotel I spent a night at this hotel, and was very impressed. I'm used to airport hotels being bland and medicore; this was a pleasant experience in a modern hotel with good facilities. As well as the usual restaurants - which were of good quality - there was a nice bar area that felt like a pub rather than an impersonal airport hotel.The rooms were well equipped and spacious, with a very comfortable bed and good amenities. Breakfast was a decent buffet with a reasonable choice of food. I found the hotel staff to be helpful and friendly.The shuttle bus from the terminal seemed to run less regularly than that of some of the other hotels - in the fifteen minutes that we waited for a bus, some other hotels had two buses who had stopped in the same area - but other than that, I had a very good stay.

<Content>Top Notch airport hotel Having tried several AMS airport hotels ( Courtyard, Crowne Plaza and Hilton ) this hotel certainly beats all three. It already starts with the proper big shuttle bus they use unlike the others who use tiny ones and make it very unpleasant when it is busy.My first stay ever at this German chain started well.Check in was friendly, warm and efficient.The rooms are excellent. Finally one has thought about the design of the rooms. The entrance door does not slam and no light seeps in during the night. In order to have a real quiet sleep they have a sliding door which devides the entrance area and the sleeping area so even during the day much less noise. What a simple but effective idea.The bathroom has heated mirrors so no fogging up. It is one of the few hotels I have stayed in where they have this. I also thought the little vanity area near the second hairdryer in the room was a good idea. Curtains are of the black out kind and let hardly any light in. The pull out cupboard with the ironing board is another tidy solution instead of the usual ( taking up space ) iron board in the wardrobe.Ah what a joy to have such a well designed room. Please other hotel chains have a look at the guest rooms in this property.....Clean, modern design with high housekeeping standards.The waitress in the bistro was another example of fine welcoming service. Wonderful.Oh boy I sound too positive but this is one of those rare moment were everything seems to work.The Wellness club is also excellent. Nice spacious area with a huge sauna and steam bath which is so hot I almost fainted. They also have a cooling down area with 2 showers and crushed ice to really cool down. Nice one.They already offer breakfast at 5am and the buffet starts at 06:30. This is what every airport hotel should do.I certainly will make this my favorite AMS airport hotel. I highly recommend this property. It is an recommendation I do not often make.

<Content>It's quite good but.... I have just spent a night at this hotel during my last business trip in Amsterdam.The hotel it's a modern and comfortable building: I have appreciated both the room and the wellness area that has the sauna and a little swimming pool.Moreover the location is convenient for its location: close to the airport and not too far from downtown (it takes about 15 minutes to get there with the well organized shuttle bus provided by the hotel at 14 Euros for a round trip)The problems I have experienced are with the staff, kind but often imprecise in their activities: they lost the reservation of my colleague (done together with mine), the day after, without any reason, they tried to bill two nights instead of one to my colleague and finally, when we booked in advance a taxi, at the time requested no taxis where outside the hotel awaiting for us鈥o we where obliged to take a shuttle to get the airport.Conclusions: the hotel it鈥檚 OK but the service could be dramatically improved!

<Content>Very Very Rude Staff It was the worst hotel where I've ever stayed..!!!! I never can forget how rude the staff was!! They were kind of neglecting customers, and they never accept our complain. They think of customers as source of money!!!!! They charged us the internet fee. But we thought a room directory says internet is free of charge. When I asked them to show us a room directory after check out , they said they couldn't. Their attitude was so rude that I couldn't stand it. But their attitude was not better. At least, they could show us take us a room directory and show us. Do you think it is really hard work? I was complaining about it, but they were not trying to listen to me. They only said to me I should pay the internet fee. I was really hurt. It really freak me out. I am really upset about their mean and rude attitude, rather than the fact I paid the internet fee. If you want to make such good memory in Netherland, never ever stay in this hotel!!!!!!!!

<Content>Abysmal service The Dorint Sofitel advertises itself as having every facility, but what they neglect to mention is that they require a deposit before you use anything. It's probably the worst hotel we've ever stayed in. It's not terribly clean, and the staff are rude.When we checked into the hotel鈥攈aving paid for our night's stay and breakfast in advance鈥攚e were further asked for a deposit of 鈧?0 before we could use any hotel facilities. We paid this. Then we made about four short international calls and were informed that those four short international calls had used up our deposit, and asked to come down and pay them more money. We said we would not like to, since we were exhausted after a long flightand not sleeping the whole night as well as the whole day, so could someone come and collect the money from us? After all, the hotel advertises itself as a super-luxury four-star hotel. The staff and the managers I spoke to flatly refused to send anyone to collect the money and were in fact rude, saying that since other guests had cheated them, we would have to pay the penalty for that. So, for instance, if you want room service, and you don't happen to have a credit card, you have to first go and pay a deposit at the reception.What I completely fail to understand鈥攄espite having travelled all over the world and stayed at a fairly large number of different hotels鈥攊s how any hotel can get away with such extreme rudeness and disregard for its guests. I've never encountered this before. The whole attitude of the manager was that the hotel was doing us a great favour. Is this because we had already paid for our stay and therefore they felt they could behave in any which way they wanted? I don't know. What I do know is that I booked this stay in this hotel with the expectation that it would have all reasonable facilities and they would not treat me as if I were a criminal-in-waiting, especially when I had consistently and constantly paid what they had asked them for, and was in fact willing to comply with their requests for yet more, only asking them to fulfill their part, i.e. provide good service. Is it not misleading and inaccurate to advertise oneself as a four-star luxury hotel when one is not willing to provide good service or be courtesy to one's guests? Had I known of these policies, I would never have stayed at their hotel, and I strongly feel these policies ought to be outlined on their Web site so that any traveller can make an informed decision regarding where they want to stay, and not be duped into paying a large amount of money for services which are then considered to be pending payment regardless. In short, what they are saying is that they will not cheat us, while we will certainly cheat them.

<Content>An Amazing Nights Sleep! What a fantastic hotel. Located very close to the airport and easy to get to, there are free shuttle buses that take you from the airport to the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful on check in and the hotel is modern and clean with a sports bar that looked like it could be lively enough to have an enjoyable evening in but not too rowdy.The rooms were modern and very cleverly designed with a few little quirks - you must make sure your key card is in the card holder by the door to keep the lights on. There were speakers in the bathroom so you can still hear the tv when you're in the shower and the bed was the most comforable bed I think I've ever slept in! I got a fantastic rate through expedia and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Amsterdam.

<Content>Very Comfortable I just stayed overnight to catch an early morning flight and didn't use the restaurant etc. I needed a good night's sleep and certainly got that. The room was first class - a good size, the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, aircon/heating easily adjustable to individual needs, bathroom spotless and modern.The free shuttle bus to and from the airport terminal is every 30 minutes, journey time about 10 minutes. It's a dedicated bus so doesn't stop at other hotels. It's a large bus with easy access to get your luggage on and off.It's quite chaotic at the hotel transfer bus stop, too many people and buses for the space available, but this affects all transfer buses, not just the one for the Sofitel.

<Content>Good quality Business Hotel Am currently spending quite a bit of time in Amsterdam and as I am working in Amstelveen it is easier to stay nearer to work than head all of the way into Amsterdam. I generally dont think the standard of hotels in Amsterdam is great and if working there, tend to stay in the Hilton. But to avoid the longer journey, I have chosen to stay here every week now for a few weeks. And I have to say the quality of this hotel is really good. Rooms are clean, everything is open and spacious....good internet connection: though a bit pricey at 鈧?9 at night.... overall a very good business hotel...free shuttle also from the airport. Wouldnt be too keen on staying here if holidaying in amsterdam (costs 鈧?5 taxi from hilton) but fine if you want to be near airport. Food is a bit boring but then again that is only if you spend 20 nights in 1 month there...one thing: 鈧?3 for breakfast is a bit spicey. Be aware there is nothing around this area so can be very boring and if there for lesure best to head into town for accommodation. There is a nice walk in Amsterdamsebos (wooded area) near the hotel and the hotel give bikes out for free...and you can also get some nice restaurants in nearby Amstelveen. Note it is built near the original airport and now the area for provate planes etc...but I have not experienced any noise disruption there. Good hotel in all...but time for a change I think...for me at least

<Content>Nice twin towers We basically picked this one based on reviews written by other travellers on this site.So thank you everyone.The reviews were in general spot on. The hotel is very good, very clean and deserves its 4 stars.The people at the reception were friendly and professional. Rooms are big and clean. Everyone is helpful. The shuttle to and from the airport arrives and leaves on time (except once in 5 days).The only flip side is the fact that it is quite a distance from the city, which means, you only have limited places where you can eat. We tried all the hotels and restaurents at the airport. There is a chinese opposite the hotel but it is expensive.The hotel shuttle into the city is NOT FREE. It is 5 Euros one way per person. You wont need it, all you need to do is to go to the airport and take a train from platform 3. It'll take you to the city centre in 15 mins.If you are booking with expedia please note that you wil have to shell out 5% more thanks to something called city tax! There was a bit of a problem regarding this but the hotel manager could not help. You will need to take it up with Expedia.The food in the bar downstairs is very good, do try it.Also, try the gym and spa facilities. There was nobody there and we loved it!Overall, we think this hotel offers a clean, enjoyable  an inexpensive stay.

<Content>Fantastic hotel I stayed here for one night in May 2007. I was really impressed with this hotel.There is a free shuttle bus every 30 minutes to and from the airport. The bus drivers were all lovely and super helpful. This is the best way to go into Amsterdam too - bus to airport then train. Takes about 45 minutes all up. That said, Amsterdam not a fantastic city unless you are interested in the notorious side of things...Had a gorgeous room, hardly any plane noise. Great bed and bathroom, lovely R  G products. Room service was excellent. Free wifi in lobby etc which was such a help PLUS they have PC's with free internet access. There is a really good gym, mini pool, sauna etc. which are a great way to relax before or after a flight.Staff were really helpful and had the best English of hotel staff anywhere else in the Netherlands I had been.Breakfast is very good, not quite what I would expect from a 5 star hotel at home but still good. Just wish Europeans would get off that shocking percolated coffee and start offering a proper expresso...Highly recommended.Wish I could have stayed longer!

<Content>Great hotel overall I stayed at the Sofitel for one night with my parents. The room was beautiful and modern and the beds were incredibly comfortable. The sports bar off the lobby was fun as well - lots of people, reasonably priced drinks, and good food. My only complaint is the bar service was ridiculously slow - waiting 15 minutes every time you order a drink is crazy and things did not improve throughout the night.

<Content>Nice Bed!!! I needed a place to stay overnight and Accor hotels had a reservation desk in the Airport. I got one room at thier new hotel for 120 Euro including shuttle transportation to and from the airport/hotel. This was closer, newer and cheaper then the Courtyard by Marriott by over 50 Euro.It is a lovely hotel and the new shows. The beds were beautiful and the room minimalist modern decor. 1 thing that slightly irritated me is no bell service, but the room service was great and they have lots of in room treats including great bathroom ammenities and in room internet. But the pillows, linen and bed..... ahhh lovely.Most of the clientel appeared to be business people and the outside of the hotel is kind of ugly office building like and not very pretty. But once inside it is very nice! This would NOT be a good location for visiting the city center - too far away.They have a health center included a sauna, sanarium and turkish steam bath. Very nice.

<Content>Modern, business-oriented hotel Located next to Schipol Airport, this hotel is perfect for the business traveler. In addition, we had a great rate for a single night's stay.Everything is ultra modern, clean and functional. Staff is young and, in some cases, could use a bit of training in relation to customer service.Upon checking in, we were told that portage is not available at this hotel. Since the hotel caters mostly to the business traveler, most guests have one suitcase on wheels and can easily transport it to his/her room. However, we were told that if we could not handle our bags, they would arrange for assistance. The restaurant was pleasant and the food quite good. Our rate also included a fine breakfast.The free airport transfer was efficient and comfortable.We would stay here again.

<Content>Superb hotel I stayed here twice with my young son and found the place terrific. It's quiet and very, very comfortable and whilst out of town, is still very accessible thanks to a regular bus connection to the airport from where the train into the city runs every 20 minutes or so. The service is very good also ith friendly, courteous staff.The rooms are lovely - tastefully furnished with incredibly comfortable beds, tea/coffee facilities, iron and ironing board, internet TV, etc. One nice touch is the large sliding door which closes off the bedroom area from the lobby making it almost impossible to be disturbed by people in the corridor outside. Each floor has an ice maker. The lift can only be activated from the ground fllor by a room key which is a nice security touch.The only gripes I had were the lack of free kids TV channels (the pay per view kids movies cost a whopping 7.50 Euros each) and lack of kids meals in the restaurants, but then again this is predominantly a business hotel. Saying that, the waiter and chef in the Terrace restaurant could not do enough for us, and cooked whatever my son wanted without complaint.The hotel has bicycles for guests to use and they also have a couple of Smart cars which can be hired cheaply for a bit of sightseeing.

<Content>Great Business Alternative near the Airport I echo many of the other reviews on this hotel. It is a great business hotel with excellent amenities. While it is a little far from downtown, taxi service is available and they do offer a shuttle bus into downtown Amsterdam. Shuttle to the airport is every 30 minutes and then you can take a train into centraal station. Not really an issue unless you plan on some late night carousing.Breakfast is top of the line Dutch affair. Large assortment of typical dutch foods although the hot meals (eggs and waffles) are not really up to par with other business hotels in the area. If you are looking for a quiet and comfortable place to stay near the airport, this is a pretty good choice. I particularly like the free wi-fi in the lobby and restaurant areas. Very convenient for the business traveler.Happy travels!

<Content>Great airport hotel. Stayed for one night at this hotel in November 2006. Picked up from Schipol Airport by hotel courtesy bus which runs every 30 minutes throughout the day and up to midnight. About 10 minute transfer time. Hotel is well run, accommodation first class with all facilities working satisfactorily. Buffet breakfast excellent value.Hotel is about 45 minutes from central Amsterdam by public transport which is cheap, frequent and efficient. Cost wise this hotel is worth considering for a weekend break as it is much better value than more central hotels in Amsterdam and has very good facilities.Would definitely stay here again if passing through Amsterdam.

<Content>Great hotel, but no Amsterdam atmosphere Generally this is an excellent hotel, but not suitable for tourists who want to experience the city and late nights; however, great for stop overs or business. A shuttle service takes guests back and forth to the hotel during the day - the journey is approx. 10 mins. From the airport you can then catch a train into A'dam centre which takes around 30 mins. All-in-all I would allow one hour from leaving your room to reaching central A'dam. The hotel is situated in a business/office park on the edge of the airport so there are no amenities outside the hotel, nor nowhere to walk.I stayed in a standard room, which was very well furnished and clean, but I would have found it a bit small for two people. I was somewhat concerned about the feather beds and waking up with an allergic reaction - but they were very comfy. There are two restaurants and a bar (american style); the bar served reasonably prices food, approx. 20 euros for a meal. Breakfast was excellent, but 22 euros a pop. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Free wifi is available in the lobby and bar area, but no wifi in standard rooms! The tv had a good variety of channels, an on-demand movie service. (Parents beware of the adult channels - they are not completely locked and can be previewed.)My only criticism of service was the checking out procedure - this took 20 mins of waiting around, then dealing with a trainee, then dealing with someone else, during which time I was becoming increasingly nervous about missing my flight. Also the lobby was on many occasions swamped with people meeting for business workshops etc.

<Content>Great spa, soft beds My husband and I stayed 1 night as part of our honeymoon - no special treatment though :-( We caught the FREE hotel shuttle bus to and from the airport. It runs every 30 minutes and is bigger than the other hotels' buses so it's unlikely to be full, so no need to pre-book. The journey is about 15 minutes. The staff were polite and helpful.The only rooms left with a double bed (rather than 2 twins pushed together) were smoking rooms so we opted for the twins. In my opinion, the beds are too soft, but I guess that's a matter of preference. The room was very modern and nice.The spa facilities were excellent. It has a pool, sauna, steam room and sanarium (not as hot as the sauna) but no jacuzzi. All were clean, unisex. Clothes are optional.

<Content>This is a great value for those who likes outdoor and city life We stayed at the Dorient Sofitel for two nights in mid July. We flew in on Friday night and stayed at the Apple Inn downtown which was absolutely ghetto with a steep price of 160 euro. Then we came to Dorient Sofitel Airport Hotel the second night, thinking it might be a boring hotel but at least it would be clean. Yet, we really loved it and we liked it so much that we decided to stay an extra night. The price was great for Saturday night (75 euro with breakfasts) and Sunday night (110 without breakfast). The breakfast was the best one I had in Europe so far....I almost broke into tears when I found out that they can make omelette for me since food in Geneva ---- so bad. The hotel offers free bike rental so I went to ride around the forest nearby which is really really pretty on a good day. The complementary taxi ride really helped us to save a lot of money since taxi in Amsterdam is quite expensive. The ride was only about 11 min so everything worked out perfectly. Of course, there is a sauna and steam bath which are always big pluses for us girls!! We will definitely come back again!!

<Content>It's a wow Factor!! Oh what a night.... It's a great business hotel with lots of leisure facilities as well. The huge Spa is fabulous and the staff is great! Ask for a double wake up call as the beds are too comfortable with the special bed concept.Direct shuttle to downtown amsterdam (it's complimentary!!!!) and next to the forest....The night was short (due to the 24 hours sportsbar) was too good!Thanks guys it was the best of the best!

<Content>Fab Airport Hotel This hotel was fab all around. It was so close to the runway but could not here the planes at all, but you could seen them land!!!! There is a shuttle bus from the airpoirt to the hotel  back again which takes 10 mins. The lobby lounge was very well presented, very friendly staff, food was lovely too. The bedroom was a good size  as for the bed it was so comfortable, so got a good nights sleep. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. I would put this hotel much higher than a 4star in my mind.

<Content>An excellent hotel A very fine hotel:- Nice and modern rooms.- Super feather-beds - - Fitness center with new Technogym equipment etc. (complimentary)- nice swimmingpool (also complimentary)- Superb breakfast buffet.OK, it's far away from Amsterdam city center and out in nowhere, but it's very easy to get to the airport and the centre of Amsterdam. The hotel has a free shuttle bus to and from the airport (every 20 minutes from 6 am - midnight). And from the airport there are trains to Amsterdam central station every 10 minutes (cost 3,60 euro for a single ticket). Bottomline is, that you can do the trip from the hotel to the center of Amsterdam in maximum 45 minutes.There is also a free bus from the hotel to and from the city centre (2 or 3 times a day).

We stayed here before leaving amsterdam.I have never seen a hotel with such a nice design, ambiance and excellent staff.The health spa is stunning, they even have massage therapists, a personal trainer and a pool.The location is ofcourse not a downtown location but only 20 minutes with a free shuttle from the hotel non stop.

<Content>Great "airport" Hotel Excellent hotel. Clean, quiet, luxurious, efficient, outstanding fitness facilities. Great value via Web rates. We tried room service. It was fast and reasonable.Dedicated shuttle bus from Airport....about 10 minute trip.....runs every half hour.Would not recommend the hotel for Amsterdam sightseeing.....too far from downtown. But I'd highly recommend it for an overnight before or after a flight.

<Content>Splendid! I stayed in this hotel between 18th and 20th March during my trip to Netherlands. The overall quality is splendid. The room is excellent, large, clean and comfortable especially the bed. The bathroom is really good. The facility is okay. The service is superb, helpful and friendly. This hotel is situated in outskirt of Amsterdam. We have to take free shuttle bus which is operated between the hotel and Schiphol terminal every 30 minutes. The journey takes around 10 minutes. From the airport, you could take the train to Amsterdam central train station. The train departs around 4 times an hour. Additionally, the hotel has complementary free taxi service to Museumplein. This taxi runs 3 times a day (10.30, 19.30 and 23.50). Consider the roomrate, this hotel is really good-value because it's very hard to find such a good-quality hotel with spacious room for 98 euro per night in town center! The journey to town is not so difficult if you don't need to get back to the hotel frequently. I will definitely choose this hotel for my next visit to Amsterdam (except I have enough money to afford the Pulitzer, Dorint Mecure or Intercontinental). :)
