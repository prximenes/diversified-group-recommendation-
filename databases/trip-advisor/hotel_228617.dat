<Content>Bit far from centre of Barcelona I took my boyfriend away for a few days break and booked a mystery hotel, the hotel itself was fantastic, the receptionist was really helpful but we found it quite far out from the ramblers (centre) we had to catch a tram then a metro (took around 40 minutes in total) which only bothered us because we wanted to stay out late but the last tram was at 12 midnight (2 a.m on week-end) I would recommend the hotel, but if I was to go to Barcelona again I would stay somewhere alot closer as there aren't many shops or restaurants around the hotel (and the food is quite expensive at the hotel). We also got conned in a taxi from airport (should cost no more than 20 euros) but we got charged 30 euros - so stand your ground !! Other than that we had a fantastic time.

<Content>NOT near the beach but nice We chose this hotel according to the maps on this page, which show that the hotel would be near the beach. However, there are two Frederic Mombou street addresses in Barcelona and the real location is pretty far (40-50 mins to the city by tram+metro). There is practically nothing near the hotel, so you have to travel to get somewhere.Otherwise the hotel is nice, breakfast is good, gym is modern and the rooms are pretty big with nice bathroom. The staff could be a bit more happier though.

<Content>Great hotel far far away and poor staff ! Why I will not come back ! We stayed 6 days in August.The hotel is a 4* but compare to what you get, it should be not more than a 3*. Why :- It's 40 minutes from the city center (20 minutes of tram and an aditional 20 minutes of metro).- The room are large and cosy but very very very noisy. In the back room you are just in front of the main highway and in the front room the hotel have a problem with the air condition system and it's like you were sleeping neer the engine of a cruise ship !- The service staff in the looby made it seem like you were bothering them every time you asked a question.Just to give you and exemple, we asked for a pillow at 8PM and got it after 11PM. And if you ask for bathrobes, magazines or sleepers, they will look at you as if you were an alien from Mars or Venus !Good things are :- large room (perfect for families)- the staff for breakfast and at the bar is one of the best I ever experienced ! We came with a baby and every morning our table was set even before we asked. They took care of everything and were very friendly ! If you want information about the city, what to do, where to eat and what to see. just ask them.

<Content>Nice Hotel The hotel is excellent for the price. The room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was big and luxurious. Nice bed, well appointed furniture and TV and nice common areas too. Its location is a bit far away from the City, but not bad as there is a TRAM about 1/4 of a mile away, or even less, which connects you with the city. The location is safe and OK, but there is not much activity around the hotel -its lonely, but safe. There is a taxi stand outside the hotel door, which is very convenient if you want to take a taxi to the airport (approx. 20 euros). The staff does their job, but it seems that you are bothering them when you ask for something, but I noticed the same from many Spaniards, so it is not a big deal. If you want a nice, safe and reasonably priced hotel in the suburbs of Barcelona, Hesperia Sant Just is the place to go! I'd stay there again!

<Content>Will not go back We booked this through priceline which was a rip off as we paid $120 taxes included and their actual site on their website was about 70E a night.That put aside, we went there as my husband was going to a conference center 2 miles away. What a mistake.There is only the tram there so even to get to the conference center it took 30min and would have been quicker to take a direct metro from downtown. My mom joined us there and I went to pick her up at the airport which took 1.5h each way!!! A 3 hours RT, what a nightmare.Getting downtown was about one hour. At night once it took 2 hours as they don't run as often. This was a very bad choice.The hotel in itself is ok, the staff is not friendly and most do not really speak much English as they don';t really catter to tourist but to businessmen.Will definately never go back or recommend it. It is a a very industrial and depressing part of town. We stayed in the heart of downtown for our last 2 night and full price at HOTEL ONIX on la Rambla (right by Catalunya place) was 120E...the difference is not worth the hassle and the waste of your vacation.GENERAL BARCELONA TIP: Do not call a cab from the hotel, as they charge an extra 7E($10) plus they will charge you another 7E for 2 bags.

<Content>Hestaria! It was an interesting place. The service staff made it seem like you were bothering them every time you asked a question. The wireless internet went out in the hotel rooms, and we had to use the internet downstairs in the lobby. They charged us 3 euro for 15 minutes. It was crazy. The rooms were really clean and the beds were comfy. Its right on the outskirts of the main AV. Diagonal (the main road in Barcelona). But its a little tricky figuring out how to get from the hotel to the city and vise versa. Overall, its a place where locals stay when they visit the city. Not an ideal place if you are not familiar with the area.

<Author>Hotel_traveller32
<Content>Great hotel Hello fellow travellers, well here i go again with one of my long but informative reviews. This is the first time i have visited Barca ina few years and was surprised to see a lot of change, and its all for the better. A new extension to BCN airport, looks new, good and well managed.new trains, platforms, sad to see smaller trains from the Airport tho, these fill up very quickly but very modern and comfortable and of course, the magic word........ CHEAP.we arrived at the hotel and was instantly amazed, beautiful, clean, attentive friendly staff, dont be afraid to ask them anything, If you cannot speak spanish dont worry, english seems to be a speciality, check-in was a breeze, we was given room 519, we got in the lift up to the 5th floor, and found quite a few stains on the carpets, not a major thing but i am into presentation. the room was big and the bathroom was gorgeous, not too much room for hanging clothes but not a problem, Air Con is brilliant keeps you as cold as you want. The hotel advertises a gym, squash courts and a turkish bath, the gym is small but good, there is indeed a squash court, but the turkish bath is just a steam room, the sauna isnt on, its a cold relax room. Breakfast if you have it is not all that, but they had a special on breakfast 10 euros per person per day, not including tax (7%) there is a good range of foods available for breakfast, rolls, croissants, pain au chocolats, cereals, toast, fresh fruit, yoghurts and a cooked breakfast, but its always cold. if you can get the special rate for breakfast your saving yourself 5 Euros a time and its well worth it.Cant comment on Evening restaurant as it was closed for refurb.The hotel is a good distance from Barca city, but dont be put off, its a tram ride and tube ride away and you will be so glad of the quietness. althought the young people were moaning, even though like us they got it on priceline.co.uk. if you want something central choose your own hotel. we paid 35euros a night for 2 people which for a 4 star is brilliant. its not often i say this but buy your Euros before you leave the UK, not many change places and can be quite expensive.If you need any information on Barcelona, drop me an email, and i will try my best to answer any questions you have.Have a good time, stay safe and beware of pickpockets.Preston and Carl

<Content>Wonderful hotel for non-tourists..... Great hotel as mentionned by everyone but the distance to the center of Barcelona was a problem. Yes the tram/metro journey is convenient but they stop at midnight on weekdays and 2am on weekends so for night people this is not concevient. This hotel is top notch but only if you are in that subeuban area on business. If you are a tourist I recommend you stay clear of this distant hotel.

<Content>Very comfortable .modern hotel Rooms are very spacious and comfortable.This is a modern hotel ideal for Business trips or early departures /late arrivals from Barcelona airport.Hotel located at aprox 10mins away from Barcelona Airport ( Taxi costs EUR 22).There is a gym and sauna FOC.The Restaurant offers traditional Castillian style cuisne,specially Roasted Lamb.The food was excellent but a little overpriced as I personally thought the service could have been better.

<Content>A great deal on Priceline I used Priceline and selected West Barcelona and suburbs and I have to say initially I was a little disappointed that we got the suburbs. I read other feedback on this hotel and agree that it was tricky to find not least of all since our GPS had it in the wrong location as a POI. I finally keyed in the town of Sant Just then the street and we found it fine. We were happy the hotel had a garage and followed tripadvisor traveller's advice and took the tram into town every day. It was no big deal and a pleasant ride to Palau Royal to pick up the metro or tourist open deck bus or to the end of the line at Francesa Mascia where you can pick your choice of 2 open deck tour bus routes.It was a really nice hotel and we were glad we didn't have to deal with driving down town. So, if you don't mind taking the tram, this is a great base for Barcelona.

<Content>good hotel ....but!!!!! lovelly clean, spacious rooms, although the fluctuating shower temperature was a problem, building site right outside our fifth floor, front window, although very little noise was heard, however there was a wedding party one night and the noise was very bad ,well into the early hours. The hotel staff were very good and on the whole quite pleasant. However, the travelling distance into Barcelona as mentioned by other visitors was a pain!!, although the tram was punctual it really did get to be very boring and time consuming every day, over all the price we paid (just over 1.700 euros) was FAR too much for the inconvenience, put the hotel in Barcelona town and it would have been fantastic. We would not return to this hotel again purely because of the distance.

<Content>Awesome hotel People have commented about the location however this was no problem.The tram need to get to the metro is a 2 minute walk, whilst the actual tram journey only takes around 30 minutes or less. Once onto the metro it is easy to make your way to the attractions. The hotel room was to a high standard, nice beds, amazing lcd tv, and high quality bathrooms. The view isn't great from the hotel and the pillows are slightly uncomfortable however these are the only problems we found. The hotel staff are also really friendly. I recommend this hotel if you a taking a city break, especially if you have a package deal with a company.

<Content>4* is over rated for this hotel This Hotel is too far out of town, In order to commute into town you will require a change of tram and metro inwhich takes up an hour each journey. The hotel staff were uninviting and rude, Items where added to our bill without any purchases and when this was made aware to the staff there simply was no apologising. The lift and hallway had this stentch of sick. The decor was nice and calming altho very basic facilities. Hotel stated there was a turkish bath but to no avail. Good equipment in gym and adequate steam room. Food was nice but to a small portion and high prices. All in all was an OK stay but certainly wont return. P.S please be vigilant as there are lots of pick pocketers, my friend learnt the hard way, and also if you do realise and manage to get your wallet back please make sure your money is still inplace.

<Content>Lovely Hotel just too far out of town As other people have said the hotel is fine but the location is too far out of Barcelona.The room and bathroom are very spacious and clean. Although we had trouble with the temperature as it was far too hot and you couldn't keep the window open because of the noise from the traffic.There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room.Food at the hotel is quite expensive and pretty average. Staff are friendly and helpful.If you arrive at Girona airport then get a Barcelona Bus to Estacio del Nord, a return ticket is 21 Euros. Then take Line 1 Redon the Metro from Arc de Triomf to Espanya and change to Line 3 Green to Maria Cristina or Palau Reial and then get a T3 or T2 Tram to St Marti de L'Erm. There is a supermarket at Can Clot.The T3 line is quicker. you can get a 4 day travel pass for the trams/metro/buses for 17.50 Euros.

<Content>O.K. With Some Problems Beautiful small hotel with a long ways to the sight seeing. Tours would not pick you at the hotel. Hotel was not even on sight seeing map. Hotel staff not very helpful with sight seeing directions. Must take tram into city. The tram was about 3 blocks from hotel. Then you had to take a subway the rest of the way to the sights or to pickup a tour. Food expensive in hotel. Hotel bed was hard. Rooms were very clean and decorated nicely. This is a business hotel not tourist hotel.

<Content>Ok hotel, in the outskirt of Barcelona Being a big fan of Hotwire/Priceline, I must say that they have deceived me this time, by saying Barcelona West I would never have thought that it would take me up to 1 hour to reach the center. The hotel is litterally next to the highway in an industrial zone, that could be anuwhere in this world, but not in....Barcelona; you really feel like you are missing out the whole action by staying that far. The transportation to the city center are really poor, you have to take a tram for around 25 minutes, which brings you to a tube station that is still not close to the center (around 10 stops to Las Rambla).The hotel itself is ok; the rooms are modern with lcd screen, but the bathroom looked a little bit tired, and one day the cleaning woman didnt bring us any shampoo/shower gel...We didnt stay lots of time in the hotel, so cant comment abotu the gym or restaurant, we took lots of taxis to go to Barcelona.If its your first time, try not to go that far and stay where the action is.

<Content>Good hotel a bit far from the action We have just returned from an 8 night stay at this hotel, booked via Priceline for 30 UK pounds per night. The hotel is a fine 4* establishment with large well-maintained, clean rooms, professional staff and a reasonably priced bar / cafe as well as a couple more upmarket restaurants.Good points:- The minibar in our room had plenty of space for us to store our own groceries; air conditioning was efficient and not noisy; comfortable, clean beds with regularly changed sheets; large bathroom with decent shower and toiletries; secure safe in the room.Couple of minor irritants: no tea or coffee making facilities in the room; took three requests to get an iron  ironing board delivered; very limited television channels - the only thing in English was Eurosport - and many of the other channels were unwatchable due to poor reception.Main drawback: distance to city centre. It's about 6 miles away from where most of the action is. However, the St Marti de l'Erm tram stop is a couple of minutes walk away, which gets you to Palau Reial in about 15 minutes and from there you can pick up the excellent Metro Line 3. Trams and Metros are easy to use and very good value. Also from Palau Reial you can get onto the Bus Turistic - a fantastic tourist bus service which was a brilliant way to get our bearings of the city in our first couple of days. The books of discount vouchers which came with the tickets, particularly 2 for the price of 1 at Port Aventura, more than recouped the price of the bus tickets.

<Content>Excellent value for money We stayed at the Hesperia and enjoyed our stay. The room was massive (it was advertised as a standard room) with a very big bed! The en-suite was lovely too. There was even a pillow menuWe did not find any noise problems with the hotel. The room has air-conditioning. There was traffic noise in the distance, but it was not loud and you expect some noise in a city!!!!! The staff were friendly and willing to offer advice and let us leave our bags with them on the last day prior to travel with no extra charges. The Hotel is quite far out. We knew this though on booking. There was a tram station about 200m from the hotel. You then needed to get off at Palau Reilal to go on the underground. YES it is a 40 minute journey, but if you want a really really nice Hotel and don't mind a little distance then this is a good place to be.

<Content>Good Hotel, Poor Location I got a good deal on this hotel from hotwire.com and we stayed there for 4 nights in June 06. Note that it is the only Hotwire 4 star in Barcelona West with a health club and no pool. This would probably be a fine place to stay the night before flying out of the Barcelona Airport. But getting to the La Ramble (Central Business district) is akward and takes 30 or 40 mins utilizing the tram and subway system. Subways are often very crowed and you might have to stand for most of the way. Additionally, there are no resturants or shops in the vicinity of the hotel which is situated in an industrial area of Sant Just. The rooms are large by European standards, and the room and bathroom was fairly clean. and modern. The carpet was however very dirty and stained, and this distracted from the room. The air worked great, and the bed was large and comfortable. The hotel staff spoke little English and it was difficult to communicate. I tried for 4 days to have a faulty shower valve fixed, and it was still bad when we checked out. If you have your own laptop, high speed internet access is free. There is a charge for using the hotel's computers. If this hotel were closer to La Ramba, I probably would have been quite happy, but in our case, the money saved didn't make up for the poor location.

<Content>Great Hotel We had a brilliant 4 days in Barcelona and stayed at the Hesperia. The room was immaculately clean and quiet and a lovely massive bed! Breakfast was excellent, although the hot food was cold but lots of fresh fruit, pastries, cereals, yoghurts etc. Although the hotel is away from the centre the tram is just over the road. You can buy a ticket from the tram stop. We bought a T10 ticket for 6 euros which gives you 10 journeys. We used just the one T10 ticket for the whole 4 days. If you take the T1 tram to the last stop this is one journey. You can also get off 2 stops before the terminus (i've forgotten the name!) and take the metro into the centre and, providing you do this in 75 minutes, still counts as one journey. The metro is just the same as the London Underground. When you get on the tram you put your ticket into the machine just inside the door and it validates it. There is also a display above the door which shows where you are on the line. If you take the tram to the end stop, head to Starbucks which is just to the right as you get off the tram, and the stop for the 'Bus Touristique' is just outside. I would advise getting a 2 day ticket which costs 22 euros but it takes you everywhere you need to go to see the sights of Barcelona. We returned to the hotel on the tram at about 10.30pm but I don't know what time they stop. Overall a lovely hotel and once you know what to do it is no hassle travelling into the centre. Lets your brekki settle on the way in and gives your feet a rest on the way back! I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Out of town We stayed 5 nights. The hotel was clean  we enjoyed using the gym (by ourselves). It is isolated and out of town. We rode the tram and the metro (very convienent) and just planned our days away from the hotel. On our last night, when we were toured out we went back to the hotel early  there is basically nothing to do at the hotel or in the area. We had to ride the tram to the mall for dinner.The robbery in the previous review is alarming. I was traveling with my daughter and we walked everywhere. There isn't alot of anything going on in the hotel area - so i can see why they were a target.

<Content>Beware!!!!!! Why the bad review when the hotel is clean, gym is nice and staff is courteous and helpful?Because we had the pleasure of being robbed in the hotel lobby on Saturday, March 18th, 2pm while we were checking in. Police report was filed at the airport. Ofcourse, one can't blame the hotel because three individuals who are not affiliated to the hotel, distracted a member of my party while another person stole his bag, ran out, and sped away in a getaway car. However, what the hotel and the Hisperia chain is guilty of is failure to install security cameras or hire a guard. There are no cameras anywhere in the hotel. Nor is there a security guard ever present. We have stayed in other hotels in Barcelona and there has always been security. What is more upsetting is the fact the General Manager of the hotel admitted to us that the same thing happened at the Novetel across the street. Therefore, management is aware of the problem but chooses to do nothing. Please be cautious on where you book and find out if hotel has security. It could make a difference.

<Content>Wonderful stay We had an overnight here before boarding a cruise ship. The hotel is beautiful and very clean. Food was excellent and staff very friendly. It's out of the city abit but that's what we wanted for this trip. Would definitely go back again.

<Content>Had a great stay. Suburban location not a problem. My wife and I had a wonderful stay at the Hesperia in early October, 2005 for four nites. Got a terrific price of $70 (US) on Hotwire. Then I learned the name of the hotel and read the reviews here and got a little nervous about the hotel location and the helpfulness of the staff. We had nothing to fear, as it turned out. There's a very cool tram only 300 yards away that connects with the Metro system. But more important, it also connects with the Red Route of the Bus Turistic. Buy the 2-day pass and ride both routes and it will take you everywhere you want to go, including back to the tram at the end of your long day of sight-seeing. It was the smartest thing we did in Barcelona. It takes maybe 15 minutes to get from the hotel to the Palu Reial connection point. And you can gawk along the way. The staff at the hotel were just fine. Helpful with tram directions, etc. No probs at all. We ate breakfast in the bar in the morning.... just coffee and a croissant...before starting out. Much cheaper than the 13 Euro buffet... which is a ton of money for b'fast. As for the hotel itself, it's a classy business hotel. Big room, big bath with lots of goodies, fine, comfy beds.Just plan your day so you can spend the day in town,, because it is too far out to commute back and forth. We had dinner in the hotel bar a couple of nites and it was just fine. Full of business people, but then that's the nature of the hotel and its location.  If you're looking for nite life, this is not the hotel and it's too far out to be useful to you. But for value, it's hard to beat, and we did not mind the commute into town at all.

<Content>Wonderful.....but far out! This is a really lovely hotel. Great facilities but further out than expected. Recommend travelling in by tram and buying a 'T-10' as you can use this ticket on all public transport which is also cheap and you can travel backwards and forwards all day for as long as you want. Be warned some websites advertise that this hotel has a jacuzi and swimming pool is doesn't! The hotel is really quiet too. Breakfast is good but don't get there at the last second as the hot food is cold! :)

<Content>Beautiful hotel but a bit far from the center I just stayed in this hotel July 8 after a road trip in southern France. I paid only 80 euros for the night and thought the hotel was a great price! When I arrived, there was a pianist playing jazz in the lobby/bar area (he was really good, by the way!) The lobby was really elegant and the front desk staff were really nice. Rooms were of 4* quality, nicely furnished with all kinds of toiletries in the marble bath. There was cable TV. There was also a mini refrigerator (but broken), so I couldn't stash my sodas in there. The majority of the guests seemed to be Americans.The only negative was the location. It's by a major highway and in an industrial type area. When I booked the hotel (through Easyclicktravel) the location said Barcelona, so I thought it was on the outskirts. It is actually in a suburb, Sant Just Deverns, about 10 minutes from the airport (if you don't get lost like I did-there are LOTS of turns!) Just make sure, if you have a rental car, that you get accurate directions from the internet before you leave. It will save you a lot of driving around. Parking was free directly in front of the hotel (or 8 euros for hotel parking).I would stay here again if I just needed one night and an easy place to park the car. If I were planning a longer stay, I would probably choose a hotel closer to the city to avoid wasting time going back and forth. The immediate area is kind of desolate looking. Overall, for me, a great stay!!

<Content>A valuable option in Barcelona... ... if you don't plan to have appointments. As you may read from other people, you will be at least 45 to 60 minutes (tram + underground) or 15 to 30 minutes (taxi) away from the city center. Our room (3rd floor) was well furnished, with free wi-fi internet access and had a spacious, spotless, bathroom. Breakfast was adequate in US grounds, but far better than in most 4+ european hotels. Overall experience was good, considering the low rate obtained by Hotwire. Think as a Sheraton or Marriot hotel in US, but located at the suburbs.
