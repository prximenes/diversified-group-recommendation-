<Content>Unexpectedly blown away by this little gem... After the fancy chic of Alila Ubud, I didn't really have high hopes for Alila Manggis which seemed like a poorer sister of sorts... But I was actually quite blown away by the tranquil ambience of relaxing beachside surroundings, the warm service of attentive but non-intrusive staff and the general congeniality in terms of the famous SeaSalt restaurant as well as the unspoilt countryside through we cycled through. But here are my short points that i wanted to share... Room -- I totally loved the room especially the two wide and spacious day-beds, one within the room so that we could mess around with our barang-barang and one in the balcony overlooking the pool, the expanse of coconut trees and the sea : ) The external day-bed was especially comfortable place to relax at anytime of the day -- while sipping camomile tea to slowly wake up from sweet dreams, while reading a good book to while away a rainy afternoon or even at night while talking to someone back home... I also liked the convenience that the wash area with the basin was separate from the shower area so that my friend and i could multi-task : ) I also liked the turn-down service and the aromatherapy amenities which helped us to relax.Service -- As mentioned above, I totally liked the service with staff that were pro-active and attentive without being intrusive. They were wonderful to chat with and they were warm in an engaging way! Our snorkelling guide was especially patient and attentive to our needs especially given that the currents were against us : (Pool -- Compared to Alila Ubud, this shallow pool was nothing to wax lyrical about but it was functional in a simple way and it is still a nice pool to lounge around : ) Restaurant -- I thought that the food was top-rated and I liked the blends of east and west that the executive chef had created. The breakfast sets were also very scrumptious although the asian dishes were slightly more appetising on my palate. A suggestion would be to offer the Rice Table as another option to the complimentary Balinese and Western meuns that we were offered. Further, perhaps they could increase the BBQ Seafood nights to more than merely Friday night?!? Suggestion -- To better their maps so that more guests could enjoy the walking and cycling trails -- the latter was especially interesting for us as we roamed about the village roads which were both safe and also inviting with cute village children calling out to us from their schools : )

<Content>We have been there once every year for the past 3 years, so..... So, I believe that most people will love it. I stayed at the Alila at Ubud as well but the service and food at Manggis is superior.Take your loved ones here for a holiday, they will thank you for it.Do not miss a meal at the Sea Salt (one of bali's best restarants), it can be expensive but don't be stingy. You can have cheaper meals at the nearby town of Candidasa (go to Vincent's or Fajar Candidasa or Puri Pandan) but the Sea Salt is a must try.Remember to book your spa sessions early, and ask for the seaside bales.We also enjoyed tea at their Organic Garden. I won't spoil the fun but trust me, it is well worth it....(here's a teaser: tea and snacks in a garden, next to padi fields with views of the sea)Also, the pool can be swarmed with sun lovers and can get icky with suntan oil but other than that, i usually just lounge on my day bed on my balcony and watch the world go by.As the property is next to the sea, don't book here if you feel seasick hearing the crashing waves. If you like the sound of the sea, go for it.Great for honeymoons and family getaways. I am a regular, you will be too.

<Content>Beware. Alila will bump you for more profitable bookings. Picture this...it's the first day of your honeymoon, you have just travelled 20+ hours and have arrived to check in to your hotel. You hand over the booking voucher, which has a confirmation for 5 nights, only to be told that your room will only be available for 2 nights. The initial message from the hotel was that there was no confirmation sent, and no record of the booking. When I pointed out that I had all booking numbers (sent to our travel agent by the hotel!) and confirmation receipts, one of the members of staff let slip that they had a wedding party in the next day. This was something the hotel obviously knew about, and could have told us months before. This could have allowed us to amend our plans with ease. Unfortunately, because they decided to stick their heads in the sand and hope for the best, we had to change our holiday plans at the last minute, and quite frankly I was disgusted.I think a hotel which manages to reduce a newlywed bride to tears on her first night of honeymoon deserves to be named and shamed.If you decide to go to Alila be aware of these things:The rooms are small and not very private.The beach is black volcanic rock.The food is pretty good, but overpriced as you are a bit of a captive audience.The management will become mysteriously scarce if there is a problem, leaving unfortunate local employees to cope.Bali is a wonderful country. We visited the Chedi Club, and Four Seasons. Both are absolutely fantastic (especially Chedi). So please dont be too put off!

<Content>Pros and Cons I stayed at the hotel close to a month ago and for the most part enjoyed it. I went alone, and as a single female, never for a moment felt unsafe-- which is really important to know. I thought that the ride from the airport to the hotel was very comfortable (offered water and pillows and an ipod and the scented face towels were great) but then those same considerations were not available on the ride back to the airport, even though you pay the same amount. The hotel grounds are lovely, the pool is excellent. But there is no beach! I read other posts and thought that maybe I could walk to a sandy beach, but it's not very safe. It's basically ocean with waves, stones, then a concrete wall. So if you are a huge lover of the beach experience, this is not the place for you. The hotel rooms are comfortable, particularly for the price. There aren't many channels on the television, but then you're supposed to enjoy the view right? The restaurant is overpriced and is adequate... it's in a lovely setting, but the food is just okay. There were items that were great, but for the most part I wasn't impressed (particularly with the price). The staff does seem to want to push you into joining the hotel activities. One activity I highly recommend, the snorkeling. It was fantastic! One activity I highly discourage, the trips into the choice of two villages. I went on the free trip to the oldest village in Bali and is the only one with double ikat weaving and it was 2 hours long and it was about an hour and a half too long! Also, the driver took me to a particular weaving shop and I felt pressured to buy from that particular shop. But I didn't after being told that one little scarf is $60 US. Also, the hotel doesn't mention it in the trip description, but you are expected to donate to the village before entering (not much, just a couple bucks). It's really a waste of time and I felt that I constantly had to turn down entreaties to buy items. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and would go back if the price was right. It's definitely not perfect, but then there can't be much complaining when you are in Bali!

<Content>So-so experience, in comparison to the other Alila at Ubud This review is written, with references, to my other review on Alila Ubud. My wife and I took the 2 faces of Alila at Bali for our honeymoon in Jan 2008 - 2 nites at Ubud, 2 at Manggis. Because of the wonderful experience at Ubud, the staff at Manggis is less attentive, slower and less willing to accommodate to our requests. For example, there were only 2 bottles of complimentary water in the room upon arrival and when we asked for 4 more, the reception staff sounded surprise. 4 more?! - exact quotation with a tone of exclamation. And that was our first call to reception for additional water... Well, Bali is a tropical and hot island that averages 30 degrees Celsius, yeah?!Location-wise, Manggis (in East Bali) is an hour and a half drive from Ubud (central part of the island where many interesting rice fields and temples are located) , and a good 2 hours' drive from the famous, touristy part of Kuta. There is absolutely no beach at Alila Manggis. So forget about beach activities. There is even a sign that reads Dangerous. Of course, there is a swimming pool, but I won't say it is attractive, with limited number of deckchairs. Because of the wayward location in Manggis, we hired a guide to take us around. The one offered by the hotel is more expensive than one we found when shopping around in Ubud a few days earlier - by ~USD30 and not very flexible with the timing. We were quite pleased with the one we found, who not only drove us around but doubled up as a guide. In the end, we tipped our driver/guide by the difference in the amount quoted by the hotel. There are plus points though for the resort in Manggis. The breakfast, while not buffet, has enough selection on the menu for small 'breakfast eaters' like us. The quiet location means very private experience with your spouse/partner. There are frequenty tai-chi and yoga sessions in the mornings or late afternoons for that wholesome, relaxing experience.One advice though. If you decide to take the 2 faces of Alila package, which I still believe is a worthwhile deal, start off with Alila Manggis. That way, the experience will only get better! =P

<Content>DISAPPOINTED I stayed in the regular room on the first floor and the room itself was very disappointing: small, with people passing by your glass door all the time, so you have to be fully dressed when in the room or can close the glass with a wooden sliding door, which makes you feel inside like in a cage without any day light. The shower is 3 star hotel level. There is no sink in the shower, so in the morning you have to dress up and then you can use the sink in the room, otherwise it is too dark with the closed door. Internet was working from time to time, usually around 7-8am in the morning you would have a chance, but in the evening time with all the traffic it was a way too slow even to open e-mails. Pool was nice, but on average, there are 10 children playing in the water, so there is no way you can do laps. Food was good in the restaurant, but they charge EUR 4 for a small (375cl) bottle of local water! The rest of the menu is priced accordingly. The overall impression is that the are trying to be a design hotel, but as cheap as possible and overcharging the guests for everything.

<Content>Disappointing Disappointing. Small rooms, mediocre, overpriced food - breakfast the same every morning (cinnamon muffins get boring day after day) and buffet food not covered so breakfast for the flies as well. Staff meant well but there seemed to be no effort spared to separate you from your money.

<Content>Nice, quiet hotel Realised that this is a way overdue review as I stayed there a year ago!Opted for the Alila Two Ways package where you are offered 2 nights at Manggis and another 2 nights at Ubud. Airport transfers are part of the package and relatively painless. Our welcome was very nice and warm. The room is laid out in a modern decor. It was very clean and very spacious. There was a nice balcony with a day bed where one could spend many hours just chilling and reading a book. It had a great view of the pool and the beach. We had dinner at the edge of the property, really close to the sea, it was a magnificent experience in the evening with the tiki torches.Only downside for the hotel is its location. It's quite far away from everything. There is a town nearby where you can get cheap massages and there are quite a few decent restaurants there as well. I can't recall if the shuttle was complimentary or not though.Definitely go backable if one's looking for a chill-out and restful vacation.

<Content>This hotel was garbage I was so disappointed with this hotel. It was horrible. From the moment we arrived employees were halking us to take us to buy things for which they would get kickbacks - totally inappropriate. THey even tried to sell you shampoo from your bathroom! The restaurant, which is advertised as great, was completely mediocre, and the service was sub-par - served by dirty and inattentive servers. Perhaps I was spoiled by all of the other great hotels I stayed at during my trip, but this hotel definitely was the worst, by far, and it was not cheap. The grounds were not well kept, it was noisy, with tourists lounging about everywhere - no privacy. Just gross. Do not stay here, you can do much better. Plus, not too much to do in candidasa. Take my advice and SKIP IT. A real bummer on an otherwise great trip.

<Content>Top Hotel Just Beware of Booking through Magic of the Orient We stayed at the Alila Manggis and really enjoyed ourselves. The location was stunning- right in front of a breaking reef, the staff were fantastically accomodating and friendly, the food was all fresh and healthy and they organise plenty of activities if you want to drag yourself away from the pool.Our only dissapointment was with our tour opperator, Magic of the Orient, who misrepresented what was included and tried to sneak in extra charges each step of the way once we were out there. Far from taking the hassel out of organising the trip they compicated it unnecessarily.Would definately recommend staying at the Alila Manggis, just save yourself some grief and use a decent tour operator.

<Content>Very different, great food (Chef) and staff Alila Manggis does all the small things you miss at other hotels. Very helpful and personal service, home made cookies when they turn down your room, good quality bikes for hire, free afternoon tea/coffee with sweets at the pool side, a la carte breakfast and so on ....Unfortunatley there is no beach, but for a short stay that really doesn't matter.The food is great, so is the cooking school, but the price level for the food is too high.

<Content>Interesting hotel, but with downsides This resort had been highly recommended by a couple of small tour operators but at first sight we were terribly disappointed. We had come from a villa hotel with private pool and the room at the Chedi was very small with tiny bathroom. The hotel has no beach so all sunbeds were in lines around the pool. That was all such a disappointment and so much so that we arranged to cut our stay from 5 nights to 4. However, after night we soon realised the charm of the place. The staff all went out of their way to have a chat with us and particularly to tell us about the East coast and the lifestyle there. The exec chef is new, was trained at the Savoy and is excellent. She was very keen to get feedback. There are lots of little surprises such as afternoon tea, excellent turn down service with hand made biscuits and a great spa with treatments that used products made locally and smelt good enough to eat. There was also a long list of possible trips, most of which were eco type and supported the local community. We went into Padang Bai during the days for diving, but I think we might have been a bit bored staying by the pool all day - grounds are gorgeous but small so no walking around and no long beach. Food and drink wise, the hotel was expensive - it was on a par with the deluxe Oberoi Lombok where we went to afterwards.Would we go back? Well, despite cutting out stay short, yes. Again, we would go for no more than four nights unless we could get a suite. However, we would have to book early as there are only two suites so these are popular. We certainly could not get one when we tried to upgrade.

<Content>The resort with personality, simpicity and charm Just got back from Bali June 20. Stayed at Alila Manggis and felt compel to drop a note on our stay. I heard much of this resort to invest time and money for my wife's birthday. I did not regret. I stayed in both Manggis and Ubud and had noted reviews that Manggis is the lesser of the two. I viewed this very differently. Here is what impresses me:OverallGreat setting next to the sea. Clean, well trimmed and neat lines (even the coconut trees are lined up!). While there are greens all around, its constantly been maintained. I saw workers trimming the plants and tendering the pond almost all day! Its quiet setting is only disrupted by the waves crashing onto the water breaker. It as literacy stated not a beach resort. So do not expect one.AccomodationI felt it is simple and modern. Its not rustic resorts that captured hearts nor urbanized rooms you find in business hotels yet it have enough to create its own charm. Surprising since this resort had been here for 13 years. Its very well kept. We stayed in the deluxe rooms which had a day bed in the balcony which is the center piece and we made full used of. Great for the afternoon teas for two. Room are of good size and is comfortable. Bathrooms are tuck behind. Good running hot and cold water with no complains there.StaffThe one thing that separate Alila Manggis and Ubud is likely the staff. Not to be mistaken that of lower and less friendly service. The staff at Manggis is more forthcoming and more aware of guest needs, willing to offer options and listens. As an example both the GM and Executive Chef are readily available and mingle with guest to listen, understand and work with to make their stay so much more meaningful. I do not get this in larger hotels. Another example, the front desk will tried calling to see the time to arrange our transfer the next day to minimize wait time. When we are not reachable, the front desk will not called after 8pm fearing that we may had called it a night. Yet when we checkout the next day the vehicle quickly available anticipating our time we will leave. While the GM was not there as in a couple of send offs I saw, there are a few staff that see us to the car and says their goodbyes.Restaurant and FoodAn open restaurant that maximize the view of the sea. Seasalt is rated the top five restaurant in Bail. Judging from the two breakfast and one teabreak, the rating is not wrong. Its unfortunate our only dinner did not impress me as much as I would expected. Do not get me wrong, its good. Just that for the price, the hype that it was a special event and the executive chef personally comes to the pool in the afternoon to introduce the event that I would expect more for the dinner besides RIJSTTAFEL. This was not stated clearly in the dinner menu listed. I guess its likely many guests may not know or hear of RIJSTTAFEL to begin with. Given the single plate dinner it does not leave time for dinner conversations.Little SurprisesManggis offers complimentary afternoon tea and local titbits from 3pm to 5pm. And a cocktail at 6pm first drink complimentary of course. For those that wanted more personal touch, the resort is willing to setup special breakfast or dinner with rice field sunrise/sunset or romatic themes. While I did not take advantage of this in Manggis and one of my only regret. I did that in Ubud. For US$100 for couple it is worth every penny!

<Content>The lesser of the two faces My partner and I just finished a 10 day trip in Bali with 5 of those spent with Alila. Taking advantage of their 2 faces package we followed our stay at Ubid with Manggis. Comparatively the Manggis location is inferior for its design, serenity (close to a main road), food and accommodations. Manggis recently hired a new chef from Australia who may be able to pull things together. She has already started an on site organic herb garden to supplement the hotel's larger O-gradens off site. All around the hotel is very committed to the environment which is refreshing. The accommodations are dated and the beach is separated from the property with a large stone retaining wall making the pool more of a hangout than the beach. As with the Ubid location the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable regarding activities both on and off the property. My recommendation for non-divers looking for a moderately priced accommodation for relaxation and to pretend like your enjoying a 5 star hotel would be to stay at the Ubid location. However, everything at the Ubid location is slightly more expensive. We are already planning on returning to Alila Ubid but will most likely skip Manggis.

<Content>just ok Stayed for four nights in March. Considering all the great hotels in Bali this one is mediocre at best. Architecture of buildings that house rooms look more like ski condos than Bali inspired structures. Bathrooms are old and tired. Pool is nice but beach is really not visable from property. Was some horrible smell either from rotting plants or dirty fish ponds wafting through walk way to room and sometimes on room balcony. Food is average and service although they try hard it seemed difficult for them to get orders correct. The spa is small and uninspired. In general there are much nicer places to stay in Bali.

<Content>Lovely hotel but not quite 5 star I am in the luxury hotel business in Europe. Alila Hotels web site projects a very high image which makes you think it is going to be of a 5 star quality. The Alila Manggis was built by the same hotel group as the Datai in Langkawi where we stayed some years back so we were expecting a very good hotel.I will say the same as for Alila Ubud which is that this hotel is good value for money. It is not 5 star quality but then the price is under 200 dollars a night compared to over 600 dollars for some other hotels on Bali. You get a lot of hotel for the money but some areas of service sometimes do not come up to expectations - not the friendliness or willingess of the staff but I believe the training.We stayed at this hotel in October 2006 for one week, in a deluxe room. The week before we had stayed at the Alila Ubud.Great position right on the sea although unfortunately someone told us, they lost the beach 20 year ago due to companies mining the offshore coral reef for building materials. Still there are great views down (what is left of) the beach and lovely views across to the islands.We loved the architecture and layout of this hotel although like Ubud it is showing signs of its age and needs some renovation work. There were signs that this was happening as some re-roofing and varnishing was taking place. The pool area is great with plenty of space. One strange problem was that the pool was so hot - like a warm bath which was not very inviting.Deluxe rooms nice and housekeeping excellent. Bathroom a little small and old fashioned these days but a manager said they were going to upgrade them soon. Lovely balcony overlooking pool and gardens.Really good food although quite expensive in relation to the price of the hotel. There are local alternatives which involve a (free) shuttle bus and these are conveniently timed for eating out in the local town. Recommend Vincents Restaurant in Candidassa.Service was always friendly and helpful although we found breakfast service a bit erratic. I have said this about Ubud but the staff seem to spend an awful ammount of time talking to the guests which as well as getting a bit much at times, has an effect on service as no one is doing anything!Service seems to be a strange affair at Alila Hotels as it can be so good and then it can drop which leaves you with a feeling of dissapointment. A good example would be that late in the afternoon, no one at reception or even the concierge would know what activities were taking place the next day and would tell us we had to wait for housekeeping to deliver the postcard with the information in the evening. This seems an odd way to run a hotel and it even happened that after that, some of the listed activities were then not available.It is true though, that all the staff were unstinting in their wish to provide good service and be as helpful as possible. A bit more training and better communication from the management could sort these problems out in no time.All in all a great stay and would definitely go again.

<Content>Wonderful! We had a fantastic stay here last month. Eastern Bali is wonderfully removed from the main tourist path, but the Alilla is an oasis within it. Everything was great from the moment we checked in. This is the kind of place that is small enough everyone greets you by name, but large enough you can be completely left alone if you'd like. The staff were excellent--so friendly, so knowledgeable, so helpful.We stayed four nights, and two of them the hotel had 'social' events that evening: a traditional Balinese dance and cook-out one night, and free cocktails and canapes the other. This is actually the type of hotel where we wanted to get to know the other guests--had a lot of fun meeting some great people from all over the world. The crowd was very diverse--generally young (30-45yo) couples from all over the world. We, as a gay couple, felt very comfortable--and there were several others during our stay as well.My only nitpick would be that the restaurant is a bit pricey, and there aren't too many local alternatives. Breakfast (included in our room) was fantastic, as were all the meals.After the Alila we stayed in Ubud (although not the Alila Ubud), which was a great way to see another part of the island. What really makes a trip to Bali such a stand-out is the natural warmth and hospitality of the people. Go, stay at Alila, and have a blast.

<Content>Fabulous!!!! What a retreat!!We stayed there (far too short) during our first trip to Bali and enjoyed the Alila Experience (both Alila Ubud and Alila Manggis)Welcome was superb. Extensive explanation about the package. Mountainbiketour, Romance by the beach, Snorkeling; everything was superb. Food is excellent but especially the personalised service stroke us as excellent for this level.One just has to book the suite (no. 222) Rooms look OK, but this suite was very nice indeed.All in all a very good value for money proposition.

<Content>Can't wait to come back. We decided to stay here after staying in their sister hotel, the Alila Ubud. We weren't disappointed. This is a beautiful hotel on the coast, but the beach is unspectacular so it is not marketed as a beach hotel. The pool however is beautiful, as is the rest of the hotel with distinctive Balinese archtiecture with a modern twist.The staff as just lovely and very helpful. The food and service in the restaurant was very good. There are lots of things to do with trips being arranged through the hotel, or you can arrange a snorkelling trip with one of the local men who magically appear on the beach selling pearls or the ubiquituous copy watches.This is a lovely place to relax and we will definitely go out of our way to return here.
