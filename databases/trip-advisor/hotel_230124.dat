<Content>Clean, comfortable hotel The location is great, easily reachable with tram services in the city. The hotel is also within a walking distance to Tropenmuseum which I thought is worth visiting to again!Hotel room is moderate size, not too tiny. Very clean and I like the color scheme they use to decorate the room. The furnishings are not heavy. They have special pillow and mattress - gave me good night sleep. Breakfast was not included in our one night stay so can't really comment on that. They also provide temporary lockers if you want to check out early but want to leave your luggage for a few hours til the afternoon.Overall, very satisfying stay at this hotel - we'll go there again.

<Content>Quite a disappointment I thought I knew that all NH Hotels were actually very nice and comfortable hotels, so when I booked NH Tropen, I thought it was going to be excellent 鈥?and the home page did very little to change that (not surprisingly).However, I was quite disappointed when I arrived. The reception staff was friendly enough and check-in was easy. It did occur to me, that it did not look rather worn when entering, and this was only to be confirmed.The room was quite small (and judging from the emergency exit chart on the door, they all were on my floor), and it was rather gloomy due to the heavy use of brown colours and not much lighting. It was also very cold, and it took me some time to find out that there was a hole underneight the TV set where I could reach into a thermostat and turn on some heating. A colleague staying in another room also met a very cold room. The heating was effecient but such a cold room is just not very welcoming.My room had twin beds which were not large but rather comfortable. Unlike most other hotel chains, NH actually offers a pillow menu, giving you a choice of a number of different types of pillows. That is a nice feature, but even the standard ones were fine.The room had seperate WC and bathrooms, both very small. As a male, you would almost have to make up your mind on your use of the WC before entering to ensure that you entered the room the right way round. There did not appear to be any heating in the WC, so there was no hanging around there reading the newspaper. Bathroom was also rather small with a tiny shower niche. Not much water pressure in the shower, and the fittings were generally rather worn, but otherwise it was OK. Apart from all the regular items found in hotel bathrooms, they also had extras like a sponge, dental kit, and a comb. For regular visitors they even offered to keep your gels and liquids (like shaving gel) so that you would not have to worry about that at the airport if you were a hand baggage only traveller. That is actually quite a good idea, if you have the need.One rather weird thing was that the cupboard was located inside the bathroom.The TV set offered a selection of Dutch TV channels plus a few international ones, including BBC 1  2, but not a major news channel like BBC World, Sky News, or CNN. But in fact, rather than watching TV, you might simply want to enjoy the view. I was on the 9th floor, and the view from there was fantastic.Surprisingly, even on the 9th floor there was quite a lot of traffic noise from down below. Some of this noise would come from the trams, with tram line 9 operating just outside the hotel, taking you straight into the centre of Amsterdam, including to the central station and Rembrandtplein. Connexion shuttle buses are operated to and from the airport, so if you are travelling by public transport, the place is conveniently located. Parking is available, though at an extra price, and they only have a few spaces.Finally, I would say that I was quite disappointed that everything was extra and at a high cost. With rather limited parking, a charge for this is fair enough, but 鈧?7 for an incredibly dull breakfast is a rip-off. Instead of having your breakfast at the hotel, find a cafe or similar somewhere else 鈥?it is likely to be both cheaper and better. Internet access was also an extra, offered by Swisscom at a rate of 鈧?0 for one our or 鈧?7 for 24 hours. With many other hotels offering this service for free, this is really appalling.

<Content>Good Value, Good Location Recently stayed in NH Tropen for 4 nights. Would recommend this hotel as a good-value and convenient place to stay in Amsterdam. Hotel is right on the No. 9 Tram direct to Central Station via Dam Square. Also very close to No 10 to Leidesplein and the musuem area and No.14 to near the Anne Frank House. Room was perfectly fine with a good bed, nice toiletries, etc. Hotel is situated in a pleasant area, not right in the centre of things or on the prettiest canal, but since all these are very near by tram, thats no problem.Amsterdam is a compact city so it's very easy to get around by the excellent public transport - suggest buying the 24, 36, 72 or 96-hour transport ticket (only 鈧?6.50 for 4 days unlimited tram, bus, night bus and metro services!).Staff were pleasant and helpful. Didn't sample the breakfast which at 鈧?7 sounds a bit pricey but with a room only rate of 鈧?0 you should go out and eat in one of the excellent Amsterdam cafes - don't miss the 1st Klas Cafe in Central Station (Platform 2b) if you have time.

<Content>Everything fine until they kicked us out... 24 hours after we learned that our daughter was in the ICU my husband and I were en route to Amsterdam. Her husband was flying in from Tokyo. We didn't have time to book a hotel before traveling to the Netherlands. After checking on our daughter's status, we walked in to the NH-Tropen Hotel which was close to the hospital. We were told we could have two rooms (one for my husband and me and one for my son-in-law), for 4 nights, June 10, 11, 12, 13. We said we would take them. Twice we asked about extending the stay but were told that they might only be able to give us one room. We should check in the morning to be sure. It didn't sound like they were going to have room so we made other arrangements for the nights of the 14th and 15th. When we returned to the hotel the night of the 13th we were told that we were supposed to have checked out that morning. What was our reservation verification number? We explained that we had walked in on Sunday and didn't have an advance reservation. At 11pm we were handed our bags which had been packed by the hotel staff. The young woman at the desk was obviously annoyed that her manager had placed her in such a difficult position but she never offered to help us find another hotel. Fortunately, we were able to contact the hotel we had planned to move to the next day. They took us in. The taxi driver said we were the second people who had been kicked out of the hotel that day. Obviously the hotel was over-booked. What a shabby way to treat clients. They also charged us more for the rooms than we had been told when we checked in. Unfortunately, we didn't have anything in writing to show them what we had been told. Next time we'll know!

<Content>Great for price After reading some of the other comments I was very pleasantly surprised. Yes it is a bit away from the main area of the city but no more than a 10 min tram trip which costs only 1.60 euro and lasts about 2 hours if you want to hop back onto the tram.We walked the first day to get into town but after a while it does get tiring.Trams stop after midnight.The rooms were to my mind (especially after moving to Britain a few years ago from Oz and now used to sleeping in broom closets) very spacious for europe.I liked the idea of separate doors for toilet and shower too.The front desk was efficient and polite and I found the bar staff very friendly although the drinks a little overpriced.The beds were extremely comfortable but I have to admit the room was hot the night I stayed. As it is possible to climb through the window onto the balcony and walk into someone elses room I don't think people would be comfortable with that. I just locked all my items into the in room safe and I was happy to leave the window open.If I could not get a good deal at a closer hotel I would definitely consider staying here again.

<Content>OK, not exceptional First things first. I was working for a company who made all the hotel arrangements, so I have no idea what the room cost or even what level room I had, but I think I was in a standard room which was on the 7th floor.This hotel was a very mixed bag for me. They get the big things right, but the small things are terribly wrong. The hotel is located a bit off the street and can be a bit hard to find the first time, but it is directly behind the tram stop on the right side of the street if you're leaving the city center. After entering the hotel property through a very strange gate in a fence with barbed wire on top you enter into a very calming courtyard and then into the lobby which is fairly attractively decorated in a modern fashion. The bar/restaurant is at the back overlooking Oosterpark, the breakfast room to one side (also with windows on the park) and the front desk is located right across for the lifts, allowing the staff to keep an eye on things.Security was OK (despite the strange balcony mentioned in previous reviews) and you need your room key to get into the lifts.Checkin was very easy as I was all prebooked and they just handed me my keycard. I don't know what other experiences would be.The room was indeed small, but fairly nicely laid out with an adequate bed that was very firm, two side tables, a desk with chair, one additional side chair, and a nice wardrobe. The bath was small and with only a shower, but was adequate.One problem was that the towels were not replenished in any regular fashion and the number and size of towels varied from day to day. The ammenties were never replenished and the very small glycerine soaps melted away in about a minute. Other problems. My wakeup call never came, although by that time I had discovered that the TV had an easy to use alarm which sufficed. I reported that my door was broken and that I had to slam it to get it closed. It was never repaired, despite a promise to do so. The elevator lobby on my floor had two ceramic vases on a table, one of which was broken. Other minor problems were also present, but nothing extraordinary. They just all combined to give me the impression of a hotel that wasn't trying very hard.Breakfast was OK, but I wasn't paying as it was included with my room. The usual coffee, meats, cheeses, cereal, fruit, etc. but also cooked eggs sausage and bacon. I was worried about the location, but it was actually fine. The number 9 tram does stop right outside and runs frequently throughout the daytime but stops at about midnight. I actually walked into the city center several times, a very safe 30 minute walk, and easy to do. I actually walked back at 2:00 am one morning and I had no problems whatsoever as there were several other people out on the street as well. The area is a bit sketchy but OK. There is a weekend street market down the street and a few shops that aren't terribly interesting. Several restaurants and bars are close by and there is also a coffee shop if that sort of thing interests you. The park is nice for a morning walk or run but does get odd at night. If you stray too far you will very possibly find yourself in an immigrant area which seemed safe but not the normal Amsterdam.All in all, a decent stay but there are certainly better choices closer to the middle of town.It would be fairly easy to get to if you are driving, since it is located right on a main road that connects directly to the ring road and you don't need to drive anywhere near the center of town.

<Content>Nice Hotel, but... Stayed at NH Tropen for four nights in June. Overall it's a very nice hotel, comfortable room ( stayed in the 8th floor with a nice city and Tropen Museum view ) and great beds. The only problem was that we caught some days with 28, 29 degrees and the room didn鈥檛 had air conditioning ( ! ). Also, there is one only balcony surrounding all the building in every stage, which makes an easy access from a room to another if anyone would want to, so we didn鈥檛 even risk sleeping with the window open. It鈥檚 a little strange why they don鈥檛 just create individual balconies separating it for each room. That should be so easy to do! I understand that usually Amsterdam it鈥檚 not a typical hot weather city, but even so鈥?it's a pity such a nice hotel to fail in this area. So it was a bit difficult to get a good night sleep, what was a real shame in a comfortable room and bed.The staff was great, always answering our questions about the city and giving us directions.The hotel is a little bit off the centre but the tram stops right in front of it, so it turns out to be easy to reach the main sites. The only problem with this location is that the last tram runs at about midnight ( hey Amsterdam ! get more night friendly ! ) so if you want to stay downtown a little longer you have to catch a taxi to get back to the hotel.We loved Amsterdam. It鈥檚 a very lovely city, especially the area along the Herengracht, Singel and Prisengracht canals. Go to Seven Bridges and enjoy the beautiful and romantic ambiance. Would recommend this hotel, but out of the hot days of summer, or鈥?check out in detail the weather report before you go!

<Content>Good Service The hotel itself is about 30 mins walk to Dam square, however the no.9 tram you can catch right outside the hotel will take you there.The hotel was very clean and art deco in the rooms. The hotel staff were very friendly and made us feel very welcome, even at 5am when we was just getting in.

<Content>Good option This is a really nice place for the $. I have stayed in several areas of the city and this is not bad at all. The tram is pretty quick and the taxis at night get you back easily. Just make sure you have pocket change. If you have a car, the parking lot is pretty secure. the area is very quiet at night. I would definitely stay here again. The remodeled interior is also nice. Bathroom was tremendous.

<Content>Tiny rooms but good service The location is one issure I have with this hotel. It is unwalkable from here to the center. You can take the 7 or 9 tram (9 from Grand Centraal) and it takes about 20-30 minutes. There is good and bad in this. It is located by Oosterpark, which is beautiful with a pond and ducks. We had a few very relaxing picnic lunches there. However, do not go to this park at night as the contingent changes drastically from regular people enjoying nature to young punks giving you dirty looks. The metro in Amsterdam is almost useless and you need to take the tram or bus (bus especially at night) to get anywhere if you are not centrally located. But in 2 days, we learned how to walk there and back and our last night we had no problems with taking a 2-hour walk around 3am back to the hotel from the center. The rooms are tiny and we had a double. The views of the park and city are cool, but seriously - the rooms are very cramped. The food is crazy overpriced - 13 euros for breakfast? I don't think so. But the service is excellent. The front desk is very courteous and attentive. By the way a cab to Schipol airport from here is 45 euros and takes around 20 minutes. We were almost late for our morning flight on the last night (fell asleep) but they checked us out very quickly and called the cab which was there in 5 minutes. We paid around $120 per night for this room. The only comparably-priced hotels near the center are dumps in or around the Red Light District which I wouldn't stay at ever. It sounds nice whehn you're booking but you are very dissapointed when you get there. We are all in our early 20's but none would stay there. This is a good compromise if you are fine with walking. Amsterdam is not hard to navigate: just follow the canal.

<Content>great breakfasts! stayed at this hotel for three nights in december 2005. have been to Amsterdam twice before, this was the furthest out of the city centre we`d stayed. good, quiet location away from the bustle of the city centre. tram stop is right outside the hotel, and only 10 minutes ride into town, with a frequent service. modern, quiet hotel, rooms at the back of the hotel overlook the Oosterpark, and if you`re up high enough, you get a fantastic view. clean, contemporary decor, very helpful informative staff. breakfast was 10 euros when we went, but it`s buffet style, and something for everyone served in a bright airy restaurant. we really pigged out, and worked our way through all the dishes, even the apple tart. local shopping area close by with plenty of supermarkets. i would stay here again

<Content>Nice hotel I and two others recently stayed at the NH Tropen. The room for 3 people was a bit small but rather nice. Warning: the floors are really nice but not carpeted, so waking up and taking a shower with a cold floor is not so pleasant. We had a corner room overlooking the park. The staff was inviting, warm, and friendly. Breakfast, though not included, was very nice. Fresh bread, croissants, fruit, cereals, juices, coffee, tea, water, milk, yogurt every morning, even well-stocked at the breakfast's ending time. Tram 9 will take you from Centraal Station to Mauritskade, the hotel's stop. Right next door is the Tropen Museum, which is interesting if you like anthropology. I would definitely stay at this hotel and recommend it to all.

<Content>Unsafe, avoid at all costs - 5 rooms robbed in one night! I stayed with 5 friends at the NH Tropen during the last weekend of October. The night that we arrived, we went out in the evening and returned several hours later to find that all of our 3 rooms had been broken into and over 2,000 鈧?(that's over $3,400) had been stolen from us. The objects missing included passports, cash, cell phones, jewelry, digital cameras, etc. However, even more terrifying than being robbed in a foreign country was the management's reaction. At NH Tropen, apparently the customer is never right. The manager appeared unworried that five - yes, 5! - rooms had been burglarized in his hotel in one night, although he claimed it was the first time this took place. He refused to admit that it was the hotel's lack of security that caused this to happen (though security looks tight at the entrance, all the rooms on each floor in the back are joined by a balcony ledge. Anyone jumping on the fire escape ladder can easily gain access to any room, which they did by breaking the window locks.) He refused to reimburse us for our loss and did not treat us with even minimal respect, saying at least once this is not my problem and tried to push us into a wild goose chase with his insurance which we found out later does not even cover this kind of loss. Everyone we spoke to - NH customer service personnel, the hotel's own insurance - confirmed that we could only get reimbursed from the hotel itself - something the manager flatly denied. In the end, he not only refused to continue talking calmly to us but grew angry, interrupted us, and threatened to call the police if we did not leave the premises. This less than 24 hours after we were robbed in his own hotel! We are seriously looking into the possibility of legal action to get reimbursed, though nothing can make up for the frayed nerves, ruined vacation, and insulting behavior that we suffered that weekend. So, choose another hotel unless you enjoy spending vacations in police stations!

<Content>Comfortable, quiet, convenient Stayed a few days in October 2004. I'm guessing that the hotel has been renovated/updated since the 2003 review was written. Linens, furniture and facilities seemed quite new and comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful. Finally, although I haven't stayed in other places in Amsterdam (my first trip here), I think the hotel is a great value for the money.

<Content>excellent location and good service! Stayed at NH Tropen last weekend (Sep 18, 2004) and enjoyed it very much. Location is excellent. You can walk in 15 minuted to the Rembrandtsplein and the Artis Zoo is just around the corner. Rooms are nice and new (ask for the renovated rooms!) and on the top floors you have a nice view over Amsterdam. Staff is very friendly and breakfastbuffet is plenty (including apple-pie!)You can park at a small fee on the save parkinglot of the hotel.

<Content>We enjoyed the Tropen's peace and quiet We stayed at the NH Tropen (the Tulip Inn is not included in the present name) on Linneausstraat in late May 2004. While the place is not fancy, it is very pleasant and quiet. We found it a good spot to recover from the jet lag of a long trip from Australia and equally good for accessing all parts of Amsterdam. The staff were friendly and helpful. Email was easy. The movie system doesn't work. The breakfast, at 13 euros per person, filled us up and let us have a snack lunch and a late dinner. Coffee, tea, interesting breads, sausage, bacon, eggs, cheeses, croissants, rolls, apple tart, and butter that actually tasted good. We didn't eat dinner there -- few choices and too smokey. The inn is very near the tram which will take you to downtown, to central station, and other points in the city very easily. Also, there is a pleasant park next to the hotel for walking or jogging, and many walk-able cafes, restaurants, and bakeries nearby, as well as ATMs, grocery stores, etc. There is a washer, dryer and iron available to guests. Connexxion bus service to/from the airport are much cheaper than a taxi and comes right to the hotel. Non-functioning movies and the occasionally smokey lobby and bar/restaurant were the only down sides to this hotel from our point of view. Central Amsterdam is very packed and busy -- if you want that, don't stay at the Tropen. If you want a bit of peace and quiet with easy access to downtown by a 10-minute tram ride (or 20 minute walk), the Tropen is great.

<Content>Liked the Tulip Inn Tropen The Tupip in is not centrally located but that can be a good thing. Plenty of whole in the wall places nearby. There is a tram practically outside the front door not to mention the taxi stand just as close.The staff is great. I recommend the top floor for the views.

<Content>Uncomfortable Stay The NH Tropen is not centrally located but easily accessible by tram, which is located in front of the hotel. Although expedia gives this place a high rating, the carpet and linens, which have not been replaced in quite some time, makes it an uncomfortable place to stay. Especially during the warmer months, where the lack of air conditioning, lack of screens, etc. let in mosquitoes and loud noises from Oosterpark. I do not recommend staying here.
