<Content>Won't be my first choice next time I booked a room for a family member for a stop over stay. The stay in total was going to be for 6 hours. I made the reservations through starwood and I contacted the hotel directly to make sure that they will accept my credit card for payment. I was sent the authorization form and on it was a place to put down what I believe the charge on the mastercard will be. I had also requested an early check in, which is normally a request that is not guaranteed. My sister arrived just before 9 am, and she went to check in, and she was told that there will be a charge for early check in. I was baffled, why was I not informed when I had precisely asked about the total of the entire stay after requesting an early check in. So I called the hotel directly and spoke to someone in accounting. They had no idea what I was talking about so he said he will call me back. But of course he didn't. So the next day I called back. Again I had to explain my situation. The person again said he has to call me back. I didn't hear back, so I called back that same day but the accounting office was closed. I got a call the next morning explaing to me that because the check in occured before 3 pm there was charge. Before 3 pm? Whats early check in then? I am very disappointed that a starwood property was not completely honest when I made the reservation. I did make the reservation through starwood, but I had contact with the hotel. Nevertheless, even if it is a nice property with nice staff, I will not stay there again or recommend it to anyone. If the charge was previously made clear, then I would not have had a problem.

<Content>The Best Transit Hotel I Know Arrive at Schiphol's International terminal and walk to the hotel. What could be easier? My wife and I stayed here and greatly enjoyed our stay. The staff at the desk was very helpful and upgraded our room to the club level. The room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The club room was quite pleasant. The restaurant is not world class, but we have no complaint. I've read reviews of some of the other Schiphol hotels and offers of free airport shuttles that turned into expensive taxi fares. Why take the chance of being disappointed?

<Content>Great Stop over place We had to stay overnight to wait for another business partner. This was the quitest hotel I have ever stayed at. Everything is located in the airport, resturants, and a shopping mall. You can rent cars, or catch a local, or high speed train. It's not central to the city, but it has all modes of transportation avalalible to you.

<Content>NOt well located to see teh city Stayed here for a conference. Bad location for a conference becasue you're a train ride away from teh city centre so you really have to work to see anything. You also have to worry about getting te train back on time if you're out late.The hotel was outrageously expensiveformediocree accomodation and food. Generally service was slow and not well organised.I wouldnt stay here again at the prices and i wrote to teh Conference orgainser to say they should have a more central location next time.I don'y know why anyone would want to stay here unless they are just overnighting between flights and have seen Amsterdam before.

<Content>Loved the hospitality I was on a vacation with my family in europe, and we had planned a halt at Amsterdam. This was perfect, as we did not have to bother about airport transfers, gettign out of the airport in teh cold, etc. We got off, conviniently walked to check in, got exceptional service, and then using convinient trains, did sight seeing.

<Content>Great airport location!! Great hotel from a travelspoint of view.Stayed in this hotel because I had a flight the next morning.The hotel is in walking distance from the airport with shops open late evening and even a 24hour Starbucks at your doorstep.The staff was very friendly, although there was no welcome at the front door (Which I am used to from Sheraton).Checked in quickly and got a nicely decorated room. Not much of a view, but great bed, flatpanel TV and a decent bathroom (shower and bath seperate).The bar has a great centre location in the hotel and is at the bottom of the Atrium.For people who have a need to stay close to the airport, this is a great hotel. If you want to visit Amsterdam the next morning there are many better and cheaper hotels to stay.

<Content>LOVE THE LOCATION SHERATON AMSTERDAM AIRPORT HOTEL is the only Hotel located inside the Airport in Amsterdam. It takes hardly 2 minutes from the Arrival lounge to reach the Hotel lobby. You dont need to go out of the airport so even if its raining or snowing , you can reach the hotel safely and without spending any taxi money.Hotel is very reasonably priced at around Euro 150-200 , which is nothing by Amsterdam standards. You can get cheaper budget hotels in the city but after spending approx Euro 100 for the return Taxi fare , it works out to be cheaper than those budget hotels. You can also find some cheaper hotels around Airport but even those are not of Five star standard like Sheraton and you need to take shuttle bus to reach those hotels. Bus is free but runs at every 30 minutes interval. Very inconvenient specially if its raining and sometimes buses not come on time.Service and ambiance of the hotel is excellent. All the staff members are very courteous. For dining , Hotel restaurants are expensive but you dont need to worry about that. As you can just come out of the Hotel to reach Airport complex which is full of Expensive to budget Restaurants and fast food like Burger King , Delifrance , etc. Also many bars , supermarket and shopping. To go to the city centre , you can take a train which runs at regular intervals of 10-15 minutes and costs approx 3-4 euros.On top of everything you can get starpoints on your SPG card for which you can become a free member if you are not already.These points can be redeemed for your future stays in any starwood hotel. If you are a Platinum member of Starwood , Hotel will upgrade you to a Club floor room with club lounge facilities which has Complimentary snacks and drinks from morning till evening and also premium alcholic drinks in the evening. They might even upgrade you if you are only a Gold member. Only thing is that you need to request them if they can and mostly they will. As in my case , i am only a gold member and mostly I have been upgraded. It will depend upon the availablity and a bit of your luck. So overall it was a wonderfull experience for me with club lounge facilities as I was able to relax in the lounge with complimentary Black Label and snacks. Complimentary Internet is also available in the lounge.You can reach Gold level in Starwood by staying 10 nights in a year at any Starwood hotels like Sheraton , Le Meridian , etc.You can have more information at WWW.STARWOODHOTELS.COMORWWW.SPG.COMI have stayed at this hotel about 5-6 times now and all the time my overall enjoyment of the stay exceeded previous stay.I travel alot for my business and stay overnight in Hotels around the world approx 70 nights every year and Sheraton Amsterdam Airport Hotel is one of my favourite hotels I have ever stayed in my life due to its perfect location and value for money.

<Content>Just Wow! The rooms are just perfect. So, the only things I did not like here were:1. My room had a patch of red colour taint on the carpet. (But the carpet all round was plush, thick and very nice)2. The hotel is in the airport. I kind of dislike airport hotels because there isn't much to see when I am not working. (But the interior design and gym really compensated for the absence of the city)3. The TV was a CRT type, they should have these changed because many hotels even apartments have changed to LCDs, cost cheap what!! And for the rest, my goodness, it is really worth it. The bed, pillows, carpet, worktable, electrical appliances (except TV) are really goooodd...... the bathroom and room was so clean and nice. In a nutshell, location is terrible if you want to see a life, but the rooms were close to perfect for under 100 euros per night (corporate rate). everything was nice and very cozy.....hemmmmmmm, loved it......

<Content>A wonderful surprise I decided to stay at the Sheraton Amsterdam Airport Hotel at the end of my sister and my month-long excursion through Germany and the the Netherlands. Our flight left at 8:45, so we dreaded having to leave from the Roemer Hotel in Amsterdam at some ungodly hour. We stayed in a regular twin room for only 150 Euros. I knew before arriving that it was a bargain, but the surprise was the hotel itself. The Sheratons outside of the US are certainly a much better class of hotel. The service was friendly, efficient and attentive. Access to the business centre to use the computers was very easy. The room was large, well-decorated, and the bathroom has a separate shower and tub. The public areas were bright, open and modern. The view from the glass elevator was dramatic. The hotel had a very nice feel. We had a choice of the the second floor lounge and restaurant or the main floor bar for dinner. We chose the bar, which had fabulous food and great service. I felt sorry for all the suits who were huddled together talking or sitting eating their solitary meals. If that is their lot in life, then at least the hotel fed and sheltered them very well. Our previous Amsterdam hotel was four times the price and gave us not much better of an experience. If you're staying in a business-style hotel in the city, and even if you're not, the Sheraton Airport is worth seriously considering; it's an easy 10-minute train ride away from the central station, and you get tremendous value for your money. I'm not sure what the previous reviewer was talking about when she/he discussed the restaurants. The Mezzanine contains both a lounge and large restaurant which serves a breakfast. I've stayed many times in Club Level Rooms, but at this hotel, if you're on your own dime, I wouldn't bother, since the standard rooms and level of service is excellent.

<Content>Great hotel and very friendly service Have stayed here for business on the Club level. The rooms were impressive, comfortable and quiet. The Club lounge itself was also nice although not amazing, but is a good meeting place, and the 2nd floor bar is also very comfortable and a great place to have a night cap.Would definitely recommend this as a place to stay when visiting for business, but bear in mind that the rates are generally high due to this being an airport hotel.

<Content>high standard and good value Stayed here for 1 night. The proximity to the airport is just fantastic and it took me five minutes to get to check in on departure. The room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was excellent, and the service was polite and efficent. It was good value for money and I would most certainly stay here again.The only downside was the facility provided for breakfast. They used their club lounge which was a sort of replica of a standard airlines business class lounge(on the small side) Given the fact that they charge 27 euro for the breakfast, and not to use their main restaurant facility was a bit of a disappointment. Also no dining room was available for dinner in the evening, just a cafe type facility. Overall it was a 5 star standard, but lets itself down somewhat on the lack of choice with regard to eating. Given the fact that the dining room was closed, to charge an additional 4.50 euro to eat breakfast in your room is to say the least very unfair. The hotel is worth the money, The breakfast is not

<Content>Great hotel for an overnight stay Recently stayed at the Sheraton Amsterdam Airport Hotel. This hotel is absolutely fabulous. To access this hotel via the airport is an absolute breeze. Follow the signs which are clearly marked in the airport to this hotel. The trolleys at the airport allow you to take them right into the hotel. The hotel also allows you to use the trolleys back to the airport. The hotel itself is very beautiful, however they only offer a cafe and one restaurant but more than adequate. We stayed on the club floor and had a beautiful, big room with all the amenities, robes, slippers, bathroom with tub and separate shower If you have an opportunity to use the club lounge it is very adequate , open until 11 P.M.. Very clean and absolutely no noise from the airport. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are on a stopover. In fact even to get into the city of Amsterdam you can take the train from the airport , as the taxi cab fares are outrageous. You won't be disappointed in choosing this hotel.

<Content>Convenient. but very expensive. This was my third stay at the Sheraton Amsterdam Airport. The in the terminal location can not be beat when connecting thought Schipol. The rooms are clean, well furnished and in good condition. Depending on when you book the rates can be over $450.00 per night. The room service menu is one of the most expensive I have ever seen - $12.00 plus service fees for toast! My advice is book in advance or use SPG points to get a reasonable room rate and do not order room service.

<Content>Really one of the best hotels I stayed in! *The location is absolutely great when arriving or departing from Schiphol Airport. Just 2 minutes walking to the terminals. *The rooms in this hotel are great, very very clean, and spacious! The suites I stayed in are one the biggest I ever seen.*The breakfast has lots of choice, everything fresh.*Staff is really willing to do anything for you, when I forgot my telephone charger, they even gave me one of their owns. *Price is a bit high, but seen the location and facilities it is really worth it!

<Content>Convenient Airport Hotel If you are looking to stay near the Amsterdam airport, this choice is a no brainer. To be any closer to the airport, you鈥檇 need to be on a plane. It connects directly to the train station, food court and airport terminal which means there are many restaurant and bar options. The room was average size and furnished nicely. We didn鈥檛 hear any airplane noise or any other noise for that matter. It was very quiet. And my husband loved the fact that you could take the luggage cart from the hotel right to the terminal. The staff was attentive and efficient. The only problem was that the bellhop gave my husband horrible directions for the gas station (he needed to fill up the rental car before returning it) so it took him 45 minutes just to find a gas station and fill the tank. Bottom line is that we loved this convenience of this hotel and would stay again should we fly in or out of Amsterdam.

<Content>Business traveling in good shape Hotel was easy, a walking distance to airport. It was also hassle free to access the train to city center from the terminal which is around 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Groceries, mart were at the airport and you could grab almost anything when hungry, go down at back to the room within 15-20 minutes.Room was nice, a 5 star amenities in the room available. Complimentary wafer (local type) refilled daily. View was outstanding as my room facing the airport runaway. I've spend time in the gym which located at ground with separate access lift to the gym. And also i've enjoyed the executive lounge provided at the same level with my room. Guys, shoe polish machine available in front of the lift for quick shine.The only (-) i could comment was the breakfast range that they have. I was staying almost a week but still the same menu for the whole week. However, quality quite good and acceptable. Security at par with others, ving card used to access the room and lift.

<Content>So convenient for the airport I was staying here overnight en-route to another location, and was just looking for a hotel near to the airport as I didn't really have the time to get into Amsterdam city proper. This hotel is perfect - it's within walking distance from the airport; in fact, you don't even have to go outside, which is quite different from many hotels that brand themselves as airport hotels. No waiting for a shuttle bus or taking an expensive taxi.The hotel itself is fine - just what you'd expect from a decent Sheraton. The room was a good size, well equipped and a nice bathroom. One thing of note is the excellent soundproofing - I genuinely could not hear a whisper of plane noise.If you don't have much time and need a comfortable hotel to stay a night at Schipol, this is the place. If you've got more time, I'd recommend going into Amsterdam proper as you get to see something of the city, but for convenience and comfort on the airport doorstep, you can't beat the Sheraton.

<Content>Nice hotel, but not excellent I stayed at the Sheraton Amsterdam Airport hotel for two nights while attending a conference. The hotel was very nice, to room was good and the interior pleased the eye. However, there were a few glitches that I was not expecting from a high class hotel like the Sheraton:* There was no information on the reservation or at check-in time if breakfast was included in the room rate. As I was on a business trip, I did not have the chance to check this in advance either. The breakfast at the hotel costs 27鈧? so I was not very happy with the thought of having to pay that for myself or rush down to the airport for a decently priced breakfast. After checking with the reception, I eventually was informed that the breakfast was included in the room rate.The breakfast was ok, but the signs indicating the dishes were misplaced.* However, the bigger problem with my stay was with the shower. The shower drain was not working so I had to take a very quick shower before the basin filled. I informed the reception on the problem and they promised to fix it, but the next morning the problem remained. Overall my stay was nice, but considering the price and expectation level, I was a bit disappointed.

<Content>Great business hotel This is a great business hotel, minutes from the airport and trains. It has all the amenities expected in a Starwood business class hotel. The rooms are great, the beds are heavenly, and the location can't be beat. While it has none of the charm of the hotels located in the historic center of Amsterdam, it is the most convenient hotel for business with access to anywhere in the metropolitan area. I'd stay hear again when on business travel.

<Content>Convenience has its price The hotel is 2 minutes from the airport and what you save on a cab you pay in the room price. Still a night for Eur309 with extra cost for breakfast (Eur27), internet access, and telephone (Eur5/minute) is definitely not for budget travelers.

<Content>Great but expensive I love being able to get off the plane and walk to my hotel. The convenience of having the train station located within 2 minutes of the hotel adds to the convenience. Location, Location, Location.The downside is the price. It is the most expensive hotels I stay in in Europe. Might have reached the tipping point this year with the weak USD and I will have to look else where.The room is very good and the service from the staff is excellent. I enjoy the workout room and the sauna. Food is expensive but the Airport food service is two minutes away and very adequate. Just got better with the addition of a Starbucks.

<Content>Great Choice! Booked four rooms for 8 guests on the way to Africa for a mission trip.We had a 36 hour layover in Amsterdam. Although not inexpensive,the service was excellent and the staff went out of their way to accomadate us.The hotel itself is a breeze to find from inside the airport. You can take luggage trolleys with you to the hotel from the terminal. We had a seven am flight arrival time and although check in is not until 2pm ,we requested early check in if possible. Imagine our delight when we got here at 8am and were told ALL rooms were cleaned and ready for us! Some were very tired the next day and for a small fee got a late check out.The hotel itself is very nice and the room was immaculate and a good size with cozy beds. Our room looked over the runway which was fun!The staff kept our luggage for us at the front desk the next day when we went in to Amsterdam to sight see. No charge and no problems with LOTS of luggage!Thanks to the staff for trying to accomadate our every need!We will return to Sheraton for this reason!

<Content>One of the better airport hotels - but more for business stayovers I stay here regularly when I have an early morning flight home and it is one of the better airport hotels. It is convienent and a short walk direct to airport. Prices can vary from reasonable to ridiculous 鈧?75 - 鈧?75 per night....for the same room! Internet costs 鈧?9 per night, dinner is expensive and quality only ok - a bufet dinner is 鈧?0 pp which for what we eat I think is crazy and drinks are pricey too....but as a treat from the standard aiport hotels, it is nice and if you want cheaper food just head into the airport. Staff are friendly and always personal..i hear the gym is good here too but generally dont use it because of the short stays. Was put on the preferred member floor this time but doubt there is much difference between this one and the others from what I have experienced. Overall fine for 1 night stay but not if you plan to use it as a base for seeing amsterdam...

<Content>Favorite hotel at AMS Stayed one night between a flight from Africa and return leg to US in Oct 07. Have stayed at this hotel several times, primarily between flights. I appreciate the convenience of its location and ease of getting to the terminal for international check-ins. I like not having to wait for a shuttle bus or take a taxi. I usually get a rate of 150Euro which I find fairly cheap for airport hotels in Europe. Rooms are comfortable and I have not had noise problems, although I am always in a room facing the center of the hotel (i.e. not looking at a runway). Food is decent and prices typical of room service.

<Content>Layover Paradise in Amsterdam We were on our way back from our trip to Italy, and were forced to get tickets where we arrived at 10pm in Amsterdam. However, our flight did not leave Schiphol until 10am the next morning. Facing a 12 hour layover at night, we decided to give the Sheraton a try.We are very glad we did. It is the perfect stay if you are having an extended layover in Amsterdam/Schiphol Airport. The rooms are top notch, with some of the most comfortable beds available at hotel chains, many free amenities, clean and extremely comfortable rooms, and the best is that you do not have to worry about catching a shuttle or getting stuck in traffic trying to get back to the airport! You just roll of of bed, get ready, and walk directly into the airport without having to walk outside at all. Plus, their TV's link directly into the airport news network so you keep updated regarding arrivals and departures.Would recommend for anyone facing hours at the airport in Amsterdam! Well worth the money spent! (They even gave us a free upgrade for no charge.)

<Content>Great Place to stay, especially if you like the Aeroplanes We stayed in room 534 which had a great views of the planes arriving and departing, depending on which runway they are using. You need eyes in the back of your head! The hotel is really good, although a bit expensive. The staff are very friendly and helpful and a lovely Buffet Breakfast sets you up for the day. Its so handy for the Trains into Centraal Amsterdam, as its is all under one roof. You can go from the Airport to the Hotel and to the Train Station, without going outside. Its a really impressive place.

<Content>Best hotel at AMS I've stayed at several hotels at Amsterdam airport and this is by far the best. Of course the location is a major plus, but this isn't the only reason to prefer the Sheraton. On my previous trip I stayed at the Hilton which is also well-located within walking distance to the terminal, but the Hilton's rooms were abysmal in comparison. My standard room at the Sheraton had a fantastic bathroom with separate tub and walk-in shower. It also had a wonderfully comfortable bed, coffee/tea making facilities, and working temperature controls! Breakfast the next morning was fantastic, located in a stylish upscale dining room with a large hot buffet selection. The Sheraton also has a small fitness centre (although pretty good compared to many hotel gyms) and also a sauna and steam room. On a more recent trip to Amsterdam, during a long layover, I paid about 鈧?5 to access the Sheraton gym so I could shower and wake up in the gym.

<Content>Loved the Sheraton Stayed here over Easter holidays this year - fab hotel in a fab location.Good sized clean and comfortable room, clean and fresh bathroom. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful when we checked in and again when we had to use their Business room facility. The Voyager restaurant serves up some fabulous grub - try it once atleast.

<Content>Average at best. I stayed there one week ago and while I found the room average for a Sheraton I was very disappointed by the reception staff who I found surly and unhelpful.This was my first time there and will be reluctant to return.In my opinion the best thing about is is its location.

<Content>Absolutely loved it I cannot understand the bad reviews. We stayed here with our 13 year old son - when we checked in the receptionist looked at our boy and said 'I will give you a room with a great view'. He allocated a room and rang housekeeping straight away to order an extra bed. When we got to the room the bed was just arriving and the view was spectacular of planes landing and taking off. Our son was blown away!The room was spotless and large and the beds were heavenly. We had dinner in the Voyager Bar which was fine and the breakfast the following morning was wonderful with an extensive hot buffet and friendly staff. It was lovely to walk straight into the terminal and not have to catch a courtesy bus in the morning.I would recommend this lovely hotel to anyone and would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Don't understand the bad reviews I'm writing because I don't understand why people would give this hotel a bad review. I booked a day room after a night flight and layover in AMS en route to America. My flight landed at 6am and I wasn't expecting to check in until 8am, however, I had forewarned the hotel I'd be arriving early and they said they'd make all efforts to have a room ready - and it was. I found the room very well appointed and spotlessly clean - plush white duvets and nice bathroom. This is an above average Sheraton (going by US standards anyway) and more of the W Hotel brand. I had no problems with the internet. Six hours after a great room service dinner and soundless few hours of sleep, I was on my way feeling refreshed and more than happy with my decision to stay here. If you're looking for a layover hotel with a touch of class, you can't go wrong.

<Content>Just what we needed Stayed one night to catch an early flight. As others mentioned, the hotel is ideally located. We had a standard room, it was pleasant and had all the amenities we needed. The bed was comfortable, the room was excellently soundproofed so we had a good sleep. We not only avoided getting up in the middle of the night to travel to schiphol airport, but we added a restful evening and night to our trip. I recommand it.

<Content>Great airport hotel I stay at this hotel regularly for work and I love it.The rooms are extremely well-appointed, clean, quiet and comfortable. There are some nice views of the airport. There is a good gym. The staff are friendly and helpful.My only complaint would be that the restaurants and room service are expensive but there are plenty of shops and restaurants at the airport which I use. There is a direct physical connection between the hotel and the airport so it is easy to get across.Clearly this hotel would only be of interest to someone arriving at or leaving the airport first thing in the morning or late at night, or someone working in one of the business parks or towns around Schiphol. No-one would want to stay here on holiday or if they are working in Amsterdam.However, if you are happy with the location, the hotel is great. By far the best at the Schiphol.

<Content>Good experience! The Sheraton Amsterdam Airport Hotel is in my opinion the best option to stay at Schiphol. Biggest plus is ofcourse the direct connection to the Airport itselves. Biggest min is the sometimes extreme pricelevel.I arrived in the evening to get some sleep before my next flight departing the following morning.Check-in goes fast, staffmembers are kind, a little bit to formal but speak good English.The rooms are very nice and very quiet, good soundproof so ideal for a good sleep!Rooms are equipt with a large soft bed, a big workingdesk, multiple chairs and a big television.The bathroom is well decorated and offers a seperate bath and shower which is very nice.The minibar is well equipt but expensive, roomservice menu is large and offers a good quality and variety of dishes but is also expensive.Overall; a very good place to stay altough prices are sometimes way to high, 350 euros for 1 night?? Come on!

<Content>Very dissapointed My husband and I stayed two nights in the Hotel in July 2007. We were very dissapointed with the room. It was small and needed maintenance (wall paper pealing, shower leaking) and a thorough cleaning (the floor had sort of rust marks on the bathroom floor and bath needed a clean as well as the carpets). The bedding was not as smooth as one would have expected. The airconditioner did not cool the room down at all. Luckily it was rainy and not too hot at the time. The receptionists did not smile ever! The breakfast was ordinary to dissapointing and the service there was very distant with NO smiles at all.The only thing I enjoyed was the location at the airport. We asked for a non-smoking room and the receptionistr stated the whole hotel has non-smoking rooms but our room and cushions smelled of stale smoke. There were no other rooms availible to switch to. This was NOT the standard for the Sheraton that I was used to- not for Europe or the USA.

<Content>Convenient but mixed experience Spent one night (Sunday) there. It's located right in the middle of the airport and is therefore convenient to both the planes and the trains. The Manager told me that 80% stay there only one night., often to catch an early departing plane. I wonder about the other 20%, as the hotel has about the same ambiance as would a hotel located in the middle of a Walmart's.Most stay there because of convenience, not pleasure and the hotel reflect this. The food is overpriced and barely adequate, but the same is true at the restaurants at the airport/train station so there are not many options. The rooms are of Motel 8 standard and many have no views.Here's an important tip: The official check in time is 3:00 PM. However, because many arrive earlier than that on planes, the hotel makes every effort to accommodate early arrivals by expediting early check ins.. Baring that, they will allow incoming early guests to shower and change in the exercise area.Avoid the place if the internet is important to you, because the hotel clearly lacks bandwidth, and the service slows down to the point of being unusable during the afternoons and early evenings.In short, if one keeps one's expectations in control, the hotel won't disappoint.

<Content>Great, hassle free stay We've just returned from a really relaxing 2 night stay at the 5* Sheraton hotel at Schipol Airport. Having got through baggage reclaim, we followed the signs for the Sheraton, which was only minutes away. However, we made the mistake of going outside to get to the hotel, when in fact there were escalators up to the main reception entrance, which is located on the first floor - doh!The reception staff were very welcoming and spoke impeccable English.Check-in is normally 3pm but we had an early flight, so arrived at 9am. We'd requested an early check-in on our booking, and as we were the first to arrive that day, we were told we would only have to wait a couple of hours for our room. So, they locked our bags away, and we went for a wander round Schipol shopping Plaza.As promised, our room was ready by 11am. The receptionist gave us our bags and asked if we needed them taking to our room - which we didn't (we were travelling light). We thought this was a refreshing change, given that you often don't get an option in 4/5 star hotels regarding transferring your baggage to the room, and so then feel pressured to tip for a a job you could have easily (and usually preferably in our case) done yourself!We booked a deal with a club room which gives access to the club lounge where you can get drinks and snacks all day from 7am - 11pm (and is where you get breakfast if you're in a club room). It wasn't the best club lounge I've been in (I'm afraid I've been spoiled by the luxury of Dubai) but it was on the same floor so was really handy, especially for checking out, and breakfast (the choice was quite varied and the experience was hassle free given the small number of people with access to the club lounge).Our room was very clean  spacious, modern in decor, and had a Queen size bed as well as a large desk  chair and a comfy chair with footstool. There were tea/coffee making facilities (percolator style) and a mini bar, and waffle biscuits  2 small bottles of mineral water were left each day . The TV has plenty of english speaking channels including BBC1  BBC2 as well as pay per view.There was a power shower, and also a large separate bath tub - all the usual complimentary stuff was there including a sewing kit!Room service is available later in the day, you just need to put a privacy notice out and call them when you're going out. We only had room service once, since we were only staying 2 nights, and were 'thanked' for not asking for bed linen to be changed. I was puzzled by this as we hadn't consciously asked for bed linen not to be changed, but we didn't mind. I presume there should have been a notice left regarding their environmental policy (I think towels have to be left in the bath if you want them changed).Transport into Amsterdam was really great. The trains go from the terminal (2 minutes walk) every 15 minutes (until 1am, then every hour). It only costs 6.20鈧?for a 2nd class day return (valid 'til 4am the next day), and the journey only takes 15-20 minutes. The trains themselves are double-decker and have 1st and 2nd class carriages - they're really smooth-running  quiet.Once you get into Amsterdam, you can walk to the various sights, or get a tram. If you're going to be hopping on and off trams, it's cheaper to get a 'strippenkart' - we didn't bother this time as we walked to most places, but I think the hotels  newsagents sell them.Due to being based at the airport, our return journey home was also stress free - no worries about traffic hold ups getting to the airport, just 2 minutes walk, and you're there.All in all, it was a very pleasant and relaxing trip.

<Content>convenience can't be beat I stayed here overnight transiting back to the U.S. from Estonia. The hotel is everything you expect from a Sheraton. The room was quite nice and very quiet. The bathroom was huge, it had a separate shower and tub. The train into Central Amsterdam is quick, cheap and clean. The staff did an especially good job of notifying guests about the time change that occurred in the middle of the night.

<Content>Absolutely love this hotel. I flew back into Schipol in the week between Christmas  New Year. Mine was the last flight to land as a blizzard had set in. It was like a Dickins tale, hazardous conditions outside  no way of getting the 200 miles home.The Sheraton was the only hotel at the time that had any spare rooms. So my girlfriend  I booked it. The good thing was we could get to the hotel without going outside.I have to say the staff where fabulous  the room service was out of this world. Everything arrived hot  freshley cooked.We stayed again a few months later with my parents  the service in teh hotel was even better. My parents where both given a pair of slippers each  the old faithful of a chocolate on the pillow.I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody. With the dutch railways being as efficent as always its only a short journey to the centre of Amsterdam.

<Content>Great Hotel and Service Upon check-in the entire reservation system was down, but the staff was efficient and polite. Although the rooms was clean the ittems had not been put back, i.e garbage, drawers pushed back in, etc). The hotel was very nice and convenient specifically if you are traveling since you will not need extra time to get to the airport. It is a train ride to the major attractions as well. Watch out for the breakfast buffett in the main restaurant. Although wonderful it is 27 euros per person and they neglected to tell us that. Enjoy!

<Content>Awesome location! This hotel is in a fantastic location. It is right next door (literally) to Schiphol Airport. From the arrivals hall, you don't even have to go outside to get to the hotel. It is right next to the Schiphol World Trade Center. As far as the hotel itself goes, pretty standard Sheraton with good service catering to the business traveler. The room was pretty spacious for a European room and had all the amenities required. The breakfast restaurant (buffet) was VERY good! (a little on the pricey side, but to be expected)As far as getting to central Amsterdam, couldn't be easier. A quick walk to the Schiphol train station (right underneath the airport) and a fast 10 minute train ride puts you right at Amsterdam Centraal Station.For my next business trip to Amsterdam I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Very convenient, very nice Stayed here for 2 nights on business and absolutely loved it.The hotel is ultra-convenient - you can walk from your plane to the hotel entrace without having to go outside, thanks to the brilliantly signposted and organsed Schipol Airport.Inside of the hotel is stunning, very plush - lovely reception areas, great restaurant next to indoor waterfalls - that sort of thing. I was particularly impressed with the Boomerang bar where were hanging out for a bit. Cosy, lovely environment, nice big leather sofas - perfect for a socialising or a meeting, with good bar food. The restaurant next door to it served more fine-dining style food which was also pretty good.Rooms are decent - typical Sheraton, well equipped with everything you'd want.No other complaints. Room service arrived within 10 minutes on the occasion I ordered it. Maids were happy to make up my room at 7pm. Most of all, the free biscuit you get with your room ('Stroopwafels') were absolutely lovely - I wanted to make sure I had my room made up so I could get some more. A big difference from the usual meagre offering you find at hotels.One warning - it IS expensive. Fortunately I wasn't paying, and had an expenses bill for food, but expect severely OTT prices for most stuff. 16 euros for a pay-per-view movie, main courses at around 30 euros in the restaurant. This is to be expected, but you should bear in mind that if you plan on utilising a lot of the hotel's services, you will pay for it.Would I stay here again? Absolutley.

<Content>Convenient location but not 100% satisfied We stayed at the Sheraton for 1 night while we had a 30 hours before a flight back home. The airport location was great, no need to go outside at all. The train took only 15 minutes to get to the city center and you could walk out of your hotel and literally be able to check in for your flight. However, I was a little bit amazed that the hotel was charging 5 euro for 15 minutes of internet usage. I havent lived in Europe in 10 years so I am not too sure but maybe internet is very expensive in Amsterdam and thats why they were charging, to me, outrageous prices for internet service. Also, our flight was not until 4:30 pm the next day and we asked if it was possible to check out at 2pm, instead of the 1pm time listed. We were told that there was a 10e charge for every hour stayed over. We could not believe it...I have NEVER (and i mean never) been asked to pay for staying an hour over the check out time. At 12 oclock we were also called to ask when we were checking out and had a cleaner knock on our door at 12:30, which I thought was rude. I really liked the decor of the hotel, was very modern and clean. The rooms were quite small but very comfortable and the bed was great! I also thought the bathroom looked very nice. The front desk people were also friendly and nice.

<Content>Clean business convenience The location within the airport can't be beat for convenience, and there is easy access to the train system. The room was sparkling clean and quiet, with a comfortable bed, nice bathroom/shower and decent business-class amenities. Large, clean, contemporary common areas. On the downside, I agree with previous traveler's description of the property as a soulless place intended for very short business stays.

<Content>Convenient and comfortable In my experience by far the most convenient hotel when flying out of Schiphol Airport. Practically inside the airport building. Probably not the best choice when you are visiting Amsterdam for several days, this is very much a place where people stay one night only. Lots of people arriving and leaving. Somewhat soulless and businesslike atmosphere. The rooms however are clean, comfortable, quiet and have very nice beds. I deducted one star because the restaurant quite frankly is bad value - the food is OK but too expensive.

<Content>Excellent Booked through Octopus Travel. They had the best deal by far. This hotel has the best location for Schiphol. No hanging around in the freezing cold waiting for buses. Members of the Starwood Preferred Guest program get a room on the SPG floor. Room was a good size, overlooking the terminal, but with views of the aircraft. Very comfortable twin beds with duvets and chair with foot stool. Large mirrored wardrobe with safe, trouser press, ironing board and iron. Quiet and efficient airconditioning with adjustable thermostat. Large bathroom with bath and separate shower cubicle. Plenty of towels and good range of toiletries, including mouthwash. Bathrobe behind the door and heated floor. Complimentary bottle of Spa blauw (still) water and stroopwafels (syrup biscuit). In room coffee maker with regular and decaf coffee, earl grey and camomile tea. Breakfast was included in the rate, but I didn't take advantage due to time constraints. The only complaint I have is that the in room express check out didn't work, and there were only 2 staff on the desk. I only had to wait 5 minutes, but the line was growing longer behind me. Staff very friendly though, and apologised for the wait.All in all a good experience in a country not renowned for its levels of customer service.

<Content>Very good experience Just stayed night of 14th November 2006, got a very good rate including buffet breakfast from otel.com.Ensure you shop around for good rates do not pay Hotel rack ratesFriendly check in staff ,given Excellent double room, very comfy bed and pillows.Good Location at the Airport for early departures ,head towards Parking Area 1, via Schipol Plaza after leaving arrivalsA very brief walk back to the Plaza allows you to catch a train to Amsterdam Central, journey time is around 18 minutes and trains run very frequently, Return Journey costs around 7 euros.Beware - If paying the buffet breakfast was poor value, Ok for cereals and fruit,poor quality cooked breakfast.

<Content>Attached to the airport and great sauna My husband and I stayed here for 1 night as part of our honeymoon. They didn't offer any specials for honeymooners.Overall, we were very pleased with our stay although in some ways it didn't quite hit the 5* standard.The good and the bad...GOOD1. Really comfy bed.2. Well maintained cosy sauna and steam room (no jacuzzi or pool).3. You don't even have to go outside, it's just 5 minutes walk from the airport.4. They stamp your loo roll with a Sheraton embossed logo.5. Magnificent building with views of the planes from some rooms.BAD1. No express checkout and it took ages, leave 30 mins extra.2. Tea and coffee facilities in the room had not been cleaned and properly replenished.3. When we ordered more in-room tea and coffee it never arrived and we had to cancel it.4. The restaurant is pricey and they messed up our order, although they did sort it out with no fuss.5. It doesn't include breakfast.

<Content>3 star service in a 4 star setting Got a good rate on priceline-would of been really angry if we paid posted rates . Great location (connected to airport) 15 min train ride to central amsterdam.Shower floor looked as if someone emptied a mop bucket in it. When we complained about poor drainage they told us they all do that. Food is VERY expensive. We do not recommend the restaurant at all. Quality is lacking for price. Nice atmosphere though.Our room service breakfast for one cost us around 50 US dollars and was wrong even after brining us the correct order. They compd us coffee but did not include cream. The tray stayed outside our room for over 12 hours.Housekeeping ignored our do not disturb since, and insisted that I tell her when we would be out of the room. Our room did not get made up that day dispite putting a request in with guest services who said I dont know ousekeepings hoursGood location but poor quality.

<Content>Convenience The Hotels location is right in the airport so the visitor can take an escalator from his room to the train station and be at Centraal Station in 20 minutes.Rooms are roomy and recently updated. New spa features plenty of exercies equipment. Breakfast Buffet is delightful with lots of choice from pancakes to seafood along with made to order eggs. Clean hotel overall with a friendly efficient staff. You get what you pay for with no surprises.

<Content>A Great Time My wife and I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Sheraton Airport in Amsterdam. We found it very comfortable and accessable to locale transportation. I would also like to mention how the staff was very friendly and helpful, i.e. Frank in the restaurant and Daniel as bell staff.

<Content>Modern, Classy, Convenient Excellent hotel, with facilities  service of the highest standard. Location is great for airport  trains- it is a very short (5 minute) indoor walkway from both. Many trains then run direct from Schipol to Centraal Station (fastest takes 10 mins). This also meant we could make the most of our day before flying back, by leaving our bags at the hotel, to collect just before going for the flight.Modern, clean  pleasant decor. There were no renovations, referred to by others, going on  must have been completed. The lobby is impressive  the glass lift gives you a panoramic view of all the levels and attractive atrium seating area below.Breakfast is also delicious with a huge choice!Hotel is very quiet  beds were comfortable, so had a good nights sleep. Highly recommended.Amsterdam is small, so make use of trams  buses, or hire a bike- don't waste money on taxis. The best way to view it is on a canal cruise (a 1 hour one is sufficient).

<Content>Fairly average and overpriced Being an extensive business traveller I can say it was certainly not the best four star hotel I've stayed in and found the prices pretty high for the goods and services received. Unless your business or trip is specifically focused around Schipol I'd stay in Central Amsterdam. I won't be returning

<Content>Nickles and Dimes to Death I stay at this hotel from time to time as I often transit Amsterdam during my travels. The hotel is more than adequate but truly tries to nickle and dime you to death. Everything in the hotel is already expensive but then they hit for the ridiculous sum of 19 euros for 24 hours of internet service. Of course almost no one ever stays in a hotel of this type for more than 12 hours, but none the less they try and rob you. I am a member of Starwood preferred whatever it's called but this is ridiculous. No one apparently has the authority to waive these charges. I really wish someone would wise up and stop treating those of us that travel extensively as complete idiots.

<Content>Great Concierge! Convenient Location I recently stayed at this hotel with my family and parents while vacationing in the Netherlands. Paid about $125 a night via Priceline and was originally skeptical about access to Amsterdam and the expensive parking. Received a great hint on cheaper parking from a Tripadvisor member and access to Amsterdam was outstanding. The train from the airport is a few minutes walk from the hotel and once on board you are downtown in about 15 minutes (wish I knew this when I had a six hour layover several months earlier). All the concierge staff were extremely helpful. They offered great maps and provided answers to all of my questions. They were also very friendly and interested in engaging in conversation. The rooms were fine and you cannot hear a thing due to great soundproofing. The only drawback would be that I asked for a room with a view of the airplanes for my son and my parents actually got a much better view (we could only see the cargo planes). There is also a great grocery store in the airport that we were able to find just about anything we needed during our stay foodwise (although the sushi did not taste very fresh).

<Content>Convenience and really cool flooring in the lobby Dad was coming in on an early flight from the US. Instead of getting up at 3:00 a.m. to drive in to Schiphol, we decided to stay at the airport. Got a rate of 鈧?39 at expedia - and couldn't pass up the opportunity.The hotel is right in the airport - fall out of bed and wander over to check-in or - as in our case - to the arrivals area. I've see this hotel listed for well over 鈧?00 /night. Guess what, unlike the Conrad in Hong Kong or the Shangri-La in Shanghai, it just ain't worth it.Yes the rooms are good and very quiet. All new and well appointed - but it's missing all of those little details that move it up into the luxury class. I guess convenience has its price.Lobby area was under construction when we got there (hence the low price?). The mid-20s check in personnel were jaded and not as friendly as I expected. Was it my low expedia price that turned off the charm? Was it the fact that I didn't have a suit on? I may never know. Anyway - Sheraton - are you listening? You need to work on your front desk staff at this hotel, they just aren't up to the luxury level. They looked great - but that was about it.If you need a place to sleep between intercontinental flights - or have an early flight out - this hotel is great. Can be very pricey during the week - but look out for good deals on the weekend. During the week you may want to check out the Crowne Plaza. I think it is a better hotel - even if you have to take a shuttle bus.

<Content>Elegance and Convenience I arrived after a 10 hour flight and had to wait until the next morning to take another plane to my final destination. It was so convenient to arrive at this hotel in the morning and find I could check into my room upon arrival even though it was only 10 am. The room wss beautiful, the bed and linens the most elegant I have found anywhere, and the presence of so many shops and restaurants at the airport made it easy to find economical restaurant choices. Easy access to the railroad which takes one directly into the center of Amsterdam makes this hotel site the preferred one for a short or week-long visit to the city. Prices are comparable to the preferred hotels in the city center. The train from the airport to Amsterdam Central Station is only 20 minutes and the cost is only 3.60 euros each way. I had a 6 a.m. flight to Rome but was able to conveniently make the connection in the morning after a pleasant day and evening in Amsterdam with my preferred lodging at the Sheraton Amsterdam Airport Hotel and Conference Center. Very amiable and efficient staff throughout the hotel. You will not go wrong when picking this hotel as your hotel in very expensive Amsterdam - especially, if you are flying in and out of the city.

<Content>Comfortable and convenient airport hotel We stayed at the Sheraton AMS for a one-night layover on our way to Tanzania. For this purpose it was perfect. It is connected to the airport so you don't even have to go outdoors. We were able to check in, drop our bags off and clean up, and easily take a train into the city for a few hours of sightseeing in Amsterdam and a nice dinner. The train station is just downstairs from the hotel, so it couldn't be easier. The nice thing is that in the morning, you are already right at the airport if you have a morning flight out, so it saves a lot of time. The room was comfortable and extremely quiet. Service was good. I would definitely stay here again if I had another one-night layover at Schiphol.

<Content>Good place to stay Enjoyed a two night stay here at the Sheraton Amsterdam Airport Hotel.The bedroom was really lovely. Very comfortable and clean. Bathroom beautiful.Spotlessly clean.The staff we came across very nice and eager to please.Breakfast was a bit of a hit and miss on the first morning (Sunday )the staff seemed overstretched and pleasant but not very attentive.The Buffet was not always replenished.Was disappointing for a Sheraton Hotel.The next day (Monday)a huge difference and improvement to the whole breakfast experience.A lovely hotel. No aircraft/outside noise.Walking distance to the airport terminal.

<Content>Great convenience and comfort This hotel was a great surprise -- we could see the runways from our room, but did not hear any noise at all from the airport. There is a nice fitness area, with steam-room and sauna so that you can relax before or after a long flight. And in just 15 minutes, you can be in the middle of Amsterdam. This is an outstanding hotel, and I would not even qualify the statement by claiming that it is an outstanding airport hotel, for it is better than most non-airport hotels: it is just a great hotel. If you want a comfortable, convenient room, in a hotel that offers great service, this is the place. And we found a good rate on the room, so we did not find it to be pricey at all.

<Content>Fantastic I have stayed in a few airport hotels but this is the best by far. The location makes it ideal for easy access to and from the terminal. Literally a five minute stroll and you are there. With the ultra efficeient Dutch Railways you can be in Amsterdam within 15 minutes. Airport hotels can be noisy. This is not. This is down not only to the design of the layout with the elevators being in the central area away from the rooms, the glazing and the proper brick walls between the rooms. The rooms are large by the standard of many such as the Hilton at Gatwick, and are very comfortable. The staff are friendly and efficient. I would recommend staying there if you are visting Amsterdam. Great place to stay

<Content>great location; very quiet; courteous staff Stayed here last night of our trip to Amsterdam because of its location to airport (actually right in the airport although you would never know it) We took my 85 year old dad on his first European vacation and he was having trouble walking which was the reason for booking this location right at the airport. The hotel is very modern and the staff courteous. The room was more than adequate; more than enough fresh towels, toiletries, etc. We needed a cot which was delivered in less than 10 minutes. Did not hear one plane which was a concern at first. Nice and quiet and the beds are fantastic. Public transportation, taxis, etc. are all there. Would highly recommend this hotel. You will not be disppointed.

<Content>Very nice airport hotel We were here 1 night in April. Our plane was overbooked and we had to stay a night at the airport on behalve of the Airline company. The hotel is quite expensive (rackrate), but the room looks very nice for an airport hotel. This hotel is the closest to Schiphol airport and when you check out, you simply walk quickly into Schiphol. There is a small restaurant closeby where they serve a nice meal in cozy atmosphere. The shops of Schiphol Airport are closeby, therefore, you do not have to be as bored as in most Airport Hotels. The hotel is also close to the trainstation of the airport, so you can be in Amsterdam with no problem.The bed was one of the best hotel beds we have slept on. The bathroom looked nice and everything was clean. There was no noise, so you can get an easy sleep.I can reccomend this hotel if you find a nice deal.

<Content>A very quiet hotel Yes, quiet at the airport! I stayed there just 1 night and a couple of weeks later stayed at the Shereaton's premier property, Hotel Pulitzer. I liked this much better and is was 100 Euros a night cheaper! They have a new work out area which was also better. First a couple of Euros you can take a 15 minute train right from the airport into the town. The beds are fantastic too! Consider this an alternative to staying in town!

<Content>Had a very pleasant stay I stayed on the club floor of this hotel because all the other rooms were booked the weekend I was in Amsterdam. It was one of the best hotel experiences I've had in Europe. It was clean, staff was friendly, the amenities were amazing -- nothing bad to say about it, really.If you get bored, there is a train at Schiphol airport which will take you into Amsterdam's city centre in about 20 minutes -- very convenient. My friends were staying in another hotel in the city centre, so it was extremely easy for me too meet up with them.Staying on the club floor was a little pricy, but well worth it. In the evening, there were free drinks at the bar, and free refreshments during the day. There is also a small grocery store and numerous restaurants in the airport, which the hotel is connected to. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly, and they actually seemed genuine. Now, it's not in the city centre, but I didn't mind it at all, because when you finally have to leave Amsterdam, you don't have to worry about how you'll get back to the airport -- you'll be in it. I would definitely stay there again.
