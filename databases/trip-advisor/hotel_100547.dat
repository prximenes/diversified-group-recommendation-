<Content>Good Enough Stayed here for a long weekend. We got a good deal on the room price ($110.00/night) for the location.The a/c did not work and we had to prop the window with a sturdy book. The window was very heavy. I noticed other patrons were creative in their window-propping; a wooden coat-hanger for example.The bathrooms were nice with marble vanity etc. Other reviews complained of the smallness of the bathrooms, but we found this to be okay. Clean with good soaps, shampoos.Easy walk to Underground Tour and Pike's Market. Staff were real nice and let us check in early on a rainy day.The airport bus (Grey Line) shuttled right around the corner which was very convenient. Free WiFi!

<Content>Charmless but adequate for a short stay We stayed here because it was part of a block booking for a conference. Our experiences were similar to those of other reviewers, i.e. small rooms with dreary decor, mostly indifferent front-desk service, and noisy (very noisy if, like us, you get an inward-facing room overlooking the kitchen air con units!).On the positive side, the tiny bathroom was spotlessly clean and the shower was excellent. Plus the bed was really comfortable.Yes, the hotel is in a reasonably convenient downtown location, but that barely makes up for the downsides.If like us you simply need a place to put your head down for the night, and are likely to spend the rest of your time out and about in Seattle, then this modestly-priced hotel should suffice for a few nights. But there aren't enough creature comforts to make you want to stick around and relax in it during the day or evening. After 5 nights we were certainly glad to be moving on.

<Content>Give it a miss! I stayed in this hotel, with a friend, over the weekend of the 19th-21st September. I had stayed there before and recommended my friend book on the basis of my last stay, which was reasonable. But that was definitely not the case this time around. There were so many disappointing things about our weekend at the Executuve Hotel Pacific........1.We were placed in a room directly opposite the elevators on the 5th floor. The noise from the elevators and other guests returning home until the early hours of the morning was very loud (and i am usually a heavy sleeper, and i could still hear it clearly , on and off, throughout the night). Also the cleaning staff made such a racket in the morning it was difficult to sleep past 7am.2.We made a specific online request to have a small fridge in the room for medications. This was obviously ignored online, as were our pleas to have something done about it when we checked in. Previously, in other similar hotels, we were offered a small portable fridge/cooler for the exact same purpose.3. The air conditioning did work (ie turn on) but produced a worrying, burning smell when it was turned on (as if it had not been used for weeks). So we tried to open the window which was stuck down, so we could only open in a few cm to try and let some cool, fresh air into the now stuffy room.4. The bathroom was small, but the size itself wasn't the main issue. The shower head had virtually no pressure and the toilet was VERY, VERY noisy every time we flushed (and we could hear the toilets of adjacent rooms quite clearly too). Very old, poor plumbing.5. When we suggested to the front desk staff that they should move us because of all of the above reasons, they said they were fully booked for our first night but could change our rooms for the second night. We agreed. When we presented to the front desk for our new room the next day, the new staff member stated nothing had been documented in their book about a room change, and again they were booked out so they could not help us. In fact, they freely admitted that they had just used up the last room for the guest who checked in minutes before, and they had overbooked...so they still had to find rooms for 4 guests who had yet to check-in. Not something that i imagine a reputable hotel does(or admits to their other guests!).So all up, we were glad to check-out and will not be returning to this hotel. Next time we will gladly pay a few extra dollars for a decent hotel room and some service!

<Content>Dingy, little stinky and way too small The check-in personnel were lovely. That is the extent of the positive comments I can make. The hallways are dingy and run down. The room is remarkably small and poorly appointed. The bathroom is so small you have to walk in, scootch around the door and close it before you can take a seat. The bathroom is small, dark and weird. I have no idea what they were thinking with a Carerra marble divider. There's no light to begin with! The window panes let all the lovely city noise in for a more authentic experience. For the money, not impressed. If you are a business traveler like myself, skip it all together.

<Content>Terrible Customer Service w/ Paper Thin Walls I was very disappointed with my stay at this hotel. When I booked I let them know that it was for a Bridal Shower from 6pm-11pm and asked if they had any restrictions, quiet hours, etc. They said no and that it would be just fine, so I booked (2) rooms. Upon arriving and checking into our rooms we noticed that we could hear every word said next door...the walls were paper thin! Noise was a definite problem and I would not have booked here if they had been honest with me as I had been with them about the purpose of our stay. They could have done so much to avoid the situation by putting us in a corner or end room as I book (2) suites! I talked to a hotel representative letting her know my disappointment since I had arranged this ahead of time but also my understanding of other guests since the hotel did not plan well and asked it we could be moved, etc. She responded very annoyed and was not open to any resolution besides us going to sleep....it was around 9:50pm on a Saturday night and we had about an hour left of our shower. To make matters worse both rooms that we stayed in were prank called. From 1am-3am the phones would ring and when we would answer it was just hold music. These calls could not have come from guest rooms (we tried calling each other) as the guest room phones did not have a hold button. It got so bad that we had to unplug the phones but needless to say that we did not get any sleep. When I asked at checkout if they had been having any troubles with their phones they said they were working just fine. Granted I have no proof that the hotel made these calls, but it seems very unlikely that both our rooms would have this problem and that hold music would be in the back ground.Also, the next morning at 9:15am a maid banged on our door asking when we were leaving....check out wasn't until 11am. Overall if you want to pay $250 for a place to sleep where there is no customer service what so ever, then this is the hotel for you. Otherwise I recommend staying away and spending your money where you will be taken care of properly.

<Content>Nothing Special We recently stayed at this hotel for a weekend trip.Overall, the hotel was just alright, as the location is fairly convenient, but after saying that, if you find any hotel in the downtown area, it will be convenient.The hotel is clean, the staff is pretty friendly, and the rooms are very small, especially the bathroom, which was terribly small.Our air conditioning unit wasn't barely working and it was pretty loud at night. The elevators are very slow as well. I am not sure if there is free wireless internet service but there is one computer for public use.Anyway, if the was price is right, i'd stay there again but this wouldn't be my first choice.

<Content>Good Exeprience We got a good deal compared to other Seattle prices and as we were only using the hotel as a base so we didn't expect too much. Location of the hotel was good and the room was quiet and clean. We had a safe and free wi-fi. Only downside was the room was on the small side and the bathroom was tiny.

<Content>Middle of the Road I'm not sure whether to recommend this hotel for the great old feel and comfy beds, or to not recommend it for the terrible service of the front desk staff and the dirty appearance of the bathroom. My husband and I stayed here over the weekend and found that the location of the hotel is wonderful, if not perfect. The condition of the hotel is, however, far from perfect. The headboards had tears in them, the bathroom was less than sanitary feeling, the room was rather small, and the paint was coming off of the baseboards in places. I feel like there were cosmetic changes that could have been made to make the room more appealing without spending a lot of money on the part of the hotel. Nonetheless, the beds were great, the tv was nice and conveniently placed, and the feel was nothing less than hisotric Seattle. If you are expecting something breathtaking I don't recommend this hotel. If you simly need somewhere to stay- this will suit you fine!

<Content>Go elsewhere I do not recommend staying here. Staff were routinely indifferent, almost to the point of being rude. The parking arrangement (a public garage up the hill and around the corner) was remarkably inconvenient. (Anyone with mobility issues will find the parking and even the hotel challenging to maneuver.) The rooms were adequate but not well maintained or cleaned particularly well. The hotel is not so much bad as you can easily do much better in Seattle. Definitely go elsewhere.

<Content>Horrible Customer Service I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend at the time for 2 nights on Valentines Day, it was okay, but INCREDIBLY overpriced for what you get. You can hear EVERYTHING that goes on in the room next door, all night we could hear the couple next door having sex, it was horrible. I accidently left a dress still with tag on in the closet and when I called the next day to have them hold it for me, they said it was no longer there and housekeeping checked the closet and never found it...liars and thieves!!! Also, I needed to get my cell phone which I left in my car, the valet service offered to go get it, which was VERY nice, HOWEVER, the guy left my light on and caused my battery to die, which in turn took the valet 30 minutes to get my car once we needed it in the morning. I would DEFINETLY stay somewhere else and not waste my money here....ps bathrooms crappy!

<Content>Cracker Box The room was tiny. It barely accommodated the two uncomfortable double beds. The bathroom was also very small, almost no vanity space.There are two vending/ice areas, on the 5th and 7th floors. We were on the second floor.Definately NOT worth the sticker price!!!!

<Content>Reminded me of the Tower of Terror at Disney we stayed in the hotel while we had four days in Seattle between July 25 and July 29. It was the only one available when we booked through United vacations. Other unavailable possibilities are located close by.My first impression when we arrived from the airport at 1am was that the decor was dull and dreary, and our mood wasn't helped by the necessity to drag our cases down a small flight of steps to reach the elevator. The overall decor of the hotel and the room reminded me of the build up to the Tower of Terror ride at Disney -- dark, less than welcoming, with an old fashioned lift.The room on the 8th floor was ok, but there were black marks on the lower part of the walls where items, or feet, had inadvertently connected. Our room was also too close to the lift, and we could hear the lift mechanism. Like some other reviewers, we could hear people in the next room without much difficulty. In hindsight, maybe we should have asked for a better room, but we figured that we weren't going to be in the room much, so we'd persevere.You can't fault the location. It's right next to the city centre and the public market, and the tour buses pick you up from the hotel. There are some good restaurants within two or three blocks, because the hotel only has a coffee shop. We fell in lucky, we were in Seattle on the night of the excellent Torchlight procession (unintentionally). There's 900,000 people live in Seattle, and half of them must have been in the procession!The people are nice and friendly, the trips we had were excellent, but the next time we go to Seattle, we won't be staying at the Exec Pacific -- unless the owners put their hands in their pockets and pay for a much needed major refurbishment. It's a waste of an excellent location in a friendly city.

<Content>Do NOT stay here!! Save your money and go elsewhere! Unfortunately, I didn't look for reviews until after I had booked  then it was too late to get a room anywhere else. You park around the corner in the Olympic garage, which doesn't have an elevator to every floor, so I had to carry my luggage down a flight of stairs. You come out on 5th St., and then I had to take all my stuff all the way around the block to get to the hotel entrance. My first room was gross-- hairs in the sheets, towels, cracked tiles in the shower. Hot and cold are backwards (in all rooms). No counter space to put my toiletries. Only one working electrical outlet. I was woken up so many times after going to bed by the noise (thin walls!) that I had to call and get moved. (They DID do that.) My second room was a little cleaner, but still not up to normal standards for a moderately priced hotel. (And this place isn't moderately priced.) I had to be moved to a third room due to the second room not being a 2-queen room (I had husband and kids arriving). The third room had only one working electrical outlet and that was in the bathroom. Again, no counter space. Broken shelf. Hairs in my clean towel (YUCK). The noise was awful; doors banging everywhere; you can hear the toilets and showers and conversations from the next rooms. There is one ice machine  it is on the 7th floor. No kidding. The elevators are incredibly slow-- there are only 2 of them and they are also tiny. You have to go up or down stairs to get to them from the hotel entrance. The hotel had told me I could have a late checkout, due to the hour that my class went to. By random chance, I double checked this on my last day since that I was still down for late checkout  was told I couldn't have that late checkout or I'd be charged another night. I asked when they were planning to tell me that-- when I got back late and they had already charged me??!! No response-- and this was from a MANAGER!! He also tried to tell me I hadn't packed my bags up to have the bellhop move me from room #2 to room #3 -- which was a total lie. He stood there and actually implied that I was lying to him. I was furious and told him that it was the worst hotel I had ever, EVER stayed in, and he just stood there smirking and nodding. He never made any attempt to remedy anything, nor to apologize. I was there with six other coworkers and they had similarly bad experiences with the noise and dirt. There is no hotel food service. Even if it costs you a little more, stay somewhere else!!! Motel 6s are nicer than this place.

<Content>Ancient Hotel Read the majority of the negative comments that shold tell you something.Its a early 1900 building that had some new carpet, and some marble in the front entrance and there you are. There is NO access for a whhelchair. You park out front and load your luggage in the hotel taking it down some stairs a placing it on a cart and hoping on an old clanky elevator. Once your done, you have to drive the car to a public parkade in the next building over. Its unfornate that you can not drive under the building and unload the car and have an elevator take you to your floor.The bathroom was smaller than small, the rooms we tiny, and carpet had a stain, and an electrical wire that was sheathed and screwed to the wall came off the wall. The door to the room had a deadbolt (thankfully), however, the old style manual slider lock with a chained piece that was connected to the wall was broken off and made me wonder if this room was recently broken into? The building should be knocked down and a new one constructed. Anyhow, its not worth what we paid. Its in an okay location, but in my opinion is a 2 star hotel.

<Content>Very good for the price...but they need to dust a bit more! Got a very reasonable price...at least $50 less per night than the best deal I could find on Expedia. It's an older, refurbished hotel so, yes, the rooms are small, but they're livable. Plus there's an open living room area on the Mezzine that has free wi-fi, so if you do need room to stretch you can do it there. The bed was very comfortable and I found the rooms and hallways to be very quiet. I think the older construction actually helps in this case. Unlike the newer hotels that are basically metal and cinder block, the Hotel Pacific actually seems to have thick insulated walls. It's also within good walking distance of shopping and Pike's Market. I was in town for a conference and it was about a 10 minute walk to the Convention Center.The drawbacks? A crotchety elevator that stopped working once or twice and the hotel could use a good scrubbing from top to bottom. While the rooms were generally clean (the curtain sheers could use a washing) I'm currently looking at a visible layer of dust on the light fixtures in the hotel lobby. Not a deal breaker but they should break out a ladder and take care of details like that.

<Content>sleepless in seattle! really! we had a quick one night stopover in seattle on our way to vancouver. we chose this hotel as it was recommended in lonely planet. GOD NO! the rooms were TINY, and the walls paper thin, with lots of strange characters coming and going at all hours. we asked to be moved from our initial room (with a great view of car park) as there was the constant sound of a baby crying. our second room (same size, even better view of car park) was even noisier, and we were kept up all night by people in the room next door having very loud and vocal sex. if you want to sleep in seattle, this is not the place for you.

<Content>My walk in closet at home is bigger.. and i'm not rich! We picked this hotel based on the pictures and the price on Expedia. The rack rate charged by the hotel is insane considering I could have gotten a decent motel/lodge for half the price. The room that was given to us was about 12'x9'. 12x9 doesn't sound too bad but put a queen sized bed, two end tables, a dresser/tv stand, and a lounge seat and you don't have enough roomm to breathe! The bathroom is no different. Good luck sitting on the toilelt. You need to be aware of surroundings. As soon as you sit down and sit upright, you feel a sharp pain as the bathroom sink enbed's inteself into your left shoulder blade! I would recommend using priceline or whatever else you can to go for a better hotel. If you want to save money, stay out of downtown and def. stay away from this hotel. It is renovated but they didn't spend a lot of effort on it.

<Content>Quaint and decent Didn't expect a lot from Executive for the price, CAD $115/nt. Was an overnighter but longer stays might want to consider other alternatives it can be noisy for light sleepers. Walls are pretty thin and it is an old hotel after all.Location is quite central and about 10 min away to Pike Place. Another 15 min to Chinatown. And under 10 min away to downtown shopping. Space Needle area will require a cab, but monorail is walking distance. The funky Capitol Hill shouldn't be more than 10 min drive away and some consider it even a walking distance.Parking was included and is in parkade in the building next door.Internet consisted of one computer and getting the chance to get on it is hit and miss... more likely 'miss' unless you get up nice and early.This being Seattle, there was a Starbucks across the street and Seattle's Best Coffee right in the lobby.Overall good value.

<Content>Stay away -small, dirty rooms I have stayed in far better places in Seattle for less. Room was the size of a prison cell, with a window facing a outside wall. It was quiet until someone showered or flushed a toilet. On the plus side a Seattle Best Coffee is next to the lobby and it is right downtown. If you take the hotel's limo expect to pay at least 30% more than a yellow cab. Hotel staff are helpful and friendly.

<Content>Great little spot downtown Stayed at the hotel for 2 nights in Seattle. Found that it was perfect walking distance to most hotspots / tourist places and very convenient. It is an older hotel, but it is kept very clean and the staff were incredibly friendly. Parking is a little steep at $19/day but I guess that is to be expected when staying downtown. Overall it was a very good experience, and I would come back again.

<Content>Filthy, Not Quaint When I walked into the lobby of the Executive Pacific in Seattle, it was filled with young hipsters with ear plates and nose rings and tattoos - yawn - hey, youngsters, as an ex punk-rocker, you should know that all that nonsense hasn't really been shocking since the '80s. Don't worry - we see you.When I saw my room, now THAT was the shocker - old, run down, and most importantly, DIRTY. The grout between the tiles on the bathroom floor was black and mucky. The floor of the shower was filthy with foot dirt. Even the robe hanging in the closet had STAINS running down the front of it! They should be embarrassed at the lack of hygiene in this place - maybe it's alternative to sleep in a filthy bed, but back in the '80s we did that for free, not for $150 a night.I complained at the front desk and was shown an upgrade room which was much bigger, but also had a dirty tub, and a filthy bathroom floor.When I pointed this out to the bellman, he said Well, it's an old building.Pointing to some RECENT black fingerprint smudges on the closet door, I said, Lots of buildings are old - this is a DIRTY building - I could take that off right now with some 409.I got out of there ASAP and found a CLEAN, big room in nearby Issaquah where the walls are thick enough that I don't have to hear my next door neighbor using the toilet (sorry to be gross).AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS UNTIL THEY SANDBLAST THE GRIME.

<Content>Very Cozy Hotel We just returned from a mini getaway and needed someplace to stay in the downtown area for 1 night. We found the desk clerk very helpful in getting us settled and to arrange parking. The rooms are small but quite cozy and the bed was very comfortable. Again the bathroom is quite small but adequate.I would book into this hotel on my next visit to Seattle.

<Content>Positively Awful I was booked in this hotel by a company recruiter and was appalled by the condition of this hotel. I did not mind the room being small but the fact that the carpet was filthy, the dark layer of scum in the bathtub, the mold on the bathroom ceiling, peeling wallpaper, and blackened windows was enough to make me rate this place terrible. I would never stay at any of these establishments again nor would I recommend anyone to stay there. The staff was friendly but when I asked if there was a room that had possibly been renovated more recently I was told they were all done at the same time. Fortunately, I was there for two nights. While I seriously considered changing hotels it wasn't worth the effort for such a short stay.

<Content>Conventient - if all you want is sleep The hotel is located conveniently in downtown Seattle close to the convention center. That description matches quite some others far more recently built ones, but they also go along with a higher price tag. There is no breakfast other than visiting Seattle's Best Coffee in the lobby serving great lattes and some muffins. For a small bite enough, but that's it.The room was clean and primarily filled with the queen-size bed. The bathroom was tiny. Fine if all you want is sleep after a busy day, but certainly no retreat.

<Content>Horrible!!! This hotel is not great by any stretch of the imagination. The only thing it has going for it is the location, which is quite excellent. My main complaint is the noise--to say that the walls are paper-thin is an understatement. I heard everything, I mean everything that went on in surrounding rooms. One night, I couldn't help but overhear the drunk college kids next door as they watched trashy payperview television (the sound effects and explitives I could hear through the walls gave it away), blasted music, and got sick in the bathroom all at 2 am. I had to call the front desk twice before they ever checked on anything. The next night, I was awakened at 1 am to another party going on next door. Again, I called the front desk and they did NOTHING!!! It was very frustrating. My husband and I would have checked out of the hotel and gone somewhere else, but we had already prepaid through Expedia. I've traveled all over the world and generally do not have high expectations for hotels, but this one was nearly unbearable. Even with ear plugs, I was unable to sleep. If you sleep through anything and don't mind parties going on around you constantly, then this is the place for you. Otherwise, I'd find a different hotel.

<Content>Booked another hotel after an hour I booked this hotel because of its location and the website advertised it as newly renovated. However, when we got there it was anything but. The staff was very rude! The woman who checked us in didn't say a word to us. Then we got up to our room, and it just got worst. I requested a room away from the elevator, and we were right next to the elevator. The newly renovated rooms had dirty, dingy floors, the wall paper on the walls was pealing and scatched up, and there was a hole in the wall that had been covered up by a piece of wall paper... they didn't even bother to fill it! The room looked nothing like the picture on the website. Id hate to see what a room that isn't renovated looks like...

<Content>Executive Hotel is a gem This hotel is soooooo beautiful, classy and perfect!Location: 5 stars, I would give it 10 stars if I could! I am actually from a suburb of Bellevue but stayed here with my boyfriend to go to Bumbershoot. There are bus stops everywhere within the one-block circumference of this hotel. Or maybe that's just Seattle's awesome public transportation system. Anyway, the service was also spectacular. The front-desk lady knew EVERYTHING about Seattle and how to get around. Free wireless Internet is also a huge bonus! The room was a little small, but there were only two of us staying there and we like to be close. But for those of you who need space, you may want to go for one of those hotel chain suites.The SBC in the lobby was also super convenient and perfect for breakfast. Oh! And everything is really oldschool, including a very nice doorman who greets everyone by name! Adorable!

<Content>Hated it, website description inaccurate. The absolute only thing this hotel has going for it is its location- right in the downtown core. Upon check-in, we were advised that parking would be an additional charge of $19/day. We were then given a superior room on the top floor and were greeted by a cracked and peeling ceiling, dirty walls and baseboards, and a run down bathroom. We complained to the front desk and were able to switch rooms. The only improvement in the second room was that there was actually a dresser and the ceiling was in better shape. But we took it. Let me restate, the bathroom alone is reason not to stay at this hotel. All of the fixtures were ancient, despite the sites' claims of a recent renovation. The tile was also old and the grout stained. The toilet flush, I'm sure, could be heard two rooms down on either side- it was seriously THAT loud. Plus, it was so small you couldn't close the door until you were actually sitting on the toilet. The counter space (or lack there-of) did not have sufficient space for my make-up bag, and it's hardly a suitcase. The walls were thin and we could easily hear conversations next door, along with our neighbors own plumbing issues. The radiator was not working which sucked because the building was freezing cold.One last thing: this hotel is definitely not handicapped friendly. There are stairs leading from the front desk to the elevator. I'm not handicapped, but it was hard dragging my luggage up a flight of stairs.Because my husband and I were so disappointed, we left a day early and drove back home to Vancouver, BC. Thank you, hotels.ca, for the apology and refund!

<Content>Great location Great location in downtown Seattle within walking distance of Pioneer Square, Pike Place Market, shopping and monorail. Overall, the room was clean, but very small. We had a double/double room and it was very crowded for two people. We had a great holiday rate which is why we booked this hotel and I would stay there again if the price were right.

<Content>Small Room, Bad Service, Good Price We got there to find that the room was smaller then we thought. The batroom was so small and built wierd that I could barely fit in there (Im only 6'2). We asked for a wake up call at 10 am which was never done. all in all, only was $89 for the night and it was about worth $89 a night!

<Content>Just Right I love old buildings and old hotels. Our room was in the corner on the top floor. We are directly across from the fabulous Seattle Public Library, which is a must see. The room is perfectly small and the bathroom is great. We love the old, deep porcelain bathtub with endless hot water. This alone makes me love my room. The one-piece modern sink is stunning and now, I know, I must have one of my own. We walked here from the ferry on Thanksgiving. FYI: If I'd known, I'd choose to go straight up the hill to third or fourth avenue and walk downtown to the hotel that way. I had my young daughter with me and we ended up walking a gauntlet of single, homeless or illegal, men sitting on the pier near the marketplace. It was uncomfortable for both of us, especially pulling our luggage along. It wasn't the highest vibration for sure. In addition, we ate a great Thanksgiving buffet dinner across the street at the Sazerac Restaurant located in the Hotel Monaco. Delicious! It was a lovely way to spend the holiday, for certain. If you like the energy and ambience of old hotels and adore hot baths and excellent customer service then stay at the Executive Hotel Pacific in downtown Seattle. (The free wireless internet is awesome too!)

<Content>Basic hotel with convenient location I was in Seattle for a large conference. Unfortunately, by the time I booked a hotel room all the major hotels near the convention center had no vacancies. The Executive Pacific was the only thing in the vicinity. It was a just a brisk 10-minute walk to the convention center, which I rather enjoyed. Also, on the positive side, there's a good coffee shop (Seattle's Best) right in the hotel. The room was very clean and nicely furnished. The bed was very comfortable. Front desk service was prompt and polite.On the downside, the room was extremely small, not that this fact mattered in my case. The website boasts a 'cardio room,' which is nothing more than three machines (an almost kaput treadmill, bike, andcross-trainer).

<Content>Great hotel!! The hotel is in a great location that was within walking distance to everything! Great shopping, pike market, good restaurants, and the waterfront. Also the area was very safe! We walked around at night with no worries!The hotel is also in the free transit zone, so you can take a bus around downtown for free! We got the queen superior room, and although it wasn't huge it comfortably fit two people and two large suitcases. The rooms were clean and the beds were VERY comfy! The only complaints are that the walls were thin and the elevator was loud. We could hear the people in the room next to us in the morning, but that was manageable. Our room was right across the hall from the elevator, but once we fell asleep you didn't hear it, and the hotel didn't attract a crowd of young partiers who came in really late at night.The staff at check-in (9:00pm) at the front desk, weren't that pleasant, and kind of rude, but the rest of the staff for the remainder of our trip was very cheerful and helpful. A big plus of the hotel is that they held our luggage for the day after we checked out, until we left for the airport, for free!Seattle's Best Coffee in the hotel was great! It made the whole hotel smell wonderful in the morning, and was a great way to get the morning started! The restaurant in the hotel was very good. The sushi was amazing! other great restaurants were steamers which is right on the waterfront, and shuckers which is in the Fairmont Olympic next door. Both of these restaurants had 2-for-1 coupons in the entertainment book, which was an added bonus on top of the amazing food!Although the hotel isn't a stop on any of the airport shuttles, Grayline Shuttle stops at the Fairmont Olympic Hotel, which is not even half a block away! you can pay an extra $5 to get dropped off at the door of the hotel, but you can easily walk from the Fairmont. Also Grayline was alot cheaper than a taxi, and came every 15 minutes which was very convient!All in all the hotel was excellent for the amount that we paid! We were on a tight budget, but wanted to stay somewhere that was clean and comfy and in a safe area, and the Executive Pacific provided everything that we could have wanted! We would definately stay here again, and recommend it to everyone!

<Content>Will stay again, Great Experience! This was an overall great experience. I became discouraged when reading the other reviews, but I believe some were a bit unfair. If you are going to this hotel expecting it to be a 5-star resort, you will be disappointed. I went with my boyfriend from the 10th-12th, and I had an AMAZING stay. Check in was fast, no room mix ups, and it has a very convenient parking garage right next door for only 19$ a night, and you can come and go as you please. We stayed in 402, and it had a terrible view of the backside of the parking garage and the hotel generator, but we didn't get a room for the view. (Hopefully if you are going to Seattle you're not planning on staying in the whole time! That's not what this hotel is for!)WHITE GOOSE-DOWN COMFORTERS. Very clean room, comfortable bed. Flat screen panel TV of good size. We had to call the maintenence man to fix the toilet, but other than that no complications.The hotel is charming, a cute little coffee hosue down stairs, but very thin walls. You can hear a lot, so try to get a room away from the elevators, and we brough a portable DVD player and some movies for at night to help drown out the noise.PERFECT location. 6 blocks away from the mall where you can catch the monorail for 2 bucks and get to the City center/space needle/EMP museum in NO time at all. Only a short, downhill hike to Pike's and the waterfront.For it's location, price, and comfort, it is a steal.I would recommend this hotel if you are easy going and not expecting a 5 star spa. It was perfect for the weekend getaway.

<Content>Bit shaby, but good value This hotel is a bit run down, but it's clean and very conveniently located. Free WiFi Internet! Relatively inexpensive. Unusually efficient desk made check-in and check-out a breeze.Two problems: 1. The two elevators are slow so wait times can be significant. 2. Official check-in time is 4:00 PM, so that a room was not available for a check-in at noon.

<Content>Good location Hotel was well located. Rooms quite cozy and a comfy bed. Bathroom was fine, but as others have said...the toilet flush is really noisy and likely to wake up 'the other half' in the middle of the night.We did find that the door to the adjcent room was really thin, so gotdisturbed one night by next door's antics, but a quick phone call to reception at 3am and it was soon sorted. The only real grip I had was the attitude of the reception desk manager (whose name I forget) but had the charm of a brick. He was neither welcoming or terribly polite and, having just arrived in Seattle from Vancouver, I was shocked and disappointed at the welcometo the city. My tip to the hotel management would be to send this guyon a charm course...or maybe just get somebody else in. Other than that, an OK hotel in a convenient part of town.Cheers!

<Content>Take a bite out of travel? Firstly, I want to express that this hotel was horrible. Our room was match box tiny, you couldn't even breathe, though that was expected because we only paid $120 per night for the room. We were charged an extra $50 dollar parking fee for two nights. It was actually supposed to be $40 but they seemed to tack on an extra $10 for a deposit (Phone and Television were not included, but were probably an extra $50) The room was only worth 100 dollars. We had an executive view of the dirty brick building across from us and we had holes in the walls. Nice huh? Oh yeah and we were basically threatened at the desk. We were told If there is ANY noise or disturbance we will evict you. We were also discriminated against because we were under 21 I feel personally offended that they discriminated agenst us. We are paying customers. A word to the wise, if you are looking for a nice place to stay with nice people, DON'T GO HERE!

<Content>Cozy Rooms, Good Location The hotel is located right near the library, just blocks away from the Pike Street Market, great shopping, and good restaurants. We have stayed in this same area many times for this reason. The Executive Hotel Pacific offered a great rate through their site for a Cozy Queen Room... and it was just that. Small, but very cozy and enough room for the two of us. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Our only complaint was that our room was located right near the elevators, and they are very old and extremely loud. They didn't stop running all night. I would suggest requesting a room away from the elevators, and your stay would be perfect!

<Content>Clean, convenient, fair price We had a 2-night stay in mid-July 2007 and found the hotel convenient (right across the street from the public library - a Rem Koolhass gem!). In the free ride zone, this hotel was just fine. We are 2 NJ teachers who prefer to spend our money on what we see and eat than where we sleep, but we do demand a clean and comfortable hotel. This fit the bill. We liked the free internet on the 2 house computers. Lots of nice restaurants in the immediate area. Convenient to Pioneer Square and within walking distance of (or free bus ride to) the main shopping district and the Monorail to the Space Needle. Nothing fancy, but perfectly adequate!

<Content>Enjoyed Executive Hotel Pacific I stayed in the hotel for 2 nights. The room was clean, small but comfortable, everything worked well, and the staff was all very pleasant. There is a cardio room with an eliptical, bike, and treadmill, that I think is new. I used it and it is small and worked well for my needs. I looked out to the new Seattle Library, which was fantastic. I walked everywhere, but remember that the downtown area is in the free zone' of the Metro, so you can hop on a bus and to to another part of the free zone. And, I had 2 beautifully sunny days in Seattle! A fantastic place!

<Content>Cramped, noisy, and overrated My husband and I just stayed at the hotel in mid-July and had a horrible experience there. Not only was our Superior Queen room incredibly cramped, but the noises from the elevator and other guests' rooms made it nearly impossible to sleep through the night. Also, the hotel promises other amenities such as wireless internet access from the rooms, but it wasn't working while we were there. We felt like we paid too much for this place and it set a sour tone for the beginning of our vacation. After two nights, we cancelled the rest of our stay there and booked at a new hotel.

<Content>best rates The hotel was clean and central to shopping, restaurants,etc. there was a restaurant on the main floor but unfortunately it was reserved that night for a wedding. Just across the street was a great restaurant that served these little shrimp fritters called beignets and really good corn bread, so moist. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel but one thing that wasn't good about it was that we had to park our car in the covered parking area and walk in the alley to get back to the hotel lobby. It seemed inconvenient, they did have valet parking but it cost $25.

<Content>So comfy and super location! This place is fabulous! The room is a little small but coming from NYC that's no biggie (no pun intended)! The bed linens were really nice with a duvet cover and king size pillows. The shower was fantastic and they even provided a bathrobe. I think the one of the best ammenities was the congierge. They provided a colorful map of the city and gave really good tips based on our interests. They even told us the most efficient route to take to see everything we wanted to see. The only thing we weren't crazy about was the parking garage. It was a little bit of a maze. We didn't have to pay, not sure if that was a fluke or if the hotel validates parking. It was safe and right next door though.

<Content>Nice, but small bathroom We stayed in this hotel for two nights and then returned for one more night before leaving Seattle. We had a king size room and it was actually a very large room, but the bathrooms were very small both times. The sink was so tiny the second time with no room to put any toiletries anywhere. Overall the room was clean and had a nice bed and flat-screen TV. There is also some road noise from the street. The parking was $19 a night with in and out privileges. Good location.

<Content>The most comfortable bed! My boyfriend and I stayed here last November, just before Thanksgiving. Not the best time to visit, of course, but i used to live there and wanted to show him what it was like (rain, dark, wind) for me the years I was there. As someone who DID live in seattle, i thought this was the perfect location in between downtown and the financial district, to get a perfect taste of the downtown area. From there, we could walk to Pike Place Market or in the other direction to Pioneer Square. Our room faced the gorgeous architecture of the library. Our room was extemely cozy, but we got a good deal on a package so it was worth every penny. If i'd paid a lot for the room, i would be less pleased. Our room had a door (locked of course) connecting it to another room. The people in the other room were quite loud. And we're not fussy people that need silence or anything. But through the door we could hear them talking and what seemed like a dozen babies of different ages crying and babbling. Not very romantic. BUT! We loved the bed! It was so comfortable, we were inspired to take many naps and someday have a bed just like it in our own house. The linens were amazing, as were the pillows. I would definitely go back to this hotel, and plan to, in a more sunny time of year. Nice that there was a Seattle's Best Coffee shop connected to the lobby.

<Content>clean but loud The rooms in this hotel are small, but clean. The staff was courteous, but not helpful. I have three complaints.My room was very noisy. I could hear the pipes rattling all night when people ran water or flushed the toilet. And I could hear the people in the next room dragging their hangers across the clothes rods in the closet. These noises made it really hard to sleep and I am not a light sleeper. I think a light sleeper wouldn't get a wink of sleep in this hotel.Although the front desk staff was very nice when I asked her to send a fax, she didn't actually send it. I didn't learn that she never sent the fax until I returned home--three days after I thought my fax had been sent.I asked the front desk to send up a bottle of hair conditioner. The person sent up a PARTIALLY USED bottle of the same conditioning shampoo I already had. That grossed me out.

<Content>Not designed for business I stayed 2 nights at the Executive while in Seattle on business. The rooms are small but that was to be expected as it is a boutique hotel. I was not prepared for the size of the bathroom, however. I literally had to step into the stall shower to close the door. My room was obviously part of a suite at one time as there was a door to the adjoining room (blocked by a large TV) through which I could hear every word of the conversations my neighbors were having. The hotel offers free wireless which is nice but no desk on which to work. The bed was amazing, however. Very comfortable. Nice pillows. Great down comforter. And the air conditioning worked quite well too. Seattle's Best coffee house in the lobby was a great bonus. Plus you can't beat the location for the price.If these were my only complaints, I would stay here again. After all, you do sacrifice some amenities for price and charm. However, these are minor compared to the quality of the service I received at this hotel. I should have been prepared for poor service since, when I called to confirm a late arrival, they answered the phone with a plain hello instead of announcing the hotel. I arrived at 11:00 pm and neither one of the 2 young men behind the counter moved to hold the door or help me with my bags. The lobby is a few steps up from the elevator and, after checking in, neither of them moved to help me get my bags down the stairs either. They literally stood behind the desk and watched me struggle with them. The housekeeping staff was not much better. The room looked like it had been just neatened, not cleaned. The in room coffee pot was not washed out. The carpet was not vacuumed. Hopefully the owner of this hotel will read this review and shape up his staff.

<Content>not bad place this hotel is in a fairly convenient location. The rooms are average but kept clean and tidy. The staff were the best part of the hotel - friendly, enthusiastic and helpfulthe rooms were a bit noisy though - a lot of noise leakage from neighbouring rooms, and the toilet flush is like an airplane's - very noisy and could hear flushing from neighbour's rooms!

<Content>Perfectly Acceptable My husband  I stayed at this hotel 2 days before Christmas in a Superior Queen Room. The room's size was perfect -- chair by the window, large armoir w/TV that had 3 drawers for your stuff, queen bed and nightstand on each side. Bathroom was very small, but adequate. Everything was clean and the bed had great pillows and a wonderful down comforter -- very comfortable! We booked online and, luckily, printed out our confirmation w/room rate. Had to show this to the manager in order to get that room rate. Other than that, we had no complaints. Old hotel -- quite charming -- location is GREAT -- close to everything! Parking is available in garage next door for $19/day.

<Content>Icky The front desk staff was rude. At first I was checked into a room that smelled like cigarettes and cheap perfume.Next to the room number was a no smoking sign. I called down to the front desk to switch rooms and they told me the hotel didn't do that and I was staying on the smoking floor. So I tried to air out the rancid room but the window would fall down whenever you opened it. SO.... I finally went down to the front desk to tell them the room was unacceptable and they told me to call expedia and try to get a refund. I did and expedia told me to make sure the hotel manager wouldn't foot the bill. At this point the front desk was tired of seeing me and gave me a better room.... 2 hours later. In the morning a false fire alarm went off and I was forced to stand outside for an hour I then asked for a late checkout and they said get out by noon. So needless to say the wost hotel.

<Content>Small but fine Really really really small room but old buildings like this are often small. They have two computers for guest use and Wi-Fi in a nice sitting room/business area. Parking costs about $8 per day in covered garage next door. Good location for shopping and waterfront. Loved Elliotts Waterfront restaurant and The Brooklyn Restaurant. Loved Nordstroms! Had a great time in Seattle.

<Content>Great location, close to everything We recently stayed at the hotel for a two day getaway and were quite happy with the place. The room was small but clean and had updated decor. We did not have a chance to eat at the restaurant, but it was trendy  the menu looked quite good. The hotel has a fantastic location, especially since we were doing the tourist thing, and walked all over the downtown area. It was 10 minutes to Pike Place market, the monorail, and to Pioneer Square (lots of street people). Since it's an old building the room was a little noisy during the night (doors slamming, pipes running, etc.) so if you're a light sleeper bring earplugs. The internet in the lobby was spotty and quite slow, so don't expect to do any work there. Service was very good  we liked that Seattle's Best coffee shop was just off the lobby.

<Content>So-so The hotel was barely ok- the location was terrific. When you enter the lobby, you either have to go down or up a flight of stairs to get to the elevator - not handicapped friendly, for sure. Also, the room was very small, dingy, with a non-working air conditioner. It usually isn't required in Seattle, but on 2 of the days we were there, we sure could have used it. The bathroom was small, could not accomodate my toiletries. The toilet lid did not stay up by itself - so it was quite an inconvenience for my traveling companion (male) and had to be held up with one hand. It wasn't something that could easily be fixed, because there was a ledge built in over it that was obviously not measured correctly. When the window was open, the bathroom door did not stay closed (painted over too many times), so we had to wedge a washcloth in the door. The bedspread was very old and cheap-looking, like something out of a cheap motel. The carpets were in bad shape, too. My pillow was lumpy - and only one per person. I had to ask for more - got them the next day, after a second request. The help was nice, as were the housekeepers. The location made it tolerable, but without some serious interior renovations, I would not choose this hotel again.

<Content>Wonder pet friendly Great hotel for pets and centrally located. Rooms was very clean and comfortable with beautiful new duvet and new air conditoning we could control. Plus the windows open so you can get some fresh air. Staff loved our little poople and we found the price and location just unbeatable. The hotel is historic in nature but everything was recently upgraded and we had just a marvelous stay. The new valet parking is a bonus we have stayed before and this is a great improvement. Recommend the bigger queen or king rooms as they are terrific. Free busienss center made email's so easy and open 24 hours. Hard to beat that.

<Content>Worst Ever!! This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, in my life! It was disgusting, dark and dirty. The rooms are like closets. The carpet was awful. There were stains on the comforter. There was an electric radiator in the room. I couldn't wait until sunrise to check out of there. I wouldn't recommend anyone staying here if your looking for RR.

<Content>Executive Pacific to be avoided and beware the confusion with Pacific Plaza We booked this hotel and were confused when we arrived as it did not seem to be as the website indicated. The name is so similar to the Pacific Plaza and Tripadvisor do not differentiate as the confusing travellers reports indicate. The Executive Pacific Hotel is meant to be a boutique hotel. It is overpriced and shabby. The rooms are tiny and the room service dreadful. There is no bar or dining facilities. There is a coffee shop at ground floor and a japanese restaurant next door. I complained my phone was not working on arrival and 4 days later they fixed it and no apology. I had messages waiting from my arrival date and they had done nothing. . The public space is split level and simple. The experience was unexciting and all in all it was a big dissappointment. There are better places to stay and we walked passed many of them during our stay.

<Content>ambivalent The location is good and the price is hard to beat for downtown. From the 6th floor the traffic noise is low enough not to unduly disturb your sleep. The bathrooms were very clean. The high speed internet was free.That being said:1) The pillows on the bed were stinky, as if many sweaty heads had lain on them.2) The heads were probably sweaty because the thermostat was broken and all you could get was OFF or REALLY HOT. Fortunately the weather was mild enough that OFF was an acceptable option since no one was willing to do anything about it. Which makes sense since the entire 6th floor seemed to be thusly afflicted (a sampling of 3 rooms).Finally, I'm curious as to how disabled people might access the rooms as I don't think you can get to an elevator w/o dealing with stairs.

<Content>Don't go there Executive Pacific Plaza Hotel, Downtown Seattle.I would not recommend this hotel to anybody as the basic hygene conditions were also not met. On checking in and visiting the washroom, the toilet had urine in it. The towel had shaved hair on it.The bath tub did not drain and I was forced to be partially submerged in dirty water while taking a shower.Try and find another place, any other place but not this.

<Content>Not a bad little hotel Stayed at the Pacific Plaza hotel for a conference in mid-January 2006. Had a room with 2 double beds, clean and freshly painted. Room is small, but was adequate for our needs. Bathroom is freshly tiled and has a small sink. Hotel staff is very friendly and accomodating. Coffee shop downstairs was handy for a.m. brew. Would recommend this hotel for people who want a centrally located hotel for a decent price.

<Content>A great experience! We had 2 nights in this hotel in September before taking an Alaskan cruise and the experience couldn't have been better. An older, moderately-priced hotel, but a better standard of accommodation than we were expecting for the price. The room was spacious, with a king bed, and very comfortable. No view, but we didn't pick the hotel for that.A friendly, relaxed atmosphere. Not as formal as other hotels we stayed in on our holiday, but perfect for this hotel. And absolute top marks to the Concierge, Zach. A welcoming and helpful presence at the front of the hotel. Always ready to ask what our plans were as we headed out sightseeing (and to make suggestions of things to see) and to ask how the day had been as we returned, tired and footsore.But he went further than that. We flew from New Zealand to San Francisco, then on to Seattle, and United managed to leave one bag behind in San Fran. We sorted it out at the airport and were assured it would be sent on the next available flight and delivered to the hotel. That was at 2pm. By about 8pm my wife realised that her insulin was in the missing bag. I went down to reception to ask if there was a way of ringing United at the airline's expense. The receptionist was rather vague, but Zach came over to ask what was wrong, then took over. By then United's normal offices were closed and weren't answering their phone at the airport either. But Zach somehow tracked down a United supervisor and stressed the urgency of the matter. He followed this up twice more before his shift ended at 10pm. The bag was finally delivered to our room at 2am, but Zach's efforts went way beyond what we expected. Since returning home we have contacted the hotel manager and expressed our great appreciation of Zach's assistance.Back to the hotel. A handy location - easy walking to downtown, waterfront, Pioneer Square. The return trip, up some of those steep streets can be tiring though. And having a Seattle's Best attached to the hotel is wonderful as well - those hot caramel apple ciders!!! Who needs Starbucks?Seattle's a lovely city and we want to return to spend longer. And our first stop will be this hotel. We would only look elsewhere if they happened to be fully booked.

<Content>All and all disappointing! Approximately three weeks ago, my husband, our dog and myself were repeat guests at the Executive Pacific Plaza Hotel for a quick business trip. Just the month prior we had stayed there for 5-days along with my father for my son's graduation and had a great time. The majority of the staff was quite friendly and inviting. The price was very affordable, the rooms were nice and the location was amazing for our needs. The only challenge I encountered was when I reserved the room and asked the very nice reservationists that confirmation be directed via e-mail so I could forward my fathers for his itinerary as he was traveling up from California. I was assured this would occur, it did not. For the most part the experience was great; so I had been talking up this property with is affordability and location. When I needed to return for business, I again selected this property due to the positive experience three weeks prior. Although, this time I booked my reservation on-line through a third party so that I would immediately receive a confirmation as well as itinerary for my travels and that is exactly what occurred. I called the property in advance to confirm arrangements and informed them that we would be bringing our dog again. They confirm acknowledgement. Upon arriving at the property, I mentioned that we were returning after just three weeks of our previous visit, of which was acknowledged. We were assigned our room, which when we entered we were not quite so impressed. The room was located in a wing of the hotel, where at the end of the hallway there were four rooms clustered and there were hand written signs on the room doors around ours stating that they were painting. It was located on the same floor as our previous room, although rather than a king bed there was a queen. The room was very small and cramped with a view of all of the back of the house workings and systems, although we would not be staying long so this was not a big issue. From the time we checked in until I needed to leave for my event at 5:00pm, there was the sound of possibly a paint sprayer, which did not cause too much discomfort. We returned back at the hotel at approximately 11:30pm, very tired from a total of 4-days of travel and early to late events. We slept just fine until promptly at 7:47am we were awaken by the sounds of staff yelling back and forth to each other. This stopped for about 50 minutes until it again began. We decided it was time to pack up and leave anyway, so no big deal (I guess?). My husband took the dog out for a walk and then to put her in the car while I continued to prepare for our departure. He came back to tell me that when he went back to our car, he found that it had been broken into. He contacted the garage attendant and was told that it was a 17 level garage and this happens all the time. This is the only offered parking by the hotel. At this point, weighing out the entire experience in such a limited stay, I was now feeling quite disappointed and decided to share my experience with management. So upon check out I asked the very nice front desk attendant if I could speak with a manager in regards to my experience and she stated that she was the Front Desk Supervisor and did I wish to speak with the General Manager. I told her I was comfortable speaking with her if she was comfortable with that and she then could share with her GM. She said yes. I went on to explain my entire experience, of which she empathized and then I added that it appeared apparent to me that I was penalized by booking through a third party with the room assignment and even when the opportunity was raised to upgrade me, no one chose to and I was quite confident their hotel was not at 100% occupancy. I also stated that they new there would be construction noise and that they could have given me the option of whether I would or would not be bothered by it in advance. She did not argue these facts. She offered to credit the parking charge and said that she would have credited my room night charge, but that I had already paid????? That was just insult to injury at that point. I do have to say that after all was said and done we were treated better by the parking garage management, who graciously offered to vacuum out all of the glass in our car from the window the thief broke at no charge, so that we could let our dog inI have been in the hotel management business for the past 10-years and believe I have an understanding point of view, although all and all, I have never have my patronage so unappreciated.The hotel has so much potential and I understand that it just recently changed ownership/management in July. But they need to remember that they just need to make people feel special and that goes a long way to the guest experience, regardless of the things that are out of their direct control.It has now been three weeks and I have not had any follow-up from the hotel. All and all, my experience was disappointing!

<Content>Best Location - Nice Clean Hotel - Low Price! If you are traveling on a budget and want the best location and the nicest room possible for around a $100, this is the place. It is an older, but well maintained hotel, that is within walking distance of Pike's Place Market (about 1/2 mile one way). It is located across the street from the new Seattle Central Library. You can park your car and not use it again until you are ready to check out. An advantage in a city that has serious traffic and parking problems.The competition in this price range is mostly cheap hotel chains such as Comfort Inn that are mostly located on freeway onramps, where you need to drive to everything.Note: The Pacific Plaza Hotel does not have its own parking lot but does have an agreement with the attached parking garage for a discount price for its customers ($18 per day as of 10/05).

<Content>Good price. Good location. We couldn't find a better price, and we tried Priceline (several months later my friend went to Seattle through Priceline for about $70 and stayed an equally good location at nicer hotel).The hotel is not what I am used to, but I think it was perfectly fine. Nothing bothered me. The entrance is more like a side door on the street (not prominent) and the front desk appears somewhat more informal than I usually find. All in all it was a fine experience. The staff was helpful and very polite. The parking was not bad at all. But in general you certainly don't get the feeling that you are spoiling yourself. The location was definitely very good. Easy to walk to everything, but not much around for the first 5 minutes in any direction - which is not a big deal, but things are not right outside your door (except the library which I hear is very nice - we didn't go).

<Content>Great Deal, Cute Rooms, Perfect for a Quick Getaway! This hotel is in a great location and the rooms are very cute. Boutique style hotel with great staff and has a coffee shop on site (Seattles Best I think??). I have sent many friends from Victoria to stay here and they have all loved it. This hotel is my first choice for business or pleasure travel to Seattle as they always offer such a great deal! Keep up the good work!

<Content>OK for a night or two Relatively cheap by downtown standards, the PP offers little more than a place to sleep -- and without AC, not sleep well when daytime temps soar. There are fans in the rooms, but they can do nothing about the humidity. Numerous air purifyers operating throughout the hallways don't quite get the musty smell out. I've seen bigger bathrooms on cruise ships, but at least you need not worry about falling down -- there's no room to do it.While I'm sure the bellhop would help with bags, the elevator doesn't stop at ground level -- you either carry your luggage down about 20 steps or up 10 steps. (I don't think wheel chairs could be accom- modated -- check with hotel,)You decide if it's worth $100/night more for amenites lacking in this older but adequate facility. Seattle's Best Coffee Shop on site with good coffee and bakery items. Walk to many downtown sites and restaurants or ride the 'free zone' busses in the downtown area. I initially was going to give this 2 stars, but in reviewing the plusses -- location, price and friendly staff -- I elevated my rating.

<Content>Good News/ Bad News We were in Seattle just one night and opted for location and price over lack of air conditioning -- but our room was quite uncomfortably warm, even with the large screened window and both a ceiling and bureau fan going full speed. Location is prime -- we walked right across the street and had a wonderful tour of the Seattle Library, then walked down the street to the Pike Market and up the street to the Frye Museum. Staff very pleasant. Room was also pretty small for the three of us (adult couple and teenage daughter). Coffee shop in the lobby was good for quick continental breakfast.

<Content>No A/C and it's hot! While the room was satisfactory and the location is great, if it is warm, there is no A/C, requiring you to sleep with the window open and it is noisy--that is if the window will stay open--we had to prop it open with the trash can. While they don't lie about the A/C on their website, they also don't tell you they don't have it--I should have checked this site first. They do supple a fan but it's just pushing hot air.The bathroom looked fine--updated--but the sink took 15 minutes to drain. When the front desk was called, they indicated they would send someone up but they never did. When I went to use the electrical outlet by the bed, the plug would just fall out of the outlet--apparently their is no electrical connection behind the face plate. Again the location is great but for only $17/ night more, I could have stayed in another hotel only 5 blocks from here on Pioneer Square--it has A/C, in room wireless internet, and a continental breakfast....if I had only known that a newly renovated hotel would not have A/C.

<Content>Non-smoking hotel!! Yes!! :-) It's been 6 months since we stayed in this hotel over the Xmas season but I just wanted to say how much we enjoyed our stay here. Yes, late but still, I'm sure things don't change that much. We were apprehensive about the hotel before arrival from reading about it and the fact that it is a very old hotel in the downtown area. I was nervous that it would be in skid-row. Heehee. It wasn't. It was great that way. What sold us was that it is a completely NON-SMOKING hotel! YES! That did it. When we arrived, the room was small and seemed old but it was very clean. It could use more light. The washroom is very tiny like everyone says. Still, the location is GREAT and the room was very quiet. We faced the library, away from the main street. We enjoyed the easy access to everything so much that we left the car parked in the parking lot for 4 days. Yes, it did cost $18 a day to park. Ouch. The lobby/mezzanine area was actually bright, large and inviting. It was more contemporary and newer with sofa/reading area and free internet computers. Still, we loved our little cubby-hole and would definitely stay there again! It isn't a 4-star hotel but we were open minded enough to enjoy the old world charm. It's CLEAN and feels very safe. Those are the things that are important and oh... the price was good too. About $70ish a night. -Mae

<Content>More than adequate. Only real concern was lack of a/c in rooms. Temp was in the 60's the week I was there, so that was not a problem. Each room has a ceiling fan and a small oscillating fan.Two colleagues and myself were in Seattle for business meetings at the W, but we stayed at the Plaza. It is literally 'next door to the W, at 1/3 the price. Rooms are small, older, but very clean. Beds were great. My wife came to town the day the conference ended and we stayed 3 more nights at the Plaza. If my experience for the first three nights had been unsatisfactory, we wouldn't have stayed the rest of the week. If you just want a place to sleep and shower, it can't be beat.

<Content>One small step above youth hostel We booked our room after reading a review that said this hotel was European style. Having spent considerable time in Europe, we were very disappointed in the size of the room--very small; the esthetics--dreary, old, depressing, and noisy; and the price, which we felt was really ridiculous for this room. We had just come from Little America in Salt Lake City, which could account for our disappointment. The only positives I can find are the location--great--and the desk staff--very helpful. It seems that the hotel's location gives them the right to offer a very substandard experience. After reading the reviews since we stayed there, it doesn't sound like any changes for the better have been made.

<Content>Small, but good value I spent four nights at the Pacific Plaza, and while I was not overly impressed with my hotel room, it was perfectly adequate for what I needed. I found the bed to be quite comfortable, even if the three pillows were small and a bit squished. The room contained a queen-sized bed, a large upholstered chair, a medium dresser and a large television set. The bathroom was small but very clean, and fresh towels and soap were provided every day. I was very happy with this hotel for the price that I paid. I enjoyed the coffee shop on the main level, and the visitor lobby (complete with free internet acessible computers) was wonderful. The staff were friendly, as were the majority of the guests. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>well, it was relatively inexpensive The hotels in that part of downtown Seattle do usually run quite a bit more, so if you are on a tight budget, a deep sleeper and don't plan to spend much time in your room, this is an option for you. Yes, the room was small - I've actually been in smaller rooms in San Francisco (at a lower price). It was not grossly dirty, but not really up to the average hotel standard. I suspect the cleaning staff is not given much time. There was no bell staff - the person at the desk only appeared after you approached the counter and seemed to be a bit confused when you ask questions. The mattress was very hard and lumpy, and the pillows were the absolute worst. They did give me a softer pillow when I asked, and they did bring up some regular coffee when I called (the second morning I only had decaf available). But the walls are paper thin, and you can hear every single car that is traveling on 5th street if you are on that side - and everything that your neighbors are watching on TV, and their laughter, loud comments, etc. At least they can hear YOU when you knock on the wall!I wonder how they get around the Handicap Accessable laws - from the lobby (and from the Seattle's Best coffee shop) you can only get to the elevators using a small set of stairs. The staff was friendly, but they only respond to questions, they do not offer solutions. Also, if you drive there, it is a bit confusing as to where you can put your car while you check in - the sign in front says taxi zone only. If you are sensitive to cigarette smoke, walk through the door quickly - the four times I went through that door, there was something burning in the ashtray which is directly adjacent to the door.This was a business trip, and it was very convenient to our Seattle office. My boss stays there when he goes to Seattle and said it was a good hotel, but personally, I am (apparently) a much lighter sleeper and I will not be returning. I would rather stay further away and walk those steep hills than try to function on so little sleep.

<Content>Love that Pacific Plaza Hotel We get to enjoy Pacific Plaza Hotel, Seattle, Washginton at least once a year when we go to Seattle in March. (which is not enough). It is a wonderful place to stay. They are very accommodating and courteous. The location of the hotel is wonderful. Great place, great prices, great people!! Once you go, you won't go any place else. Enjoy your stay!!

<Content>Bit of a let down My husband and I stayed at this hate for the weekend of 4th - 7th Feb 2005. I booked the hotel some time ago, before some of the negative comments so upon re-checking the website before I set off I was a little apprehensive about what to expect. We arrived late and were greeted by a rather unfriendly bellboy, not the end of the world but certainly a long way of a warm welcome. Our room was fine, we鈥檇 been upgraded to a king and it was fairly comfortable. In the morning however I noticed that the bathroom hadn鈥檛 really been cleaned all that well. I would stay the standard of cleanliness was debatable, not too bad though if you鈥檙e not fussy.Having been out and about all day my husband and I returned ot the room around 4pm, and it was a cold inside as it was outside. I check with reception nd they said that they have to turn the heating off during the day to prevent the system from overheating! What! Heating came back on at 8pm.Another point to note was that the walls are very very thin. Our neighbours were watching Bridgett Jones; we managed to hear every word, given that I鈥檇 seen the film before I wasn鈥檛 so excited about hearing it again at 11pm. On a positive the location was great. The hotel cost $89 a night (booked directly 鈥?no breakfast) although I did notice Expedia had rooms going for $79 a night. We didn鈥檛鈥?spend an awful lot of time in the hotel, I do think you get what you pay for, nothing more nothing less.

<Content>You Get What You Pay For Ok, so this hotel is inexpensive for Seattle city centre, but we think that cleanliness should be included in the price! We switched rooms as the bathroom was definitely cruddy and the bed sheets looked and smelled like they had been slept in and just smoothed over. The front desk gave us another room with no qualms. Rooms are a bit pokey and ours had a view of the parking lot opposite, but for one night before our flight the next day, it sufficed. The hotel is well-located for seeing the sights if you don't mind walking, you can get the monorail to the Space Needle just down the street too. The airport shuttle drop-off is a convenient block away. Last word, the breakfast is fine if you're on the go, coffee and danish from Seattle's Best Coffee downstairs.

<Content>Not really worth it My girlfriend and I wanted a nice place to spend New Year's Eve together. We usually stay at the Holiday Inn Express near the Space Needle, but we wanted something nicer. In all honesty, the Holiday Inn Express turned out to be nicer. I was excited to stay at the Pacific Plaza - it looked like a cute little romantic hotel. We got there to discover that parking was around the block (and $18 a day, which would have been fair if the garage was right there) - a long walk to the hotel in cold weather. The room was OLD and TINY. We couldn't both be in the bathroom at the same time. Also, our heat didn't work, and it was freezing. The pillows were the most uncomfortable pillows I've ever slept on (and the following weekend, I stayed at a Motel 6, and the pillows were BETTER there!). Also, we made it clear at time of making the reservation (and I called to confirm a few days before arrival) that we wanted ONE queen (or king) bed. We arrived to find two double beds. I was furious. I tried to switch rooms, but there were no more rooms with one bed. The only pluses were the location (right downtown), and the pet friendly policy. Oh, and they were nice at the front desk, just not very helpful. Next time, we're going back to the Holiday Inn Express!

<Content>Good value in downtown Seattle Stayed for a night 18 december 04 and didn't quite live up to my expectations, but still a decent value overall. Very convenient location downtown, close to shopping. Staff were very accommodating and pleasant to deal with. There was a cozy coffee shop across adjacent to the front desk. The hotel was VERY clean considering it was an 80-year-old building, but the rooms were quite small and ambient noise from the other rooms was quite apparent. beds were clean and comfortable, but the pipes in the building made heaps of noise in the middle of the night. Probably not the best choice if you're a light sleeper, but still a good value right downtown.

<Content>My most horrible hotel experience to date Who are you people who love this hotel? My trip to Seattle was perfect, except for having to stay at this perfectly horrid place. We had a corner suite which was actually a tiny room with hardly enough room to get around the incredibly hard and lumpy bed. The bathroom was so small that we had to take turns at the sink, as two people will not fit in there at the same time unless one person stands in the tub! It was cold the night we stayed, and the heat didn't work. Housekeeping walked into the room at 8 a.m without waiting for us to answer the door, just knocked once and came right in!As for location, it was probably once a charming hotel. It sits up on the hill right across the street from the public library. It's a good 8 or more blocks down to the waterfront, which isn't so bad going down, but it's quite a trek to walk back up--this is not a small hill, it's very steep, so look forward to getting in some cardio during your stay. And pack comfortable shoes, it's at least two miles to the space needle.Don't get roped into the suite with deluxe breakfast deal, either. The deluxe breakfast consists of a small drip coffee and a muffin at the coffee shop downstairs. All in all, including taxes, we paid almost $200 a night for a cup of coffee and a room that rates no better than a Motel 6.For the price, I've had much, much better accomodations. My best suggestion after seeing the area, stay at the Marriott on the waterfront. It's only a few dollars more, just steps from the Pike St. Market, and sits on the water. The rooms are gorgeous (and HUGE!) and it's central to everything. We also had dinner at a place called The Brooklyn. Highly recommend. Stellar service, and amazing food. I truly enjoyed my trip to Seattle, but next time we'll do one thing very differently. STAY AT A BETTER HOTEL!!!!

<Content>Fabulous choice After reading some of these reviews I was quite surprised by how wonderful this hotel really is. It was very clean and neat-- nicely decorated. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room that we had was what I would consider to be an above average size for a big city hotel. I did not find it too hot or too cold. The bathroom may be a problem for some people who are larger because the toliet sits right next to the bathtub. I also enjoyed having Seattle's Best Coffee Shop on the ground floor for breakfast pastries and coffee every morning. The hotel is within a close walk to Pioneer Square, the Piers, Pike Place Market, and Nordstrom, etc. We even walked back from the Space Needle at night and it was not really that bad-- but definitely pack your best walking shoes.

<Content>Dismal, dreary, poor service Dank, dreary, un-airconditioned hotel. This hotel is not horrible, just expect a very run-down, often musty and dank due to the humid air and no air conditioning, and very VERY tiny room hotel. Some rooms are better than others. The first room we had was tiny, with a bathroom you couldn't turn around in! We moved to room 410, which was larger and on a corner - so two windows for cross breeze. If you have to stay at this hotel, try for this room or one above or below it.Problems - housekeeping is inattentive. We had to ask three times for extra pillows, and we got back to our room to find the door wide open (at 6pm at night.) Fortunately, our room door is at the end of the hall hidden from view, but this was intolerable. Management did not seem very concerned.A few good things -- a very helpful bellman, and an adorable french bulldog named ruby.As others have said, this hotel reminds one of a tourist class hotel in western europe.

<Content>Good Deal I found this hotel through tripadvisor.com and my husband and I stayed there July 17-19th. Overall I would recommend this hotel as a good deal. The hotel staff was very accomidating and pleasant. I was first given a non-smoking room that really smelled like smoke, but they switched my room no problem. Yes, the rooms are very small and the bathroom is a bit cramped, but if you plan to hang out a lot Downtown and not be in your room too much, this hotel is perfect. I'm from TX, so even though there wasn't an AC in the room, I was abel to handel the heat at night, but it might be a bit much for others from cooler climates. If you are on a budget but want to stay downtown, this is a great option.

<Content>Hotl but helpful We came for the football game last weekend and Seattle was hot, so therefore so was the hotel. However the lobby was wonderfully cool with new AC installed the day before! The rooms were small but beautifully decorated with new furniture and pictures. What makes this hotel great? The location, price and STAFF!!!Please don't listen to Barry - there is an elevator in the lobby and the hotel is great!

<Content>Beware if it is hot!! I agree with most prior reviews--this hotel has a great downtown location and is cheap for Seattle. However--the building is old, there is no air conditioning, the rooms are very small--reminded me of European cities. If the temperature is 70 or over, you will be very uncomfortable here.Much better bargains can be found in outlying areas if you rent a car--but if you need to be downtown and it is cool this is a cheap good deal.

<Content>What a miserable excuse for a hotel! I cannot believe that I actually spent hard earned money to spend a miserable, hot (no air conditioning), noisy (traffic noise kept me up for hours even though I was dead tired) night in a closet (the bed barely fit) of a room. The elevator barely worked (and it doesn't even go to the lobby -- you have to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the elevator!!!), the hallways were hot and smelly, the furniture was archaic, and the bathroom was probably nice enough in 1950, but in 2004 it's a snake pit. Stay away. Stay far, far away. You are welcome to contact me if I haven't made myself perfectly clear! The name's Barry and the e-mail address is blb417@hotmail.com if you want more info.

<Content>The staff, the hotel and hotel .. it was an excellent experience We stayed here (May 21  22, 2004) which was initally based upon the reviews found on tripadivsors. And let me tell you, it is worth every penny. Below are a couple things I would like to share with all internet readers.#1/ Facility  LocationThis hotel can be found right downtown (walking distance to Mono rail, Pike Place Market  Pioneer Square - all three can be reached even on a slow walk in less than 15 minutes). Now on previous postings some parties had mentioned parking. As far as I am concerned there is no better place than the secure public parkade next door. Yes you'll need to pay $16/ day but it is discounted and there are in and out privileges. There is no better deal downtown. Plus we shouldn't forget when traveling to other large cities, parking generally runs around $20+/ day - so as you can see it's very inexpensive. As for food / beer - 10 minutes away is a really great place McCormick鈥檚 where you can enjoy a great happy hour 7 days a week. Appetizers are only $1.95/ dish and there's lots of beer to chose from. However if you fancy a more classy place a nice sit down restaurant, then you need to still try this place2#/ The engagementOkay now for the main event. Last weekend was a very special moment for myself and now fianc茅 (Andrea). Days prior to arriving in Seattle I had spoke to Daniel Spurgeon - general manager about assisting me setting up our room for a huge surprise that Saturday night. You see it was that night I was going to ask Andrea to marry me. It was unbelievable, Daniel, Michael - the front desk supervisor and his staff were all over it. Talk about service ...Daniel went as far as sourcing out everything from the wine, to the Tulips (which as a rule are out of season now), to placing rose pedals down on whites sheets from the door, to the bed, to up on to the bed. Oh yeak lets not forget, they even threw in a free up grade. To me this is CUSTOMER SERVICE at its finest ..And we thank you all for your effort  support in making this a very memorable weekend.Darryl  Andrea

<Content>A nice, affordable place to stay in downtown Seattle Stayed here last week (April 23-25, 2004) based on reviews we read on Trip Advisor. For the most part, we agree on the posted reviews. The hotel is located centrally downtown right beside the Fairmont and near the W hotels. Parking is right next door at the Fairmont at $16/night (US) in conjunction with this hotel. (Note that parking in downtown Seattle is challenging to find at the best of times. But, street parking is free from 6pm to morning, and completely free Sunday.)The hotel itself was nicely decorated. Certainly not cheap looking. It is an older property, so the walls are thin (you hear the plumbing  street noise) and the radiator generates a lot of heat. But, for a short stay, it's definitely worth it. Just turn on the overhead ceiling fan.The bathrooms are small as indicated in previous reviews. If you're tall, you may have to sit sideways on the throne to accommodate your knees. The sink was the size of a small mixing bowl and water splashes everywhere. Still, it's very clean and housekeeping tends to the property very well.A nice touch was a bowl of apples for the guests. There is also a water cooler. The staff are nice enough, but remember this isn't a 5-star hotel. For example, ask for nearby restaurants and they'll likely point to a restaurant you can see from the front of the hotel. We didn't get much advice on saving on the parking. We walked around and read the meters ourselves, then adapted our driving pattern accordingly. We also asked store merchants where to eat and what to see.Still, it's a safe, clean and in downtown Seattle. If you're looking to save a few bucks on the parking (it can equal the cost of a car rental if you stay 2 nights in the Fairmont lot), stay in Bellevue (the Hyatt is nice) or Lower Queen Ann (see the Mediterranean Inn).Enjoy!

<Content>good deal in the heart of downtown Seattle The Pacific Plaza is a good deal in the heart of downtown Seattle. The rooms are small but nicely decorated and extremely clean. It is comparable to many other landmark hotels with small rooms -- charming and pleasant. Seattle is a fantastic city with not many inexpensive lodging choices. So this makes the Pacific Plaza quite a glorious find. The service was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. I had a great stay at this hotel.

<Content>Great deal, great location. I was traveling alone when I stayed here and it was perfect. Yes, it's small (very much like European hotels), but when you're only sleeping there, who cares? It's charming and unique. Best of all, it's clean. It's within walking distance of everything and the staff is super helpful. While this isn't someplace you'd want to cram a family into, it's a definite good deal for one or two travelers.

<Content>OK, can see why Euros don't mind it Fourth or fifth time to Seattle on business, hadn't stayed here before, decided to try it. My title is not meant to be disparaging, it's just that having traveled Europe a decent amount, it's what you'd expect from a mid-level hotel ... older, smaller rooms and bathrooms (the sink was literally the size of a large mixing bowl), radiators and pipe noise as another reviewer mentioned. Good location for tourists, though, and for those looking for a clean place for a decent price, this would be it. Staff was a little discombobulated but I attribute that to the fact that the lobby is undergoing renovation so they have a temporary setup for the front desk right now. Not sure when lobby completion is expected.

<Content>Very comfortable, excellent location, excellent Price Only stayed for 2 nights in Feb but found the hotel to be extremely comfortable. Room is not a bad size for this style of hotel, recently renovated, and the staff where helpful and nice. For the price this hotel is a bargain and it's location to the centre of the city is brilliant (it's next to the W and one black from the Fairmont Olympic hotel which are 3-4X more expensive). The Seattle's Best coffee shop downstairs is excellent for a pastry and coffee style breakfast. The room is cleaned daily and the bathroom has a shower/bath combination. The bathroom is small but it's perfectly adequate and very clean. It is only 5 minutes walk from the city centre shops, about 10 minutes walk to Pike Place and 10-15 minutes in the other direction down to Pioneer Square. The Airport bus does not stop here, but it does stop at two nearby hotels including the Crowne Plaza 2 blocks away. There's another airport bus stop 1/2 a block away but I can't remember what the hotel name is (I think it might be the back entrance of the Olympic). Otherwise it's about $30 using a cab to the airport. There's coffee making facilities with Seattle's Best brand coffee. The library construction next door is almost complete so the construction noise will be gone soon, not that it bothered me with the window closed. They are using a temporary foyer in the side entrance at the moment, but there are signs saying the new foyer will be finished in a month. The Shuckers restaurant 1 block away in the side of the Olympic hotel on 4th is excellent but expensive. Lots of seafood places down on 1st Ave and cheaper ones on the waterfront. The Fire and Ice bar on 1st Ave do an incredible duck dish. If you've got the time take a trip over the Bainbridge Island and I also found the Underground tour at Pioneer Square to be rather entertaining. If you want a more unique place to stay in Seattle and you have the money, a waterside room at the Edgewater is very cool (3rd floor seems the best), especially when the company pays because it was out of my travel budget.

<Content>Excellent service and comfortable rooms I often stay at the Pacific Plaza Hotel in Seattle when I'm there on business and always find the staff and management very helpful, courteous, and willing to go out of their way to make my stay and my trip the best it can be. I began staying there in 1999 and have enjoyed seeing the owners of the hotel upgrade and maintain this historic landmark in a classic European style. The guest rooms are all newly renovated and while they are not large they are very sheik and comfortable. The hallways were most recently remodeled and they even added meeting rooms. The lobby now has an entrance through Seattle's Best Coffee on 4th street, and on Spring Street, and I understand the whole lobby will be remodeled soon. Parking is next door in the Fairmont garage and is only about $16 if you put it on your room, which allows for in and out privilege - very handy if you are making sales calls in the Seattle area. Across the street is Seattle's new library, quite an impressive site! I've always called direct to the hotel for what I feel is the best deal including breakfast vouchers for Seattle's Best. On my last visit I learned that they had just converted the entire hotel into Seattle's first totally non-smoking hotel! What a great move!

<Content>Great place!!! We were there last week and we loved the location (4th  Spring), right in downtown and near great restaurants and shops. The front desk staff very freindly and very profesional, specially Shayne!!! she is extremly helpful and polite, that hotel has a great employee. She helped me with reservations for restaurants. She maid us feel so special. The room was clean and nice. I work at a hotel in Boston and believe me the service and the hotel in general was excellent. Next time I am in Seattle I will definately stay at this hotel again. Gerardo Escalante and David Morris

<Content>Cheap, clean, old fahsioned place I have been to Seattle twice now and both times have stayed at this hotel. Here's the deal people expecting Seattle glamour, it's a 1920s building that has been updated into a hotel. That means small rooms, small bathrooms. Yes, the pipes make noise when you use the radiator, but the heat is faster and warmer. The walls are thin, because it's an old building. But for the location (if you are younger or just near fit, you can walk to Pike Place, the Museum and all the good eye candy places. Hop on the free bus line (which is 1-2 blocks away so no noise from that.) then take the monorail to the city center. There is a Seattle's Best Coffe built into the bottom of the hotel and lots of place to eat right nearby. I often read reviews here and mostly they are accurate.. I just can never figure out who goes to all these places and STAYS IN THEIR HOTEL??!!! Not I. If you are looking to coop yourself up in massive hotels, this isn't for you. If you are looking for somewhere clean, bug-free, close to attractions and yet safe-- give it a try.

<Content>Could have been better! My name is Brandy Braun. My boyfriend Pablo and I stayed at the Pacific Plaza Hotel on July 27, 2003 in room #215. It was a hot day, and the window wouldn't stay propped up, so I called the front desk to see if there was a trick to it, and they said they would send maintenance to come fix it. A few minutes later, the front desk called and said that maintenance was'nt working that day and asked if we would like another room. As I was talking to her I noticed the ceiling fan, so I said no, that we would be fine staying in that room. After I got off of the phone with her, I tried to turn on the fan, and it did'nt work. I still was'nt upset, because we were leaving the hotel for the rest of the day and I propped the window up with the garbage can so that it would be cool when we got back. When we did get back, I went to the vending machine to buy some water, which was out, so I asked the guy at the front desk where we could get some water, and he said that since the vending machine was out, and the restaurant was closed, that he could'nt do anything for us. I find it hard to believe that there was no drinking water available anywhere in that hotel, and I also find it hard to believe the poor quality of customer service. To top it all off, we were awakened to housekeeping knocking on our door well before check out time. The hotel was decent but the service was'nt worth the money. I would not be submitting this complaint if the guy at the front desk just found us some drinking water. Please e-mail me if you have any questions or comments. Thank you.

<Content>Could be better Just got back from a week in Seattle and loved almost every minute of it. The Pacific Plaza, while a good buy, could use some improvement. We were on the top (8th floor) and all the heat in the builidng seemed to rise into our room. Also, while the room was non-smoking, the internal ventilation system seemed to draw in smoke from other rooms. The staff was very courteous and helpful, and the location is very good.

<Content>The Best deal in Seattle I just stayed in the hotel for the Manchester United Celtic Football match. The staff were wonderful, the room clean, well decorated and very European. The staff were brilliant and made me feel very much at home. The review that said this hotel was on a hill must have realized Seattle is built on 7 hills so from any hotel there is a up or downhill walk - but it is also in the free bus zone and the London Double decker Tour stops right outside. For those of us from the UK and Europe I highly recommend this home away from home! Thank you staff for making my stay so enjoyable!
