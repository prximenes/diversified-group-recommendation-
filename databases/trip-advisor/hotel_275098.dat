<Content>Definitely would recommend Stayed here for two nights on a post-cruise package and we were very satisfied with the accommodations. The room and bath were spotless and comfortable. Don't be afraid of the rooms facing out to the street; you have a lovely view and the double glazed windows block the sound.The staff was attentive and helpful and the location was perfect...would definitely stay here again.

<Content>nice put expensive Hotel Berna is a nice hotel fairly central to Barcelona, in a quiet area.The building looks great from outside with fresco painting, really pretty.Reception turn into these fashionable modern slick looks (not a fan myself) but good and clean look.Staff was ok. Professional not intrusive.Room was very nice, kind of new interior. Well isolated from the possible noises from the boulevard. Bathroom clean.On my last evening there (spent 3 nights) a staff member even came to knock on my door and gave me a chocolate. they did the same to the rest of our group staying there.Breakfast was really really good, lot of choice, tasty and plenty!On the negatives: Internet connection is really expensive.Room rate is fairly high. We got a discount as a group but still high to my eyes (would have been OK if internet connection included).A few bits and pieces to fix (nothing major: TV remote, bath extraction) but I guess it was just my room as the others were ok.Overall a very good stay. Not especially for the travellers that like the personalised contact, introduction to the culture but it was comfortable, safe and again the breakfast had a local colour and was amazing!

<Content>Great location. I really enjoyed staying here.I booked this hotel on [--] for a four day sightseeing trip to Barca. I paid æ‹¢350 for four nights (2 people) including breakfast and taxes.The hotel is in a great location only 5 minutes walk from the best shops in town. Prada, Gucci, Armani etc etc. Placa Catalonia is only 10 mins away too so that was spot on.The hotel itself was good, rooms were not very big but spotless and cleaned everyday. Lovely fresh towels and a superb bath and monsterously powewrful shower.Breakfast was superb and served 7am to 10:30am so good for early risers and those who have a few beers the night before. If you love your tea take some of your own english teabags as those served at breakfast were rubbish. We had the set menu in the restaurant one night and it was really nice. Three courses, including really fresh seafood, water, wine and bread for only 18 Euros each. We both felt it was well worth it.The only critisisms I have is that the room doors slam shut when people arrive/leave. This was particulary annoying at 6am when some people left early. Our door was the same and if you didn't control the door as you left it would slam behaind you due to not having those bracket type things that slowly close most doors.Also when I was there the air conditioning was not working in the room which got quite warm at night. I was told at reception that it does operate at this time of year. (March) I would have liked it on.The hotel is on a busy junction but the traffic noice is completely cancelled out by the double set of windows so this was not a problem.Overall, I would stay again if they sorted out the slamming doors on the 5th floor.

<Content>Great location, clean and good breakfast but noisy and crowded The hotel has a great location (2 blocks from the main shopping street and a few blocks from the central Plaza Catalunya) and a pleasant, elegant check-in area. The room was fairly small but clean and there was a minibar. Breakfast was a buffet (included in our price but generally was 15 euros, I think), with a good selection of breads, meats, cheeses, even some sausages. The staff at the check-in desk was helpful, too.A big PROBLEM, however, was the noise. Nothing is carpeted. We did request a room facing the depressing elevator-shaft-looking inner courtyard, which decreased the noise a bit. However, we could hear every single noise made outside in the corridor and even in the other rooms. It was very difficult to sleep and we were woken up by the maid dragging appliances across the corridor from room to room. Couldn't wait to get out of there for that very reason - after all, if you can't sleep, what's the point of everything else being good? Breakfast staff were loudly banging pots and pans during breakfast, completely ignoring you until you dared pour your own coffee. Then they'd scowl and insist that they do it. That was unpleasant. I tried to toast some bread, which burned because the toaster hadn't been cleaned for ages. A member of the staff rushed over, took away my bread and disappeared without a word. THAT was strange...Overall, I wouldn't recommend the hotel because of the noise but if you've got earplugs, by all means, go there.

<Content>Fantastic Location We have just come back from a wonderful 4 day break staying at the Catalonia Berna. We were a little aprehensive after reading some of the previous reviews, but found our stay to be very enjoyable.The major plus point is location, you are in walking distance of the major tourist attractions metro stations and buses, which really allow you to explore the city. Do go into Gaudi's Casa Mila which is well worth the 8 euro'sWe found the rooms to be spotless, cleaned daily, good size and the staff friendly and efficient. The buffet breakfast was ample and the service was good. Didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening ( does anybody) so can't comment..One point of caution is to try and get a room facing out ward as the the inner rooms can be viewed from the glass lifts as they travel up and down which could be a bit embarassing if you forget to pull the curtains.All in all we spend majority of the holiday exploring the sites and soaking up the atmosphere. The hotel fulfilled it's function to be a pleasant place to leave your suitcase, and return for a good night sleep before setting off again.

<Content>We loved it We loved the hotel and enjoyed our stay very much. The staff were very friendly and made us feel very welcome. The room was very nice and spotless. The buffet breakfast was very impressive and all the staff there were very nice. We ate in the restaurant one night and the food was first class, the only fault was that the restaurant was very quiet but again the staff were lovely.We loved the locaton as it was only a short walk to the centre. We would have no hesitation in recommending the Catalonia Berna to our friends

<Content>Don't stay here The hotel is nice but the bed's are very uncomfortable and the area is very noisy. The staff are not very helpful also, do not get them to book a cab for you as the driver we had tried to rip us off by saying he had been waiting for 15 minutes. When we approached the staff to complain they did nothing to help so we had to put up with the abusive driver!I will definitely not recommend staying here, there are plenty of other hotels in Barcelona with more helpful staff!

<Content>good clean hotel My wife and I have just returned to the U.K. from a four day break at the Catalonia Berna. This hotel is all you could ask for in a short break in Barcelona. The hotel was immaculately clean.Our towels were changed twice daily in our room. The room had a nice FIRM bed which suited us fine as I have a slight back problem.We were on a BB basis and the breakfast was excellant , plenty choice, although they seemed to be training new Fillipino staff for the restuarent and they were a bit slow. We had an evening meal in the hotel one night and it was the best we had during our short stay. (A well done steak in Barcelona has blood dripping as soon as you put your knife in). The hotel is quite central, just off Passaige de Gracia and we walked to the main square, Placa de Catalunya in a few minutes. All in we enjoyed our stay and would definately go back to this hotel if we were reurning to Barcelona.

<Content>Wonderful hotel in a good location. Just returned from a three day break to Barcelona staying at the Catalonia Bernia Hotel. Looks old and historical from the outside with a modern interia.The hotel was within a few minutes walk of the centre e.g. Las Ramblas and we were delighted with the service and hospitality we received. Everywhere in the hotel was beautiful and clean. The rooms were of a good 4* standard and the breakfasts were fantastic! There were fresh, white towels each day and bathrooms were super clean.We certainly were pleased with our stay and if ever we return to the city would be happy to stay there again. P.S. The staff were friendly and helpful too, although one young receptionist did forget to order us a taxi and the one we picked up outside the hotel began taking us to the wrong station making it a more expensive and nail biting journey as we nearly missed our connecting transport. However we feel partly to blame for not speaking Spanish! This was the only minor fault of the entire weekend.Booking 2 day tickets on the Touristica bus certainly let us make the most of the city and we would recommend this if you want to make the most of your stay without walking your legs off.This also allows you to go out for lunch or tapas outside the city centre where good three course lunches can be eaten with wine for 10 euros. These are typically Spanish restaurants where you get a limited choice but excellent quality and value.review from Chesterfield in Derbyshire.

<Content>a nice base from which to explore I stayed at the Catalonia Berna between Christmas and New Year 2005. I had never been to Barcelona before and was looking for a romantic trip to the city with my boyfriend. The Catalonia Berna is in a good location for exploring the city, and we walked everywhere. Breakfast was the usual continental selection, and the restaurant was clean with helpful staff. Our only problem was getting something to eat at night. We never had dinner in the restaurant as it was always closed when we went downstairs (probably because of the time of year), and you must walk to find other restaurants! The room was nice and looked brand new with a lovely marble bathroom. On our first night, water began pouring into our bathroom from upstairs, but the staff dealt with it quickly and we were moved to another room. We didn't have any English T.V. which we missed when we weren't out and about.Overall, it was a great introduction to Barcelona. I loved the city and the hotel but would probably stay closer to the main shops etc. if I was to return.

<Author>Reluctant_Traveller2
<Content>Fair to middling I decided on this hotel partly as a result of reading recomendations on this site. My reason for adding this review was because I seemed to feel differently about this hotel than most. People seemed to love it or loathe it! I on the other hand thought that it was just ok. I do think it's a little expensive for what you get, and rather lacking in character. This being said, it is scrupulously clean, the staff are efficient if not overly welcoming (but no compliants on that front) and the breakfast offers a very good variety of fruits, hams, chesses, yoghurt, tortillas, sausage, bacon etc. My breakfast was included, and I managed to get a drink at the bar on 2 occasions although the bar wasn't patronised by many. All in all we encountered no problems with hotel, it just became clear wandering around Barcelona that there appeared to be much more interesting and cheaper hotels all over the city. This was a last minute booking for me, so all in all it was fine, but I'd advise others to maybe spend a little more time researching hotels than I did. One very strong feature of this hotel is the location which is excellent, one major let down is if you don't get a terrace room (there are very few) there is no outside space in which to just sit and relax.

<Content>Great hotel in Barcelona Super nice and very luxurious hotel in a good location - nice neighborhood within easy walking distance of everything. Underground train stations also nearby. Very nice rooms, clean and quiet, friendly staff and good service. I did not try the restaurant or the breakfast. I would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Nice hotel, nice location We were in Barcelona for a night prior to a cruise, and we stayed at the Catalonia Berna. The property is a clean, modern, comfortable hotel in a good location. The hotel is two blocks from La Rambla, with restaurants and shops close by. The Gaudi cathedral is about six blocks away. The hotel staff was very prefessional and accommodating.We didn't eat at the restaurant, as there were so many nice places to eat close by. Restaurants that were close by and good included Tapas Tapas and the Don Quixote. Barcelona is wonderful, and we intend to go back. And we will stay at the Catalonia Berna again.

<Content>Extortion If you prefer honesty and open-ness alongside polite service and a welcoming atmosphere -go elsewhere. Do not stay here. I booked this hotel, aware of the good reviews and its central location. I particularly specified breakfast in my booking. I paid 'upfront' and on arrival found that I had 'agreed' to room only. Despite presenting emails confirming the arrangement the receptionists were immovable, rude and resolute. They showed me their version of our email exchanges and some of my email sentences had been ommitted e.g. my requests for breakfast at the time of booking. This seemed very suspect and odd. I contacted the booking agency, via whom I had originally booked, who did their best to rectify the situation but the invisible Berna 'management' were immovable apparently. The agency was powerless, embarrassed and could only apologise. The price I unwittingly paid for room only was extortionate for a hotel of this type. Luckily, we found an excellent government (engineering college) managed cafe across the road which sold solid, robust breakfasts in pleasant, real surroundings, within a little garden area to boot. The ambience here was 100% more appealing here than in the Berna dining area. It came to 13 euros for 3 of us- compared to the 13 euros per head charged for breakfast at the Berna.Check your booking agreement very carefully if you are naive enough, as I was, to book this hotel. You are likely to be misled.One particular male receptionist was extremely surely and supercilious in a most unattractive, unwelcoming and almost threatening way - as if we were doing him a favour staying at the hotel (probably were)! You'll know who he is if you've had the misfortune to stay here.Catalonia Berna - over-priced, unaccommodating and completely lacking in any kind of personal charm whatsoever. You will be treated like a number!To be avoided. Search for a fair, trustworthy hotel that welcomes guests instead of tampering with their email bookings and attempting to rip them off (in my case, successfully)

<Content>Really Impressed Stayed in the Catalonia Berna for three nights in February 2004. Extremely impressed with the hotel. Had spent a good while looking around on the internet and ended up going with this hotel. Got a very good deal and was extremely impressed with the location of the hotel. Buffet Breakfast was included in the deal which was great although it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. The hotel is spotless and could not be faulted at all. Staff were very friendly and the breakfast went until 11am which was great not having to get up too early. The only draw back was the hotel bar which I had read about in other comments. We didn't manage to get a drink at it at all. On the first night there didn't seem to be anyone serving and the other two nights it closed really early (before 12). Thought this was poor for a residents bar. Aside from that I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again there.

<Content>Great hotel I agree with most of what the NY reviewer said except I thought the temperature in our room was fine, we stayed there from 17-22 Jan 04 so I dont know what the difference was, maybe us Scots prefer a bit of heat or something!Have to agree that the decor in the hotel is really nice, marble floors in the corridors and hardwood floors in the bedroom.I liked the location, v handy for Passieg de Gracia where both tourist buses routes converge at, and felt like a safe, well to do area. About a 5-10 minute walk from Playa De Cataluny which was goodComplimentary breakfast was really good, proper fruit juice, not the diluted stuff you get in some places.There's a nice little supermarket just across the road too.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at this small boutique hotel (in January) without knowing too much about the hotels in Spain. It is a beautifully designed little hotel and the rooms were very well designed and comfortable. We were given a room with a extremely large balcony on the top floor. It is conveniently 3 blocks north of Placa Catalunya and within walking distance to almost everything. Gaudi's Casa Batllo and Casa Mila is only minutes away on Passieg de Gracia, where you can also catch the metro. There is also a complimentary breakfast buffet that is very good. Our only complaint is that the temperature in the room was alittle hot and there was seemingly no way to turn off the heat. We just opened a window. Otherwise it was great. We highly recommend it.

<Content>Dreadful after-service We stayed at the Catalonia Berna in October for 3 nights and whilst the service of the hotel was excellent during our stay, the after service had a lot to be desired. I left an item in the room and when i called to ask if they would forward it on to me - they refused, so i offered to send them a cheque for postage - they refused, i then had to book a courier to pick the item up so i rang the hotel to ask if they would weight the item as the courier needed to know - they refused. Lastly i asked if they could at least put it in an envelop and put my name and address on it - they refused. Its a nice hotel, with a great location and fabulous breakfast but if you are going to stay here - just make sure you leave nothing behind as once you leave - they don't want to know
