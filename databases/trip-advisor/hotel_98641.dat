<Content>Nice stay, great shopping location This was a nice hotel. The lobby was quiet, and the staff was very friendly. The beds were comfortable.This was great hotel for shopping. They offer a free shuttle to the Galleria Mall on the hour. It is also near ValleyView Mall and was about a 10 minute drive to North Park Mall.The room was clean, but the bathroom was in need of an update. The finish on the tub was worn, but was in fair condition. I only mention it because so many hotels now have awesome bathrooms.We booked the bed and breakfast package. The breakfast buffet was at Crockett's on the pool level. It was amazing! The food was good and the service was perfect. They had standard breakfast items, and a cook to prepare omelets or eggs any style.I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>functional for business Arrival: Front desk is efficient and helpful.Room: A bit long in the tooth. Rooms on the highway side can be noisy but larger. The back side rooms are smaller but reasonable and quiet (if a university sports team is not on your floor...)The TV's, even on the exec floors need to be updated to flat panels.My room also had a fridge. The bath is small and showed assorted water damage and rust was visible.Staff:I never got room service, but $3.00 delivery charge plus 18% tip seemed a bit much for a glass of juice and a toast.The staff in the executive lounge was great in the evening. Ask for Dallas dining advise.Housekeeping and turn down service was unreliable.Food:Service in the one eating place I visited was terrible, my drink tasted like the bar rag and the food was marginal.Other amenities: Pool - too cold in December. Workout room is minimal. Parking is expensive and a long walk.The lobby and common areas are attractive.Checkout : Fast and easy my bill was accurate the morning of departure.

<Content>Friendly Staff We had the opportunity to meet the person who just might be the friendliest hotel staffer you'll ever meet. Jaki who worked the executive lounge the days we were there is in a catagory of here own. Greeting guest with a smile and positive attitude, she got many compliments from the guest in the lounge. If you picked up a roll or bread item she was right there to ask if she could warm it for you, if you brought breakfast items to the table and she noticed you didn't pick up a spoon she was right behind you with one (I saw this happen a couple times). If the crowd got large and she came close to getting overwhelmed taking care of them all she would hurry about telling you how blessed she is to have this many guests in the lounge. Truely a wonder, any service industry would love to have a Jaki. As you can infer, we stayed on the executive level and unless she rotates around this would limit how many guests would get to interact with her, but those that do I am sure will admire her and enjoy the experience.Although not at the way above the call of duty level that Jaki had set, all the other employees we came in contact with including the front desk, bellman and car valet were all pleasent and cheerful also.

<Content>Unfriendly front desk employees The room and other facilities in this hotel were nice. I found the parking attendants and other workers helpful. The problem I encountered was with 2 of the women who worked the front desk. When I had a question about my bill, which I communicated very calmly, the first woman I spoke with was difficult. She was not willing to discuss my question and was very abrupt in her response. When I asked to talk to the manager, another woman came over (not the manager) and was equally unhelpful. She sent me to talk to another employee, who was very considerate and cleared up the problem immediately. He also called the front desk, in my presence, and explained the situation. When I went back to the front desk for an amended bill, the same 2 women refused, saying they did not receive a phone call. (Basically, accusing me of lying.) Instead of asking around, they just kept refusing to print the amended bill. Finally, another worker overheard them and came over. She told them she had received the phone call and everything was fine. For a hotel of this caliber, I would have expected more graciousness and hospitality from the front desk. There are many hotel choices in Dallas, and I will not be choosing this one again on my next stay.

<Content>Priceline customers's gets the bad room Hotel looks very attractive mostly for business travelers.The room they provide to priceline customer is run-down, quite bad - this I have experienced in several hotels.The faucets were making loud noise, in middle of night the flush broke and started making noise - even I could not shut off the water as the shut-off line was very tight-jammed, I didn鈥檛 wanted to call a repair person in middle of night so somehow we managed to sleep and woke with head-ache - went to the front desk to compliant about all this - they did not took it seriously.I asked for feedback form and they were out of those.Also why do they charge customers for self-parking?Room they provide to priceline customer is run-down, quite bad

<Content>Favorite Hotel in Dallas I've grown up traveling to Dallas very often, and this hotel has been a long favorite of my family. Now, I travel to Dallas at least once per year for business. I've stayed at many hotels in Dallas with my company, but this hotel is my favorite - especially for shopping trips. The hotel has a free shuttle to the Galleria that leaves every hour. This amenity is fabulous! Also, the hotel is relatively close to Northpark Mall and the Highland Park area - which has great restaurants. The rooms are very nice and comfortable. The bedding is typical for a Hilton - crisp white and very soft. I'm a Hilton Honors member, and this hotel is on par with other great Hiltons where I've stayed. The staff are very nice and accomodating. I always prefer this hotel when I travel to Dallas, and I would highly recommend it to others.

<Content>okay hotel It is a typical business oriented hotel: shiny large lobby, conference rooms, posh restaurants, and rather small but okay and clean rooms. Never mind, I enjoyed staying with the family for a couple of nights. The kids loved the spaceous pool. Breakfast buffet was superb. Though I had a bit of a run-in with the waiter when he pointed out that we as a family of four had only two b'fast vouchers. I asked him whether my kids were supposed to starve, or whether two people had to watch the other two eating. I don't know why we had only two vouchers and I wasn't in the mood to make much fuzz about it. Don't get the wrong impression: I was immediately offered the deal that only one extra breakfast was charged and the restaurant staff was very friendly and competent.Overall, I was very satisfied with the hotel.

<Content>Great location, Nice rooms It was a great hotel right by great shopping in Dallas. The room was very large with plenty of room. Nice service and nice breakfast as well. The parking was a little confusing but it wouldn't cause us to not stay here again. If you're headed to the Galleria - this is a nice place!

<Content>Would not recommend because we couldn't get any sleep. I would not recommend this hotel based on 1 thing...the pillows. Neither me or my husband got more than 2 hours of sleep when we stayed at the Hilton Lincoln Centre Galleria. The pillows are very overstuffed. We both like pillows that give some. The pillows at the Hilton stay firm  plump even after you lay on them.Also, the decor in the rooms is very business cookie cutter. The TV's are small too. The location is good though...right across from the Galleria.Also, we only paid $69.00 through Priceline for a Saturday night stay.

<Content>Hilton was nice for a night away from home We live in Dallas but my husband and I wanted a night away from home for our 17th anniversary. I can't complain about the price - $96/night including taxes through Priceline and the hotel is beautiful. Initially we packed in back because we didn't want to pay to park and upon check-in Katie was very helpful and polite yet when she inquired about where we parked she gave us a tag for parking and we were told there was no charge. We were surpised to see that we were charged $10.83 for parking. When we called the front desk the girl proceeded to argue with my husband. Another person at the front desk eventually removed the charge. I understand that there is office buildings next to the Hilton and they do need to charge yet it would have been nice to been given accurate information from the beginning.If you're looking to watch TV there are few channels yet not a huge issue unless you're looking for more than 15-20 channels.The room was beautiful and the bedding made it easy to sleep in late. (Even my husband with a bad back was able to sleep.) The room was very clean and comfortable. There was some mildrew and grout issue in the tub area and the tub would not hold water (we had to use a wash cloth over the drain) and other small cosmetic issues but in all it was very nice. I wouldn't consider it bad enough to not recommend staying there again.The pool area was very nice with very comfortable chaise lounges. We did not use the workout facilities but walked through there and it was very nice and appeared to all be in working order.In all it's a great location and once you get there the first time, it's a breeze. The confusion is more due to the street/highway layout than anything the hotel could control. I would stay there again any time.

<Content>Great Place! I stayed here in January for 8 days and just now got around to writing a review because I've been traveling for work as usual. I loved it, and that's pretty much all there is to say.But I'll say more. Upon check-in, a dairk haired female was so polite and used my name several times. She said Welcome back, since I had stayed there once this year and have a Hilton membership. She offered me an upgrade, and a bellman promptly walked me to my room.The room was open and airy. The bed linens were crisp, and I took a nap before my first meeting. I ordered a cesar salad from room service after that, and the agent was also very nice. The food at this place wsa great throughout my stay. One day for breakfast I had the eggs benedict, and it reminded me of a dish I once had in my childhood.Upon checkout, over the phone, the guy asked me how my stay was. Housekeeping was great I said, the staff was all friendly, and my room was comfortable. I didn't want to go back to GA.

<Content>very good experience at this hotel Stayed for 2 nights while touring through Texas. Located to the north of the city but convenient for attractions (if you have a car). we did the JFK museum in downtown Dallas before heading over to Fort Worth Stockyards and then to Southfork Ranch so you can do these attractions in a day from this base. Nice restaurants and other facilities. Excellent well appointed room at very competitive rate. Overall a very good experience and would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good stay My stay was good but not great. Checking in was fast and the staff was very courteous. The lady who checked me in was more chipper than most. Checking out was just as easy. They have an express checkout option where you leave your room keys in your room and call downstairs to say that you are checking out. That's it. No stopping downstairs at the front desk. I thought it was great. The staff knew of some places to go to for dinner and drinks and they were able to suggest a few places. For car parking, you have two options, valet for $16/day or self park for $8/day. They have a garage across the street from the hotel, it's very close so you don't have to walk far. I self parked and it was fine and easy. The hotel room was clean and nice. The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of soft feather pillows to lay on.Now for the negative. Some other hotel guests staying on my floor were very drunk, shouting and fighting in the hall at around 4 am. I was not pleased. Luckily, they stopped after about 5 minutes. The bathroom was kind of gross and had a funny smell. There was mold around the tub and it just seemed unclean, possibly from being old. They should renovate their bathrooms. Next time I'm in Dallas, I'm going to try a different hotel. I'm sure there is a better one.

<Content>I'm glad I got it on Hotwire-Wouldn't pay full price! My hubby  I needed a night away so we decided to use hotwire and see what we got. We were booked into this Hilton. The staff was efficient,however I mentioned to the front desk clerk that it was our anniversary and she didn't even comment or say happy anniversary or anything. She did however efficiently check us in. Our room was on the 16th floor. The hall carpets are old and dated. The room carpet was stained and the bathroom had quite a bit of mold in the shower, covered with caulking. The room was fine for what we paid, however I would never pay full price for this place. The parking was an additional $10 for self park. Our bed was not that comfy. You could tell it was an older mattress and they had not put any padding on it to make it more comfy. I don't know if I would stay here again, however it was sufficient for one night. The restaurant was closed fora private party, so I cannot comment on that, however the lobby is very beautiful and the glass elevators are nice as well.

<Content>Loved the Hotel, hated the pipes My wife and I stayed next door to my brother and his wife on the 9th floor for one night. We were elated with the hotel. The priceline price was great, the location was great, the hotel was great. Everything had met or exceeded our expections. Other than the expensive parking, the one thing that happened that totally ruined our stay was the plumbing. At 5am, the pipes in our bathroom started moaning and creaking LOUDLY and I cannot stress loudly enough here. Now I've heard this before; I knew what it was, but this went on continuously for 2 straight hours. We were trying to ignore it and go back to sleep, but that was impossible. This was our one day to sleep in a little and it totally ruined our stay. I can't say that it happens every morning or even on every floor, but it happened to us and that's the reason I can't give this hotel a better rating.

<Content>Great Hotel Great Price We got a great price on Priceline for this hotel and spent 3 nights here. The room was modern and well equipped with nice furnishings. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet on the 15th floor. Hospitable service all around, from the valet, front desk and the restaurant. We used the valet service when we initially checked in, but then used the outside parking lot for free for the next two days. We checked with the security gaurd prior to parking there to make sure it was allowed, and had no problems. Good location. We would stay again.

<Content>Much improved I feel compelled to write a new review of this property. I wrote a review earlier this year that was highly unfavorable. I had not stayed there in at least six months, despite its supremely convenient location to my business in Dallas, because of (i) rude front desk staff and (ii) poor air conditioning. Much more because of the former than the latter. Well, I finally broke down and stayed there again because I cannot pass up the convenience (it is connected to an office building where I have client meetings). I am happy to say that the front desk staff could not have been nicer, and the room was cool and comfortable when I walked in, despite the 95+ F temps outside. On my next stay, the room was a little warm but cooled down fairly quickly once I turned down the A/C. As usual breakfast buffet was good, but I am staying here now on a regular basis because I feel welcomed at the front desk and not like a nusiance as I did before. Also, I saw no sign of that rude woman who checked me in earlier this year. Hopefully the hotel realized that she was not cut out for the hospitality business. The hotel could use a little renovation, expecially in the bathrooms (and it looks like some rooms have had work and some have not), but all in all I would recommend this as a solid choice for business travelers.

<Content>Never again My friend and I stayed here for one night, and I use that word loosely, in April of 07 and it was a nightmare from beginning to end. The day of our stay I was flying home (to san antonio) from chicago, and got delyed as usual passing through DFW. We knew were would be arriving to the property late so my friend called ahead several times to make sure they did not give our room away. I finally arrived in san antonio around 9PM ran to meet up with my friend and we began the 4+ hour drive up to dallas. We arrived at the hotel at 2:45am only to be met by the rudest front desk person I have ever encountered. She ignored us for a good ten minutes--she was talking to someone when we walked up.. no I'll be right with you nothing. Then she proceeded to help the drunk brides maid and her date before us even though they walked up a good 5 minutes AFTER we did. When she finally did speak to us the first thing out of her mouth was this hotel is sold out. Umm Excuse me, I thought. We kindly explained to her that we had been calling all evening to ensure our room would still be available, she didn't believe us and again said there are no available rooms. Finally, after a good twenty minutes of standing there she found our room, and gave us the keys with a nasty look to go along with. The only saving grace this hotel has is Ms. Jackie who works in the regency club lounge in the mornings. Thank you Ms. Jackie

<Content>Stay here if you enjoy being Nickled  This hotel is beautiful on the outside and throughout. You pay for it too. They charge guests $10 per day for parking. They charge you for wireless Internet Access when you could get it for free at regular hotels and their rates are pure highway robbery. $200.00 is way more than I would ever be willing to spend to be hassled as much as I have been in this hotel.Don't take pictures of anything in or around this hotel because you will be hassled by one of their security people who enjoy making up security policy on the fly. I asked the security person and the front desk staff why I am not allowed to take pictures in or around this hotel and was basically given the run around. First it was for the other guest鈥檚 privacy and the privacy act. Funny, with hundreds of video surveillance cameras photographing my every move while in the hotel; I guess my privacy doesn't count. When the privacy argument didn't hold water they fell back on the because of the world we live in argument, as if we all woke up to a police state after 9-11. I mean, really people. It is private property, and I can understand security practices and the like. However, if you are going to have security polices perhaps you should post them and dare I say, be able to produce them when asked for them by your guests. I can declare myself King of Dallas and decree that everyone else that lives there is trespassing but I doubt that argument will hold any validity.Oh, by the way. If you like paying tolls for roadways your tax dollars have already purchased you should really stay in Dallas. Dallas Texas is the Mecca of Toll Roads.

<Content>Very good hotel, great beds but watch out for the extra cost of parking Very good hotel. The other reviews prior to this review are accurate both the good and the bad comments. I paid $78 for a standard double bed. The bedding was wonderfully fluffy with just the right amount of back support. The decor was also nice for the price. The room was very large. Everything from the shampoo to the coffee was upscale. There is a Starbucks in the hotel plus several nice restaurants. If you can get a room facing the pond, then you will get a nice nightime view of the business parks in the area. This hotel looks like its website photos. My room was a very clean, but a bit ragged. The chair had tears, the lamp had large splattered stains, and the corner lap did not work. The bathroom was a plain bathroom. The beds were full size, not queen size so 2 people per bed would be a tight fit. This is what I wish I had known before I booked this hotel to improve my stay: First, the parking to this hotel is far from the entrance. Across a small street is garage parking. The cost is $10 flat fee for unlimited parking. Save all your tickets so that you can turn them in at the end of your stay. For a one night stay, it would have been better for me to park in the free parking lot on the side and back of the building and haul my luggage inside. The valets were young and enthusiastic. If I were less able or not been on a tight budget, I certainly would have used their help. Second, the room was rather worn, like at a much lower quality hotel. I would not have expected more.Third, I would have tried to negotiate a lower price from the hotel before booking it on line. They had lots of avalable space during my stay. The previous 3 nights I had stayed at the Fairfield in across the highway which to me had equally good beds, free breakfast, indoor pool, a workout room and nice staff. On this night the Fairfield Inn was charging $99 per night so I thought $78 at the Hilton has got to be better. It was not. I did not have a bad stay, but it was not all that I expected. Maybe staying on the higher floors (we were on the 6th floor) would have given us better quality and having a higher budget for tips would have given us better service. As someone passing through, I did not want to pay for Internet service, so I used my phone as a modem which was slow. There is a Business Center in the hotel but it was so far away, I was too tired to make the trip. Finally, I wish that I had known that this hotel is part of a complex of buildings that are linked together making this hotel a city all its own. The entrance is breathtaking. Travel in jeans and a t-shirt, I felt completely out of place-- until nighttime when I saw other people in jeans and regular shirts practicing their music in the lobby and kids playing in the outdoor pool. Many people wore business attire because they were coming and going from work whereas my work had ended. While I would definately stay in this hotel again only if I had a great rate. This hotel was like a taste of Texas for visitors to the state and I recommend it for visitors to the state, to Dallas, or for anyone wanting a good bed only if they get a great rate or they pay more for a better room and have a good budget. Trip Advisor customer reviews has been great in helping me pick good hotels for several years, and I hope this review helps others in their decision making process.

<Content>Great deal (for the price!) My husband and I needed a close-to-home quick get-away and this certainly fit the bill. I used Priceline-Name Your Own Price, so I wasn't trying to stay at this hotel specifically. Just put in 4 stars and the price I thought was far and pushed Enter. Was very surprised and happy with the hotel we got. The location was fantastic: close to great restaurants, movie theaters, shopping, etc. Overall, we had NO complaints. We knew about the parking issue going in ($10/day for parking garage) and just decided to let it go. The hotel is part of a three building business complex, and while there is public parking on the west side of the hotel, they will tell you NOT to park there because you may get towed. If it's a weekend, I wouldn't worry about it, but on Monday morning the parking lot was full by 9:00 a.m. The room was great: king bed, multiple down-fiber pillows plus a yard-long bolster. Nicely appointed with desk/chair/lamp, reading chair/floor lamp. Ironing board/iron came in handy. Coffee maker was a nice touch and housekeeping brought more cream in around five minutes afte requested. Mini-fridge was brought to our room b/c I called earlier and asked if the rooms came with them. They said, No, but would have one put in the room for us! Bathroom was fine, floor could have been mopped a little more thoroughly and the bathroom is always what gives away the age of the building, but all in all was fine. Family restaurants, Crockett's, was nice, but as usual, outrageously expensive. There are so many other places to eat in the area! Didn't really have ANY of the problems experienced by other reviewers. It was a quiet weekend without any noise or rudeness from anyone (other than the idiots who like to chain smoke around the pool). We would have enjoyed the pool more if it had been a more typical Dallas summer (water was a bit too cool for us... not for other's kids though!) oh, and turn off your air conditioner when you leave for a long time or you may come back to a meat locker!! Since this is typically a business hotel, great deals are to be had on the weekends and since it's right across the highway from the Galleria Shopping center, there is a free hotel shuttle to take you there. Great deal for the price we got on Priceline... would I stay there for the hotel's price? Probably not.

<Content>Nothing to write home about We've stayed in many Hiltons and this one is at the bottom of our list. The lobby is pretty nice, but the rooms and hallways are dated. The hallway to our room was dark and dingy, with stained carpeting. The furnishings in the room were fairly clean and in decent condition, although everything appeared to be in need of an overhaul, especially the bathroom. This property definitely did not meet the standards of the other four diamond Hiltons that we have stayed in (not really sure why it is a four diamond).

<Content>Top of the Range Hotel With two days left of a holiday to Dallas, we took a chance and used the net to find a special hotel experience. Looking at upmarket hotels in Dallas we were taken by the excellent rates offered for this hotel. Taking a chance we booked it, and were completely bowled over by the whole experience.The room was all you'd expect of a top class big city hotel. Excellent furnishings, whisper quiet air conditioning. Full facilities, including an excellent room service which we used extensively. I strongly recommend the 3 Chocolate Fudge Cake.The hotel has a very large lobby which is most impressive, and contains several bar/restaurants. We tried The Cricketers for a drink. Being English we could not resist a Cricket themed bar in of all places Dallas, and an enjoyable experience it turned out to be.Our room was on the 14th floor so we got a spectacular view of the city both during the day and at night when we had a spectacular thunder and lightning storm.A most enjoyable experience, at an incredible rate. Would gladly do again. On checkout we found a minor glitch with the bill, but this was quickly sorted out without any hassle.

<Content>Nice and convenient. Nice hotel, but a challenge to get too. As others have stated the rooms are a bit dark. If you stay on a weekend you can avoid paying 10 dollars to park and find free parking, just make sure you're not in a permit only area. This hotel was nice and definitely a business hotel (as others have stated).My only complaint was that the concierge lounge was closed on a Friday (which was the first Hilton I've ever experienced do that)

<Content>Nice surprise... I got a $90 rate at the Hilton and was first a little disappointed because I had read a negative review or two but fortunately, I soon found out that this is a very nice property, though a little hard to ge to. Updated rooms with GREAT linens and a large shower/tub combo. The only minor drawbacks besides the access were the $10 parking charge and $10 internet charge. And oh yeah, at least in my room, some kind of tapping noise in the HVAC system that I was aware of when I went to sleep, and again first-thing in the AM. Still, a very nice hotel with a good overall location near the Galleria, and at $90 - a real bargain. I'd be happy to return.

<Content>Disappointed with extra fees Overall the hotel was nice, however I was disappointed in the fees.The price for parking is $10 per day plus tax ,There is a $9.99 per day charge for an internet connection,they have no HBO ,Cinemax or orther premium channels in order to charge for in room movies.They left a bottle of water in the room available for $5.00 .The rooms were very nice,it is too bad this hotel believes that the room charge is not enough to cover their costs..Also be aware that there are hundreds of free parking spaces behind the hotel that you are never told about.I would elect to not stay here again when there are so many other choices in the area without the fees.

<Content>Excellent Hotel This is a lovely hotel with a lot of nice touches particularly if you stay on the executive levels.You get a complimentary continental breakfast which is very nice. In addition you have access to a free internet connected computer and printing meaning you don't have to pay for a business center. The rooms are nice, and the service is good.As in other hiltons, the bath shower isn't great but manageable.

<Content>One of the best Hilton Hotels This is really one of the best Hilton Hotels we have ever stayed at. We have been to this hotel twice now and on both occasions the service was exceptional and the food, excellent. The staff seem extremely well trained and are very knowledgeable and friendly.We are definitely looking for an excuse to visit Dallas again and pamper ourselves at the Hilton Dallas Lincoln Centre.

<Content>Ticks all the boxes Stayed at Hilton Lincoln Centre for one night - 17th July. Whilst on vacation, and this is clearly a business hotel, it is difficult to find any fault with this hotel.Check-in was efficient and friendly, the concierge was excellent, the executive lounge was fine, room and other facillities A1 - would have no problem staying here again.

<Content>Great place! Regularly stay at this hotel on business when visiting my customer. Always had a good stay here, its reasonable, and they are polite and friendly and always helpful. Its a good idea to join the HHonors programme if you stay at Hiltons regularly as you get free room upgrades if rooms are available. Lovely comfy rooms (hugh comfy botton with crisp cotton sheets), makes having to work all the better.

<Content>very nice hotel I don't understand all of the negative reviews. My husband and I had a wonderful stay here. Everyone treated us nice, from the check in desk to the shuttle bus driver. The wait staff at the sports bar were friendly and the food was good, especially the chocolate cake. We were on the executive level and the concierge lounge was open all weekend (previous reviews stated not open on weekends). We went to the Westin hotel (at the Galleria) and were glad we were not staying there, everyone seemed so uppity, including the older woman working at the gift shop, she couldn't even crack a smile or say hello. I wish we could have stayed longer, would definitely go back.

<Content>Stay at a Raddison.... I just got back from my trip to Dallas. This room cost my wife and I over $300. The hotel is nice, the staff is friendly. No real complaints, except for the price of the hotel. My wife and I had stayed at a Raddison in San Antonio last summer. It was wonderful. So we, decided to look for a Raddison for our second night stay. We found one prob 10-15 minutes away from the Hilton for less thatn half the price, and the hotel was just as nice, and had everything you need in a hotel stay, even helped me with my dinner reservation. Bottom line, save some money, stay at Raddison.

<Content>Not a 4 star for us We stayed at this hotel on New Years Eve. We did not know that this was the official Cotton Bowl Marching Band hotel until we were on their floor. Not fun. We were given a handicap accessible room which would have been fine if it had a closet seeing as it was NYE, we had a few parties to attend. We called downstairs and were told that no, they did not have a portable hanging rack, and that at 3:45pm the entire hotel was full so we could not be moved. Oh well, we hung our suit and gowns on the TV armoir. Other tidbits... The elevators are extremely slow. The hotel charges outrageous fees for internet access, both in the business center and in their rooms. We witnessed a few kids being arrested while enjoying a drink at the bar that evening. There is a charge for both valet and self-parking. The front desk was extremely rude at check out when there was a mistake on their part. We will very much avoid this hotel in the future... We have stayed at MUCH nicer 3 stars with better amenities.

<Content>Not My Cup Of Tea! I went to this hotel based on the reviews read. The hotel seemed like a nice hotel to go and visit just for an in-town getaway trip. Because it was close to the shopping malls and has undergone extensive renovations according to the reviews it seemed like a nice hotel. Well we arrived at the hotel and when pulling up to the entrance of the hotel where valet parking is located there were several people just hanging out in front of the hotel like it was a front porch or something. Everybody is looking at you, which made me pretty uneasy about checking in. I went around and parked by the Ballroom to go and check in to the hotel. Before I officially check-in to any hotel I like to view the room first to make sure it is of good quality. I was able to view the room the hotel has assigned to me and when asking for a nice view we received a parking lot view. What a nice view. I scoped the room and the property and it seems as though this was a nice property when first built, but it is a little old now, lights are dim and it makes the property look dingy. It also has that old smell to it, as though it has been around for awhile and that smell along with the cleaning smell is what you smell when you arrive. The rooms were average and clean and I feel like the cost could have been a little less than $100 bucks a night. However, the staff was very friendly and wanted to do whatever to make our stay a pleasant one. We ended up not staying at this property because it was not to our liking, but for a place to lay your head and leave it's ok.

<Content>I Was Expecting More I can't agree with the previous comment that the newly renovated Hilton is awesome. The lobby and meeting areas were nice, and the staff was professional. However, much of the renovation money was obviously spent on the common areas, not the room. The bed is new, as is the clock radio, and the room appears to have received a fresh coat of paint. But the furniture appears to be a hold-over and the bathroom fixtures are vintage 1980s. Self parking in the attached garage is $8 per day, but be prepared to walk a little (via an underground corridor). Given all of the discussion of the major renovations of this facility, maybe I was expecting too much, but the new-and-improved Hilton is nothing special. Worth a stay if you get a good rate, but don't seek it out.
