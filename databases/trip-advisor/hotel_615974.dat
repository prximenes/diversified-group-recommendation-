<Content>Great budget hotel!!! We stayed in this hotel with our two children as well as some friends who had children. Great location, very friendly helpful staff, and the room was more than we expected for the price. Rooms were clean, and the front desk was open 24 hours which was very nice. The hotel is on the end of a high end shopping street so it was a nice neighborhood, and very quiet. There was parking in front of the hotel, but we didn't use it because our navigation got us a bit lost! Our friends parked on the road though and their car was safe. The only minor complaint that I had was that in our room there was a gap under the door of about one inch that let a lot of noise in. Our friends did not have that problem in their room, though, so I don't know if there were other doors like ours.

<Content>Great location. We were initially in a triple room with a very tiny bathroom, but after complaining we were immediately moved to a much better room.They should really do something about the sheets, since they all have holes.But the location was great and the price so good that one could overlook these things.

<Content>very good service Very clean, nice hotel with an excellent staff. I lost my chain in our room but somebody from the staff found it and they shipped it for free; didn't even want to take the reward for the foundings. I would recommend this place to anybody while staying in Amsterdam. Btw. the hotel is actually very close to Van Gogh Museum and Rijksmuseum.

<Content>What Garden? The hotel is in a good location at the bottom end of the PC Hoofstraat , so just a 10 minute walk to the Leidseplein and is in a quiet location. The room was clean although very warm - I had to put on the air conditioning...also - and I know Amsterdam hotel rooms are famously diminutive - the room was miniscule. Ok it was a single, but if rabbit hutches do it for you then this is just the place. I could easliy touch both sides of the room with at the same time with my arms outstretched. The upstairs rooms may be better. Having said this, the breakfast was good value and the staff polite and the shower room worked well - although no plug for some reason.

<Content>A Mouse Lived in a Windmill.............. We wanted to stay in Amsterdam but away from the immediate hustle and bustle of the centre of the city, and in this respect the hotel did not disappoint. We were checked in promptly and politely and our room was adequately sized (there were four of us in a family room). Multi channel TV, clean bathroom, tea and coffee etc. but a bit short of hanging/drying space for what was a very wet weekend. Breakfast was a buffet-style with plenty to choose from and unusually was included in the price, which was a major deciding factor for us. Staff were friendly and spoke excellent English.We had a couple of problems. Firstly, the room safe had been left open by the previous occupant in the 'locked' position, so we couldn't use it. Reception said that they would sort it out when the next person with the master key came on duty. This turned out to be 11.00pm, when Reception kindly telephoned the room, duly waking us up and offering to fix the safe. Needless to say we declined, thinking they'd do it in the morning. They didn't and we heard nothing more about it and we did without it for our stay.On our last evening we were watching TV when a mouse appeared in the middle of the floor then quickly disappeared. We could not find where it went and reported it to Reception, who apologised and noted the fact but could do nothing about the mouse itself. To be fair, they offered to move us to another room, but with it being our last night we said we'd put up with it. We heard it in the small hours behind the dresser, but could do nothing about it and didn't see it again before check out. However, the attraction seemed to be the sugar sachets from the tea/coffee facilities which the rodent had clearly got wise to. Looking at some of the older reviews on this site, it seems that rodent infestation is not new at this hotel and clearly the professionals need to be brought in.I was also a bit surprised that the windows were single-glazed, which meant that even low-level noise from outside could be heard, especially at night, and also meant that heat was going straight from the radiators out of the window.I don't want the mouse incident to overshadow what I thought was a great little hotel, but I guess if it had happened on the first of our three nights then my view might have been different.

<Content>Nice location and good breakfast My husband and I recently stayed at the Hotel City Garden for 3 nights and had a wonderful experience. As many others have said, the rooms are small but everything else was great (you aren't there to be in your room anyway!). The accommodations were clean and had everything we needed. The breakfast was excellent and had a great selection. The location was perfect as it is on a quiet little street next to a very nice shopping district and near the tram stop. We walked everywhere rather than taking the tram and the hotel was located close enough to everything to do so. We highly recommend Hotel City Garden.

<Content>Great location Stayed at City Garden Hotel Amsterdam for 4 nights in April 08. Found it easy to get to via tram from railway station - not walking distance especially if you have luggage. Booked this hotel as wanted to be in a quieter area away from the red light district but close enough to walk/tram to all attractions. Hotel is in a quiet, upmarket part of the city close to a lovely park. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms are comfortable and clean but not huge. The buffet breakfast was excellent with lots of choice and as much as you want fresh food. The hotel is very close to all the museums and a nice walk or tram ride to the centre for all other attractions. Great peaceful base for exploring Amsterdam.

<Content>great wee hotel I have just come back from a 4 night stay at this hotel. I went along with my wife and my bother and his wife. The staff were great and we stayed in excellent rooms. The Hotel is away from the bizz but is near to Vlondell Park which was a lovely walk to the main areas.The shops around this hotel and are of top quality. All manner of top fashion labels. My sister who lives in Amsterdam picked this hotel so this gives you more corroboration of its appeal.The breakfast room is very busy and indeed when we were there it was full. If you wanted you couldd no doubt pay througth the nose and go up market. I paid 拢58.00 per person per night for bed and breakfast. I am booking this hotel next year. ps The weather was hot and sunny.

<Content>City Garden - most definately I stayed here with a fairly large group from work, for a weekend (2 nights) pre Christmas shopping etc. The trip was excellent and the hotel was very much part of that overall experience.Friendly staff at check-in and generally helpful at all times, excellent buffet breakfast. Free Internet point. Location was quiet, maybe a little bit out from Dam Square but easily accessible by tram and inexpensive.We found the people in Amsterdam to be very friendy and helpful from the tram drivers to shop owners and practically everyone we met. We were all amazed. It is a beaufiful city with canals, cyclists and beautiful buildings. On one day we visited the Cathedral, Van Gogh museum, Anne Frank museum, took a boat cruise and a visit to the Irish pub.We packed a lot into one day and still got to shop and visit the flower market the following morning before our flight back.Amsterdam has a more obvious and notorious tourist attraction but it has much, much more to offer the tourist. Very definately a city to return to in spring or early summer when it must surely be beautiful with all the tulips from Amsterdam in full bloom.

<Content>very good for the price My husband and I stayed here in sept 2007 for 3 nights. We booked last-minute via the internet. I think we paid around E100-110 euros per night which for amsterdam is really a good price from what I understand. We got a twin bed room which was very small, but very clean and suited us fine. I think you might be able to push the beds together if needed (I checked it out), but ultimately we didn't bother. The hotel's location is excellent, few minutes walk from the museums. Also the block of the street it is located on seemed to be relatively quiet. We don't smoke, and did not notice any cigarette smells at all. Room had a shower only, no bathtub. No problems with vermin, we even ate in the room couple of times, no problems. First night window was open and there was a little street noise, but we slept through it. After that it was very quiet. They had FREE wifi, a big plus for us, also if you don't have a laptop, they had one PC right off the reception lobby which guests can use for free. Many times when we walked in and out no one was using it.Another plus was the included free buffet breakfast, had hot scrambled eggs, cereal, yogurt, granola, deli meats, cheese, toast, juice, milk, teas. Very good and filling. Having stayed at multiple hotels and had mult breakfasts, this one was one of the better ones. Staff was very friendly and answered all questions. One day the bathroom was missing a floor mat, I think housekeeping forgot to give us one, and they took care of it. All in all, a very good deal and pleasant stay. I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again. Pros: very clean (we are picky, my husband inspects all the beds, linens, pillows, and sheets of every hotel he ever stays in)excellent location for museums, few minutes walknice and quiet blockfelt safe walking back to hotel around 9 or 10 oclock at night. I am a little 5ft woman and I walked back from the grocery store by myself. there is a grocery store few blocks from hotel. very good for snacks and water etc. We even bought fruit and sandwiches there for some meals. there is some kind of sandwich place down the street from the hotel (?on P.C. Hooftstraat?) which had very good sandwiches though it was very crowded at lunchtimeflat screen TV in roomfree wifi and free access to internet on one computer in lobby Cons: room is very small. I was expecting very tiny hotel rooms, so I wasn't disappointed. Also we brought only one carry-on size suitcase apiece so the luggage didn't take up a lot of space.

<Content>small but a wonderful hotel We stayed in this hotel as was our first time to Amsterdam, it is quite a distance from the Main train station but is easily accessible by the trams and buses.Upon arrival our check in was speedy and very friendly, the room that we were given was a bit small but very comfortable and clean, the same for the bathroom that was also very small and very clean.The staff could not of been more friendly, they helped us in everything including finding a very late night snack.So thank you very much to the staff and we would definately go back to this hotel

<Content>Great Hotel My Partner and I returned home from Amsterdam yesterday. We booked the Superior Double room from Feb 3rd to Feb 6th we had room 407. The bed was really really comfortable and we had clean towels everyday. The ensuite shower room was also very nice and the shower was excellent. We always had hot water. The only bad point if we wanted to be picky was the windows. They were old and let a bit of a breeze through them but it didn't make any difference to us as the heating was working and we also had a portable heater.We thought the hotel was excellant value for money. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was excellent. It is a buffet style with cereal, fruit, toast, rolls, croissaints, brioche, ham, cheese, boiled and scrambbled eggs and various condiments and drinks. The food is kept well stocked up and the restaurant was very clean. It was served from 7:30am til 10:30am.It is located right next to Vondel park and is in the museum district. It is not right bang in the centre but still very close to everything. We used the number 2 or 5 tram fron Van Baarlastraat stop which is a 3 minute walk. To get to the hotel from the airport take the train to Central Station, then get a tram from Central Station either number 2 or 5. Get off at Van Baarlastraat and it is a few minutes walk from there. It helps to have a strret map. Tickets for train can be bought at the airport and trams tickets can be bought at Central Station.Would definatley use this hotel again

<Content>nice hotel I stayed at the city garden hotel in november 2007 for 6nights with my boyfriend. we found the hotel very nice, our room was smalller than it looked but was just right for what we wanted. hotel staff are friendly and the 24 hour desk made it easy to be out enjoying the amsterdam nights. breakfast was basic but nice and hotel was clean overall, sheets and towels changed daily. would recommend hotel to anyone, definately worth it if you can get a cheap deal, bit overpriced otherwise.

<Content>Good Hotel I would not have gone had I read these reviews however we found quite the opposite. Our room was a triple and was large, as large as a travelinn and well equipped too with tea and coffee making facilities. Our friends had a double which was small but functional.The breakfast was good and the staff friendly and helpful.Only slight negative is one of our party was bitten badly and was told by the pharmacist it was bedbugs, could have been picked up at this hotel but nobody else was affected.We would go back.

<Content>Recommended by a fussy pair! My friend and I stayed in Room 273 and found it to be clean and comfortable. Sheets and towels changed daily, room was sufficient size with tea making facilities replenished each day, breakfast was simple but very edible and the staff, although we didn't require much, were helpful! Internet access available, storage for baggage, definately would stay here again and worth the money. Located on a quiet street beside Vondelpark, PC Hoovestraat, with great shopping and trams. All pictures as per website.

<Content>Small room, nice breakfast. I stayed at this hotel in May 2007 and found it to be average. On the plus side the free internet in the reception area was welcome, the breakfast was exstensive and tasty and the rooms had clearly been recently refurbished.On the minus side, the room was tiny, even though we were booked in a 'standard' room and not the 'small' room situated in the basement, I dread to think how small that one is! Also on the minus side, the hotel was still having renovations carried out (we were not told this when booking) and a workman started drilling at ten past eight one morning. The efficient reception staff were helpful with questions and there is a standard tourist information rack filled with details of things to do in Amsterdam. If you stay here it's possibly best to fork out a few extra euros and stay in one of the larger rooms.

<Content>We'd stay there again Pros: Excellent location, great breakfast (included), fairly clean, quiet, comfortable beds, nice towels and sheets, seems like it was recently remodeled. Staff spoke english very well, and were quite helpful. No A/C, but a fan in our room (I've never seen that in a European hotel, but was thrilled to not have to leave the window open in the late spring when it's so bright outside and my kids go to sleep early)Cons: A little pricey (but it is Amsterdam), and the cheap hotels website didn't quite book it right--maybe just go right to the hotel's website to make sure you get the fare right. We also had a mouse in our room (but hung up our food after the 1st night and only a few snacks were ruined). Not a big deal. We'd stay there again, since the price was average, the location excellent and the breakfast included.

<Content>A nice little hotel I was a bit worried about staying at this hotel after reading the reviews listed here. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised that most of them were not true. The room was clean and looked as if it had recently been renovated. The breakfast was quite varied and always had lots of food to fill you up in the morning. The bathroom looked newly renovated and was nice. The rooms included your own electronic safe. The location was a big plus, steps away from Vondelpark, Van Gough Museum, Rijksmuseum and the trams to Centrum. It is also located on a very posh shopping street featuring Hugo Boss, Gucci etc.The only downside was the room and bathroom were a little small, but that is to be expected in European hotels, but it was by no means a cupboard. I would consider staying there again if in Amsterdam in the future.

<Content>Affordable, comfortable, friendly. Cheers! I was a bit worried after booking this hotel to see the candid traveller photos. I am not bothered too much about the rooms, but I knew my friends would be.When we arrived at the hotel the reception staff were very friendly and remained so throughout our whole stay. We had a laugh with them when calling up taxi's etc.You can tell that the hotel has obviously just been renovated as the 2 rooms that we booked had all new carpets, bathroom, bed linen, TV etc.The bathrooms were tiny, I am not going to lie, but it was fine for me to have a shower in  brush my teeth in the morning.Our rooms weren't together, but I don't think we put this down as a request, so I can't really comment.The breakfast was your standard continental effort, but it was really nice and we were kept topped up!We were right beside the Vondelpark and only a short walk from one of the main musuems. Also the tram system was nearby and that can get you ANYWHERE and is very reliable.I never usually review, but I felt that this hotel got a bad reputation on here and after the staff being so nice to us and really enjoying our stay I had to put my word in ;)

<Content>Small Doubles are Cupboards To describe a 'small double' room as compact is an understatement. We arrived quite late in the evening it was -2 degrees outdoors. We were given a key for a room on the third floor. The room was so small that the two of us could not stand up at the same time. The bathroom although it looked clean smelled of drains. The double bed filled the whole area between the walls and was pushed up against a cold radiator and a metal framed window which ran ceiling to floor, the window was partially open and would not close properly. You could not walk around the bed, and the person at the right hand side had to endure the cold from the window. At 2.00am after hours of trying to get the radiator to work, frostbite set in an we had to contact reception with a view to either getting the radiator to work and the window to shut, or change rooms. The staff were very helpful and having given up on the radiator moved us to a room in the basement. This room was marginally bigger, though the bed was in exactly the same place pushed against old badly fitting windows, the bathroom did not smell quite so bad, and the heating worked with a choice of red hot or cold. This room was located right underneath the 24 hours reception and bar which resulted in it being quite noisy and a lot of furniture moving went on around 3.30 - 4.00am every morning.The buffet breakfast was adequate, the problem was that the three ladies responsible for topping things up etc were reluctant to clear away the tables, thus on busy mornings it was difficult to find a clean one, we had to clear and clean our own.The hotel is situated in an ideal location for walking into the city centre, the staff on the whole were welcoming and friendly, the problem is the building which is need of a complete makeover.I do not recommend.

<Content>Nice, friendly, affordable hotel We stayed here a couple nights at the start of our trip. The staff was very friendly, and the accomodations were quite good for the low price, and the location is good. One small warning is that there are no safes in your room, and the safe at the front desk seemed to only be big enough for passports and cash.

<Content>Hotel City Garden I stayed at the City Garden for five nights and, having booked over the web, got a good deal, saving about 鈧?0 a night on their walk-in prices. The Hotel is under new management from June 2005 and planning a re-vamp in October 2006. So they say. The trouble is the management rents the building from a landlord, so the fabric and other problems are out of their hands to a degree. The current managers say it hadn't had a penny spent on it by the previous owners.It shows in places... the lift was tempermental but that was more of a joke to me than a problem. Other guests had booking problems ... an unmade room at midnight was compensated for one couple by a cash discount if they made their own bed on arrival!An American checked in at midnight one evening to find he had lost his wallet...probably in the taxi. The receptionist phoned the taxi-controller and within half an hour his wallet was returned, intact, to the hotel foyer.My room was clean, enjoyed a traffic-free, silent, tree-lined view over the Vondel Park (rare in any city) with a huge window which I could sleep by and the double bed I had to myself was very comfortable. Dutch hotels often have compact rooms (it's the style) and the art deco bar may look worn, but is in keeping with traditional Dutch values.The breakfast was a good morning buffet. I know Dutch hotels and the City Garden is typical of many - in need of investment; compact rooms and showers, creaking floorboards, thin walls and steep stairs (56 when the lift wasn't working). But it is also big on being friendly and helpful. I had a beer at the bar with the night-staff most evenings and was treated like a friend. If I'd wanted a large room, luxury surroundings and subservient uniformed staff I could have stayed at an international, but I like to get to know the people who live and work there. Perhaps that's why I understood their problems and was treated so well. This is a genuine review (my first ever) and I felt I had to bring these reviews up to date. After all, I spent five nights, with breakfast included in Amsterdam, for less than 鈧?00 during the summer season. Try to remember also, that Amsterdam has not got enough hotel rooms for its popularity - so the more pricey hotels can get away with a lot. Accept you have a cheap place to sleep and have a good breakfast - and treat the staff well and you'll be well rewarded. Even if it is with a free beer because the cleaner (or the computer) has disabled your bedroom key-card (twice!) and the lift is playing up again at 1 in the morning. (56 stairs up; 56 down; have a laugh and a beer; 56 stairs up...) Sleep like a log.

<Content>Something out of a horror movie We arrived at this establishment early evening after a 12 hour flight from Hong Kong- our travel agent had booked it and we had prepaid NZ$680.00 for a two night stay. The receptionist informed us, on arrival, that our room was on the third floor and the lift was broken - unfortunately no porter either!! This would have meant carrying our substantial baggage up 3 flights of stairs - not really an option - so we asked if they had anything on the ground floor - just one room she said. Once we were inside with our baggage there was actually no room to move, two single beds, a very small bathroom. After a series of negatives, lack of phone or any communication we started to feel decidedly uncomfortable so asked for a taxi to another hotel. All in all a dreadful experience and would not wish anyone to have the same.

<Content>horrible experience The address was on one of the most chic in Amsterdam, and the description published by the hotel boasted of many amenities. However, when my taxi arrived in the late evening, I realized immediately that I was going to be extremely disappointed. The carpet was frayed, the door sqeaked, and the receptionist was rude and untidy. If it was not for the time of evening, I would have left immediately. However, I did check in to a very small room with two uncomfortable beds. The bedspread had several cigarette burns, the towels were paper thin and the bed was lumpy. My goal was to endure the night and get out the first thing in the morning. I discovered that AMS had another hotel about four blocks down toward the Concertgebouw. I inspected a room there and was pleased. It was twenty euros more but certainly worth it.I would not recommend anyone staying in the AMS Holland as it is a dismal place to spend sixty nine euros. I felt dirty staying there even if it is just down the street from some of the most refined shops in the city.

<Content>Wish I'd checked TripAdvisor first... I wish I'd checked here first before allowing a travel agent to book me into this dive. The location may be good, but the only good thing about the hotel itself is the door out of it.Our room was downstairs at basement level, and was dark, dingy and dirty. This is without contest the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. We did not feel safe here, and would not recommend anyone to stay here.

<Content>Better choose another hotel. If you can choose another, do not go to this hotel. The only advantage is it's location. It's amazing to fing a good critic about this hotel (I suspect written for sure from someone from the Hotel STAFF who doesn't want to loose clients). The best way to keep clients is to treat them well and to probide what you are paying for. We were disgusted with the rooms which had holes in the coutains, torn sheets, rust around the sink, weird smells and something green growing on the ceiling of the bathroom, mouse traps and lots of dirt. We stood there four nights. The only thing they do every morning is to change your towells. (No cleaning, no tiding... Nothing). The breakfast it's quite short but it's enough. It's one of the worses hotels I've ever visited.

<Content>clean and well located My family found this hotel to be perfect for our needs; certainly the decor is outdated and the carpets worn, but the room was clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, particularly at the lobby bar and the location (within walking distance of Vondelpark, Museumplein and Leidseplein) was ideal. The negative reviews this hotel has received suggest people who spend a lot more time in their hotel rooms when they travel than we do. We'll stay there again.

<Content>1 star is even a bit generous This hotel needs some major remodeling. Giving it 3 stars is way too much. 1 star is pushing it. The location is good and the staff are very friendly, however the rooms need some serious remodeling...

<Content>AMS Holland Hotel, in a word "DISCUSTING"! As many of the other guests I talked to when I was there, we were discusted with the rooms. Our room had torn sheets, holes in the walls,rust around the sink and shower plugs, fur growing on the ceiling of the bathroom, filthy carpets and Rentokill mouse traps around the skirting boards. One couple we talked to had been bitten all night and couldn't sleep. We were very dissapointed and even rang our travel agent and tried to changed hotel but everything was fully booked, It was a Valentines holiday I booked and we had seperate beds, when I asked at reception if they would swap our rooms for a double they wasn't interested. I am going to complain in writing to my Travel Agent and accompany this with Photographs.

<Content>Will visit again For the price it charges the AMS Holland is definitely worth visiting again.It is clean and has good room service/tidying every morning.Breakfast is superb.Only drawback is the TV set is too low and pose a danger to those who are tall-room 158.Cheerio.
