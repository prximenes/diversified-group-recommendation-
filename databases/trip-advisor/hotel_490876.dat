<Content>Great Hotel close to the necessities We stayed at Goethe87 for 3 nights in October and had a wonderful stay. I booked because of the reviews on Trip Advisor (which by the way were accurate for every place we stayed throughout Europe). Because it has a kitchenette we were able to save money by cooking our own breakfasts and dinners and there is a supermarket two blocks away opposite Zoologischer Garten station, which is about a 5-7 minute brisk walk from the hotel. Check-in was a breeze and our room was clean and modern. The only negative was the light from the street coming through under the blinds of the window but we just put a towel under it and it was fine. The bathroom and shower were excellent but we couldn't get the safe in the room to work but that didn't really bother us. Because it is close to the train station, it is easy to get around and we all bought 3-day passes for all the public transport which worked out well. For the price that we paid for the room (99 euros) this was an absolute bargain compared to other places we stayed in Europe and you get a lot for your money. Overall an excellent stay and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Goethe 87 Bliss My partner and I stayed 3 nights and they were all WONDERFUL. We both travel a lot and stay in lots of apartments and hotels and this was by far the best in any country I've been in lately. The rooms are beautiful, the service is friendly and the location is really convenient for sight seeing and dining out.

<Content>Excellent hotel This hotel is less than 10 minutes walk to Zoologicagarten station and was a very pleasant surprise. We were upgraded to a large 1 bedroom suite, quiet ,modern and all the facilities of a top hotel. The shower had 6 outlets, nice sized kitchen and the walk-in robe was as large as many hotel rooms. All of this for less than 100 eoros!

<Content>Great Goethe87 This hotel is perfect! My wife and I have stayed in many hotels, but Goethe87 certainly has captured our attention as being amongst the top. Goethe87 was fantastic from the moment we arrived at 9 AM after a long overnight flight and they let us check in right away. .This hotel is certainly beyond the WOW factor..Location-The location is fabulous. Gives you the atmosphere of being in a boutique hotel. It is a classy hotel on a quiet street with near transportation and wonderful restaurants, and gives you the atmosphere of being in a boutique hotel.Amenities: Amenities is perfect and modern, and bathroom is very special.Staff-The best words of appreciation should go to Goethe87鈥檚 manager Robert Novacic who brought the personal touch to our wonderful stay. He was very responsive and tried his best to make our trip to Berlin very memorable. Mr. Novacic, who was fluent in English, helped us with all directions and advised us on attractions, restaurants, food and customs. We were very grateful for his care and service. They were above and beyond on our imagination. The ownership of this hotel can be proud of such a manager. Robert makes this place very execptional. The bottom line: if we are lucky enough to pass through Berlin again we know where we will want to stay 鈥?at Goethe87Robert

<Content>i could live at the Goethe87 The Goethe87 Hotel in Berlin was well-reviewed on Tripadvisor, and my wife and i decided to give it a go for the one night we were in the city. We just wish that we could have stayed longer.The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from Zoo station in the beautiful area of Charlottenburg, or 10 minutes from the Savignyplatz S-bahn station. The entrance is on the 1st (or, for you Americans, 2nd) floor.It is not a full-service hotel (no minibar, whoopee) but is more an apartment hotel. From the friendly check-in to the beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean apartment with its tea and coffee-making facilities to the plethora of nearby restaurants, we enjoyed the whole experience. No, breakfast was not included, but a coffee and pastry at a nearby cafe compensated for that. Certainly, we were upgraded, but the ultramodern and stylish fittings would have been the same throughout the hotel, of course. Really, apart from the lack of breakfast (which we knew about) we could not find fault with the place.

<Content>Great neighborhood, fantastic hotel After reading the rave reviews, we selected this hotel for our four night stay in Berlin. Our room was immaculate and the wellness shower was a special treat after walking all around Berlin. We did not have breakfast in the hotel, however, there were several wonderful cafes nearby, as well as some bakeries. The staff was extremely accommodating with information. The hotel in located in Charlottenburg, a great area for shopping, don't miss the KaDeWe department store's gourmet food on the top floor. Out of this world!This hotel was very reasonably priced and was a lot larger than you would get in NYC for twice the price.

<Content>Excellent Goethe87 Hotel I have just returned from three nights at this excellent hotel. It is well situated in a pleasant and relatively quiet part of the city but with many nice restaurants and shops nearby. There are also S and U bahn stations only a short walk away. The room we had was large, light, airy, spotlessly clean, well appointed and attractively decorated. The showers, as many other reviewers have already stated, are out of this world, being by far the best I have ever had the pleasure of using. The staff were all friendly and helpful and spoke good English. The breakfast we had in a modern and very pleasantly decorated room on the ground floor was also of a high standard with a wide choice of good quality food and efficient service. I look forward to returning to this hotel at the earliest opportunity and would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone else looking for a very good quality hotel in the charming and fascinating city of Berlin.

<Content>Perfect - so central and clean I am just back from spending five wonderful nights at this great hotel. I read the reviews of the hotel on Tripadvisor - and they were spot on. From the moment we checked in (and got a free upgrade) we knew we'd struck gold. The rooms are huge, light and airy. They were always spotless and are equipped with everything you could need - kitchenette, fridge, air con, dvd player, radio and different types of pillow. The showers are out of this world, they blast you from all directions. It is obviously well insulated as we never heard any noise at night. The location is superb too - minutes from main shops and five mins to U and S Bahn which takes you to all the sights.There is a GREAT Spanish place five mins walk away called Mar Y Sol. I would find it hard to believe anyone could be disappointed with this excellent, and for the centre of Berlin failry cheap, hotel. We WILL return!

<Content>Spectacular! An extremely nice place to stay in west Berlin. The rooms are very large, extremely clean, nicely decorated. The hotel is located at about 5 minutes walk from the Zoologischer Garten train station, one of the main in Berlin. Therefore access by s-bahn or subway is very convenient. The hotel staff was very helpful. Overall I had an extremely pleasant stay!

<Content>Great Find in Berlin I booked Goethe 87 based on the great reviews I saw here on Trip Advisor, and was not disappointed! Had a great 3-night getaway with my husband in the mid-sized suite. We found the location convenient and quiet, the hotel itself clean and tastefully decorated, and the suite very comfortable. We were able to cook in the kitchenette and there was English-language news. We liked the neighborhood, cute shops, cafes, and a small organic grocery nearby, and were able to walk (about 5-10 mins.) to public transport. The well being shower was incredible and relaxing as others have mentioned. I highly recommend a stay here!

<Content>Top Notch for Studio Hotel This studio hotel, with efficient kitchen and super modern amenities gets the highest ranking I could give an establishment. The service, albeit not a full-service hotel, was by far the most efficient and pleasant I have experienced. In a quiet, beautiful part of Berlin, it is an easy walk to the U and S Bahn. The shower is fantastic; the bed is very comfortable; the rooms are modern, crisp and clean; and our continental breakfast through room service was impeccable.

<Content>Loved this Hotel! We visited Berlin with a German friend and she chose this hotel for us. We could not have been happier. The hotel is clean, comfortable and modern. You are greeted with two green apples on your pillows and a free large bottle of water. Our room had a lovely little alcove with a desk overlooking the street. Perfect for writing postcards. And the shower! So many different shower heads shooting water from different directions. After a wonderfully long day of sightseeing, it was a great way to relax. We also had a small kitchen with a refrigerator and microwave. We took advantage of this by visiting a nearby market and stocking up on breakfast items, snacks and drinks. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. And the neighborhood is beautiful. Just steps away from the Zoo Station and the famous Kurfurstendam Shopping Street. Don't miss the KaDeWe Department Store. The largest on the continent. There are plenty of cafes nearby. Also, a few blocks down on the same street as the hotel is a wonderful little bookstore run by a Bostonian. It sells English language books for those of you who find you have run out of something to read during your stay. We enjoyed our stay so much that after four nights we hated to leave.

<Content>A little gem One of the nicest hotels I have stayed in! We were upgraged to one of the larger rooms as the hotel was quiet. The room was very modern, spacious and immaculately clean. I loved it! The staff were very helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations. I loved the area of Charlottenburg and was so glad I decided on this as a location. Everything was nearby. Much better than staying in the larger areas where everything was more spread out. Despite horrible weather- rain and snow, it was lovely to come back to our hotel room every night,. Shower was amazing and the floor does not get wet if you do not open it immediately after showering as there is still water running off it. Much nicer than staying in a big impersonal chain.

<Author>Keen_Traveller_NI
<Content>Fantastic Booked this hotel/apartment to fit into a much needed relaxing break with my husband.The apartments are advertised as luxuary apartments and we were not disappointed. We booked a studio apartment and was pleasantly surprised at the size of the apartment - we did worry that it was just going to be a box, like most European accomodation but we did not feel at any point we needed extra space- we were there for 5 nights. The apartment had a walk-in wardrobe big enough to be a bedroom!The apartment itself was wonderful - well decorated(contempory-chic), had all the mod-cons i.e. LCD tv, dvd player, hob, microwave oven, coffee filter machine, safe, etc..... It was cleaned daily and as mentioned in other reviews, the shower/bathroom was absolutely fantastic!Location - The apartments are located within 10mins walk to the S-Bann ('Zoo' stop) and 5mins walk to one of the major shopping streets. It is surrounded by numorous eateries-greek, italian, chinese, vietnamese, thai,etc....not to mention bakeries, delicatessens supplying fresh breads/desserts/cakes/cheeses/hams etc... With the S-Bann being so close, it was relatively easy to get to once getting off the plane - there is a S-Bann station from the airport straight to the stop 'Zoo'.Value for money - Cost of apartment is not for the budget traveller but it is affordable - approx 拢80 per night. When compared to other hotel deals and consider what you are getting for your money, it is actually quite a good deal. Entertainment - Due to the time of year and the type of trip we wanted, we didn't really go partying in the evenings, but was quite happy spending our evenings in nearby restaurants enjoying a lovely meal. With its nearby public transport links, we were able to do all the sightseeing we wanted and was not left thinking we had missed anything.Would we recommend staying? Definitely yes!

<Content>The Best of Berlin I selfishly hesitated to write this review as I鈥檓 afraid the next time I go to Berlin, Goethe 87 will be sold out! My husband, my mother, her friend and I all stayed for a week at Goethe 87. It stands tall as the best deal we encountered in Europe, we all loved it. These hotel rooms are like small apartments and include their own doorbell, kitchenettes, and balconies. They are tasteful, sleek and appointed with the best features, such as Gaggenau stoves and refrigerators, gorgeous French doors that swing open or hinge at the bottom for a breeze, push-button shade closures and high-end fixtures throughout. Our room had a lovely view and was very quiet. The bathroom shower is a dream, equipped with a Grohe wellness apparatus that shoots water at you from various heights, culminating in a large rainshower head and a hand-held sprayer. The entire impression is Euro-style and upscale.There is daily cleaning service, despite the apartment schematic. There is free onsite laundry service and wireless internet, unheard of at their rate. The reception and Bistro staff were utterly professional and always helpful. They lent us an English book on what to do in Berlin, and when we couldn鈥檛 figure out the shower workings, someone came right to our room and demonstrated for us. They lent us an umbrella when it rained and even faxed for us. If we called for something, it was immediately addressed. We were very impressed. We did have a concern with the cleaning staff, but that was quickly rectified and apologized for.Goethe 87 is in what was once one of the most fashionable parts of town, Charlottenburg. The trend factor loss to the east is our gain in the west, as staying in Charlottenburg is now less expensive than say Berlin Mitte or nearer to the gate. Bearing in mind that Berlin had the best transportation system we encountered, anywhere you stay is accessible to the city centers, and Goethe 87 is surrounded by excellent shopping and varied restaurant choices. When you stay at Goethe 87 you feel you are absorbed into the lifestyle of Berlin. The post office is across the street, the apothecary is around the corner, the grocer is down the street and the Kurfurstendam is a few blocks away鈥攍ife goes on around you as it would for a local; the environment is authentic Berlin. Berlin is a lush, fascinating, historic and vibrant city with an international flair, don鈥檛 bypass it, and get out to museum island! Surrounding the city are a multitude of relaxing parks, quaint lakeside towns (Tegel-am-see), and castle areas (don鈥檛 miss the Potsdam Palaces). There is an active art scene. I loved Berlin and Goethe 87 made it truly comfortable and memorable for our entire group. A++!

<Content>Awesome stay The hotel is situated in a quiet area of Berlin, Charlottenburg. It's on walking distance (10mins) of the Zoo Station and the Kurfurstendamm.The rooms are big. We booked a 35 square meter Studio Ballade for 98 euros per night. The studio's interior is very modern and looks brandnew. On first entrance, the hotel staff has left a nice green apple on top of your pillow. Other cool features: nice big windows that can be opened; an LCD tv; a nice kitchenette incl. micro wave and complete set of glasses, plates, etc.But the hottest of all features is the generous bathroom with wellness shower! God, we loved taking (long!) showers in this hotel. In fact it's a shower with 4 massaging water sources (whats that called in English? Shower heads?).Staff is very friendly and helpful too.
