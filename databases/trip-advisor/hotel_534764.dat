<Content>A few mionr issues, but overall pleasant stay. I stayed at the hotel 6 nights and 5 days.Positives: Close to the beach, less than one minute walk. Very close to the main avenue with restaurants and shops. Helpful staff. They have a room in the lobby with about 3 computers with free internet service; most of the time there is a computer available. Sound proof elevators. I stayed on the 12th floor, with a city mountain view, one large king size bed. The room was clean, the bed comfortable. Good size balcony. Negatives:No Continental breakfast. They have a restaurant in the lobby. The issues is that the food is way overpriced. The breakfast meal I think was around $15 for all you can eat buffet. The restaurant of course was mostly empty, given the numerous other restaurants and fast food joints in close proximity with much more reasonable prices. The doors to all rooms, at least on the 12th floor slam when they close. Also the hotel I noticed had sort of connection to Korean Airlines, they would have multiple parties of people staying together. This was an issue for a few night as they had a large party staying in a few rooms next to mine, and when they would enter and leave the rooms the doors would slam very loud. Also there was no workout room. The TV service was terrible. Although I had a flat screen TV, the service was poor quality. There was no movie service available. The local TV programs with Waikiki activities etc. did not work. But this was a minor issue as most people don't go to Waikiki to watch TV. Conclusion: Overall good hotel, the higher the floor you stay on the better it gets. A few issues no continental breakfast, no workout room, weak TV service, and load closing doors.

<Content>Good location For a short stay this is an above average choice for the price range. Morning staff is very friendly. The section of Waikiki beach a block away is great for little kids. It's nice to see the beach and aqua blue water from the partial beach view units, but try to get as high up as possible; these units face Koa Ave which is used by the tour buses, trolleys, delivery trucks and garbage trucks to sit and idle until they are off to the next destination. We were on the 8th floor and it's not high enough to escape the sounds of Manhattan.

<Content>Was decent for the price This hotel was priced accordingly. My husband and I went there for our honeymoon for the first 3 nights before flying to Maui. There is so much to do there that we hardly paid attention to the room we were in. We wanted cheap pricing so we expected the room to be accordingly so no big complaints here. Room was fairly clean and we got upgraded to a junior suite because of our honeymoon.

<Content>perfect for the family My family of 4 as well as my father n law stayed at this hotel. Before i left on my trip i read the reviews about the hotel and not all were good. Well the people who left the bad reviews must be used to staying at the ritz carlton. This hotel was fantastic especially for my 2 boys. We had a deluxe ocean view studio. It had a kitchenette, nothing big but had the necessitys like a micro,fridge and even dishes. The room was able to connect to my father n laws room whos room was a bit smaller than ours but was just fine for him since he was alone. The view from the balcony was great the beach was literally right there. The beach was only 1 block away and hawaii blocks are small. ABC stores on every corner which made it great to pick up snacks on the way back from the beach. Pacific Beach hotel was across the street, That is where most of the touring companys pick up so that was very convenient for us. Overall the hotel stay was great and if you are traveling with kids and are on a budget this is the place to stay without having to worry about a run down hotel. There was flat screen tvs in our rooms as well. Ask for a corner room facing the beach or else you might get stuck in the middle and have to stare into the hotel across the street. Great hotel will definetly stay there again!!! We didnt even have to rent a car we were in the middle of everything!!!

<Content>Horrible Hotel The lighting in the room was Very Poor. The bathtub was half the normal size. There was no coffee pot, too much street noise, a dog barked ALL night, the garbage trucks woke us up at 5:00am every morning, the doors slammed upon closing, the pillows were too thin and felt like jello, the blankets were thin, the beds were not Queen size as advertised. People were smoking in their rooms, but we were in a non-smoking area. The bathtub backed up, the refrigerator was worthless. I felt like bugs were biting me all night when I slept and when we arrived home all of us had bites all over our bodies. We observed the laundry area when leaving and returning from the parking garage and NEVER saw the blankets, covers and bed protector being washed. The front desk did not tell us the parking policy $18 dollars a day; we had to force the information out of the desk clerk. The parking meter kept taking our validated parking slip. The neighbors children kept slamming the doors and running through the halls yelling and screaming; we had to call security. The older man that stayed in the same room came back at 1:00 am and began yelling at the occupants through the door. We will NEVER stay at the Waikiki Resort Hotel again.

<Content>good location.. that's about it.. My husband and I booked a mini economy room at this hotel, and it was unbelievably small. I'm from NYC, so I'm used to small hotel rooms, but it was not only extremely small, but it was very very outdated and rundown. We considered switching hotels until we talked to the front desk and we were told that we could upgrade our room to a larger ocean view room for an additional $30 a day. Since we already got a good deal through expedia, we decided to take the upgrade. The larger room was much better, since the beautiful ocean view makes anything better. However, it was still very rundown and in great need of remodeling. The walls and furniture have smudges on them, the wall paper is peeling, the showers are tiny and old, there's no room service or concierge, the beds are old and uncomfortable, and everything looks like it hasn't been updated since the early 90's. All this said, however, it has a very convenient location, right by Waikiki beach, it's in a safe neighborhood, they have their own parking lot, their free shampoos and soaps smell nice, and if you're in to Korean food, they have a great Korean restaurant in the hotel that serves good Korean food for all three meals a day. Also, it is affiliated with Korean Airlines in some way, so if you have Korean Airlines mileage, you may get a discount, and it's very Korean friendly, with the Korean speaking workers and the Korean restaurant. I probably wouldn't stay here again for vacation purposes, but if you want a good deal for a very average room at a hotel by the ocean, and you don't care about any luxury amenities, it's fine.

<Content>Great Experience......... We just returned from a 10 day stay that was a combination of a business and pleasure trip. This hotel hit a home run in both ways. They were undergoing a renovation to correct past shortcomings and to get more up to date, but there was very little inconvenience other than one of the 3 elevators being worked on while we were there. One renovatation was the addition of a nice large flat screen TV on the wall that added lots of room to the average size rooms. We got an oceanview room that had a partial view of the ocean and the surfers on the beach. It was great to go out on the lanaii to have a morning cup of coffee and to watch the city wake up to another day in Paradise. cities are by their nature busy, but Honolulu is probably the most laid back city I've ever been in, so the crowded Waikiki area isn't as bad as you would think.What made the hotel one of the best I've stayed in was the staff. They were smiling, friendly, and genuinely wanted to be of service and to please. We noticed the heavy Korean influence in the hotel and found out it was Korean owned and had just hired an California based management company. The large numbers of Koreans and the presence of a Korean Airlines office made for a nice experience in a hotel that was full of guests. The staff was so service oriented and anticipated our needs that we almost forgot we were in a nearly full hotel instead of being the only guests in the hotel. We especially liked the 2 restaurants, one an upscale Korean/Asian one and the other a Hawaiian/American style one. the food was top notch and the service was sparkling.The half block distance to the beach and closeness to the middle of Waikiki's shopping and night life make this an excellent choice in a headquarters for a visit to Oahu. All the tour busses stop there and they have an underground parking floor in the basement with an elevator that goes straight up to your room. Also, good deals can be had on rental cars and my advice is to take your GPS system with you or rent one. They are great and take a lot of stress out of driving in an unknown area with long and hard to pronounce names!The Waikiki Resort Hotel made us very happy on our trip and I highly recommend it to others who want a good value hotel near the beach.Tha Laird

<Content>Great place to stay! Just returned from Waikiki and would definately recommend this hotel. Our room hadn't been renovated yet, but it was still clean and comfortable - we had a deluxe suite, which came with queen bed, double pullout and mini kitchen (sink, microwave and fridge), which fit our family (myself, husband and 11 and 13 year old girls) just fine. Staff were friendly and accommodating and you can't beat the location for the price - a 30 second walk to the beach, close to everything!We lucked out and were given an ocean view room, which really set the tone for our stay - would highly recommend that the ocean view is worth a few extra dollars! Was great to drink morning coffee on the lanai and watch the surfers! The pool was also nice and never too busy.

<Content>Just fine for us. Great stay. This hotel is great for the price. I was pleasantly surprised after reading some of the other reviews on this site. We booked a package deal with flight through a tour provider, so I don鈥檛 know what the rates were. I鈥檓 guessing they were about $100 a night for 6 nights in mid-February. We were primarily there for the Police concerts (which ROCKED btw) so the hotel didn鈥檛 concern us much. It鈥檚 not like we were on our honeymoon, and we don鈥檛 typically stay at plush places anyway. As long as the hotel is safe, clean and quiet, we are OK. The Waikiki Resort Hotel was all three. Prior to arriving, I鈥檇 emailed the hotel鈥檚 customer service department and asked for a room away from the elevator because I ALWAYS end up near the elevator. When we got there, the room they initially assigned to us was on the 9th floor directly across from the elevator. As soon as we got in the room, I called the front desk and explained my earlier request. They moved us to another room right away. They even let me look at it first (with a security guard). In fact, Adam at the front desk was very helpful. We took the second room on the 18th floor. It was Penthouse E. But before you get excited, the penthouse is the same as other rooms. Nothing different. We had two full beds and a fridge. The room was clean, as was the whole hotel. The AC hadn鈥檛 been turned on and was locked, so I called Adam again. He said he鈥檇 send a maintenance man ASAP. When the maintenance man didn鈥檛 arrive after about 25 minutes, I called Adam again and he apologized profusely and the maintenance man was at our door in 5 minutes. Later in our stay, the AC got locked again in the on position (a little too cold) and we called again. A maintenance man was there right away to adjust it. This time, my husband watched how he unlocked the thermostat in case we needed to do it again. The view from the room was the neighborhood and hills behind the hotel. Since we didn鈥檛 spend a lot of time in the room that was fine. At night, the view was very cool. The lights from the houses on the hills curved and reminded us of lava flowing down the hills. Very cool.Speed of the elevators is fine.The shower IS tiny. I had to figure out a way to shave my legs w/o getting water on the floor. My husband is very tall and the showerhead height was OK for him. But if you are a heavy person, the shower stall will definitely be too small for you. We left our maid $2 each day and our request for more towels on the first day was filled and we never had to ask again. We didn鈥檛 request clean sheets every day (in fact we told the maid to leave them). We don鈥檛 change the sheets every day at home, why would I waste laundry water somewhere else? We got lotion, shampoo and soap. The vent in the toilet/shower stall area was filthy inside, but since you don鈥檛 spend a lot of time in there, who cares?The good: Price, cleanliness and quiet. This is a small hotel compared to most in Waikiki or Honolulu. It鈥檚 really not a RESORT, though that鈥檚 in the title. And I was fine with that. Several friends stayed at the Hawaiian Hilton Village (HHV). Wow. That鈥檚 a HUGE resort. It kept going and going. Everything was SOOOOO expensive (food, drinks) and it was very, very, very busy. There was always a long line to check in. The HHV has a lot of bars, restaurants and shops, but it was too bustling for my taste. We were OK with the laid back atmosphere at Waikiki Resort Hotel (WRH)Location: less than a block to the beach in front, less than a block to the bus stops on the street behind the hotel. A McDonald鈥檚 and Burger King w/in a minute鈥檚 walk and Starbucks and Subway w/in a 4 minute walk. There are three ABC stores w/in a 2 minute walk, two in front of the hotel and one behind. The beach is a 60 second walk. It鈥檚 pretty busy in that area, but walk a few minutes toward Diamond Head and the park and the beach is less packed. Ritzy shopping is just a few blocks away as are the zoo and aquarium.My husband rented a longboard and the bell hop stored it for $5 a day, which was very convenient. The local surfers were helpful to him too, which he鈥檇 heard is not always the case. But surfing was fine.Refrigerator 鈥?buy beer and water at ABC, save $$$$$.The staff was pleasant/helpful each time we spoke with them. Ask for the bus map.The bad: The business center didn鈥檛 have a printer so I couldn鈥檛 print our boarding passes to fly home. That seems stupid. The hotel should get a printer and charge people 5 cents for a sheet of paper if they are worried about waste. The business center was $7/hr. I heard (but did not confirm) that the HHV was $7.50 for 15 minutes!Shower size 鈥?already discussedPool 鈥?it was nothing to write home about. Very sparse area. If you want a fabulous poolside experience, you need to go to someplace like the HHV (though HHV is very strict about what can go in the pool 鈥?no beach balls, no kid floaties, etc.)The room doors were heavy and noisy. Even if you tried to shut them quietly, they banged. This was the only noise we heard from our neighbors except when they talked in the hall. We could not hear them in the next room.Notes: The city bus to the Pearl Harbor/Arizona memorial took an hour to get there and 80 minutes to get back. Cheap and easy, but if you don鈥檛 have the time to spare, take a shuttle (not a cab!) The bus was very easy to use but we did find that there were fewer routes on the weekends and evenings so we had to take cabs a few times to get to places on time.Do not try to walk to the Diamond Head visitor鈥檚 center. It鈥檚 too far combined with the hike to the top (which is totally worth it). Take the bus there.We found a great hole in the wall for breakfast. Leave the hotel and go to the street behind it where the bus stops are. Turn left at the ABC store on the corner. Walk straight until you see a tiny little park (like a triangle) with a statue of a woman and a goose (?) in the middle. There is a restaurant called Hula Girl (not to be confused with the expensive Hula Grill at one of the beach hotels) on the side street on the side of the park closest to Diamond Head and WRH. If the waitress calls you 鈥減retty lady鈥?or 鈥渉andsome man,鈥?you鈥檙e in the right place. The waitress alone is worth the 5 minute walk! The food was very reasonably priced compared to other places.If you like the TV show LOST, take the Lost tour through Big Kahuna tours. Tom is great!We had great weather - yay!!!!

<Content>OK for the price The stay was pleasant, but the only reason I went there was the lack of room at the Waikiki Prince. For $50 more (plus $12 parking, no charge at the Prince, though the places are limited), it wouldn't be worth it to me. It does have better bathroom, larger beds, and carpet and lots of staff, food, security and such. If you are in the market for a mid/low price place that has some amenities, it's fine.

<Content>You Get What You Pay For This was our first time in Honolulu and we were very disappointed in this hotel. We requested a room on an upper floor away from the elevator and where did we end up? On a middle floor right next to the elevator. They could not change our room for two days. The hotel was undergoing renovations and we were told they would be complete 12/31/07. On 12/27/07 it was tough to tell what,if anything, had been renovated... definately not the rooms. They nickel and dimed us on everything. If you wanted a hair dryer it was $1/day extra. If you wanted an iron, it was $1/day extra. The parking was $15/day extra and there was a problem with the parking ticket and gate everytime we entered or exited. We were finally moved to a different room. There was a slight view of the ocean, but the room itself was still small and out of date. Some of the customer service reps were helpful, others were crabby. The price was reasonable (for Hawaii), but this hotel was not worth the price.

<Content>DO NOT STAY HERE - It is not worth it We arrived late evening after a 10.5 hours flight looking forward to a great night sleep then up and about to explore the next day. When I say we, it was a mate and myself, so we had booked a Twin Room.We were given the key and opened the door and practically looking at the other side of the room. It was a 3m x 3m dog box with 2 single beds in it. There was no room to put luggage and we had to put the chair from the desk on the fridge so we could make some room. You had to step over a bed to get to the bathroom.We complained the next day and were told it would cost extra to upgrade, however there were no other rooms in the hotel.We spent our first day in Waikiki looking for alternative accomodation which we had to find by 11.00am or we would have been charged an extra day.The hotel is owned by an airline and they use it for there staff, hence why there are no spare rooms. Seriously I would not let my dog stay there, look somewhere else.We moved to the Circle Quest, just around the corner, and found that to be great

<Content>Fine Location, Although Noisy My wife and I are seniors who enjoyed our two-week stay in early December very much -- in spite of some rather severe weather. The resort is part of the Ilikai hotel (which also has sold off some of its suites as apartments). We found the nearby construction noise very loud when we sat outside in our lanai, but very quiet when we were indoors. The elevators' reliability was poor. We had two queen beds with a sofa, table, one chair (and a desk with another) and a usefully equipped kitchen. Good bathroom, no bathtub. We got no extras that some others have mentioned; indeed, it was annoying that we had to buy salt, pepper and coffee filters. Beach was a ten minute walk and the Ala Moana shopping center about the same. Hotel staff and the Shell Vacations Club staff were friendly and accommodating. We found the location perfect: the eastern part of Waikiki beach is too heavy with humanity and hucksters for our liking. The hotel needs re-painting and redecorating, but is fair value for the money.

<Content>Value, location can't be beat in Waikiki Loved this hotel.LOCATION: 1/2 block to beach, so you're close, but you save money... not sure if any rooms have ocean views, but it's toward the Diamond Head side of Waikiki. Also a short walk to the park, and to Queen's Surf gay beach. Also just a few minutes to the International marketplace area, Royal Hawaiian, etc... Just the perfect location all around.ROOM: I had an economy mini room, which was only $62. It had a lanai, refrigerator, private bathroom, cable t.v. It was not big, but ok for one or two people who want to save money. This price can't be beat anywhere in Waikiki. The room was clean, but the bathroom needed some updating/upgrading.The hotel had a coffeeshop/restaurant I think called Ilima... and on Friday, Saturday and sunday nights, they have a great prime rib buffet for only $16, with salad bar, dessert, fruit, etc. It was really good. You won't beat that price anywhere in Waikiki. The hotel is run by Korean Airlines, and has a Korean Airlines checkin desk in the lobby for those passengers, which could be an amazing convenience for some. The staff were all polite and friendly. The air conditioning was great in the room. No ocean view, but an amazing value. I booked directly on their website. I think the regular sized rooms are about twice the price, probably still a good value. The economy rooms are adjacent to the elevators, so you can hear a little elevator noise, but it didn't bother me at all... it's really quite minor. There was a nice sized pool, but the ocean is better.They had all the usual bell staff, even a small spa. It's a one minute walk to the Hyatt, but that's about four or five times the price.

<Content>An absolute bargain! Stayed at the WRH from the 8th to the 14th Sept 2007.Our room was clean and cheap, which is pretty much all we wanted. The hotel is central to everything you want to do whilst in the Waikiki area...they are working on the hotel at the moment, but we wern't inconvenienced in any way - they shut the water off for a few hours the morning we were leaving, that's all.If you're looking to save some money, this should be your choice. Are you going to Hawaii to spend time in a hotel room? If so, choose somewhere else. If you want to be out and about, this place is just fine as a base and a place to sleep.Waikiki itself is VERY busy and commercial, if you're imagining an island paradise, i'd say definitely spend a few days or more on the North Shore - at the Turtle Bay Hilton. There are still plenty of natural activities to do close by to Waikiki, but due to the amount of people around the area, you aren't likely to be alone.

<Content>Great value My wife and I have stayed at the Waikiki Resort for 10 days at a time for the last 5 years. The staff has always been professional and friendly. The rooms were always clean and well kept. This hotel is owned by Korean Airlines, so you see their flight crews here a lot. With taxes this room was around $100 a night.A two minute walk to the beach to see a beautiful sunset. For the price you get a big bang for a buck. This place is in the center of every place. The bus stop is around 100 yards away on Kuhio Ave. Our favorite restaurant in Waikiki is Duke's Canoe Club. With what we save at the Waikiki Resort we can have dinner here every day and still spend less than most.Looking forward to being back in February and staying at the Waikiki Resort.

<Content>Mid-level hotel, OK for a short stay The lobby area of the hotel is nice and welcoming. However, once you get into your room, you notice that there's a bit of wear-and-tear in the furniture and the bathroom. The bedsheets and towels are clean but they are a bit worn out as well. It is clear that the hotel was once glamorous but with the passage of time it has been allowed to slowly decay. I stayed there in June, which is the low season for Hawaii because it is summer in the northern latitudes. The price of the hotel was not cheap but not very expensive either (approx. US$95), which allowed me to spend the money saved on hotel for other things like entertainment, good food, and Aloha shirts. The hotel is in a great location: it's one block away from the beach and there are numerous shops and restaurants nearby. Since I spent most of my time outside and not so much time in the hotel room, I ignored the lack of luxury of the hotel. Overall, I recommend this hotel for a few nights but don't expect much in the way of creature comforts here. By the way, there is no internet connection in the rooms, but there are computers in the lobby area where you can use the internet for US$7/hour.

<Content>nervous after reading reviews We arrived early and I thought we were going to have to leave our luggage at the desk till we were able to check in. But we were able to check in early, we were also upgraded to a room with a partial ocean view, plus we could see Diamond Head The room had a microwave oven, sink, Dishes and silverware were also supplied in the room.The room was clean, beds had new mattresses. They cleaned our room almost everyday. If they weren't coming in the next day, they would leave extra towels. The staff were friendly and helpful. Yes the elevators were a bit dirty, and yes there was duct tape around the rugs in the elevator But you aren't going to sleep in the elevators! The place is a bit dated. They were in the process of renovating while we were there. But let me tell you!!! You can't beat the location, 1/2 block from beach, shopping, restaurants, and the bus stops all near by. The Catholic church is only a 1/2 block away. Next trip plan on staying here agian. Our trip was taken April 2007.

<Content>Cheap for Hawaii, but it's not worth it Checking in - slow since they only had one person staffed at the front helping people. The person who did check us in was almost brusque in that she really just wanted us all out of her hair. She never smiled once, in fact, no hotel staff ever smiled at us. The room - It is VERY dated, white varnish furniture from the 80's. Everything was clean, but cheap and uncomfortable. The first problem came here - the bedding had holes in it. We called to ask for new bedding and were told that they could not accomodate that. That's all they said, and anything else I said was given a response of we can not accmodate that - as if that was all the English she knew. Second problem - the gauge for the AC, or the thing that lets you control how cold it gets in the room did not work. we turned it to one end and did other stuff for half an hour and nothing changed, then we turned it to the other end and left for 2 hrs and nothing changed. We called about that and they said they could get someone to come and fix it in two days. We were only staying another two nights and so just said they can do whatever they want.Third problem - the fridge, the old mini-fridge that they said their rooms would have. well, they had one. it just didn't work. we asked for them to take a look at it and maybe fix it and surprise, they sent someone to look at it. well, the person said that we were right, it didn't work. but they wouldn't be able to put another one into the room for a week or so. On the plus side - they did a thorough job of cleaning the room everyday since we did track in a good deal of sand.The location of this place is GREAT.The parking in the place is really tight.We weren't expecting much, mostly b/c it was so cheap, but what we got was even less. Next time, we will spring a little more to be a lot more comfortable.

<Content>Good Quality Inexpensive Accommodation My wife and I have just returned home to Australia from a week's stay in Honolulu. We booked our stay through a local travel agent, and I must admit, the only brief I gave the agent was that our accommodation should be central and inexpensive. He came back with the Waikiki Resort Hotel and a price - I duly looked the hotel up on their web site; it looked ok, so I confirmed my ok back to the travel agent.About a week later a friend referred me to this web site, and out of interest I looked up this hotel. After reading some of the less than complimentary reviews I 'll confess to becoming worried about my decision to stay here.However, I'm happy to report that for the most part, our hotel stay was enjoyable and we experienced no problems with our room or the service.If you're considering shelling out your hard-earned on staying here, then what you'll get is a clean, well serviced room, in easy walking distance to the beach, restaurants, bars and public transport.The rooms are of good standard (if a little dated) for what this is (3 star accommodation) - if you are expecting a room that is the standard of the Sheraton et al - then you will be disappointed - its not 5 star, and doesn't advertise itself as such. The hotel caters for all, but is heavily reliant upon Japanese and South Korean tourists, and as such, the restaurants and staff are skewed in their favour. None the less, I found the staff to be courteous and helpful.I note that someone else made a note about the pool - I can confirm that it isn't heated and is extremely cold - I'd suggest you confine your aquatic activities to the beach - the water is warmer there.If you're a first timer to Hawaii like we were, I can recommend day trips to K'uoloa(not sure of the correct spelling) Ranch (Horse riding, quad bikes and 4 wheel drive tours) and the all day snorkelling and whale watching catamaran cruise on the K'Olina (once more, not entirely sure of the spelling) which was great value. The guys operating at the tour info desk next to the car rental desk in the lobby should be able to help you.Good quality affordable dining that I'd recommend (and within easy walking distance) - Lu Lu's Wakiki Surf Club, Dukes, Cheesebugers in Paradise.

<Content>Fair Pricing! We were there for a week. Two couples each with two small children. We booked adjascent rooms and it was as if the other family wasn't there. I never herd their kids they never herd ours. The thing that was no very pleasant was paying for outrageous parking price of $12 per day. Also if you enjoy a swim.. think again. the pool was a very uncomfortable cold temperature. Especially for our 2 year olds. Which choose not to go in. No heater  it sits in the shade. Beside those two things, pleasant stay. A bit dated but comfortable. And we were lucky enough to be there after the new Hawaii Smoke Free Law..So our room was not smelly. Close to the beach, far from noise. Great stay for price.

<Content>They stole my laptop I stayed here for a week in July. Went out for the day swimming and came back to find my laptop and mp3 player missing from my dresser drawer. The hotel as much as admitted that the chambermaid stole it, as it had been a problem in the past. Funny thing when I checked in, they asked if I'd like to spend two more dollars a day on a room safe. When I asked if they had been having problems, the receptionist said; not at all. At the time...when I was standing in front of them, they said that their insurance company would contact me at home. Well, it's 3 weeks later, no contact, no returned calls. $1200. is probably down the drain. The staff at this hotel are crooks!

<Content>Waikiki Resort was nice I was skeptical about staying here  nearly cancelled our reservations after reading the reviews. Much to my surprise, the hotel was perfectly fine for our visit. The hotel staff were incredibly hospitable assisting us in every way possible to make our visit pleasant. The hotel hallways  rooms are a bit dated with needing some modernization. However, everything was always kept clean and neat. This hotel is in an excellent location near many restaurants, shops  tourist spots. The beach is convenient  easy to get to.

<Content>Ok till 3 months later !!! My husband and i stayed at this hotel in April-May of 2005. We went for 1 week on our anniversary. Looking for a budget trip and accomodations this hotel fit all the bills. The staff was very helpful  nice. Rooms were clean if dated  small. 1 block from beach and close to EVERYTHING !!! Now the bad part. 3 months after returning we found out that we had a bedbug infestation in our bedroom at home. Through much inspection, cost and treatment we found the culprit to be from our travel bags that we had stored UNDER OUR BED at home. The bags were crawling with the bedbugs. Needless to say, anytime we check into a hotel again we will strip the bed and do a thourough check before we unpack or lay down. I know that bedbugs can be in all levels of hotels and resorts however when I contacted our travel agency we were told it was past their 30 day  Fix time  so they were unable to help us in any way. We will always check the linens and mattresses before we stay at any resort or hotel again. I hope this helps any other unsuspecting travelers.

<Content>Would not stay at this hotel again ! Non Smokers beware !!!18 out of 19 floors are smoking rooms. If you really want to stay here without the smell of stale smoke then demand a room on floor 9. I say demand as we were told that even though we booked months in advance our request for a non smoking room was not guarenteed. If we knew that before we would of chose another hotel. As we had our 9 year old with us we were not prepared to put up with the smelly room so after argueing our case we eventually got a room on the 9th floor. I was shocked that they even considered putting a family with young children in a smoking room. The location of the hotel itself is great for the beach and shops/places to eat but everything else was a bit of a let down. No kettle, hairdryer in the room or things that in most hotels come as standard. Small bath and I mean small. The cost of this hotel for 7 nights was more than we have ever paid in LA for 14 nights. We never stay in the big expensive hotels but we do expect some kind of standard where we do stay. Unfortunatley this hotel definatley was not worth the money we paid.

<Content>Ideal location, no frills, clean room This hotel is one block from the beach, and in the center of Waikiki, the shopping/restaurant/hotel mecca of Oahu. At the time I booked, it was about $50 less a night then anything else I could find in Waikiki.Based on it's price and reviews here, I didn't expect much but I'm happy with our experience.Rooms were clean and just fine as a place to sleep and clean up for our next activity. It was great being able to walk to almost everything, including an evening hula show put on by the city every night on the beach right down from the hotel. The bus stop is a block away.

<Content>Very Dissapointed! Just arived back from Hawaii after an 8 night honeymoon, we stayed at Waikiki Resort Hotel and was very dissapointed. Things that we could consider 'basic' ie. kettle, tea and coffee making facilities and hair dryer were not included! We were previously told that we would get an upgraded room as it was our honeymoon, only to be confronted by an extremly rude staff memember at the checked in desk (which is not want you want to remember as your first impresession of Hawaii after a 10 hour flight)who stated that is not their policy. We also had a run in with the security staff who threatened to tow our hire car away, (we accidently parked it in the wrong location) then were accussed that we were trying to steel the car and weren't staying in the hotel! We both LOVED Hawaii, and will be back.. but will NEVER stay here again, as all the other reviews mention, it is a great location, that's the only good thing I can say about this hotel!

<Content>Good budget hotel, not for lounging My husband and I stayed in Waikiki as a 2-night stopover to the Big Island. As many of the reviews mention, the Waikiki Resort Hotel has a great location, just a short walk to the beach and a few blocks from the city's bustling tourist center. It is pretty evident the hotel caters mainly to the Korean traveler--especially groups--although they treat all guest with the same friendly manner. There's a hotel store stocked with items labeled in Korean, alongside your usual sundries. There's a Korean restaurant, Seoul Jung (they have karaoke), and an unremarkable cafe, Ilima Cafe, which serves American and Asian fare (neither restaurant appealed to us). Our non-smoking, city-view room, which we paid $85/night, was on the 9th floor. We noticed problems with the elevators. They worked, but were inefficient--one time we waited for several minutes as other guests started to accumulate around us waiting, and by the time it came, only a few of us could get into it. Not a problem unless you are trying to catch a tour bus. The room was your basic budget room. No real extras, but we did have a small lanai. There was a safe in the room, but it was an extra charge of $2/day. Bathroom was very tiny, not uncommon in Waikiki with a shower/bath. But forget about taking a bath, unless you are Mini-Me. We didn't spend much time in the room. There are 2 ABC stores within a couple blocks where you can stock up on anything. Great restaurants are within walking distance. The bus stop is conveniently around the corner. The hotel has a business center, but we couldn't print anything from the Internet. If you want free Internet, there's the Coconut Cafe around the block that offered free Wifi. All in all, we would recommend Waikiki Resort to budget travelers and those who won't be spending much time in the room.

<Content>Great Location We spent 5 days at the Waikiki Resort Hotel. It is not fancy.. but it's clean.. we had a lousy room looking over an apartment building behind us.. we didn't go to spend time in the room..The rooms were clean, in need of an update... the staff was extremely friendly the whole time. The manager of the Ilima restaurant gave us free appy's as it was one of our parties birthday...Pool was on the small side.. but it was wet and cool! The location was worth a million bucks.. can't beat it.. a small block from the beach... McDonalds on the corner for breakfast.. Overall it was a great stay.. I'd stay there again.. we paid less than 90 dollars a night.. again, it wasn't fancy.. but it was all we needed!

<Content>OK hotel close to all nightlife and beach OK hotel would be a 4 star if they would let you check in your room early 3:00 check in means 3:00 after traveling all day you want to go to your room and rest. Front desk was also a little rude. House keeping was great. Hotel is close to the beach and all night life. other wise we had fun and would stay at this hotel again (good 4 the price) just dont plan on doing your laundry there cause all washers and dryers are broke

<Content>Great location, pleasant staff! This is our fourth year in a row staying at Waikiki Resort. Yes the rooms could use some updating, but who goes to Hawaii to stay in their room? You cannot beat the price for the location. The staff are very friendly and helpful. There are some complaints about a moldy smell from other reviewers, but this is a common problem in many of the other hotels located close to the beach (including the 5 star places). The rooms are clean and the lobby is nice. Which is all you really need when you are basically just using the place to change and sleep. With the money you save on your room, you have money to spend on everything Oahu has to offer. We will definately continue to use this hotel on our yearly trips to Waikiki.

<Content>Terrific Budget Hotel I just got back from a week stay at Waikiki Resort and I must say that this hotel is terrific for anyone who is on a budget! The hotel is only located only a block away from the beach and front desk and all the maids are extremely courteous. The rooms are clean and moderate. I think people forget that this is a 3 star hotel, so you're not going to get 5 star quality, but it is definately above average for a 3 star hotel. The cons of this hotel are the hidden costs for everything...safe, parking, coffee maker, phone, etc. But, the front desks lets you know before you use. I would definately stay here again!!!

<Content>Great Location We just came back from Oahu and it was great. March 3 to the 16th 2005. I would stay at the Waikiki Resort again. Very open and great people to deal with. Look for the small costs, coffee maker $3.00 dollars a day and to use the phone, local call .75 cents and up. Take your cell it will be cheaper. The pool was good, needs more plants and trees? I would recommend using the car rental in the hotel, good pricing and very friendly people.

<Content>Solid 2 rating. We stayed at the Waikiki Resort Hotel for three weeks in February 2005. While we had no major problems I rate it as a you get what you pay for hotel, with it's share of positives and negatives. If you are going to Waikiki and traveling on a budget this is likely a place for you. The hotel is clean and the staff generally friendly. The rooms are cleaned daily and sleeping is acceptable. Although their views are blocked by other adjacent buildings you could see a portion of the beach and the surf from our 16th floor room. The elevators were not consistently fast or slow, sometimes fast sometimes slow.On the negative side the parking is $10 per night, which is typical around the area though,  do not look for any luxury features here... as others have said, the painting and wallpaper are noticeably patched in places, the furnishings are dated with almost all drawers having broken slides (the drawers fall out when opened), and the AC vents are ultra dusty but functioning. The tub was dinky small so believe what other reviews say. We also found one pay movies was messed up and another started in the middle. The most upsetting was a number of calls, around 20, we made that never went thru we got billed for, at around $3.50 each. I personally heard, thru the comptuer speaker, that it was something to do with Sprint but when the hotel tested it and found the destination was a modem they would not remove them from the bill鈥?a little unseen hidden charge, 70 - 80dollars worth, I guess.I rate it a two stars because that's exactly what it is... o.k with some problems. I'd probably look elsewhere if we go again.

<Content>GREAT LOCATION CLEAN, COMFY, AND CLOSE What more can you ask for? 1/2 block to the beach, great places to eat and shop just around the corner. I don't know what people were complaning about? Our room was a clean average looking room with a view of other buildings. There were many Koreans at this hotel but that did not bother us at all. The desk agents were friendly and helpful. We paid $100 per night thru expedia and we were right by the beach. I loved Oahu. Defitnely rent a car and drive out from the city to see the beauty of this Island, Waikiki reminds of downtown L.A. Anyways I defitnely recommend this hotel if your'e on a budget and want to be close to the action..If you're on a Honeymoon please spend a little more and stay at the Hyatt or at the Outrigger.....ALOHA....

<Content>Pleasantly surprised I had read all of these horror stories about this hotel after booking and was very nervous about what to expect. We went for Christmas 2004. We were given a room on the 16th floor. Sure we had a hotel in front of us, but what hotel there doesn't have that? We still had a nice view of the ocean that the kids could lay in bed and watch the surfing in the morning. We also had a clear view of Diamond Head. The room was clean..and always cleaned very well each day. I could be picky and say they missed painting in spots or didn't wallpaper properly. But the room was clean, the beds were comfy, the staff was wonderful - in more ways than one. They were always willing to help out - from the right bus to take, to where to pick up a few groceries, and even down to the bellman helping secure a surfboard into our rental car on our way to the airport. The elevators were always fast - my kids noticed that. We never had to wait more than a minute for one. I would most definitely stay here again.

<Content>We loved it! The location is the number one benefit to this hotel. The beach is only half-a-block away, and everything else you could want is within a short walk. The staff is wonderful, from the helpful front desk personnel to the friendly bellhops to the exceptional housekeeping staff (who would go out of their way to help guests). The rooms are typical hotel rooms, clean, neat and comfy (I swear the beds were new - we haven't slept so well in ages). The in-hotel restaurants weren't to my liking (the cafe seemed empty most of the time, though the food was good and the service quick; the Korean restaurant on the second floor seemed a bit expensive and was definitely geared to the Korea Air crews regularly coming into the hotel) - but then anything/everything is so close by. I would stay here again without hesitation, and recommend it heartily.

<Content>Avoid if you can, good location is all it is.. Well if i was Korean this would probley be great place tostay, it is geared mainly for this market.The rooms are run down, reminds me of staying in Poland 20 years ago,,rust in the bathrooms, you get the picture.The food in house is again Korean which is not mypersonal taste. It is cheaper and it is in a great locationand parking is only $10 a day which was good.We are a famliy of 4 and this was our first time in Oahuwhich is disappointing when you compare it to the other Islands. The north shore is great but for us that was about it.Go to the big Island, its great for everything and no highriseswhich are everywhere in Honolulu

<Content>Decent Hotel If you are thinking of going to Honolulu without spending a lot of money, traveling in a budget, maybe this place is for you. It is decent, clean, and the staff is very nice. I stayed in the 14 floor, although is located one block away from Waikiki Beach their views are of other adjacent buildings.It is close to everything. It is a traditional 1970's building, do not look for luxury, you will not find it. It is modest, clean, and safe. The pool is very small, but when you are so close to the beach, why bother with the pool?Make sure you book a Superior Room not a Standard. remember you get what you pay for. Send your kids there with their friends, but if you go with your wife...spend a little more and stay at a better hotel.

<Content>Moldy, hairy and smelly I was mislead by the 3-star rating. The lobby looked great, the rooms looked ok on the internet. Once we got there the first room they gave us had mold growing all on the bottom of the shower curtain and there were many black hairs in the bathroom. The carpet was gross, and the room smelled. After I complained we received a room a little cleaner, smelled a little less and they gave us an ocean view. I would never stay here again. The only redeeming value is the one block from the beach.

<Content>Awful--vacation nightmere This place was horrible. The pool was green. The carpet was so dirty that you were afraid to walk on it with bare feet. The paint was peeling from the ceiling in the bathroom. The staff did nothing to rectify the situation. We left the hotel early to stay somewhere else.

<Content>could not check out because of hotel.com no refunds for early checkout policy Positives:-excellent location-decent lobby (must have remodeled it)-relatively cheap for Waikiki standardsNegatives-airconditioning is centralized so it is very hot in the room.-bathtub very small-room stinks-front desk staff and bellmen are not the friendliest folks-very old hotel

<Content>Very good service We weren't sure about this place but booked it anyway because of the price... but we were surprised by the quality of the staff who were always smiling and trying to help to give us a good stay. And it was really well located too, only a few steps from the beach and two fastfood restaurants (McDonald and Jack in the box), which we find usefull for a quick breafast. By the way, their Korean restaurant had really good food for a fair price. We will certainly come back here if we return to Waikiki.
