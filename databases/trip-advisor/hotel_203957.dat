<Content>Old Charming Hotel, Great Location This hotel is on the banks of the River Arno about a 5 minute walk from the Piazza S Croze, 5-10 minutes to the Uffizi Gallery and about 15 - 20 minute walk to the Duomo. We were on a biking holiday and they had a separate garage area where we could store our bikes for our two night stay in Florence. The hotel is old and at some point the rooms may need updating, but despite that it had a lovely old charm feel to it and was probably quite grand at some point in its past. The hotel owners / staff were very friendly and attentive and it had quite a family feel for a largish hotel.Our room had a bath, minibar and TV and overlooked the River Arno onto the greenery beyond on the south bank. It was also a fair size. The only complaint I would have is that there was a lack of plug sockets, and the one that was accessible didn鈥檛 work meaning that you had to use the plug in the bathroom to charge things up, which didn鈥檛 feel that safe to me.There was a good selection at breakfast including breads, fruit, cheese, ham, cereals and yoghurts.

<Content>Felt Like Family at Hotel Privilege My partner and I stayed for 2 weeks in August 2008 at the Hotel Privilege, located along the Arno in Florence, Italy, having discovered the hotel (through comments on TripAdvisor.com) last year, when we stayed for a week. Somewhat east of the main tourist area (the Ponte Vecchio and the Piazza della Signoria), near Santa Croce, the hotel is effectively cut out of the corner of a very large historical building and comprises probably about 20 rooms, all of them kept immaculately clean and neat. The host and hostess, Emanuele and Barbara, are fantastic: they make you feel like family (in the best sense) and go out of their way to help you plan your activities and ensure, insofar as they can, that your stay in Florence is as enjoyable as possible. Their recommendations on restaurants, sights, activities (e.g., bicycle tours), etc. are very helpful, but most of all they treat you like a welcome guest in their home, not just another number. They serve a wonderful continental breakfast with a wide selection of cereals, fruits, breads, cold meats, yogurt, jams and jellies, hard boiled eggs, and of course juice and coffee. If you wish, you can eat breakfast (or take coffee or tea later in the day) on the open air terrace of the hotel that is shaded by an old giant wisteria bush. The smaller, upper level of the terrace, up a short flight of stairs, has a view of the river. While the rooms are not of luxury standard, they are nicely decorated and have either outside views (some of the river) or give onto a small, upper inner courtyard (very quiet, and where we chose our rooms both years). The room rates are reasonable, too! We would (and will) return to Florence just to visit this wonderful small gem of a hotel and this extremely gracious and friendly couple, even if there were not other reasons for returning!

<Content>most welcoming owners As an ex- travel agent I am very aware of the importance of research. Trip advisor is a tool I used at my place of work and continue to access for my personal travel arrangements.The Hotel Privilege was one of two hotels i was considering - I know I made the correct choice! It's easy to ascertain the location and facilities of a hotel but not always as easy to gauge the customer service. This was exemplary and the entire stay faultless. I intend to return to Florence and will undoubtedly book my stay at the Priviege. I have high expectations of accommodation and have been fortunate to stay at some world class hotels. Although this hotel doesn't charge or offer a 5 star status, I wish to convey my opinion that the customer service is certainly worthy of such a rating. When away, regardless of cost, I expect a clean room with comfortable bed and enough soft towels. The size of room is relevant depending on individual situations. At the Privilege, our rooms although not huge, were certainly not small; with so much site-seeing, we weren't in our rooms other than to sleep. The fixtures and fittings and the breakfast certainly surpassed my expectations. Our experience really defined the word hospitality. Compared to other cities such as Rome, Venice, Seville, Dublin, Munich and countless others, this was by far the best value city break I have ever experienced.

<Content>Comfortable  We stayed at the Hotel Privilege for 3 nights in the middle of July, based on the reviews we had read on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed and I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Florence.The room was the largest we had in Italy, and we chose the room with two twin beds. They were long and extremely comfortable... after staying at 3 other hotels with harder mattresses, the nice mattresses were a welcome relief. The room was clean and very quiet (I'm very picky about this so I had requested, and we were given, a room that faced the courtyard). The air conditioning was plentiful (very important in the summer) versus other hotels that controlled how low you could set the temperature or only allowed A/C after a certain hour. The bathroom was also larger than all of the others we experienced, including the shower stall. The TV was larger, too -- I would guess about 27 to 32.The staff was very friendly. They helped me change a restaurant reservation without my even asking them to make the call, gave us directions, and answered all our questions. They were knowledgable and helpful, and their English was good.The breakfast was the most impressive we'd seen during our trip, including (but not limited to) plenty of fresh fruit, rolls, croissants, dry cereal, meat, and my favorite, smoked salmon. The orange juice and coffee were good.The hotel is in a great location on the Arno, a 5 minute walk to Santa Croce and 10 minutes to the Ponte Vecchio. One of our favorite restaurants was La Giostra (recommended also by the staff). I would recommend eating indoors -- the ambience is quite nice (we ate in the room on the left, if you are facing the entrances). If you are weird about salt, stay away from the veal ossobucco... it was a bit salty... but everything else was great. Keep in mind they do not offer wine by the glass, so be prepared to order a bottle or choose something else to drink.We took the train to Siena one day, and it was a pretty easy and inexpensive trip. If you do this, I would recommend walking from the train station in Siena to the sights (Duomo, Piazza del Campo). It's about a 15 - 20 minute walk, and whereas you can take the bus, it's a bit confusing as to where to get off, and not many people speak English.Side note: I would not recommend Italy in the summer. I've heard August is bad because many shops are closed for vacation, but July is very hot and humid. We found Florence to be less humid than Rome or the coastal town in Southern Italy we visited, but it was still quite hot.

<Content>Hotel hosts make the stay excellent The hosts at the hotel, Barbara and Emmanuelle, made our visit like staying with family. They were extremely helpful with restaraunt suggestions. They also have a nice breakfast. It was a pleasure having an after dinner drink and talking with them each evening.

<Content>The Staff Makes it Wonderful Right on the Arno, a short hop to the Oltrarno, where a lot of the better dining and nightlife exists. They have a fine breakfast, large rooms, very comfortable.The real draw are the two wonderful proprietors, who make you feel like a member of their family. They can truly help with anything. For the price, this is a really fantastic place.

<Content>You're family, not merely a guest, at this wonderful establishment Owners Emmanuele and Barbara are the consummate hosts. We felt like family, not merely another foreign couple in Florence for the first time. While the hotel amenities are luxurious, their personal attention is peerless, whether explaining directions, planning an itinerary or securing a restaurant reservation.Not to be missed!Mike and Audrey Borschel,Fishers, Indiana

<Content>A Super Hotel Just back from 7 nights in this hotel. We selected the Privilege on TripAdviser scores. It lived up to its excellent reputation. Small (18 rooms, I think) but giving above average space to each room. It seems ideal for adult couples, being too small for large group bookings. Superb location on River Arno, it is out of the very busy and very noisy central area, yet is within easy walking distance of all major sights. Our room faced inwards to the small courtyard and was pefectly quiet. River-facing rooms might get more traffic noise.Spotlessly clean, elegantly decorated and much-loved by the owners, it was a delight to stay here. Hotel breakfast was excellent - fresh, generous, unhurried. The owners were happy to speak English and to help with our halting Italian. Very helpful with advice on museums etc, and especially with suggestions for restaurants. Do go to 'Ristorante del Fagioli', just 400m from the hotel - the best value (eating out is expensive in Florence) and most helpful service we found anywhere.Other tips: Trains are outstanding value and the best way to visit Sienna, Lucca, Pisa etc. Pisa Airport to Florence is best by train. We used the Terravision bus to return to airport: it worked well. Electric buses in the city are great value and endless fun. Museums are an organisational and curatorial disgrace, but staff are charmingly helpful. March is good: the city must be an overcrowded, over-heated nightmare in the Summer. The AA 'CityPack Guide and Foldout Map' (拢6.99) worked very well.

<Content>Great little hotel in a wonderful city Wonderful little hotel only 10 minutes from Ponte Vecchio, right on the river Arno. Location is near two bus stops. Hotel owners were always available and especially friendly (English speaking). Owners made great recommendations for sites and restaurants. Nice breakfast. Room was reasonable size, although decor was a little dated. Shower was a bit small. Excellent price and excellent value. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

<Content>Quiet, comfortable, best breakfast A spur of the moment decision prompted our stay at this 3 star hotel on the banks of the Arno. Having become accostumed to 4 star establishments, I was very pleased to find that Hotel Privilege, except for the smallness of the bathroom, was an extremely comfortable place to stay. Triple pane window kept the very spacious, clean, room perfectly quiet. It is in an ideal location, within a short walking distance to all major monuments and eateries. Large comfortable beds made for a good night's sleep. Very well heated, appreciated on a chill November night. And, the breakfast was superior in quality and selection to that of the 4 star hotels we stayed in.

<Content>Right on the Arno River This hotel has the most delightful host and hostess. They are a married couple who seem to always be available (don't they ever go home?). We felt most welcomed every time we came through the door way. The breakfasts were super! Boiled eggs, tortes, cheese, lox, fruit, juices, yogurt, espresso or cappuchino, milk, sliced meats--with encouragement from the hostess (You eat nothing!). A patio under the trees outside overlooks the streets. We could not get lost because all we had to do was to find the Arno river, look for a tall landmark, and there we were, home for the evening!They even made several long distance phone calls at no charge so that I could recover my driver's license that I had left as security at a bicycle rental shop a few hours south of Florence.Our favorite room was 110, it opened onto a small interior patio, so we would sleep with the door open and not hear any of the outside traffic.Very comfortable beds and nice bath.Tell Emanuele that the California Sisters sent you!

<Content>Wonderful small hotel on the Arno River. Wonderful small hotel on the Arno River. The managers were very helpful and could tell you just where to go and what to see. Breakfast was wonderful and the service was too. The room we had on the water had a wonderful view of the river, but it became a little warm for us with the windows and shutters closed since the AC was off (some guests thought it was getting cold, but we鈥檙e from Alaska). We were moved to an interior room the next night and all was well since we could let a breeze blow through. I would recommend this hotel to anyone in this price range.

<Content>Hotel Privilege, a splendid place to stay Hotel Privilege is well situated for visiting Florence. We stayed with a group of ten people for four nights, and found the accommodations comfortable, the breakfast excellent, and the hospitality of Barbara and Emmanuelle to be warm, gracious and helpful.Hotel Privilege overlooks the Arno about three long (long) blocks up river from Ponte Vecchio. It is also handy to the neighborhood aroundPiazza San Ambrigio, which has my favorite outdoor market and shops. The rooms included air conditioning, which was welcome even in late September. The beds were comfortable, and the rooms good sized.I can't speak highly enough of the service Emannuelle and Barbara provide. They both speak English, Emannuelle more that Barbara. They were happy to help us with directions, reservations, cabs, and information.If you do visit, tell them Tom  Erin from California say Hi!

<Content>Truly a Privilege Emanuele and Barbara Toccafondi make sure that you leave Florence (and Italy,generally) with the memories of a lifetime. They provide a level of service that I can only imagine regular visitors receive at the finest hotels in the world. These proprieters have intimate knowledge of Florence (and all places reachable by day trip). They help with decisions as if you were an honored family member, and then do the legwork of printing out train and boat schedules, and even checking on weather, making for stress trips that are tailored to you and your family. The hotel is right on the bank of the Arno within walking distance of the Uffizi and the Ponte Vechio. Our room was spacious, well-appointed and clean, and very comfortable for a family of four. Our two boys (6 and 8) were treated like Princes. The breakfasts were plentiful, fresh and delicious. Our stay was a privilege we will not soon forget.

Although our room was a little worn, it was very clean and comfortable. The buffet breakfast was excellent and the coffee is the best coffee in all of Europe!

<Content>Pleasant Privilege Stayed at the Privilege for 2 nights in August 2007. Well located for the traditional areas of Florence, the major sights were within comfortable walking distance.The proprietor and his wife were very helpful, he especially spoke good English.The hotel is very traditional but clean and well furnished - the only complaint with our room would be that the shower area needed refurbishing.The buffet breakfast selection was excellent, plenty of choice and continuously replenished - however the breakfast room was small so you may have to wait for a table.The rack rates are quite high but if you can get an internet booking deal the hotel offers very good value for money.

<Content>Nice Place We stayed 4 nights in this hotel and it generally lived up to its reputation from other reviews. The hotel is well situated, just away from the busy areas and right next to the river. It鈥檚 an easy walk to all the attractions.The rooms are well appointed and clean. The breakfast is good by continental standards, particularly the fresh fruit and Tuscan ham. The service from the owners is very personal and attentive. For example, we developed a small leak in our shower and this was sorted quickly and with no fuss.The slight downside for us centred on our room (108), which was quite small for a double bedroom. It also housed the main aircon unit for the hallway in its roof space which was quite noisy until we worked out that where the hall thermostat was situated and turned it up. There is also a bit of road noise. Overall, we only paid 95 euros a night for the room through the [-]website (below the hotels rate) and so this may have accounted for their room choice. Certainly others we viewed were much bigger room, more in line with the experiences mentioned early.Overall, it is a nice place and a safe bet for an enjoyable visit to Florence.

<Content>A Little Gem! We have just returned from a week in the lovely Hotel Privilege! Everyhing you have read in the above reviews is true. The hotel is in a great location on the banks of the river Arno, well within walking distance of everything. The hotel is spotless, our room was so spacious as was the bathroom. We had 2 air conditioning units but didn't need both as the room was quite cool anyway. Bed linen and (large fluffy!) towels were changed every single day. The breakfast was the best I've seen in Italy; tea/coffee, crackers, cereals, fresh milk (not UHT!), salami, ham, tomatoes, boiled eggs,cheese, loads of croissants, bread, a toaster and fabulously juicy fresh fruit!Tribute simply must be paid to the marvellous hosts Emanuelle and Barbara. They really do go out of their way to ensure you enjoy your stay in Florence. They booked us tickets at Ufizzi and Academia, advised us on sights to see and just took a genuine interest in us. We are both in our 30's and would certainly recommend and stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel Loved this little hotel. Great location on the Arno.The rooms are clean and ours was a nice size facing the river. The breakfasts were excellent. Probably the most outstanding feature of the this hotel were its managers, a husband and wife team. They were friendly and helpful. Their restaurant recommendations were on the mark. I asked them to recommend a restaurant to celebrate my husband's birthday. They called the restaurant and reserved us a spot where we were to have the best meal of our trip.The hotel has high speed internet access for those wishing to bring their computers.I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat.

<Content>This is the place to stay in Florence This is the hotel in Florence. Located near Santa Croce on the Arno river. Rooms are very large for Europe. We stayed in room 302 and had a 5 foot double window that opened into their private garden area, where we enjoy afternoon drinks and breakfeast . Every possible tourist site is within a short walking distance. The owners Barbara and Emanuele make you feel as if you are one of the family. The moring breakfeast is done with class and quality. Rooms are very clean and has large bathrooms. When we left this 3 star hotel we went to Rome and stayed in an expensive 5 star hotel. Well keep your 5 stars it didn't compare. This is a quality hotel run by two professional warm people. Don't make a mistake, save money and stay in a wonderful hotel. This is the only hotel we will stay at when in Florence

<Content>Warm hospitality My husband  I went through all the reviews for this particular hotel, and decided that we would like very much to find a friendly staff, who could give us advice and inside information.And I am very happy to report that the staff exceeded all our expectations. They gave us directions how to reach the hotel by car, were expecting us at the hour mentioned by us [we didn't make it, were almost 3 hours late...], took care of our car and were more than happy to give directions even to a mall outside Firenze. The room was big and quiet, as we requested, and the breakfast was copious. We liked the location by the river, even if they don't have double rooms facing it. It was an easy walk to all the main attractions. Highly recommended !!!

<Content>Great location, friendly staff We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in March. Despite the weather not agreeing with us the hotel was excellent. The location, right by the river, is beautiful was a nice easy walk to all of the attractions.The staff were very friendly and made some excellent recommendations for dinner. Our room was large and the bed was huge.The breakfast was OK (coffee not that good) but it was the location, good level of cleanliness and friendly staff that makes this such a good choice.The price was very reasonable and if we were to return to Florence we would definiately stay here again.

<Content>Lived up to all expectations Stayed 3 nights. Very friendly and helpful management. Great size room and bathroom, away from the river side so no view. It was clean and quiet, a/c worked well. Large comfortable bed. Buffet breakfast was a great start to the day. Walking distance to all attractions (less than 15 mins going the long way). Would stay again without hesitation.

<Content>Exceptional Hotel, great location. What can I say about this hotel ? Its simply great and the Manager, Mr. Emanuele is an outstanding gentleman. The rooms are among the biggest you will get in Europe at the price. The breakfast is superb and adequate. And the view, superb. If you chose a room with river view, you will get some noise from the traffic but closing the glass windows at night was enough. Whatever minor deficiencies this hotel may have is made up by the kind behaviour of the owner, Mr. Emanuele Toccafondi. He will quite simply help you with everything, from a problem with your room to arranging your plans for sightseeing in perfect order. The hotel is also in walking distance to most major attractions, the Ponte Vecchio, and Santa Croce Church.I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. I've read great reviews of the Hotel David, but everytime I go back to Florence, I'm staying at Privilege for sure.Overall, if you book here, you will not regret it.

<Content>Found this jewel by accident Recommended and booked from our hotel in Cortona. Good find.Excellent value for the price. Large rooms, comfortable beds, good location, quiet. The rooms were much better than the price indicated. Parking nearby for a 13e fee.The best part was the manager (Emanuel) and his wife. Fall over backwards nice. Good breakfast also. I think it's a 3 star hotel but don't worry about that at all. Great place. One of the few real values we found.

<Content>Great hospitality! We visited Florence for our first time and found that Hotel Privilege was great. The rooms were large and clean . The breakfast was excellent. The location was very convenient to the main tourist areas. The best feature was the hotel owners who were professional, personable, and extremely helpful. We felt as if they cared that our experience in Florence was wonderful - and it was.

<Content>Wonderful break, loved the hotel- great value for money We arrived to a very warm welcome. Staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. We had a quiet room to the rear of the hotel which, although we had no view of the River Arno, did not matter because there was no traffic noise. The room itself was large and spotless - with a sofa bed and large shower room. The continental breakfast catered for all tastes - wide variety. The hotel also had a small garden one could sit in. We stayed 6 days.It was only a few minutes walk to see the sights and into the centre of Florence. The hotel was situated beside the river - 5 mins from the Ponte Vecchio Bridge. If going back to Florence in the future, we would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Excellent Small Hotel -- OUTSTANDING MANAGERS Hotel is 10 minutes scenic walk along the River Arno to the Ponte Vecchio and Uffizi Gallery. My single room was comfortable and well-appointed. I chose a room away from the Arno to avoid noise although other guests told me that the rooms facing the Arno were quiet enough. It was hot in the city but the hotel air-conditiohning kept things very comfortable. The included breakfast was outstanding and generous with many excellent choices including fresh fruits and hams and cheeses. The absolute best feature for me was the kindnesss and patient helpfulness of the managers, Barbara and Emanuele who always had time to answer questions, check timetables online and even print them out for me, make phone calls, give good advice and make recommendations. Excellent value for the money!

<Content>I'm surprised.... I'm surprised by all the good reviews this hotel got. Besides the location, which is good, it is pretty lousy for the price we paid. it was so loud at night, that we couldn't sleep until 3am plus the room was horrible. I must say, it was big, but everything felt like it was falling apart. It was clean, but that's about it. We thought it was a nightmare and even the owners couldn't compensate for that. Sorry, but we would never chosse this hotel again.

<Content>really great hotel My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Privilege for 3 nights - our first visit to Florence and we came as tourists for sightseeing in Italy. The hotel and staff were exceptionally nice and the hotel was good value for money. The rooms were a good size, clean, comfortable and with aircon (very necessary). The location is perfect and an easy walk to the centre. The staff were extremely helpful and accomodating and helped us to arrange an onward travel itinerary and booked cars and hotels for us. They make an excellent breakfast here! Would recommend this place if you are looking for a good quality friendly 3 star hotel in a great location.

<Content>It was our privilege The Hotel Privilege was a great hotel! Such a wonderful location on the River Arno and within walking distance of everything in the historic part of the city. Rooms were suprisingly large by European standards.The owners/managers couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. Made us feel like we were staying at a friend's house rather than a hotel. Breakfast spread was better than many upscale chain hotels. With the price of eating out in Florence (Firenze) the inclusion of breakfast made the price more than reasonable.Highest recommendation. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+++++++++ (like ebay).
