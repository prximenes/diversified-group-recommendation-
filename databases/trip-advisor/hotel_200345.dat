<Content>What else could you possibly need? Booked this hotell online and then read a few reviews on here which were negative to say the least, so we were a little apprehensive when the time for our trip arrived.But the previous reviewers must have been mistaken or staying in a different hotel (or just plain nitpickers) because the Hotel Belmondo was as perfect as it gets!Spotlessly clean, very big rooms which look to have been recently refurbished, location is perfect, no problems with traffic noise, staff courteous and friendly, hot breakfast buffet excellent and available up to 10.30am for the late risers, rooms cleaned (properly!) every day - need I go on?If I was to try and find something to improve at the hotel it would be the provision of tea and coffee making facilities in the room and the addition of extra pillows, but copmplaining about something like that is definitely nitpicking!Would stay there again like a shot. We booked the hotel via the internet and got 3 nights for 拢114 on a special offer, normal rate is 129 euros per night so not a bad deal at all!

<Content>OK hotel. I was going to stay at Boulevard hotel, but they overbooked me!! They managed to find a room in Hotel Belmondo, half a block away from Boulevard hotel.Its is an old hotel that has been renewed some years ago. Its spacial configuration is a little bit weird and take a lot of walk to get to some of the rooms, in particular those in the right wing (worse if you have lots of luggage). The staff is just professional, not friendly.My room was more like a pod, extremely small (beware, all the rooms located on corners tend to be that small). Everything seemed a little improvised and the noise from the street (Ku'damm) was very loud. It was clean, though.The positive thing about the hotel is it`s location, near Zoo Hauptbahnhof and the best shopping area in Berlin. And it has free wi-fi internet connection on the lobby too.

<Content>How did they get the extra star? We stayed in this hotel when my husband was running the Berlin marathon. We had previously stayed here about 3 years previous in it's former incarnation as the Comfort Fruhling. It was a 2 star hotel then so not overly disappointing - at least we knew what to expect! The 'refurbished' Belmondo is now a 3 star, but I really can't see why they were re-graded. The entrance and lobby of the hotel is fine, although the tacky plastic chandeliers let it down, however I'm fairly certain that our room was in the same state as our previous trip - the stains on the carpet looked that old at least. Our room size was good, with nice high ceilings and windows that faced out onto the K'damm. It's a shame that there is no aircon, as to have the windows open to get some air means it becomes very, very noisy. The bathroom is tiny, although the shower pressure was fine. The worst part for me was the bed - two iron frame singles pushed tgether. I don't mind that, however when one bed is approx 15 cm higher than the other it becomes something of a joke. Breakfast was fine, but it's not hard to get a continental buffet right. Staff were mostly ok, however when we asked for an iron and an ironing board (these are not supplied in each room), they were able to provide the iron but no board. My husband ended up pressing his shirt on a towel on the floor, and 30 mins later we had a call from the front desk stating that they 'had lost the ironing board'. This was our third trip to the city, we love Berlin, but do yourself a favour and stay elsewhere (The Alsterhof is good).

<Content>Great location, shame about the hotel This hotel is in an excellent location, surrunded by great shopping, nice restaurants and bars and walking distance to 2 train stations and a bus terminal. The rooms are large, but ours had no airconditioning and although it was not very hot, the rooms were stuffy and necessitated opening the windows which unfortunately led to a loss of sleep since the hotel is on a very busy road. Expedia had this hotel room at a 3 star property, I'd say its more like a 2. If you are looking for an inexpensive hotel in a good location, this is the place for you. If you are looking for a comfortable stay in a well adorned room, this place is not for you.

<Content>Great Location but average hotel Great location but nothing else than average. Looks better from the outside than it really is. Small rooms and it can be a very long way to the room fro the reception. The hotel is big! I was not satisfied with tha fact that I couldn't have my room until 15.00 even if I were there 12.00. The room was ready and just waiting!Close to Bahnhof Zoo tough.

<Content>So-So I would recommend that for the money, stay at another Berlin Hotel. It was not up to the standards of the price. We lived in Berlin several years ago and took our daughter back for her H/S graduation. The look for hotels in Berlin became so overwhelming that we just settled on Hotel Belmondo because of it's location and thought the extra price would be worth it.Wrong! The room was okay, but the floor was disgustingly dirty and it was sweltering hot at night. The claim of recent renovation must not have included carpet cleaning. The room opened to the Ku'damm and the windows did an excellent job of sound proofing the street noise. Also, Our room was 1/2 a block from the desk and there is no other usable exit. Just not worth the money, stay somewhere else for the price!

<Content>location is the only good thing it's got going for it This hotel is in a great location in Berlin, I'm sure every single other review will rave about the location. However, that's really the best aspect of staying here. If you are planning to stay here, one very important fact about this place is that THERE IS NO LIFT. So if you have heavy luggage then this is going to be problem, not even after you check in, but starting from before you even enter the front door. The front door is already up quite a few stairs, we had very heavy luggage and boxes as we were there for many days and had to bring work materials for the exhibition. Don't expect any help with your luggage as there is usually just one staff behind the desk and no one at the door. After we entered the front door there were more steps you have to take to get to check-in. The one staff that was there and was not occupied with anyone didn't feel the urge to help us eventhough we were going back and forth to get our things and drag them up the stairs to the check-in desk. We arrived at 6am and had booked rooms for the night before so that we would not have to wait until 2pm to be able to go in to the room and shower after our long flight. First thing the check-in staff did after seeing our names was tell us off for not checking in the day before or informing them. I explained to them that we meant to do that, that it was intentional, as we needed to check in at 6am so we were happy to pay one whole night for a few hours. She still thought it was ok to tell us off like we had done something wrong, that they could still sell those rooms had we informed them we would not be using them the night before we landed. I mean, why is she having a problem with this??? We paid for those rooms and we can use them or not use them as we please!! We weren't trying to avoid paying for that night or anything. We were completely aware of what we were trying to do. And if she was trying to sell those rooms that we had paid for and get double the amount by sneaking in an early leaver or something... well then that's pure dodgy. The room itself was ok but not great. Bathroom is literally 2 by 2 metres, so it's a tight squeeze. Only bathroom amenity was the soap/shampoo combo that is fixed on the wall. Shower cubicle could not keep the water in there so if you don't want to flood your room don't shower for too long. TV is about 12 inches max, might even be smaller. Pillow was was weird, was shaped kinda like a donut from the bottom up and was really uncomfortable. Also, you can get very well acquainted with the friendly neighbours here as I even heard the people next door doing it one night, quite loudly and clearly, just as I was getting to ready to go to bed. No internet available in the hotel, the only way is to use wi-fi and pick up T-Mobile's hotspot signals, which you can pay for, but it's very expensive. I do go to Berlin every year and will not be returning to Hardenberg again. Last year at Hotel California just down the road was much better, especially given that they were the same price.

<Content>Superb location We stayed at this hotel between the 26-29/11/06. It is in an ideal location for sight seeing and public transport. I would highly recommend the walking tours which meet out side the Zoogolisher Garten station. The hotel was clean, warm and the staff were friendly. Breakfast was a bit basic but adequate. No bar on the premises. For what it cost, it was an ideal base. There are loads of shops and restaurants within a 5 minute walk. Checkpoint Charlie was a disappointment, they torn it all down and all thats left is a series of hoardings which tell the story. christmas markets were there and worth a visit.

<Content>Great Location, Fantastic Breakfast, Big Rooms, Friendy Staff Well I booked this Hotel over 13 months before we stayed, as they accepted a booking for the dates for the World Cup which we had been notified that we had back in May 2005. It was purely down to the fact they would accept the booking so far in advance and that they did not hike up the price for the World Cup. Location is perfect, right next to Zoo station, which is a hub for the main public transport system in Berlin. Buses 109 or X9 get you straight there from the airport for 2.10euro each and 1.40 for children. The journey takes 15 to 20 minutes. The Hotel is only 2 or 3 minutes from Zoo Station and as it's the last stop for the 109 or X9 you can't fail! Check in was quick and staff excellent, even gave my 6-year-old son a World Cup Teddy Bear! Staircase and lobby very impressive! Our room was on the 2nd floor and each room has the advantage of being down a locked corridor coming off the main staircase - this gives additional security as that means you have to use two keys, one to get into the corridor and one to get to your room. Rooms were large and beds big and comfortable. Bathroom large and like the room everything very clean and well maintained. TV had 46 channels including CNN and BBC World. Breakfast was really excellent. I've stayed is many many hotels much more expensive than this one, but this breakfast was superb. Service from the staff was excellent in the breakfast restaurant too. Location for shopping could not be better as the main shopping street in Berlin only 1 minute walk away. Check out the Karstadt Sport shop opposite, this has to be one of the biggest sports shops in the world! The Zoo is right across the street too and has 15,000 animals in there. The Restaurant on the top floor of the KA DE WE departement store on the main shopping street has some wonderful (and cheap) food and fantastic views across the city. All in all a wonderful hotel, fantastic location and can truly recommend you stay there.

<Content>Excellent hotel. The only downside to this hotel is the lack of a lift.Otherwise it is great.The standard room was of a good size and simply furnished. The bathroom was rather small but nice.Both were modern in contrast with the rest of the hotel.The reception (1st floor), the staircase leading to it,and the breakfast room are from a different age.They are all magnificent.Breakfast was good with a wide choice and enhanced by the surroundings.The location is convenient for transport links. The airport bus 109 stops at the door and the express service X9 stops at the Zoo Bahnhof 200m. from the hotel.Excellent value.

<Content>Great Location My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hardenburg. Hotel was clean, staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a cold buffet plenty choice.The rooms were hot as no air conditioning but if you get a room at the back you can open your window and there's no noise.The location is perfect for the train stations, the shops and restuarants. I would stay here again as the hotel is perfect for a city break and the location is so good.

<Content>Not recommended A great disappointment after reading the previous reviews, the location is good but the cramped room was not worth the Euro140 rate a night. The shower cubicle leaked water all over the bathroom floor, the pillows were lumpy, constant traffic noise during the night, empty cola bottles on top of the wardrobe and a basic breakfast buffet which kept running out as not being replenished without reminders. On a positive note the staff were very friendly. Overall i would only recommend this hotel for half the rate I paid.

<Content>Great location The Hardenberg rooms are basic, but its location close to Zoo is ideal for getting around. The breakfast is a must and the variety of food offered in the breakfast room is amazing.The 109 bus from Tegel airport stops outside the hotel so the transfer from the airport to the hotel couldn't be easier.Rates are decent for a city centre hotel in such a prime location.

<Content>Great Find! Stayed here in June 2004. Wonderfully located with easy access to transportation (Zoo Station) and within walking distance to major attractions. The hotel is clean, quiet, and the room we had was large by european standards (vaulted ceiling and large marble bathroom). The staff was friendly and courteous. However, when venturing out for the day you must leave you room key at the front desk. Will definately return.

<Content>Stay here :) I stayed here in Dec. 2003. The hotel is located very near the Zoo Train station and Kiser Willhelm Church. The staff were very friendly. There are several bars and restaurants near, as well as a post office across the street. The interior reminds me of an old office building redecorated as an old German hunting lodge (I mean that in the best way possible). The subway and city train is near to the hotel. I would stay here again and would recommend this hotel to anyone.
