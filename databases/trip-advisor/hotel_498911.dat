<Content>Better than expected Following some of the negative reviews of this hotel, I thought it important to put some people's minds at rest. I guess it depends on your expectations, but being from the UK I would compare this hotel to a Travelodge or a Holiday Inn Express. If, like us, you were forced to book an overnight in Puerto Rico due to AA's crazy scheduling times, then this will be a perfectly fine bed for the night. The rooms were clean and the service courteous and attentive. We had a young baby and the crib arrived within 5 minutes of us entering the room. The location is incredible if you have an early morning flight the next day, which can be invaluable if, like us, you're on the Miami flight which was very busy. The food in the restaurant was fairly average but we weren't looking for gourmet. As for value for money, well you're in the Caribbean so all places seem to apply a premium for that. You will doubtless find Best Western hotels for cheaper in the continental US, but if all you need is a place to lay your head and a shower between arriving in PR and flying out the next morning, then this will do fine. If you want a luxury hotel for the night then this isn't the one for you.

<Content>Nice Hotel We have stayed here at least 4 times since flying from the West coast always seems to land us in SJ late. Therefore, it has been easier to just book the BW at the airport and leave out early the next morning for one of the islands. While I would agree that the hotel is overpriced by regular standards, an airport hotel is always more expensive regardless of the class of the hotel. We have found the hotel to always be clean, the little restaurant with good sandwiches (and several Caribbean beers), and the breakfast as good if not having slightly more offerings than similar hotels. Maybe some of the poorer reviews have been due to being bumped off flights, etc. and being little testy! The beds are a little firm but then that is a personal preference and for me and my wife, they are fine. The drawback and the appeal is the airport. Certainly no view and not much ambiance but other than the price, it is what you would expect from a Best Western, clean, convenient, good service. If anyone booked this hotel for an extended stay, then you deserve what you get, however, it is certainly fine for an overnight stay (unless you are teed off by other circumstances!).

<Content>If you're paying for a room, go elsewhere! Due to mechanical issues with our plane we missed our connection home and American Airlines put us up here for the night. The hotel is conveniently located in the airport. Unfortunately it's not convenient if you have luggage since there are a few steps down into the lobby. We had a room with one bed on the 4th floor. The room was New York City small -- possibly even smaller! Our room was clean but our bathroom still had a slight smell of urine. The walls were paper thin as we could hear our neighbors all night long and in the morning we could hear their alarm. The flat screen TV was tiny but it did the job. We seemed to have a variety of channels. The windows in the room are right above the bed so the light from outside comes right on your face which I found an annoyance when trying to sleep. The AC was one of the best I've encountered in the Caribbean!! It kept the room quite cold -- almost too cold! The complimentary breakfast was decent as it had a large variety of items. The hotel restaurant didn't have much to offer but it was convenient. I wouldn't pay the room rate for this hotel unless you're on a very tight schedule. San Juan has plenty of better rooms!

<Author>OO
<Content>Very Pleased at what we found. I am so surprised to read these negative reviews! My husband is a Hyatt GM...we've stayed in lots of hotels, most of them pretty nice, and I think I'm fairly discerning-- I was favorably impressed with this hotel, in fact surprised at what we found, considering it's a Best Western!Like most here, we were put up by AA, after our flight from Grenada left 12 hours late and we missed all connecting flights. We arrived in the hotel at 10 PM, my daughter and I, plus her 1.5 year old baby, after a horrible 12 hr. day in the Grenada airport. I didn't expect much...a bed to sleep in and not much more, before our flight out the next morning.We cleared customs and lugged our paraphernalia a fair distance to the hotel. the (6?) steps or so down to the lobby was a nuisance as we had a lot of luggage. Someone wasn't thinking when that configuration was planned!Check-in was smooth...asked for double double and got it. Requested a crib for the baby. Imagine my surprise when the crib was delivered to the room within 5 minutes of our getting into it!! Having been operating on island time for the past week, I had no hopes of seeing it before we went to bed. The room had two queens and still enough room for the crib and for us to move around. Decor was fine, reflecting a recent renovation.A wall hung flat screen, albeit a small one, was a surprise as well. We were too tired to turn it on, so can't comment on reception or # of channels. Bathroom was very nice with the newish bowed out shower rods and rainforest showerhead. Rooms were well enough soundproofed that we heard neither noises from the airport nor from other guests in the corridors. Coffee available in the room and actually fairly decent tasting.We had breakfast vouchers...had trouble finding the dining room and am not sure we were in the right spot, but we could walk in the keyed door. It reminded me of the club level at Hyatt, with a simpler breakfast selection. There were boiled eggs, sweet rolls, banana bread, bacon, toast, cereals and fruit...way more than I expected.Overall, it is heads and shoulders over any Best Western I've ever been in, and we were very pleasantly surprised and impressed with the level of amenities. That hotel was the only good thing about our entire trip home!Word of warning to others: even if you cleared customs the night before as we had, you must go back through an agriculture check where luggage is xrayed then given a sticker, PRIOR to check-in at AA. If you don't, you'll be sent back to get it done. When you walk out the lobby it's the opposite direction from AA check-in. It's quick and easy...just be aware that this is a necessity.

<Content>Glad I didn't pay for it! We stayed overnight in the best western becuase AA missed our connecting flight. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone- I am just glad that AA paid for it. We will never stay there again- even if given another voucher from AA- but- hopefully will never have to miss a connecting flight again.Bad1. Very hard bed- horrible nights sleep2. Tiny TV - good picture if you can see it!3. Wake up to sun light- aweful! The curtain (closed) is right over the pillows, and light streamed down onto our faces. Unless you slept head down (at the foot of the bed), you cannot prevent a face full of sun early in the morning! Yuck!4. Resturant- certainly didn't feel like one. Just a couple of chairs it looked like in a somewhat sectioned of the hotel- across from some guest rooms.5. Had to carry your luggage down a set of steps to get to the lobby- highly handicap unfriendly, and just annoying for the rest of us6. Rooms were tiny7. Absolutely would not give us a late check out. We had to hang out in the airport for 6 hours.Good1. Resturant had decent food- very poor selection though2. did not hear airplanesNeutral1. did not check out the sa2. did not use casino

<Content>Convinience at a price After traveling to PR out of an emergency, my wife and I tought that staying in this hotel the night prior to boarding our flight to NY would be a good idea. First the price is all a reflection of the location. That is what you are paying for. The rooms are small, the TV is a small flat screen 13 in tv on the wall. The beds are very hard. No room service, the restaurant is just a counter with a toaster over, a microwave and a hot plate. The bar is just liquor stacked up with someone to watch over it all. No parking, except airport parking, and no discount for it at all. During our stay, the water went out, in the middle of a shower. The only thing this place has going for it is the location, but the embassy suites is right in front of the airport, and will be our next choice during the next trip.

<Content>Convenient and Comfortable This is not where you want to spend your vacation, but for an overnight booked and paid for by the airline that didn't hold your connecting flight, it's just fine. It's a $20 cab ride to Old San Juan and the check-in for American Airllines is literally just outside the hotel doors. As noted, rooms are small and basic, but for sleeping and bathing, perfectly adequate (well, the water could have been hotter). The free breakfast was passable and the business center had 4 computers available, making it easy to alert everyone back home of our delay. I would not go out of my way to stay here, but as it was on my way, it was acceptable.

<Author>RDPWiltshire_England
<Content>Convenient: Yes. Good value: Questionable Even with a facelift inside, this is still fairly basic accommodation with a distinctly 1960s motel feel about it. The price is definitely not from the 1960s!The biggest selling point is the location - literally part of the terminal building! In fact, if you are flying American Airlines, their check-in desks are a few yards from the front door. The main airport parking, the taxi rank and the car-rental pick-ups are right outside.The biggest downside is also the location! Not a very scenic location, nothing to do and nowhere to go, unless you like airport food outlets and the cheesy hotel casino (a couple of rows of slots). We couldn't even see the runways! A flight change meant we unexpectedly had to spend two nights here, and without a rental car we would have been crawling up the walls with boredom!We did try the free rooftop Spa... two hot tubs and some sun loungers with a 10ft. non see-through fence around it. Surreal! With a view of nothing but the sky directly above we bathed to the sound and smell of jets taking off and landing!The rates are inflated to reflect the location. Anywhere else the rates would look like very poor value. The rooms were no better than I would expect from a basic, but clean out-of-town motel. The bathroom was clean and the linen was good quality. The TV was tiny and had a fairly limited range of channels.We had a late evening flight and asked about day rates. Personally, I think $125 for 9am-5pm is ridiculous! At least they put our cases into secure storage for no extra charge. We opted to save the money and sit in the terminal reading!

<Content>Convenient, bot not for apPerson in a wheelchair First of all, this is a nice hotel. Every inch is freshly painted and wallpapered. And it is convenient to airport travelers. But it reminds me of when I was a kid and would get a toy that was made in China. It looked good, but upon more careful inspection, it had little problems here and there that just drove you crazy. And this hotel had a few delights too.1) They have a wake up service, just like any full service hotel. But they also have alarm clocks that you can mess with if you're bored. They guy next door checked out, but he had set his alarm clock to go off AFTER he left. We had to call the desk, and they promptly came up and shut it off. Ridiculous.2) They gave us a room on the sixth floor. No problem. Until we realized that they must have added thee sixth floor onto a five story hotel at one point. We had to take the elevator up five floors, then walk down a short hallway, turn the corner, then board another elevator to go to the sixth. Not bad, unless you're tired, impatient, drunk, etc.3. Free wireless access on one of their PCs in a small PC room. Very nice.4) Without going into needless specifics, it is very difficult to deal with this place if you are in a wheelchair/scooter, especially if you are traveling alone. Once you find out the ins and outs, its too late.5) Few planes take off or land at night. But when they do, you can hear them. But they aren't flying ten feet over the hotel, so it's not bad.6) I thought the continental breakfast buffet was above average.7) Each room has a flat panel TV, which is cool. But it is about the size of your pillow. (Obviously, they are not trying to wow you. They just don't want to take up space in the small room with a table/dresser and TV.8) I was satisfied with the staff.9) The bar/cafe was sparse, and didn't really look like a bar or cafe. Maybe it wasn't enclosed enough. But they had real drinks there. At one point, they had one staff person for each person. I think the Asian guy was making sushi.We stayed here because we were coming in off two flights to make a cruise. We didn't want to do a lot of further traveling. Next time, we may stay in Old San Juan instead.

<Content>Good for a night we stayed here after british airways messed up and made us miss our cruise. we managed to get flights to san juan where the ship would be the next day and we followed the signs at the airport to this hotel. The hotel was very clean and the staff were very pleasent. when we got there it was the night shift but they sorted us out quickly. the next day we had to call the cruise line and they let us use their phone at reception. The room was small, but very clean, internet access and flat screen tv. bed was comfy and bathroom nice.Breakfast was a bit poor, but i have had worse, there were yoghurts, bagels, bread, croissants, cereals, toast, juice etc. Enough to keep you going till lunch, which is the whole point of breakfast.It was a welcome hotel for us and the predicament we were in. we were glad to have found it. the next day we left and caught the cruise ship, but the staff couldnt have been more helpful, even finding us a taxi.

<Content>Hostel type accomodation How anybody can say that this is an OK Hotel amazes me. The lobby is shared with a noisy slot machine arcade, the rooms are basic beyond belief (ours was directly uner the control tower) and the breakfast would have disgraced a youth hostel. If you feel that this is a worthwhile price to pay for convenience after a long flight, then OK, but check out other Hotels-there are plenty of decent international Hotels within a ten minute taxi rideof the terminal. Perhaps its only plus point is that it would be great for aircraft spotters. When I opened the curtains in the morning, I saw a Convair Metropolitan taking off. Didn't know any of these are still in service-it was the first aircraft I ever flew in-in 1957!

<Content>I loved this hotel................ it's da bomb!!!! Staying at the Best Western Hotel in the San Juan Airport was one experience that I will never forget. Actually, I would like to thank the American Airlines for screwing up our flight arrangements and placing my family there for the night. Although it was the night shift, the hotel staff was extremely pleasant and that's a rare case and I commend them for that. However, I was disappointed with the dinner menu. When I got to BJ's Bistro at 10 o'clock, I was told that dinner would be served until midnight. So, I expected to see on the menu food items such as baked chicken, rice, salad,etc. To my disappointment, I was told that I can only have a sandwich as if that would be considered dinner! I didn't complain. I ordered a mozarella chicken sandwich with potato chips. Yes! I said it potato chips! I was expecting french fries not chips you get out of a tin or bag but the sandwich was delicious. Now to the actual rooms. I must say the rooms are of the best: well made, nice, big, comfortable beds with beautiful, clean linen. Don't even talk about the tv. Flat screen in a hotel?........ Nice touch but I was upset because there were limited channels. Overall, the room was good but the soap was too small. After one bath, that was it. No more soap. What cheapness is that? Anyway, I slept well the evening. In the morning, there was a buffet breakfast. That was the best breakfast ever! Eat all you want? Beautiful. Just Beautiful. Breakfast was limited but it was still ok at the same time. After breakfast, I said goodbye to the beautiful hotel and it's lovely service.Generally, I enjoyed my stay and I would recommend that anyone reading this, visit this marvelous hotel

<Content>Its not much, but its clean We missed our connection home and were forced to stay in San Juan overnight. AA put us up at the Best Western, which is in the airport. They boast a casino, but in reality it is nothing more than some slot machines and a few table games. The rooms were very small and the TV was tiny, but would do for a night. Our first room had a smell to it, but our second room was fine. It was quiet considering we were staying at the airport - I don't think they have many flights leaving after 7pm or before 7am. In all, it works if you don't have any alternatives.

<Content>Only if you have to! There were two groups of us arriving in San Juan. One late Friday night (midnight) the others early Saturday morning (5:00am). We did not want to bother trying to get a taxi to take us to Old San Juan at our arrival hours, so it seemed like a perfect idea to stay in a hotel right at the airport. One group also had a departing flight a week later from San Juan at 7:00am. So we booked the hotel for 2 nights.We felt our arrive worked out well. However, we all agreed that we paid alot for what we actually got. A small room, small TV etc. But we were only there for a few hours. After we became more familiar with the San Juan, we realized that the airport was not really that far from Old San Juan so we cancelled our second reservation and stayed in Old San Juan the last night.Knowing what I do now, I would have stayed in Old San Juan our first night as well as our last night. It was an easy, inexpensive ($19.00) cab ride to the airport. We stayed in a better area and in a better hotel for less money. I also believe that we enjoyed our last night in Puerto Rico even more as a result of the change of hotels.

<Content>Have an early flight? We stayed here earlier this week, partly because of the favorable reviews in TripAdvisor. I don鈥檛 understand how a hotel with so little going for it is rated so well and can charge $200 a night. The rooms are ultra small and ours smelled of disinfectant. If you want dinner in the hotel, you will have to settle for cold food. (The restaurant did offer to put a cold sandwich in a microwave.) In my opinion you should stay here for one reason only 鈥?a very early flight.

<Content>Convenience is its key asset We stayed at this hotel for one night. You get less for your money here than at other hotels, but we were happy to pay to avoid the hassle of returning the rental car and finding the airport for an early morning flight. The room was clean -- neither big nor small. There is wireless internet access in the rooms and a business center with internet access as well. There is a hot tub, but no pool. The television is a rather small flat screen mounted on the wall. All in all, I would not stay here for long, but it's a good place to lay your head when you are either just arriving at or just leaving San Juan.

<Content>Clean and convenient for short layover One night layover on the way from JFK to British Virgin Islands. The hotel is literally in the airport. Reception was friendly and efficient. Room was tiny and FREEZING COLD - we ended up turning off the A/C and fan completely in order to get it to a more comfortable temperature. Beds were fine, very small TV, spotless bathrooms. Small sushi restaurant in hotel was below average - take along some healthy snacks from home and wait until morning for the typical continental breakfast, which includes hard-boiled eggs.I would only stay here for one night, but I must say that the management has provided a very clean, quiet (!), and well-run, convenient place to stay for a brief layover. Twin-bedded room cost approx USD $230 for one night, with taxes.

<Content>As expected - perfect for quick airport stay We stayed here for one very short night. We had reserved here because we knew we were landing late and leaving the next morning. Thought it would be the most convenient and it was. Was even more convenient when our flight was delayed 5 hours and we arrived at 3 a.m. Lots of people sleeping on the airport floor since no rooms were available in San Juan (think Jet Blue ice storm on East Coast--a mess).Room was clean. Bathroom and t.v. were very small. Beds comfortable and no airport noise. Breakfast was fine for continental.Biggest complaint: they are renovating SJU so we awoke to jackhammering at 7 a.m. (which stunk given that we'd only just gone to bed!).Would stay here again if I needed a quick airport layover.

<Content>Great for where it is located If you are vacationing in San Juan, DO NOT STAY HERE. That is not who this hotel is intended for. If you have business at the airport, or need a one night layover, this is the place. We checked in at 10:45a and our room was ready for us. Overall, we had this room for less than 24 hours.Here are the plusses:It is in the airport. You can't beat that. It outweighs just about every other amenity one can imagine. Complimentary wireless internet, business center and traditional continental breakfast. Room was very clean and well appointed. Staff was extremely courteous and friendly.The minuses:A single 15 or 17 LCD mounted on the wall. Too small, and some channels were fuzzy. Restaraunt. There is a place called BJ's Bistro in the hotel. When we went to look at the menu, all they had was Sushi. Not our kind of food, so we started to walk around the airport. Mind you, it's 7:30p. All the restaurants in the airport were closed except for Taco Maker, Subway, and McDonald's. Casino was very small and didn't have poker tables.Overall, would stay here again to finish off my trip like this time. However, if I were actually vacationing in San Juan, I would choose elsewhere.

<Content>Fine for a night Pluses: It's IN the airport. Couldn't be more convenient. Quiet, even though you're looking at the runway.Minuses: The rooms are tiny, furnishings are sparse.Basically, if you have a layover, it's fine, but no reason to go there otherwise.

<Content>OK for a night or two I was put up overnight when my flight back home to St. Croix was cancelled. Overall the stay was OK. The front desk was very kind and courteous upon check-in. The rooms are small and my particular room felt a bit like a jail cell. There was only one small window and the room itself was narrow. The tv was a small flatscreen on the wall waaay across the room from the bed - had to squint to see it. However, the room was clean and tidy and a decent place to sleep. Check-in at the airport was EXTREMELY convenient in the AM as you just walk out the door, up the steps and you're at the check-in counters. I wouldn't stay there for a vacation, but for an over-night into or out of the Caribbean - it wasn't too bad at all.P.S. I left a brand new pair of jeans in my room, realized it and contacted them later that day and they sent them to me with no problem. The woman I spoke with at the front desk was very helpful and prompt.

<Content>What a pleasant suprise !!! We had a last minute need to book a hotel close to the airport. The BW Airport was a pleasant surprise. We arrived around 1am and received a warm greeting. The rooms, although small, were immaculate and the property was well cared for. I called to get a later check-out and received it without a problem. The continental breakfast was excellent, I just wished I could have stayed for the evening reception. At first I was taken back to hear the price per night for the property, but after my stay I confirm it was well worth it.

<Content>Who would have thought As part of an airline crew not expecting to be spending the night in San Juan and then finding out that we had been put up at a Best Western, we felt we had been given a one-two punch!! What a pleasant surprise to find an updated, clean, quiet facility. They have a business center with 4 computers and a printer available at no cost, a fitness center that had enough equipment to satisfy anyone, a pool table and ping pong table and a large room set up with tables and chairs for the complimentary continental breakfast with coffee, espresso, capuccino, tea and juices available till 11:30 pm. In the evening they had alcoholic beverages and sandwiches available at reasonable prices. A pool, hot tub and washing machines and dryers are also available. It was a $10, 10 minute cab ride to the beach. Overall a very pleasant experience. Hotel staff was very cordial and informative.

<Content>Perfect This is a great little hotel. It could not be more covenient for an overnight SJU layover. It was clean, newly redone, quiet, easy check-in  out and great continental breakfast. I have always hesitated to layover in SJU but this worked out so well and broke the travel up. I would highly recommend it.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Quiet, good service, and located at the airport, this hotel was very comfortable. Although the rooms are small by North American standards, people who have travelled in Europe will find the room to be a familiar size. Very modern, with a desk and chair so I could do my work, easy access direct from the airport terminal. Quick shuttle to the airport rental car office made it a snap to pick up my car and drive to my destination. Perfect for anyone who needs to spend a night near the airport on the way to another destination or cruise.

<Content>Very Convenient--Great if You Have an Early Morning Flight! My husband and I stayed here the night before our departure to return home to New Orleans. This is the place to stay if you have an early morning flight. The rooms are small but well maintained. This hotel is conveniently located right IN the airport. You just need to wake up, grab a complimentary croissant and check in for your flight. Definitely recommended!
