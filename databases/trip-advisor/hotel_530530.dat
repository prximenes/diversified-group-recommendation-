<Content>Do NOT stay at this hotel! We stayed 2 nights at The Payogan for our honeymoon at the end of August. We arrived to receive a very slow check-in, after which we were shown to our garden villa. Our room had a terrible odour with all the bedding covered in mould and stains! You could smell sweat through the pillows and we had to lay our beach towels over the bed to sleep on. The robes were stained, and the in-room safe wasn't even bolted down so could have been taken away by anyone.Our outdoor bathroom had a large spiderweb with a spider sitting in the middle over the shallow bath, which the staff did nothing about getting rid of.There was a rooster right near our room that crowed from morning til night.The restaurant served what tasted like canned spaghetti  2 minute noodles, and was very slow and staff just chatted amongst themselves rather than wait on us. The buffet breakfast the first morning was ok, but the 2nd morning they provided less than half the buffet options.We booked activities through the hotel, which they told us were confirmed. But hadn't actually been booked, which we weren't informed about until after waiting an hour to be picked up by the bus.The website listed wireless internet connection... not unless you want to sit at the reception desk and use their computer to check your emails!Staff were useless and were unable to assist with any local recommendations of where to eat etc. When we made complaints they barely understood us and made us wait an hour for the manager, who we don't believe listened to a single word.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!

<Content>Beautiful Location, Strane Resort We stayed at the Payogan in January 2008 and found it to be both lovely and inconsistant at the same time. We had a 2-bedroom villa with a private fresh water pool (much appreciated since I'm allergic to chlorine), which was lovely. With the exception of the fact that the upper bedroom had terrible lighting (no chance to read at night), no shower and everytime | ran the bath, it poured water into the downstairs room, it was really nice. Quiet, private, peaceful. The outdoor shower in the first floor bedroom was great in concept, but the mosquitos and rats that one had to deal with for late-night bathroom runs made it all a bit scary in reality.As for the resort itself...we were there during the rainy season, whch meant that only about 5 of the 15 villas were occupied...which should have been great from a service standpoint but really wasn't. It felt deserted and abandoned rather than secluded and specia. Breakfast (included) was okay, but everything had a bit of a day old feel to it. Don't bother eating there at night. Apart from the laughter coming out of the kitchen, there was no rhyme or reason to the food. We ate there twice, ordered the exact same meals and got completely different food each time. Besides, there are so many really good restaurants in Ubud at way better prices, why would you bother?The spa has potential to be really good, and there are, in theory, at least 6 treatment rooms, but each time we went, my friend and I were put together in the same room. Much as I love travelling with friends, I'd really like to have a massage on my own. The resort location was spectacular. Views over the valley through to Mt Agun (the most sacred place in Bali) were unbelievable. And there really is nothing like sitting on your balcony with a thunderstorm rolling through, listening to the monkeys howling across the valley...Would I stay there again? Yes. Would I try to negotiate a better rate? Absolutely. It will be interesting to see what the rebranding to d'Boutique will do for the property.

<Content>Beautiful Surrounding... but Our tour agency (balitraveling) booked us on this hotel, though our original choice was The Maya. Since this place is much cheaper and the photos looked good and remarks generally positive, we decided to give it a try.I share similar remarks with most of the other reviews posted - the surrounding is just so beautiful and peaceful and the main pool is really as beautiful as what you see at the website.Our pool villa is spacious and boast of great privacy. The private pool overlooks the opposite hills, and the pool size is much larger than the Komaneka's or even the Royal Pita Maha. However, I felt that the whole place is not quite up to the mark - the hot shower doesn't work well, water pressure was low, the bathtub and bed linen not very clean, the DVD player didn't work and the qualities of the toiletries provided are not so good. The staff are very friendly but service is a little slow. Oh yes, the shuttle service is too infrequent, so we ended up paying for our own transport from Ubud most of the time (but it is not that expensive - Rp 30,000 per way). For the price that we paid, I think we had a pretty good deal (I think we paid USD100+ per nite). But I like pampering service (i.e. bath oil, high quality towels etc). So, I will probably go for The Maya next time around eventhough it will cost a lot more.

<Content>Disappointing A beautiful peaceful setting in lovely gardens, but this hotel didn't live up to expectations after a stay in the Novotel Benoa which was cheaper and far better. The bed linen was stained, the room was like a mausoleum - huge and bland. With all the lovely art and textiles in the area it would have been easy to brighten it up. The restaurant was expensive and the food disappointing. There was a large hole in the floor of the Ganesha Lounge and some the chair covers in reception were mouldy. The spa was very expensive by Indonesian standards and many of the treatments on offer had been crossed out - we were not tempted to try it out.Most of the staff were very friendly and helpful, but I'm afraid we won't be going back,

<Content>Great Place, Shame About The Food This hotel and its surroundings are really beautiful. We had our own little villa with our own small private pool. There is a great view over a small valley and the whole site is really beautiful with little gardens. The main pool is also very pretty. There is a shuttle service into town. If you'd like to go into town outside the scheduled times, it'll cost you a reasonable 30,000 RP (~ 1.60 GBP). I only can complain about two things. First of all the food isn't great. To be fair we only had breakfast, which wasn't great. It is very strange that there don't seem to be any fresh juices, in a place where you can buy fresh juice everywhere. The ones they have taste artificial and very sweet. The pastries aren't fresh as well. We stuck to the egg dishes, which are prepared fresh for you and are OK. Maybe the sausages and Asian options are better, but we're vegetarians and didn't try them. Also some of the staff don't speak English very well, which can be difficult.

<Content>Good Value, Privacy,  We enjoyed our stay at the Payogan. It was great for us and our 1.5 year-old daughter. We were in a villa/room with it's own pool. Our daughter could actually sleep in a separate room and they included a pack-n-play for her to sleep in at no extra charge. There was always fresh fruit in our room including the delicious, tropical snake fruit that you can't seem to get back in the USA. The views from our balcony and outdoor bathroom over the river valley were breathtaking and very private. Also, the design of the buildings and grounds really felt Balinese.We booked through a travel agency as part of a package deal and were told that if we wanted to extend our stay beyond the 5 nights it would cost us ~$170 US Dollars a night including breakfast. This felt like a decent deal given the spaciousness and privacy of our accommodations and the amazing surroundings. I would rate the property as a 4* resort in 5* surroundings.The staff were very friendly, trying hard, and were quite accommodating, but the service at the hotel cannot really compare to the service at the 5 star Internationally run accommodations on the island. The service felt relaxed and was not intuitive. Also, language was sometimes a issue. However, I liked that the hotel was run by Balinese people. It felt good to be supporting the Balinese economy more directly. Our private pool was lovely and clean as were the room and grounds, however, I noticed that parts of the extensive property are starting to look worn and are not as well-maintained. For instance - light fixtures were broken, stones were missing etc. So far things overall still look well taken care of, but I worry that as time progresses the property might just get increasingly run down. This is something the management really needs to make sure doesn't happen as it is such a gorgeous property it would really be a shame. We noticed that pools were being added onto some villas/rooms which is great. This does seem a bit peculiar though if they are not properly maintaining other aspects of the property. Why build something new if you let the rest go downhill? (BTW - The construction did not bother us at all and we are sensitive to noise)The location was magical as long as you don't mind a short (~10 minute drive) into Ubud. We typically like to stay in the areas surrounding Ubud for a while and then move further toward the center of Ubud so that we have both experiences which are each wonderful and unique in there own ways. The typically free shuttle to Ubud was fantastic and really made it easy to get to town. We would usually then hire a car from Ubud back to the hotel since we didn't want to call for pick-up and wait since we were traveling with a 1.5 year-old. However, the hotel would have been glad to pick us up if we wanted that service. The Balinese food at the hotel was good and the included breakfast was quite nice and plentiful. You could choose between Balinese type breakfast items and American/British items. One complaint is that the quality seemed to vary a bit during our stay. One morning they served us powdered milk instead of the real thing and didn't even mention the change or apologize. I did not try the more American style menu items as the descriptions did not seem so compelling. I figured it was safer to stick to the local cuisine. This also sets this property apart from 5 star internationally run properties that may offer compelling international menu items. There were no other kids at the property, but our daughter seemed very welcome. The resort/hotel definitely has a romantic and peaceful feeling to it and doesn't have activities for children. The place was not very busy while we were there (low season), but it didn't seem like a ghost town. We typically ate breakfast with a couple other parties in the morning.Overall, we would stay there again if they offered us the same deal and as long as the property maintains it's facilties. The surroundings and privacy rival those of the Four Seasons Sayan where we have also stayed (for a much higher price). If you are looking for impeccable service stay at the FS. Otherwise, we have some magical memories of our stay at the Payogan.

<Content>Far from the Madding Crowd The Payogan is almost there... almost great service, almost excellent rooms, almost , but not quite. We spent 5 relaxing days here this month, and came away with a most positive feeling about the resort, and an inclination to return - if and when the place is given a facelift. It is all a bit tired and dated, like stepping back into the eighties. Our villa was huge and overlooked the hillside opposite, with rice terraces and jungle, which was a perfect setting. The room amenities were old and worn, however - all dark heavy wood which at night, given the local propensity for lighting large rooms with 25 watt bulbs, appeared dingy. This lighting design spread throughout the resort, making the whole place seem dim and uninviting.The villas are all stand-alone, which makes you feel like you are the only ones there (this was great, although I think one night at least we were the only ones there!).Each villa has a TV and DVD, although the advertised channels bear no relation to the actual channels showing.Transportation into Ubud is via a shuttle every 4 hours (free) or at any other time at a cost of about $4 - pretty reasonable to me.As a comfortable base for exploring the fascinations of Ubud, or the fabulous restaurants around (Lamak in town, and Mosaic around the corner are truly splendid, world-class restaurants - expensive by Bali standards, but ludicrously cheap by big-city rates), The Payogan is a comfortable, inexpensive and high quality villa hotel. It is not 5 star, but with a little work, could well become one.

<Content>Wonderful, beautiful hotel We stayed in one of the pool villas for 7 nights. It was our second trip to Bali and so we did less touring and more relaxing at this beautiful resort. The rooms are spacious and lovely. The staff took us into town at our request and organized a couple day trips when we requested. A wonderful experience we hope to recreate soon.

<Content>Payogan Hotel/Spa I recently stayed at the Payogan for 3 nights and had a fantastic time and would definitely recommend staying there--especially if you're looking to relax in a secluded location. I was traveling on business w/out my wife (who was a bit jealous) but this would have been a great romantic place to stay.The hotel is situated above a little valley and has very nice views of the jungle and old rice patties. The location is about 12 minutes outside of Ubud. That was perfect for me. I would go into town for a few hours--to walk around or have a bite to eat--and then come back and read or sit by the pool. Getting around Ubud is really easy and inexpensive ($3 US w/out bargaining). My room was amazing. Big, nice view, large comfortable bed (and a separate daybed that was as big as a queen size bed), secluded outdoor shower with separate bath, and a balcony. The decor was very nice as well--cool tile floors, art, incense, and exposed bamboo ceiling.The main hotel had a nice lounge, pool, restaurant, and spa that all had pleasant views. I didn鈥檛 use the spa鈥攂ut it looked as nice as the rest of the hotel. Also, there is no shortage of spas in Ubud鈥攕o whatever kind of self-indulgence you鈥檙e looking for you鈥檒l be able to find it.The hotel staff was extremely polite and everyone was willing to do anything to make your stay nice鈥攚hich is not surprising. I find it hard to believe that you can go anywhere in Ubud and find any unfriendly people.There are only 20-25 rooms/villas on the hotel grounds and they're spaced out nicely and made me feel like I had the entire place to myself.If you鈥檙e considering going to Bali鈥攜ou should definitely check out Ubud. And if you鈥檙e looking for a nice place to stay, I鈥檇 recommend the Payogan w/out reservation.Also鈥攃alling internationally is expensive (surprise!). If your planning on having to make calls, you may want to figure out how to use your mobile (my US phone didn鈥檛 work but my Singapore phone did) ahead of time. Also, if you must bring your laptop (I did not) check ahead of time and see if the hotel that you鈥檙e staying at offers an internet connection鈥?br/>Finally, if your in Ubud and a reliable and safe tour guide that will give you a great tour for a fair price, I recommend using Nyoman Suastika. [-]His English is good and he has comfortable air conditioned transportation.
