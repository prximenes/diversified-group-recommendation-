<Content>Enjoyable I am writing this whilst still in the hotel as I feel that negative reviews on this hotel were not warrented. We booked our stay at the Clarendon after reading their website and checking on Trip Advisor. The reviews here seemed mixed, however we thought we should give it a try, and we are pleased we did. On arrival in the evening the hotel was lit up and flashing blue, it looked quirky and really interesting. (Great touch), the front desk staff were very efficient and helpful and we were given room 423. The room was large had a fantastic comfortable bed, large flat screen TV, fresh coffee machine and all the other normal things you would expect. It was quiet and a very comfortable room. Negative things are the shower which is a bit slow to heat up or ends up burning you. The gremlin in the A/C unit which turned it on at 2am automatically, and we thought a boeing 747 was landing in the room and the window in our room which opened onto a corridor did not have a lock and could be opened with your hands on the glass. The food in the hotel which we had was very very good. The fillet migion was to die for, and we had it on two nights. The pool looked fantastic. The hotel owner obvioulsy has a lighting fettish as the lights throughout the hotel are really cool. Even though the hotel is an old 70's department block building the owners have tried their best to create a modern feel of an outdated building and have done it well. Imagine the Mondrian in LA on a budget but with better staff which are not full of themselves. The roof top bar is a nice touch but looked a bit rough round the edges. The staff were excellent and extreemly helpful. This hotel most definatly has a future, give it a try, you will be plesently suprised!

<Content>Hip, Intimate, Friendly Getaway Even though I live here in Phx., I've treated myself to a few stays at the Clarendon. Why do I do that when I live here? Because it's fun, sexy, intimate, and close to everything! I feel like I'm on a mini-vacation away from here when I'm there! It's almost like being out of town! I've stayed there a few times when friends are visiting and we all want to be together.The rooms are clean, -- the beds are the best I've ever been in! -- and the rooftop bar is the bomb! If you're looking for a great view of Phoenix, this is the place to be! I love the Clarendon! The staff is wonderful -- from the front desk to housekeeping! Personally, I love it here!

<Content>Absolutely perfect stay! I stayed at the Clarendon Hotel so I could be close to the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport, as I had an early flight the following morning. The Front Desk agent at check-in was totally professional, friendly and courteous, couldn't have been nicer. The room decor was very cool and trendy. The room had a great minibar set up, and the bath amenities are top quality. Before dinner I went to the rooftop bar for a glass of wine, there's lots of comfortable seating, the view and the Phoenix sunset from the rooftop was amazing, the hotel's owner was mingling with guests, the atmosphere couldn't have been nicer or more welcoming and everyone was having a great time. The rooftop bar was open late, nice touch for a night cap. Dinner in the restaurant was perfect. I'm vegetarian and sometimes meatless entrees are non-existant in hotel restaurants, but the server pointed out several selections, I was impressed. Loved the food, great service, the staff was very attentive, Wish I'd had time to use the hotel pool, again very trendy, with a unique waterfall and fountains that spray into the pool, eclectic and fun. Check-out was fast and efficient. Great experience, I will DEFINTELY be back.

<Content>what a hip place We stayed just the one night on our way to LA. The hotel is really modern and very hip. We ere there on a saturday night and a band was playing in the pool area. Really different place but lots of fun. The bar and restaurant on site are good and the rooms large. We have free overseas calls included which was a nice surprise.

<Content>A nice little stay! I just stayed at the Clarendon November 5th and 6th for a conference I had in Phoenix. We arrived and check-in was smooth and welcoming. We took the elevator to our room on the 4th floor. I did not realize it was the type of hotel you enter your room from the outside. All of the rooms face in to a center courtyard where the pool is. The room was cute and trendy. I was a little disappointed by the carpet which was office/industrial like carpet. The bathroom was clean, the large plasma was nice and the bed was VERY comfy. We were helped the first night by the front desk staff in finding a place to have dinner. She made a great recommendation and printed out directiosn for us (Barrio Cafe on 16th is very good!) We also sat on the rooftop to have a drink both nights (although it was pretty cold). I must warn you, that you have to go up a flight of stairs to get up there as there is no elevator to get there. The view was nice and the seating and ambience was nice however the bar selection was quite limited and there were no heaters which I would have expected since it was so chilly and they really advertise the bar on the roof. We did not eat at the restaurant at the hotel. Our AC worked fine although it was a little loud and the shower was clean and the water was nice and hot for me. The wifi was spotty at best and it was disappointing because I had a lot of work to do. The staff was very friendly and we had a nice time. I don't know if I would stay there for a relaxing weekend trip but I would stay there if I had a business trip again. I would not suggest it for kids or families though.

<Content>Best hotel I've ever stayed at! When I checked in, the guy at the desk was very nice. I was upgraded to a suite, because none of the regular rooms were clean. He asked if it was my first time, and then explained about their restaurant, rooftop bar, and pool. He held the door for me when I brought in my bags, and offered to help me bring them in.The rooms are amazing. I almost jumped up and down, I was so excited. There are lots of little touches that make it amazing, especially the music that's playing when you walk in. I went out to dinner, and after coming back headed up to the rooftop bar. It was still early, but I joined a group that was sitting up there. Turns out one of the guys was the owner of the hotel, and he was extremely friendly and excited to hear about my stay.Later, I went back to my room to turn in for the night. As other people have said, the pillows are amazing! I got an amazing night's sleep, and was refreshed for my interview the next day. The complimentary shampoo and other items are really nice, as are the robes that hang in the closet.There are a lot of mixed reviews about The Clarendon, but the bottom line is it's an amazing hotel with a spectacular staff and wonderful atmosphere. If you like beige walls and don't appreciate the unique, this is not for you.

<Content>Good stay for a reasonable price in Phoenix We read all the reviews good, bad, neutral and given the price we received from Expedia.com decided to take a chance for our one night in Phoenix. We are glad we did. The woman at the reception desk set the tone when our credit card was denied (out of town travel--not over use!) when she calmed us down and talked us through another credit card (jet lag is my only excuse for the nerves--my husband was calm). Check in was smooth after that and we got to our room to find music playing. It was a biggish room, very clean, with a nice sized, clean bathroom. One little glitch, the air conditioner was not working at 100% as some people have stated in their reviews, but there was a fan in the room, it was early evening so cooler than the heat of the day, so we were comfortable and didn't complain--so we didn't really give management a chance to respond to our concerns. It was dinner time so we asked about Delux Burger which I had read about in other reviews. The woman at the desk quickly printed out directions and gave us her review--great! We had a wonderful dinner at Delux which is about 10 minutes (by car) from the hotel on Saddleback (I think). It is open until 2:00 a.m. and is apparently popular as an after evening eatery, but it was pleasantly busy and very attractive. Upon our return to the hotel we went to the rooftop bar and enjoyed a wonderful view of the Phoenix sky line and the stars. Slept very well, had a nice breakfast in the dining room (we were the only ones there for the most part). I would recommend the Hotel Clarendon for a moderately priced stay and the clean, modern rooms.We took a beautiful picture of the view from the roof top but it came out blurry! Sorry I can't share it with you.

<Content>Motel, NOT hotel This hotel is NOT what its website would have you believe, and it does NOT deserve its star rating.The d茅cor is hideous 鈥?the walls were painted a dark blue/red/purple, and the furniture was shabby. Instead of achieving the mod feeling that they were so obviously trying to achieve, it just looked ugly and dated. The crappy carpet squares didn鈥檛 fit correctly against the walls, and felt sticky underfoot. The shower was not clean and the water was lukewarm to cool. The toilet basin was not properly attached, and slammed into the wall every time you flushed. The air conditioning didn鈥檛 work very well at all (kept our room at about 80 degrees when on High), and blew hot air directly at the head of the bed. Additionally, the AC controls were on the ceiling, so you had to pull up a chair to adjust them (not that it did you any good). The bed linens were nice, and the mattress was fairly comfortable. BUT, rather than paying for a duvet cover for the comforter, they simply wrapped it up in two sheets. The sheets, of course, didn鈥檛 stay on the comforter well at all during the night. The end result was that you were sleeping with 3 bunched sheets and one dirty comforter 鈥?not at all pleasant.The Clarendon Hotel is, quite obviously, a gay hotel. Not a gay-friendly hotel, which we would have welcomed. Instead, we were made to feel very uncomfortable as the only heterosexual couple in the hotel. It didn't help that I am 5 months pregnant, and had to endure God, I HATE breeders! and like comments in the elevator and lobby. The clientele was obviously on the prowl for a one-night stand.The neighborhood is sketchy. There are two doors from the parking area that ought to be locked at all times, but were always open and unlocked during our 5 day stay here, leaving the hotel totally unsecure. When we checked out at 4:00 am, there were 5 different men wandering the halls. One of them even followed us out to our car. Were they guests? People off the street? Who knows? It was very, very creepy.When we got to the front desk to check out, no one was there. We ended up waiting more than 25 minutes for the front desk attendant to arrive, which made us late to the airport. So much for customer service.Do yourself a favor, stay somewhere else. This hotel ruined my romantic vacation.

<Content>Some really good, some really bad Okay, so first, the good. The staff is really friendly and nice. The rooms are large and the decor is really cute with a huge super comfy bed, a giant full length mirror and a big screen tv.Also, you should definitely eat at their restaurant. I had the unusual sounding chorizo mac and it was great!So, then the bad. First of all, there is only wi-fi in some of the rooms and they won't tell you if your room doesn't have it when you check in.The bathroom is tiny and all white and looks like a motel 6 bathroom. They put no thought into it. There's a nice sink/mirror area, but there is absolutely no lighting. Even after I moved an extra lamp over there, I had to keep going outside as I was doing my makeup because I couldn't see what I was doing and kept getting streaks all over myself.So the first night I got there, I thought I'd check out the rooftop bar that was supposed to be so great. Well it would have been great if the staff had told me there was some kind of lesbian party going on up there! Some big woman came up to me and pulled my hair REALLY hard!None of them were hotel guests, they were all just a big group that was together so they figured I was one of them and it was okay to assault me?!? So then all I wanted to do was get away from all the people and hang in my room for the night when I discovered they put me in a no wi-fi room and I would have to hang in the lobby to use it.I guess it would have been a better hotel if I were a guy, since men care more about tvs than makeup lighting and would probably be thrilled to have some strange scary woman pull their hair.

<Content>You can't not like the Clarendon - Seriously! The C is a great place to stay in Phoenix. My wife and I really enjoy the atmoshpere. It is conveiniently located in such a way that short cab rides will get you anywhere you want to go. We've never been to the C when every single person we meet, both staff and customers aren't happy and pleasant.The pool is great, the hot tub is better, the roof top bar is a gem and the bar and restaurant inside are fantastic.Our room is always clean. Sheets, pillows, towels are white and bright.We are innkeepers ourselves and understand the huge amount of work it takes to maintain this level of customer service, cleanliness and accommodation.Good Job Ben!

<Content>Worst Hotel We booked our stay for one night at the Clarendon because we wanted to be by the airport. It was advertised that the hotel was minutes away from the airport. Well it was not very close at all we were about 10 miles away and in traffic it took us about a hour to go that distance. When reading it was near the airport I would think it was just a couple of miles. While checking in we had a guy in front of us asking where a gay bar was. The clerk was happy to assest and tell him about a bar and started giving details about the activities that went on in the bar. His discription was very inappropriate and unprofesional. Once we were done with that experience we noticed the pillows were down pillows. My wife is allergic and called the front desk to ask for new pillows and was laughed at. The clerk hung up with out saying if they would replace the pillows. My wife made a second call and than was told they would have to check on alternative pillows and they would call her back. When called back they could only come up with two pillows. One pillow looked like it was laying in the gutter and the other was over stuffed. The air conditioner in the room did not work with the thermostat at all. The room was like a oven and smelled horrible from the disinfectant. Thank God for a portable fan in the room. In the morning we were afraid to eat breakfast at this place because of the terrible service we were given.

<Content>Mid Century Modern Desert Oasis The Clarendon hotel perfectly embodies the desert modern aesthetic that I miss so much about Arizona and (parts of) California. I lived in Arizona for seven years before moving to New York City and then Boston. I still come to Arizona for business and when I do I stay at the Clarendon. I wish we had something like this on the east coast. The decor is modern and in perfect harmony with the surroundings; it all just feels right. The rooms are well-appointed and comfortable and it's the nice touches like the big flat-screen televisions, the comfortable beds, the very creative and artistic curtains and the quirky selection of snacks in the rooms that make this place really stand out.In addition, I think this has to be the best value in Phoenix. Not only is it fun and unique but the prices are extremely competitive and they're centrally located; close to everything! On top of this, the pool and water wall and lighting are simply amazing. It sets a tone that cannot be beat. I haven't been to the hotel since the opening of the roof top bar area, but the bar and restaurant at the lobby level are also very awesome. This is the type of place where you want people to meet you because it is simply beautiful and your friends will think you have great taste. Admittedly this hotel may not be for everyone, but if you are a fan of Dwell or DWR this is the place to be in Arizona.

<Content>Super! I'm currently staying at this hotel and it certainly was a great find!! Both the exterior and interior are very fun and clean. The pool area looks adorableee!! The rooms are very spacious, I have a big bed with incredibly comfy pillows, a huge flat screen, mini bar, a long desk and bathroom. They really paid a lot of attention to detail, adding little accents here and there that make this place special (including the super relaxing ambient music they have playing in the room when you come in - nice detail!).I just got back from two supposedly 4 star hotels that didn't even have showercaps, it's refreshing getting to the Claredon and seeing a message that says everything is complementary (toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving kit, sewing kit... even international phone calls).I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Quirky but in a Groovy way This hotel is an older property that was refurbished in 2000. It is downtown Phoenix where there are no other eating establishments within walking distance. The hotel has a very good, moderately priced restaraunt on site which is open at 6 am for breakfast and stays open for late dinner thru 10pm. The buildings themselves are situated in a big square shape and in the center is an amazing pool and jacuzzi. The pool is well stocked with all kinds of water toys including water guns that all the teens seemed to enjoy. Music is piped into the area and there is even an underwater speaker in the pool! The nice thing about the pool being in the center of the property is that the sun goes behind the buildings in the late afternoon and one does not have to worry about sunscreen...I checked in for a medical conference arriving the evening before it started. Check in was smooth--luck of the draw, I had been upgraded to a two room suite. The rooms are enormous! Lots of funky furniture, a well stocked minibar, and crazy window coverings. The room itself was clean and the bathroom amenities nice. There are two robes hanging for use during your stay. Pool towels are available at the front desk. There is a HUGE flat screen television set in the bedroom. About the only complaint I have is the breakfast service in the dining room. There was one young, extremely overwhelmed gal who was trying to accomplish more that what one person was able to manage. Service was slow. Lunch and dinner weren't a problem. I would recommend Orbitz as a booking site since they had a price that was 1/2 the properties web site.

<Content>Worst hotel experience ever My wife and I arrived on a Thursday for a 4 night stay over Labor Day weekend. Having never stayed here before, we chose The Clarendon for its pool, not to mention a great vacation package sale on Expedia. The hotel's website proclaims itself to be a luxury boutique hotel. Didn't take long to realize this couldn't be further from the truth. Why you ask? The location leaves much to be desired. The elevator is a microwave oven that barely does its job. You can't escape the ever present foul stench that permeates the entire hotel. Our third floor room had an inadequate air conditioner loud enough to wake the dead. How about maid service not cleaning your room until around 5:00 pm? The rooftop bar is a bare bones ramshackle mess. The rooftop pool does not even exist. After using the shower the first night, it took several minutes to turn the water off. This happened again Friday morning, but we couldn't turn it off. A front desk girl was sent up who with the aid of some tools managed to turn off the water. Maintenance repaired it later in the day. We were willing to be forgiving for all of these issues, though the next day things took a dramatic turn for the worse.Our first two days consisted of mostly sightseeing and a baseball game. Minimal time was spent at hotel. Saturday afternoon we decided to return for the hotel and finally use their heavily advertised ground floor pool. Much to our surprise, the parking lot was filled to capacity and we were unable to park anywhere near the hotel. Turns out The Clarendon was hosting a party for the gay community with several hundred people most of whom were obnoxiously drunk hanging out all over the pool, lobby, hallways, entrance, etc while extremely loud techno music boomed endlessly. Admission to the pool was $20.00 for this three ring circus. We inquired how long this party was going on and were told it was from noon to midnight from Friday to Monday. Factor in that was sponsored by Coors Light and Red Bull and you best believe it would be running even later.The front desk never told us about this at check in. When finally told in the midst of this free for all, the front desk staff extended no apologies. We are not easily offended since we live in the San Francisco Bay Area and have even been in The Castro district at Halloween. The rude staff at The Clarendon were highly offensive to us as and the discriminatory treatment we received are nothing short of inexcusable. We were not made welcome here and checked out after two nights. We found another hotel for the remaining two nights. While going through the lobby, we were made fun of by the partygoers and the hotel staff. We overheard a front desk employee say that we were informed of the festivities during check in. This is a complete lie as we never would have stayed here had we known. In short, this was our worst hotel experience ever.

<Content>Great decor! I love boutique hotels, but usually don't want to pay high prices and instead stay at a plain old chain. But the rates at the Clarendon were very reasonable and the decor was fantastic! It's modern and sleek and colorful, I just wished my own house was decorated like this. Also had a great martini menu in the bar. I had vegetable enchiladas in the restaurant, and you could actually tell what all the vegetables were, and they were delicious! Not like some Mexican restaurants were everything is smashed together and not very fresh. The beds and linens were amazing, much better than a high end resort I stayed in a few weeks later. Again, how do I get my own house to be this great? I was in Phoenix for just one night for business, so I only got to view the beautiful pool but not experience it. Loved that people were up swimming early the next morning, and wished I'd thought to set my alarm earlier! I also liked the feel of being near downtown Phoenix but still having parking and not being in the middle of all the traffic. The neighborhood is super cute, lots of older homes being updated, just like this hotel. If you like fabulous beds, great service, and bright, modern decor, you will love this place. It made my business trip much more interesting than when I stay at plain chains that are nice, but nothing exciting to look at or talk about when I get home.

<Content>You get what you pay for. This was the second visit for my wife and me. We stayed at The Clarendon a year ago. Since the price was reasonable, we thought that we'd give it another try. As other guests have mentioned, the staff is very friendly and courteous (although in our experience not always effective.) The colorful decor is interesting. There have been some cosmetic changes, but the condition and maintenance is poor. When we arrived after midnight, very tired from a long journey, we moved into our room only to find that when we turned on the faucet in the bathroom sink the drainpipe burst and water flooded the bathroom. We had to pack up our belongings and move down the hall to a new room. In the morning we discovered that the privacy shade on the window facing the hallway was missing. We had to put a towel over the window, so we could let in a little light, or else it was as dark as a bat cave. We were promised that maintenance would fix it, but that didn't happen during a 4-day stay, even after repeated (5) requests. At the end of our stay we were told that the maintenance man was on vacation. Other issues: hotel security is somewhat lax with the side door to the parking lot unlocked at all times even though keyed entry is available; no locks/closer on bathroom stalls in women's room near lobby/restaurant; bathroom door lock was on the outside not inside of the door; broken glass on pool patio from the aggregate which our son stepped on and cut his foot; no security chain on room door; voice messages on telephone contained 9 old messages for previous guests with personal information stored. Upon check out we asked if we could have a fee adjustment for the inconveniences. We were told that it wasn't possible since we had booked through a third party (Expedia). With so many hotels in Phoenix to choose from, even though the location is great, we won't stay at The Clarendon again.

<Content>Loved it! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Clarendon on a recent visit to Phoenix and loved it! I booked the room with a very friendly desk clerk and he even upgraded us to a junior suite. We checked in quickly and went up to our room. Everything looks super modern and hip, from the rooms, to the hallways and dining area. The room was very clean and spacious. After settling in we decided to head down and get a cocktail in the bar. The bartender was so friendly, mixed a mean margarita, and chatted with us for a while. We took our margs out to the pool (which is incredible!) and soaked up some sun before grabbing a couple of appetizers and heading back up to our room. We were in Phoenix for a concert, so unfortunately didn't get to visit the Cafe for dinner or the rooftop bar.I work in the hospitality industry and just want to compliment the Clarendon on a job well done. We loved every aspect of our stay, had a great time chatting with the friendly staff, and would go back for another stay in a heartbeat.

<Content>Not great but very friendly On our way back from our Route 66 Road Trip from Texas to California we decided to stop by in Phoenix and take in a D-backs game. I want to first start off by saying (with the utmost respect) that Phoenix is friggin hot. When we got there it was around 110 degrees and my breath was taken away when i stepped out of the vehicle. The outside of the Clarendon is not a great sight but once I got on the inside I was really impressed with the whole ikea looking style. The pool area looked inviting and the rooms were decorated very nicely. The problem occurred when we went to our room, the AC did not work very well at all. The staff downstairs was very helpful and they told us they would give us a new room. The new room wasn't any better but once again the staff was very helpful and allowed us to switch rooms again. They also said that we would be comped for anything we wanted to eat out of the snacks/drinks in the rooms. Once again the third room was still hot and the air didn't work again. I think we were a bit more agitated during the whole incident because we were hot and the baseball game started in about an hour. We finally decided we would just leave and look for another hotel nearby. The staff was still courteous and refunded our money right away. Even though the we didn't stay I would still say that the staff at the Clarendon is very friendly and will help you in anyway they can. Also another downside was the construction and the non-working elevator. I found it hilarious though that in our last room we tried there was a huge painting of the scene from National Lampoons Vacation where Chevy Chase is standing ontop of their car in the middle of the desert. That basically summed up our whole evening in Phoenix.

<Content>Don't Even Make Your Worst Enemy Stay Here I booked this hotel through Travelocity and got double charged. Once from Travelocity on my business credit card and then again on my personal credit card. Neither company is easy to work with to get a refund for the double charged amount. The hotel was cool but dirty, in a low-income neighborhood, and nothing worked properly. All the air-conditioners in the rooms were broke (which is what the front desk staff said when I called to tell them my AC was not working properly) resulting in me turning my AC to 55 degrees just to get it to turn on, then running louder than a train wreck all night to spit out a measly amount of cool air on a 100+ degree night. When checking in they gave my reservation away which was a double bed room, and made me stay in a single bed room, with my co-worker - which as a married woman was an extremely awkward situation. And when I bring it up to them today after I called about the double booking charge they first told me that both the King rooms and Double rooms are standard so Travelocity can't tell the difference when making a reservation, and that they did my a favor by upgrading me to a king room. Obviously that's a contradiction (first a king bed and double room are standard, then the king room is an upgrade?), and I still have my Travelocity email confirmation which clearly stated a double room with 2 beds was reserved. + I remember clearly being able to choose which room type I wanted online. I wouldn't recommend staying at this hotel or having to go through this experience to my worst enemy.

<Content>Great for fun travel, a little less great for business travel I stayed at the Clarendon during a business trip that included a little free time. The staff was super-friendly and helpful. The rooms are beautiful, the bed comfy, the bedsheets and pillows heavenly! Great TV, excellent pool. There was lovely local art in the restaurant and lobby. A few small negatives - the pool is open until midnight and so my second floor poolside room was a little noisy a bit later than I was expecting. I asked to be moved to a quieter room the next night and all was well until I discovered that the free in-room wireless Internet wasn't working there. Seems it works better in some of the rooms than others, but was always available in the lobby (where there's a computer and a printer for general use). The restaurant food was good but service was a little slower than I had hoped as a business traveler. One day there was an issue with the air conditioner and the rooms were warm overnight - luckily they had it fixed the next day. Business travel amenities were absent (no daily papers, no bill under your door on the last day, no notice of the checkout time in the room, no breakfast buffet). I would definitely stay at the Clarendon again for personal travel (rate was $84!) but for business I might go elsewhere.

<Content>Try something different - go Clarendon We just got back from Phoenix yesterday. We were there for a long weekend. We stayed at the Calrendon for 4 nights. When we checked in we were upgraded to a suite which was awesome. We didn't request an upgrade the hotel just gave it to us. Check in was easy and fast - front desk staff is very accomodating and friendly. The building is old but the decor and atmopshere is great. Everything is very clean.

<Content>Great Hotel for the Price I stayed at the Clarendon recently for a business trip and took the advice of other Tripadvisors reviews. I was a little hesitant because the reviews were a mixed bag. Fortunately I would have to say I was one who throughly enjoyed this hotel and definetly would come back.To start off, the hotel is a little off center. It is in the middle of a neighborhood and not really close to much. The main entrance doors were broken, and when I entered the other doors, a man was photographing a young women for I don't know what. Moving past that, the people who worked there were extremely nice and helpful. They upgraded my room to a Junior Suite. Score. The room was huge, and the bed was a very comfortable king size bed. The bathroom was fine with boutique beauty products and nice decor, but the bathtub was a little dirty. The room and the hotel are definetly colorful with lots of artwork, but I thought it looked really nice and modern. The room was clean and it came with a 42 flat screen TV with HD, cable, and DVR!!! The wireless internet was really fast when I first got there, which is rare for me, but at night did not really work at all.The hotel is provided with an amazing looking pool in the central courtyard. I unfortunately didn't use it, but If I had more time, I definetly would of. The bar looked nice, and the upstairs bar was closed at the time of the visit (a little disappointing, but it was Tuesday). I ate Breakfast at the restaurant the next morning, and it was good, but a little pricey. Overall this was a great hotel and I would definetly recommend this to anyone coming to Phoenix. It was especially good for the deal (less then $100).

<Content>Springtime in Phoenix Springtime in PhoenixMarch 2008 The Clarendon Hotel Grade B+ Pros: Fairly inexpensive, large bed and TV.Cons: Odd area. FULL REVIEW:My girlfriend and I decided to get away from not so 鈥渟pring like鈥?conditions from northern Colorado and spend spring break in Phoenix, Arizona. It was mid march and the weather was fantastic, around 75 degrees during the day and 57 at night. THE HOTEL: The hotel is 15 stories tall with a rooftop lounge that allows the occupant to watch the glow of the Arizona sunset. Two elevators carry passengers from the lobby to the top floor and back. The room was easy to find and access as ours was on the third floor room 鈥?12鈥? The elevators require a keycard for access to the rooms for personal security.OUR ROOM: This was the best part! The room included a huge California King sized bed, a 50 inch big screen HD television, along with a nice sized bathroom and Jacuzzi/bathtub. Also included was a complimentary refrigerator and a mini bar. LOCATION: The only thing that put a ding in this hotels services is its location. The closest restaurant is nearly 4 miles away. This hotel is located at 4134 W. Clarendon St. Phoenix, Arizona, 83510. In the middle of the business district is where you will find this hotel, about 13 miles SW of the airport. AMMENITIES: - Pool and hot tub- Restaurant and bar- Rooftop lounge and bar ( open mar-sep 5-9 pm)- Room service- Cable TV- Free Internet- Clean sheets, vacuum and tidy room by 11:00 AM - Fitness Center- Conference rooms COST AND VALUE : The room was $121 per night, and to me, just having the big bed and TV was enough to convince me to pay that or more per night. The overall quality was good, and the free continental breakfasts weren鈥檛 too bad either. Overall the stay was highly enjoyable, and the cost for what the rooms provided was a nice change. The amenities in the room worked perfectly like the toilet and sinks and the room was always cleaned immaculately every time we left. Recommended: YES

<Content>A unique, hidden hip hotel... I found this unique hotel listed on Expedia and after checking out their website decided to stay there. Could not beat the price! Enjoyed my short stay there. Staff was great and so not stuffy. Very laid back, but in a good way. It's a little oasis - pool area great. Definitely a young crowd. Rooms were funky and then there's the flat screen tv. The softest bed!!!! No charge for parking, always a plus. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Awsome "boutique" hotel I booked this hotel while in AZ on business. I got a GREAT price on Hotels.com (almost 1/2 price on a 24 hr sale).I have to admit that when I first pulled up outside my responce to my GPS saying you have reached your destination was...LIKE HELL I HAVE! But, then i went into the lobby and any concerns I had were washed away....It was awsome. (but get someone in to finish the marble installation on the Front Desk...It really does look unfinished)Amenities were great, Room 228 was CLEAN, mini fridge was froze over butno issue with that, Great huge flat screen TV's, pool beautiful staff was friendly (even the one house keeper who could only say I no speak english.  My only negative....I do not mind that you have all of your rooms nonsmoking, I even understand it. BUT, Allow people to smoke on the balcony or near the pool. It really isnt fair to make someone go down 2 flights of stairs, out the front door nd across the street to smoke.Had you description said this was a NONSMOKING PROPERTY i probably would not have choosen it. But I am glad I experienced it once.

<Content>Simply cool and very good alternative to expensive chain hotels I stayed at the Clarendon for 6 nights. I had first considered the Hyatt downtown downtown (that's not a mistake, that's what it's called). Why the Hyatt? Because the conference I had to attend took place there. I'm glad I stayed at the Clarendon!It all depends on what you want I guess. If you want to know in advance what to expect, go for Hyatt, Hilton, etc. If you want to foster local American economy and help a guy who started from scratch - Go Clarendon! This is not 4 star standard I must (unfortunately) agree. But if you are not ready to hop in your grave yet (i.e. you don't feel old), can dig a certain level of noise from the aircon and c) dig that sometimes things break (like the elevator and the On Demand Movies when I was there) this is a cool place to stay. Were these breakdowns bad? I don't think so. Using the stairs is healthier anyway and you can buy movies on DVD. What disturbed me a bit at first was that the Wi-Fi didn't work in my room - or was it my laptop? Well, it worked with my laptop in the bar and outside and I really enjoyed sitting there typing mails and sipping on a beer or a cocktail (both were excellent).What really distinguishes the Clarendon is its staff. That's if you like cool people and don't expect stiffness and butler like behavior. Stacy, who took care of my breakfast, is a class of her own. Her life loving attidude makes it easy to start your day.On three evenings I enjoyed their South-Western kitchen (no it is not Japanese anymore, but the cook can probably do anything for you). I liked the food, and I'm from Europe,i.e. I don't eat fat stuff like burgers. I also liked the comfortable bed and the cleanliness of my room. The pool is as good (and better) as the other reviews suggest. Having seen the pool of the Clarendon and then that of the hotel I named above I'm glad (again) that I went Clarendon. I don't do work out too much, but the facilities seemed alright to me.Some people were concerned about safety (the Clarendon is downtown). Well, the area where the Clarendon lies seems safe to me. You can always be unlucky, especially in the US. Get rid of them guns and your social wellfare sorted out right and don't blame it on the hotel you are staying at if someone breaks in your car.The Clarendon is an ideal alternative to downtown downtown big chain hotel prices and deserves that you treat it fairly: If you pay below 160 bucks you should not expect the level of exclusiveness of the Ritz. What you can expect at the Clarendon is that people care and try (within their limits and resources) to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.I would come again (and hope that they modernise the aircon)

<Content>Better than last time, but sorry still don't think this hotel is worth the full We were in Phoenix again in March and needed somewhere to stay. We got a great deal on Expedia for the Clarendon and decided that as the pool was ready we'd give it another go. Pool is undoubtedly fantastic, although bits of the glass from the chippings around the pool had worked loose and were really painful on your feet- a small thing which could easily be resolved. The rooftop bar was great and the staff very friendly, but there are some small details which have just been overlooked- eg the toilets near the restaurant are old, the shower and baths in the bathrooms are old, breakfast is ok, but we weren't told we had to pay extra for the orange juice we ordered etc. All in all, the place is definitley improving , but still needs some work. Would we stay again? Definitley if the price was right, but no way would I pay anywhere near the full price

<Content>Mixed Bag - Some Things Great / Some Things Not So Much That they took a nondescript, boxy '50s motel and turned it into a desirable place deserves credit at the get-go. It's kind of like W meets Hard Rock -- in the desert. (The hallways are painted purple!) But it's quirky, and the service levels are spotty. I'm guessing that the owners are young. Apparently a number of the rooms have both the air conditioning and, only coincidentally, the hot water reversed. That means you turn your thermostat to hot to get cool air; and you turn the shower control to cold to get hot water. They've had cable problems (for quite some time, apparently) so there's no movie channels, and there's no pay-per-view. Mostly, take note that there's a gay-hipster-young scene at the pool most every night, whether it's happy hour or a private party. It's interesting - for about 15 minutes. The staff seem to be oblivious to the noise in the parking lot, the noise from the restaurant, and the noise at the pool. I'm here on a special rate, so it's hard to complain, but if I'd paid $160+ for this room, I'd be annoyed. This is not a good hotel for families. It is a GREAT hotel for young scenesters who want to stay up late and drink and carry-on. I'd stay here again, I'd just make sure I asked for a quiet corner of the hotel. This place is obviously very desireable to a certain demographic, and I continue to be thankful they've fixed up what was probably only an eyesore -- they get big points for urban renewal!

<Content>Marketing genius! We booked this hotel based on trip advisor reviews and the hotel website. The owner is a marketing genius! We would admit that the pool and hot tub were very nice, but that is the only thing that makes these outdated motel style rooms bearable. The hotel has tried to put in cool artwork, flat screens and modern furniture, but it really does not make up for the outdated exterior, cinderblock walls, open air rooms which must be very hot in the summer and the need for some serious new carpets. We had a suite and our bathroom was literally too small to turn around in, the cooling system was very loud. We visited the roof top bar which was advertised as the new hip place in Phoenix, there was literally no one there at 10:00 on a Friday night. The hotel is not near anything of interest, and it is about a 20 minute drive to the airport. I have to say that the staff was very nice and helpful, but the most impressive thing about this hotel is how the owner has found a way to market such an outdated property! We live in a city and are used to city life, but my son thought the best way to describe this boutique hotel was sketchy.

<Content>Fabulous hotel! This was my first time staying at the Claredon and I was very impressed! I am a Phoenix local, and stayed with a group of girls (we are all 24-26 in age) for an event. The room was spacious and clean and had great decor. The pool area was awesome-it looked very hip with big sun beds and a giant hot tub-really could fit 20 people easily! We had the same server at the pool and the restaurant and she was beyond excellent! All the staff were very friendly and we had a great time. I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Not as good as advertised I selected this hotel after reading glowing reports on this and other sites. I can't say it was worht the $200+ room multiple sites requested. We stayed for a under $150, including vouchers for breakfast. This price is about what it should be. Clarendon isn't quite downtown. It is not within walking distance to attractions, shopping, restaurants. If you won't have a car, you may want to stay elsewhere. The hotel boasts a free driver service, but I didn't look into it. The room we had (king suite) was large, with limited furniture. The floor coverings were noticeably dirty and needed cleaned. Large plasma TV. Bathroom was nice size, but the tub needed resurfaced or replaced. Paint was very scratched, with some weird blue tint. They did not have extra toiletries such as toothpaste or shaving creme when we stayed. They have a nice pool area, including a hot tub the same width as the pool. Very comfy furniture in the pool area. Roof top bar isn't impressive. Breakfast buffett isn't that great. I wouldn't recommend paying extra for it. FYI -- juice isn't included.  If you need to stay in the downtown Phoenix area, you may want to consider Clarendon. It is a nice break from chains. Location is not wonderful for tourists. If you are visiting Phoenix area, you may want to stay in Scottsdale or another area where there is more to do in the immediate vacinity.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed at the Clarendon in January 2008. It was great from beginning to end. We arrived late and the staff was awesome, they were extremely helpful and had excellent late night dining recommendations. The room was very comfy and super clean, and the bed was great, i slept very well. The towels were great and the l'occitane soaps and lotions were a very nice touch, tiny sizes, but very nice. The pool area is great and we loved the jacuzzi and the fact that you can go there at 3am if you want to. we enjoyed the restaurant as well. Parking is free (a plus) and they are pet friendly, our dog loved it as well. My only complaint is that the coffee was not very good, but other than that who cares, i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone and everyone. The art is fresh and original and i cant wait to return to try the rooftop bar, it was too cold for me to go last time. (it was january, after all).. It is my go- to hotel in phoenix. :)

<Content>I will be back Over in Phoenix for a quick business trip, I will admit I was at first put off by the front entrance and the fact that the hotel seemed a bit far off from attractions, shopping centers and restaurants. But quickly and in many ways The Clarendon Hotel made up for the secluded location... rooms are vast and clean, the pool is gorgeous, atmosphere was casual, service was impeccable, convenient free wifi access, free excellent breakfast. No hidden fees, a great price/value deal. There was a hard to define cool quality to the Clarendon... It just felt very good staying over and the business trip thanks to the Clarendon felt like a 3-day holiday. I had never posted a review on trip advisor but felt this hotel deserved I spend 5 minutes of my busy life doing so.

<Content>Good value but not 3.5 stars I had to be in Phoenix for one night and booked a deal on Hotwire. It was a good value for what I was charged but this is not, in my opinion, a 3.5 star hotel. The good. The beds are comfortable with high quality linen and nice down pillows. The room was clean and the bathrooms were well stocked with nice plush towels. Nice large screen TV in room. The room had a small refridgerator and was also stocked with some snacks. I did not use any of these so do not know what the hotel charges for them. The breakfast buffett was limited in offerings but was well done. Eggs, ham, sausage, and potatos were all good and the service was attentative.The bad - this place is LOUD. It is a refurbishished building probably dating from the 50's or 60's and the construction is cement block. Cement block construction alone would make it loud but the the rooms are also built around a courtyard containing the swimming pool. That combined with the the rooftop bar made this a noisy room. If you do stay here make sure you have ear plugs. I picked some up when I went out to dinner and got a good nights sleep on a comfortable bed. Good value at the Hotwire deal price but I would have been upset if I had payed full rack rate.

<Content>Amazining Roof Top Sunsets What a wonderful time to be in Phoenix! During my trip this February in part for work but also for fun, I had an opportunity to stay at the Clarendon again. I don't know how they do it but they have certainly improved on their already spectacular service and ammenities.Two of the Must Do's during your stay at the Clarendon. The awesome roof top sunset exeperience is one. I got a chance to enjoy a beer while watching the sun set from this amazing roof top vantage point. The roof has been recently remodled to give the guest a incredible panoramic view of uptown and downtown Phoenix not to mention the incredible South, Estrella and White Tank Mountains. The roof top seating provided for guests and vistors of the Clarendon certainly hold true the Hotel's creative and unique high end decore.The second must do while at the Clarendon, have a meal at their new restuarant, C4. This restuarant has certianly molded in to the hot spot for the hotel guests and locals. C4 is working with their local vendors and focusing on gearing their menu to reflect the produce and animals raised in the Phoenix Metro and surrounding areas.What again ties all of this together is the attentive employees at the Clarendon. This group certainly knows how to make guests feel how much they value you; from the nice lady who cleans your room and says, Good Morning, to the person who brings you room service in the evening.Thanks again Clarendon Hotel  Suites...Nick AlmendarezRegional HR ManagerLos Angeles, California

<Content>Young and Hip I was really curious about how I'd like this hotel after reading the variety of reviews here. I almost cancelled but decided to give it a shot and try it for myself, which I am glad I did. I am the kind of person who's willing to have an open mind!The Clarendon is a cool place - and I also fully agree with aem49 that its not for everyone. The staff is young - but good, and the whole place has a fun attitude, from the background music to the Employee of the Month photo wall ( you have to see it). The pool area is great and the rooftop happy hour (with DJ) was a lot of fun (at this time of year, anyway). Rooms were large and the bed was very nice,  it had a sort of living room that made me think it would be a great place for a few people to get together and party. My only criticism is that for the price I paid ($219) I would expect a little more attention to detail in the remodeling than they did. You can tell its an older place that's been restyled, but they didn't 100% hit the mark with the quality of certain small things. Nevertheless we had a great time, the free breakfast was good, and I would def. recommend it to the younger crowd. I'd stay there again if I could get a better price next time.

<Content>Loved my stay but wouldn't recommend for everyone I stayed 3 nights at the Clarendon in February while I was on a campus visit to the ASU downtown campus. As a young, single traveler I couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The rooftop Happy Hour seems to be quickly becoming a local hotspot so it's a great place to meet some new and interesting people. The rooms are nicely decorated with bright colors and unique artwork, and mine was extremely large. The bathrooms aren't large but they have been recently redone. They did a great job rennovating the pool and hot tub area. The waterwall is a very cool edition. The restaurant and bar are ok, but the Asian fusion menu posted on their website has been replaced with a more generic bar menu. I didn't notice any issues with the location and felt perfectly safe in the area, but I do live in a major city. I don't think I would recommend the hotel for a family or someone looking for a relaxing vacation, but if you're looking for a fun city environment much like what you would find in South Beach and NYC the Clarendon is by far the best hotel in Phoenix.

<Content>Super Bowl Weekend We stayed at the Clarendon for Super Bowl weekend and found the staff friendly and attentive. The restaurant staff went above and beyond serving meals to all the fans when we returned from the game. The breakfast was terrific and their menu was eclectic. The decor of the hotel is modern and fun. We generally stay at hotel chains, and the Clarendon was a nice change of pace for us.

<Content>Start with the positive then go on with the rest read below beware first off, the hotel is old but looks nice and unique, the restaurant is nice, the beds are super comfortable. Now for the rest. They don't tell you that there is no air conditioning in the off season it was like a sauna. There was NO HOT WATER, NO TOWELS and when asked for it we were YELLED at by the rude staff. When I say rude I mean bipolar mean and scary. They are nice until they get your money but leave out a lot information until they do get your money. They are defensive and obviously used to many problems. Good news is we disputed the charge on our credit card and won, they didn't really fight because it was so awful. You are attracted to this property because of the price. You can do better at a Wingate or mid-end hotel, like I said at first, the best thing is the comfy beds and the restaurant - otherwise you are throwing away your money and asking for a lot of abuse.

<Content>The Clarendon is Tops It is always a pleasure to stay at Clarendon hotel, I am a local so from time to time for a little getaway I take off to this hip hotel. I absolutely love the new pool and restaurant so I don't have to go out for my meals when all I want to do is relax. The staff is always helpful and extremely friendly...big plus for me! I look forward to my getaways at Clarendon.

<Content>Great Hotel with a Fantastic Restaurant This quaint boutique hotel nestled near downtown Phoenix gives any traveler a break from large chain hotels. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable about the area and attentive to your needs and questions. The rooms are great. I had a room with a large bedroom, Each room has a 50 flat screen TV as well as a separate sitting area. Even the phone service is great with free local and national calling. The parents of the owner were around greeting guests in the restaurant. For breakfast, as a guest of the hotel, each party received a $10 credit. Most items in the menu are around $8 (FREE breakfast) WONDERFUL menu.

<Content>Third time unlucky! Visited the Clarendon on 2 separate dates in May 2007 and for a free week by way of compensation over Christmas 2007.17 May Given Room 110. Restaurant closed. Painting didn鈥檛 cover the window space and as first floor we had to improvise with hanger and long garment for privacy from car park outside. Sink didn鈥檛 hold water and toiletries from previous guests were down the back as there is a gap. Toilet not fixed to the floor and cistern barely fixed to the wc and seat loose. Toilet paper holder also loose and roll kept sliding off onto the floor. Main door to suite had no door stop and hole in wall from impact. No plastic or glass drinking glasses just 鈥榩erfect touch鈥?coffee ones. Plastic glass brought with us for husband to take medication was thrown out by the housekeeper. Coffee, shampoo and tissues not replenished second day ($2 left for housekeeper). I had to ask at reception whether the items left in the fridge/room were complimentary as no list of charges left in the room. When we pointed out our concerns regarding the room to the girl on duty she was surprised to see the room as she hadn't realised there were still rooms being used which hadn't been upgraded i.e. granite tops to avoid water damage from ice bucket condensation etc. She also stated that the room rates had been reduced since our direct booking with the hotel and this should have been spotted at the time of check-in. Our bill was reduced by 50% and we were assured that on our return for the night of the 26th we would also have 50% reduction but would be upgraded to a nicer room. 26 MayWe were charged $267.85 for the 2-night stay.We returned with high expectations of our upgraded room. It was 99 degrees in Phoenix and on checking in were told that there was a leak in the hotel's air- conditioning system but that plumbers were coming to fix it and should have it up and running within half an hour. We were first given keys to a room on the second floor but by the time we'd brought in our baggage the 2 staff at reception hadchanged it to 308 as they thought it had a better view. We clambered up in the very hot elevator to the third floor and took our bags into the room. On entering the bathroom we were horrified to see the stains on the floor. Apart from the stains on the floor the strip light over the sink did not work, there was no top to the pop-up waste in the sink so sink could not hold water, the lights and TV in the sitting area were oddlyplugged in so that no lights could be turned on or off from the wall switches but the wall switch by the bedroom door turned on the TV! Although there was a second TV in the sitting area there was no remote control for it. We had the light over the sink replaced after speaking to reception but it was some time later in the day that another fan was brought up as AC still not working. As there is only one ice machine it is quite a hike to go down from the 3rd floor to get ice. The elevator makes a rather unnerving judder on the 3rd floor and so stairs were used when not carrying baggage. We went out to dinner and when we returned the AC was still out but we managed to get to sleep. We awoke at 2.40am and it was cool so turned off the fans. Wewere told at breakfast that the AC had been fixed at midnight. I didn't want to post a long list of gripes onto tripadvisor as the place as a whole is great and the staff are very nice indeed but it is let down by small niggles (and the amount of them) which on the whole I felt could be avoided if the staff were more on the ball. It isn't much good telling us that renovations are going to be done when we havetravelled a long way for what we had hoped to be an enjoyable experience. We had also thought if our time at the Clarendon was nice that we'd return for Christmas but would need to be assured that the proposed renovations had taken place before chancing staying again.I emailed the hotel direct with my findings and on invitation from Ben Bethel, owner/GM, we were invited as guests 22-29 December to stay in a suite and enjoy the 鈥渞eplaced AC system with a state of the art system - one of the best out there鈥?. elevator cab is being completely remodeled, even with air conditioning!鈥? new restaurant, and of course his pride and joy the new pool and waterfall feature. At the time this free offer was of a value of over $2,000. We booked a 3 week-long 3 centre trip with our last night prior to flying back to UK in an Executive Room at the Clarendon. In June 2007 the price quoted on the hotel鈥檚 website was for $514 (including tax) for the night of 3 January. Nearer the time of our trip I found the price had dropped to $179 plus tax but was unable to contact the hotel by email as their mailbox was full. I therefore emailed Ben direct and he said he would look into it when he was next at the hotel in the following few days. We heard nothing further from him and so cancelled our booking and rebooked at the lower price. Arrived on 22 December at around 3pm after a 5 hour car journey from Vegas, our first port of call. Welcomed by Ben himself (although we didn鈥檛 know until later it was him) who apologised for the boarded up hole at the front of the hotel, as they were awaiting installation of a new entrance. Another member of staff organised a trolley for our luggage. We were given room 215. The elevator had been remodelled in a very strange manner with white plastic sides, steel doors which caught when opening and a windowed back showing unattractive breeze-block wall of elevator shaft! On initial inspection of our suite we saw straight away that there was no TV in the living area, a chipped luggage rack which in May had been at the base of the bed was now being used as a coffee table, only 3 hangers and no bar of soap in the bathroom. We were unable to get heat in the room. We asked about these items on our way down to the restaurant for a late lunch. Soap and extra hangers were provided. There was no 鈥渟pare鈥?TV though for the second room of the suite. We were told someone was working on the heating. There were more pictures on the walls of the rooms than in May 鈥?unfortunately not level. We had a very enjoyable lunch in the new restaurant and Ben Bethel came and spoke with us and said how pleased he was that he had a restaurant after the lengthy and expensive court battle the hotel had been through with previously independent restaurant owners. We were given vouchers worth $10 per person to cover breakfast and were told to get a voucher for each morning of our stay.After lunch we went to the room to unpack and found many of the surfaces were dusty or sticky, the sofa was covered with crumbs, there was a used lint roller under one of the units and half of the little drawer space available was filled with telephone directories. The drawer space may well be sufficient for travellers living out of a suitcase or just staying one night on a business trip but is not sufficient for a lengthy stay. All other hotels on our trip had at least one if not two large 3-drawer chest of drawers for clothes as well as bedside cabinets. I went to get ice from the ice machine which had previously been on the first floor near the pool and was told by housekeeping that it was now on the 3rd floor. It was not working however (and was out of order for the entire 7 days) and ice was fetched from the kitchen by reception staff. Returned to the restaurant for dinner and were given a table by the large windows. There was no heating in the hotel and as it was 32鈼 outside the cold air from the window made us move to the centre of the room. Another couple said they had just done the same as it was so cold. Having read on tripadvisor that a guest in November was cold when it was 43鈼 and the hotel had said it was too early to switch on the heating I had emailed the hotel to mention my concern that there would be heating, as last year it snowed at Christmas in Vegas. After complaining to reception we were given their oil-filled radiator to take up to our room. There is no dividing door between the bedroom and living area of the suite so it is a large area to heat with a small radiator. We huddled under the bedcovers and watched the TV hoping the heating would soon be fixed. (It remained off for 6 days). The hot water in the bath/shower was not very hot and we never got hot water in the sink so my husband had to shave in tepid water all week. I don鈥檛 know if the water problem was linked with the heating problem. The next morning we went to get our breakfast in the restaurant and sat down at a completely bare table (no condiments of any description). After half an hour we got some coffee but had to repeatedly ask for milk for it and after getting a small jug of milk another waitress brought me a glass of milk. When I said I hadn鈥檛 ordered a glass of milk but merely some for my coffee she responded that I wouldn鈥檛 be charged for it! I ordered a power breakfast but there was no granola and so asked for an English muffin (out of those too), a poached egg (could only have 2) so ended up having white toast with 2 small greasy slices of bacon. My husband ordered sourdough toast but got plain white. This entire process had taken an hour and we were through our initial coffees by the time the food arrived and were given a look of horror by the waitress when we asked for a refill of coffee. A couple at the next table were served cereal in take-out containers (not in a bowl) and given a glass of milk to pour over it as 鈥渢hey were out of jugs鈥? Not an experience we wished to repeat so did not use the restaurant again. I used the guest computer to check my emails and there was one from Ben offering all rooms until 30th December 2007 at $89 per night. The value of our free stay had gone down from over $2,000 to $623! I also sent an email asking whether a BB we鈥檇 used the previous May had last minute availability as despite the Clarendon being free board it was not shaping up to be the enjoyable, relaxing experience we鈥檇 envisaged. The following day I had a reply saying they were full and it was lucky I鈥檇 checked as the guest computer was out of service from then onwards. For some reason our room was never cleaned before 4pm and on Christmas Eve we were given 2 sets of clean towels so expected we were not to have housekeeping on Christmas Day. We had decided to make the best of it for Christmas and bought food on Christmas Eve from Safeway (they were closed on Christmas Day) and had planned to have a picnic on the roof. There are tables, chairs, sofas on exterior carpeting on part of the roof accessible via stairs from the 3rd floor. Unfortunately it was too windy to do so and so we dragged the small telephone table into the bedroom and using the one dining chair and bar stool seat we picnicked in front of the TV in our bedroom. Housekeeping arrived after 4pm and I gave her $5 to take out the garbage. On our last night at the hotel we arrived back at 6pm after a long hike and wanted to wash and change for dinner and the room hadn鈥檛 been cleaned so I had to go to reception for fresh towels. At 6.15pm housekeeping asked if we wanted service but by then we just wanted privacy. We found by accident a Marriott Hotel on Central Avenue and went in and asked for their rates and to see a room. For the night of 3 January when the Clarendon wanted $179 for the Executive Room we got a room including fridge, microwave, breakfast etc. for $152. We booked it and cancelled our night at the Clarendon. The Fairfield Inn Marriott is opposite 3 good restaurants and close to the Heard Museum. Having had it in writing from the Clarendon that their chauffeured care would be available we had asked to be driven to a restaurant in Central Avenue as we did not want to drink and drive and were told that it was no longer available but that they could call for a taxi. This was not notified to us prior to our arrival. The Marriott not only has this 5 mile radius free service but also collects and delivers guests to the airport. Our stay at the Clarendon did not ruin our holiday and we did sleep well and our room was quiet but I can鈥檛 say it added to its enjoyment. We used to dread returning to it each evening to find out what wasn鈥檛 working next and whether or room had been cleaned. I am sure people will be amazed that I have complained despite our stay being free but on hearing remarks from fellow guests who were also not at all happy with their experience I thought my observations would hold more gravity as a warning to others as my stay was free. I would not stay at this hotel again and would certainly not recommend it to anybody. I am amazed at how this hotel remains so high on the tripadvisor list considering the many bad reviews it has had since our first stay in May. At the very least one expects from even a Motel 6 to have a clean room, hot water, air conditioning/heating, ice, toiletries and when guaranteed the best price when booking direct to pay the best price on the day. In my opinion this hotel is run for the convenience of the staff and not the guests. On reading remarks from other December guests on tripadvisor I noticed that one remarked on the access door to the car park was not secure and Ben claimed that it was not broken. It may not have been broken but was open throughout our visit as we went in and out a couple of times per day and it was always on the latch.

<Content>A hotel with a personality disorder I visited in December 2007 and had a fairly negative experience. It was worth the discounted rate that I receive, but the price quoted here is definitely way, way above what it should be. It is a painted motel with some neat features and good style points, but not the most comfortable stay. I did enjoy the mattress and the bedroom updates.Ultimately it didn't feel like I was in a better hotel and I was disappointed with the business service. The wireless access was important but the two nearest two my room (I was in the East side apparently) were not functioning so I had to either seek out a common area or constantly refresh my connection in hopes that it would be stronger then before.Having reviewed the other reviews, and the constant feedback from managment, I will say that I did call the front desk on three occasions during my stay and each time I was assured that they were either working on it or it was hinted that I didn't understand my computer's connection. Travelling and using Wi-Fi frequently, the notion was silly.All in all this is a decent motel stay. Its prettier and has some better in room amenities, but don't compare to any upper level three or four star hotels.

<Content>I'LL Be Baackkk ! The location is a bit hard to find the first time, but once you figure out the cross streets, you realize that this is a great location. I was visiting the area museums and friends and found that it was located in a great spot. Once the rail transportation system is up and running and the road construction finished, this location will be more easily accessible. I stayed there before the pool was finished, but I am looking forward to my return and the chance to see what was constructed in the open space. As my niece said, the colors reminded her of being back in the 1960's. The bed was fabulous, the room size was very large, and yes the bathroom was small, but the bathtub and sink were clean, and it was supplied with nice fluffy towels. I too had problems with the water supply faucet and trying to regulate the water temperature. As I told the front desk, if a small child had gotten in the tub with the water running, they would have been scalded. I never did figure out the plastic temp. thingie鈥?So I am glad that they are addressing that problem. TV is great, so is the sound machine, free internet, frig, coffee machine, desk area, etc. The staff is very friendly and courteous; the maid service was friendly and tried to stay out of your way while they were working in the hall with their service cart. The hotel was still a work in progress when I was there, but it sounds like they will still continue to work on and improve the property. But even staying there during the current time period- The Claredon is still a wonderful boutique hotel, it is a unique and original hotel. When you arrive, ask for an upgraded room, and I bet you get it. They seem very much wanting to please their guests.

<Content>Great Place, Great Service! I am not sure about Yourconnection's review on Jan. 5, 2008. It is almost like we stayed in two different places. I did not see any indication that there had been a fire in one of the restaurants. All of the restaurants that were on the property were open when I went only 5 days before yourconnection went. Maybe I missed one of the restaurants, but I am sure they were all open to all of the guest. The linens and rooms were great. The customer service was great. I actually liked the fitness room and there were machines in the fitness room that you normally do not find in hotel fitness rooms. I am not sure but you can not compare a fitness chain's facility to a hotel facility fitness room. When I was in the hotel (New Year's Eve) there were a few celebrities staying at the Clarendon. I enjoyed myself and I did not feel like there were security issues, but every person has a right to their opinion. I know that the Clarendon met and exceeded my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone. You will not be disappointed. It is a bit colorful, (in a good way) but it has a style to some of the boutique hotels I have stayed at (in New York, Miami, Los Angeles) for a fraction of the price. The beds are crazy comfortable and the rooms are spacious. The hotel is centrally located to everything. Close to downtown and Scottsdale. Definitely a hotel you want to try if you are in the area. The pool area is very nice too.

<Content>Nice hotel, friendly staff The staff is very friendly here. I booked the standard room, and when I checked-in, they said they would give me the executive room. But because I was traveling with my mother and the executive room had just 1 double bed, so I got the suite with 2 single beds.The room was very nice, comfortable with a living room separate from the bedroom. It had a big plasma TV, a counter where you could use your laptop (the room had free wireless Internet access). But the bathroom and the closet were a little small for a room like that.The location is also good, just a few minutes by taxi from the Biltmore Fashion Park and within walking distance from drugstores and fast food restaurants.

<Content>Great mattress and linens, but beyond that scary and disappointing I booked through hotwire, and it was an extreme disappointment. The pictures on the travel sites resemble nothing of the reality of this hotel. First, the location is scary, and not one I would ever pay to be in. I parked my new car under the security camera and hoped it worked. But when I found the outside door lock broken to the hotel I didn鈥檛 have a lot of hope for a working security camera. The restaurant was closed by a fire a few months before, and from the looks of things it is not coming back. The hotel appears to be badly managed and in poor repair. Most of all the doors going into the guest rooms were badly damaged and needed painting. In the hall going to the fitness room they had painted the walls, but failed to cut in the ceiling and corners. When I asked the front desk when they had painted the hall they told me two months ago. The fitness room had very old equipment. It would be far better not to have a fitness room at all than have guest show up expecting one and see that one. Lastly, the room was far from clean, but on a positive note the beds, linens and bath products are great. Although I know management can not do anything about the neighborhood that surrounds it, it will take a lot of money for upgrades and repairs to bring this hotel up to rating it gives itself.

<Content>Unique hotel but not staffed for full business I took a chance and booked the hotel for two nights over the holidays. The rooms are 'hip', certainly and there has been work done to update the property. Beds were comfortable. The hot tub was nice on a chilly night. The staff was friendly. The location is great, too. The problem we encountered that could not be rectified since we had 'prepaid' for the room was the breakfast, which is included. We arrived and were seated and waited for water and coffee. We then were able to order and then waited for over an hour. Tables nearby were uncleared, obviously there was not enough staff to serve breakfast to the guests. We were not interested in even trying to wait for breakfast the second day. The menu looked real good, but it is difficult to say what is delivered.The second night we were awaken to noise in the next room (or nearby room). The insulation/soundproofing is poor or nonexistant. We did call the desk at 3am and the noise did stop shortly thereafter.The staff is responsive. They are friendly and apologized, but I guess I can't recommend this hotel since we weren't provided what was agreed and what we paid for.

<Content>Nice paint job. But little else My wife and I visited the Clarendon Hotel based on the high rating on Trip Advisor, and now are doing are part to ensure that it is properly reviewed. We are a young couple, accustomed to a variety of price points for hotels and different levels of accommodations. We opted for the Executive Junior Suite, because of its distance from the pool. We requested a fourth floor room (hoping to be as far from excessive use areas as possible). The Clarendon did manage to accomplish both of these requests. When you first pull up, you will be slightly concerned by the outdoor appearance. It looks like a retrofitted seventies motel. When you get inside, you'll notice brightly colored carpets, modern furniture and art, and loud paint tones. It looks like a hip, fun place to be. When you arrive in your room, you'll get the same experience- a lot of cosmetic work has been done. Even the pool is a cosmetic redo. It looks great with decorative fountains and great outdoor furniture. But the jacuzzi is just a wading pool with a dozen lower back jets that do little for muscles and hurt the skin. And it doesn't stand out compared to other hotels in the area. (Would recommend the Hilton Squaw Peak as an alternative).Here is where the hotel falls short- there seems to be no structural adaption from its original form. The windows are old and single pane, the doors don't seem to seal in the frame properly so you get a silhouetted glow from the hall. And the walls have not been properly insulated or sound proofed. We were awoken by the noisy squeaks of the elevator, by other guests, and by security camera technicians at various hours of the morning and night (from 12AM to 7AM). THERE IS CONSTANT NOISE! It comes from all angles, at all times. Do not expect to get a peaceful moment except in the shower. No matter how good the hotel is, its fundamental purpose is to provide a place of rest and relaxation away from home. The Clarendon fails this in a huge way. I would never recommend or revisit this hotel, no matter how tight the budget.

<Content>A wonderful hotel! Booked this hotel at the last minute on Expedia just before hopping on our flight to phoenix from Hawaii. Arrived at 4.30am and was very pleasantly surprised. Check-in was smooth and friendly. Room was spacious and very nicely furbished. Huge flat panel TV and the king size bed was fantastic. Room was very quiet (top floor of the tower). Appreciated the coffee machine in room. Bathroom was small but adequate - not a problem.The artwork in the foyer and rooms is great. Love the cowboy motifs. We didnt use the pool but it looked great. Breakfast was more than adequate and best bagels I have had for a while. Free international calls were much appreciated.Would definitely recommend to others.

<Content>not a good accomodation I stayed here with my mother over Thanksgiving weekend and found the stay very unpleasant. Although Ben Bethel will write back with defensive excuses, as I saw he did to my mother, I will give the truth from my perspective:- It was very cold in the room. I called guest services to ask why the heater in our room was not working and they stated that The days are still very warm in Phoenix so the hotel has not yet setup it's heating system. I then asked if they even had a spaceheater and the did not. I am from Flagstaff and feel like I have a pretty good tolerance of the cold, but this was ridiculous.- The breakfast (if you can even call it that) was truly only bread--muffins and bagels (not even juice). I am curious to know what this upgrade could possibly be in December. Anything is better than what it is currently.- The neighborhood is not nice. I saw a gun shop just five blocks away. Lots of construction going on with the roads as well, but at least not directly where the hotel is.- Was not very impressed with the smell of the hallways--did not get an overall feeling of things being 'fresh'.- The bathroom in the executive suite (supposedly an upgrade--I wouldn't want to find out what we had before) had a shower that was impossible to change the heat settings for unless you struggled with both hands pushing hard one direction or another to change it. Hope you like the temperature you finally get it at because it's nearly impossible to change after it's on.I travel a lot so maybe my expectations are high, but I stay in both moderate--expensive hotels and feel like I have a fair judgment on what is reasonable to expect. This hotel did not meet my minimum expectations for comfort.

<Content>A Gem My wife and I spent a week at this property on business, it is a great find! Ben (General Mgr.) and his staff were outstanding, bending over backwards to help in anyway possible. Rooms were good-sized, quiet, and had very comfortable beds. Decor is definitely hip/modern, but done tastefully We ate in the restaurant a couple of times, food was unique, outstanding, and reasonably priced. Complimentary breakfast was simple but sufficient, only recommendation would be to have more coffee available (they ran out a couple of mornings) and add some fruit options. Pool area was large with many comfortable seating options. Roof-top deck was very enjoyable, a nice place to have a cocktail and watch the sunsets. It looked as if they were doing some fine-tuning to the pool and hot tub while we were there, but everything worked well during our stay. I spend a couple of weeks a year in the Phoenix area on business, this will be the new hotel of choice.

<Content>Disappointed This hotel's looks were greatly exaggerated on its website. The staff were great, for the most part. But the place is very, very drab on the outside (I literally gasped when my daughter and I drove up), and is painted with purple walls and red and black carpet on the inside. The pool is small, and nothing like the pictures on the website depict. But the biggest problems:1. The weather was COLD for Phoenix - 43 degrees that night - and no heat in the hotel. We were cold, and when we called the desk, we were told that the Phoenix weather was not cold enough to turn on the heat yet. They offered no assistance.2. The bed was facing the window, and there were many streetlights on the outside which lit our room throughout the night. No drapes, just a flimsy shade covering the window, causing me a great deal of grief, as I could not sleep well all night. 3. The free breakfast as described on the website, consisted of bagels, packaged cream cheese, and store-bought muffins with coffee. that was it. No juice, no fruit. Blah. What a disappointment. And yes, there is nowhere to sit when you get your food off of the small table it sits on. 4. And last, but not least, the artwork was very strange and offensive. There is one wall near the lobby elevator with 3 pictures of a nude woman by a pond, and on another wall, a series of about 100 pictures of another naked woman, I believe holding a pitchfork? I was embarrased for my daughter. I was bummed that I spent 11,.000 of my hard earned credit card points on this place. Oh well, that's the chance you take for believing what you see and read from a website.

<Content>Getting better stayed for a couple of nights over thanksgiving weekend...first the positives...great room amenities, beds are great, toiletries first rate, in room wolfgang puck coffee, complimentary continental breakfast internet...negatives...the hot tub which supposedly is very large was freezing cold when we arrived; as well as the pool....was assured the would be fixed by staff and management...these problems were never fixed until we had to leave; so much for the pool amenities....the lounge next store is very nice and the food reasonably priced...the surrounding area is relatively run down...hopefully this will change when the rail system is up and running...an area definitely in transition...

<Content>Original stay When i arrived to the hotel i was kind of scary because of the looks not from the outside but where the rooms are. They look like motel rooms( I didn't know that was the look) I entered the room and I was in shocked spacious, modern, aveda toiletries, free international calls and I can still mention more....the pool area was in construction and it looked very glamourous with beds and vivid colors. The only but is the bathroom too small and it needs a little remodeling. I called for free to Honduras, Central America. I would definetely go back.

<Content>Cool Hotel that has a FUN, FRESH Appeal. I had the luxury of staying at the Clarendon Hotel in early Nov. By no means was the pool completed but I can't wait to go back and see it done. It was shaping up nicely and tile was laid. The staff was WONDERFUL!!! I am always out looking for a fun, cool hotel at a great rate and by far this was it. I would say that it not in the best part of Phoenix but I felt very safe. I wish that I would have had a chance to stay more than one night so I could have seen the night life their. We drove in on a Friday night and didn't arrive until 10:00pm, so we were pretty tired but it looked as though the resturant/bar was a fun place to go. If you are young and don't mind a few minor cosmectic issues (plugs  cords visible in lobby, few small issues near the bathroom in our room) But other than that it was great!!! My only request to Managment is to tell the cleaning staff to look up when cleaning. i would have never noticed but my husband did. The ceilings in the bathroom were a little dirty and to add a TV to the living space not just were the beds were. OH and the beds....FABULOUS and the window shades....very creative!!!!

<Content>A warm place to stay during a most difficult time... I had to fly to Phoenix recently when a life long friend passed away.My husband, a record producer in Los Angeles, made all of my trip arrangements, and off I went...alone and in distress.Imagine finding an oasis in the desert, except this one just happens to be chock full of artists and ultra sensitive souls.The Clarendon is fabulously fabulous, in that visually it is stunning...The beds are huge and perfect... The plasma TV is big and swell, and the restaurant beyond extraordinary.But, what I will remember most about the CLARENDON, are AMY and Justin... two incredibly sensitive and caring people, who went an extra mile, offering me a human touch, when this world weary traveller needed it the most!

<Content>Great Food  As a business traveler and seasoned patron of the Clarendon Hotel, I was excited when I arrived at the hotel to find out the new C4 Restaurant was finally open. After quickly checking in, I asked how long the restaurant had been open? It had only been open for 9 days, so once I hit the room, I eagerly strolled down to the bar and restaurant. As I entered, I was quickly greeted by Don, the general manager of the restaurant. We spoke briefly, and I then took a look at the menu. I was shocked as the food seemed so inexpensive! I beganto have second thoughts thinking how any restaurant could have quality food at such low prices. I then asked for a wine list, which was minimal. I asked Kenny, who ended up being the bar manager about the selection. He stated the wine selection was still being finalized, however the sake list was substantial. There is also a full bar.I ordered a glass of the Powers Cab, and then decided on some food. During my week long stay, I must have tried almost everything on the menu. I was absolutely surprised at the quality, taste and interesting combinations of food. I enjoyed the sushi, especially the C4 roll with peppers and cream cheese. WOW! The ahi salad was fantastic, and the crepe type dish was really good! I also have to mention the spicy chicken wings - tread lightly with the red hot sauce! As the week progressed, I heard a patron in the hotel say their burgers rivaled the world famous Delux burger in Scottsdale - so of course, I had to try the bacon Burger. It was good, however Delux still has it. :) I enjoyed all the items I ordered and the food was a great deal for the price...nothing over $10!As for the ambiance of the restaurant and bar, it was nice however it seemed a little cold. Personally, some warmer furnishing would help to create a more loungy, mingly, let's hang out for hours and chat atmosphere. The bar area has 4 huge plasma TV's which are nicefor the games during the day.All in all, I had a good experience at C4 and will return. The management, bar and wait staff were all very nice, and the bartendersare experienced. I will return in late November and look forward to sampling the finalized wine list. J~

<Content>Not your typical hotel, indeed . . . . I was scheduled to stay at The Clarendon in October. After having to ask several locals for directions to the hotel (none of whom had heard of it), I finally found it. From the outside, this is an old, unappealing building not resembling a hotel. Having some reservations about staying there, I took a quick walk inside to find a hotel in need of renovations, a completely torn up courtyard (a dirt pit where pool once was) and contractors working on various things (there was no mention of any construction taking place on the website). It appeared to me to be a hotel with long term guests (a few rooms with open windows appeared to be apartments rather than guest rooms. The website suggested a hip, chic, new boutique hotel. What I witnessed was a rundown, neon lit motel with a dirt pit courtyard as its center of attraction. Needless to say, I checked into another hotel. The website was one of the most deceptive I have encountered.By the way, unless a miracle happened, there is no way the pool would be opening on October 26th.

<Content>Fun and Comfortable with Great Food My curiousity about the Clarendon was well satisfied with a welcome introduction when I walked in to check it out. A quick look around and I cancelled my four night stay elsewhere. Service was friendly, the decor is just plain fun, the pool remodel looks like it will be spectacular and most of all as a business traveler the Clarendon was very comfortable. The food was outstanding and affordable. Sunset on the rooftop deck before a good dinner with a great wine made my stay memerable. Just plain outstanding!- Matt McKinnon Sacramento, CA

<Content>Awsome and so Fun! my husband and I stayed here for 3 days and 2 nights in the hot month of august. very chic hotel, being remodeled and looking amazing. we used the complimentary shuttle (electric car... bonus points from me!) to take us to several local, fine dining restuartans. we found these great places to eat on the hotel's website. even more kudos from me for suggesting such amazing food! my husband loved the large flat screen mounted on the wall. the pool area was quite comfortable and chic. also the entire room set up was perfect with refrigerator and organic bath products. the staff was so helpful in getting us anything we asked. complimentary bagels and coffee were great and really good! i just loved the feel of the place. very modern... very unlike other chains surrounding it. it will definitely be the place we stay on our next visit to phoenix!

<Content>Relaxing Quite and Great Views! I had to visit Phoenix for a week during the incredibly hot days of summer! I heard from associates in town I should check out this cute hotel off the beaten path. SO happy I did!!! I walk in and and was greeted by an incredibly welcoming and friendly staff whom I came to love during my stay! The lobby was graced with the sillohuette of a phoenix which I learned was from the old convention center. I stayed in an exectutive room on the third floor. Huge flat screen TV and nice desk area that overlooked the pool area.The bed was AMAZING! I am tall, so waking up sprawled out is awesome and the the MATRESS!!! Heaven! Lovin the L'occitane products. If you want to catch an amazing sunset, go to the roof top deck and sit at a table drink a cocktail and watch the sky change in all directions.. (Arizona has some amazing sunsets!) I do have to say, the front desk staff made my stay :) Incredibly helpful, FANTASTIC suggestions for local restaurants and shopping and just all around fun! Oh and also not having a laptop, the complimentary computer in the lobby was killer! This place had a really cool vibe, interesting, funky and quiet rooms! I am back in December and you bet I will kicking at the Clarendon!

<Content>Not your average old hotel! We had an early morning doctor's appointment in downtown Phoenix and our doctor's office had given us the name  phone number of the Clarendon. We were a little reluctant to stay in a non-chain hotel but decided it would be worth it to avoid the freeway traffic at 7:30am in Phoenix. Upon arrival, it was obvious that this was an older hotel, but the staff was very friendly. We had requested a king-size bed but there was not one available so we went ahead and took the room with two doubles. The room was clean  the beds were beautifully made. I cannot tell you how comfortable these beds were! They were so nice and we ended up glad we each had our own! The decor was very modern and the artwork was unlike anything we've seen in other hotels. Okay, this is not a 5 star resort and there was some nude artwork in the lobby. I did not notice it but my husband was quick to point it out to me. This is not what I would consider to be a kid-friendly hotel because the rooms are not large, at least the one we stayed in was not, nor was the bathroom but the size was adequate for us. The only thought I had was that the bathroom floor needed to be re-grouted. I'm sure it was clean as the entire room looked clean, but compared to the rest of the bathroom, the grout looked very dingy. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. We only wish we could've brought the beds home with us!

<Content>Clarendon: Exceptional Service, Fun Style I ended up at the Clarendon for a few hours when a late flight left me stranded in Phoenix overnight; I was referred to the hotel by the airline's booking-assistance number. Needless to say, it had been a long day, and the hotel staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. They bent over backward, including driving me to a nearby fast-food restaurant for a late-night dinner (the hotel's restaurant was under construction).The decor throughout is chic but playful. The room was clean and quiet, and linens, honor bar, and toiletries were all very nice. Altogether, a thoughtfully assembled package I'd happily recommend to anyone in the area.

<Content>Great, with tons of potential! I stayed at the Clarendon for a night during my week long AZ road trip.The hotel is beautiful inside, with a wonderful staff. The beds were better than advertised.There are only a couple of *temporary* issues - 1) the pool isn't open - it doesn't even exist yet. It looks like it's going to be nice though. I was really looking forward to a swim after my long drive through the mountains. 2) Restaraunt/bar on premises still isn't open either.

<Content>Hip staff, Great Location, Really Needs a thorough cleaning though. This place is not the 2.5 stars it is advertised as, it is just a glorfied motel - Rooms are nice, large, great bathroom amenities from France, but the floor of the tub was dirty so I HAD TO CLEAN IT MYSELF before stepping in, hotel has a good gym but an almost bizaare color scheme, areas are half painted and look abandoned, tries to be artsy but falls short, staff is young, with tattoos, nice, friendly, location is excellent downtown but out of the way so quiet, supposed to be a non smoking hotel but people just step outside of their rooms to smoke and it drifts in around the cracks and into the central air, should be enforced non smoking if advertised as such, elevator floor was filthy, this place needs a good good steam cleaning, restaurant was closed when I was there, looked out of business for quite some time, wouldn't mind a cheap Priceline stay there in the future but would NEVER recommend this place at the rack rate, no way.

<Content>An oasis in the desert After being stranded US Airways, my fiance and I weren't happy to find ourselves in Phoenix for the night, but the Clarendon was just the restful spot we needed after a harrowing day of travel. I must take exception to the people cracking on the limo service. Get over your issues with people's appearance. These staff members could not have been more solicitous. The only disappointment is that the restaurant was closed. I would be delighted to stay at the Clarendon again.

<Content>This is a hotel which you鈥檒l either enjoy very much, or hate. We鈥檝e all seen those shows where they kick someone out of their dingy apartment, and over the next 48 hours they give it a major facelift using a lot of imagination, some nifty handiwork, and a somewhat limited budget. That鈥檚 what this hotel is.The bed was very comfortable, the linens and towels very nice. The d茅cor was colorful, - my room, # 303, looked exactly like the picture on their website. It was spacious and reasonably well equipped, with a fridge and safe. Plenty of nice touches included the range of L鈥橭ccitaine bathroom supplies and a number snacks in the 鈥渉onor bar鈥? Free wireless internet is a big plus for me, and they even have a PC in the lobby for guest use.However, for all these upgrades, it鈥檚 still undeniably a former cheap motel in a neighborhood that had me somewhat nervous when I was searching for some, any, form of retail establishment to get some food. Maybe I just walked in the wrong direction, but it seemed a strange place to build a hotel.Other comments: They have a chauffer service, but it doesn鈥檛 pick up from the airport so that taxi cost me $30 plus tip. They told me over the phone that they would be able to take me to my downtown meeting in the morning, but it turned out my 9am meeting was 鈥渢oo early鈥? so I needed another taxi for that. The restaurant was closed due to flooding, 鈥?but I see it鈥檚 been like this a long time. Shame as it would have saved me cruising the neighborhood on foot, and when I booked through Hotwire I was thinking (for 3.5* !) I鈥檇 end up with a nice bar/restaurant to hang out at in the evening. Breakfast in the lobby was down to crumbs by the time I came down.On the plus side, the front desk staff was pleasant and did I mention free wireless internet? Finally, I鈥檓 impressed that the management is willing to brave these review sites. 鈥?and I did enjoy my stay and slept very well.I wish the owners luck, we need more imagination and color these days.Whether it鈥檚 for you or not depends upon what you鈥檙e looking for, and some (including myself) do get directed here unfortunately without a full disclosure of this 鈥渂outique-type鈥?establishment, 鈥ittle wonder one ends up with negative reviews.Ps, you need a new favicon 鈥?unless you鈥檙e using it to promote the Jupiter Hotel in Portland

<Content>A Romantic Escape in Downtown... Recently I had an overniter in Uptown (North Dowtown) Phoenix and had a wonderful stay at one of the few true boutiques in Phoenix. The Claredon is what a boutique was meant to be - trendy, but doesn't break the bank, centraly located to great food (Fez, Ticoz) and bars and a room you wouldnt mind holding up in for the night. The staff was pleasant and though there was construction, it was not intrusive to our stay. My partner in from out of town was thrilled since his company booked the hotel and we were meeting up downtown. It cost less and was a lot easier to manage (avoiding all the downtown one way streets).A definate recommendation for any Phoenix stay.K. L.

<Content>Ugly Building, Mold on cramped bathroom walls but covered parking! I stayed at this hotel last weekend at the recommendation of a friend. Driving up to the hotel; there is no other way to describe the hotel building other than an ugly, ugly, cinderblock, 70ish, old communist bloc look. Not much they can do about it. Checked in early (no problem) with Justin; he was nice. This is a motel, not a hotel. Rooms all have external entrances around a pool but I would hardly call this a villa. From the pool, the place looks like a quasi-dorm block/military barracks (I have stayed in both in my lifetime). Stayed in a Suite; the decorating is minimalist and quite frankly, I kind of liked it. The problems with my room were #1) Opening the door to the room and the room is damp and dark. The dampness I believe is due to a swamp cooler system and all the walls and ceiling being concrete/cement. Since none of the windows open, (which is necessary when operating a swamp cooler), the moist air just sticks to the concrete walls and the carpet. I don't like swamp coolers #2) A mold problem in the tiny cramped bathroom of the room I stayed in. Alot of hotels seem to always skip the bathrooms during remodels; this place is no exception to that rule. #3) No glassware in the room. Come on folks, at least one glass (and I mean glass) on the very nice bathroom sink is expected. (Jason did bring up glassware within ten minutes after calling down; thanks Jason.) #4) Pictures on the wall were in bad shape. #5) Fridge needs to be defrosted. #6) Breakfast was a doughnut or a cheap Danish and coffee if you make it in time; no juice unless I missed it. Bananas are cheap, nutritious and easy to handle; might want to consider putting out some bananas. #7) Coffeemaker in the room is one of those that drips all over the place when you try to pour a cup of coffee; learned this quickly and poured my coffee in my plastic styrofoam coffee cup over a very nice bathroom sink. #8) Restaurant is not open and should be noted on your website that it is not open nor has it been open for a long time.Pluses for me were#1) As mentioned in many reviews, I loved the bed. It was extremely comfortable and I slept like a rock. #2) The room was well sound-proofed and quiet.#3) Covered parking in Phoenix is a treat in the summer when the temperatures exceed 100.#4) I liked the location and felt safe in the neighborhood. It was centrally located for me and not on one of the major crazy Phoenix thoroughfares. I hate Phoenix traffic; everybody drives way too fast.#5) Justin was pleasant as were the two young gals on the evening shift. Thanks for the extra coffee!I probably wouldn't stay here again in the summer due to the dampness of the room caused by a swamp cooler. Is it a swamp cooler?

<Content>Super 8 Hotel with (Cheap) Lipstick Just an awful experience - Many complaints from a guy that hardly complains at all.1. Breakfast ended early without warning. I wish I could review the breakfast items, but good luck finding any. When asked at the front desk, the guy didn't even apologize or offer any alternatives. Advice - get there at 7 AM and stock up for the entire week.2. OK, hotel was painted in trendy colors. Painting is easy, but if you don't truly upgrade appliances, sinks, and other parts of a pre-existing hotel, it's like putting lipstick on a pig. Even the painting was fairly sloppy in places. Carpet all over the building in the common areas was problematic.3. Fitness center was a joke. It is a converted hotel room, except they also took the TV out of it.4. Warning to those in the summer - rooms open to an outdoors courtyard area. This is not one of those newer hotels that have an indoor atrium. The heat hits you like a brick.5. Rooms were spacious, but bathrooms were small and there were numerous problems all around. Rooms looked like they were newly painted, but everything else inside the room reminded me of 1970s (meaning that everything appeared as if it was built in 1970s). Bathtub slowly released water (after about an hour it was empty).6. Most of the minibar items had expired dates. This isn't usually a problem for me since I hardly use it, but the special was that I would receive a $20 minibar credit. It wasn't stocked with enough unexpired items to even get to that point. I'm very curious how all of the positive reviews got here given the numerous problems that were so plainly evident. Even the service staff didn't appear all that concerned when we informed them of the problems.

<Content>Hip Hotel Falls Flat Never in my life have I had such an awful hotel experience. First, I was sent to the wrong room. Then upon inquiring about their advertised limo/town car service the employees laughed like the joke was on us. They did actually laugh. It was incredibly insulting. They didn't even pretend to care. The car was a Prius (no problem with that) but there was no one to drive it so we couldn't schedule it's use. The restaurant that's advertised to be in the hotel was closed and an employee told us that it has been under construction for the entirety of her employment and had no idea when it would re-open. Our room didn't have any of the advertised movie channels. I called downstairs to ask because I thought that maybe I made a mistake and a man told me that we in fact did have HBO but couldn't tell me how to get this channel. Next, our hot water didn't work and wouldn't turn off - it just dripped all night. There was an empty wine bottle under our bed (that we didn't drink or bring). The toilet felt like it was not bolted down, I'm not a plumber so my best description of it would be that it was wobbly. Needles to say, we didn't want to spend anymore time at this hotel so we cancelled the rest of our reservation.

<Content>Customer Service is Tops at the Clarendon My party of four stayed at the Clarendon July 6-8 to attend the UOP graduation ceremony. Overall, we had a good stay. I enjoyed the color scheme of the rooms and the hotel in general as it reminded me of Southwestern flavors from my time living in California and Texas. The rooms were clean, the beds were extremely comfortable, and we enjoyed the continental breakfast. Customer service is great at Clarendon thanks to Justin - he is The Man. Clarendon offers free local transportation via hotel vehicle driven by one of their staff. Justin made sure that we were driven to breakfast, to the drug store, to Arizona Center, and later in the evening back to the hotel. When we wanted to switch rooms at 11PM because it was just too hot up on the 4th floor to get some sleep (we had a 6AM flight back - I have since been told by the hotel folks that they are putting a new roof on that will greatly reduce the heat on the 4th floor), Justin found us another room on a lower floor right away. And when my wife left some garments in the other room, he made sure we got them as soon as we alerted him to the situation. That Saturday, July 7, I think Justin must have worked 16 hours as another employee didn't make it in. It didn't matter if we needed him at 10AM or 11PM, Justin provided top quality service and our group appreciated his time and attention.I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable, clean hotel with staff second to none. I will stay at this hotel again should my business take me to Phoenix.R.L. JenkinsChevy Chase, Maryland

<Content>Worst Experience Ever! This was the single worst experience I have ever had in a hotel. I use the term hotel very loosely. I'm saying this because I am of the understanding that the difference between a hotel and motel is that the guest enters the room of a motel from the parking lot (outdoors) whereas a guest of a hotel must enter the room from an indoor corridor. You do not directly enter this hotel from outdoors but the rooms are arranged in a type of villa setting. If that's your thing cool, but I was not prepared for that. For the $150/night myself and my two co-workers had to shell out for our rooms (for four nights) I expected to have a corridor. Anyways there were many many things that went wrong during this trip. First of all the heat was not working at all. Our rooms were extremely cold at night. We kept complaining but were told that it was being worked on. Finally on the third night we were offered extra blankets, only there were only two blankets and a space heater. I got stuck with the space heater and while I was drying my hair the breaker for the room got tripped. When I went to the desk to get the power turned back on I was told you shouldn't have been running the space heater while you were drying your hair. Like I was supposed to know that the room had poor wiring. If they had just apologized for the inconvenience instead of blaming it on me, I wouldn't have been as upset.Then there's the issue with the Shuttle. We did not rent a car b/c we thought there was this great shuttle. Hardly. You had to sign up for the shuttle the evening before for the time you needed to be dropped off and picked up. So I'm sure you can imagine how difficult it is to get the shuttle for dinner if you are staying with people who don't make up their mind where they want to go to dinner until like an hour before their ready to go. We ended up taking cabs pretty much everywhere. Then on our last day we were told that the shuttle could drop us off at our meeting and then pick us up when we were ready and take us to the airport. I specifically asked even if we've already checked out of the hotel and the response was oh yeah that's fine. Then the last day comes and we are packing our suitcases into the trunk and ask the driver to make sure and he says Oh no. I'm not allowed to pick you up after you've checked out. There is too much liability Whatever that means. The point is the staff was not very competent, during our trip.We were offered a discount for the inconvenience of the heat not working, but that does not make up for the incompetence.Anyways there is more of the same that went on but I will stop here because it's just making me more upset just thinking about it. All in all I will never stay there again and I will definitely not be recommending this place to anyone.

<Content>A Great Stay! I stayed here during Memorial Day weekend. It was a great experience overall. This was my first time at a boutique-style hotel. Upon check-in arrival staff informed me that the air conditioning was not working, but that they had a team working on it around the clock. (Being that I had just driven 300+ miles from LA and it was 102 degrees outside, that was the last thing I needed to hear). However it was eventually fixed within several hours. The staff was very friendly  more than accommodating. Upgraded me to a Jr. suite  gave me 25% off total bill (All without me even putting up a fuss). The room was very nice, very quite  spacious! Personal Highlights:鈥ost/Value鈥ree parking 鈥?2 Plasma TV鈥he bed was like sleeping on a cloud! 鈥he spa setting on the Shaper Image alarm/radio.鈥ree internet access鈥ocationOnly disappointment was that the on site restaurant/bar were closed for flood repairs.This was my 1st time visiting the Phoenix area, but if I ever return I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Not So Good My husband and I stayed for an evening during the first weekend in May. I hate to say this because it sounds like the manager is a nice person and the service was good, but the hotel is a bit creepy. This is certainly a case of a hotel website description and photos being misleading.I ceratinly agree that for the price, we should not have expected the Ritz Carlton. However, hotel rates in Phoenix are not outrageous as it is, and their rates somewhat reflect the going market.Therefore, you are not getting a great deal staying at the Clarendon. Yes, when we checked in, the restaurant was closed due to water damage - no big deal as we did not plan to eat the hotel. Our room was quite musty and very dark. We settled in and decided to freshen up before heading out. Unfortunately, the toilet would not flush. We called the front desk and they sent the maintenance man up (he arrived quickly and was very nice). He told us it was part of the problem that several of the rooms had and moved us to another room. The second room was equally dark, drab, and musty. Yes, the toilet worked in the second room but the shower did not. We could not control the shower temperature and were burned everytime we got in.At that point, we didn't want to move our rooms again so we dealt with it. Also, I the shower knob was broken so I had to have my husband turn the water on and off everytime I showered. Again, we could have called and been moved again but we did not want to deal with the inconvenience again.The mini-refrigerator, metal furniture, and odd lighting choices gave me college dorm flashbacks. The rooms are not cheap and chic as they would lead you to believe - more cheap and yucky.The location of the hotel is a bit odd. It is in the middle of a not so great neighborhood (transients hanging around outside) and there is no secure parking for cars.Again, I hate saying these things as the management certainly seems hard to please and everyone was helpful, but overall, the hotel was a bit creepy.

<Content>Wonderful Surprise! I would highly recommend this hotel. While others have suggested that the outside needs some updating, we found it to be just perfect and more European in design. The room was delightful and unique in its presentation and again, had a much more European feel to it. The customer service was excellent. Parking and location was easy and safe. The hotel is located midtown/downtown and is close to other attractions. If you are tired of the typical corporate chain cookie-cutter hotels, this is a perfect choice for getting off the beaten path. For future business and social travel to Phoenix, the Clarendon will be our hotel of choice.

<Content>Clarendon: the best place in Phoenix! I frequently visit Phoenix and from now on I only want to stay at the Clarendon! Love it!The beds are super comfortable, and I think the rooms are the quietest I've ever stayed in. I could have slept forever. Employees great, helpful, friendly, cool. My room was ready for early check-in. Everything very clean. And it's so original! Loved the colors and the artwork both in the rooms and in the lobby. Loved the t.v., the bath products. This place rocks and I wish all hotels were like this.The biggest complaint? Hmmmm. I could have used a hook for my robe in the bathroom. And that's all I can think of. Perhaps extended cable but then I'd probably have to pay more so it's fine as is.Not sure what previous comment was about feeling unsafe. Disagree. And it's near everything, downtown and Chase Field, the Heard, the Phoenix Museum of Art, shopping, restaurants.

<Content>A Work in Progress I stayed two nights in early May, as the temperatures were starting to rise in Phoenix. For $109 per night, I think that this hotel is a terrific deal. On the positive side, the room was very clean, recently renovated and had an outstanding quality bed and pillows. The new flat screen TV was terrific. The free local and long-distance telephone service turned out to be a real asset. The work space and closet were great. The Aveda amenities were a plus.When I came to my room both nights, music was playing and the lights were on. While this was in some ways a pleasant and ethereal effect, the environmentalist part of me wishes that they would save a few cents on electricity and just leave one light on.There were three bigger issues. First, the WiFi did not work in my room. That turned out to not be a big deal as I could use my Treo to access the internet, but I can imagine for some business travelers that this would be very annoying. This needs to get fixed or the hotel needs to not put people needing WiFi in rooms that do not have functional WiFi. Second, the AC did not work well in my room. Despite turning down the temp, I was really not able to get the room to come to a comfortable level for sleeping. The staff suggested I turn up the fan; quite honestly, that just made more noise but did not solve the problem. This is an issue the management really needs to fix. Third, the continental breakfast is pretty bare bones -- coffee and muffins. The bran muffins were really good, but that was about all there was. In addition, a sense of disrepair was reinforced by the fact that the restaurant was not operating due to water damage. So, to get dinner at 8:00pm, I needed to walk four blocks over to Central, where, in fact I had a terrific meal at Fez. I did not find the area unsafe or a problem, and the desk staff correctly assured me it was not. However, there were few people on Clarendon, so for some I can imagine it could be a bit spooky.Finally, on a positive note, the desk staff did a great job of getting me a limo that knew how to avoid the morning rush hour traffic and get me to Sky Harbor in 15 minutes. That was MUCH appreciated.If you are on a limited budget, give the Clarendon a try. From what I could see they are working to make the place better, and I expect that they will succeed.

<Content>If the W Chain Had Motels, it would look like this Lest the debate over this property continue, I join in the fray. I just completed a two night stay at the Clarendon. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience--above all because I kept my expectations in check. In short, the Clarendon is a quirky, boutique MOTEL-like property, with a truly wonderful staff that makes you overlook--and forgive some of the problems you may encounter. At no time did I confuse (or attempt to compare) the Clarendon with the W hotel, or other up-market hotels or resorts (as others before have). But then again, I paid considerably less than I would have at such other hotels. Yes, the beds are wonderful (and perhaps are the same as used by Ritz, or the Four Seasons), the linens/towels are high quality (certainly well above a motel), the bathroom was kitted with Aveda bath products, and the flat screen TV in my junior suite was nicer than the one in my home. These were the amenities I truly appreciated and which make the Clarendon better than a motel. However, the basic feel and layout is that of a motel. The size of the bathroom was awful. Not until the final morning did I finally get hot water in my shower; the rooms and hallways (though painted in funky colors and motifs) are disgusting concrete; there is only so much anyone can do with that. The air conditioning was a joke ( the temperatures were already soaring above 90 degreees outside and the room air conditioner could not keep up. I cannot imagine what it will be like in the Summer). If only the water in my shower was as warm as the air from the air conditioner. The restaurant and bar was closed during my 2 nights stay, and the workout rooms were dark and dingy. Finally, the staff is not set up to accomodate business people. The fax machine ran out of paper and I had to bring that to their attention when I did not get my complete document, another time when I had to send out a fax, even though I brought it down at 5am (which should have indicated some degree of urgency to get it out), the staff did not send out the fax for 3 hours, and finally, one fax that I received on my first day was not presented to me until checkout! The only reason I did not loose it was that I had just been presented my bill, which was ridiculously reasonable. You are not nickeled and dimed to death on phone calls or other service charges here. And as I said earlier, the staff is so nice, so helpful, and so eager to please (though they may fall below the mark), you cannot get angry at them. So, all in all, as long as you are not expecting to stay at the W hotel, or a resort, but instead are looking for a great central location, very reasonable prices, and some nice extras that make this property well above your typical motel, you will be content. The next time I am in Phoenix, if I can afford (or am willing to splurge for) the Biltmore, I will stay there. But if not, I will be happily returning to the Clarendon. I just hope they do something about the a/c in the rooms. This is Phoenix, you know.

<Content>Hip Motel This is not a resort hotel by any means but the service is good, staff very helpful and the free car service great. Rooms are nice - not luxurious but well laid out and comfortable. Bathrooms are small. The rooms open onto outside corridors overlooking a small pool, rather like a motel. Nice roof terrace to watch the sunset. Not sure about location, not a great deal within walking distance like most of Phoenix. Good budget option but don't expect a luxury hotel. This is more a young, cool and trendy place.

<Content>Good Budget Choice in Phoenix First, the customer service at the Clarendon, from the restaurant to the front desk, was outstanding; have not experienced better service in PHX/Scottsdale, and although that's not saying much, it was most appreciated. Camus, the onsite restaurant, was very good--very good menu; succinct wine list with some depth to it. Food was quite tasty.Some other reviewers commented that the neighborhood is sketchy, what Phoenix neighborhood isn't slightly sketchy? I think the neighborhood was fine, being mostly white-collar commercial midrises, was very quiet in the evening. Seemed quite safe to me.At 200 bucks a night less than the Valley Ho, for example, this hotel is a good deal. Bed is comfortable. Nice wall mounted plasma TV; Aveda amenities. My only real complaint is the room got no real natural light (one very small window only) and there was no do not disturb sign to place on the door--and housecleaning was knocking at 7:30 this morning, a bit early for me.But a nice find nonetheless; and restaurant Camus is really a treat.

<Content>LOOK NO FURTHER! Ben Bethel has created one of the greatest experiences of hospitality in the WORLD!Background: I was sent to the Clarendon because the Hotel at which I had a confirmed reservation was overbooked (big conference in town). After a day of flight delays I was already in a grumpy mood. So, I figured there was nothing that was going to make me feel much better. Then the driver pulled up to the Clarendon!The staff was more than friendly, they were family. They treated this weary road-worn warrior with a special touch of kindness. Then the art deco and spacious room layout swept me off my feet. I called my wife immediately and said, Honey, let me tell you, if I were to design my own hotel this is EXACTLY the way I would want it to look and feel. It represents the best of European flavor with a gentle and soothing nouveaux ambiance.Everything about this place lulls you into a peaceful respite, and just when you think you've had the greatest experience of your life you'll find more. Even the complimentary limo (using an alternative fuel vehicle) and drivers were helpful and prompt.I want to thank the Claredon and staff for sprinkling stardust on what was looking like a travel disaster. You guys sparkle and shine. I told the staff, 鈥淚 don鈥檛 want to give my key back . . . I haven鈥檛 found a hotel, and I鈥檝e found a home鈥?

<Content>Great Stay! I loved this hotel, it is a great 'find'. The bed was wonderful, the staff was extremely friendly and attentive, and the pool area was very enjoyable. This was my first trip to Phoenix and I had to travel throughout the city during my stay, this hotel was near the center of everything. You can definitely tell the owner takes great pride in this 'boutique' style hotel and has done a wonderful job with this property!

<Content>Very unique and special experience Reviewer: DrewDate of stay: March 19, 2007We can not more strongly recommend this hotel. My wife and I were stranded in Phoenix due to airline cancellations. We were returning from a resort in Mexico. The stay was wonderful and the bed in room 303 was possibly the most comfortable in which we have ever slept. The staff was very friendly and helpful and diner at Camus was excellent. We were not pleased that we could not get back to South Carolina that night. However, our experience at this hotel quickly made us forget our unhappiness. We are not sure when or if we will be back to Phoenix again. However, should we make it back; we will definitely stay the The Clarendon. Thank you very much.

<Content>Best night's sleep ever!! What a charming place to stay! Everyone was very pleasant and helpful. The staff went out of their way to make sure I was taken care of. And the mattress ... this was seriously the best night's sleep I have ever had. I was so awed with the bed that I am planning to purchase the same mattress they use in the hotel so I can re-create the experience at home. You won't be disappointed!

<Content>Another Great Stay at the Clarenedon - This is the second time I have stayed at the Clarendon Inn and Suites - and the experience ws even better the second time around. I stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms - and the same attention to detail I found during my first day was found - the bed was great - the bathroom newly renovated - flat screen tv and the senseo coffee maker all there. In addition to the rooms - the staff at the hotel was great - they are friendly and always ready to help with a great suggestion - whether it is where to find a great burger or where are great places to shop or go sight seeing. I would recommend the Clarendon to anyone looking for a great hotel experience in Pheonix

<Content>Modern Comfort at the Clarendon Hotel  Hotel staff provided prompt and courteous service to address our every need. The interior decor reflected modern style and charm with four-star comfort. The pool area was a delightfully bright place to cool off on those hot Phoenix days. We highly recommend the Clarendon Hotel and Suites.

<Content>Interesting Property, Great Staff Just spent a week at The Clarendon and will definitely stay there again the next time I am in Phoenix. Ben Bethel, the manager, is to be commended for his rejuvenation of this historically and architecturally significant hotel. (Ask the staff about the hotel鈥檚 fascinating history.) Clearly, this has been a labor of love for him. But his skill as an hotelier shines through in two very important aspects. The first is his attention to the details of design. The second is his ability to recruit outstanding people who share his commitment to excellence; Alicia, Carlos, and the rest of the staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the city. Combined with considerate amenities such as free wireless internet connection, free car service, and its excellent restaurant , Camus, The Clarendon is once again a vibrant part of the city.

<Content>Disappointed I always check the tripadvisor website for hotel reviews before I decide which hotel to book and so far it has never failed me till I stayed here. 1. Someone from their management cancelled my reservation, good thing I had the confirmation letter they sent by email printed out with me. I arrived late that night and was really tired. The guy at the front apologized and instead of giving me a better room for the inconvenience tried to downgrade me because of the unavailability of the room I originally booked.There was a girl who happen to just wander by from management as well who had to help him get me a better room ( hellooo !!!- this is what youre supposed to do).2. The one bedroom suite was ok. There is no TV in the living room area. Bed was comfortable.3. Hotel close to a sketchy area.4. They did not clean my room one of the nights.5. Camus restaurant was fabulous however.

<Content>"Melrose Place" in Phoenix The rooms are stylish with favorable toiletries and comfy beds. The pool area lends itself to a full on hotel party with all of the rooms facing inward. The customer service was definitely the most memorable. We were escorted to and from dinner and all of our requests were met with a smile.We enjoyed a girl's night out that we won't forget!

<Content>Awful Experience My wife  I stayed at this hotel March 8th  9th. We did not know what to expect based on the write ups on this website. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. This hotel is nothing more than an old 70's style motel with a fancy paint job. The rooms have old, dirty carpetting. The walls are paper thin  you can hear every noise taking place in other rooms  outside the hotel. The bathrooms are very small. The sink area is placed in the bedroom and their is NO counterspace. The good news is the mattresses appear very new and the beds are very comfortable. The furniture appears to be clearance items purchased at IKEA and is very postmodern but not very useful.The lobby is also an assorted mess. Instead of a front desk, they have, well a pair of desks! B/c of this setup, you can overhear every phone conversation. The one wall consists of 4x6 pictures of a naked woman with full frontal nudity. This is totally inappropriate outside of an art museum. Their is a continental breakfast put out each morning, however, I did see some good sized roaches crawling underneath the table where this is put out. Overall, this hotel had the ambiance of a cheap motel. It is certainly not worth the price they are asking. I would not recommend this to anyone or stay here again.

<Content>Can Find Better for the Price Well, I managed to get a fantastic rate for this hotel via an online booking site, so I really can't complain at all. However, if people are truly paying $100-200/night, I feel as if I should warn them.The front desk was very friendly and very helpful-- but they have to be friendly and helpful when the key making machine wasn't working right and the wireless internet was down.The hotel has been recently painted and decorated and was clean, but you can tell that it is an old building with surface fixings. My sink was new and nice (and the Aveda bath products were nice as well) but everything else (floor, shower) in the bathroom was old.My bed was huge and very comfortable. I have no complaints about the bedroom itself.The wireless internet worked very poorly for about an hour later in the night, so this was very frustrating.The pool and hot tub area was cool and modern looking.Like I said, for what I paid I got a great deal, but if you are planning on spending more than $80/night on a room in Phoenix, I would suggest going elsewhere.

<Content>Nice Boutique Hotel Experience I was on a last minute business trip and all the cities hotel rates were double because of conventions. Expedia found this nice boutique hotel that was close to downtown but off the beat and path. It's located in a residential type area. I really liked the very metropolitan feel with all of the clean lines and unique furnishings.Alicia was great. She changed my room so that I would have better internet reception to work that night. Really enjoyed the stay. Reminded me of the south outside and New York inside.C. Williams

<Content>Loved it!!! Loved this hotel, I am local who frequents the hotels around town and I just loved this hotel, its colorful, and the staff was very nice and attentive to my needs. I appreciate a hotel such as this because its a place where you feel welcome, loved the bath products and the beds were wonderful. The pool looked great but for a local such as I, it's still a little cold for me. I'd definately recommend this hotel to my out-of-town friends, and everyone else.

<Content>Don't waste your time or money! Terrible Hotel! My husband,two friends and myself booked two rooms at this hotel to celebrate a birthday. Most of the promised amenities were not available. Neither room came with heat or blankets for the beds,the website promised down comforters. When I finally got maintenance to bring some bed covers,they consisted of one polyester blanket per room. No hot water kettle,coffee or tea,and the local/organic snacks consisted of Pringles and MM's. The tub was covered in grout and the shower leaked,when you finally got it turned on. To top it all off our friends had an extra room mate, a very large cockroach! Wi Fi was down the whole time and work on unfinished rooms began at 7:30 am. New paint,carpet,fancy tv's and furniture mean nothing if the basics don't function! I would suggest management take a trip to the Bay Area and visit a real boutique hotel.For the money you can book a much nicer room closer to or right downtown.

<Content>Avoid at all costs I have traveled extensively throughout the world and this is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in. I have so many complaints about this hotel it's hard to know where to start. The overall theme of this hotel seems to be trendy boutique. Ha. It's more like a motel 6 with different colored paint on the cement walls. Granted, the sink in my bedroom was a slightly upgraded sink, but it's still a sink in the bedroom. We got there in the morning to be greeted by mattresses lined up outside the hotel. Seems like all the rooms were not finished yet. There were major problems at check in with some people not receiving their rooms until 5pm. I guess those were the rooms they had to finish building. One guy in our group had to lay a towel in his bathtub because the grout, which was still wet, kept coming off. As for the free internet, it is free but it doesn't work. The only way I could get a signal in my room was to stand by the door and hold my computer up and even then it kept going in and out. For people who like their room dark while they sleep, good luck. Curtains aren't hip at this hotel. Instead they have this painting that one pulls over to cover the window. Fine but it doesn't cover the whole window. I had a one foot gap at the top which was very annoying once the sun started to come up. Although, when I think about it maybe that doesn't matter as I wasn't able to sleep very well anyway. There is no air conditioning at this hotel and the room was stifling hot during the day and at night. Yes, you do have aveda products in the bathroom. I would have traded those in for a shower that works though. More water was coming out of the bathtub faucet than the showerhead. And that upgraded sink in the bedroom? They didn't upgrade anything in the bathroom. It took me asking 4 times throughout the day for a tv remote that worked. It would have been faster for me to walk to the nearest shop and by the batteries myself. Although from the look of the surrounding neighborhood, I wouldn't want to walk. This hotel is not in a decent part of town and is not near anything. They do have a shuttle car service but it's one person and one small car so if he's out somewhere else you have to wait. The gym needs a lot of work but it does fit into the motif of the whole hotel needing alot of work. No towels or water fountains so bring your own to the gym. Overall this hotel is a Motel 6 with trendy furniture. Give it a pass as there are better hotels in the phoenix area with free internet, ac, room service......things that work!

<Content>No Air Conditioning at the Clarendon! At that's not all! We stayed at the Clarendon for one night over President's Day weekend. We had planned to stay two nights, but the air conditioning was not working and the room was unbearably hot and miserable, so we left after one night. We received a small discount, but honestly it was not enough to compensate for a truly sleepless night. But there's more. We travel a fair amount, and this hotel is substandard in every way. Please read: When we checked in, we overheard a staff member talking on the phone about how she wasn't sure she could continue working at the Clarendon as she was on probation and it had to be ok'ed-we're assuming by her probation officer. Didn't make us feel real comfortable about handing over our credit card. Our room was very warm and smelled musty when we entered, so we immediately turned on the AC. We left for a couple of hours for dinner, but when we returned it was still very warm. We called the desk, and they said they did not have AC, only a chiller (which was broken, we found out in the morning) and suggested we open the windows and turn on the small fan on our bedside table. We opened the window for awhile, but it was noisy due to traffic and aircraft in the area. We stayed the night, but we were hot and sticky and uncomfortable the whole time. In the morning we went to the front desk and explained that we needed to leave because we were unable to sleep due to the lack of AC. They then admitted the cooler had broken and because it was a holiday weekend, it would be hard and expensive to get someone to fix it. Other things you should know about the Clarendon. It is in an area of Phoenix that should be OK if you stay in a group, but not a place to be alone. The hotel rooms are concrete block with a bad stucco finish and a poor paint job. The bathroom was literally no bigger than 5 by 5 feet, the tub area has had a poor quality refinishing job, and the sink is not in the bathroom. The carpet is really carpet squares, the closet is covered with a curtain rod that was loose and falling off the wall. The curtains are stretched canvas paintings that slide over the windows, however the one in the bedroom was not big enough to cover the entire window so the bedroom had an eery light from the parking lot all night. I accidentally touched the inside of the window when I opened it and my fingers turned black from dirt-they were that dirty on the inside! There is an honors bar area filled with Pringles, MM's and a $25 condom kit. The hotel is marked as nonsmoking, but we noticed cigarette butts on the stairwells. The breakfast consisted of two dirty looking coffee pots with coffee filled with grounds, bagels with nothing but jelly to spread on them, two types of muffins, and a few dried out looking danish. The staff was friendly, but unable to give the simplest of directions, like how to get to the nearby highway. This is truly among the worst places I have ever encountered in my travels. I would recommend it (with hesitation) to the homeless, 20 somethings who truly enjoyed dorm living, and perhaps those who need to make a 12 hour international phone call to a loved one (calls are included in your room). And even then remember that there may not be AC.

<Content>False advertising, glorified motel The website for this hotel is misleading. This hotel is a revamped parking garage with bad service and even worse amenities. The staff was rude, the rooms were deplorable raw concrete dressed in the guise of hip. I felt misguided by expedia in recommending this hotel. We were miles away from where we were promised and spent far more money than what this was worth. I have travelled throughout the world, and overall, I have never been more disappointed. Do not stay here.

<Content>Try The Clarendon Hotel and Suites! I LOVE this hotel. I come to Phoenix regularly on business, and The Clarendon is my favorite Phoenix hotel. The rooms are sparking clean (lots of white), there is a separate room for work space and lounging, the bed is huge and nicely firm, everything works properly, and the wireless internet is fast and completely reliable (which is all too rare). The staff is lovely. You come into the lobby and there is a table at the end with two computers, some chairs in front, and two well informed, professional staff who greet you, provide help and advice, and say hello every time you walk past during your stay. And there is a huge bonus -- Camus restaurant, and for the younger and hipper crowd, its bar. I am female and over 60, so I am not looking for hip, but I do like well prepared food. This is a really fine restaurant that serves much of its menu till 1:00 a.m. Since I usually get in late (flying from the East Coast after work), I really love not having to settle for fast food. Last week I had lamb pops (little rib lamb chops) and a cobb salad terrine with duck and avocado among its ingredients. There are also great hamburgers. The breakfast menu is small, but if you ask for something, they generally will prepare it for you.This is a perfect hotel for people who want good work space, and equally nice if you want a place to relax. It is a huge bargain.

<Content>Loved It! My boyfriend and I had just arrived in town for the holidays, exhausted from traveling. The hotel I originally booked was horrible in that even though I had requested a non-smoking room they could not provide me with one. Now being pregnant, that was not going to fly. So after meeting up with my parents, they decided to help us out by scouting out the midtown area by Park Central. They found the Clarendon Hotel  Suites where they were given a very reasonable price and a tour of the hotel. So we met my parents down there and were pleasantly surprised at the hotel. It was like nothing I've seen before. They even bumped us up to a suite. The staff was so pleasant that we would leave them candy. After all, it was over Christmas. I loved the look, the pleasant staff and the area was perfect. I would definitely make this my regular place to stay when I come back to visit.

<Content>Exceptional Service! I recently moved to Phoenix for my work and had the privilege of staying at the Clarendon Hotel and Suites for three nights during my first days in the city. The staff at the Clarendon greeted me before I checked in, offered several helpful recommendations about places to eat and services within the community, and made sure that everything about my suite was to my liking.The Clarendon features a unique, renovated appearance with a wonderful pool and spa area inside a courtyard surrounded by the walls of the hotel. It is a short drive or cab ride to many restaurants, great shopping, sports venues, and theaters. If you want to stay on site to dine or relax, there is a great restaurant and bar located at the hotel. The neighborhood around the Clarendon Hotel and Suites appeared to be safe and was nicely lit, there was plenty of free parking at the hotel, and the grounds of the hotel and the individual rooms were clean and well maintained.For me, what truly defined my experience and would prompt me to return to the Clarendon was the individual attention that I received during my stay. Overall, it was a great guest experience!

<Content>Home away from home A stay at the Clarendon Hotel and Suites is simply the best. Having to be in Phoenix at least 3 times a month for more than several days at a time can be challenging. The hotel has become a second home for us and I do mean home. The management and staff are very freindly as well as accomodating to ones needs. You will be greeted with a friendly hello when you arrive, a good morning at the beginning of the day, and a thank you for staying with us when you checkout. This is a very hip and modern hotel and the rooms are extremely comfortable and clean. I love the fact that the hotel has a non smoking policy in all rooms! The hotel has an awesome pool and Jacuzzi area. For me , being a music lover, the hotel plays music all day in the pool area, Jazz, Blues, Standards and Ballads. This hotel is privately owned and it is very evident that they have a hands on approach to detail. They work very hard to make your stay a positive and comfortable stay. We have met people from all over the world staying at the Clarendon. The Clarendon Hotel is truly an Oasis in the Desert. 24 hours a day you can count on The Clarendon Hotel to be an awesome hotel.  Sincerely, Patrick and Chris

<Content>Great service at the Clarendon We recently stayed at the Carendon Hotel and Suites in Phoenix. The reception staff are the best we have come across - very helpful and friendly. This hotel is nicely appointed and the rooms are super comfortable. The bed is the most comfortable we experienced in our six weeks of travels. Wireless access was available and free. It is also possbile to print documents in the lobby. We felt this hotel offered great value - great range of bathroom amenties. The hotel really seemed to be genuine about customer service and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The hotel is in downtown Phoenix and a car is required to get around this city!

<Content>great stay at the Clarendon Hotel + Suites My night in downtown Phoenix started out with a rocky start, as i got lost on the maze of freeways. But when I called the Claredon I spoke to Tonya, on night shift and she helpfully guided me in. When I arrived, she was so friendly, I felt that I was right at home and breathed a sigh of relief.The rooms were spacious, with a big comfy bed, and bathrobe provided but my favorite extras were the Aveda tolietries that are provided. The next morning I was happy to find there was no cost internet access in the lobby.My only complaint is that didnt know that there was FREE unlimited international calls from the room. I have done some traveling but have never come across this. Next time I stay, Ill be bringing my phone book and settling down for some long talks across the time zones.

<Content>Like a Hostel for Cool Grown-Ups This is a review of my experience at the Clarendon Hotel + Suites, from August 25, 2006, to August 27, 2006. I was in room 309...a large suite.My experience with hotels runs the gamut. From suites at the grand hotels of Europe (Le Sirenuse, Claridges, the Adlon, the Crillon, the Goldener Hirsch, etc.) to exceptional US properties (various Ritzes, Waldorf Towers, Auberge, Post Ranch Inn, Bacara, etc.) to boutique hotels, as well (Sydney House in London, Arcotel Velvet in Berlin, Blakes in Amsterdam, etc.). I share this because Clarendon gave me an entirely new experience, which I did not really think possible after decades of travel to hotels big and small, great and good (and yes, some downright lousy).Travelers to the Clarendon should prepare themselves for a hotel that is not sizzling with high-end design (although the rooms are pleasantly appointed and the whole place is VERY clean). But the design that is there is really cool. LED desklights, sliding shades that feature reproductions of the artwork in the lobby, enormous rooms, an exquisite sound system playing big band and jazz standards by the pool, the same sun chairs I lounged on in Positano earlier this summer and the exterior painting and lighting all conspire to delight. You aren't going to get a Phillipe Starck tour de force here, but you will get a feeling that the owners care enough to provide you with far more than the average Holiday Inn.But enough of design, because what the world DON'T need now is a design hotel without the basics nailed.And this, dear readers, is where the Clarendon knocks 'em dead.Service. What a tragically underrealized concept in hotels today. But the staff at the Clarendon could school the buffoons at MUCH higher end properties in what service means. Always greeting guests. Always asking if they can do that one extra step to help? Always producing the unexpected (for instance, with the no liquids rule at airports, we found ourselves without sunscreen. Would the desk have a bottle we could use? You bet they did.).And this wasn't just a bunch of hip young people helping out other hip young people. I observed several much older guests receiving the same level of truly engaged and respectful service and that just made me feel incredibly affectionate toward this property. The ability to experience design and a unique interaction with it should be the province of all ages, not just 20-somethings with the latest Prada swimsuit.The bed was top-notch. We did not use the TV. There is no liquor in the mini-bar (actually it's a mini-snack stack...there is no chilled beverage selection in the room). The A/C worked...not to an icy chill like many Phoenix properties, but it definitely felt much cooler in our room. The shower pressure was perfectly adequate.We did not use the bar or restaurant but peeked in and it looked appealing. The property is very close to many restaurants, bars, clubs in central Phoenix (not to mention museums) so we tried some of those instead.I told the girl at check-out that I felt I had discovered the coolest youth hostel on the planet -- only it was for grown-ups. I still feel that way. It's a lower-budget-higher-design concept paired with the absolute perfect pieces of internal architecture: a genius bed, clean property, and staff who would fit seamlessly into the finest properties in the hospitality industry.I still love my Christmases at the Arizona Biltmore -- I'm a hopeless traditionalist in many senses -- but for any other visit to town, I am going to definitely stay at the Clarendon.Congratulations to manager Ben Bethel for reminding me that it's still possible to assemble a team of flawless customer service providers within the chic walls of a modern hotel.

<Content>Fab Fab Fabulous....... I've never taken the time to write a 'Hotel' review...have traveled all over the world......but my experience @ The Clarendon was too excellent to keep to myself. The Staff....never once in need of ANYTHING as they ALL anticipated our needs and followed through. The 'Hotel'....beautiful, fun Ikea type interiors. The bed was something you just don't want to leave. Its better than anything you've ever owned yourself. If you are picky about linens then this is definitley a place you have to visit. The sheets...hight thread count but better than that....the highest quality sheet in the linen industry. We had a King suite which I suggest as it makes you feel like you are in a West Hollywood Apartment of some famous someone or something. The pool sparkled clean clean clean and there are these wonderful chase lounges poolside that I have to find out where they bought them. Striped towels make you feel like you are on a cruise. Just a gorgeous boutique Hotel. We didn't sample the fare @ their Restaurant because of other engagements but you should.....the menue is eclectic and concise w/ wonderful choices. The Restaurant interior which is located in the Lobby was just like the rest of the property....Fab/Beautiful/Fun....just wonderful. The Lobby Bar is GREAT. The locals mixed w/ the guests give you the perfect beginning, middle and end to a wonderful time in the beautiful city of PHX. Go..for fun or business but find a reason to visit PHX and stay @ The Clarendon.

<Content>Potential Home Away from Home I would stay at this hotel again if only for the service and freindliness of the staff. A minor car accident the morning of my arrival caused the locking mechanism in my rental car to break. Ben, the owner and his electrician, Gilbert, came outside, took my door apart and fixed it on the spot. Saved me tons of $$$ on the car considering that I opted to waive the insurance. My room was upgraded to a wonderful suite overlooking the pool with custom furniture, 2 TV's and the most comfortable bed outside of my own! Will definately come back, but will rethink coming back in the summer (122 degrees!!!!)

<Content>The Clarendon is a must stay! I just had my second stay at the Clarendon Hotel last week. I can't wait for my third. First and foremost, this hotel has excellent beds and pillows. The art deco of the room decor is warm and exciting. The staff made me feel like a king. They offer all the amenities you would want while traveling with a touch of art and class. But did I mention the beds and pillows? That's what you need in an overnight stay -- comfort, comfort, comfort. I give it two thumbs up.

<Content>Friendly staff, neat hotel! My husband and I stayed at the Clarendon for five nights while house-hunting. This is an older hotel that has been given some significant updates. Our room (one king) on the 3rd floor was spacious and comfortable. As one reviewer here notes, the bathroom is small, but we had no complaints -- the water pressure was great, the towels were soft and we appreciated the Aveda toiletries. The bed is indeed very comfortable, the pillows were terrific. I like the mod furniture and palette.The pool looks terrific -- I'd love to have a cocktail party there! The morning I had planned to swim, a film crew had taken over the space, so I never got a chance to actually go in. But I saw a family in there later and it looked like they were really enjoying themselves.The restaurant is better than one usually finds at a hotel and the bar is well-stocked.The BEST feature of the Clarendon, however, is the staff. Every employee we encountered was exceedingly friendly and strove to be helpful. Honestly, this place has a serious hipster vibe and therefore, I was expecting the staff to be full of itself. But they were wonderful! They gave us great dining recommendations (Barrio, Fate), printed out driving directions for us, enquired about our house shopping, offered information about the different areas, made sure we had the hotel's card in case we got lost while driving around, and so on. These employees appear to enjoy their jobs.Now, my suggestions for the management:Improve the lighting in the rooms. Even with every fixture on, the room was rather dark and we didn't want to open the window coverings because they help keep the room cooler. The desk lamp looks neat but is about as useful as my daughter's night light. At least put in one good reading lamp to use with the chair.Add a shelf in the bathroom -- there's nowhere to put personal items except on the toilet tank or beneath the sink, which is inconvenient because the base is slatted and items can fall through.Try to do something about that furnace of an elevator. Yikes, is it stifling in there.Encourage your housekeeping staff to vacuum more thoroughly. I found old crackers under the bed while looking for a misplaced garment. There was also a lot of debris under the dresser and in the corners. Yuck. Also ask them to examine the fake fur throws. Ours was stained in several places.The FLOR tiles are great but because they are dark, they hide dirt a little too well -- walk on them barefoot and you'll see what I mean. Some were actually sticky from spills.Make sure each room has phone books and a channel guide to the TV. We had neither.PLEASE make your bar a no-smoking environment. It is WAY TOO SMALL to accomodate both smokers and non-smokers. After just 30 minutes, our clothes and hair reeked. Make it part of your low-allergen philosophy and consider the health of both your guests and employees. (For the record, I live in Athens, GA, where they have just banned smoking from all bars and restaurants and guess what? These establishments are doing just fine. The smokers just step outside.)Seriously consider redirecting the bar traffic to the side of the hotel. Our room was right over the main entrance and we were awoken numerous times by loud drunks, motorcycles and sports cars revving their engines, couples arguing, two guys wrestling in the gravel, and so on. It would have been funny if we hadn't been so tired.It would be nice if the restaurant's menu was more seasonal. There were some really heavy dishes that would have been appealing in December, but not in June when it's over 100 degrees outside. (But the soup special one night, chilled asparagus bisque with smoked sea salt, was right on the money!)I understand that the owners have more renovations planned and when they are finished, the Clarendon is really going to be fabulous. Right now, I'd say it is a great hotel for the money with a terrific staff and we would stay there again in a heartbeat -- we'd just ask for a room that doesn't overlook the entrance. ;-)
