<Content>Wonderful hotel The staff of this hotel was so helpful and nice, it really set our stay out on the right foot. Our room was large and bright with plenty of toiletries and towels and robes for my husband, child and me. Room was very clean. Location was terrific...very easy to get to and from the airport and near much of what we wanted to do and see in Barcelona.

<Content>2nd time and glad we went back 2 x interconnecting rooms for family.Good rooms with all that you will need, wife liked bathroom and accessories/robes/etc etc.rooms overlooking street at back of property, suggest higher room best to avoid any noise, we were 3rd floor and no problem.The best thing is just step out the door and you are in the old city and for a short stay that is invaluable, the Ramblas is 3 mins walk away.The hotel bar is great for a nightcap with piano player setting the mood.Staff top class and friendly, all in all great for a short stay and to feel the real Barca.

<Content>Loved the location Six of us stayed at the Colon Hotel before leaving on a cruise. We all had different types of rooms - ours had 2 small balconies and faced the cathedral. It was quite a large room with a nice seating area and huge closet. The hotel staff was very friendly. The location of the hotel is perfect - there are plenty of restaurants nearby and it is only a short walk to Las Ramblas. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.

<Content>Charming with old world character we were only able to spend one night at this wonderful hotel, in the very center of the city, across from the cathedral. las ramblas was a short distance away.. unfortunately, the weather wasn't too agreeable rainy and cold, but we still ventured out and enjoyed as much as we could. our room 609 was incredible, a huge terrace with white columns surrounded the whole room with a wonderful view of the cathedral, which is still being renovated, so it is covered by scaffolding, etc...i would recommend this hotel to everyone.

<Content>Nice hotel in a great location We stayed at the Colon in Barcelona at the end of our Mediterranean cruise. Our first impression upon checking in was not great. They were very busy and we waited for about ten minutes before we were acknowledged. We got a great price on the room for two nights, $240 EU inclusive of VAT. The room was OK, carpet a little worn, but everything else was great. New flat screen TV, beds that were not hard as a rock (atypical for Europe in our experience) and the service was outstanding. We had a couple of problems with the room and someone was at our door to correct things within 5 minutes of calling the front desk.The location is fantastic - it is directly across the street from the Barcelona Cathedral and within walking distance of Las Rambles and other sights. The food in the hotel's restaurant is excellent -a fixed price 3 course meal including wine and bottled water was 22 EU and the Catalonian cuisine was excellent. The front desk people were very helpful and referred us to a private 1/2 day tour that was perfect.All together it was a very good experience and we'd stay there again

<Content>The best in Barcelona We stayed 4 nights at the Colon before leaving Barcelona on a cruise. The location is great--right across the plaza from the Cathedral. We received a free upgrade to a superior room which was very large and had a wonderful view of the facade of the Cathedral, which unfortunately is currently covered with scaffolding for renovations. It's just a short walk from the hotel to the Metro, and the staff was most helpful in giving directions and suggesting places to eat, etc. It's great to travel off-season--no crowds or lines.

<Content>Hotel Colon at Christmas Time We loved our short stay at Hotel Colon. We stayed for one night in the beginning of December. The area outside was set up with a big Christmas festival. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The room was very clean, large, and comfortable. I would highly recommend Hotel Colon to anyone visiting Barcelona.

<Content>Underrated Colon I cant imagine why this hotel isn't in the top 10 places to stay in Barcelona. Its location is completely perfect, facing the cathedral with morning sunshine on the little balconies. The staff are genuinely helpful and eager to please, and if it is old fashioned, it is in the best sense of the phrase. This is the second time I've been there and although people rave about boutique hotels tucked down alleyways they can be rather poky and dark. This is a proper Barcelona gem, full of light and charm.

<Author>Eurostar_Fan1
<Content>Added to a great stay in Barcelona Having finished a walking holiday around the Costa Brava coast, we decided to spend a few days in Barcelona as a complete contrast and the hotel offered was the Hotel Colon. It is in the most superb position, right opposite the Gothic Cathedral, which sadly is still covered in scaffolding, and within really easy walking distance of Las Ramblas, the Placa de Catalunya and the Palais de la Musica, to name but a few. The hotel offers old-world style and courtesy. We arrived early for checking - in, but were given a room immediately and without fuss. This was an inside room, (i.e. it didn't have a view of the square and cathedral), but it was well-furnished, quite stylish, comfortable, spotlessly clean and very quiet. Throughout our stay, the reception staff and doormen were unfailingly polite and helpful, particularly those on the desk in the evening. Breakfast was excellent, with an extensive array of food to choose from and professional, unobtrusive service. We didn't dine here as there are too many exciting tapas bars and restaurants on offer in town, but we did have a drink in the bar which, although a little stuffy in atmosphere, had very pleasant bar staff to compensate, and we also made use of the outside tables, which are great for people watching and just sitting with a drink listening to the music drifting across from the cathedral steps, where talented buskers were performing. We loved Barcelona and will most definitely return. When we do so, we shall very happily stay at the Colon.

<Content>Good Leisure Hotel I agree with other reviewers on this page that if you want somewhere right in the centre of Barcelona, then this hotel makes a great base for vacationing in the city.However, I was there on business. If you're planning to stay here and need such things as full internet facilities in the room, a desk to work from in the room, efficient room service, a restaurant as opposed to a cafe, air conditioning which cools below 25 degrees centigrade, your messages taken and passed on promptly - and courteous staff, then you might want to take a look at what else is available in the area.

<Content>Ideal Location This hotel is located next to the cathedral and in a wonderful old area for walking and shopping. We were treated to a large second floor room facing the cathedral although we had not requested this. The staff was very efficient and helpful. The only slight problem we had was not with the hotel but with our taxi ride to the cruise port. It would have been helpful if we had known the terminal number to aid the driver.

<Content>A great location We stayed at this hotel in July/08. It is right on the Plaza in front of the grand Cathedral. What a beautiful cathedral ! We loved the balcony room overlooking the church. When they complete the exterior refurbishment of the cathedral and take down the scaffolding, these rooms will be great. 2 blocks from the Metro, and 6 blocks from the middlle of La Rambla. 1 mile or so from the water. Hotel is old but comfortable and old world. Loved it. Lots of restaurants and shops nearby. One concern-loud teenagers hanging out late in the plaza can make it hard to sleep if you want the windows open for the cool breezes. Rooms are small but typical. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Nice outdoor restaurants nearby. Grocery store within 4 blocks. Banks within a block. Felt very safe in this old area of the city. One caution- Be careful in subways. My brother had his wallet stolen from his front pocket. Lots of pickpockets hovering near ticket machines and entrances of metro, and they are very good.. Barcelona is fantastic.

<Content>Loved Hotel Colon! Best location! Frommer's rated the Hotel Colon as best located and after staying there for three nights, we couldn't agree more. It is perfectly located, across from the cathedral and the Bus Turistic stop is across the Plaza. It is within walking distance of La Rambla, the Picasso museum, La Palau de la Musica, everything. It is even within walking distance of Tablao Cordobes Flamenco on La Rambla where we saw a flamenco show which was absolutely fantastic! What's more, the hotel has a wonderful staff, all courteous, helpful, and with great English-speaking skills. The hotel is traditional and warm, quiet and comfortable. We were travelling with our two college-age students. The hotel was perfect for them because they were able to walk back to the hotel one night, after we had retired, giving them the opportunity to go to one more bar on La Rambla and have a crazy conversation with some of the locals. One more thing ... if you arrive on Sunday morning as we did, they will be performing El Sardana, a traditional dance, on the plaza right in front of the hotel. All in all, we loved it and highly recommend it.

<Content>Glad we gave it a 2nd chance This was our second trip to Barcelona and we tried to stay here previously, but it was full. We are glad we gave it a second chance. Went with our daughter and son-in-law; who arrived before we did. They had a nice chat with the front desk and had us moved from a back room to a room facing the plaza/cathedral. The staff also sent them a bottle of bubbly to help them enjoy their stay. This was a nice touch. There can be some noise in the plaza, but the back rooms are not necessarily quieter. Hotel has a nice lobby and a good location. The rooms are typically small, but fine for sleeping. The bathroom area was OK with no difficulties.We did not have any meals at the hotel, but found nice spots for breakfast nearby and good dining in the area.

<Content>Comfortable at Colon Conveniently located right across from the Cathedral, the Hotel Colon provides comfortable accomadations, albeit simple. The Hotel has a fantastic location as it literally sits on the plaza where the Cathedral is located, and is only a 5-7 minute walk to La Rambla (one of the main walking streets in Barcelona) and the Catalunya Metro stop. The hotel staff were all quite friendly and spoke decent english, which is more than i can say for the folks at the renfe train stations! The room is clean, but its bare (bed, small desk, TV), however you won't be in the room other than to sleep. Their is a flat screen, however doesn't work that well, also their is an in-room safe. AC however was a plus as it was quite hot during my stay. Bathroom was also clean. The hotel does have bar/restaurant, however breakfast was quite expensive (I recall approximately 17 euro), and I only ate their once due to that. You can find many places along La Rambla that offer simple coffee and pastries (try the fish market off La Rambla!!..several coffee bars while you watch the vendors setup in the morning was awesome!!). You can have a drink outside, which is nice while people watching. I'd say this is a good choice economically, however if you are looking for anything else besides clean and simple, check elsewhere.

<Content>Stay elsewhere We had a reservation at the sister hotel Regencia Colon, but when we arrived on May 1, the Regencia said they had overbooked and were transferring us to the four star Colon. Unfortunately, the Colon is not up to par. The rooms were hot and the air conditioning hadn't yet been turned on for the summer. Moreover, the bedspread, carpeting, and furniture upholstery were stained and unappealing. The bed was low and lumpy. The bathroom was old with the sort of grime around the edges that is from old age not from lack of trying to clean. We checked out, paid for one night, and looked for another hotel, evenutally staying at Le Meridien. To its credit, when we complained to Utell about our experience, Colon refunded our money. The location is charming in the old part of the city, the lobby is pleasant, but the rooms need an overhaul.

<Content>Great place! We stayed in Barcelona a few years ago in the Eixample district uptown. The location of the Colon was much better. You can walk everywhere except some of the Gaudi sites. Its right on a nice pedestrian i.e. quiet square across from the Cathedral. We had booked a triple and then changed to a double but they gave us the triple at the double price. it was a wonderful room. Great view, plenty of light. We had breakfast at one of the many cafes nearby. This place must have the only American bellhop in town. Good people, good value. Enjoy

<Content>Totally tony: a class act! Very pretty, and perfectly located, we were received graciously and treated attentively throughout our stay. The bathroom was well appointed (the whirlpool bath and amenities were welcome after our long, international flight), and the dressing room/closet accommodated our American luggage better than most European hotels. We did not reserve a room with a view of the Cathedral, after seeing photos of it swathed in scaffolding on your website, but were happy with our (probably quieter) balcony on a high floor in the back. We not only had a rooftop view, but loved the Cathedral bells punctuating our days and nights. Although the room was simple, we were delighted to find reading lights bedside (another rare feature in European hotels). My husband was ill for much of our visit, and they were solicitous and accommodating above and beyond. All in all, an amazing value for the price, even with the Euro/dollar ratio.

<Content>Totally overrated This is a 4 star hotel that should be 3. Unlike to what happens to Regencia de Col贸n.We booked a room in Regencia de Colon because we had been there before and we loved it. Besides that, this hotel was extremely expensive.When we got to the Regencia de Colon, they told us that we were going to be upgraded to the Colon one so we were very happy. However, our happyness only lasted a couple of minutes till we saw our room. It was tiny for a 4 star hotel (half of the side the Regencia麓s one) dated, bare and it stank of smoke. Besides that we got a room that overlooked the cathedral which was on works so the noise was totally unbearable, specially in the mornings. The toilet was also old and quite dirty.We were very disappointed with the hotel and wanted to go back to the Regencia one but they told us that is was overbooked! So it was our last time in this chain.

<Content>Absolutely rude and not honorable. While indeed the location is quite nice the service and treatment by the staff was rude and not honorable to the rate we were guaranteed. Instead, I was charged almost double. Our bathtub had 5 - 6 inches of water fil up in it - and even when a technician came to check it - nothing was resolved. We left this hotel and were willing to pay for the Meridien - a wonderful stay where the customer is treated right and given decent accomodations - that are liveable.

<Content>Well located, comfortable and traditional hotel. Stayed for a few days over New Year at the Hotel Colon - set right next to the Cathedral (not the Gaudi one!) and almost everything in walking distance. Despite New Year revellers not too noisy and almost no traffic noise.Traditional in appearance and furnishing/fittings, with comfortable beds and excellent housekeeping - both cleanliness and service. Room with small balcony, but good wardrobe, safe, TV (internet very pricey though) and lighting. Bathroom well fitted but a little tired with a need for fresh sealant and grout in places but everything worked pefectly and well cleaned. Towels, gowns etc very good.Reception is of the old school and can be almost intimidating, though everything was done correctly and as asked. Some lessons in presentation and customer contact may be of benefit to some of the staff.Food - only had breakfast - was fine (but 鈧?6 if not on package)and bar (and minibar) prices very reasonable for a European city centre hotel. Waiters variable, looked as if more management needed to organise better. Plenty of good restaurants close by so no real need to eat in hotel - Taverna de Bisbe not bad across the square.Overall quite happy and would use again at the right price - should be able to get at around 鈧?50-180.

<Content>Perfect Location in central Barcelona Good luck finding a better location for exploring central Barcelona than this. Placed just beside the Cathedral, the hotel is a perfect base for the shopping area. Within 2 minutes you find yourself in the tight cosy shoppingstreets of Barcelona. If you arrive at Plaza Catalunya, don't bother taking the subway or a taxi to the hotel, it is only a 5 minute walk from where the airport bus stops. We took the subway to the Jaime1 stop, but it is actually quicker just to walk.The hotel itself is overall a nice hotel. Not luxurious, but very comfortable. We got a room with two single beds, and asked wether they had one with a double, and without any problems the offered us one (however this was not as cosy as the first one so we decided to go for the originial one and just push the beds together). There was a tv with around 40 channels available in the room, and a mediacenter with lots of options (pay per view movies etc). Our bathroom also had a bathtub. A nice buffet breakfast was included in the room.We paid 88 euros pr.night in for our doubleroom, and will surely stay there again if we return to Barcelona.

<Content>Great experience with toddler Went to Barcelona with a 15 month old. Hotel was great with him. They had a crib all set up for him. We got a suite with the large balcony that overlooks the cathedral. I would suggest this to everyone because the few extra bucks were worth the view.It was also great for my little one to run around on. As everyone has mentioned, the location was great. Close to La Rambla but far enough away to not deal with the noise. My husband enjoyed that we were close to the Hard Rock Cafe and a Starbucks. The location was great with the Taxi drivers because no matter what they knew the word cathedral. The front desk staff were very helpful. We needed to make many phone calls because our luggage had been lost from the flight.Never ate in the restaurant(very small)but did get room service. Was not impressed with the food so just go to a close cafe outside instead. As a warning if you sit outside then food costs more. It a different menu with different prices.Overall, it was a nice experience. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Fab location and excellent hotel We have just returned from a weekend at Hotel Colon and can thoroughly recommend it. In fact this is the first time I have ever submitted a review and the hotel was so good it made us want to do it! Its centrally located for all 'sights' and easy to find - in a city where you need to find locations this is a real plus. (15 mins walk from airport bus, Bus Touristic - definitely go on and 5 mins from musuems and shops!). We did not eat an evening meal there but the breakfast was excellent and plentiful for the entire day! Room was lovely and we upgraded to a cathedral view room - well worth it.

<Content>Great Hotel with a Great Location I have just returned from Barcelona and a 2-night stay at the Hotel Colon, ending a 10-night Riviera Cruise. I had 40 happy travelers with me who all enjoyed the hotel and the wonderful location. The staff was warm, friendly and very accommodating. It was the perfect ending to a 2-week stay in Europe. The hotel was very charming, and I would certainly stay there again when in Barcelona.

<Content>The location makes this hotel We spent one night here before embarking on a cruise. Our room was small but fine for one night. The beds were not great so I wouldn't recommend a long stay. There is a great tapas bar, Bilbao Berria, on the square that you should not miss.

<Content>Fantastic Location We really enjoyed our stay at the Colon Hotel in Barcelona. We found the hotel to be charming and clean with efficient service. The daily breakfast (included with our stay) was great; eggs, bacon, sausage, cold cuts, fresh fruit, dessert selections, tea, coffee and orange juice freshly squeezed. The double bed was firm and not quite as plush as we would have chosen. Our room and towels/robes had a lavendar aroma that was a delight. Both times we requested room service (dinner one night and lunch another day) our orders were accurate and delivered in fifteen minutes or so. Dinner at the hotel's restaurant was excellent. If it hadn't been our last night, we would have dined there more. The hotel is directly across the plaza from the Cathedral, making the location in the city fantastic. Overall we were very pleased with our choice on this hotel for our stay in Barcelona.

<Content>Good hotel in a great location Big, clean room, pretty quiet. Great location as it is right on the square opposite the cathedral. We also stayed a place on the Ramblas, but the Colon was in a much better location. Less touristy and more interesting bars and restaurants around (ie ones that Spaniards went to, with better food and lower prices than those near the Ramblas!) The only thing lacking for me was that there were no tea and coffee facilities in the room - a bit annoying! However I would recommend this hotel highly.

<Content>Quality and Location! We have just returned from a 5 night stay in Barcelona at Hotel Colon and were originally drawn to consider this hotel from the reccommendation of an acquaintence who had stayed there. I followed this up by researching on Trip Advisor before booking and although most of the reviews rated it quite highly there were a few that made us a little apprehensive. Be sure not to confuse a review with the 2 Star 'Regencia' Colon Hotel which is located behind Hotel Colon itself!Comments about the excellent location of Hotel Colon are absolutely right! So perfect for exploring in every direction and in comparison to a lot of other hotels fronting noisy streets this position opposite the cathedral in a busy but relaxing square was ideal for a city location.Our room was superb - we were very fortunate to be upgraded to a large superior room in a corner position with two small balcony terraces and a jacuzzi in the bathroom. The room was clean and the air conditioning was efficient. Daily cleaning and topping up of complimentary supplies could not be faulted. Even our room service order for morning coffee arrived right on time.The hotel staff were very pleasant and professional and the porters were charming. They were more than happy to store our bags for a few hours on the day of departure and called a taxi when we were ready to go to the airport. A receipt was presented for us to use on collection of our luggage. All very efficient.One or two have commented about slow service at the outside cafe area. We expected this from reading the reviews and although we used this area 3-4 times, we did not find the wait intolerably long. A little consideration should be applied - when you are working in the heat a more measured pace is required. By contrast, if the waiting staff had been running back and forth in a scurry, the experience of relaxing in the shade at the edge of the square could well be spoiled. Even the padded cushions on the chairs added to the comfort. If there is any negative comment here, it is likely to be that some of the prices are a little expensive.Overall we would highly reccommend Hotel Colon and as a post script must say - we were a little reluctant paying so much for a hotel without a swimming pool, but in our case, the in-room jacuzzi was a better choice. After spending so many hours walking who knows how many miles each day, a few minutes in the jacuzzi was greatly appreciated and truly rejuvenating before going out for the evening, whereas a 'swim in the pool' may well have shortened the day!

<Content>Enjoyable stay at the Colon Hotel The hotel was very clean, but could use some updating (worn carpets, paint chipping). Our room faced the interior courtyard, so there was no view, but it was very quiet. The cathedral was under construction while we were there, so paying more for a room with a view would not have been worth it in my opinion. The location was fantastic. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were surprised by the 2 twin beds, but we made the best of it. The internet service was very expensive. Much cheaper to go to an internet cafe, but not as convenient. Mini-bar prices were reasonable. Overall, a great time in Barcelona!

<Content>Great hotel in a fab location My boyfriend have just come back from staying at Hotel Colon from 30 Aug to 3 Sept and loved it. The hotel is in a perfect location, in walking distance to everything, but surrounded by cafes, restaurants and bars in the Gothic Quarter. We were lucky enough to be given a room on the top floor with a large sun terrace which was total bliss. The minibar was pretty cheap by 4 star hotel standards and the breakfast was great, buffet style, although a little pricey at 15 euros per person. We would definitely return to Hotel Colon and if we could get a room with a terrace again, even better.

<Content>Great stay Hotel location was super, access to all of the main areas was easy from the cathedral square. The staff in the hotel were very attentive always helping with either requests for taxis or general tourist enquiries. I would recommend this hotel as it is central and relatively good value for money.I recommend that people who wish to get around the main attractions in Barcelona use the Bus Touristic. This has 3 routes and you can jump on and off as many times as you like. We bought the 2 day ticket which was 23 euros each but, meant that we could take our time to see the sights ( Nou camp, Sagrada familia etc).

<Content>Old school hotel in prime location My husband and I stayed here for several nights in mid-August and we really felt pampered. We had a wonderful king size room with a Cathedral view and it was just lovely. The hotel is old-school, rather than funky modern but in wonderful condition. We are seasoned travelers so we don't ordinarily ask the hotel staff for much but I frequently saw other American guests drilling the staff for all kinds of advice (I'm guessing these people don't travel much or they've been told that Barcelona is dangerous). They did give us a sheet of paper describing all the things that we (tourists) should be aware of, like pickpockets, wandering around alleys at night, 3 card monty type card tricks, etc). We saw nothing of the sort and we were out wondering and riding the metro. I'm sure this stuff happens but if you look the part, then you might be more likely to have it happen to you. In any event, the location is great, just steps from the Cathedral and the gothic quarter, which is great. And about a 20 minute walk to the waterfront and beaches. The beach areas are really cool, with lots of bars and restaurants that come alive at night. There is a great food market near the hotel (the roof looks like a multi-colored pixel screen). They did have a band playing in the plaza next to the hotel on Sat night until about 2am. It didn't really bother us because we sleep with earplugs but if you don't want the noise, you need to make sure you don't get a room facing the plaza/cathedral. They do charge for internet access which you can get directly from your tv, but it was pricey...9.50 E for a 24hour period. That also gives you access to other online benefits but we never explored those (DVDs, etc). If you are accustomed to high end hotels, this is a good one. Not the most expensive in town but comfortable and well appointed.

<Content>Excellent location, comfortable and affordable Read about it in travel guides. The location can't be beat. You can walk to the Ramblas -- much better than staying on the Ramblas (way too overcrowded and touristy). Rooms are very comfortable -- a welcome oasis in a hectic city.

<Content>Fantastic Location We stayed at the Hotel Colon for 3 nights - 29th June to 2nd July. The reception staff were all really friendly and helpful, and we were able to easily upgrade our room with no extra charge. The rooms were comfortable and clean. We were allocated a twin room with a balcony, which was at the side of the hotel, which was fine as we were able to sit out on it and people watch. The only drawback with staying at the hotel is given it's location, it can be quite noisy in the night when you're trying to sleep. I had to shut the balcony doors to get some sleep as dustbin men were emptying glass bottle banks at about 2am!! The hotel is perfectly located, right opposite the cathedral and there is always something going on in the square.There is a cafe attached to the hotel. However, if takes an eternity to get served. Cafe staff often walking past you without asking if you want anything. We sat there for 15 mins one morning before finally deciding to give up and go elsewhere. There is also a restaurant, which we ate in on our last day, which is reasonably priced and the food is good.All in all, it's really the location that makes this hotel.

<Content>Great HQ for a Barcelona vacation Like other reviews, I can't say enough about the great location of this Hotel. You are within walking distance of almost all the major sites (include Picasso Museum, Las Ramblas, etc.), though you'll need to take the metro to see Sagrada Familia. Do request a room facing the Cathedral, though, as the rooms on the side don't have the view. Helpful, English-speaking lobby staff and extremely friendly (if less English-speaking) service staff. If this is your first European hotel, just be prepared for the small rooms. Bring your own hair dryer (with an adaptor for European plugs). They've got one in the room, but it's a rinky-dink thing. They have the AC set at minimum and maximum levels, so be aware of this if you like it cold.Get tapas at the little cafe next to the Diocesan museum (across from the hotel) and coffee at the cafe down on the west end of the plaza.

<Content>Great location, helpful staff Excellent location. The staff were very helpful and friendly. As a Brit I thought the room was a reasonable size (I had a twin), clean and well appointed. Good shower power in the bathroom. I was staying on business for 2 nights and as a solo female found it quiet and secure. Has a safe in the room. I teamed up with another solo female for dinner and we found the restaurant staff very welcoming and the food good. Also plenty of choice for the breakfast.

<Content>Great location My husband and I just spent 4 nights at this hotel, May 3 -7, 2007. We had a dbl. Cathedral view room. We paid 210.00 Euro's per night. The furnishings consisted of 2 twin beds pushed together, 2 small chairs along with a side table and end table. The chairs were not comfortable so when I wanted to read I went down stairs to the lobby area and sat in their larger more comfortable chairs. We had a small balcony, I emphasize small, but it was nice to be able to look out over the square. The room was small compared to American standards but clean and comfortable. There was a TV that didn't get good reception and also intenet access. It was 9 Euros for 24 hr. use of the internet so we did that for one day. The keyboard didn't work so my husband called and they sent someone up right away to fix it. My only real complaint was the bathroom. The bathroom is small and the bidet sits right in front of the toilet. There's a very small amount of room for your legs and feet when you're sitting on the toilet. There is a restaurant on sight which we did not eat at but did sit outside and enjoyed a Sangria. The front desk staff were very nice. They do speak English. The hotel is located directly across from the Barcelona Cathedral which is covered in scaffolding. The location is wonderful. It's in the Gotic area of Barcelona so you can walk everywhere - which we did. I recommend this hotel to people who aren't going to spend much time in their room. I'm a coffee lover but found their coffee a bit strong and expensive for my taste. We were delighted to find there were 2 Starbucks within a block of the hotel.

<Content>the fabulous colon! I stayed at the Colon for a weekend in April with a friend and had a lovely experience here. We were initially given an 'internal' room which was small and claustrophobic with no view. We asked to be given a room with a balcony with more air and space and were obliged with no problem.The room were spotless and cleaned daily. The mini bar was retocked as required and not as expensive as some hotels I have stayed in. All staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was fresh, restocked regularly and tasty although I have had better breakfast in lower star hotels. The location of this hotel is fantastic particularly if you get a room with a view of the square. Noise from the square is a problem but once the windows and shutters are closed it's fine. The weather was sunny and warm when we stayed but the air conditioning system had not been switched on in the hotel. I would imagine any warmer and it would become unbearable without air con.My only negative comment really would be the 'internet connection' in the room. We tried to download our photographs onto the TV but the hotel ask for payment for this facility which I feel should be offered free.Overall a lovely hotel and I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Hotel was fantastic, good location, friendly staff, plenty for breakfast. Our room was ok, bit of a squash fitting the camp bed in as a third bed, but hey, you're only really in your room for sleeping! so it didn't really bother us. Rooms are very clean, bathroom was good size, with plenty of toiletries, clean towels everyday. Chocolates were left on your pillow, which was a nice touch.Excellent location, facing the Catherdral, which is magnificent inside, lots of scaffolding around it as currently being cleaned. Plenty of bars, cafe bars and shops around the hotel and it was nice to sit in the Catherdral Square watching the world go by. Wonderful ice cream shop not far from the hotel - give it a try!! only 5 minute walk from La Rambles, The Port and all the designer shops. We would definitely recommend and stay at the hotel again.

<Content>Wonderful Staff My husband and I spent a few nights at Hotel Colon and recommend it without reservation. Due to circumstances we could not control, we actually stayed at three different hotels within a week's span while in Barcelona. This was by far the best. The location is ideal right across from the Cathedral. The staff was even better, i.e. very helpful, very fluent in English and obviously cared about their job and their customers. We did not bring the right adapter for the wattage in Spain and they lent us one. My only complaint was the in-room internet service never worked.

The staff was friendly and the room was kept spotless. Nice bathroom as well. Beds were comfortable. Breakfast was pricey, but very good. As far as the noise level, there was no noise it was great! Will stay there again if we travel again to Europe.

<Content>Magical times at the Colon! We were a bit afraid to stay in the tourist center of Barcelon, but the Hotel Colon on the Cathedral Square of the Barrio Gotic, was wonderful. We arrived very late ( 2 a.m. ) and the staff was very helpful in advising us about parking our car in the underground garage a few feet away. ( They get half-rate prices there and gave us an in and out card ).The room was good sized, with a place for everything. Clean, pretty and the double paned windows kept it quiet. Bathroom supples always fully replaced every day.Our balcony overlooked the Cathedral Square and it was truly magical, despite the fact that scaffolding covered the front of the Cathedral for a cleaning. BUT, this was more than made up for when we had a front-row seat to watch the locals dance the Sardinera (sp?) , the lovely Catalan dance, in the square to a live orchestra on Saturday afternoon.Staff at the Colon was always helpful, and English speaking. We would go back there and recommed it highly.

<Content>Great hotel Great hotel! We stayed there for 3 nights. It has an awesome location and its a 5 min walk to Las Ramblas. The double decker bus has a stop at the stop light. The cathedral is still under renovation. The morning breakfast is excellent. The best breakfast we had during our 3 week trip to Europe! Not much more to say that hasn't already been shared. If you are traveling by train from the airport, get off on Plaza Catalunya. Its about a 10 min walk. Just ask for the cathedral and you'll find your way.

<Content>Dreadful room, good position though The hotel is in an excellent position for shops etc Our room 302 was awful - some lights not working, the old damaged furniture, awful non-matching wallpaper, old ropey bed - the room was like a prison cell and not terribly clean either. We tried to talk to the front desk about our disappointment with the room but chap not very interested.Would not recommend this hotel

<Content>Perfect Location The previously discussed benefits of the Colon's location (right next to the gothic cathedral and in the middle of the Barri Gotic (gothic quarter) make for the above-average rating and outweigh the negative of abundant street and in-hotel noise. During our three day stay the staff were extremely nice and helpful at making reservations and helping us navigate around Barcelona. Rooms were comfortable enough (beds were short, so maybe reconsider if you're over 6'2, and these aren't Park Hyatt beds or sheets) and bathroom was more than adequate for 3 of us to share.If you want to stay in the Barri Gotic, it's hard to imagine being better situated than the Colon. The noise is understandable, given the nonstop activity along the old streets, but if you're a light sleeper you should bring ear plugs.

<Content>Wonderful place to stay My younger daughter and I just returned from 10 days in Barcelona and Rome, and we spent a total of 6 nights at Hotel Colon and couldn't have been more pleased. We came to spend Christmas with my older daughter, who is studying this year at the University of Barcelona. The hotel was extremely convenient for us, since she lives just a couple blocks away. It's close to everything, and we walked everywhere or took the metro. The lobby is huge, the staff fell over themselves helping with luggage and questions, and the rooms were very spacious, especially by European standards. (I've had rooms in some of the nicer resorts in Vegas that were smaller!) The first 4 nights we had a nice double room, with a slight view of the cathedral and plaza from the little balcony. We were angled on the side, but close to the front. The cathedral is covered with scaffolding, so I didn't pay extra for a front facing room. The bathroom was large, with enormous robes, slippers and a basket full of toiletries. With the window shut, it was very quiet, but we often cracked open the window because the room was a bit on the warm side and there didn't seem to be any way to control it. We left for Rome for 3 days (stayed on Hotel Sonya, which wasn't the greatest), then returned to Barcelona and Hotel Colon for 2 more nights. The 2nd time we had an even bigger room, with a sitting area. This was more to the back, so no view. My only complaint was in this room, the bathroom lighting was pretty dismal. But I was extremely pleased with this hotel - the location, price, amenities, staff, etc, were all wonderful. I will definitely stay here again, should I return to Barcelona.

<Content>Wonderful Experience at The Colon I just returned from a week at the Hotel Colon in Barcelona and found it to be a wonderful base for someone who wants to be in the center of everything that's happening in the city. Everyone at the hotel was lovely to me and all spoke English fluently. Indeed, I arrived at the hotel very early and expected to have to stash my luggage for a few hours until a room was ready but the clerk at the front desk greeted me with a big smile and told me he had a wonderful room all ready for me. The bellman took me upstairs and showed me into a much larger than average European room which was not modern, but nonetheless excellently appointed with tradtional furnishings. However, the bathroom was totally modern with a good, powerful hair dryer, robe, slippers, etc., and there was a large flat screen TV on the desk which had wireless internet access and movies available in English. The biggest plus, however were the large french doors at the far end of the room that opened onto a tiny terrace directly overlooking the Gothic Cathedral and the Christmas market. Just gorgeous!! I was a bit concerned that the noise level from the market would keep me up at night, but with the door closed, the sound was pretty much blocked out. While I did not have dinner at the hotel, I did have coffee sent up every morning and it always came right on time and was delicious. I also made good use of the bar for coffee in the afternoon or in the evening for a nightcap and found the room itself, as well as the staff, to be lovely. Look, there are newer, hotter, trendier hotels all over Barcelona, but for the location, the price and the ambience, I think the Colon is hard to beat. I loved it and I will definitely stay there again when I return. And, I will recommend it to anyone who asks me about Barcelona.

<Content>Best Location And Best Value I stayed before and after my cruise at this hotel. It was a better choice and half the price that the cruise line was asking for pre and post stays. The hotel is across from the cathedral and in the center of all the attractions. The a/c didnt work one night and they give me another room immeaditly after calling the front desk. The hotel was very clean and the lobby had many comfortable sitting areas The rooms were fairly large by european standards. Its not worth it to pay 90 dollars more for a cathdral view and balcony when the cathdral is covered with scalfold. I would stay again the next time i am in barcelona.

<Content>Not very good. This hotel is terrible. You are better off in a hostel. It has no right to advertise as 4 or 5 star hotel. We booked almost seven months in advance and they were offering a long-stay discount at that time that gave you a 15% discount, which we secured. We just got a standard type room and our rate was about $150USD with the discount. When we checked in we were given an absolutely terrible tiny room with two twin beds, even though I requested a king. We called and asked to be moved to a room with one bed and were told we would have to wait until the next day to move. The hotel advertises that it has air conditioning in all rooms. It has a knob on the wall that looks like a thermostat control, but believe me, it doesn't work. The only way to get any air in is to open the windows or balcony. The hotel is in a very busy area and there is non-stop noise. We were literally directly above a cafe and it was ridiculously noisy. The first night we pulled the beds together away from the one wall and the paint was completely peeling off the walls and all over the floor. The bathroom was dirty looking and the room smelled bad. It was awful, but we hoped for a better new room the next day. When we went down the next day to get a new room we asked if they had anything nicer and quieter. The front desk was very helpful in showing us several different rooms. We were offered a cathedral view room for 290Euros! We looked at it and it smelled bad and was absolutely not worth it. There are much nicer hotels to be had in Barcelona for this amount. So they showed us another room that was also smallish and dirty but at least had one bed. The gentleman that showed it to us assured us it was on a quiet street that was actually closed to traffic and could only be used by the hotel behind us, which was a lie. We were told we could have the room if we hurried and moved. So we took the new room which was a slight improvement. This room also had NO air conditioing or fan to speak of. We had to keep all the winodws and the balcony door open all the time to even be able to breathe- I am not talking about keeping the room cool, I am just talking about getting enough air in that you don't roast, and this was in November! It is so loud outside 24 hours a day there is no way you can sleep. Non-stop motorcycles, scooters, shouting, banging, breaking bottles, construction, emptying of trash cans, screaming people. Even if it was quieter, there is no way you can sleep on the miserable uncomfortable beds. The bed clothes are awful and uncomfortable and it is impossible to get additional pillows. Housekeeping is almost nonexistent. They remake your bed, and that's about it. They do not replace tolietries or do much else. I understand that this is European hotel, but it is certainly not a 4-star hotel as they claim. For the price you can find a much better place in Barcelona with much better service. Most of the time if you had a request or a question you were treated with restrained disdain. When we checked out and asked for the doorman to get us a taxi he said he would call one. It was obvious he knew the driver and they were talking and lauging as they helped us get our stuff in the car. They were obviously saying things about us, but our Spanish is not great. The taxi driver then made about 3 different turn arounds on the highway, each time purposely missing the airport exits. Our cab ride ended up being more than twice as expensive as the ride from the airport to the hotel 6 days earlier! This is just one example of several of the seedy type incidents we experienced at the hotel. The location is great and Barcelona is an amazing city, so you don't want to spend much time in your room anyway, but it would have been nice to at least have a comfortable place to go back to sleep in at night. Part of our problem came from getting a cheaper rate I am sure, so they wanted to stick us with a subpar room- but they also showed us the 290 Euro room, and that was definitely not worth it at all either. I would not reccomend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Very Nice We stayed for 2 nights in Mid Nov. in a room on the top floor with a very large Verandah, which a limited view of the Cathedral (which is covered 80% with Scaffolding). Of all the staff members we came across only one did not meet the grade. The only noise we could hear was the lift going up and down as it was outside our door, but it didnt stop us from sleeping, and i am quite a light sleeper.We arrived early (11am) to drop off our bags and as the room was ready they allowed us to check in then.I agree it is in a fantastic location for exploring the entire city. I didnt eat or drink at the hotel, there are too many good restaurants and bars to explore around the city to spend your time in a hotel! I was generally very pleased with the experience.

<Content>Great hotel Just got back from a seven night stay at this lovely hotel. Location is great鈥攄irectly across from the scaffolding-draped Cathedral (bummer). Couldn't have asked for a better location. Hotel itself was very nice: staff friendly and helpful, room was fine, bathroom fine too. Had a nice little balcony overlooking an alley. Close to restaurants, subway, Placa de Catalunya, about four blocks to the right of La Rambla, stores, and in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. Will definitely stay here again when visiting Barcelona.

<Content>Great Hotel...great location...great tradition, The Sardana We stayed here for almost a week. We had a lovely room overlooking the plaza with big windows that opened facing the Cathedral. All I can say to anyone going to Barcelona is stay here if you want to really experience Barcelona...lots of good restaurants and tapas nearby, close to Ramblas without being right in the middle of that party...but most enjoyable of all was the spontaneous dancing that takes place on Saturdays and Sundays...late afternoon...go to the site below to really get a sense of what it is all about. [-]The room was large (by European standards) and well furnished with a nice bath....the staff was helpful, the cost reasonable....it is a classic hotel, not a modern soul less way station. Noise was not a problem.

<Content>Top Location, Quaint  Firstly, the Colon is not one of the designer boutique hotels that Barcelona abounds with, so if this is what you're expecting you'll be dissapointed. It's a traditional European style four star, with all of the typical facilities that you would expect - a concierge to take your luggage at the door, a well decorated lobby, a beautiful bar, and excellent room service. I stayed in a single room - definitely the biggest single I've ever experienced. The integrated TV was also a bonus as I hadn't brought my laptop, however the mouse on the keyboard was a little frustrating. The reception on the English language TV channels is also poor (and there are only news English language channels - CNN  SkyNews - I would recommend introducting at least the BBC world service). But the room was extremely comfortable (especially the bed), the bathroom was large and spotless, and the room's quaint decor was a nice oasis to retreat to. The hotel's location is of course it's real selling point. Directly opposite the Cathedral in the Venetian-style Barri Gothic, once you step out of the doors on to the square, it's obvious that you're on holidays. The Cathedral square is a fun place to people-watch, with plenty of bar terraces, and there's often live band entertainment in the evenings. This area is also a lot less seedy, safer, and more well-lit than the areas where many of the other four stars are located in Barcelona. On my return to Barcelona, I'll definitely be heading straight back to the Colon.

<Content>never again After reading the reviews I felt that hotel colon would be ideal...sadly I was wrong I have never met such rude hotel staff in all my life, the hotel room looked as old as it smelt, and I could hear every time the people next to me went to the toilet. I hated the hotel so much that the only time I spent their was to sleep鈥︹€lthough that was rarely possible due to the noise and constant building work at the hotel. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone wanting an enjoyable holiday, instead I would recommend that the staff take a course in customer service and that the hotel gets a total refurbishment

<Content>Good Hotel, Bad Soundproofing The Hotel Colon was a good choice for Barcelona, with an excellent central location opposite the cathedral, smart, professional service and good physical appearance throughout. Our 鈥榯riple deluxe鈥?room was large and spacious, with a well proportioned bathroom, complete with (heart shaped?!) Jacuzzi bath. The room also featured a modern flat screen LCD television (as all the rooms do, from what we saw) with a range of 鈥榠nteractive鈥?services like music, games, local information etc. This was a bonus, as many hotels 鈥?even ones of a similar calibre 鈥?still have woefully old fashioned television facilities (small screen bulky black-box televisions, few channels etc.) There was a fairly large selection of channels, including the usual English language suspects (Sky News, CNN, CNBC etc.). The usual four star amenities including telephone, minibar, hair dryer and air conditioning were not missing either: the air conditioning was very effective and crucially was silent as well, unlike in many hotels where it is too loud to be kept on at night and thus you don鈥檛 stay cool. The beds were hard (by American/British standards), but not uncomfortable.It was, however, a shame that the room was not very well sound-proofed even though the air conditioning was silent: there were double glazed windows and shutters, but sound from the street was not blocked out at all. Luckily the street directly outside wasn鈥檛 at all busy, but there were disturbances like deliveries, mopeds and the removal of refuse from the hotel. Also there was a pipe duct in the bathroom, so sounds from the pipes 鈥?including the drain pipes from rooms directly above 鈥?could easily be heard. The service was efficient, if not somewhat cold and business-like, but the hotel seemed equally well suited for business and leisure visitors. The breakfast buffet was good but not exceptional. Overall, this hotel wasn鈥檛 perfect but is still a good choice in a great location.

<Content>Great Stay Yes, the cathedral is still covered in scaffolding. Luckily we didn't pay for the cathedral view. This is a great hotel with friendly staff. Room was very clean and well furnished. Bathroom is large - and I still don't understand these European hairdryers. (If you have longer hair they take forever to get your hair dry.) No view from the back side of the hotel. Great Breakfast. Would stay again.

<Content>Loved It! Just returned from spending 4 nights at Hotel Colon with friends and we were all very impressed with the hotel. The location is great, handy for walking to the sights and very close to a stop for the tourist bus.The rooms were clean and comfortable. We did not have ones directly facing the cathedral but could see it from the balcony. OK so it was covered in scaffolding but this did not spoil it for me - it's nice to see old buildings being maintained rather than being left to decay. The air conditioning in the room was excellent - powerful and very quiet - which is just as well as the weather was scorching!The front desk staff were very helpful and friendly. They all spoke excellent English and were happy to answer questions.Definetly recommended.

<Content>Great Hotel Having read many varying reviews on many different hotels across Barcelona I wasslightly disheartened and concerned about which to book. However, I decided uponthe 4* Hotel Colon in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. I was very impressed withthis hotel and would definitely stay there again if I was returning to the city.It is very central indeed, being a 5 mins walk from Las Ramblas and from themetro station, should you wish to travel slightly further afield. The staff werevery helpful, the rooms were kept very clean, being made up each day withoutfail. The only two very minor complaints I would have would be that you may findyourself waiting at the Reception desk a while as they do tend to answer andstay on the phone, even if you are mid conversation. The other being that themini bar was not always re-stocked every day. Our room did not have a facing view of the cathedral but this did not bother usat all (particularly as it is currently covered in scaffolding), it did howeverhave a small balcony. The area can be quite noisy but you would never be able totell once you have shut the doors to the balcony. They are fully double glazedand keep out all noise. The efficient air conditioning system makes itunnecessary to open these during the night anyway. The bathroom was wellequipped with toiletries etc. plus dressing gowns/matching slippers and a greatpower shower.It was slightly expensive at 脗拢120 per room per night but well worth it for thecomfort and the location. I would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Ideal location My wife and I have just spent 3 nights at the Colon Hotel. We found it to be in an ideal location close to Las Ramblas and the Port. The bus tours are close at hand and all the sights in easy reach. The hotel itself was superb with friendly staff and clean and well proportioned rooms. Our only criticism was no tea or coffee making facilities. However we would definately recommend this hotel and use it again for a return visit.

<Content>Great location -- but the view of scaffolding was a bummer Like one of the other reviewers, I booked a room with a terrace overlooking the cathedral, only to find that the cathedral was hidden by scaffolding and netting. My husband and I just started laughing as the driver pulled up, because it was only fitting of our whole trip through Spain -- apparently their having some work done, as the whole country seemed to be under construction. Especially Seville and Granada. Although we were still happy with our room here, clean and bright, it would be best to wait until the church is finished to gain the full benefits. We did have a nightly concert in the square however, and the Gothic Quarter (where the hotel is located) is the most fun to walk around. Especially the El Born neighborhood which is filled with cute tapas bars. Stay away from Las Ramblas, though, it's like Disneyland. And the side streets off of it are sketchy. Hookers out at 7 PM.

<Content>Stayed 26 to 28 April - Supurb We stayed in this hotel as it received the best reviews, for this level of hotel, and had a lack of noise at night comments. It delivered on all accounts. We stayed on the Gastronomic stay offer - 2 nights BB with dinner on one night for 鈧?99 each. It works out at about 拢40 more than room only but the breakfast is very good and varied and the dinner - a tasting menu so you get 7 courses but some are just a mouthful! which is very well presented and has been prepared to a high standard, in fact it is better than a lot of 5* food I have experienced.Room wise - we had room 414 which was being used to trial a fully interactive LCD TV with Internet, games etc. which was nice as you could check look up guides on the net for free! The room, although being on the side of the hotel, has a balcony so you can stand on that and look at the cathedral - which is covered in scaffolding!Staff were friendly and doormen deserve a mention as genuinely taking an interest in you and not just holding out for a 鈧? tip!Barcelona ia a great place, didn't feel threatened/at risk form pickpockets etc. Like all major cities, it's the luck of the draw where crime is concerned. If you don't go to dodgy areas then you should be ok.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, I would highly reccomend it. We stayed here over the Easter period and found it a wonderful hotel. The staff were extrememly courteous and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for them.We had booked a room with a terrace and cathedral view and we were not disappointed even though the cathedral is covered in scaffolding. I was aware of this before we went anyway. Great fun watching all that was going on in the square frome a 'birds eye' view!  and well worth the extra money.Barcelona is a lovely city and you can walk for miles just looking at things. Unfortunately when we tried to visit the Picasso Museum (twice) the queus were so long and were likely to tack a good hour to clear so we didn't get in. The harbour area is a great place to people watch.

<Content>Advertised cathedral view is in fact scaffolding. Stayed 4 nights, prebooked, paying premium charge for room with Cathedral View. Hotel facilities and service are fine, and the view over the plaza in front of the cathedral is lively and interesting. However, the cathedral itself is covered in scaffolding, with only the spire being actually visible! Since there is a hefty premium charge, specifically for the Cathedral View, I think it is less than honest of the hotel to advertise their rooms in this way without at least a cautionary mention of the fact that the cathedral is almost totally obscured by scaffolding. After I paid at check-out, I mentioned this to the counter staff, but they shrugged my comments off, clearly believing this not to be their problem.I would think the scaffolding will the there for months, if not years.

<Content>Charming hotel, brilliant location I've just returned from my first visit to Barcelona and two nights at the Hotel Colon. It's a great place - I would definitely stay there again.The hotel is one of the oldest and best known in the city - not quite a grand old palace but charming, comfortable and old-fashioned (in a good way). The staff are delightful and very helpful. My room was cosy (and not too small, especially by European standards) and had all the usual mod cons such as mini-bar, hair dryer and TV with English language channels. The decor is not for everyone - rather old style with flowered wallpaper and ruffled bed covers (so not ideal for a Barcelona stag weekend - which is perhaps a bonus...) but if you like slightly shabby chic you'll be in heaven. The bathroom was spotless and came complete with fluffy white dressing gown and slippers, as well as a stack of soft towels and bath goodies. The bathroom fittings are slightly outdated - perhaps installed in the 1970s - but its probably a matter of personal opinion... I thought it was charming and added to the hotels distinctiveness. Definitely not an anonymous box!If you want everything to be absolutely up to date this may not be for you - but then you'll also spend much more. I had a special winter rate of 75 Euros for a large single and was very happy.

It has comfy beds, great warm water pressure  is very clean. Bathrooms are very modern by European standards with lots of extra products. The staff was friendly  helpful when needed. I give them an A+

<Content>Excellent Hotel My husband and I recently traveled to Barcelona and stayed at the Hotel Colon. The location is excellent...near Metro as well as all the major sites. The front desk staff was extremely helpful and professional and spoke perfect English. The room was comfortable and not claustrophobic...always hot water and good pressure in the shower. The balcony provides a great view of the cathedral and non-stop activity. The room was surprisingly quiet at night! Breakfast is awesome and is served til 11AM, which is great after a late night out on the town. We both felt very safe walking to the hotel at night and the front desk was always staffed. I would, without hesitation, recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona.

<Content>Colon worth it! Really liked this hotel. Location directly opposite the Cathedral was great, although it is still covered in scaffold for renovation. The Barri Gothic area is a good spot. The room was quiet, given it's location, the sounds from the square in the evening through open doors were delightful. Breakfast was also very good, if you can't find something to eat I'd be shocked. The front of house staff recommended, and booked, a flamenco show and dinner, at Cordobes, only minutes away, and it was worth it. Although don't eat the stew, my husband got food poisoning. A good place that I would recommend, and return to. Room 109.

<Content>Good hotel, Great location We were moved from the Regencia Colon to the Colon due to a lack of rooms at the former hotel. We found the hotel to be elegant in the public rooms. Well decorated, spacious, comfortable with a number of sofas and club chairs and an adjacent bar that was also very nice. They also have outdoor patio seating on the plaza where you can enjoy drinks while watching the passing strollers. The room was neat and clean but modest in style. The bathroom was reasonable size with all the goodies and hair dryer. The A/C worked great. We had use of plush terry robes which was nice. The room was very quiet, had roll shutters to cover the window and keep out noise. Not sure the room quality was worth the money charged by the Colon but well worth it to us since we were paying the Regencia rate. Location is wonderful. In Barri Gotic close to everything. Staff friendly and well versed in English.

<Content>The Colon needs a Colonic Well, let's see...the first room they placed me in had paint falling from the ceiling due to a water leak. I awoke in the next room to the sound of banging and drilling due to construction of a new hotel next door (right next door). I was finally dragged to a third room but NO ONE (front desk staff) acted liked they cared. I complained to the manager and she did comp my daily breakfast (which I thought was free anyway since they don't give you a bill in the breakfast room...you just sign your name and room # on a slip). All in all I don't think I was treated with much respect and courtesy at this hotel; it would not have taken much for the management to show a bit of concern. I came away with a very bad opinion of it, although it IS in an excellent location. BTW, the cathedral is still draped so don't bother with the rooms that overlook it.

<Content>Great Location The hotel itself has a great location. The rooms are on the small side, but that is normal for Europe. The rooms are well-kept and cleaned everyday, saw the maid ourselves a few times. The hotel staff are helpful enough. We were given a better room without being charged for it, (quite a few room tours before we got to the right one). They also recommended a tour company to drive us out of town and we were quite happy with the service. I recommend this hotel for its great location and accessibility to everything.

<Content>A step away... I found the reception staff most helpful and efficient but I do wonder how much commission is on offer for arranging tickets for the bullfight (for my parnter, not for me...) and the flamenco/dinner show (which was excellent by the way). Perhaps I am being just a tad cynical? The location is excellent (but a map on offer at check-in would have been appreciated) and is an easy walk both to La Ramblas and to the warren of streets that make up the Barri Gothic. Also close to the square where you catch the City Tour buses without whom many of the tourist attractions of the city would be less accessible. Our big corner room was excellent with two sets of french doors to two small (not sit on) balconies and a bathroom with two sinks and ever replenished supplies of products including toothbrushes and razors. Also, the cleanliness of the room (and of the hotel itself) was very good. (The excellent double glazing of the french doors was much appreciated given that there is building work next to the hotel. I certainly wouldn't let that put you off.) Having travelled to Barcelona from Girona where I stayed in a very good (but characterless) 4**** modern hotel I found the faded granduer of Hotel Colon rather welcome and comforting.

<Content>Great hotel In 2000 I made a pledge to stay in this hotel because of its location. We arrived early on a Friday afternoon after a all night flight with a five hour lay over in Madrid. The hotel staff was welcoming. Our room was ready and exactly what we had asked for and our three day stay was wonderful. This hotel is all about location. Across from the cathedral and on the edge of the Rambles. We loved it. We could walk everywhere. Our last night, behind the cathedral was a man singing opera. Imagine, a full moon night, Barcelona and a great tenor. It was a visit to remember and the Hotel Colon was the perfect place to stay.

<Content>Barcelona, City of Columbus HOTEL COLON BARCELONA, Avenida Catedral, 708002,Barcelona.We arrived at the hotel early afternoon after our flight from Newcastle-upon-Tyne by Easyjet. The journey from the airport being by airport bus(very cheap, and not too crowded) to Catalunya Square, only five minutes walk from the hotel.When we checked in, we were shown to a room which only had a window looking into a lightwell, so, as it was our 35th Wedding Anniversary the following Monday, we decided to upgrade to a room with a balcony overlooking the Cathedral Square. The extra cost was worth it, as that weekend Pope John Paul II died, and the singing of the faithful, waiting to enter the Cathedral to pray, whilst sorrowful, was most moving.The hotel staff were most attentive, speaking excellent English, and were a fount of advice on the attractions of the city.The weather that weekend was a mix of warm, but windy days, and cool nights.The city tours were good value, particularly a second day for only 4鈧?extra, enabling us to select where we wanted to get off for a more in-depth visit at our own pace, (we are in our fifties, the mind still thinking as we did twenty years ago, but the body is tiring), especially the Familia Sagrada Cathedral, Goudi's House and Park, and the football stadium with all those trophies that would put English clubs' trophy rooms to shame.The column commemorating the discoveries of Columbus was a good visit, even if the elevator was crowded with only four plus the operator. The view over the city was excellent at dusk, with the sun setting behind the hills above the city.Overall, the city visit was good value, and would be considered for a visit in the future, after other cities on our list have been visited

<Content>Great Location-too expensive We just returned from Barcelona with our two children, ages 14 and 20. As many reviews have stated, the location is wonderful. But, unfortunately, I did not use an on-line booking service but paid top dollar and I was amazed at how little was provided for this price. Breakfast was not included, there was no coffee available in the morning and there was very little interest in providing information about the area. We booked a suite which was adequate for 4 people but had only one bathroom. We were charged $38 extra a night for the 4th person. In all, I would not stay there again for this kind of money. We paid $298/euros a night plus the $38 extra for my daughter - Way too much money. And the cathedral is under renovation which is not too attractive - not the hotel's fault. But, there was a huge flea market in the plaza out front which was never mentioned. We were there on Palm Sunday and there were wonderful festivities right on the plaza but the hotel staff never mentioned anyhting about these things. So, I'd rather walk a few more blocks, save a huge amount of money, and get a few more amenities next time.

<Content>OK but not great The staff is wonderful and the hotel itself beautiful, it's location tends to be quite noisy especially on the weekends. It is centrally located to everything and along with that comes everyone wanting to be centrally located. Keep in mind Spain does not really start waking up until 8pm. Be prepared. The rooms were always clean as well as the baths. Both are spacious.

<Content>Watch out for building work Hotel currently undergoing an upgrade which means that there are builders and decorators on the premises from 8am. Also, there is extensive building work going on outside (it's next to a building site) which means between 8am and 7pm you can hear pneumatic drills and colorful language!Staff were not particularly helpful and the whole place is in dire need of a clean up. Would not stay there again.

<Content>STAR RATING IN SPAIN IS 3 STARS TOO HIGH I didn't think that the hotel was THAT great. They upgraded us to a Cathedral View room with a large balcony (larger than the bathroom and bedroom combined) on the top floor but I wasn't impressed. For the rating that the hotel has and the price I wasn't expecting: puke/avocado green kitch wallpaper and bed cover that hasn't been washed for a while, spotted carpet, A/C that was working when you turned on the heat, an outdated bathroom with kitchen motif tiles and plastic $1.99 patio furniture. The staff seamed like we had to been service oriented towards them instead the other way around with few exceptions like our bell boy and one lady at the front desk. My husband loved the view of the cathedral and didn't mind the gas company's sign since it covered a part that was being restored. He enjoyed the music and dancing that took place in the plaza up front.  The location was great, we could walk to las Ramblas or anywhere else, where you can take the matro to the rest of the city. This was the 1st time I stayed in a hotel in Barcelona, so I am not sure how good or expensive are others with the same star rating.

<Content>Good, but overstated elegance The Colon has such a great location. Just across the square from the Cathedral in the Gothic Quarter. A Cathdral View room lets you watch the traditional dancing on a Sunday afternoon and watch the busy stall holders when they hold the antique market. Our Cathedral View was based upon hanging out the window and stretching your neck akwardly. We stayed here after a previous visit to it's less illustrious sibling, the Regencia Colon.It's a good clean hotel, but it's virtues are well overstated, and it's reputation, together with Barcelona's popularity, ensures it's expensive, even though it's rooms are smaller than many others in Barcelona. It's in the middle of everything though and very close to Ramblas and several Metro stations that can take you anywhere in the city. The concierge knows where the best restaurants are, and his advice is invaluable, even to a seasoned traveller to Barca, though the rest of the staff are a bit laissez-faire. While we were there, there were some MTV producers at the hotel, and we seemed to just get in the way of the hotel staff looking after these more important guests.It will cost you more to stay at this 4 star hotel than at many of Barca's 5 star hotels, but you get individually designed rooms, with real furniture, rather than corporate hotel fitted furniture, and you won't be splashing out on taxis to get around to the nightspots either as most are in walking distance.I would recommend it for one stay in the city as it is as synonymous with Barcelona as is La Sagrada Familia, Gaudi or a cold glass of Estrella Damm beer. But there are much better places to go back to stay at; it isn't worth it to stay here just to save a taxi fare back to a hotel which is further afield.

<Content>disappointing... not particularly friendly staff refused to provide us with the double bed we requested, even though such rooms were available. they demanded an extra 25 euros to provide us with a room with a double bed. while the bathrooms were new and very clean, the room itself was starting to look quite shabby - stained carpets etc. I had thought we had a bargain at the price we paid (around 170 euros/night), but if anything I would say that is a little expensive for the quality of the service and rooms.

<Content>Location Location Location Fantastic location opposite cathedral in central Barcelona. Great place to stay with excellent tapas bars locally and Les Ramblas and Placa del Catalunya a brief stroll away. Just one problem - we had requested a Cathedral view but found ourselves in a basic room at the back of the building overlooking a building site. Don't know if that was the fault of the hotel or the 3rd party who handled our booking

<Content>Beautiful hotel and location, but, what a racket in the morning !!!!! Stayed at this hotel for three nights 16-19 nov 2004. Thought the hotel was fantastic and in a beautiful and very central location.Lovely clean rooms and comfy beds, and the staff were very helpful, nothing was ever a problem. Unfortunately everything has to have a down side, and on this occasion it was the location of our rooms. We had two basic twin rooms, These rooms are situated at the rear of the hotel. You will notice the volume of noise that comes into the room from the little street that runs underneath these rooms. It was basically due to roadworks just around the corner off the hotel, but also you hear such things as the binmen coming around at about seven in the morning. This may be remedied if you ask for a higher floor than ours, as we were on the first. But this wouldn't have been a problem if you sleep with your windows shut. Please don't let this last piece put you off, i've stayed in many hotels all around the world and i found this hotel a very friendly place to stay.I would have no doubt at all, that on my return to Barcelona i will be staying here again. HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME !!!!!

<Content>nice rooms, great staff We stayed at the Colon at the beginning of October, 2004. Our room was large, clean and comfortable with lots of closet space. We had friends travelling with us and their room was smaller but had hardwood floors and extra door between the bedroom area and the door to the corridor. We looked out on a side street and had no problem with noise on a Friday night but left on a Saturday morning. The staff was extremely helpful in recommending restaurants and giving information on museums, exhibits and other sights. When they didn't know something they were more than willing to call around until they found an answer. The breakfast was acceptable if not lavish; our only complaint was a large, foul-mouthed and obnoxious group from New Jersey and we won't blame the hotel for that!

<Content>'Cathedral' View was an ad for the Gas Company As a special treat to ourselves, we decided to splurge on a cathedral view room. The view required leaning out the window; and the cathedral was enveloped in a huge advertisement for a gas company.The room was nice --bathrobes, comfortable bed, cable TV, in-room safe-- but it should have been for the price, even through the travel sites, we were paying. And we found many of staff incredibly snobbish: trying to get metro directions was impossible -- But, of course, you will take a taxi.I don't regret our stay at the Colon -- it is a lovely building with a lot of history: one visit was nice; however, I would not stay there again.

<Content>Great Room and Great Price! Hotel Colon was wonderful. My husband and I purchased our tickets from their website and ended up with a great room with a nice little balcony. We were there during August! Our room window did not face the cathedral but if you went out onto the balcony you could easily see it. The cathedral is covered with a cloth right now since it is under restoration so facing the cathedral isn't worth the extra money. The location is perfect! You can get to anywhere by foot and the square in front of the hotel is a lot of fun to walk! We were very satisfied with this hotel!

<Content>I'd stay here again! We were in Barcelona during mid-June. This was our first time in Barcelona, and we love it. The Colon Hotel has a wonderful location. My husband and I thought our room was lovely with a balcony facing a quiet and quaint street that was not facing the catherdral but was still very nice. Our room was clean and the bathroom was spacious. The bed was a little different then my idea of a Queen bed ( two beds pushed together) but we laughed it off and managed. I felt the staff was very professional and courteous. We had no problems with reservations: checking in or out. I was very happy with our accomodations . I would not hesitate to stay at Hotel Colon again. By the by..the Four Cats is a fun and lively restaurant with excellent food and a very close walk from Hotel Colon.

<Content>Don't Trust Them Don't believe everything the staff tells you in advance of your visit. I wrote to ask if they had down or feather pillows and said if they didn't I would bring my own; they wrote a nice note back assuring me that they could provide down pillows. When I arrived I found hard rubber pillows, which are painful to my neck and impossible for me to sleep with. They denied any knowledge of my email and asked if I had brought with me a copy of their reply as proof. I told them I didn't because it had never occurred to me to doubt their word. I now know better. They were quite nasty about the issue. They were also less than helpful in providing information about local tours. Some of the staff is nice but some are quite unpleasant.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel in a very special location We had a fantastic time in Barcelona and the Hotel Colon made a very special base. We had a lovely room at the side of the hotel, (we could see the cathederal from the balcony), good, spotless facilities - big bed, bathroom, wardrobes etc. Very friendly staff, no problems with our pre-paid booking with Expedia. Very central location. Would definately go to Barcelona again and definately stay at the Hotel Colon.

<Content>Great place to stay in Barcelona! We loved this hotel because it had so much charm and the view from our room was fantastic, facing the cathedral. The rooms are very comfortable. The location is fantastic. The staff were pleasant. I would however recommend a room facing the cathedral as that is what made the stay so special.
