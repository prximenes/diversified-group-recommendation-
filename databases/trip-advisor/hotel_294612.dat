<Content>Hmmm, there's better out there. We stayed at the Vulcan Hotel in September 2008. We just heading to Sydney for a Shopping/Party night (6am flight out Saturday morning, 6am flight home Sunday morning), so the room was just used as a home base and a place to keep our stuff and to get ready in. Found it the night before on a search website, looked decent from the pictures, called them up and they offered a $5 discount per night...Price:We paid $125 for the night. Breakfast/Dining/Bar:I didn't bother, but some of the other guys had a drink at the bar and it was very limited. There was NO MINIBAR in your rooms, just a bottle of water. There was a fridge downstairs which you were provided with a key to get more refreshments out, but not sure how it charged..?Location:It was in a very unknown and industrial area. Nothing closeby except a petrol station. I think it took us half an hour to get back to anywhere decent (the ground was sloped too so very uncomfortable walk, probably should have worn better shoes though!). One cabbie (for some reason didn't have a GPS) got lost and pulled over in Darling Harbour and expected us to get out and walk our way back in the dark without knowing where we were going...Noise, etc:Not sure, wasn't in the room all that much.Other Travellers:As aboveRooms:Rooms were decent sized. No luggage stand though and the lighting in the bedroom was very very dim. You have to hog the bathroom to do your makeup and put your stuff either on the floor or on top of the toilet lid (eww). The bathroom was very small and the water goes absolutely everywhere. Our air conditioning was jammed but we managed to unjam it... The bedding was itchy for the couple of hours we did sleep. I was very tired though so I could have slept on a rock.View:We couldn't open the windows, they were glued shut, except 1, and it didn't open far. We had nothing to look at except a street.Check In / Out:We checked in earlier, but the room was ready for us which was fantastic. As we left the hotel at 5am and reception was closed they just advised us to leave the key in the roomCabs:MUST CALL IN ADVANCE!They occasionally come past the main street but no way guaranteed.Security:As there is no one at reception at all, you enter via a seperate door with a key to get into the building. The whole hotel used traditional keys rather then the magnetic swipe card which gets recoded each time. I wouldn't say it was very secure due to 'normal' keys. Only 1 set was provided which was annoying.Overall Experience:We were only there for 1 night, and slept for a couple of hours, but we should have definately booked somewhere closer. I guess these were only small annoying things, but I've stayed at cheaper places in Sydney CBD with better locations.I would not call this a botique hotel.

<Content>A Basic Hotel 20 mins walk from Darling Harbour The Vulcan is not in a very nice area and there is no where around the Hotel to have a stroll in the evenings. Darling Harbour is a good 20 minute walk, 1st past the Power House Museum then Paddy's Market monorail station, and then still a good walk after that. I agree about the outside space at the Hotel - if it rains it's un- useable - sofas were wet through. Also only one door was usually open to it, and that was around the other side to where our room was.Room was small, and the 1st night the air conditioning was noisy and kept us awake all night.The bar was not inviting, and we weren't even tempted by the food on offer.However, we almost got used to it and enjoyed exploring Paddy's Market, Chinatown etc. from the Hotel, and also used the Monorail from Paddys Market station. You have to walk a way for a bottle shop, so that you can at least have a drink in your room!!!! Recommend Hannah's Pies on the way to station. The price is reasonable, but I wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Never again The hotel seemed pleasant enough until my partner and I reached the room. We had requested a non-smoking room. The room smelt of smoke, it was even in the sheets and blankets. There were no toiletries when we first entered the room.We had to leave the hotel soon after checking in. Before we did we went to the front desk to ask them to spray the room as the smoke smell was rather strong.We returned to the hotel just before 10pm. Our room key did not open the guest entrance. When we got to our room again all they had done was open a window. They had put soap and shampoo in the bathroom but no toilet paper. There was no phone numbers for us to request some. The web site stated there was a mini bar. It was in hall way and you had to have a smart key from reception but by this time it was closed.The bed was on wheels and would move ever time you rolled over in bed.Every time someone flushed the toilet or had a shower you could hear it through the walls.House keeping woke us up at 7.30am the next morning. At 8am they decided to enter our room even thought we had requested a late check out.

<Content>Very disappointing stay Overall, my stay was rather disappointing, and very different from what was at the hotel's website:1.Room not made up when checking in2. Airconditioning failed hence couldn't sleep as it was freezing; though I have to commend the prompt response of the staff when told next morning3. Cold room and atmosphere, more a budget accomodation than boutique hotel4. Towels not delivered to room though requested for and promised5. Receptionist rude and sacastic6. Did not charge prices as agreed7. Not that near to Darling Harbour. It's at least a good 20 mins walk to Darling Harbour.8. In the middle of an industrial estate hence very quiet at night and weekends.9. Not near food places or convenience stores.

<Content>Vulcan Website is Misleading I found this hotel online and booked directly with the hotel based on the pictures and description of the hotel on their website.When we arrived at the hotel I sat for a good 30 seconds inside the taxi, not wanting to get out because there was no recognition of the hotel from the photos I had seen on the internet.The hotel is drab, the furnishings are cheap, the rooms are cramped and the atmosphere is unpleasant. All of this would be ok, if we A) had expected the conditions to be poor and B) the price reflected the conditions. The hotel is barely more than a backpackers in terms of the comforts provided and should not be marketed as a boutique motel.

<Content>Really Chic - Loved it! Just stayed at The Vulcan Hotel last weekend. Had a great time in Sydney as I always do. The hotel is very fashionable and very hip! The rooms are great and new all the things I would expect with a boutique hotel nice decor and it gives you this great feeling as soon as you enter the place. Staff are great and very helpful and really personal service, like the good old days.

<Content>Robbery I had over $1500 worth of property stolen from my room in the middle of the night ... I wasn't the only one either! Numerous rooms were robbed.I would never stay there ever again i would never recommend this hotel to anyone and i still have no idea where my property is the hotel didn't help a bit.They blamed me for it and somehow didn't know how to check the security camera tapes! Mystery! The rooms are lock and key so there is no trace of how the apparent robber got in.The hotel out of goodwill offered me $100.The room was great but after the extremely bad service i recieved .....All i can do is warn you if you do stay there LOCK EVERYTHING AWAY!! Oh and there isn't a safe anyway!It may be cheap but trust me having to replace house keys,car keys,work keys, all your bank cards, reading glasses, precious jewellery... having you plane tickets stolen and finding out 1/2 an hour before your flight .. IS NOT WORTH IT!!! I would much rather pay $50 more anywhere else but the VULCAN!

<Content>Good Choice Not so young traveller.... Scarborough England. I arrived late in the evening after a very long day, the night porter booked me into my room very quickly, which was very clean and tidy. Throughout my 3 day stay I found the staff very helpful and friendly, If I ever visit Sydney again it will certainly be my hotel of choice.

<Content>Dont expect to much We stayed at the Vulcan for 2 days in Feb this year, we had viewed the photos on its website, which I must say are very misleading and the description of a boutique hotel within easy access to darling harbour is a bit ambitiousThis is a very old building that has been refurbed on the cheap. the rooms are small and cold with corrugated steel ceilings our parents room had damp up the walls, the blankets were scratchy and the carpets are threadbare, the location is in the middle of a very busy industrial area, our room overlooked a classroom full of children, and it is a very unpleasant 20 min walk to Darling Harbour, and it was the kind of hotel that you wanted to spend as little time in as possible as it had a cold empty atmosphere.This is a hotel that is best suited for people who just want a bed for the night, definatley not recommended for families.

<Content>Highly recommend Simple Hotel, all you need when you're 10-15 minutes walk from Darling Harbour. Gather building work in 2006 caused bad reviews. Helpful staff and Carole, the owner, was particularly friendly to everyone. Only fault to find, the sheets should have been changed at shorter intervals.

<Content>Handy location We booked a standard double for a 2 night stay, $139 AUD per night which was probably a bit much for what it was. A pub in a former life, the room was small, but the bed was queen size and very comfy. Opening windows were double glazed, bathroom new with shower over bath, exhaust fan didn't seem to do much. A/C unit in wall, not through window, so very quiet operation, remote controlled. Small fridge, tea and coffee making in room. There is a lift now. Didn't feel unsafe to walk around after dark, 5-10 min walk to Haymarket, i.e. Paddy's market, monorail and light rail station, Chinatown, bit further same direction to the Spanish Quarter, bit further still to Darling Harbour. Didn't eat on site, but nice meal at the Chinese place round in Mary Ann st, don't let the look put you off, the food was excellent. Food court above Paddy's Market good for $7 breakfast.If you just want somewhere to put your head for the night, this place isn't bad, handy to lots of places and very quiet when we were there. Non-smoking indoors, there is a central courtyard for smokers, which is decked out with comfy outdoor furniture.

<Content>Very nice and charming.... I can honestly not think of anything negative to say about this hotel. It is most definately the best value for money I have ever seen in any hotel, and probably even the best hotel I have ever stayed at. For the prize I payed I didn't expect much, but I was in every way positively surprised. The staff was very professional, helpful and friendly. My room was spacious, clean and stylish. They had wireless internet available in my room (for some extra dollars per day), which worked fast and reliably. Even though my room was facing the road in front of the hotel, there was no noise whatsoever in my room (the windows are effectively blocking any outside noise, but the traffic outside was anyway not very dense or loud). The AC was modern and silent. The breakfast room was bright and clean, and the food was excellent.

<Content>Never, ever again. Thought I was in luck when I reached the Hotel because they could check me in straight away at 9am as opposed to 2pm and I really, really needed sleep. I had however expected to find the room to the same standard I would have had I checked in at 2pm. But then again, judging by my experiences over the 5 days, perhaps I had found it the same.If I hadn't already paid in full, I would have left and found another hotel immediately.It was so not like on the website. The room was the size of my master bedroom/study here at home. That includes the bathroom. No welcome kit (you know with the phone numbers and paper and pen and maps etc). It smelt unbearably of cigarette smoke, the blanket had stains on it and the wall had hand smear marks. I think I cried. There wasn't even a shower curtain. When I queried this later thinking they may have just forgotten to put one up, I believe I was told that's how they clean the bathroom. I thought they were joking but they never did put a curtain up. Water EVERYWHERE every time I took a shower. I'm surprised I didn't electrocute myself. Oh and talking about safety? I realised on the last day that the fire evacuation poster on the back of the door was for a different room than mine.There were little cards to place in the bathroom and on the bed indicating when you'd like the towels and/or sheets changed. I had however expected the bed to be made even if the sheets weren't changed. I also found on at least one occasion that the maid had entered the room when I hadn't put the sign on the door. It was the day I hadn't locked all my bits and pieces in the suitcase so I wasn't particularly happy with this.The soundproofed windows aren't too bad but the walls are thin so if you have tv watching neighbours invest in some good ear plugs.I found that on the rare occasions the reception staff actually acknowledged me entering or leaving the hotel they were either disinterested or cheeky/sarcastic and quite unhelpful. This was not the way I wanted to be treated when travelling alone. It's hard enough being in a strange place without the place you're staying being a nightmare.I have nicer facilities at home for a third of the price per night . Maybe next time I plan a holiday I'll stay home!

<Content>Comfort and value at the Vulcan I moved to the Vulcan after a bad experience at Pensione Hotel. The staff at the Vulcan were helpful, holding a room for me while i negotiated my way out of Pensione (which was really lousy). The room was large and peaceful with comfortable minimalist furnishings, a discreet little kitchenette and a large sunny balcony with furniture. If you hate aircon as I do, you can sleep with the doors wide open. The facade is heritage but the rooms have been substantially rebuilt. The hotel is slightly off the main drag, but only a couple of minutes walk from the monorail stop and Powerhouse Museum. There were good Malaysian resturants on the same block, and 5 minutes to Chinatown. It was extremely good value for $A110,

<Content>Very disappointed with the service I booked a premium double room for one week. When I arrived, it was very hot and humid in Sydney. I checked into my room around 2:00 pm on a Sunday and told the desk clerk the air conditioning wasn't working in my room. She didn't have another premium room for the price I paid. She showed me a regular room with two twin beds that was lower priced than my room and said I could change but would have to pay the same price. She also suggested she give me a humidifier to cool the room until the maintenance crews could check out the air conditioner on Monday. The twin room was too small for 2 people so I chose the humidifier. It didn't cool the room at all and I was miserably hot all night. The next morning I asked for some ice for the humidifier so I could cool the room enough to shower. The desk clerk said I could go to the Shell station across the street and buy some. Another desk clerk suggested I pay $30 more a night for an upgraded room. Since I was so hot and miserable I said ok and that I would speak to a manager about the rate.I spoke to the manager and told him I didn't think it was fair that they charge me more for an upgraded room when the premium room I booked was not available. He didn't agree and charged my credit card.The rooms are small and clean in this hotel. However, don't expect good service or special treatment. The superior room we eventually received was large and new but I think you can find a better location and hotel for the price. The hotel says its in Darling Harbour however, it is a 15 minute walk to the Harbour. I would not recommend staying in this hotel if you can afford something a little nicer.

<Content>Great Value Great Location I found this hotel on a recent trip to Oz, it is a boutique hotel on Wattle Street, only 15 min walk to Darling Harbour. The hotel was clean at at such reasonable rates AU$99.00 per night was great value. The staff were friendly and my room although small was clean and comfortable with AC TV and fridge.

<Content>Good little hotel for its price Good value, considering Sydney hotel prices. Stayed there in early Feb'07 for a work thing. Location is good, just at the fringe of the city, walking distance (20mins) to Sydney offices. Room is simple and bare, with exteme minimalist look. Sheets and blankets are rough and itchy, so if you are the sensitive type, bring either your own sheets or a sleeping bag. Checked in after hours, so was a little disappointed by the staff service. My first time in the hotel and was unsure where to go or where the room was. The staff just pointed and said just go around and the lift is there.Fire alarms went off twice early next morning. I evacuated the first time, but everyone was confused as no one provided any instructions or updates. We all just stood around the street front and wondered what was happening. People just started going back in when the fire trucks left. Second time it went off, I was in the shower and just couldn't be bothered anymore.Considering the price you pay, but I will seriously consider paying a little more for a better hotel next time.

<Content>Nice little place Having just stayed at Vulcan Hotel for New Years Eve I found the place to be a nice place. Rooms were clean and comfortable. We had to stay 4 night as this was the minmum stay and the rate was quite high but i guess Sydney is at this time of year. It looks like the renovations have finished and the place looks very new.

<Content>For the price, pretty good deal and location Booked on wotif.com around 3 weeks before my arrival. Got a $89 AUS rate for a single room. Pros:Good rate for a room with a jacuzzi tub. My friend got a shower in his room but a fireplace instead.Safe area and clean rooms.Liked having a fridge and hot water for tea in the room.Chinatown and Paddy's Market is a 15 minute walk. Cons:A weird thing about the room, you have to put your key holder in a slot to activate the lights and AC. When you leave the room, all electricity is turned off except for the fridge. When you return, you have to reset you clock radio.Cafe was still under renovation, so no breaky downstairs but there are places to eat around a block away.Have to walk to the main road for buses.Central train station is a 15-20 minute walk up a hill. A pain with luggage and they don't have a hotel shuttle.Location is off the main road, a two block walk. There is an internet cafe around 4 blocks away and a large indoor mall, no public access computers for hotel patrons inside hotel.The staff''s customer service was a hit or miss depending on who you got to help you.On Waddle Street, you hear some traffic noise at night.

<Content>Location...location...location Vulcan advertises itself as being in Darling Harbour bet be warned .. its not!The bus service is not far away, but Sydneys roads are clogged all the time, the walk to the monorail is some 10 - 15 minutes, as is the walk to the train (tube)Darling Harbour itself is some 15 - 20 minutes walk away.We experienced a problem with blocked fire exits which the staff cared not about. Fortunately the owner overheared my complaint and dealt with it.The renevation work is still going on and seemingly will be for some time.

<Content>A decent place to rest your head I stayed at the Vulcan Hotel recently and found it to be quite a nice hotel. My room was a nice size room and clean and comfortable. There was some renovation going on in the ground floor cafe but I was not disturbed by it. The service was great and very refreshing from most hotels. I arrived at 8am in the morning and reception allowed me to check in early, very nice after a 24 hour flight.

<Content>Beware: still not telling about renovations! Same as Applebaum:We stayed at the Vulcan Hotel for a few nights in September 2006 and despite booking directly through the hotel we were not forewarned that building work was (still!) taking place.Aircon worked but considerable noise started at around 7am pretty much every day. The place is turned into a lovely hotel (v small rooms though) but the fact that the hotel has decided not to tell customers about ongoing renovation work makes me wonder what they think of their customers?!I really like the location as it's close to Glebe and Broadway. Public transport just around the corner.

<Content>Beware of renovation work We stayed at the Vulcan Hotel for three nights from 17-19 July and encountered various problems mainly due to the renovation work taking place. Despite booking directly through the hotel we were not forewarned that building work was taking place.On arrival we discovered one wall of the hotel was completely missing making the entire building freezing. The room aircon/heater did not work meaning we were alternately boiling and freezing all night. Our room was not cleaned during our three night stay, at times there was no hot water, then no water at all, the mini bar did not work due to the builders cutting through the power supply and the bathroom fan did not work.The Vulcan is a nice enough hotel, and will have an elevator once the renovation is complete. We did receive a $50 refund once we complained on departure. It is handy for Glebe, to which it is a lot closer than Darling Harbour but its location on a busy road does not make it an ideal choice.

<Content>Our Summer in Sydney Had a wonderful stay in the charming Vulcan Hotel. Our friends stayed there years ago and the said to give it a try. We did expect such a lovley place for the rate we paid, well worth every cent! So close to everything. We really enjoyed Sydney and we hope to return again soon!

<Content>not again! location not bad 20min walk to darling harbour,the vulcan is a listed building so no lifts which may not be a problem for some but when you are woken up with suitcases banging on every step in the morning it`s no joke,the rooms are very small the fridge is half the size of the bed,bed sheets did not get changed for 3 days it`s a very grey hotel,meaning it just drians you being there we spent as little time as poss there.

<Content>Good value in Sydney We stayed 4 nights at the Vulcan over Christmas 2005. We were happy on the whole and thought it was quite good value but can see where some of the negative reviews might be coming from.On the plus side it cost Aus $120 a night, was not far from the city centre, rooms were pretty new and quite well equipped. You can walk to Darling Harbour in around 15 minutes or there is a very frequent bus service with a bus stop just a few minutes away with buses to Circular Quay, George St and the main train station. There is also a shopping centre nearby so you can buy breakfast and picnic stuff (there is a fride in the room, as in most Australian hotels). It is true that there aren't really any restaurants nearby but there are a couple of take aways and the shopping centre has lots of cafes and a food court. If you wanted to go to a proper restaurant you's probably be looking at Darling Harbour. It's also true that the area is not particularly attractive, but it didn't seem dangerous and we were not uncomfortable walking at night.It was very quiet (the room was on a side street) but it's true there's no lift. The room itself was fine but the only thing we were not too happy about was the service - the reception was closed after about 9.00 pm till 7.00 am and on Christmas Day there was no maid service. Then the next day the maid knocked on the door at 10.00am when we were still in the room. We went out at 11.00am but when we came back that night they hadn't cleaned the room. We thought of it more as a luxury hostel than an international style hotel.

<Content>best hotel bed i've ever slept in! my husband and i stayed in the vulcan recently, as we had a christmas function to go to at darling harbour. we found the room great, bed was so comfy i had the best nights sleep. staff were very friendly and helpful and it was very quiet despite being heavily booked at the time. i would definately recommend the vulcan to couples wanting to stay close to sydney's hub, public transport's a breeze!

<Content>terrible experience; never find a worst location Stay away from this hotel!!! Didn't sleep all the night. I booked a month earlier asking for a room not on the main road. They gave me a room on the main road. I didn't sleep all the night. Breakfast was poor and very expensive. Pay attention!! you pay for every peace you eat!!!They are not very kind. My suggestion: Go to the Novotel, nearer to the centre, better and less expensive.

<Content>Not a big fan!!! Not a particularly good hotel at all. In a decidedly crappy part of town - once night falls don't even think about walking anywhere. Claims to be 5 minutes walk from Darling Harbour are well exaggerated - probably closer to 15 mins walk. The hotel does not offer cable TV as it claims - and the television it does have has incredibly poor reception. No nearby restaurants or even crappy takeaway - not a problem if you don't eat I guess! I booked a Deluxe room - HA!!! Very small room indeed, for the life of me I can't imagine a single deluxe feature of the room. No lift - hopefully stairs are to your liking - especially with a few suitcases (makes a wonderful first impression to have to drag suitcases up 3 flights of stairs). Anyway ... stay here if you have to, but, if you can spare a few more bucks - try somewhere else - (I stayed at the Savoy - Double Bay once, $15 a night cheaper, better part of town (in fact the best part of town) and a great little hotel, had a nearby supermarket, restaurants and cinema - try that one instead.

<Content>Its Great We have stayed twice now and will stay six more times this year as we go up on bussiness. We stay four nights at a time. First trip we stayed in a twin room with ensuite. The room was nicely done out and very clean but way to small. Second trip we stayed in an Appartment suite which was much larger, with a balcony and a microwave. Much more comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the place is kept to a very high standard.

<Content>A little gem Stayed in Sydney for 5 days in August, and booked this little bed and breakfast on-line a little unsure of what we would find.When we arrived in the late evening the reception was closed, and the night porters let us in. Our room was small, but the decor was lovely, very clean, coomfortable and modern.If you like the 24 hour service of a traditional hotel, then this isn't the place for you, but if like us you want somewhere with character, friendly, and with the personal rather than corporate touch then I would highly recommend this place, and for $100 a night in Sydney, it's a bloomin bargain!If I'm ever lucky enough to return to Sydney this is where I will be staying.
