<Content>Location and friendly staff vs. cleanliness We ended our tour of Europe at this hotel. We found it very close to the tram stop and were very pleased with the central location. We were greated by Will who is extremely friendly as is the lady that runs the desk during the day. Our room was a canal view and while the view was nice we were on the top floor which made our room feel smaller with low beams you had to duck under to move from the window to the door. It was not what was pictured on thier website. The bathroom was kinda scary and the shower had a slow drain and the entire bathroom floor was a puddle of water when showering. It was not the cleanest room we had encountered, but the bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean.The free breakfast the first morning was very nice. Lots of meat and cheese choices, some sweet breads/cakes, and great coffee. The free internet access was a nice plus.I'm not sure if we'd stay here again due to the lack of cleanliness. I understand that it's an old building, but they need to do some upgrading to the carpet and tile.

<Content>Terrible experience If you are looking for an apartment where furniture is old and in bad shape, where the word 鈥渃lean鈥?is unknown and you pay a lot, then the Amsterdam House apartments are the right choice. When we booked via internet, one third of the total amount was immediately charged on our Visa card and when we arrived there, they made us pay the rest before we had even received the keys. Then during the two weeks of our stay, I had to go every day to the reception to ask for my receipt! The receptionist found every single day an excuse not to give me any piece of paper saying that I had paid! When we first saw the 鈥渁partment鈥? we were extremely disappointed: it had nothing in common with the pictures we saw on their webpage. The description said 鈥渇ully equipped kitchen鈥? what a sad joke! We did not even have real pans to cook in. The bathroom smelled so bad that I vomited three times during our stay. The beds were very uncomfortable and the TV set did not work properly. But perhaps the worst thing was that the whole apartment was so awfully dirty. We tried to clean it desperately as soon as we arrived. So we really felt that we were cheated!

<Content>wish I lived here!! Found this hotel by the website easytobook, which I would recommend as being legitimate and trustworthy.Let me first say that I LOVED this hotel, everything about it. I was checked in by Will, a wonderful, friendly, kind man, who was very helpful and kind throughout my 2 day stay. The free, delicious breakfast the first morning was an added bonus, and I ate there again the morning after (good value for 10鈧?. The rooms were comfortable, with DVDs to borrow from downstairs, free internet, and a direct line to phone home with (after buying a calling card). Pretty canal view from room 32, and a clean bathroom.Here`s what tipped this hotel over the edge: I booked into an apartment for 5 days after staying at this hotel for 2, because the apt had a kitchen. Let me tell you, I wished I`d stayed at Hotel Eureka. It feels so warm, friendly, inviting. Will with his classical music at night, have a cup of tea in the warm sitting room. I lost the keys to my apartment on the 2nd day and was able to come to this hotel and they helped me (gave us free tea and allowed the apt owner to phone me there when they got home). On my last night I went again and was given tea and a place to be quiet. If you dont need a kitchen, then I cant imagine why you`d stay anywhere else in Amsterdam. Unless you`re after 5 star accommodation. But at 110鈧?night, the price was right. If I go ack to Amsterdam I will only stay here.PS if you read the other reviews you`ll see that everyone loves this hotel!! :=)

<Content>By Dutch standards...... The good: I loved the people running the place. The location couldn't be better. Breakfast was awesome. Laid back atmosphere. Cool vintage guitar place next door. (The guy running the guitar shop is kind of a grump. Neat guy though.)My son, (19 yo), and I, (55 yo), had a blast in Amsterdam and part of the reason was this place... We checked in at the front desk and was warmly greeted. Got the key, walked up a treacherous stairway ( there was an elevator however), and opened the door to the room. Oh my. Stained bedspread, old red shag carpeting, extremely small, no view whatsoever, old plumbing fixtures, kind of smelly. Went back down to the desk to change rooms and she said no can do. Unfortunately, we had prepaid. ...Oh well....Maybe I've lowered my standards. Did the coffeshops put something in the tobacco to forever ruin what's left of my brain? Would I suggest this place? Hmmm... I think I would. Yeah really. Maybe not with my wife. If I was very concerned, I high ly suggest getting a canal side room. Then the wife would be happy. They are fine, in fact, really fine. Otherwise, lower your standards, smile at the front desk clerk, enjoy a great breakfast, and make the most of it!

<Content>A brilliant quirky little hotel! My partner booked a weekend in Amsterdam for my birthday and what a present it was!! We thought the Amsterdam House hotel was fantastic, full of character and totally in keeping with the laid back atmosphere of the city. We could have stayed in a posh hotel where everything matches but we loved the old furniture and home from home feel of our room. The staff were friendly, helpful and polite and were always on hand to give directions or suggest places of interest. The location was perfect too, overlooking the Amstel and within walking distance of the many shops and bars. We thought breakfast was fab, lots of choice and so much of it, served between 8.30 and 12pm so plenty of time for a lie in!! I would not hesitate to stay here again, it was the perfect base for a great weekend

<Content>Last minute upgrade My friend had been in this hotel years ago and he was very happy so he booked again it for this year. Unfortunately when we got at the reception to get our room a polite woman happily announces us that we have an upgrade, that's a self-catering apartment with canal view. It looks fine until we experienced the most noisy apartment ever. Someone had a party on the first night and we also received a telephone call at midnight! Basically we could hear people walking and talking as they were in our flat. We complained with the reception but nothing has changed and it was very disappointing not to have the room we asked in the hotel instead of a very noisy self-catering apartment. As a result I did not sleep for 3 nights in a row and ruined my stay in Amsterdam from this point of view.

<Content>Biggest disappointment in years of travelling Let me say in advance that our experiences in the past with Dutch Hotels, have been excellent, so we had no doubts orfears that booking an Appartment in Amsterdam House Eureka via the internet, would lead to any disappointment. We booked the appartment (to show our little grand-daughter Amsterdam) for 3 nights at $192.- per night - half of which we paid on booking and the other half immediately on arrival (without having seen the appartment). Much was our surprise (and horror) as to what we found in reality! A scruffy, dirty, two roomed appartment, with windows that in spite of the heat, one could not open (they were screwed closed), without the minimum of required facilities. The bedframe was broken, the bedcover was stained, and in the bathroom there were no amenities to hang a towel, or clean ones teeth. On the second day, the bathroom ceiling lamp exploded and showered glass all over the bathroom floor.The staff in the Hotel were very sympathetic and helpful, but said they could do nothing without the permission of the owner.We took photos of all the deficiencies so that our complaints can be substantiated.

<Content>Cosy hotel with great location We booked one of the more expensive, canal-facing double rooms for our stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary. I thought the room was wonderful, full of character, and the view was great.The staff were perfectly helpful and friendly and the breakfast room is lovely - although I thought the breakfast was a little overpriced for what you got.It's just a short walk or tram ride to all the places you might want to visit in Amsterdam.

<Content>Most Friendly Hotel in the City! What a find this lovely little hotel was! The best part of the deal was the staff - gracious and helpfull at all times of the day. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the tea and coffee in the evening was an added bonus. The room, though slightly small for three, was sufficient as we spent little time there and had the dining room for additional space. Everything was clean and our request for extra towels was quickly filled. The free Wi-Fi was useful to give us directions to museums and tourist sites. Easy walking distance to everything we wanted to see in Amsterdam. Great little cafes right around the corner and across the canal. There are lots of littel hotels in Amsterdam, but what made this special was the staff. All truly liked working there and seemed to find satisfaction in providing excellent service. Would definitely stay there again!

<Content>friendly and clean On our arrival at the hotel we were treated in a very friendly manner, given a load of sight seeing maps and brochures, and a general rundown of where all the sights and shopping centres were, which we found to be most helpful. The hotel itself although small was clean and served a lovely breakfast (buffet), it also had on line facilities and library with daily newspapers. A few minutes walk took us to rembrandt plein where a large choice of restaurants were to be found, also the shops on rokin and kalverstraat are nearby, making the hotel very central but not noisey.We had a great 5 days in Amsterdam made more enjoyable by the hotel staff who went out their way to make our stay as carefree and pleasant as possible.A big thankyou to all at the hotel for giving us a fine experience of Holland and Amsterdam.

<Content>A really lovely WELCOME We dropped into the Eureka on a busy Saturday afternoon, after being disappointed in a hotel in Zwanenberg. The lady at reception was so warm and friendly and although they didn't have a room available for Saturday night, we booked for Sunday night. On arrival at the Eureka we were met by Will who was again very welcoming and shown to a lovely room on the 2nd floor overlooking the canal. We had every comfort in the room and a great night's sleep in a large comfy double bed. Breakfast was free as it was our first (and unfortunately last) night of the stay, and was a delightful buffet of cheese, breads, meat, fruit, yoghurt and other sweet delights. I've haven't felt so relaxed in years and will definitely be booking with Amsterdam House Hotel Eureka for our next visit. In my view they saved my weekend away from being a complete disaster. Thank you.

<Content>Great Stay We had a pleasant stay at the Amsterdam House after a transatlantic cruise.It was our first time in Amsterdam, the location couldn鈥檛 be beat and it was very quiet.There is a world class chocolate shop(Puccini) and a deli(sterk staaltje de eetw) around the corner on staalstraat. MacBike for bike rentals is a short walk away at Waterlooplein also. We spent a night in the hotel room and then was in an apartment. The apartmentwas on the 3rd floor and had a great view of the river. I didnt think accommodationswould be so large in Amsterdam. This apartment had all the kitchen utensils needed.There was a corkscrew, refridge,microwave, coffee maker and even coffee/cream etc.The water for shower/sink was very hot, almost too hot at the highest setting. We didn鈥檛watch too much television but there were plenty of channels.All in all it was a great stay. The staff was accommodating, location was awesome and the weather was good. I would like to try a houseboat but the hotel/apartment were sonice we wont bother with it when ever we return.

<Content>"Perfect!!!" Stayed at the Eureka Hotel from 12th April to 16th April 2008. Was early checking in but could leave bags while we wandered about the city until our room was ready. Checkin was quick and efficient. Stayed in room 42 on top floor,lovely view of canal. Room was clean and comfortable, bathroom was fine.Plenty of hot water whenever we needed it. Bed was very comfortable, and rooms were cleaned daily. Found the staff to be very polite and helpful. Loved the breakfast, incredible value for 鈧?0 per person, although first mornings breakfast is free!! Hotel is very centrally located but far enough from Rembrandtplein that you're not disturbed by noise in the night time.Would definately stay there again and would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone. We will be back!!

<Content>Mixed opinions I have very mixed feelings about this place.I should first of all say that I stayed in the hotel (as I have several times before) and have never stayed in the apartments which, unlike the hotel, seem to get consistently bad reviews.It is conveniently located between the Museum areas and the central station. Probably about a 10 or 15 minute walk, if you take the most direct route, between the two. The hotel is on a nice quiet little street and the front of the hotel is attractive.Inside, the reception area is a little cramped. There is a lift. The rooms themselves (I have stayed in three of them) are very, very small - even by Amsterdam's standards - and beyond the reception there is something rather unkempt and fading about the whole establishment. On the top floor, there is a leak from the roof for instance. The walls are thin, but the rooms and the hotel pretty comfortable.Unlike other reviewers, my experience of the staff at this hotel is that they are consistently friendly and helpful: the male owner particularly so. The breakfast room is incredibly, incredibly charming. The food is good; there are large windows looking out from a rustic room, with (in summer) ducks waddling over the footpath out front. I have rated this neutral/average because I think the rooms and the structure of the building let down what would otherwise be a very nice little hotel. There are grander, cheaper options in town - few I suspect as well located - and it wouldn't be described as luxury accommodation. But it is certainly not budget either, and it is for this reason I think the upper floors of the hotel and its rooms are a bit of a let down on an otherwise very enjoyable stay.

<Content>Not bad if you like dirty accomodations I am sick of this place. 3rd stay and it has only gotten worse. I can't believe so many of these reviews say nice things. The office staff is deceptive, lies about the prices whenever it seems to suite them and nosy about what you are doing. The service - if you could call it that - is horrible. I just returned 3 days ago and am already planning my next trip.Amsterdam House will not be where I stay next time.

<Content>Great value hotel! We stayed at Hotel Eureka for 4 nights and greatly enjoyed our trip. The Hotel was clean and functional, if a bit cramped, though that's the norm for Amsterdam. The staff were friendly and we were given free breakfast on our first morning. The breakfast is a large buffet and, like many others, I loved making my own eggs on the hot plate! We were allocated a 4th floor room, which had a canal view, although we hadn't paid the extra for that. The location is excellent - central without being noisy or sleazy. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a bargain break!

<Content>Run down, shoddy and much further from the city centre than advertised We stayed in a 2 bedroom houseboat owned by this hotel on the weekend of 3rd November. There were many problems:1. The photos on the website did not match the actual accomodation2. They implied that the boat was docked near the hotel which is very close to Rembrantplein, but actually it was miles away3. The actual boat was dirty, the toilet was smelly, and all the furniture was old and scuffed.The toilet/shower was tiny, about 2 foot deep by 5 foot wide. It was smelly, damp, and with very little ventilation (a tiny window that didn't open fully).One bedroom was massive and the other was a box. The carpet in the bedrooms were very dirty and very worn. The tablecloth on the coffee table was filthy with stains and marks on it, and the place just felt grotty and grimy overall.I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone.

<Content>Beware!!!! I stayed numerous times at the Amsterdam House Hotel, which is not only the Eureka, but a collection of apartrments and houseboats. I spent many, many dollars at this establishment, and felt that I enjoyed a good relationship with the owners. But I must say that the owner is not very honest with her tenants, as has been reported by many people here.I had a situation where I had booked a houseboat for a specified number of nights. Mind you, I had stayed with them on MANY occasions and had spent a lot of money on the hotel. I usually rented a large houseboat, even though it was only for one person, me. I had an emergency at home, and asked the owner, who then called herself Wilhemina (since then has changed her name) if it would be possible to check out early and get a refund on the 4 nights I would not be staying there. She said my credit card would be credited the amount, which made me feel very good about her and the establishment. When I returned home, after several weeks, I notice that the credit had not been posted. When I attempted to call her, she hung up the phone on me and would not even attempt to speak with me. My credit card carrier advised that I dispute the charge, but believed her instead of me. I can understand their position, but I would have thought that after so many visits and having spent so much money, and having sent numerous guests to her place, that she would have accommodated me.In short, they are very stingy people and could care less about their guests -- only getting your money.I would definitely stay at other establishments where you will be appreciated and welcomed back.

<Content>Do Not Book Standard Room Just back from four nights in this hotel. My only real gripe was that(possibly own fault) was the standard double room that we booked was the worst we have had on any of previous four visits to The Dam. Asked for better quality room but would have had to pay a further 40 Euro per night...besides hotel was full. Had booked this as part of a 50th gift for fiancee and there was no real space in the room. We had paid roughly same price 2 year ago for bed/breakfast at nearby Hotel Nes and had great view over canal. ROOM in Eureka consisted of very large double bed which took up most of room, thin wardrobe (no drawers anywhere), TV, dvd player, hair dryer, tea making facilities...our room was at back of hotel facing other back rooms, pipes. SHOWER room was small but expected that but hated shower as itwas of the type where curtain goes to floor and drains as floor on a slope...this did work ok but would have prefererred something to stand in. STAFF were very helpful and did explain this was their lowest standard of room and could not fault them as during our stay they were most helpful. As been to The Dam before we found this an ideal situated hotel. In the hotel we thought the stairs and walls, decoration in our room was quite tatty. Breakfast was excellent and free on first morning, 10 Euro the rest. I thought an idea would be good to offer the complimentary breakfast on the last day, especiallyfor those who spend that bit too much and a good breakfast before flight home would be excellent. Overall, you get what you pay for in most hotels, if you get a great room by paying the standard price good on you. We did have this booked since November last year and hade-mailed our requests but got no response. We were on top floor room 45.

<Content>Avoid This Hotel My husband and I travel at least 5 times a yr all over the world and I have to say this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed in.We were given room 15 on the back of the hotel it was very small, there was a small window which looked out onto a brick wall, it was very old fashioned with red shag pile carpet which looked like it hadbeen down for years, stains on the walls,and the bed and linen were DAMP. The bathroom was a disgrace with mould all over the tiles and NO COLD RUNNING WATER., We tried to change the room but there was only one room available foran extra 40 euro's which we were happy to pay but the room they were offering was even smaller with two single beds which lay head to head along one wall. They wouldn't give us a refund so we could stay elsewhere so we were stuck with the room.We didn't stay for breakfast we couldn't wait to get out.Although the location was good I still strongly advise you not to stay there.

<Content>Great Location We stayed for 6 days and really enjoyed our visit. The apartment was simply but adequately furnished with everything we needed.The location and the view were superb. Only 2 minutes to walk tto the Rembrandtplein and 10 minutes more to reach the Dam. An absolutely superb view, overlooking the Amstel and the Munt tower. Always plenty to see and we spent happy times watching life in Amsterdam float past us. It was never too noisy to sleep at night, despite the close proximity of the 'night life'.Everyone at Amsterdam House were welcoming and helpful.We will definitely return.Paula  Eric

<Content>Top location, Great Value... We met the owner of this hotel on arrival - very friendly! We had a great room, with a view of the canal. It was a baking hot room, but nothing opening the window couldn't cure. Most importantly, the bed was big and comfortable and the shower powerful - for the money I can live without a massive ensuite. Importantly too, the hotel had a lift. Occassionally you could hear guests in the corridor, but it was not intrusive. The hotel is relatively central - only a short walk from rembrantsplein and the metro. I would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Like a dream!! I stayed there with my fiance and we just loved it!! The location is great, where you can go waking to almost everywhere. Choose a room with a view of the canal amstel. The decoration is lovely, the breakfast delicious and the reception very kind. The room was a bit small, but very good and the bed had a good size (double). Very close to a good restaurant (like 50 steps!) and a market where you can have for lunch a lot of thing and for a good price.

<Content>A little gem of a place! We stayed for one night in November 2006 and found this hotel to be ideal.It is a ten minute walk from the central station and just out of the way of the centre but close enough on foot ( 5 mins tom Dam square,ten minutes to the red light district) The rooms were small and basic but very clean and with its own toilet/shower suite. The staff (Will especially) were really helpful and friendly and could not do enough to make our stay as good as they could. The breakfast was ample and it was great to be able to cook our own omelettes on the hotplate!!! Overall i would highly recommend this place as we had a disastrous night the night before at the Hotel Hortus (do not stay there at all it is awful!) and this was an absolute pleasure to stay in after that.We would most certainly go back.

<Content>Friendliest Hotel in Amsterdam? This was our first visit to Amsterdam, and we chose the Hotel Eureka based on generally favourable Tripadvisor reviews. We were not disapointed. Arriving mid-morning following an early start from home we were treated to a comlimentary coffee and slice of apple pie in the lounge (these personal touches mean a lot and this was typical of our stay). We had asked for a double room but there was only a twin available and although the receptionist offered to change us the following day we decided to keep it for our 3 night stay. The room was unusual being long and narrow with the single beds end to end rather than side by side. The decor was also a bit tired and the furniture is best described as inexpensive antique. However, it was clean with enough space, had lots of character and a lovely view over the Amstel River. We also had fresh flowers on the coffee table the day after our arrival. Although Breakfast was not included in the price, the first mornings was complimentary and was good enough for us to pay 10 Euros each for the following days. The hotel lounge/breakfast room had a cosy feel to it and we enjoyed a relaxing complimentary drink there each evening before retiring. The location is great for exploring the centre of Amsterdam. In the heart of the Old Town but not near the Red Light District. The nearest tram stop was only a few minutes walk away so access to and from the station was no problem.The staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful, particularly after my wife was struck by a cyclist. (Be careful, they don't stop for red lights; no entry signs or pedestrians.) Her injuries were minor but a first aid kit and a large complimentary whiskey (for me) were promptly provided. Our stay in the hotel was well worth the price we paid although we could have saved a bit by booking our room there direct. Which is what we will do the next time we visit Amsterdam.

<Content>Worst accomodations ever experienced The Amsterdam House promises to rent lovely apartments by the looks of its website. I booked this online directly with the hotel. I should have suspected something when they said they would give me the exact location when I arrived. When we went to the hotel they directed us to an office a few doors down. The office was run down and filthy and they required that I pay the entire fee up front---- red flag that I ignored.The apartment was next door, up a few flights of stairs. It looked as if it was being used an an office and files and paper work had been shoved in a bookcase. The carpet was torn, dirty. The refrigerator did not work, there was no stove, one of the beds was a mattress thrown over a short piece of particle board, there was nowhere to hang clothes, hadn't been painted in years. But here is the kicker--- the toilet was leaking and actually falling through the floor!!Had this been cheap, it would have been one thing--- but it was 250 Euro a night-- $325.00!!!!I had booked the apartment for 3 nights!! I complained the next day and said there was no way that I was going to stay there another night. They offered a house boat for the next night ( and wanted to charge me more!) This was at least cleaner and a lot of fun --- but again the appliances in the kitchen did not work. We also had to get them to turn on the hot water.The 3rd night, I was told that the houseboat was not available and would have to move again........The apartment on the 3rd night is pictured on the website. --BEWARE!! If you want an authentic Amsterdam apartment this may be it, but you will have to share it with rodents and rodent droppings all over the kitchen counters.Go out for coffee--- the coffee pot doesn't work.At no time did the management address our concerns or offer any type of refund.This outfit obviously gets away with this all the time and just rakes in the money----- stay away.

<Content>amsterdam house apartments we booked amsterdam house apartments which is owned and managed by the same company which owns the hotel eureka. having read the reviews for the hotel on your website we were confident everything would be fine. The apartment was filthy and in a bad state of repair and smelt of damp and foist. we had to pay a supplement for my 10 year old son to sleep on the sofa bed of 35 euros per night but no linen was provided. after complaining the next day I was told the cleaners would go in and provide linen. As no linen was there on our return we went to the hotel eureka and were given linen. after complaining when we got back to england we have recieved the offer of the supplement back but no apology. Perhaps they usually provide linen but arent bothered about the filthy state of the place. we were unable to use the kitchen it was so dirty. please be aware that although the hotel gets good reviews their apartments are the pits please dont ever be tempted to stay there.

<Content>I'm Homesick My husband and I love to travel. We have visited many marvelous locations around the world. Nine years ago we drove from Berlin to Amsterdam and were looking for accomodations during Easter week. We hadn't made any reservations as we were traveling spontaneously. It was almost unfortunate as most hotels were booked, but then we happened upon Amsterdam House. Our lives were changed forever. The peope at Amsterdam House were so friendly and helpful. Although they too were fully booked they said they could accomodate us with an apartment. Since then we have visited Amsterdam on an almost yearly basis. We have stayed at many of Amsterdam House beautiful apartments and throughly enjoy each stay. I am homesick for Amsterdam House and our beautiful friends. Can't wait to return.

<Content>Friendly Staff, Great Location The owner and staff speak English and are extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel is situated only a few minutes walk from the Red Light District, the Museums and the markets. The hotel is an older historic building located directly on a canal, but it is clean and well-maintained. We would use this hotel again!

<Content>Two nights at this great little hotel My husband and I stayed at this great little hotel for 2 nights, mid July 2006. We wish that we could have stayed longer.... so we are already planning to return as soon as we can !We totally agree with the positive sentiments expressed by previous guests via this site.The staff were certainly very friendly and helpful. The shower room was clean, the bedroom was clean and comfortable with great views over the Amstel canal.Being able to enjoy the substantial, buffet-style breakfasts up until noon was a bonus. Because of the very hot weather, we slept with the windows open. There was some noise from the local bars late at night, but no more than you would expect for a hotel located in the centre of a major European city.Roll on our return visit ! We can't wait !

<Content>Great location, average rooms We stayed at Eureka for three nights during a very hot stretch of weather in July. This was probably not the best time to stay here, particularly on the fourth floor. Needing to keep the windows open led to a lot of noise from the typical Amsterdam nightlife below. However, this hotel did give us an exceelnt base from which to explore Amsterdam as there are many dining, drinking, and tourist options within 5 minutes and many more within 10 to 15 minutes.The room on the far end of floor four was average. The floor tilted across the room, making for an uncomfartable night on the like-tilted bed. Even by European standards, it was a pretty small room ... the door hit the side of the bed as we entered!Its not a bad hotel and the location is guaranteed to please. We found the staff to be helpful and the lift helps tremendously.

<Content>A home from home June is high season in Amsterdam and we were lucky to get a room, so I was happy with this choice. Run by 4 people, who you see at different times doing different things, the house is like a converted home. The rooms are small but personally decorated with wonderful views on the canal. A quiet spot, near the theatre, the breakfast cum living room is decorated in plush red colours, with a bar and a copious breakfast! You can even make your own omlettes! The service was so friendly, you could not compare it with hotel chains... Enjoy your stay!

<Content>Walking distance to alot, but there's better around The rooms were clean, small bathroom (only a shower), the rooms look out into a canal (nice view), but there are a couple bars across the canal that are extremely loud all night long. You have to keep the windows open since there is no A/C.Overall the place has a smell of cat pee, luckily, inside our room was not affected.The staff is absolutely no help and not very friendly. We asked for information on when the trams run and we were told to walk to the tram station and read the map. We let the woman know we didn't speak or read dutch and she just shrugged her shoulders and said she didn't live in the city.We wanted to reserve a taxi the night before we were leaving and the woman at the front desk said she can't do it, we have to call in the morning when we are ready. I got the # for the taxi and called the night before and they nicely took our reservation. I guess the front desk woman just didn't want to do it for us.Personally, there's so many places in Amsterdam to stay, I wouldn't waste my time here.

<Content>Warm and accommodating Three of us stayed here in June (peak season) after recommendations from the tripadvisor website and whilst the rooms were tiny, the staff more than made up for it by being so friendly and helpful. We were offered a beer on arrival (free!) and the 10 euro breakfast was sensational - very good value for money. Not your usual continental breakfast (jam, croissants, etc) but a proper cooked breakfast. It was close to everything and we were able to get around easily. I would highly recommend staying here.

<Content>gezellige (dutch for cosy) eureka hotel the dutch have a word for it - 'gezellige',meaning charm,cosiness,friendliness and a place that puts you at ease right away. we stayed at the amsterdam hotel eureka for a week,14-21 june.i have stayed in stiffer,more formal and more expensive hotels,but nowhere with more real charm and easy friendliness. the room we had was no.22,with two huge windows and a handy pair of armchairs,were you can chill and watch the boats on the canal,the moorhens,the swans,and every morning,a grey heron which posed like a supermodel on the roof of the houseboat in front of us.there's also a massive and extremely comfortable bed and clean wc and showerroom ensuite,and lovely crisp cotton sheets each day. the area around the hotel is great- there are very comfortable,relaxed bars and cafes about 3 mins walk round the corner,it takes 12 mins to newmarket square and the zeedijk,5 mins to rembrandt's house,5 to rembrandt square (great for people-watching)5 to the flower market,15 mins walk to the rijksmuseum and the van gogh (but tram stops are only 2 mins away also).yet although the hotel is close to so much life,it is an oasis of calm and serenity. the house cat is a honey,and the staff here are just lovely. breakfast was magnificent - i had smoked salmon every morning! and you can eat as much as you like of a great array of salmon,ham,cheese (good cheese)yoghurt,juices,fruit and coffees,herb teas and tea.anyone who likes to feel their stay in their hotel is an effortless,informal and relaxed experience will love the hotel eureka- i did.

<Content>charming and laid back but won't suit petphobes went there for 5 nights, 4 of us. we got thereabout 12, we thought too early to check in, but one room was ready and we were welcome to leave our bags there. we were givben a 'welcome' drink by the manager. the rooms were small but charming - they go in a lot for wall-mirrors in this place! would not suit the very large/americans as there was just a bed, wardrobe, a stool, chair and table and absolutely no room for anything else! we booked late, so had a view of a sort of courtyard only, recommend book early for canal views, or houseboats. the bathrooms were also small, a shower, toilet and basin, but with a hairdryer and shower gel/shampoo, soap, cap, polish etc. easy use taps round pin plugs, but converters and apparently everything you can think of available at reception. tea and coffee making facilities you can smoke in the rooms but they do request you leave the window a little open. I didnt get the impression that they particularly wanted the other sort of smoking, but were like everyone else we met, very toleran. the beds are comfortable though a bit bouncy and the pillows springy. clean and comfortable, a little shabby here and there but nothing to worry most people. we had a dvd player with our television, and there is a supplyof dvds downstairs. clean towels and blissfully quiet. apart from the occasional door slamming or occasional burst of television from another room it was quiet, comfortable and the temperature was pleasant, though we were right in the centre of Amsterdam. breakfast is a very laidback 8.30am -12! - but then nowhere much seems to open very early in Amsterdam. good coffee or tea will be offered to you but otherwise you help yourself - cereals, fresh fruit salad,boiled eggs, toast, rolls, croissants cake cheese, ham, and you can fry or scramble your own eggs how you like them. its 10 Euros, but you can fill up, and refill and no hurry. there are plenty of cafes around, if you prefer, but you wont get a better one for less. stroll outside for a cigarette or just sit at one of the tables on the tiny pavement overlooking the canal, and you may well be stalked by a heron that visits every day for cheese, strolling up to the doors. or find a delightful cat sitting at one of the tables, or the friendly visiting dog sleeping in the doorway. its that kind of place. if the thought fills you with horror, go to some sanitised american hotel chain where everything looks exactly the same, and you cannot tell what city you are in. the eating room has a library of assorted books, some DVDs and there is free internet access on a Mac . guests strolled in and out, and chatted with the friendly people who run the place and each other, greeted the cat and dog as old friends and stepped in and out through the glass doors. the breakfast room turns into a dining room later, and a bit of a bar till about 11, though we brought down our own wine and carried on for another half hour or so after - kind of relaxed place. onto the little cobbled road which passes it on the canal-side, where we found a moorhen nesting on a boat, and 13 ducklings nesting on a tyre, also a resident tramp who lives on an old boat, and a tiny old closed gay club next door to the hotel where there was a squat party the night before we left, and they invited us in. again, didnt get kept awake at all after we gave up and went back into the hotel everyone was friendly, helpful and very tolerant of us raiding teabags, disappearing with ashtrays and borrowing glasses to take over to the party in the gay bar. acroos the bridge is Rembrandsplein, and 5 minutes walk away is the Waterlooplein and the fantastic fleamarket there, there is an internet cafe round the corner, fantastic fruit/chocolates/bread/dvd/books etc shops round the corner on Staalstraat, a few minutes from the flowermarket and trams in all directions, just at the edge of the red light district and the 'brown cafes' but much quieter. you get a room key and an outside key to get you in after midnight,and thankkfully on seeing the stairs theres a small and old but working lift. there is a safe in the wardrobe and spare bedding, shelves and hanging space adequate we found for 2 for 5 nights. so - very glad we went with the other reviews, yes its not entirely perfect - they forgot to renew the toilet paper once, but we just asked. woo - um cant think of anything else and I suppose some people would not want a cat padding round them at breakfast, or a tramp sleeping across the road, but if you want a bit of friendly, lived in style, but with comfort, then this will be one of those places to go back to again.

<Content>Quaint ,value for money,bolt hole My husband and I found this hotel delightfully situated as it is 5 mins walk to the red light district , restaurant sector and nightlife but far enough away to avoid being constantly woken by revellers till the early hours. It is 15 mins walk from the train station with bags.Our room had a beautiful canal view and two large low level windows making it light and airy. It was clean quiet and comfortable. My only small criticism would be the shabby mismatched furniture most of which was damaged and had seen better days, there were broken tiles in the en suite shower which worked well but was a bit grubby. The room was not made up every day even though we were out by 9.30 am each morning.That aside our stay was very enjoyable . Service at breakfast and from the small bar was excellent and the reception staff were warm and friendly. For the price you cannot fault this hotel ,those used to 4/5 star accom. may find it rather basic but we found it excellent value.

<Content>a great place and affordable place Of the many budget hotels that I've stayed, this was a terrific one. Clean, comfortable, and very pleasant staff. Outstanding location (right on one of the canals), and a great coffee and bagel shop around the corner. The bed was surprisingly comfortable, with down cover and comforter.An A+ experience....I'd recommend it to anyone.

<Content>charm and character my girlfriend and i are just back from hotel eureka and had a wonderfull time. we have been coming to amsterdam for a number of years now and have stayed at a number of hotels, some good, some bad and some downright ugly. i thought our stay at hotel eureka was our best yet. don't get me wrong, there are more upmarket hotels around, but many of those are the same no matter where you go, and after all amdsterdam isn't about glitz but old world charm. Hotel Eureka has that in abundance. the rooms have a fantastic view across the amstel, with upper floors having balconies. the windows open right out too which would be fantastic in summer. breakfast was good the two times we had it and all the staff where friendly. The location is perfect. turn right and you amble towards the red light district in about 2 minutes. dam square and the leidseplein are also within comfortable walking distance although there are trams if you are feeling lazy. i would also recommend perhaps turning left from the hotel once or twice which will lead you to a local market and the student district which has some nice cafes and shops we had never seen before. overall i really can't fault the hotel. the only thing i would add is that there is a dog and a cat within the hotel so to watch out for any allergies

<Content>Absolutely adored Hotel Eureka! My husband and I just spent our 10th wedding anniversary in Europe. Amsterdam was our first stop. Our visit and time spent at Hotel Eureka was one of the highlights of our trip! Everyone was so friendly and so welcoming! Our room was beautiful with a view of the Amstel. The breakfast was amazing - fruit, yogurt, pastries, meats, coffee, tea, etc. The most fun was cooking our own scrambled eggs with all the fresh ingredients. We just loved spending our mornings in the beautiful breakfast room. We loved Amsterdam and can't wait to go back. Thank you Hotel Eureka for making our visit to Amsterdam absolutely perfect!

<Content>Pretty good - not perfect We stayed here based on all the glowing TripAdvisor recommendations. Our room had a pretty canal view and was quite large by European hotel standards. But the cleaning woman never changed our coffee cups, leaving us with sticky, dirty mugs every morning, and the bed was saggy. The downstairs lounge area is really cozy and the location is good, but I didn't fall in love with the place.

<Content>Eureka! I've finally discovered a great hotel in the Dam Just stopped the one night for 50 euro's and it has to be the best little hotel I've stopped at when in the dam.It was a single room but twice the size of most other hotels, it had a kingsize bed and a lovely thick shagpile carpet.Got to be worth a visit, I'll definately be stopping again.

<Content>Wonderful place! We started our European vacation in Amsterdam, and this wonderful little hotel really rocked! The staff was helpful and friendly, when we decided to extend our stay in Amsterdam for another day the nice lady at the desk was glad to help out. Our room was wonderfully quaint and had a terrific view of the canal. We were on the 5th floor, but there is a small lift so you don't have to have a coronary climbling the stairs. The bathroom was private and the shower was clean and large enough to actually bathe in! Our bed was the most comfortable in all of Europe (we stayed in 4 different countries)! The room was quiet and clean - we really enjoyed staying there and slept very well every night.There is a small dining room in the hotel - and even if you don't take the offered breakfast (10 euros per person), their coffee is wonderful and should not be missed. On our first day it poured rain while we were walking to the hotel from the train station and we arrived very cold and wet - and even though it was too early for our room to be ready the landlady had us come into the dining room to sit down and dry off, then she made us wonderful cappucinos (for free) to warm us up. We will most certainly stay in this hotel again when we return to Amsterdam and will recommend it to our family and friends.

<Content>houseboat I have just been reading reviews on Amsterdam house and their houseboats. We stayed in the boat directly outside their hotel. It was very nice inside, although some of it seemed a bit dirty and grubby. There was a leak in the ceiling and the step between the boat and the side fell away and we had to jump it. It is a lovely experience to stay in a houseboat although very expensive for what you get. I would use them again but would want reassurance that it would be clean and not shabby. It looked as though they were neglected and run down from what was their former glory.

<Content>Outstanding.... We have just spent 3 nights at the Hotel Eureka. We chose it on the basis of the reviews below..but it was so much better than we expected. The room was cosy, very warm and our room had the most picturesqe view we have had from any hotel window anywhere. We where situated at the front of the hotel and the river was 2-3 metres away...we could watch boats meander up and down, follow a herron finding food or watch the flakes of snow fall gently from a cold grey sky. The staff are friendly and helfpful. Breakfast is great and included AND served from 8.30 -12.00 so no worries about a late night meaning that you miss out. On our final day we had to leave early but the hotel provided us with a continental breakfast served in our room. This is a great hotel..fantastic location...good value for money and easy to get to....3 stops on the tram from central station.PS Dont MISS BOOM CHICAGO!!!
