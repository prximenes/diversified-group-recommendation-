<Content>good location we stayed here september 11th to the 16th 2008. we booked this hotel through ryanair hotels although the description is exactly the same as trip advisor. we generally liked this hotel the position being the best point . the room was fine the television not great as we could only find one english channel but we didn't really watch it much, when we went to use the shower it was completely broken and must have been for a while so i don't know why anybody else had complained,they did put a whole new shower in fairly promtly though. the breakfasts were ok with luke warm coffee from a machine. the main reason i am writing this review is to let people know that if you were thinking of booking this hotel on its list of property amenities eg swimming pool, sauna, restaurant , nightclub, roomservice and various other things you will be dissapointed as we were to find there are none of these as listed in the hotel description .

<Content>Great Hotel in a central position Stayed at the Domus in July 2008.Location- The location of the hotel was perfect close to the train station and bus terminus,therefore ideal for visiting other places and few minutes away from the main sites in Florence. The area of the hotel was quiet and safe since it faces Piazza Maria Novella.Facilities- The room was good sized and included an airconditioner, tv, fridge and private bath. Even though the hotel is a small one it included all the facilities we needed, lift, 24 hour reception, al frescoes on the ceilings,nice breakfast room and courtyard outside. Breakfast was sufficient with a good variety of fruits, yoghurts, pastries,cold cuts etc. Cleanliness- The room was cleaned and arranged on a daily basis, sufficient and soft towels changed daily. Staff- This was what made the difference,very helpful,professional and answered all our queries and gave us helpful suggestions.Can't believe why people complain about this hotel, with so many things to do and interesting places to visit is CNN so important to have? If one just wants 5 star service with a porter taking his luggage to his room and having CNN one should not go to Domus.I would certainly go again since what I look for is a clean quiet room with a good location at a decent price.

<Content>Good Hotel, could use some sprucing up We have stayed here multiple times, however, since our last visit in 2005 it appears that this place needs some updating. Nothing specifically was wrong with the hotel or the room, however, it just appears, for lack of a better word, tired. The only true complaint I have is that in the past the breakfast included fresh made coffee, tea, espresso, etc. Now, they have a coffee machine. Personally, I hate coffee machine coffee.The location of the hotel is excellent, it faces the side of Piazza Santa Maria Novella, so it is about a 5 minute walk from the train platform with luggage. And overall it is still a solid value for Florence, just not the deal it once was.

<Content>Cosy hotel in great location. Good pick ! I stayed there for 3 days in December 2007.The set up and looks of the hotel certainly deserves its 3 stars. The nice Salon, furniture, high ceiling and marvelous stone floors gives it a mix of cosy  luxurious.There's a 24 hour desk and the staff is very professionnal and helpful. Somehow the professionnalism doesn't translate into a warm reception but all the same, the standard is that of a large hotel. Breakfast was typical of Italian hotels.They do not have other meal services.There's truly a marvelous terrasse overseing the square...would have loved to sit there in the hot summer months.The room was very nice and clean. Perhaps a bit small but then, when in Florence, how much time do you expect to spend in your room. Again, the room floor had wonderful stone finish and the bathroom was modern and large. My room(109) had a wonderful terrasse which only I had access to. It' was one of those enclose by 4 walls which keeps you in the shade...not useful in December but great in the hot summer months.Many sights are within walking distance - actually, all Florence center is easily done walking - and the area is quite safe at night for those that worry about area security. Proximity to the train and bus station is a major benefits as many day trips can be done from Florence - Pise;Siena; Venice -.Overall, a definite thumbs up.Keep in mind that as I was in low season, I paid less than a third than the price shown on the room tag (175 Euro). Everything is relative and the quality was great for the price paid.

<Content>Nice little hotel We visited the hotel from 17 to 20 Oct 07. It is a cozy little hotel, located near the center of the city and next to the train station. The location is what I liked the most and most importantly it felt quite safe to return even late in the evening.It is clean and quite comfortable, though the rooms are not very big. People in the hotel were very polite and helpful, breakfast was ok but the cappuccino was absolutely perfect. I would recommend it. It is a very good solution if someone does not want to spend a fortune on the stay. I would definitely choose it again.

<Content>Best choice!Had a great stay! We stayed in Domus Florentiae from 17 to 20 of Octomber. The reception was very polite and helpful, the location was the best possible, next to to the train and bus station. The hotel is small but cozy and the room very comfortable. I will definitely recommend it!!!

<Content>nice if you get to stay here On our arrival to this hotel we were told that our Air Conditioning in our room was broken (they overbooked and fed us a story), they transfered us to a seperate hotel with 6 flights of stairs- felt like a workout every time we went up and down- other than that the hotel was ok. The next day they transfered us back to the Domus for the remainder 3 nights- we loved the hotel- the patio was amazing, great location next to station for day trips, 10 min walk to all sights, great room- so the only complaint was the overbooking and sister hotel we got transfered to- so buyer beware

<Content>Fantastic small hotel!! I have stayed at this hotel four times. I first found it when I was moving away from Florence and needed a place to stay for a few nights before my new home in London was ready. They have always treated me very well! The staff are very friendly and helpful. I have stayed in the same room every visit...Room 101. It is next to the breakfast room and reception but it's gorgeous! Angels painted on the ceiling and a wonderful bathtub/shower. The only thing is, you can hear some noise in the morning from the breakfast room. Otherwise a great room. Though, I understand they have nice rooms on the above floor as well.

<Content>Great small hotel in Florence! I visited Florence this March for 6 days. I searched for hotels through Tripadvisor and bought it through our local agency. The hotel is situated on a quite square, next to a beautiful church Santa Maria Novella. It is close to all main sites - the Dome, Palazzo Vechio, or the area around San Lorenzo church. I had a small but well equipped, quite room with a pleasant bathroom and a good bed. There was no view, but I didnt mind. The double rooms were much bigger and had a view. The hotel is about 100 metres from the train station, it is in walking distance to bus that takes you to the airport. The staff spoke english and also other languages, they were really helpful - booked museum for me (Uffizzi,Accademia and chapels necessary), restaurants and weather. The breakfast includes sweet pastries, cheeses and hams, youghurts and freshly made capuccino etc.It is possible to sit outside on a terrace. The hotel is situated in the second floor of a house, there are security cameras and they lock the entrance for night, there is a lift. The hall is nicely decorated with beautiful ceiling. I would recommend my friends to stay in this hotel if they decide to go to Florence. Florence is a beautiful town, even more from inside than outside. There are so many art collections to see and the churches (Bargello,Pitti Palace, Palazzo Strozzi...), it is really necessary to plan 5 days for this. If you want to visit villas and/or Fiesole, you need to plan longer. The shopping is also pleasant, more affordable than in Milano. The airport is very small, with very few shops. Unfortunately it is impossible to get into Vassari corridor unless you are a group and plan away ahead. The food is lovely. And I recommend to sit at least once in the famous Rivoire cafe in Piazza Signoria, it is expensive but the view is worth it.

<Content>Great location, good value! We were glad that the hotel is so close to the train station in Florence. If you take the underpass from the train station and follow the signs for Santa Maria Novella, you don't even have to bother with crossing the street. The hotel is located on the pedestrian walkway right next to the church. The room was spacious and comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good and plentiful. There was a terrace but we didn't get to enjoy since we went in December. It would probably be nice in the warmer months.We truly enjoyed our experience at this hotel and it's great value comparing to the hotels that we stayed in other cities in Italy. We will definitely book this hotel again.

<Content>Good and bad Great location: 5 minutes walk from the station and the Domus (the landmark at the heart of the city) was a further 5 minutes beyond the hotel.The staff were all friendly and helpful in an understated way (which I prefer). The breakfasts were basic but ample, with authentic coffee served :-). There is also a large roof terrace off the breakfast room which I imagine is great in the warmer months. We stayed for three nights over Christmas and the hotel was virtually empty but for some reason we were give a room off the lobby which was very dissapointing in that it was small and slightly dingy with absolutely no view to speak off. Overall average/slightly above average rating given the medium level cost.

<Content>Disappointing We arrived at the Domus Florentiae Hotel, Florence for a 3 night stay on the 13th September. The weather was unseasonably hot. We had just spent a delightful 3 days in Sorrento and 7 days in Lucca at a wonderful hotel in the walled city. We had no problems in either of these hotels. We were delighted that the Domus was so close to the station. The hotel appeared clean and comfortable.We had problems with the air conditioner as it wasn't working. The manager said it was a sensitive control and he went to the desk and voila it began working. On the third day it was again not functioning and I saw the desk clerk turn it on using the computer. I had noticed several irritating bites during our stay but by the third morning I had over 20 inflamed swellings on my arms and legs.We found an insect on the bed and showed one of the insects (2nd or 3rd stage nymph in the bedbug development cycle) in the bedding of thehotel room to the Night Manager early on the morning of the 16th September. He confirmed the existence of the insect and noted several small bloodstains on the sheet (typically found with bedbug colonies). The night Manager sincerely apologised to us but did not offer any assistance or advice other than his assurance that he would inform the hotel management. We were also in a rush to catch our train back to Rome for our flight home. I had a very uncomfortable trip home as I had no antihistamines to ease the discomfort. My husband also discovered bites on his legs and back. We wrote to the manager to inform him as we paid 139 euro a night and we thought that a good faith gesture of some type of compensation and an apology was a reasonable request. The manager wrote back informing us he had had his hotel checked and it was not the source and that we had brought the insects with us in our luggage!! They are not transported on people but are commonly reported in hotel rooms when regions experience an unseasonal periods of warm weather such as currently being experienced in Italy. He informed us that if we expressed our disatisfaction with the hotel's service online he would inform other travellers that we were the source of the bed bugs not his hotel. We were very unhappy with this response as we feel that a good manager should have come up with a more conciliatory and honest acknowledgement.

<Content>excellent hotel in Florence We (2 adults and an 11 year old) stayed in Domus Florentiae Hotel in July 2006 for 1 night in a triple room. Hotel is very small (I think 14 rooms) and located across from the Santa Maria Novella rail station. Hotel looked like one of the 鈥渄esigner鈥?or 鈥渂outique鈥?hotels and definitely worth more than 3 stars. Room was not big, had central air and very nice solid wood furniture. Hotel staff is fluent in English and helpful. Breakfast was reasonable (coffee, yogurt, cereals, cold cuts, bread, croissants).All major tourist sites are in walking distance from the hotel. I suggest booking tickets to Galeria Uffizzi and Academia in advance. Line ups are brutal (especially in the summer heat) but tickets can be bought for the next day for a specific time slot for a 3E surcharge.Food was better than in Rome. Less oil and more flavor. We are in small family run trattorias away from the tourist spots. Famous Florentine steak is sold by weight (between 30 to 40E per kilo).

<Content>Great Location, no frills 3 star hotel Great location, close to train station but far away from it to avoid the slightly dodgy people hanging around. Close to all attractions (daily market too) and close to several good restaurants. Small clean room with modern bathroom, shower only. Staff a bit hit and miss, breakfast ok, basic continental, lovely terrace to sit out and eat on. Air conditioned room - great for the hot days, comfortably bed. Room was cleaned briefly over the 3 nights I stayed there, towels were not changed and floor was not swept but that didn't really bother me - just when you're paying 拢100 a night you expect it.Would recommend for location and I would return if I got a better deal, if you don't mind a pretty basic 3 star hotel.

<Content>Realy nice hotel This is RIGHT off the train station. So its perfect if you are coming into town from another city. Its a cute little hotel that we really liked. They had pretty good sized rooms, and a nice enough bathroom. Really liked their continental breakfast. Except stay away from the cafe americano. They are trying to be nice and make us feel more at home, but its basically watered down espresso. But thats okay there are a million places to get cafe in Florence. We even used their laundry service as we were coming from Venice to Rome. And it wasn't bad, $20ish and we got 2 pairs of pants, 3 shirts and a sweater done. Its very close to the main attractions and very safe.

<Content>Wonderful Place! Stayed for a week as part of our honeymoon in Italy. Situated in a very good location beside the train and bus stations for trips to surrounding regions and within walking distance to all the attractions in Florence. The room was lovely exactly like the pictures, bathroom was very modern and clean, service was great and the coffee in the morning was excellent. We had a wonderful stay and would highly recommended it to others!

<Content>Comfort at a Reasonable Price in Florence We stayed at the Domus Florentiae Hotel from July 30 - August 2, 2005. Our family of five booked two rooms, one double and one triple. The rooms were not fancy but they were comfortable, more than acceptable. It was nice to have a little lobby with a big screen TV. I sat there several times while waiting for family members to shower before dinner rather than just sitting in the hotel room. Breakfast was included, but the hotel staff failed to mention that at check in so we missed out the first couple of days. The breakfast room is intimate and charming, with an outdoor balcony if you would like to watch the city come alive in the morning while you enjoy your coffee. Parking for our rental car was a bit of a nightmare. The hotel has an arrangement with a nearby parkade but they want to park your car when you arrive and retrieve it 3 or 4 days later when you leave. We wanted our car everyday for side trips to Pisa or Sienna, so that didn't work. We ended up parking about a 30 minute walk away which was a bit of a pain each morning. We returned our car after 3 days and took the train to Rome. It is an easy 5 minute walk from the hotel to the train station. I really would have appreciated contact info for the hotel so I could have called them for directions when we were arriving in Florence but I couldn't find it on the internet anywhere. I took a business card from the hotel so here it is if you need it. Tel: -------- Enjoy your stay.GlobetrotterWinnipeg, Canada

The view from our window was perfect overlooking the church. its very close to the train station which was perfect as we didnt need to walk the busy streets with our luggage. The staff on the reception desk were lovely and made us feel very comfortable. Its a great hotel if your on a budget but also want a central base.

<Content>Excellent choice My wife and I stayed here for two nights in December 2004. Although rather humble on the outside, this hotel is a jem on the inside, and nicer than some 4 star hotels I have stayed in. Our room was beatifully furnished and decently sized. Breakfast was fairly good, and the staff were helpful, though not overly-friendly (which was fine with us). Located close to the train station and a short walk to the Duomo, we found the hotel to be perfectly located for our needs. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Exellent and Beautiful!!! This place is great. My husband and I were there in June 2003 and it has great rooms, very clean and we could see the Plaza de Santa Maria from our room. The price was great and the location could not be better. Breakfast was very good and the capucciono perfect! I hope I can get the oportunity to stay there again. Ah! Great gellato right across the Plaza!

<Content>Absolute Best Hotel My husband and I stayed there for 2 nights in July 2004 and it defintely surpassed our expectations. It is extrememly close to the train station, though you can't hear the trains. The rooms are very large and clean. For those computer junkies, we found out there is Internet access within the rooms (cost extra). There is also air conditioning. I think the best thing about the hotel is the security, so you definetly feel safe and secure. This was the best place we stayed at during our trip to Italy.

Breakfast was plain, bread, preserves and cappuccino. The room price was reasonably as well.

<Content>Absolutely Adorable Stayed there in July of 2003. Had such a nice stay half a year later I still want to write a review. Great service, very clean. Small hotel with not too many amenities but great value for money. Good location near train station and not far from the Dome. Food abundant near hotel. Excellent friendly staff. Our train left in the evening but they stored our bags for us. If you don't want to go wrong in a middle priced charming place, stay here
