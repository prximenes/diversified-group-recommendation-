<Content>Great Location The location is what made this hotel so good. The accommodations themselves are not great, as the hotel is a bit older - uncomfortable bed, scuffed walls, mismatched decor,  ancient hair dryer! But it is right in the heart of Florence, a few minutes' walk from Pitti Palace in one direction, and across the bridge to the Uffizi, excellent shops  dining in the other direction. Not sure if I would stay here again simply b/c the hotel itself was not a comfortable stay. Breakfast found me walking across the street to the cafe by the 2nd morning to find something worth eating. But again, walking distance from everything you could possibly want to see in downtown Florence.

<Content>Great hotel for anyone The Pitti Palace was the best hotel we stayed all over Italy. Great location (steps across from the Ponte Vecchio), a 15-minute walk from the train station and less than 5 minutes to anywhere else. The view from the breakfast terrace is already worth everything - how would you like to have a picture with the Duomo or the Palazzo Vecchio right behind you? Rooms are small, just like all over Italy, but very good! Comfortable bed, very clean, loved the bathroom. Staff is ridiculously nice. I recommend this hotel to anyone! On a side note: just follow the river towards Piazzale Michelangelo, and in 10 minutes you'll find a great small supermarket. Stop paying 2-3 euros for a bottle of water, as they cost 30 CENTS at the supermarket.

<Content>On the Nose The Good鈥?There is no disagreeing that the hotel is in a good location, right at the end of the Ponte Vecchio. You cross the bridge and it is right there - brilliant for reaching all parts of Florence very quickly. Great breakfast upstairs, fresh fruit, juice, coffee, cereal, tea, breads and pastries. Lovely view over the duomo and palazzo vecchio with breakfast. But be prepared to wait!!!! It gets busy.The Bad鈥?Rooms facing the street are very loud (despite windows that blocked the noise well) but I think this is hard to avoid in Florence.Rooms are on the larger side but are so tired (think 1970 d茅cor) and needs updating / renovation鈥?The walls had red velour and the floor was a strange velour texture that didn't feel clean. The bed was also very uncomfortableMy major complaint was that the room had a smell of sewage (so bad that it made us gag), and it has left a bad memory of Florence. This was the only bad hotel we stayed in during our nearly 6 weeks in Europe.

<Content>Great hotel on the south bank of the Arno The Pitti Palace Hotel is a clean, comfortable three star hotel (though it does have facilities for an evening meal, which three star hotels often don't provide) with friendly, helpful staff. It's great attraction is its location - just to the south of the Ponte Vecchio. You cross the bridge and it is right there - brilliant for reaching all parts of Florence very quickly. Great views from the sixth-floor breakfast room/terrace (where you start the day with a very good breakfast). A real gem. The lift is psychotic (makes you wait while it goes to the tenth floor, except there is no tenth floor) - - but that's the only negative! Not the place for those looking for the lap of luxury, but if the hotel is just somewhere to sleep and wash, and you want to be close to everything, this place cannot be beaten for value.

<Content>A Gem of a hotel A true gem in the hub of this beautiful city. As soon as you enter the hotel reception you experience a warm welcoming feeling. The best feature being the roof top terrace with it's stunning views over the city. What a way to start the day a really good selection for breakfast and those views, all in a really relaxed atmoshere. The staff were attentive without being over the top, just efficient and hard working. The rooms were comfortable and clean with the linen changed daily. Evening drinks and meals are also served on the roof top terraces - again a brilliant way to start your evening. We will definitely be returning to the Pitti Palace.

<Content>Never Again Apart from the location, I have nothing good to say about this hotel and I'm surprised the number of people who rate it so well.It's the only hotel that we booked through our travel agent and never again. We spent 4 weeks in Italy, and I booked all of the hotels through the hotel websites after researching them on Trip Adviser - they were all FANTASTIC.Anyway, the Pitti Palace. We initially stayed for one night, and our room was dirty, dark and felt unclean. There were no power points, the lighting was too dark and the carpet was filthy. Needless to say that I didn't sleep at all that night.First thing in the morning, I emailed our travel agent and asked her to relocate us in another hotel as we were heading off on our walking tour and returning to the Pitti Palace a week later.Unfortunately, there was a big fashion event in Florence the weekend of 18 June and all of the hotels were booked out. In addition, the hotel required 7 days notice for any cancellations. The hotels that I booked directly only required 24 hours notice.Eventually, the travel agent managed to upgrade us to another room for an additional 50 euro a night. This room was much cleaner and we had no other option but to accept it.The staff at reception on both of our stays were rude and indifferent and too busy surfing the Internet to acknowledge you when you walked past reception.On the day of our arrival (1st stay) an English couple who were checking out, left their luggage with the Hotel while they did some last minute things. On arriving back at the hotel, they found that the cash that they left in their bags had disappeared. The Hotel maintained that a tourist had walked in off the street and taken the money. Let's assume that this did happen!! I still cannot accept that this hotel did not think that it was appropriate to ensure that the bags were secured in an area that was not easily accessible by the public.

<Content>Great location, decent hotel I wasn't totally impressed with the hotel but the location is excellent. The hotel felt very much like a Best Western or Holiday Inn. It was good for a night's sleep and quiet. The buffet breakfast we good and it's on the top floor overlooking the tops of buildings in Florence. (look on hotel website for pics)Staff is just okay here, not overly friendly. We liked this hotel because it was less expensive than many others and the quality for the price was excellent. Our friends stayed somewhere else and paid a bit more and hated it. Just watch out for individually owned hotels in Florence. This is a well established hotel and you will be pleased if you need a good location and place to just sleep. Everything was clean.

<Content>Great hotel in Great location Like others I cannot understand why this excellent hotel doesn't have higher ratings - it may work to our advantage though the rack rate for the rooms is reasonable.I have stayed at this hotel may times over the years, and always return.The bathrooms are admittedly small, but the staff are wonderful, and the air conditioning works.Breakfast or evening drinks on the roof terrace are an experience with a lovely view of the city.I will return again soon.Whilst staying here don't fail to visit Le volpi e l'uva a great wine  cheese bar near hotel in Piazza de' Rossi

<Content>Excellent choice I really don't understand why this hotel is rated as low as it is. As other reviewers have said we thought it was an absolute gemWell fitted, spotlessly clean, very pleasant staff, lovely breakfast, dining / drinking terrace that it was hard to leave, what more can I say. It's position at the end of the Ponte Vecchio is ideal for the whole city centre as it is all within easy walking distance.We had a superior double on the second floor that did have some street noise up to midnight but only if you wanted the window open. The room was well fitted, very comfortable bed with clean bed linen changed regularly. The bathroom was tiny although again spotless. My wife had an issue with the siting of the hairdryer and the lack of a full length mirror but that is all. I have seen other reviews elsewhere that stated that english electrical appliances could not be used as the adaptor didn't fit. My universal adaptor did without any problem.We didn't eat in the hotel other than the more than adequate contintental breakfast. I believe hot food was available to order and at an additional cost but that we didn't try.We had drinks last thing at night on the terrace and can't think of a nicer way to end the day.I finish as a I started - why this hotel is not rated higher I do not know. reserve this hotel with confidence.

<Content>Good value This hotel is well-located and a good value for the price. Reception was very friendly and helpful. The room was bigger than expected and, although dated, very clean. Rooms facing the street are very loud (despite windows that blocked the noise well) but I think this is hard to avoid in Florence. Only downside is that I left something in my room on checking out but when I called back to ask about it the item wasn't found. I sitll haven't found it so I know it was there!

<Content>Little gem! Lovely hotel with a superb location. We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights and were pleased from the start. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean, roomy and comfortable. Breakfast was good and served in the bar on the 6th floor with great views over the city. I could not fault our stay in the hotel. The only thing to bear in mind is expect some noise as the glazing is not great, however we were able to get a good nights sleep, just get up early to enjoy the city!

<Content>Great Location This hotel is in a great location at the foot of the Ponte Vecchio. It's close to all the major sites (although Florence is a compact city) and there are plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. The room was spacious, clean and more than adequate for our stay. The bathroom was also spacious and everything worked well. The continental breakfast was good and the breakfast room itself had great views. Unfortunately we couldn't use the terrace as the weather wasn't the best. Staff were helpful and friendly at all times. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Florence and would use it on a return journey myself.

<Content>Disapointed with a few things I read the reviews on Trip advisor before booking this hotel and they seemed quite good. The Hotel is in a stunning location just off the Ponte Vicho bridge and central for the Dumo , Uffizi gallery and all the delights of Florence.The staff were polite, helpful went out of thier way to make our stay good. Avoid room 108 its like dungeon very dark because of the buildings across the road. We asked to be moved but they could not offer us another room until the last night of our stay.The breakfast was awesome but avoid 08.30 am when the hotel is full you will have to queue for a table.The hotel is clean and apart from the room we were happy with our stay there.If you go up to the square where the replica of the David statue is avoid the ice cream parlor on the left as you enter they charged us eighteen euros for two small tubs of ice cream!!!We found three small restruants near the hotel but Rome is a better place to eat.Do take the train to Pisa and the leaning tower the journey through tuscany is lovely.

<Content>everything you need WE have just returned from Florence. i have to admit i was very nervous about the hotel by reading the previous reviews. but it was a brilliant hotel with a large room and bed. The room was spotless. The location is excellent just being on the southside of the river. There was plenty of choice for breakfast and it was freshly replenished throughout the service with spectacular views over the city. The staff were very friendly and helpful. it is also good value for money - i would recommend this hotel

<Content>Best position for the tourist. The hotel could not be in a better position as it is ten steps from the Ponte Vecchio bridge! Once you cross the bridge all the areas you wish to see are 30mins max.if you are walking but most are 5 to 10 mins.The tourist city bus stop is 30metres away from the front door on the riverside. The hotel itself is well kept with friendly and helpful staff .The bedroom is a fair size and has an adequate bathroom.The room was always well cleaned and made up.Breakfast was excellent with everything fresh and a great view from this room on the sixth floor.You will get some noise coming up from the street at about 3 or 4 in the morning from people who have been out late and are going home and with the narrow streets the noise rises up the walls !!The only negative but not the hotels fault and it would not stop us returning to this lovely hotel

<Content>Great location, watch out for the funky smell... I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and was amazed at it's location especially for the price; as others have stated it's right next to Ponte Vecchio and Pitti Palace.I don't know if we got a newer room because we had a key card while others got keys but i was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room although the beds were tiny and pushed together. The bathroom was clean but could have been a little cleaner--the only qualm i had about the bathroom was the funky smell coming from the heated towel rack which can't be turned off. I'd have overlooked the smell but literally every time i stepped into the bathroom i gagged.The continental breakfast was decent especially for the free price tag. However on the last day of our stay i was eating and found a TICK on my plate!!! I really hope this was just bad luck.Besides these cons i would probably stay at this hotel again grant it if the prices are still good. Hopefully next time i am in Florence they'll fix the bathroom funk.

<Content>Good location and value though basic Let's be honest - you will not get a hotel in Florence for a better price than this. I could quibble about the hard bed, seventies decor and minimal facilities but it's clean and the staff are friendly. As everyone has said, it's slap bang next to the Ponte Vecchio and if youwalk away from that bridge, you can very easily get to the Boboli Gardens which are worth a weekend walk. Another walk from the hotel should be up to San Miniato - you can actually find yourself in the Tuscan hills in about 20 minutes of walking. A wonderful surprise.

<Content>Sometimes excellent, sometimes missed the mark Trip Adviser This hotel is in a superb location, very close to the Ponte Vecchio and consequently both quiet yet near to a great number of places of interest. Close to a number of good restaurants and with its own excellent restaurant. It is less expensive than one would have thought for such a location. The rooftop restaurant provides breathtaking views of the city; breakfasts are good with a wide range to choose from, and in the evening the food and wine are excellent. At all times the restaurant service is impeccable, nothing was too much trouble.  The staff at the reception desk were friendly and helpful and will pre-book tickets for the galleries and museums for you. The rooms were clean, if city hotel size. There was no tea and coffee available in our room, despite its being advertised. We did manage to obtain this, but the adapter needed to get the kettle boiling disappeared 鈥?we were told that the housekeeper had taken it as it was the only one in the hotel and was needed for the vacuum cleaners on all floors. You believe this? Eventually it was returned and remained with us. We could not find a lounge, were told that one was closed. Surely this is a necessity in a city hotel. These are however minor quibbles compared to having wonderful views of the city greeting us in the morning at breakfast as well as being close to the centre of Florence and also having the pleasure and ease of walking out of the front door and on to the Ponte Vecchio to watch the evening sunset.

<Content>Perfect stay in Florence Stayed here for 3 nights while in Florence. It was a perfect location right next to the famous Ponte Vecchio. Easy walking distance to everything in the city. Very friendly staff and the room was very nice. Complimentary breakfast on the rooftop every morning was beautiful and plentiful. Cost was about 150 euro per night ($210). Definetly recommened if you are staying in Florence!

<Content>Numero uno I have returned from Florence and can only say what a fantastic time we had.My partner has stayed at the Pitti palace previously[14 years ago]The location is great,no major problems with noise,the room was spotless.I note the previous comment about decor but hey ,im here to see Florence not the hotel room decor.The Breakfast bar was excellent and the staff very friendlyThere was a mild odour within our corridor however i think the air conditioning may be the source of this minor point.We would definitely stay at the Pitti Palace again.I think its location along with its other fine points win the day.And lets not forget Florence............

<Content>Good Location but Odd Hotel There is no disagreeing that the hotel is in a good location, right at the end of the Ponte Vecchio, however, the hotel is old and outdated. Here's the bad: the room was uninviting. The rooms on my floor all had flourescent lighting and no lamps. Literally, a long bulb above an old desk with a mirror. And the same but smaller lights above the bed. The walls had burgandy velour or something on long panels and the floor was a strange velour texture that didn't feel clean. The bed was also very uncomfortable and the room had a very mild stenchThe good: the location. That's about it. The staff was not very helpful at all. This is a hotel that you shouldn't stay at if you keep your standards atleast at the Marriott hotel level, which isn't too much to ask for. There were other very nice hotels in the area that are better. I'd stay away from here, unless you don't mind a room that's from 25 years ago.

<Content>Wonderful rooftop terrace for breakfast Excellent location just a few paces off the Ponte Vecchio.Initially we worried that it would be noisy but, with the windows shut, the room was peaceful even when the streets outside were alive with visitors.Room was plenty big enough and was spotless. Room service each day so we always came back in to fresh towels etc.A wonderful rooftop terrace where breakfast was taken, with views over the rooftops to the Duomo and Campanile.The self-service continental breakfast was sufficient and could be taken any time between 7.30am and 10.30 am which was great because we don't always want to rise early on holiday.No complaints about the hotel at all.The staff were very hepful with suggestions about meals out, train times etc.A wonderful holiday where we celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary.

<Content>Very nice hotel Stayed here in early September and liked it very much. Only steps from the Ponte Vecchio bridge. The room was very nice as was the bath. The staff was excellent and spoke very good English. The restaurant/bar was very nice with great views. There was also an outside terrace adjoining the restaurant with awesome views of the city. Breakfast was very good. We would definitley stay here again.

<Content>The worst hotel in Italy and Very Smelly! I was living in Italy for over a 6 months and had taken a trip up North to Florence with my boyfriend for a romantic weekend. I made a reservation at this hotel based on a collegues recommendation. Unfortunately, I should have checked Trip Advisor first because this was an expensive place for a horrible hotel. Of course the location is great, it's right near the heart of the town but if you drive there beware. There is no parking anywhere. The decor looks old and from the 60's, the bed was uncomfortable, the room was small for Italian standards, and our floor smelled like a sewer. THe breakfast room had beautiful views of Florence but that was about it! Do not book anything with the VIVA hotel chain because they are extremely horrible.

<Content>Great hotel, great location We stayed in this hotel for two nights on a visit to celebrate my husband's birthday. It's in a great location, right at the end of the Ponte Vecchio, and our room overlooked the Arno river. Yet we didn't find it noisy at all. We did expect some noise with it being right in the centre and we were pleasantly surprised when this was not the case. The two terraces on which breakfast is served give a lovely view over the town and all the sights are in easy walking distance. We found the staff helpful and courteous. I would definitely stay at this hotel again when we go back to Florence.

Room furnishings were nice, room was on the bigger side. Breakfast was included and was good -- breakfast room located on rooftop terrace, so beautiful views of Florence while you eat. Service was a little on the slow side -- it took about 45 minutes to get a battery for our tv remote control, but, other than that, the stay was great.

<Content>A Great Place! The Pitti Palace Ponte Vecchio is located in the heart of old Florence. This hotel is located at the end of the famous Ponte Vecchio. This is a great location for anyhting in Florence. The staff are great, warm and friendly. We had excellent service while there. Breakfast is included in the price, and you can't go wrong. You can dine outside on the rooftop terrace in the morning to start your day. We have stayed here for two years in a row, and plan to stay again next year! Fantastic location and service.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, great location, highly recommended I booked this hotel after much deliberation and endless trawling of websites and reviews on here. I decided on Florence after having visited for the day 16 years ago. The hotel is situated right at the end of the Ponte Vecchio bridge. A fabulous location with a marvellous atmosphere. Throughout the day the area is alive with tourists browsing the many jewellery shops and soaking up the atmosphere. Come nightfall, the place buzzes with people coming to watch the sunset and listen to the street singers/musicians. Sit around and lap it up! I stayed for 3 nights at the hotel as a treat for my 40th birthday. The Viva Hotel Pitti Palace is smart, clean and excellent value for money. Breakfast was included and was excellent, classified as American breakfast, the choice was fresh juice, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, pastries, cold meat, cheese, fruit, bread, jam, butter etc. Breakfast is served on the 6th floor which also has a terrace. Dine outside if only to see the wonderful views of the Duomo and across the city. The hotel also has a small but adequate restaurant with a basic menu that doesn't really change that much. Don't let this worry you though as the food is superb. All in all excellent value for money and possibly one of the best locations in Florence.

<Content>Great location This hotel is literally at the foot of the Ponte Vecchio. It is great if you want to be in the middle of it all. It was surpisingly quiet and we were able to sleep very well.The room was small, but kept clean and had all the right amenities. The safe was rather small and we had to choose what to put into it. I am happy to say nothing was taken.The staff were very nice and very helpful. The breakfast was good and it is served on the terrace on the top of the hotel. We had a glass of wine there on a couple of evenings just to enjoy the view.It is within walking distance of the Duomo and the Ufizzi as well as Piazza della Signoria and Loggio del Porcellino.We really enjoyed our stay here and we will definitely go back.

<Content>Great Location!!! This hotel is literally at the end of the Ponte Vecchio Bridge!!! The location can not get any better. At night you can leave your windows open and hear a man that plays his guitar each night for the tourist strolling along the bridge. It's quite a hike with luggage from the train station, so take a cab. The room was a little outdated, but was very big and clean. Updated bathroom was nice. The best part of the entire stay was the breakfast area. It's on the 7th floor, and it has a terrace that looks out onto the rooftops of Florence - AMAZING VIEW! The breakfast terrace alone makes this hotel worth the stay!

<Content>Good hotel, fantastic location We went to Florence this weekend, with some friends. We picked this hotel having read the reviews on this site. The location was just perfect, almost on the Ponte Vecchio. The hotel had messed up our booking and reserved only one room instead of two, so they had to upgrade one couple (us!) to the superior room which is on the top floor and was just amazing - bedroom with king sized bed (very firm mattress), lounge, study area, walk in wardrobe, and two bathrooms. We couldn't get the heating to work so they brought us up a portable radiator. The terrace was huge, and even had an outside shower. Our friend's room, although much smaller, was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was the usual continental, and perfectly adequate. Great views from the breakfast room as it's on the sixth floor. Staff were helpful and courteous and all in all I'd be happy to recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great room  Firstly, the location of this hotel is fantastic! You're directly opposite Ponte Vecchio so you couldn't possibly get closer to the Arno river without getting wet. And it's a leisurely 5 minute stroll to piazza Della Signoria and Palazzo Vecchio with the Duomo and other Firenze sights within easy walking distance. I'd read all the user reviews and having been to Florence twice before I knew what to expect of the location. What pleasantly surprised me was the room. After coming from a (supposedly) 4 star hotel in Rome this hotel was an upgrade despite it's lower 3 star rating. The room was large for a hotel in Italy, clean and well serviced. And the concierge/receptionist's were extremely helpful and pleasant. As other reviewers have stated, having breakfast at the hotel while overlooking the city skyline is an amazing way to begin the day. We ate at the restaurant for 1 night. The menu is limited but the food is quite good. It's still hard to recommend only for the fact that it doesn't provide the same atmosphere as dining out at a nice ristorante near the piazza. Overall my fiancee and I had a great experience at this hotel and would recommend it to others without hesitation.

<Content>Splendid Hotel and Location This is a great value small hotel superbly situated just on the south bank of the Arno by the central Ponte Vecchio. Our room space standard was fine (we were given a complimentary upgrade to a superior room while floor by floor renovation work was being undertaken), the hotel is quiet, clean and well managed, and hotel staff are courteous and friendly. The top floor breakfast room/bar has a panoramic view over the city centre attractions and over adjacent roof terraces, while the buffet breakfast itself was abundant and frequently replenished. We would definitely book the Pitti Palace upon any future return to Florence.

<Content>Superb location I booked a short 3 day trip through last .minute,com so it had to be a bit of a lottery regarding where I was staying. The Hotel Pitti Palace could not have turned out better. It's location right at the entrance to the Ponte Vecchio meant that it was only a few minutes walk to all of the major places of interrest, with the piazza Vecchio and the Uffizi literally just around the corner and the Duomo only 5 minutes away. I travel alone so was given a single room, which to say the least was small - but having said that, it was well furnished and clean. The bathroom was also good, which I find is an important indication of the way that a hotel treats it's guests. The room was cleaned each day with clean sheets on the bed and clean towels in the bathroom. One big bonus was the buffet breakfast which was excellent, with a wide choice of cereals, fruit and pastries. Certainly scope to eat enough to set you up for the day. To cap it off, the staff were friendly and helpful. Altogether a pleasant stay.

<Content>Pleasant and convenient We enjoyed our stay at the Pitti. The convenient location was a huge plus, since it was over 100F when we were in Florence, and we could get to wherever we wanted easily. The room, while not luxurious, was certainly clean and comfortable. We expected it to be noisy, but even though our room was just across from the bridge, the noise was not a distraction. We loved the roof bar and the morning buffet. One of the barkeeps makes a GREAT Manhattan! My only issues were the size and speed of the elevator, and the lack of Internet access. However, there was an Internet place a few doors down the street....but not free. The staff was friendly and quite helpful. One thing that would have been useful was a list of the neighborhood restaurants, since meal service was somewhat limited at the Pitti. I would stay there again.

The hotel itself was wonderful, clean and well run. The rooms were generously sized as was the bathroom.  The staff were very helpful. Breakfast was great and the view from the breakfast room can't be beat. I would definelty stay here again

<Content>Excellent Value!! I saw the reviews on here and was a little hesitant. No, this is not a five star hotel, but the rates are great and the location is top notch. We are Americans and did not experience any ill treatment. In fact, all employees were very helpful and accomodating. The evening doorman was exceptional in providing excellent service. We walked to all major locations from the hotel. The staff went out of their way to make this a memorable experience and gave us excellent recommendations during our stay.

<Content>Fabulous hotel, great service My husband and I visited in high tourist season and since they were filled, we were upgraded from the double room we had booked to a suite, no extra charge. The room was enormous and immaculate. The staff was helpful and offered suggestions on places to dine. The location is excellent, at the foot of the Ponte Vecchio, and within walking distance of everything that is a must-see in Florence. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Unexpected Charges Nice place to stay. In a central location, but, I was charged $ 189 EU for Belstaff. I have no idea what that is or why. I was not told of this until I got my credit card bill.They did carry 5 bags to my room from the front door. But, over $200 us dollars?Will not go back.John MullisMacon, Ga

<Content>Great for the price I spent six days at this hotel. I found it to be clean and the room was spacious with an adequately sized bathroom. I requested a nonsmoking room and received one; I did not notice any smoky odors in the halls or elsewhere. The breakfast selection was excellent and the room indeed stunning. The hotel staff was courteous at all times. I greatly appreciated being alerted several weeks ahead of time that the elevator would be out of service during my stay and offered a substantial discount. The discount was honored even though the elevator service was restored partway through my time there. The location was excellent. allowing me easy access to the center of the city and serving as a great base for exploring the Oltrarno as well. Being so close to the river and the bridges of Florence was especially lovely. There is an inexpensive internet point across the street and many pleasant cafes within a short walk. Overall, an excellent value. I look forward to staying there again.

<Content>Location Excellent The Hotel is centrally located just off the Ponte Vecchio-a five minute walk takes you to virtually all the main attractions of this wonderful city.The hotel is excellent for relaxing with spectacular views which can be viewed from their roof garden/ bar/ restaurant/ area on the sixth floor.The people are very helpful and speak good English. The breakfasts are adequate and the rooms though small are OK.We stayed for five nights (Two couples)over the New Year and were thankful we chose this centrally based hotel as we could return swiftly after gallery and restaurant visits etc. The weather was pretty dire- initially very cold then very wet before cheering up a trifle in the last two days.

<Content>Great location, what a shame! MY FIRST REVIEW ON THIS HOTEL WAS NOT POSTED!I stayed at this well-located hotel for 4 days, on the advice of two travel agents.I was looking for a hotel with a rooftop terrace  single rooms to acommodate 12 women travelling together in 2006.The noise was not an issue for me, my room was quiet.I asked for a non-smoking room and received it ( a sign on the door said so) but the room and corridor smelled strongly of smoke.The single room was very small as expected - it desperately needed refurbishment and the bathroom's mix of pipes with electric cable was worrying.As others have remarked, the view from the breakfast room  terrace is wonderful!The attitude of the staff was not! - as a single woman traveller, I did not feel welcome(ever) in this hotel.In fact - I was invisible! If I had not already paid, I would have moved.There are too many other hotels in Florence, with wonderful views and interested staff. I would notstay here again.

<Content>Beautiful city, perfect location We have just returned from a long weekend in Florence. It is a beautiful city and I can't imagine a better location from which to explore its many charms. The hotel is right at the foot of the Ponte Vecchio and all the major attractions are within easy walking distance - the Uffizi is literally 2 minutes walk away, the Duomo is about 5 minutes away. We thought we might have to use taxis or buses to get around but ended up walking everywhere, no problem though we certainly slept well!The Ponte Vecchio is always bustling but we were never troubled by any street noise - the windows are very well soundproofed. The room was clean if a little small, as was the bathroom and the bed was very comfortable. The room was comfortable with everything you needed, but not luxurious which suited us fine, we were really only sleeping there afterall.Breakfast was excellent, much better than the typical continental type you normally experience. The best thing about breakfast though was the view - stunning, just what you need to prepare you for the joys of another day exploring this lovely city. The bar is also very nice for a night cap after a busy day. The desk and bar staff were very helpful and friendly, booking tours for us and advising on places to eat etc. For a three star hotel I really dont think you could do better.One final thing to mention - do try dinner in the Acqua Al 2 (5 minutes walk on Via della vigna vecchia) - wonderful atmosphere and great food - try the pasta sampler to start and the blueberry steak - amazing!

Really good accommodation, in particular we enjoyed the roof terrace with spectacular views over the rooftops of Florence. Very substantial breakfast served by very attentive staff. To be recommended and worthy of more than 3 star rating - would def return here.

<Content>A most relaxing stay Our stay at the Pitti Palace was enhanced by the warm assistance of the staff, the comfort of our room and the unparallelled view over Florence from the breakfast room.From the time we arrived until departure eight days later, the reception staff were always helpful and offered advice on a range of issues. Our room was clean and comfortable with a small balcony overlooking the entrance to the Ponte Vechio, and the ready availability of internet facilities was appreciated.The only criticism would be that our room on the fifth floor exposed us to some minor noise from footsteps in the breakfast room above, but this is but a small negative in a large field of positives.

<Content>Delightful Accomodations in a Delightful City My wife, daughter and her family, and I stayed at the VivaHotel Pitti Palace the summer of 2004. After leaving a fine three-star hotel in Rome, we were set to be less than impressed with our next lodging. However, when we arrived at our hotel just a short taxi ride from the Florence train station, we couldn't believe the location! There we were, at the foot of the Ponte Vecchio, right on the River Arno. The location was ideal -- within easy walking distance of all the major points of interest. Once in the hotel, we found courteous, friendly service; clean, well-kept rooms; sparkling, tiled bathrooms; attractive common areas; and a morning breakfast on the roof that simply dazzled -- well-layed-out, beautiful, generous, with a gorgeous view of the city! We were impressed! Over the next three days, it did not disappoint. If we needed to refresh ourselves during a day of sightseeing at the Duomo, the Academia, Santa Croce, the Uffizi, or San Lorenzo, we were always only five minutes away from our hotel. The staff was always ready to assist with directions or to make a call on our behalf. We will definitely stay there on our next visit to Florence.For its comfort, service, and location, we highly recommend Hotel Pitti Palace. In a city of highlights, it was a more-than-generous complement.

<Content>Average Hotel with a Perfect Location My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in July. It was in a perfect location. However, the hotel was definately just a 2 star hotel. When we first entered the hotel, we noticed a funny smell. The hotel is very old but we felt our bathroom and room were clean. The room was very tiny and plain and we had two twin size beds pushed together. We did enjoy the breakfast and nice view on the upstairs terrace. We stayed in 3 other destinations in Italy and this hotel did not compare to the other hotels that were in the same price range. We were a little disappointed. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great location. However, if you are used to 4 star hotels, I would not stay here.

<Content>Very decent 3 star hotel My girlfriend and I enjoyed a very pleasant stay at the Vivahotel Pitti palace. Everything was clean, the staff at reception were freindly and the air conditioning was great in combatting the summer heat. The location was also amazing; the hotel is right next to the Ponte Veccio and there are beautifal gardens just a 10 minute stroll away. This is a thoroughly decent three star hotel and would highly reccomend it.

<Content>Great location - good value The location is fabulous, the rooms are clean and nicely decorated, we felt we really got our money's worth at this hotel. There is an excellent restaurant right around trhe corner (the Golden View) that sits out over the Arno river. We did not have any of the problems listed here in other reviews - no bugs, extremely courteous staff, no foul odors, nice clean rooms with excellent air conditioning. We'd stay again without any reservations.

<Content>No Better Location The hotel is actually a 3 star, I don`t know why Trip Advisor has it as one. It is in the greatest of locations, just off of the Ponte Vecchio, and walking distance to everything else (all touristy Florence is within 15min walk). Had clean rooms, AC, breakfast on the roof. The windows weren't soundproof at all, so better get a room in the back. The walls were fine, never heard anything inside the hotel. But if you want to stay in the middle of Florence, you have to expect noise outside. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Top spot I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Very quickly they recalled my room number to hand me the key when I came in the door. The staff were friendly and informative.The room was small but pleasant for a single. My balcony overlooked the bend in the road so I had a perfect view of activity in the street below. The Basagliers (the running military brass band) had their annual parade on the Saturday and I watched part of it from my room. The hotel is close to everything - about one minute away from the Ponte Vecchio and 3 minutes away from the Pitti Palace where the decadent Medici Family lived.The breakfast room was wonderful as was the food. The view stunning and the staff friendly. At the end of the day you could go upstairs and sit on the balcony and watch the rooftops and views over Florence.Under the hotel is an old wall that you may go into the basement and see. Also a Rose room with a tv and magazines for relaxed, quiet times.I would go here again.

At the edge of the Ponte Vecchio you are five minutes walk from all of the main sights of Florence, but can also walk out of the city easily to enjoy the parts that too many tourists miss.The hotel has a great roof terrace where breakfast is served, and they have great sundowner cocktails. Lots of good restaurants in the area around the hotel.The room was comfortable with a lovely view. The staff were professional and friendly. All in all a great hotel at a reasonable price.

<Content>Good time at the Pitti Palace We transfered to the Pitti Palace after a dreadful experience at a Hotel on the Via Romana.We were made so welcome,shown to the room before we booked in,and shown the dining room.The room was lovely,clean,beautifully decorated and we could see the first shops on the Ponte Vecchio from the balcony.The breakfast was amazing,and we eat a hearty meal.We were personally looked after by Sabrina Bisconti,The assistant Manager,how greeted us each time we returned to the hotel.All the staff were great.Thank you,Hotel Pitti Palace,for saving 2'Ladies in Lavender'.We will return.

<Content>Amazing location! Can't beat this location! You walk right out on the cobble stone streets in the middle of everything. After extensive hotel research, this was definitely our best bet for the price and location. Will definitely return!

<Content>Divine! This hotel, with its immaculately clean and well-fitted rooms, situated at the southern end of the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, is the perfect base for any holiday in this extraordinarily beautiful, safe and secure city.The staff are unfailingly courteous and helpful, the service is splendid, however what really sets this hotel apart from the rest is the Breakfast Room on the 6th Floor with its stunning views of the Duomo, the Campanile and a myriad of terra-cotta rooftops. What an environment to enjoy a truly sumptuous buffet breakfast that really sets you up for the day!

<Content>Disappointed The Pitti Palace is in a great location but overall was a disappointment. It has a rather jaded feel about it and the staff were indifferent. The lobby area smelled of bad drains (not sure if this has something to do with it being near the river) and this smell also began to emanate from the bathroom of my room on the second night - to add to the already musty/smoky smell which was there already (although I had requested a non-smoking room). I have to say that the room, bedding, bathroom were clean but the smell was off-putting. The terrace area where breakfast is taken has stunning views over Florence and the breakfast was plentiful although there were not many tables so we had to wait for people to finish before sitting down.

<Content>Indifference The staff is indifferent to the customer and really lacks good customer service. The rooms are in need of updating. The toilet in our bathroom bubbled up every morning from the flushing of the floors above us. If we tried to flush, the water would almost overflow. We asked for ice one early afternoon due to an injury and were told we had to wait until the terrace bar was open. The terrace with the best view of Florence was never open. Although this property is in a great location, I would have walked a little further and paid a little more to have a friendlier staff and a cleaner property. Major disappointment!!

<Content>Not a good experience at Pitti Hotel I traveled to Florence with my family (Summer 2004), and had this hotel booked through a travel agent. We arrived to the hotel, thinking our agent put us up to a joke. First of all, you are not in the proper city, but on the 'altroarno', or, 'other side of the Arno'. For the price, there are much better places to stay in Florence proper. The location is horrible, because being at the foot of the Arno, the swarms of mosquitos are enormous. At night, the window was covered in a film of flies and mosquitos. The hotel is also situated on a very busy road/intersection, which was extremely loud and chaotic, not to mention smelly. It is life-threatening to cross the street. I arrived back to my room the first night with a spoiled, rotten smell in my room. It was not the refridgerator. They reluctantly switched me to another room. I'm not going to even mention how dirty and disgusting this hotel is. All the bedding is from the 70's. The carpet is covered in stains and marks. Nothing has been updated since like 1960. The doors to your room are not even solid, but like wood panelling or something flimsy. Filthy mirrors in the rooms. Air conditioner barely works, and just emits a musty, warm, moldy odor. Staff was brusque, disagreeable, and curt upon our complaints with the airconditioning. We didn't even want to risk food poisoning at the free breakfast, so we didn't dare try it. We ended up swallowing our second night fee and moving to a hotel near the Capella Medici. I can only imagine the low standards of people who stay here who think it is a nice hotel. For 3 star, maybe this is a palace, but for anyone with standards, it is unacceptable.

<Content>Thoroughly Enjoyed This Hotel My wife and I, and our niece had two rooms in Pitti Palace in Sept. 2003. After a horrendous experience with a 3-star hotel in Rome, this accomodation was a delight. Spotlessly clean, very helpful staff (particularly Andrea in the upstairs lounge) and super location. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.
