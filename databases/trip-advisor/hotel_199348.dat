<Content>Pluses And Minues For An Aiport Hotel This is a so-called airport hotel near FRA but it has pluses and minues depending on your priorities, some of these may seem minor, others may be significant.First off, its a LONG way from FRA, nearly a 20 minute ride. They give you a free shuttle from FRA to the hotel but you have to pay 7 euros to ride back. The return rides don't start till 6AM so if you have an early morning flight from FRA, it can get a little tight. The rooms are clean but small and they charge for internet use. Very tiny elevators, tiny bathroom, and narrow corridors.The restaurant, where we had dinner was very nice; I tried their buffet and they had a wide variety of different hot dishes and many nice tasting salads, soups, etc. The staff at the restaurant were quick, efficient, and very friendly, and I appreciated the great service. The deserts at the dinner buffet were outstanding.I can't really complain about the stay here. It seems out in the middle of nowhere, with a big park in the area, so unless you drive, you're stuck in the hotel for the night. That being said, the hotel worked, was clean, and the price wasn't too high.If I have to stay again near FRA, and I didn't need my Marriott points, I'd probably pick the Holiday Inn North, which offers a free shuttle as well and is just as isolated and quet.

<Content>Great Staff My wife and I stayed one night and have nothing but good things to say about the hotel and the restaurant. Even though we were there on a Friday night and hotel was basically empty, the staff could not have been any friendlier and helpful. The restaurant likewise was a real treat for us.We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Super Friendly Staff I was rather impressed by this property. While in some ways it is a 鈥渏unior鈥?Marriott, the friendly staff more than made up for the simple rooms..I arrived on a Sunday and the hotel was very quiet. If you walk out of the hotel and turn left, you will find a large park, where I saw lots of Turkish families who were picnicking. There is also an Ibis and an Esso station (around a 20 minute walk away) and a couple of German restaurants (which were on side roads).If you turn right out of the hotel, you will walk through a lovely, little forest, which is full of walking, biking and running paths. About a 10-minute walk from the hotel is a Lidl grocery store (not open on Sundays), if you don鈥檛 want to buy food and drink from the hotel.The breakfast in the morning is excellent, with an amazing assortment of German breads. The gym was quite simple, but adjoining the pool area was a lovely sundeck with excellent views of the city of Frankfurt.The staff couldn鈥檛 have been more helpful and the majority spoke perfect English. A great value-for-money hotel !

<Content>Good hotel but, beware the Internet! Overall this is a very nice hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful (except for the wireless issue). The rooms were very clean and mine had a lovely view of downtown Frankfurt. The wooded park around the hotel were a wonderful escape for a morning run. Heck, I'd come back to the hotel just for the park!However, the hotel's internet plan was one of the most confusing and expensive charges I have ever encountered. The ISP they use offers several plans but, how and when you can use each plan is poorly communicated. I was 'robbed' of 10 euros because I didn't use my pre-paid time all at once. The hotel was unwilling to reimburse me for the unused time. Dumbest thing I have ever seen in a Marriott hotel. It's 2008, get with it!

<Content>Reasonable hotel, nothing special Pefectly satisfactory hotel, nothing to write home about. Location is neither airpor nor city, but I was there for a conference in the hotel itsef.Main gripe as usual: paying for internet access in room. Why not charge for water and electricity usage as well? Rip off.No non smoking room available on check in but was given a suite upgrade at no cost.Room clean and satisfactory, conference facilities good, food not bad. Didn't use pool and facilities.

<Content>Far from the city but it didn't matter I stayed for one night in the Courtyard Frankfurt Messe and it was quiet a nice experience. The people from the reception are very, very friendly and helpful and the rooms I have booked were massive! They even had a sofa and a cofee table... The bar downstairs is small but OK (friendly waiter) and the food in the restaurant was very good. And again, very friendly waiters. There was a lot of choice in the morning for breakfast, not the same quality as in the Marriott though well prepared and more then enough. This hotel is recommandable when you have a stop-over in Frankfurt or when you visit the Messe.

<Content>Loved This Lovely Serenity Hotel Just got back from this hotel on our way to Prague an amazing hotel staff was friendly and courteous. We arrive on a early flight we got to the hotel at around 9 am they were nice they check us in this is service checkin was 3 pm. They had wonderful bfast the best I've had in Europe, the hotel was very clean quiet and the shuttle was on time and efficient. The hotel is a great hotel to transit and a quick trip in Frankfurt easy access to downtown.I really love this hotel and would be happy to go back in a heart beat.Dont hesitate I have been to 49 countries and this hotel is one of my best transit and stopover hotel and well as a city hotel. Way to go Courtyard Messe.

<Content>Rude staff The airport shuttle was a handy thing when arriving after 9:30pm. 7 Euros for the return trip to the airport was not alot of money either. However, I found the staff at the hotel (except for the shuttle driver and one of the receptionists) to be rather abrupt and rude. We were told upon check in that coffee would be provided at all times in the lobby. When we went downstairs to get the coffee we were told that it wasn't for us but for the conference attendees (how would they know we weren't attendees?). The room was clean but showing signs of wear. The price was right ($92), the location a bit far from downtown but doable by bus. On the return to Frankfurt I booked a better hotel for less money, with a happier staff.

<Content>Great but not really an airport hotel Stayed one night during a Frankfurt layover. We were a family of 4 including two small children. The room had a sofa bed which was handyVery clean hotel. What you expect from courtyard. Very friendly front desk staff. Great breakfast buffett except for fish-looking stuff (for the Asian clients) which was not very appetizing at 630am!The only downside: this is NOT a real Airport hotel as you come to expect in the US. It is a bit away and the shuttle is by reservation and fills up fast. So we took a cab both way and it cost 25 euros each way. I suggest that if you are really tired and it is late and have kids and dont mind paying alot, just stay at the aiport sheraton for the convenience fo not having to go outside the airport..

<Content>Great Customer Service! Terrific Courtyard quality customer service! All employees went out of their way to make my stay wonderful. Parked rental car in lot and stayed on the last night to wait for my flight home the next day. The hotel is a distance from the airport and downtown but convenient to the highway network and an easy drive to the airport. Friends with me used the airport shuttle without problem. Make shuttle reservations when you check in. The restaurant is spacious with excellent food at a moderate price. No need to leave the hotel. Use the restaurant before the many travel bus groups arrive. The restaurant staff also was exceptional! Great job! Our room was in excellent order, clean without problems. All is all, one of the better Courtyard stays.

<Content>Free Airport shuttle makes up for location FREE aiport shuttle - cannot beat that based on the fact the hotel is about 20 minutes from the airport. Nice driver. The shuttle only has 6 seats, so you must sign up when for the return drop off.The hotel used to be a ramada (changed to CY in 2001) when marriott sold the european ramada hotels and converted it to a cy marriott. So, this is one of the largest courtyard hotels in the world - lots of meeting space and restaraunt, etc.The location is not ideal for sight seeing, i think. we were there overnight and back to the airport the next day. good breakfast buffet!!

<Content>What a pleasant surprise We were in Barcelona paying $258 US for a small BB, but decided to break up the trip back to US by over-nighting in Frankfurt. I booked this property on Travelocity for $95 US. What a shock, after arriving and seeing what we had for the price. The staff was just amazing, they were accommodating from the minute we got picked up at the airport until we left. We had our dinner there, because there isn't much near the hotel and the breakfast in the morning. The dinner was great and waiters were just charming. The only problem for us was smoking, we're spoiled when it comes to this subject, Europe is behind when it comes to smoking policy. In Spain, no smoking in restaurants. The room was clean and large, although I did not use other facilities, because I was only interested in a good comfortable night of sleep. The bed was amazing, it may be that other beds I slept in during my trip was horrible, but I loved it.The only problem I had was connecting to wireless access for my loptop, but business center had couple of beautiful PC's with 22 inch monitors. Great bargain for the price, let these other complainers stay in places I stayed for over $250US per night?

<Content>It's really not THAT BAD!! I have just returned from a 6 day trip to Franfurt for a tradeshow, and, admittedly I was very hesitant of staying at this hotel due to so many negative reviews I had reviewed on this site! Unfortunately as the hotel was booked for me by someone else, I had no choice!However, I must say, the hotel isn't THAT far from the city centre. It took just over 10mins by taxi with an average fare of 15Euros. If you are attending a tradefair at Messe Frankfurt it is only 5 mins by taxi. There are always taxis at the hotel too. Yes, the hotel is dated, however my room was quite comfortable and QUIET! Bed was huge and comfortable, great to have a balcony with fresh air, decent sized bathroom with bathtub, plenty of wardrobe space too! Good wireless facilities, however can be quite costly, particularly if you will be staying for a number of days....eg, 5euros for 30 mins. I think the internet should be free at this hotel because there really isn't anything else to do apart from work, surf the web or go for a walk around the lake that is next to the hotel..The staff are very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel if you are in Frankfurt for work for a few days, I wouldn't advise it if you are on vacation as there are no shops surrounding the hotel!Hope this review helps you.

<Content>Dated property in desperate need of an update As a frequent traveler and loyal member of the Marriott chain, this hotel was by far one of the worst properties I've encountered. Although the staff was friendly and accommodating in every way, the condition of the property is not up to the standards of any other Marriott Courtyard I've experienced. The exterior reminded me of the older buildings found in Communist controlled countries in Eastern Germany. Very drab, dated and dirty. Not sure when the windows or general exterior had last been cleaned.The hotel staff was gracious in upgrading my room. I was disappointed to find worn, stained carpeting. Carpeting was pulling away from the wall. The bedroom was extremely small, without a television remote or a working clock. The bathroom was also very small, with a tiny (about the 2' x 2') shower with a flimsy shower curtain. There was a very small vanity which barley held the soaps and washcloths鈥攏othing more鈥攁s a result, I was forced to dress and shave outside the bath to have enough room. The bathroom door had been kicked or badly nicked at the bottom with no attempt by the hotel to repair this. The upholstery in the room was dated and the curtains were in bad need of cleaning--when moved, they emitted significant amounts of dust and dirt. Although most Courtyard properties offer complimentary internet access service, this property charges for internet. There appears to be sporadic availability of T-mobile in the lobby for those with Hotspot access. I had difficulty with this and was told they were trying to enhance the service but many had similar problems.As mentioned in other reviews, the property is far from central Frankfurt, and on the weekends, required up to a 30 minute wait to catch a bus to the train station and another wait for a train taking nearly one hour to get into the city. Cabs can be had for ~10 Euro. I understand this was formerly a Ramada converted to a Marriott Courtyard. I was never given a clear answer as to whether the hotel had ever been refurbished since Marriott acquired it six (6) years ago. I was also concerned to see that the hotel prints a customer鈥檚 full credit card number on their check out summary (invoice) along with the credit card鈥檚 expiration date and card member鈥檚 full address---a definite concern for those of us who work toward trying to avoid identify theft and misuse of our credit cards.All in all, I would recommend that if you enjoy Marriott properties, stay at the one in Central Frankfurt. A cheap ticket on the train to and from the airport is more than worth the complimentary shuttle provided by the hotel.

<Content>Great Service! Location is bad cos it's far from the city center, however their excellent service make up for their obscure location.From front desk to restaurant staff to concierge, all of them were wonderful! Great service!!!Room is average, but for the price I'm paying, I think it's pretty decent. If you wanna get to the city center, you can take a bus, at the near bus stop, then take a train to their city center. It's about 30mins journey, but waiting time for the bus can be pretty long.Overall, not a bad place to stay for transit, before you travel to other cities in Germany.

<Content>Adeuate but not at all close to the airport Was surprised at how far from the airport the hotel was. The price was reasonable and there was a shuttle to and from the airport. Be sure to make reservations for it to take you to the airport or you will end up having to leave several hours early. The staff was extremely courteous and all spoke English. The rooms were clean and comfortable. I enjoyed the dinner in the restaurant. Not overpriced, but certainly delicious.

<Content>Very remote - Not suitable for Frankfurt tourists Location: Very remote. 15 minute drive to downtown Frankfurt. If you take public transportation it will require a bus + tram and the trip will take up to an hour (depending on how long you have to wait for the bus that only runs every 30 minutes). You are in the middle of the woods and there is nothing (no shopping or restaurants) within walking distance.Room: Clean. Dated (stained carpets and walls). Bathroom is tiny. No counterspace. No bath. Only a small shower. Their beds are some of the worst I have ever slept in - like thin cardboard mats.Breakfast buffet: Tasty. Good selection of hot and cold items. Quite a few fresh items as well (not just frozen re-heated food).Other: They have a free shuttle that runs to the airport.Overall. Stayed here for two nights in different rooms as part of a tour. Would never stay here again. It is way to far from city center and not easily accessible via public transportation. The rooms are small and dated and the beds are extremely uncomfortable. Stay at the InterCity Hotel instead - we stayed there before and after our tour. Rooms are just as nice. It is in the heart of the city centre. Main train station is across the street and you get a free pass to use public transportation for your stay.

<Content>Good Hotel but need a car! Stayed in the Courtyard for three nights in July. Great location for access to road network for day trips to Heidelberg, Speyer, Mainz etc.Stayed with partner  8 year old son + found the hotel very child friendly. Accomodation tried to provide us with an extra bed (although we hadn't asked).Pool, spa  gym facilities small but sufficient and with exceptional views over the city.Room ok in size, but no bath in bathroom. Breakfast buffet plentiful and with good range. Staff were also happy to go out of their way to help.Only issue was the lack of lifts. Only two in the lobby travelling up and down 14 floors... be prepared to wait!Public transport into Franfurt ok (bus + S-Bahn) - purchase a family day pass on the bus (鈧?) - takes about 30min. If you have a car (which you will have!!) park on the street opposite the hotel(free) and not in the hotel's car park which is expensive.The hotel is a five minute drive from the excellent Rebstockbad swimming pool with its two water slides - essential fun with young children.

<Content>Nice Hotel I have stayed here several times in the past and most recently for the Frankfurt Auto Show. I really enjoy this hotel. The location is about 5K from Frankfurt, in a quiet section of town. There is a taxi stand and bus stop right in front of the hotel and you can get into downtown in about 5 minutes. The staff is very friendly and accomodating and if you drive the parking is free. The rooms are average size and comfortable for a good nights sleep. They have a resturant on site that has a good breakfast and the dinners are quite good as well. I ate in the hotel resturant a couple of nights and the food was good. If you want to go to Frankfurt and have a great time in the city and relax once you are done, this is the hotel for you.

<Content>Clean if remote value The rooms are clean and service is good. As a business traveler who spends a bit of time traveleing about Germany I have to recommend this hotel as a standard Courtyard. Clean, all the services I require, though lacking a resturant and with poor freeway access.Rooms are clean, Parking is ample, bar is open late, and Internat access is good.

I have stayed here 5 times in three years and the service has remained consistently outstanding. The is a pool on the 12th floor with a great view of the Frankfurt skyline.the hotel has an airport shuttle and free parking.YOU NEED A CAR. If you plan to go anywhere you need a car the hotel is just off the highway and less than a 5 minute DRIVE to the Frankfurt main station. There is NOT public transportation closebynor restaurants.
