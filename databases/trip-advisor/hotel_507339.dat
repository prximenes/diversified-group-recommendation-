<Content>Cozy inn, perfect location Look out the front door here and what do you see? The ocean, sand, palm trees, a band of grass, a long non-commercial pier off to the left, a coastline walkway where the occasional dog is being walked or a family bikes past. That's essentially it! Yes, you are in Los Angeles, but this little inn claims a precious, relaxing location that in our travels is quite unique. It's less than 2 blocks from a collection of restaurants and a small market, a quick walk up to the muscle beach tourist area with little food stands and t-shirt shops. The beach itself seems endless. The Google gives you the correct location when you search for 2819 Ocean Front Walk, Venice, CA You can use the street view to see the neighborhood.Accommodations were very comfortable and clean. The host, Greg, and staff were friendly and helpful. Parking right at the back door was amazingly convenient for this area (but we were there off-season). We stayed in the suite (three of us), which was very spacious, full kitchen, our own patio area.We don't demand the fit-and-finish perfection of a Hyatt, so for a right-on-the beach small inn, this gets a 5.

<Content>Great cosy place to stay in.. This was our second visit to CA this year and we chose the same hotel because it`s a great hotel for several reasons. The location right on the beach in a residential area is perfect. Also the hotel is located very near by the exclusive area Marina del rey. Restaurants and Starbucks are very close by. We stayed in a very nice and cosy room with ocean view. All rooms we saw are small to medium size, individual, clean and comfortble with big TV screens, fridge and microwave. Every morning there is a nice smell of fresh brewed coffee and some breakfast snacks are there too. The manager Greg is a very friendly and helpful person. He will make everything possible he can. No doubt we will go back when we visit CA again.

<Content>coulda been great, wasn't A nice, comfy beachfront hotel in Venice, reasonably priced (for a beachfront property), what more could you want?While the rooms were pretty at first glance, signs of aging were obvious (chips, stains). The manager was nice, friendly, helpful, but housekeeping was iffy (room was not serviced at all during a five night stay). Noise from the common spaces escape into the rooms. The bed was big and comfy, big screen tv, fridge. Free WiFi worked well.There are restaurants (some good, some bad) about a block away as well as a Starbuck's and convenience stores. There were about 5 or 6 parking spaces at the hotel. I found parking available most of the time, and there were spaces on Pacific (a block away) when the spaces were occupied. The area is more residential than commercial so exterior noise wasn't a problem.All in all, pretty nice place to spend a few days, but for the $, expected better.

<Content>A gem in Venice Beach! My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights while visiting our college student son who lives in the area. We booked this hotel based on the positive reviews posted here, but I still had some doubts.... However, I am pleased to say that we had a great weekend in a great little hotel! We had an ocean front room and could literally sit on the bed and watch the ocean, beach, and all of the interesting people walk back and forth. I was concerned that it might be noisy, but there is a quiet time enforced at night and noise was never a problem. It was a clean, small room with a comfortable bed. The shower was nice, but the bathroom is very small and there was no place to put things (the medicine cabinet had a broken shelf) so I didn't like that. Parking is limited behind the hotel but there are other places to park along another street. But such a small complaints; everything else was just fine. There is a computer for use by guests. The coffee was good. The manager was friendly and helpful. There are plenty of places to eat. And walking along the beach, or skating, or biking, is great! The price is reasonable, especially compared to the outrageous prices in some of the hotels in Santa Monica. I definitely want to come back here again!

<Content>great october weather This was our second visit to Venice Beach and this hotel. We enjoy being right on the beach and not having it cost a fortune. October is a great month to viist, good weather and less crowds, during the week especially.The roof top deck is a wonderful spot to view the sunset and the ocean. The patio out front is spacious and clean,,enclosed by a glass wall that helps keep the wind out, if it is slightly breezy. There are several teak tables with umbrellas and chairs While the area is sometimes active with people, the feel is still one of relaxation,The room was clean and bright. Great shower and fresh linens.You can walk a block to several restaurants and a starbucks or local coffee house, ice cream too!. The pier is also right there to walk out on and watch the surfers, or look for seals or dolphins or to see if any of the folks fishing have caught anything.We rented bikes around the corner only $6 hr and we pedaled down the bike trail past santa monica to pacific pallisades beach. The day before we took a long walk to the santa monica pier, whoch was about an hour walk on the pedestrain walking trail that goes along the ocean. We had ride back to the hotel with a friend. We sat on the beach one afternoon and just enjoyed the sand and sun.It was very nice to fall asleep at night with the sound of the waves coming thru the shuttered windows of our room.This is kind of a no frills hotel but has many amenties such as coffee, tea , juice, pastries, wireless access, microwave and fridge, hair dryer, flat screen tv with many channels, and very friendly manager and staff as well as the patio and roof top deck.We love the ocean front rooms. There is also a suite that has kitchenette and living room.We will stay here again. We were saying that it would be a great place to be in the winter during rainy weather too, watching the big waves and enjoying the sound of the rain.

<Content>Could not have been better! Our stay at the Venice on the Beach Hotel in Venice CA was wonderful. The hotel location was great, right on the boardwalk, facing the beach... and only a few blocks from the Muscle Beach area and many restaurants and shops in Venice. I personally enjoyed the comfortable feeling of this smaller hotel. I so enjoyed the laid back atmosphere.... which is what Venice Beach is all about. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. There is no doubt that we will stay at this hotel again on our next visit to Venice Beach.

<Content>Beach motel This is a very well-located, refreshed motel, not really a hotel as most frequent travelers would understand a hotel to be. It's best for travelers who like to stay in little inns, guest houses, motels, and nicer hostels and who seek out a fun adventure (rather than travelers who seek the consistency of moderate to pricey chain hotels). For what it is, Venice on the Beach is definitely a #4, which is why I ranked it as such, but I myself was surprised when I drove up to it because the reviews on TripAdvisor made it sound like it was a different kind of establishment. Instead it's very down home with some nice features. Just for context, I am a female business traveler who travels frequently and solo. While I usually stay in mid-range business hotel chains (Hyatt, Hilton group, Starwood group, etc.), , in my personal travel I like high-end hotels and resorts as well as artsy, cool little places off the beaten path.The really positive things about Venice on the Beach: great location right on the beach, warm and friendly staff, laid back and independent feel, good wireless, comfortable bed and pillows, soft, fresh white linens, rooms conveniently appointed, two great outdoor public areas to hang out which look directly out onto the beautiful beach where many people are jogging, walking their dogs, and enjoying the beach. Despite the action, it is relatively quiet.Less appealing things about it: The feel is definitely that of an older motel that has a fresh coat of paint (without having stripped the old paint first) and new windows and bathroom fixtures. There was some nice effort made, but the finishes and workmanship are a bit rough. As a solo female traveler, I would not have felt comfortable walking around the area at night, but I had a car. There are a few parking spaces in front of the building that are first come, first served. I didn't have trouble parking when I returned after dinner, but reportedly it is harder to find parking in the winter. I don't know what I would have done if all the parking spots were taken as street parking is very restricted around that area.My room was small but had a big window looking directly out on the beach (which I paid extra for but was worth it). The window had pretty white wood shutters. The bed was comfortable with fresh white cotton linens. The rest of the furniture (desk, nightstand) was white laminate that was peeling or stained in some areas. There was a small fridge and microwave in the room. Ceramic tile floor, small bathroom with new fixtures and a ceramic tile shower. Generally clean but because the redecorating was done roughly, the overall feeling is new finishes in a worn context. On the other hand, I fell asleep and woke up to the sound of the ocean right outside my window. Although I heard other guests when they were in public areas, my night itself was quiet and peaceful. I did not eat the continental breakfast in the morning, but there are packaged pastries, coffee, and tea set out. The staff was welcoming, accommodating, and warm. Well located for beach, restaurants, major highways, Venice, Santa Monica, and Marina del Rey. If you have a few extra hours, drive up to Malibu beaches along the coast.

<Content>What a gem! If you are into doormen, concierges, room service, and bell hops this hotel is not for you. But if you want a home away from home, the easy going feel of a country B n B, what a gem! This little place on Ocean Front Walk, just a few steps north of Venice Pier is for people who seek a laid back beach atmosphere, but with access to the wilder side of Venice Beach just a short work further North, and to the South, the more sophisticated night life and restaurants of Marina Del Rey. The staff, a two person team, general manager and housekeeper, are warm and friendly, doing all they can to make your stay comfortable. Ladies, bring your own hair dryer!

<Content>Geat experience, You have to go! I booked at Venice on the beach Hotel after reading reviews and i did the right thing!In the original plan I had to spend only 3 days but i decided to go back at then end of my planned tour in the Utah and Arizona Parks and spend the last 4 days of my holiday. The hotel is really nice, clean, with car parking and ocean front....what else do You need?Greg, the manager, is a great person, ready to help and support in any of your question.The hotel is 10 minutes walking from Muscle Beach, a few steps from restaurants, bars and bikes/rollers rentals.There is only one sad thing to say.... go back home!!

<Content>What a find! What a find! Fabulous location on the beachfront with delightful roof terrace, incredibly friendly and helpful staff (particularly manager Greg), competitive rates (especially since we had a jacuzzi bath tub) and clean, light, well decorated rooms (if slightly small). Perfect for a reasonably priced base to explore LA.

<Content>Very friendly and convenient. Great hotel. The hotel is very conveniently situated for all the goings-on in Venice and Marina Del Rey where our sons live. It's right opposite the beach once you've crossed the path. There are great places to eat with plenty of choice that are only a walk away. We often had great meals in the Terrace just round the corner. The rooms were very clean and Greg the manager was top notch. Free internet access was real bonus as were the many channels on the massive flat screen TV. We would not hesitate to book another stay. Greg treated us like friends from the very start of our two week stay and always had time to give we English visitors helpful advice on everything.Annette and Alan. England UK.

<Content>Woderfully Surpirising My wife and I booked a room mid week in July. When we arrived, we were pleasantly suprised. The hotel was intimate and right on the beach. The prices were very competitive and because the hotel was not booked to capacity, we were upgraded to and ocean view room at no extra chaged.It is a small hotel without a bar or a restaurant but it is well within walking distance of shops and restaurants.The owners are modernizing and renovating the hotel but that did not interfere with our stay.The manager was top notch without a question and I firmly believe that he is their greatest asset. I give it a 9+.

<Content>cute, clean hotel with great location! My partner and I really enjoyed our stay at Venice on the Beach hotel. We had one of the standard deluxe rooms (not ocean view). Our room was attractively decorated and very clean. It had a fridge and microwave and a big big TV. We're really not that into big big TV's but if you are, you would probably really like it. The price was very reasonable for the great location, right along the ocean front bike/pedestrian paths and steps away from the ocean itself, but far enough away from the really loud part of Venice's beachfront to be tranquil and lovely. We found the manager to be incredibly friendly and helpful as well. There was also free internet and even a computer for guests to use , along with a small continental breakfast and bottled water available anytime. The porch facing the beach was a beautiful space and they're in the process of finishing the roof as another communal space. We watched the sunset from up there and it was just breathtaking. Close to the canals (very pretty walks) and lots of dining options of varying price ranges. We didn't have a car and did just fine there. Will stay again for sure and probably in an ocean view room next time, because the price difference wasn't very great. Thanks!!

<Content>Picture Perfect I couldn't have asked for a better stay than I had at Venice on the Beach Hotel. It was amazing. There were tons of things to do outside the room, but we always came back to a clean, quaint, inviting place to stay. The management was also wonderful and made the weekend that much better. I will be going back very soon and seriously doubt I ever entertain the idea of booking my Venice Beach get-aways with anyone else.

<Content>The Best Weekend I've Ever Known... Venice On The Beach Hotel was such an amazing experience, and made for the perfect weekend get-away! The management was very helpful and extremely nice. Each room was unique and authentic in its own way.....and always clean (which is amazing being that we tracked in tons of sand). Our stay was so wonderful that we are already planning our trip back - hopefully for a longer period of time. :) This is the only hotel I will ever stay at in Venice!!! Thanks so much for the best weekend I've ever known!!

<Content>Home on the Beach We just returned from a stay at the Venice Beach Hotel located in the LA area. The hotel was a quaint botique with less than 20 rooms located on the Venice Beach just a short walk from the Pier and Washington Street. Our family was in time for a Wedding and we all stayed at the Venice Beach Hotel. It was just like home on the beach. The manager was always available and helpful and the atmosphere was so peaceful. If you're looking for a fancy, high priced place with lots of Glitz, this isn't your destination. However, if you're looking for a home away from home on the Beach in Venice, CA this is worth booking for a quite getaway.D. ReedyVersailles, KY

<Content>The Greatest Place Ever We recently hosted our daughter's wedding in California. This neccesitated all of our family flying across country to attend. We chose Venice on the Beach because of its charm and location right on the water.We are a challenging group to accomodate much less tolerate. The management at this hotel went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and all needs met. The hotel is beautiful and the staff were available for whatever. It is difficult enough planning a wedding but thankfully all our guests were well attended to by the excellent service of the staff. My husband has said the next time we come to Venice he will stay no where else but Venice on the Beach and I agree. Thanks Greg!!!

<Content>Executive Suite Stay We stayed here on memorial weekend in the executive suite. We were very happy about the proximity to the beach and activities on the boardwalk. You get a reserved parking space if you have the suite which was a big plus. Also, very close to the Canals for a stroll. The executive suite was much larger than we expected with a large kitchen, living room and bedroom. It had full size dish washer and refrigerator. Greg was friendly.The negatives were that the suite was not clean enough. The remote controls for the tv were sticky and filthy. The floor and the corners of the rooms were not as clean as they could be. The bed was only a full size and very creaky with little support. The walls were thin and the neighbors loud at night when trying to go to bed.We paid $171 for our stay for 3 adults and 1 child. It was a good value for being close to the beach but I would not pay $285 per night for it.

<Content>Horrible. Horrible Hotel Stayed for 4 nights in May of 2008. Manager Greg not fair with the room rates, gave price breaks to certain guests for ocean view but would not accomodate other guests with same promotion for regular roooms. No air conditioning in upstairs room, room was never cleaned properly, never swept under the bed, sand in shower, sheets not changed. Greg was rude and very defensive when you asked for just little things such as extra towels, like you were bothering him.Stay elsewhere, not worth it. HORRIBLE!!!!!

<Content>Friendly Atmosphere With a Great Location ! My wife and I just returned from our spring break vacation and visit with our son who lives in Venice. For the past three years wehave stayed at various motel locations around the Venice Beach area and this particular motel was by far the best location for dinning and fun for our entire family. The manager Greg heldour reservation for three months and made sure we had a room that met our needs. His pleasent personality and willingness to please surpassed many of the five star motels we've stayed at in the past.The rooms were clean and very comfortable with a mini-fridge, microwave, and new flat screen tv's. It's location was was a real plus and you can sit out on the terrrace and watch the sun set every evening as it faces the ocean. If you're a people watcher like myself, you've also found the right place at Venice on the Beach Motel.

<Content>Friendly, quiet and great for a long stay My wife and I stayed at Venice-on the Beach Hotel for a month in December 2006 and for another month in December 2007. We enjoyed our first stay so much that we convinced our family members to join us over the Christmas holidays. Most of our family members stayed a full week. There were 10 of us, two persons to each of 4 rooms and my wife and I stayed in the suite. Each of the four rooms contained a microwave oven, refrigerator, private wc /shower and a large plasma TV in addition to very comfortable new beds. The suite contained a fully equiped kitchen; a large living room with dining table, sofa, and several chairs; a bedroom with a plasma TV; and a private wc/shower. The living room easily accomodated all 10 of us for meals, conversations and entertainment. We even connected our new Wii (a type of video game) to the TV in the living room and enjoyed a variety of contests. There was a patio off the living room where we BBQed most of our meals. The manager, Greg, was exceptionally friendly and accomodating to all our requests. He made sure there was a freshly brewed pot of coffee in the hallway each morning as we got up. The hotel is located in a quiet part of Venice Beach, but was only a 3 minute walk to many good low as well as moderately high priced restaurants. Gabe's restaurant was our favorite. The hotel seems to attract a very nice clientele -- guests who enjoy talking to each other on the patio at sunset but who respect each others' privacy and quiet. We have enjoyed both stays at this hotel and hope to go back again for another month's stay. Our family members, too, enjoyed their stay and some will return this fall to use the hotel as a base for participating in the L.A. triathlon.

<Content>Loved the atmosphere  My daughter lives in Venice. While I was there we stayed in the Venice On The Beach Hotel...I figured if I were going there, I wanted to be 'on the water' and we just about were. One could not get any closer. Out the private patio (cute, clean, well furnished) and there we were! The price of $200 a night was fantastice compared to other availability. The room was very clean...although small (especially the bathroom (nice water pressure too!) it was tastefully decorated. Gotta tell you though the bed (king)  the pillows were extremely comfortable. Left the lovely shuttered windows open  nothing better to sleep by than the sound of the busting surf and breeze. The mgr. Greg, was very nice. The place felt like a little home away...very relaxing atmosphere. Would definitely recommend it. Parking is at premium but we did not have any real problems. Would I stay there again? Yes!

<Content>Avoid at all costs! I stayed there for 3 days/4 nights in February of this year. I booked through an online agency. During my layover on my way to LA, my flight was severely delayed. I called the hotel and was told by the manager, Matthew, that I didn't have a reservation. I called the online agency and they worked on dealing with the hotel while I was on the plane. I called the agency when I landed and was told that everything was taken care of.It was late at night when I arrived at the hotel. The front and rear doors of the hotels are locked in the evenings for the guests security. I rang the bell but there was no one there to let me in. I called Matthew and he told me how I could get into the building without a key. Since I didn't see Matthew until my last day there, I wasn't able to get a key and I had to break in to the hotel every night. You would be amazed how easy it was to get in late at night without a key.The room was the smallest and one of the worst hotel rooms I had ever seen. The room was never cleaned while I was there.On the morning of the day I was leaving, they were painting the trim on the building on the area were their parking is. There was quite a few white spots on my red rental car. Fortunately, the rental agency either didn't notice or didn't care.This hotel is in a great location but, unless you don't care about the quality of where you stay and like the uncertainty of a less than secure hotel, than find somewhere else to stay.

<Content>My favorite place to stay in LA I love visiting Venice Beach and The Venice on the Beach Hotel has become a particular favorite of mine. Cozy and adorable, it is the perfect place for short or long-term stays. Nestled right between Marina Del Rey and Santa Monica, the hotel is fresh and fun and full of interesting wayfayers who are easy to chat with in the open beachfront setting. Right outside, Ocean Front Walk beckons with easy beach access, nearby restaurants and great people watching. The hotel -- always cheery, clean and very capably managed -- never fails me. I always feel relaxed and happy when there to get my beach fix and to mix it up with all the glamour of LA.

<Content>This hotel was fantastic! A clean, comfortable and spacious place to stay that was reasonably priced. If you are looking for a place to stay that is right in front of the beach this is the place to be. Luckily, this hotel had nice guests during my visit (except a guy named Nelson) and our room had a kitchen, bathroom, and a plasma TV in the living room and bedroom. There was also a washer and dryer in the hotel which was fantastic b/c I could wash my dirty clothes when I came home鈥攁nd sometimes I wanted to wear something twice so I was able to wash it there. It felt like I had never left home! It was wonderful. Every afternoon the maid came in and organized our room after we left. Thus, the entire time we were able to relax without being disturbed by the maid, b/c we had put the sign on our door (good thing to remember to do when coming in the wee hours of the morning- We had left the door sign out not to disturb us while we were there, in the mornings, and put the sign out to tidy our room when we went out in the afternoon, so the room was ready when we came back.). Therefore, the maid and the manager were very helpful.So, basically my advice is: if you are not a caveman/woman and can appreciate the finer things in life and want a nice, relaxing place to go, the definitely stay here. Venice on the Beach Hotel rocks!

<Content>A room with a great view!!!! I called in advance and was advised the hotel was under renovation but I decided to book anyway. Since the hotel was this close to the beach and the rates were outstanding compared to similar properties along Ocean Front Walk, I decided to take a chance being I would not be at the property much during the day time hours anyway. My newly renovated room had an ocean view room to die for. I receiveed excellent service from the manager Matthew and the maid Anna.I have a return reservation for the month of July. I will be staying for the whole month!!!

<Content>And how much did I pay to stay here? My trip to L.A. was nice, but my hotel stay was a nightmare. Everything you hope a hotel NOT to be, Venice on the Beach was. The manager is obviously doing drugs and is incoherent to requests. I simply did NOT have my room cleaned the entire stay (4 nights), in which I had to retrieve the code from the manager (who was never there) to get my own blankets, sheets, towels, toilet paper, etc. Not only that, what happened to the complementary wine at sunset? And as far as noise goes, than god I brought ear plugs. So, after spilling my complaints politely to the manager, he told me he would refund $100 back to my card, in which he has never done. I have to contact him each time he says he will get back to me. It has been 3 weeks since I have stayed there.I would advise you to even stay at a cheap motel over this place because Venice On the Beach is not anywhere even near motel quality.

<Content>lots of potential, but many issues as they revamp This place has a nice feel and I hope they will pull it together, but there was a lot that was frustrating about my stay here. I stayed for a weekend with a group of friends and we experienced many issues.The good:* Great location - right on Venice Beach within walking distance of the main boardwalk.* Prices are very reasonable.* Room options vary - we had a standard room, one with a queen and a single bed and a suite with a kitchen and a living room.* NIce patio overlooking the beach* flat screen tvs, microwaves and minifridges in each room* Friendly manager who did his best to accomodate us (but seemed overwhelmed).* each room is decorated differently - felt more like a homey bed and breakfast than a hotel (without the breakfast).The bad:* The hotel is still under construction - it was loud and the halls were crowded with construction equipment.* They were redoing locks while we were there - we had seven people and were only given two keys to the exterior doors of the hotel.* There is not always staff onsite - the manager made several home depot runs while we were there and was only accessible by cell phone. It took several hours to check into one of our rooms.*Very limited parking - there were ~18 rooms but only about 6 parking spots.* Cleaning services poor - the dishwahser in the suite was full of dirty dished from the previous occupant, trashcans were not emptied daily, and the bathrooms were not very clean.* Bad soundproofing in the roomsGood or bad depending on your perspective:* They accept dogs
